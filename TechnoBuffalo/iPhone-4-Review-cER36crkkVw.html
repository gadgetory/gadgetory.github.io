TechnoBuffalo here is my official review
for you of the iPhone 4 I wanted to wait
a couple weeks to get a sense of the
pros and cons with the device I think
I've got a better sense of how it works
so sit back relax and enjoy the video ok
so let's start at the top of what
matters most this is a phone it's got to
make good phone calls and I will say
that the call quality and the fidelity
of the signal is drastically improved of
the outgoing iPhone the 3GS and
certainly the 3G that preceded it now I
know what you're thinking John what
about the death grip or if those you
that might not know it's one of the
things that makes the iPhone have the
improve signal strength is its new
fangled antenna look at say the left
side of the device
this whole stainless steel band is
actually an antenna and that little gap
right there is what's causing all this
trouble if you bridge that gap the piece
of your finger or some part of your hand
you are going to experience a signal
drop and eventually a no signal sign
which it could be a bit of a problem I
demonstrated this on video so if you
hold the phone for example with your
left hand and your palm is sitting that
little area you're not going to see your
bar start to drop down it's a real
legitimate concern and I did have that
problem till I realized what you need to
be done and I'll just change the way
that I held my phone and certainly I
know that you should have to I know this
probably isn't unique to just the iPhone
but if you are an iPhone 4 user it's
going to become a reality of how you
deal with your device and there's going
to have to hold it differently or put a
case on it which will fix the problem
altogether now Apple has said this is
just a software issue and will be fixed
an upcoming update although as of this
filming we have not seen that update yet
and it is still most definitely a
problem so if you change where you hold
your phone you're going to notice very
clear call quality few drop calls which
is certainly something I was very happy
about over the outgoing 3GS my
experience many drop calls and that
seems to have been fixed whether that's
the iPhone 4 or 18 t improving their
infrastructure really yet to be seen
let's go ahead and jump on to some of
the new features that's found in the
iPhone 4 let's start with what you look
at all the time the 3.5 inch multi
such Retina display and retina displays
a fancy way to say a really high res
screen because the resolution of 960 by
640 pixel resolution which is the
highest resolution phone on the market
and it really comes into play looking at
a website for example text looks crystal
clear if you zoom all the way in you
don't see any sort of pixelation almost
looks like you're looking at ink which
is really really a handy feature if you
a lot of reading on your phone it also
makes pictures pop and video look a bit
more vibrant one of the things I've
really really enjoyed about the iPhone 4
if you want to see any more about these
features be sure to check out the
YouTube channel I go into detail about
the Retina display and the rest of the
things that I'm going to talk about all
right so next let's talk about cameras
and we got to start with the top about
this guy right here the front-facing VGA
camera which is really tied into Apple's
video chatting software called FaceTime
which I gotta say is incredibly cool it
works very very very well although it is
only over Wi-Fi but if you have a strong
Wi-Fi same time first your calling is a
strong Wi-Fi signal it works very well
and again I have a video demonstrating
sort of how this works I mean the things
that's not really being mentioned is
it's also an awesome free voice over IP
client when you use FaceTime it does not
deduct from your minutes I actually got
a phone call from a friend in the UK and
we talked on FaceTime for about 25
minutes on our cell phones just below
your at home I were able to talk to each
other and see each other so this does
work internationally and it won't take
any of your data or minutes because
you're going to be over Wi-Fi the video
quality is fantastic Galia fidelity is
surprisingly good and it just works very
well something that sort of makes a fun
extra feature so talking about cameras
as well on the back we've got a new 5
megapixel sensor with an LED flash now a
lot of cameras on the market have higher
sense all sensors don't necessarily let
the megapixel count flew into thinking
this is going to be a lower quality
camera the camera is actually very good
take pictures that are definitely
comparable to other 8 megapixel sensors
on there and again I have videos
comparing camera quality here to other 8
megapixel devices but the camera quality
is really good and drastically improved
over the 3G
s and I'm not going to go through and
talk about necessarily iOS for
particular points however just say that
iOS 4 doesn't work very well on device
handles multitasking very well and it
doesn't really have any sort of slow
down and make people have seen with iOS
4 on other legacy devices so next let's
move on to battery life as you can
probably guess I am a heavy heavy phone
user I'm on the phone all the time I'm
doing emails internet and battery life
has been a problem for me I could
generally get through just about one day
with my iPhone 3GS I'm not talking about
the quotes that numbers at Apple is
putting out for battery life this is a
real-world usage so clicked it to Wi-Fi
most of the day brighten is set up to
about 75% emails being pushed in a very
constant web browsing on the 3GS like I
said I could barely get through a day
now with the iPhone 4 but time I plug it
into night with the same settings in the
same e usage I generally have about 40%
of my battery left which means I could
probably get through just about a day
and a half which is fantastic I don't
mind charging my phone every night fact
I can get through a day without having
to worry about it really is great the
battery in here is significantly
improved over weights off the outgoing
models new design and a bit larger so if
battery life is a concern for you do not
worry
you're actually going to get fantastic
battery life here so there are something
else sort of going on here too there's a
new a 3-axis gyroscope we really haven't
had the chance to use it very much only
a few games take advantage of it what
that's going to mean is with previous
generation iPhones that accelerometer so
it sets move it left and right it's now
going to sense forward and back are
really across the sixaxis platta sort of
three-dimensional shapes so you can
really move the phone and get some more
some more fun at it well we haven't seen
developers take advantage of that quite
yet not much to talk about so next let's
go ahead and talk about how the whole
features sort of come together for our
phone the iPhone is very polarizing
device
people either love the iPhone hate the
iPhone love Apple or hate Apple I will
say that I review a lot of devices and
the iPhone is my daily phone of choice
and that really is for one particular
reason and that
the web browsing the web browsing for me
is one of the most important features to
have on a mobile device like I said you
guys would probably guess I'd be most of
my business online being able to have a
browser that can play what I needed to
play and work I need it to work is
fantastic I certainly the lack of Flash
has been an issue however html5
compatibility has really stepped up and
been a nice sort of inclusion so with
Web OS 4 or sorry iOS 4 not webOS I you
can play videos inside of the browser
and you get sort of a lot of improved
web browsing experience so certainly
from that aspect the iPhone 4 has been a
great device something I've been really
happy with its small it's in it fits in
the pocket very well it's not
necessarily so flashy everybody's got an
iPhone nowadays but for my needs it
suits me very well let's talk about
negatives because there are some
negatives to talk about with the iPhone
4 it certainly not all roses and candy
nail clients is still awful so we
finally have multiple exchange accounts
which is great you thread a messaging
which is great
I still can't star favorite emails
pretty much on the options I have is to
move it to a folder or markers unread
and that is about it the mail client in
here is not very good it's not on par
with Android devices it's not on par
with webOS or s I've been on par with
Windows Mobile the outgoing legacy 6.5
models the email client is just not very
good through a heavy email user you're
going to be better served the Blackberry
or another device that's what we rely on
primarily with an iPhone you are going
to have some problems one other thing
that I want to talk about pretty quickly
is the keyboard turn they all seen the
keyboard on many videos the algorithms
here do look to be improved um actually
having much more accuracy at the iPhone
4 keyboard I did at the outgoing 3GS so
now there's something to keep in mind
another sort of negative into the
Penhale if the device is sort of apples
walled garden that's sort of implicit
when you buy an iPhone 4 are you be able
to live within the limitations and the
answer for me is yes I can sometimes I
wish that I had a bit more openness to
it but for the most part it has not been
a problem I'm a big fan of Android and
other operating systems and they sort of
offer that alternative if you're
interested but know you're getting into
with the
phone know that you're going to have
some hard time sort of getting
everything you want out of entertaining
it for how you like to customize up a
few exceptions of background and folders
and speaking of folders we are still
looking at a very stale albeit elegant
and functional operating system that's
earlier they changed very much since
generation one actually looking at just
rows of icons and now you can put them
into folders but really things are as
they are and they haven't really
improved that much so if you're looking
for a very complex file management
system or better way to serve a range or
your icons arrange your homescreen or
for that matter you can get some
lockscreen notifications so I open my
phone all I can see is the time and date
you're really going to want to look
elsewhere
certainly there are jailbreaking options
which you can do but if you want to keep
your phone to refresh and with its
warranty jailbreaking may not be the
best option for you and you're gonna
have to live with what Apple provides
and what they provide is a very nice
package and a very well-rounded package
but there are a lot of big question
marks as to why why didn't they they've
sort of been addressing those why didn't
days one by one cut copy and paste
finally came multitasking finally km
tethering finally came so hopefully
you're going to see those at some point
I'll hopefully at that that point served
they haven't been passed by other
manufacturers so if I could put all this
together in sort of a final summation
the iPhone 4 gets a very solid four and
a quarter out of five stars from me that
serve three quarters that's missing I
would have liked to seen some additional
features like I mentioned homescreen
notifications would have been very nice
so news and new notification systems in
general without the obtrusive okay or
canceled serve disrupt over you're doing
something like how the Palm Pre with
webos notifications or Android with a
pull down tray I really would have made
this now brings them itself and a phone
definitely pop hardware standpoint I
think the hardware here is top-notch
it's fast it's quick does how many and
you slow down the eight for
system-on-a-chip
coupled with 512 megabytes of RAM makes
this thing a screamer and it's very very
very fast speaker quality is great
camera quality is fantastic and the
phone works very well certainly I wish I
didn't have to deal with the death grip
but so far has not
that'd be a problem I may pick up a
bumper case for it I would sort of
alleviate that in the short-term its
overall I've been very happy with the
iPhone this is what I take with me when
I go out when I'm doing whatever I may
be doing this is what's always in my
pocket so if that tells you anything at
the phone extremely enjoy oh there are
other fantastic alternatives out there
the iPhone is the one that I choose to
take with me so me guys for all these
