February Apple's patent for a method for
mood based at delivery steamos gets
dual-boot more sports content for the
xbox one and every nes start screen ever
stuff allah bolton time hello internet
and welcome to the buffalo bulletin
where we recap stories from our site
technobuffalo calm every tuesday and
friday if you're interested in reading
more about any story on the show check
the description below for links or click
on the graphics if you have annotations
available and toggle on I'm Ashley sceva
here your top stories it seems like only
yesterday we were roaming the show floor
at CES but CES is so last week no key
has already got an invite out for a
February 24th event there isn't much
revealed on the invite itself aside from
a cryptic meet us under the tree
whatever that means it's possible we'll
see the phone currently dubbed the Lumia
icon which is a 5-inch 1080p windows
phone 8 device or even the highly
curious Normandy phone which is that
Android smartphone developed by Nokia
then again maybe we'll see no new
devices and we'll just hear more about
Nokia's plans to transition its mobile
business to Microsoft over in super
weird and a little creepy news apple
filed a patent for a method of ad
serving that works based on the user's
mood traditionally ads are served based
on your interest so things like your web
history and searches come into play but
apple's patent gathers data based on
actions choosing a mood and then giving
a confidence score for that mood so
maybe you're listening to sad love songs
after a breakup on iTunes and Apple
serves you ads in Safari for a dating
site apple also describes sensors and
face recognition software in the patent
but for now it's just theoretical but it
could easily be translated for future
real world views in gaming steamos
continues to work out the kinks in its
beta and recently valve not only added
support for non Nvidia graphics cards
they also gave steamos the ability to
dual-boot and create custom partitions
of course valve warns users the features
haven't been thoroughly tested with
valve engineer John verte stating don't
install it on any machine you are not
prepared to lose of course that's all
part of a beta and if you've got an
experimental rig hanging
around a home it might be worth checking
out official steam machines will arrive
later this year with a wide variety of
price tags attached Microsoft is working
really hard on making its console the
centerpiece of your living room and this
week the xbox one took another step in
that direction they announced they've
established a partnership with IPTV
provider new lion that will give Xbox
one users access to both 24 7 linear
channels and on-demand sports content in
addition the streams will include
real-time statistics for hardcore fans
no word yet on which sports will
actually be showing a new lion or even
when the service is expected to launch
on Xbox one but hopefully they'll get it
up and running in time for either march
madness or maybe major league baseball
season open our wildcard story today is
the throw back to the good old glory
days of the nes for those of us out
there who have fond memories of booting
up our nes and blowing into cartridges
to make them work a very intrepid fan
has collected and cut together every
single press Start screen appearing in
an NES game youtube user an explosion FX
says it took him forever to complete the
video which we can tell by its nearly 3
hour run time it's pretty great though
and well worth flipping through to find
your favorite 8-bit titles as soon as I
saw maniac mansion in milan serie castle
i am telling you all the nostalgia right
in the feels that's the buffalo bulletin
