CES is being able to check out my
favorite brands or the products that I
already know and love that I know
there's new stuff coming out for so I
was really stoked to head over to the
Jay Berg booth to check out the X 3s and
the Jaber freedoms there's a lot of
really cool new stuff with these things
mainly support for the my sound app the
my sound app not only gives you an
enormous amount of control but this is
where they differentiate from other
brands that are doing something similar
they actually save those profiles to
your device which means that it doesn't
really matter what device you're
listening to music on because those
profiles go with you no matter what they
thought they would have to compromise in
terms of sound quality to get the size
down to a reasonable place but you know
what turns out the freedoms are just the
most comfortable headphones I've ever
reward and they sound fantastic this
isn't a review just a quick first look
but gosh darn it
they are so nice not to mention they
have a really cool mechanism for
charging you plug the micro USB cable
into a little charger cradle then you
connect that to the actual little inline
controls in the headphones they charge
through there but the kicker is that
charger is actually also backup so when
you go hiking and you run out of battery
you need to top-up
you're not even sweating because that
little charger has four extra hours of
play time in there I know you guys know
that I'm a pretty big jaybird fanboy and
you're probably going to be screaming
bias but I cannot wait to get my hands
on the day bird freedoms thank you guys
so much for watching if you're into CES
steena coverage then you want to keep it
right here at TechnoBuffalo thank you
again so much for watching
you kind of one another and I'll catch
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
