Hazleton from technobuffalo i'm here at
Mobile World Congress in Barcelona are
checking out the galaxy s5 and real
quick I just wanted to show you some of
the features compared to the Galaxy Note
3 because in some ways they're similar
devices in some ways they're not you've
got the snapdragon 800 processor for
example under the hood but you look at
the back on this one of course you've
got the new 16 megapixel camera really
powerful software it's got an additional
chip to help make sure that you take the
clearest pictures and then on the galaxy
note 3 of course you've got just the the
13-megapixel I shouldn't say just is
still a great hammer and then also here
you have the single LED flash but also
the heart rate sensor which is one of
the new features on the galaxy s5 and
just for a size comparison here you can
see the difference between the display
sizes sorry for going off camera there
so you still get a really big display on
the galaxy s5 without it being too big
and that's sort of what Samsung did with
the galaxy s4 or two so they sort of
increased the screen size without
increasing the actual size of the phone
too much and then down here of course it
doesn't look like it and it almost looks
like the same is on the Galaxy Note 3
but this is a fingerprint reader so
really cool technology there and then if
you look on the ports the note 3
obviously is uncovered it's covered on
the galaxy s5 because it's ip67
water-resistant dust resistance so you'd
sort of drop this in the toilet where
you probably don't want to do that with
the Galaxy Note 3 but anyway just wanted
to give you a quick comparison just so
you could see how they size up and and
what they look like next to one another
especially if you see or hear about any
comparisons between the back because
they moved away from the glossy feel
here and it's sort of soft touch almost
leathery field just like on the note 3
any case quick comparison here this is
