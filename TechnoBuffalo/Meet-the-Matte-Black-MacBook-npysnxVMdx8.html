personality you can change the color of
your shoes but it comes to our
electronics there's much a reflection of
who we are as people as the clothes that
we wear but we're stuck with what they
look like the manufacturer when it comes
to Apple generally it's a shade of
silver the MacBook you got a few other
color options but that's about it well
my favorite computers ever was the old
matte black classic Mac books from like
2006 2007 I actually loved that look
enter the folks at color ware who can
turn your electronics into anything you
want they can customize the color of a
trackpad customize the color of a back
they can add a custom logo for you so I
wanted to pick up a macbook for my home
home use I've been using my wife's quite
a bit and I figured I wanted something
kind of different I didn't want
something very flashy to reach out to
folks of color where to see if they
maybe want to work on something together
to get a computer that was custom for me
and you could pick from a ton of colors
I mean there are thousands and thousands
of options you can change and customize
I went for a classic look according to
folks of color where it's the only time
they've ever done this design so I guess
I can say this is a one-of-a-kind
computer whole thing is matte black the
back is matte black the body is matte
buck even the trackpad is matte black we
came to the logo instead of going white
I wanted a glossy black logo and it
looks absolutely gorgeous there are some
specks of color that almost looks like
glitter and it looks really understated
to me I didn't want anything overly
flashy
I want something it just was uniquely
neat this computer started its life as a
Space Gray MacBook and differences are
subtle versus the Space Gray nothing
drastic the way a color where does it is
pretty awesome it's not a skin you can
peel off and remove it's not a case they
actually will take the computer apart
and will custom paint every single
component on the outside to get you the
look that you want
the design studio is very similar to
moto maker and you pick your colors and
you can send it off to color we're
concerned a lot of people have though
with it is a warranty if you buy the
computer whatever you're doing directly
from color where they'll get a year
warranties I just love the simplicity of
this look I
the matte-black the computer work -
performs exactly that if it was brand
new
the team at track pet feels different
they usually the shiny feel that you get
but it worked just like everything else
if you guys want to check out color
where I'll link to them down below thank
you to them and what computer would you
design what colors do you guys want
would you go crazy would you do like a
red hinge and a blue logo to put a
custom logo on the back of the Apple
logo go to your thoughts on it wait
think about my design until next time
I'm generator TechnoBuffalo see you guys
