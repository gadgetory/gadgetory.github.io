from TechnoBuffalo here's an unboxing
for you that I'm really excited about
this is the white 32 gig iPad to Verizon
3G model let's go ahead and dig in so I
went white and Verizon I figured my iPad
one that I had was black and on AT&amp;amp;T
would go the exact opposite for
comparison purposes so here is the box
of course this is going to come in 16 32
and 64 gigabyte varieties in all white
and black and available on AT&amp;amp;T or
Verizon 3G network picture of the white
iPad on the front of course you get the
black one that picture will be black
Apple logos on the side iPad iPad and
some bidness here if you do get a 3g
version you do not have to activate it
in the store we will bring back senior
stabby the obligatory big ol knife and
we will cut the plastic here go ahead
and slice that on open see that's enough
to peel back this plastic you figure of
all the unboxings I would be a plastic
cutting pro by now but I'm not so we got
plastic off there is a head to go ahead
and take off the box here just uh some
cardboard on top there is the iPad
almost as you look there's anything in
the box just a screen because the white
frame matches the box go ahead and lift
up that tab on first blush iPad 2
definitely feels thin it definitely
doesn't feel all that much thinner
though than the first gen despite being
about 33% thinner
push it off to the side for just one
moment we'll see what else we're gonna
get in the box so it's probably not
going to be too surprising here we've
got your design by Apple in California
question I always get are there Apple
stickers so we've got some little tips
and tricks about it and there are your
two Apple stickers we'll go ahead and
hello
that up usb-cable with apples 30-pin
character looks to be the same one that
we saw up to lunch Jen and it looks like
the same size power adapter as well but
that's not the exciting part let's go
ahead and take a look at the iPad 2 all
right so now we've got the iPad 2 out of
the box let's go ahead and take a look
it's going to be very familiar to
anybody who's seen an iPad or really any
Apple device recently it's mostly all
screen with the exception of that one
home button right on the front of course
this one is in white let's do a real
quick tour on the front you've got a new
VGA camera for FaceTime you can take
video or stills with it although
presumably not at the highest quality on
the left you're going to have nothing
see that tapered design on the right
you've got your volume rocker up and
down and you've got a rotation lock or a
mute switch you can now choose what
you'd like that to be on the back the
Verizon or AT&amp;amp;T 3G models are going to
be adorned with the black antenna if you
have the Wi-Fi only model it's going to
be just aluminum or aluminium depending
on where in the world you are and we've
got a rear camera capable of shooting
720p video I would also take stills
we've got a power and lock button on the
top right there 3.5 millimeter headset
jack which is non recessed on the bottom
30 pin connector it's apples proprietary
it's now actually become a standard and
kind of weird to say proprietary
standard and a new redesigned speaker
which is located right on the bottom
previous generation iPads have the
speaker right next to the 30-pin
connector on first blush it feels a
little bit thinner but not that
noticeable it definitely feels a little
bit lighter however because of the
design you also don't have that iPad
wobble that we saw with the
first-generation when you put on a flat
surface it's not gonna move very much
and speaking of the first generation
let's go ahead and bring that in for you
real quick
comparison so here is Gen 1 iPad you can
see there's a little bit of wobble that
I was talking about let's go ahead and
stack these guys right on top of each
other so you can see the 33% Fitness
difference and to help you decide
whether or not this is going to be the
right iPad for you if you go with the
AT&amp;amp;T model this is the Verizon version
as I mentioned you also have a
Micro SIM slot as well so here is the
iPad 2 also for demonstration purposes
and I'll show you this in upcoming
videos I have a Smart Cover this is the
red leather version and also has a
microfiber cleaning cloth sort of
embedded in it on the other side I'll do
a full demonstration of this as well and
see if it's going to be worth your
hard-earned money for all your iPad 2
news including comparisons vs the first
generation iPad and even the Motorola
Xoom be sure to stay tuned to the
channel and to TechnoBuffalo we put in
all these two head-to-head to see which
one is best for you and speaking of the
Motorola Xoom let's bring that in to for
a real quick size comparison we'll go
ahead and stack them see that there's
definitely difference their iPad 2 is a
little bit thinner but the zoom is
definitely a little bit narrower so push
those off and we'll be doing a full
comparison between these two kings of
the tablets world anyway I am John Rhett
enger' and I will see you in the next
video
buh-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
