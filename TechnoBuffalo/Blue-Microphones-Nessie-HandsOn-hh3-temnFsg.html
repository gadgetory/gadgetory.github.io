bringing you guys some more namm 2013
coverage this time we're taking a first
look at the Nessie from blue a lot of
guys who are familiar with blue know a
lot of youtubers and podcasters have
used the snowball in the Yeti this is
their next generation Nessie so it's
kind of like the snowball but on
steroids if I had to describe it you got
a cardioid condenser capsule what's
awesome those that they actually include
not only a pop filter built right into
the microphone but they also include
shock absorption so that was always one
of my complaints with this snowball or
even the Yeti if you had remotely any
noise on your desk it's going to pick
that up so not only is it going to
reduce those pops and save you money of
having to buy a pop filter but the shock
absorption is going to give you cleaner
and more focused audio now in addition
to an awesome flexible adjustable head
which blue is touting as serpentine
flexibility they're also going to get
three recording modes one which is
geared for vocals so that's for podcasts
for YouTube it's going to give you the
best possible sound directly out of the
microphone and it's going to take the
guesswork so you don't got to eq
compress anything it's all built right
there into that setting and then after
that you have instrument mode so it's
going to bring out the detail on things
like acoustic guitar ukulele or even
drums and then finally you have raw mode
which is pure unadulterated audio but
you can still take advantage of the pop
filter as well as the shock absorption
now lastly the Nessie also features a
built-in zero latency headphone output
so you can hear yourself and then you
can conveniently adjust that volume up
or down simply by turning the bottom
base on the microphone and on top of
that they have what they call instant
mute so you literally just tap and the
built-in LED will kind of pull state to
go off and on to let you know that the
mute is engaged and when you tap it
again the LED will go fully lit not
pulsating and let you know that the mute
is disengaged aside from that from first
impressions it looks like Blue's got a
winner on their hands with the Nessie
obviously time will tell with the full
review comparisons and obviously audio
test but for now on paper it looks like
a badass microphone if you guys want to
know more make sure to check out the
