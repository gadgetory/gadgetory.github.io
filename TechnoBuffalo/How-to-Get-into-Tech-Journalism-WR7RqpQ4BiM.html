to you by lynda.com what's going on
everyone and welcome back to episode of
retrogression we're continuing with our
get to know the staff series we've
already talked to Roy Choi we talked to
Todd Hazleton now we're talking to the
man himself mr. Brandon Russell if you
ever read an article on TechnoBuffalo
com chances are probably usually about a
40% chance maybe 35% chance is written
by this gentleman sitting right here
Brandon Russell is our senior editor of
special projects and mobile so Brandon
welcome welcome so tell us a little bit
about yourself how you came to
TechnoBuffalo a little about myself I
like I enjoy soccer interesting I enjoy
reading a good book
do you remember her about soccer I do
actually I've read a few they're pretty
good a little bit about how I came
TechnoBuffalo about three years ago I
decided on a whim to reach out to John I
didn't hear back unfortunately the first
time I reached out I was actually
interning at a local magazine here so I
thought you know why not I'll just reach
out see what happens I didn't hear back
about three months later I still see
that email went to spam boxing yeah I
don't really think that's true about
three months later I actually finished
my internship I actually started working
for the company but I thought why don't
I just follow up and see if anything has
changed by now and actually you reached
out he said hey let's start talking you
fed my information to Sean and then kind
of the rest is history
yeah Brandon's timing was perfect his
first day was actually our first day in
the office that were announced we're
looking to sort of staff up and it was
sort of a yeah it worked out perfect
perfect
fit so bring your really prolific writer
how many articles per day would you say
that you're right on average you know
I'm not quite as fast as Todd he could
kind of crank them out and out of
seconds it seems like but you know it
just depends on the news of the day
what's interesting what's not
interesting cuz I kind of get fed up
with some of these articles that are out
here but I mean on a good day is
probably like 10 or 12 on a slower day
it's like five or six it's obviously in
tech there's a lot of topics you write
about how do you pick what you want to
write about versus what you don't want
to write about and how do you sort of
marry the having the right content
versus writing constants interesting to
you well I guess the first part is what
we think the audience will find if
you're seeing beyond that you know I
know myself and the rest of the staff
kind of have a preference of what to
write about that's why we kind of go
with a lot of opinion pieces and that's
why I've kind of gravitated towards the
longer stuff because that's what I enjoy
I try and put a story behind a lot of
stuff that I do I may not come across in
shorter pieces you know just like the
quick this device is getting an update
sort of piece but I mean with the blimp
piece and with some of my opinions and a
little bit in my reviews I try and tell
a story because that's why I enjoy doing
the Occulus piece yeah exactly so I kind
of gravitate towards that that's why I
was lucky enough to get the special
projects I got some stuff I'm actually
working on right now so what does that
mean so special products might sound too
nebulous to people you know we try to
give it a tech angle but if it doesn't
necessarily have an immediate technical
we try and look at it from the
perspective that you know our audience
our core audience would would like to
see it at so you just got back you just
got back from a trip yeah you know
actually I got to participate in a NASA
I actually went up to the Jet Propulsion
lab in Pasadena and they showed us
around
the building up there we actually got to
see you might have seen a little bit on
Twitter we got to see the sister of the
Mars Curiosity rover we got to sit in
the control room of the launch actually
that happened a few years ago and then
the day after that we got to go out to
Barstow California and we actually got
to see the Deep Space Network so that
was really interesting take a quick

so Brent a lot of people might want to
be exactly where you are sitting where
you're sitting writing what you're
writing what advice would you have for
someone who's inspiring to be a tech
journalist or not my journalist I think
kind of what really touched touched on
last episode just to kind of keep
writing do as much writing as you can
you know there's a period when I didn't
even really want to write I just kind of
happened to get into it and then I
figured out more and more that this was
something I really wanted to do so if
you have an opportunity like I did to in
turn somewhere you should definitely
reach out to that and seize that
opportunity you know like Roy said read
a lot get writing out there you know
criticism is okay because I mean I'm not
perfect Todd's not perfect you know none
of us are perfect here but I just
learned from
keep riding you'll grow I know
early on when I first got here I was
really struggling with you know keeping
up with the amount of content we we need
to push out to you guys just keep at it
and you'll eventually you know you'll
grow you you'll get better and then you
know who knows you might get a job
working for John one day working you
know somewhere else that you're
passionate about you're Brandon's was it
your second day was the iPhone 5 event
yeah the Brandon's second day here was
probably the busiest day we've ever had
it's yeah iPhone 5 is the the busiest
day we've ever had in a company I was
sure Brandon we're gonna go to lunch and
never and never come back yeah I was
pretty overwhelming that day so so if
you can get through things like that you
can get through you can get the
reinvention and this is your knife later
you well came back yeah thence events

but you know back then when you haven't
really experienced anything like that
