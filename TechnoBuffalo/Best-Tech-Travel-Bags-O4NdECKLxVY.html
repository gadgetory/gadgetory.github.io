from TechnoBuffalo and if you guys
remember about a week and a half ago I
did a what's in my bag video today I
have a follow-up to that not exactly
what's in my bag since that much hasn't
changed but rather what are some
alternative bags for alternative uses
that I would recommend in this case
specifically what are some awesome
travel bags I have three options today
for you guys to look at let's go ahead
and get started so the first bag we're
going to be looking at is the in case yo
travel backpack now this one's been
around for a while but it's still a
really really good versatile bag it's a
little bit on the bigger side but with
that comes a lot of storage options you
get a big pocket in the middle to put
your clothes with a mesh lining just
like you have in a suitcase so it's
practically a suitcase with straps it
was really cool for me because I can
slide in you know two three pairs of
jeans and couple t-shirts and whatever
else I need for a couple days trip an
alternative use for this sort of middle
pocket and kind of for all these
backpacks is you can use it as a camera
storage area so this is the real big
thing I use these bags for since they
have more space I'll very often use them
as camera bags with my laptop and hard
drives basically I can fit everything I
need to for one big day of filming in
this one backpack another feature that
makes this bag a dream for filmmaking
for me are the four buckles two on each
side that allow you to put tripods in
the side and use them as holsters
outside of that those bag leaves plenty
of room for me to put my 15-inch MacBook
Pro and the SSDs and you backup hard
drives that I have external battery
packs and anything and everything in
between much like a lot of other incase
backpacks this has made very very high
quality and you won't have it breaking
down anytime soon this backpack will
last you a while which is nice
considering that it's a hundred and
eighty dollars which is pretty expensive
but well worth it in my opinion and
before continuing on I want to thank our
friends at best fiends forever for
sponsoring this video best fiends is a
game that you can get on iOS and it's a
very simple game at first I didn't
really understand it felt like a lot of
button mashing but as you get past level
50 it becomes a lot more about strategy
you basically are a fiend I guess or a
bug and you fight off giant slugs and
it's kind of fun what's also cool is as
you go on you can add on new effects
gain coin
use those coins to give characters
boosts power-ups all sorts of things the
game is free so I highly recommend that
you go check it out you have nothing to
lose I personally had a blast playing it
and will be in the near future and now
back to the bags if you want to take
things up to the next level in terms of
price you can check out air that's AE r
they make a very similar backpack and
I'm going to highlight the differences
rather than going over all the basics
again the first and the biggest
difference is going to be the price the
air travel pack is gonna be coming in at
two hundred and twenty dollars so it's
more expensive than the in case for sure
this price difference is going to
manifest itself with build quality the
big thing is that the air backpack is
made with ballistic nylon the ballistic
nylon does increase durability so if
you're looking for a backpack that can
really take a beating this one's
probably going to do better than the
incase however it does add some extra
weight when the backpack is empty and
filled up and it does make the bag a
little bit stiffer as well
so it's really just down to what your
preference is other minor differences
are the bag actually opens like a
clamshell versus the incase bag opens
more like a regular suitcase and
probably the last notable difference
you'll see is that instead of having a
mesh lining for your clothes you'll have
a chute compartment inside the big main
pocket so there's a different way to
organize your stuff and if neither of
these bags are durable enough for you I
have one more quick recommendation from
GORUCK the GR two this is literally
Special Forces grade materials that
they're using here this is probably the
most durable bag you will ever want it
comes in a different price point it is
almost four hundred dollars so be ready
to spend some money on this one however
if you are there for security and want
your laptop to be in a bomb-proof
compartment this is going to be the
backpack for you the framework of this
backpack is similar to the other ones we
talked about it's more so the materials
and the finishes and the stress points
that are tested that make this different
and put it in a class of its own in
regards to durability for me it's a
little overkill but if you are an
adventurer or you're always on the go
this is going to be the one for you and
so that's it for this video guys let me
know what you think in the comments down
below which one of these bags was your
favorite I'm very curious to hear give
us a thumbs up if you liked this video
