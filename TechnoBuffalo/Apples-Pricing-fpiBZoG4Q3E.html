to you by shutterstock.com welcome back
to another episode of Retton Jers rants
I'm your host John retinas the show
where I rant and rave on anything from
the world of technology and sometimes
outside the world technology last week I
talked about what I was thinking for the
spirit of Thanksgiving but this week I'm
back to being angry so I was thinking of
a topic for this week's right just rants
I went on to Twitter and I said hey I'm
Betty ready to film the show what do you
guys want to see ranted about what makes
you angry and overwhelmingly the
response was Apple and either their
prices or the release schedule without a
touch a little bit about both of those
and give you guys some business
background and maybe why that doesn't
deserve a rant maybe why it does is
Retton just rants let's go and get
started
Apple has long been maligned for its
pricing there is what's been called an
Apple tax people pay a premium Apple
charges a premium for their products
whether not that premium is justified or
not topic for another discussion
everybody on Twitter that I saw an ad I
think about the 20 to 30 responses I had
in the 20 minutes since I posted the
tweet wanted to talk about Apple's
pricings and why they're gouging their
customers so let me introduce you to a
little simple concept called supply and
demand it's a simple curve goes like
this goes like this and it's supply and
demand in the middle is called the
equilibrium point and that's where the
supply of a product equals a demand and
on your x and y axis you've got pricing
and the pricing is what a company can
charge to hit that equilibrium number
Apple is right now the biggest most
valuable company in the world in the
world
actually those valuable company in the
history of the stock exchange that's the
New York Stock Exchange Apple can charge
a premium for the products people will
pay them if people didn't want to pay
that premium product then the price
would go down or the demand would go
down apples profits wouldn't earn also
go down with it but people are buying
these things in droves the iPad is
selling millions save like 11 per hour
iPhones MacBooks MacBook Pros IMAX these
things are flying off the shelves Apple
is not a chair to despite what most
people think I'm like you I want to get
the products that I want for as cheap as
possible but I don't hold the company
who makes them responsible for making
the prices
inexpensive as possible Apple is not a
charity they have responsibilities to
their shareholders to maximize profits
that's capitalist society and that is
business you might not like it I don't
like it but Apple has every right in the
world to do it to charge what they want
for their product song people will buy
them if you don't agree with that bus
pricing don't buy apples products that's
the best way you can send a message to
the company now you not buying one
iPhone might not make a difference but
if everybody gets together and says hey
it's too expensive we're not gonna buy
it
Apple be forced to redress their pricing
scheme however if you're not going to
speak with your wallet then you really
have no other voice in the matter Apple
can charge anything they want any
company for that matter can charge any
price they want Apple could probably get
away charging even a higher premium for
their products based on the amount of
sales numbers that they've had so that
argument unnecessary Levi's coming from
a business background you know I get it
I understand why companies are charging
premiums it's just they're allowed to do
it certainly there's a social conscience
of company as well what they do with
that money once they make it or not they
get back to charities get back to their
employees and all those are of other
questions that can be announced now if
Apple is a very charitable company which
traditionally under the Steve Jobs era
they were not to change a little bit
undercook you could hold them
responsible for what they're doing with
their cash once they have it the other
topic that I overwhelmingly had was
Apple's release cycle slow it down stop
it stop releasing new iPads every six
months and that one yeah I kind of get
but it also comes back to that same
isn't a stand point yeah two
perspectives on that from a consumer I
get why you're pissed I bought the new
iPad the third generation I was super
excited I had the latest generation iPad
I knew that I was going to have the
latest technology for the next year I
saved up my money and I bought it and
then boom six months later iPad four
comes out with the new lightning
connector and faster stuff inside of it
and that's annoying you want to feel
like you've got the best product for as
long as you can but that's not the
reality of the world that's not the way
capitalism works Apple once again is a
for-profit company their job is to make
money they were heading into the holiday
season they want to be as competitive as
possible and iPads are flying off the
show if you disagree the release cycle
stop buying iPads stop buying iPhones
whatever product you disagree with you
can speak loudly with your wallet a way
to spend your money companies have a
right to do what they want might not
agree with it
agree with it I understand that from a
business standpoint try and change your
perspective I try not think of things
from just your point of view from the
company's point of view from the
shareholders point of view from a
business point of view and you might
start to see why companies are doing
things you do not however have to agree
with them at all I certainly don't but
it might help you appreciate a little
bit more but why companies are doing
what they're doing alright so let me
