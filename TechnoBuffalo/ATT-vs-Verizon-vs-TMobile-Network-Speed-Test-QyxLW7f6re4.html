hearing a lot about network speed either
in advertisements or on the news it's
really everywhere so I wanted to take
three of the four major carriers and do
a speed test and see how fast each of
them load the same site and put their 3g
network essentially head-to-head I've
got five bars of 3g service for ATT on
the iphone I've got five bars of 3g
service for verizon on the droid and
I've got five bars of 3g service for
tmobile on the g one unfortunately i
don't have sprint phone to throw that in
there at least you can see how three of
the four major networks compare speed
test wise we're going to load
technobuffalo com site that has been
loaded on each of these devices so it'll
be a test of visiting a website that you
check out on a regular basis so each one
now is blank to google com I'm gonna get
TechnoBuffalo queued up on each and
we'll get to the test I'm taking any
bets right now do you think is going to
win alright so I've got TechnoBuffalo
queued up on each device hitting go at
the same time in all three is going to
be the trickiest part of this test we're
going to give it a shot
that was almost exactly the same time
and we are off on all three devices now
certainly your 3G speeds are going to
vary depending on where you're at this
test is done in Southern California
looks like verizon jumped out to an
early lead ATT close second and t-mobile
is actually keeping up quite nicely we
can read content on all three sites
verizon just finished AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile
are fighting for second AT&amp;amp;T is done
just a few seconds behind Verizon and
t-mobile is still loading and we do have
full bars on each year I'm very
fortunate to get 3g reception from all
major carriers here all right and
t-mobile is done so that was sort of an
unofficial speed test of what you can
expect in this case verizon was faster
than AT&amp;amp;T i did this a few times
off-camera and out of the five times i
tried it verizon and AT&amp;amp;T tended to
split the speed test there really is
going to come down to which test that we
happen to to run and see which one won
then t-mobile was always third so at
least for my area ATT and Verizon
definitely add the faster 3g speed other
t-mobile is certainly not bad so guys
hope you enjoyed very curious as to what
you think of these tats and you get the
same results depending on where you are
do you find your verizon 3g or 18t 3g or
tmobile 3g to be fast fast enough or not
quite as fast hope you guys enjoyed for
exclusive content check me out at

and for more information on this test
and how it was conducted and for all
your tech news check out technobuffalo
