to you by loot crate what's up everyone
welcome back there pisode of Rhett
enters riffs the shower I can riff on
anything in the world of consumer
electronics this week it's all about
consumer electronics if people that
helped make the news I am joined in the
office by our head of mobile mr. Todd
easel team came out to visit yep what's
up everyone so I get a lot of in
Croatian people asking what it takes to
be in the industry or what it's like to
be a writer so we're gonna have some
question for somebody who is in the
trenches so to speak on writing just a
ton of tech Compton so you ever wanted
to get in the industry want to be an
online journalist this is a guy to
listen to it's going to get started I to
the first question I think probably on
most people's minds once again in the
industry is how did you get to where you
are what path should should people take
who want to be in the online world or
any online consumer electronics world I
think there's a lot of paths you can
take really I personally was an English
major in school so I was always writing
and I knew early on that I wanted to
write and about technology actually
because when I first went to school I
wanted to be a computer science major
and then sort is slowly gravitated over
to an English major and so but I always
had that passion with computers and
phones and has a hobby probably like a
lot of you out there and what I did then
was apply for internships to make sure
that i had a writing career lined up
after graduation and i worked for a
number of sites maximum pc magazine was
an internship Ars Technica i wrote for
gizmodo for like a week maybe and so
I've been all over and then I slowly
went and worked full-time at laptop
magazine and eventually made my way to
TechnoBuffalo we're happy to have you so
keep writing I'd say so on average how
many pieces of content do you write per
day I think it depends on the day for
sure if we have a review going out or an
opinion piece it would be fewer pieces
so maybe eight but if not then it's up
there between eight to 12 depending on
the day if it's a windows phone 8.1 day
like last week or if it's an apple WWDC
event can be as many as 18 I mean you're
really sort of pumping out content to
make sure everybody gets it what's the
hardest part of your job Oh other than
dealing no I think you know it's really
tough when you think about like what's
the hardest part because when like you
always say we're doing what we love
right so I'd say the hardest part is
making sure that we're covering enough
content that you want to read on our
homepage and making sure that we're
getting all of it up at a reasonable
pace so we don't want to be late on news
but we also can't trip on ourselves and
so that can be really frustrating so we
might want one story about the iphone 6
running say a rumor when there's also
news about say blackberry shutting down
and yet you know just for an example big
news we don't want to have one article
Trump the other one so we have to sit on
you sometimes instead of running it so
how do you and as someone who sort of
works you know who's running mobile is
sort of in charge of one of the larger
departments within the company how do
you sort of walk that line between like
okay trying to be first and then trying
to be best yeah I think that's really
one of the hardest things to do is you
can rush and get something out there
quick with just a sentence which is
sometimes valuable because you want to
make sure that someone like you out
there it gets that news first but if you
have an opinion on it always make sure
we try to make sure we follow up with an
opinion then so we might have a
one-paragraph story go up to make sure
that you get the news and then half hour
45 minutes an hour later get something
that really analyzes it so you get both
you get the speed and then hopefully you
get the quality that you're looking for
as well so we learned what the hardest
part of job is what's the best part the
best part always playing with the latest
toys and I think a technobuffalo the
people that we get to work with every
day we have a chat room that we all
talked in so even though I'm on the East
Coast I talked with these guys here on
the west coast all day long and I've
been working here for two years over two
years now and so we've had some lasting
relationships and some fun times
together playing with gadgets we never
get it really does it really it's still
like every try dude unboxing you guys
can always see my face but i'm still
like something something new we stop the
questions for just one second to thank
our friends good peeps at lucre if you
watch technobuffalo you know we love the
unboxings and that's what this is meant
for it's an unboxing of stuff for geeks
it's a subscription box service for gigs
nerds and gamers that delivers epic
items to your door every month for less
than 20 bucks including shipping and
handling this
week it was all about titanfall we got
titanfall books we got wristbands we got
t-shirts I remember I got one when was
Ombey week and a picture of an Ewok and
said he walking dead on it and it was it
was pretty awesome previous crates have
included things from Marvel Nintendo
blizzard and more so if you like geeks
and geek culture this is absolutely the
Saints subscribe to its something fun I
love getting stuff in the mail sometimes
i buy more than I showed from you know
online sites but now you know every
month you're gonna get a box filled with
really cool stuff and sometimes even
tasty stuff I can't show you but there
was tacking here that I eat and it was
super super delicious so folks at look
great have a ton of ideas for awesome
stuff but if you have an idea for a
future crate you can tell them the great
wants the crate to be perfect for the
geeks like us check them out go to loot
crate calm / techno to get ten percent
off your first order again that's loot
crate calm / techno to get ten percent
and get stuff could be out like stuff
and back to the video so what advice
would you give for people out there that
want to get industry or maybe in another
career right now or maybe I'm just
getting started in school you know what
advice can you give them uh the best
advice I'd say is to keep doing what you
really love in it it's so cliche and we
say here a lot like doing you love but I
think it's worked out for us and it's
always worked out for me and I think
really if you want to be a writer always
keep writing one of the things you need
to show some buddies that you can write
so have your own blog even if the goal
isn't building your own traffic but just
having all those samples up and your own
opinions showing people you can do that
and it really doesn't matter your
background if you're an engineer or
you're an English major like I was you
it really doesn't matter just make sure
your writing and if somebody consider
your strong writer then then somebody
like me would eventually hire you I
think so Thank You Man thank you say we
thought it'd be interesting to hear sort
of from somebody who does a lot of the
writing I don't get a chance to write as
nearly as much as I'd like to anymore
and Todd's name is littered all over all
over the site so I thought it'd be kind
of cool to serve hear from the man
himself The you guys for watching I hope
