to you by goto meeting welcome back to
another episode of rumor roundup I'm not
Noah Kravitz he's on vacation trying to
learn how to join the rodeo I am jon
rettinger trying to fill into his size
12 shoes we got a lot to talk about
today we've got the samsung galaxy s3
we've got a new Mario title on the
horizon and we've got a nude nude and
we've got a new razor supposedly going
to be called the droid razr HD there is
not an apple rumor amongst us that's how
you know no is not hosting i'm jon
rettinger let's start the round up
keeping hearing a lot about the samsung
galaxy s3 for it seems like months now
this week on Monday Samsung finally
invited press to aim a third presumed
unveiling in London of the galaxy s3 one
of the more extreme rumours that we've
heard that they'll be support for
wireless charging while inductive
charging is anything new we just have to
look to the palm pre in the touchpad to
see examples of what wireless charging
can do seeing it reach mainstream and
sing and get that widespread adoption
that we expect the galaxy s3 to have is
very interesting South at wireless
charging is going to work it still
remains to be seen whether or not you
got to put it on a pad whether or not
you can plug in some sort of wireless
charging accessory and i'll charge
device within a certain radius which
kind of creeps me out a little bit it's
sort of yet to be seen but wireless
charging is supposed to be on board
creating also rumors of NFC so expect a
way to wirelessly pay for all that stuff
and all the accessories are going to
want to buy for your galaxy s three as
well and earlier this week boy genius
also reported that the galaxy s3 was
going to be the official phone of the
london olympics which is quickly coming
up so expect to hear a lot more about
the galaxy s3 as the weeks and months
continue and certainly on May third
TechnoBuffalo will be there bringing you
the latest so let's go ahead and go from
phone to the world of gaming and who's
more iconic than Mario we've got a Wii U
console coming sometime this year this
june's III is a perfect platform to
showcase the next Mario title and that's
exact
Hollywood miyamoto the head Nintendo
guru has said we're going to see now
there's been a lot of Mario titles
coming on it's no surprise that we're
going to see a new Mario title for the
Wii U but what is surprising that
Nintendo registered the URL Super Mario
for the guys remember super mario 3 was
the last numbered title that we see in
the Mario series we've had super mario
world we've had super mario galaxy one
and two we haven't had a true super
mario brothers since 3 which goes back
quite a while so now maybe we'll see a
Super Mario Brothers for finally grace
our shelves I'm hoping for a
side-scroller I loved playing new super
mario brothers wii i would love to see
sort of a better graphic classic super
mario brothers side scroller it's one of
things i'm most excited about the wii u
i did have a chance to check out the wii
u elves at CES kenway really impressed
the graphics prowess graphics wise it
looks like an xbox 360 or playstation 3
they are getting sort of current gen
graphics out of a next-gen console
certainly whatever Microsoft and Sony do
next sort surpassed in the graphics
department but Nintendo's never been on
the cutting edge of that but we are
finally getting true HD hopefully we'll
finally be getting downloadable content
and all the rest of that stuff that
you'd expect from a modern consulate
that we just hasn't delivered on
speaking of things that I like let's
talk about gotomeeting by citrix a
technobuffalo we've got staff all over
the country and all over the world and

to go to remember promo code techno
you're good to go I can also make word
dry so from phones two games back to
phones we've got rumors of a new razor
phone getting close to hitting the
market remember we had the original RAZR
that we had the droid razr maxx came out
just a few months later with a gigantic
battery now we've got rumors of the
droid razr HD and it's probably only a
few more months before we hear rumors of
the droid razr HD Maxx the even bigger
battery so the folks enjoyed life found
a Picasso gallery or some exif data in
there which sort of spilled the beans on
everything first it showed that droid
razr HD name is also referred to as the
Vanquish so whether or not that might be
just a code name or what we might see
when it comes to market is yet to be
seen so things are different in the
camera Department as well it's got an F
2.4 aperture which is similar what we
see in the iphone 4s a 13 megapixel
camera on board so presumably 1080p
video on hopefully pretty outstanding
stills should have ice cream sandwich
right out of the box as well so what do
you guys think are you excited about the
samsung galaxy s3 excited about a new
Mario title as excited as I am about a
new Mario title or are you waiting for
word ice cream sandwich pack and droid
razr HD this is rumor roundup I want to
