to you by goto meeting welcome back to
another episode of rumor roundup
I'm not Noah Kravitz he's on vacation
trying to learn how to join the rodeo I
am John Rhett injure trying to fill in
to his size 12 shoes we got a lot to
talk about today we've got the Samsung
Galaxy s3 we've got a new Mario title on
the horizon and we've got a nude nude
and we've got a new razor supposedly
going to be called the Droid Razr HD
there is not an Apple rumor amongst us
that's how you know Noah's not hosting
I'm John Rhett enger' let's start the
roundup we've been hearing a lot about
the Samsung Galaxy s3 for it seems like
months now this week on Monday Samsung
finally invited press to aim a third
presumed unveiling in London of the
galaxy s3 one of the more extreme rumors
that we've heard is that they'll be
support for wireless charging while
inductive charging is anything new we
just have to look to the Palm Pre and
the touchpad to see examples of what
wireless charging can do seeing it reach
mainstream and sing and get that
widespread adoption that we expect the
galaxy s3 to have is very interesting
how that wireless charging is gonna work
it still remains to be seen whether or
not you got to put it on a pad or not
you can plug in some sort of wireless
charging accessory and I'll charge
device within a certain radius which
kind of creeps me out a little bit it's
sort of yet to be seen but wireless
charging is supposed to be onboard
hearing also rumors of NFC so expect a
way to wirelessly pay for all that stuff
and all the accessories you're gonna
want to buy for your Galaxy s3 as well
and earlier this week Boy Genius also
reported that the galaxy s3 was going to
be the official form the London Olympics
which is quickly coming up so expect to
hear a lot more about the Galaxy s3 as
the weeks and months continue and
certainly on May 3rd TechnoBuffalo will
be there bringing you the latest so
let's go ahead and go from phone to the
world of gaming and who's more iconic
than Mario we've got a Wii U console
coming sometime this year this June's
III is a perfect platform to showcase
the next Mario title and that's exact
anyway Miyamoto the head Nintendo guru
has said we're going to see now there's
been a lot of Mario titles coming on
it's no surprise that we're gonna see a
new Mario title for the Wii U but what
is surprising that Nintendo registered
the URL Super Mario for the guys
remember Super Mario 3 was the last
numbered title that we see in the Mario
series we've had Super Mario World
we've had Super Mario Galaxy 1 and 2 we
haven't had a true Super Mario Brothers
since 3 which goes back quite a while so
now maybe we'll see a Super Mario
Brothers for finally grace our shells
I'm hoping for a side scroller I loved
playing New Super Mario Brothers we I
would love to see serve a better graphic
classic Super Mario Brothers side
scroller it's one of things I'm most
excited about the Wii U I did have a
chance to check out the Wii U while I
was at CES came away really impressed
the graphics prowess graphics wise it
looks like an Xbox 360 or Playstation 3
they are getting sort of current gen
graphics out of a next-gen console
certainly whatever Microsoft and Sony do
next
surpass in a graphics department but
Nintendo has never been on the cutting
edge of that but we are finally getting
true HD hopefully it will finally be
getting downloadable contents and all
the rest of that stuff that you'd expect
from a modern console app that we just
hasn't delivered on speaking of things
that I like let's talk about GoToMeeting
by Citrix TechnoBuffalo we've got staff
all over the country and all over the
world and we want to get together it's
hard to do it over a conference line the
folks at Citrix have a solution with
GoToMeeting is something that we use and
something that we love so if you your
office or your family and friends want a
way to communicate and collaborate while
being able to see each other's faces
GoToMeeting by Citrix it's gonna be an
awesome way to do it if you're not in
front of a computer to take advantage or
one of them newfangled iPads you can use
the iPad app to go ahead and check out
GoToMeeting to use the camera built

Drive so from phones to games back to
phones we've got rumors of a new razor
phone getting close to hitting the
market remember we had the original
razor that we had the Droid RAZR MAXX
came out a few months later with a
gigantic battery now we've got rumors of
the Droid Razr HD and it's probably only
a few more months before we hear rumors
of the Droid Razr HD max the even bigger
battery so the folks at joyed life found
a Picasso gallery some exif data in
there which sort of spilled the beans on
everything first it showed that droid
razr HD name it was also referred to as
the vanquish so whether or not that
might be just a codename or what we
might see when it comes to market is yet
to be seen so things are different in
the camera department as well it's got
an F 2.4 aperture which is similar what
we see in the iPhone 4s 13 megapixel
camera onboard so presumably 1080p video
on hopefully pretty outstanding stills
should have Ice Cream Sandwich right out
of the box as well so what do you guys
think are you excited about the Samsung
Galaxy s3 excited about a new mario
title as excited as I am about a new
Mario title or are you waiting for an
Ice Cream Sandwich packing droid razr HD
