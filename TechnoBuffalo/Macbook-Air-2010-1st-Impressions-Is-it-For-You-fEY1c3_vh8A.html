technobuffalo here and i want to talk
about the just rien on smack book airs
and sort of give you my thoughts and
impressions on it who I think these
computers are targeted for and more
importantly whether or not they're going
to be right for you so stick around so
the redesigned macbook air much like the
model replaces a very polarizing product
some love it some hate it and some may
be sort of in between so I want to go
ahead and run through the specs first
and talk about who these are targeting
so they're going to come in actually
four configurations to screen size
eleven point six and 13.3 let's start
with the newest form factor 11.6 inches
it features a 1.4 gigahertz core 2 duo
chip next one hundred dollars is going
to get you a 1.6 bigger its core 2 duo
chip come to two gigabytes ram you can
up that to four gigs for extra hundred
dollars which is actually relatively
reasonably priced considering apples
rammed the notoriously expensive so it's
finally nice to see Apple bring the
prices down to a reasonable expectations
the standard configuration for 999
didn't get you 64 gigabytes of flash
storage essentially what Apple did was
they took a standard a solid-state drive
that in a previous macbook air came I
believe a 2.5 inch container ticket out
of the container soldered it right to
the motherboard and that's going to give
you this new Insadong capability which
is not instant on from a cold boot but
from a deep hibernation and you can
upgrade that to 128 gigabytes if you
want to sort of jump to the next model
which is going to be one thousand one
hundred and ninety nine dollars and this
whole thing is going away two point
three pounds going to give you five
hours of supposedly actually use battery
life which is pretty long for a computer
that size now it gives you an extra USB
port to bring total to which sort of
addresses one of the major complaints
with the original macbook air it's got a
screen resolution extremely high
actually higher than the outgoing 13
inch models that replace of 1366 x 768
so really high res screen and they all
feature the nvidia geforce 320
em jumping up to the larger model the
13.3 you're going to get a 1.86
gigahertz processor standard 128
gigabytes of flash memory for 1299 you
can up the ram if you want four hundred
dollars you can also a processor four
hundred bucks at 2.13 and of course you
can go to the four gigs ram as i just
mentioned they try to sort of do all
that together and if 256 and a little
bit of faster processor 2.1 three
gigahertz it is going to cost you just
about 1,600 bucks so it is going to be a
little bit on the expensive side so who
is the macbook air for in this era of
chord ship so core i3 or i5 or i7 the
macbook air certainly doesn't keep pace
with the faster laptops on the market i
think really the sweet spot is that 11.6
inch model i'm just going to be ideal
for students and business travelers a
person thing i do a lot of traveling i
need my mac for video editing and i was
carrying around the macbook with me
which is certainly a part of a computer
but it's a little bit on the heavy side
i think something this small and
portable is really an ideal companion
for traveling specs for someone like me
who doesn't east amount of video ending
if you travel a lot for work i need
something that can edit video and you
can emulate a windows in you can use you
know parallels or do a native of boot
camp you now have a full power computer
in the 11.6 inch netbook size package
weighing very little and with stupendous
battery life so if you're wanting
something to take the class with you or
something to carry with you when you're
traveling it's a fantastic secondary
computer i don't think this is going to
serve you well as a primary computer i
certainly it does have a cord to do a
chip which will make it decently
powerfully nvidia graphics is going to
be unusable and it's going to sort of
take care of your regular graphics needs
but as an everyday powerhouse you're
going to sort of run into i think a
storage bottleneck as well sort of
maxing out 128 gigs on that 11 inch
model you can live within its
limitations however the macbook air may
serve you if all you're looking to do is
a regular email do some web browser
maybe check out some
youtube videos and play an occasional
light game like World of Warcraft on
some low settings Matt Berger actually
may be a pretty decent computer to bring
with you and it can power the full 27
inch apple cinema display right from
that little 11.6 inch screen on the 13.3
model is ups a little bit of power
certainly either model I definitely
recommend configuring them online and
getting the four gigs ram for a hundred
bucks that seems like a no-brainer to
really improve performance if you ever
want to run windows or virtualized that
having that extra ram you really can be
helpful running multiple programs doing
video it's really gonna help so if
you're looking to get a macbook air
either configuration get it online and
get the extra ram do that before you
upgrade the processor or do you want to
go 1.4 1.6 or ever you want to do really
go for the ramp first 13.3 i'm not
actually sure who that's targeting the
macbook air now is sort of teetering on
that netbook line entry point of a
thousand dollars 1100 after you upgrade
the RAM for five hundred dollars more
than a standard netbook but you're not
getting much more features than you
would get on a standard netbook my poor
usability then you get with an atom
processor so I think it's really going
to improve the longevity of the computer
where you might have to pick up a new
netbook after year and a half because
it's slow and isn't working especially
if you're trying to do a decent amount
of video watching our HD streaming the
macbook air is really going to serve you
13.3 inch if you're still a visit
traveler your students want something a
little bit larger it may be not a bad
option it's sort of now in a power line
with the entry-level macbook the white
plastic one certainly par for par
inspect respect it's very close it
certainly way is much much much less a
little bit smaller so sort of the short
when to answer here the macbook air get
a perfect for you if you are a business
traveler or a student or someone who
demands portability wherever you go
you're going to get a computer that's
going to be able to do all of your area
computer tasks including HD video
streaming you're going to look at the
limitations however you're not going to
have a optical drive so unless you want
to pick up an eighty dollar addition
you're going to sort of live within that
limitations and use
USB or ever else you want to do to get
your content i'm downloading it or
otherwise however that being said i'm
quite excited about the macbook air i
think it is a complete huge step forward
as far as design engineering and whether
or not you love apple or hate apple
there's no doubt that's going to sort of
drive the market forward and we'll see
competing products from Dell HP and the
like that are utilizing some of these
new engineering techniques like actually
taking the flash out of the container
put it right on the motherboard so we're
going to see sort of a new wave of
ultra-thin actually powerful computers
so I'm excited about it what about you
you agree/disagree you excited about the
macbook air not excited about the
macbook air early one hear what you guys
have to say I am jon rettinger from
TechnoBuffalo and i'll see you guys in
the next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
