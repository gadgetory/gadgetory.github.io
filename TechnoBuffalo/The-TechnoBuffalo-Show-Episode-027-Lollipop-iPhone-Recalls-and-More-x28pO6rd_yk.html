episode of the TechnoBuffalo show I'm
I'm your to host for today Sean ani
editor and chief to the site and i'm
joined by executive editor mobile Todd
Hazleton everybody are you doing today
Todd I am good yo on news came out this
week luckily it's not the onslaught of
devices that last week was I that was
daddy how many devices were coming in
and now we can finally talking about the
nexus 9 we can't happen right here yes
so I have not gotten to touch one yet I
have not played with lollipop yet and as
we always state this is does not
constitute our review what do you think
of lollipop so far I really really like
lollipop so far I can show you a little
bit of it here I like how much flatter
everything is and and I've said this to
like in our post that they're small like
animations as you go about so you tap
like the home button it kind of like
ripple effects I like just small touches
here in the quick settings menu there's
I don't know if you guys can see it but
there's a quick or a small avatar for me
you know it's a custom picture just like
all these small touches throughout i
spiked to the side and there's a huge
you know Google now page which we've had
before and I just really like if I feel
like it was just really polished
everywhere we can went through and
really line it up and I remember when I
mean I'm going all the way back to
Honeycomb but it it felt like Tron and
it was like blue but like nothing really
matched this is like finally like it's
finally to the point where everything
sort of works together really well my
first CES was the the honeycomb year and
yeah that's when you the motorola xoom
and all that was there yeah it's free
and it just it looked like a 1980s
nightmare mm-hmm and performed one like
12 I mean that's another thing so we can
talk about we're still working on our
review so I'm not making like any final
claims here but there are some parts of
this that
the nexus not that I'm not crazy about
so like it has a Tegra k1 processor
which is super super powerful we saw
that in the the shield tablet from
Nvidia and it's capable of running some
desk top quality games and especially
then you can like add a controller all
this fun stuff will like Google is not
showing any of that here there aren't
any special games that are taking
advantage of that processor and I just
feel like even the games that are on
here kind of like you're in their
sluggish and Google release a software
update that was supposed to fix that but
still like I feel like performance isn't
isn't crazy here and to me this very
much feels like in a lot of ways a
reference design which is what it you
know and some some cases supposed to be
as a Nexus device excuse me while I mute
my phone so yeah I don't know I so do
you feel like maybe it's lollipop that's
the issue or is it the Nexus 9 I don't
think it's lollipop but that's a good
question right because the Tegra k1 we
know it runs really smooth and and
actually will know better soon because
lollipops can hit the shield tablet this
month nvidia said last night but that's
a good point yeah i don't think it's
lollipop lollipop feels smooth itself is
just like this underlying i'm sure it's
it can be fixed with a software update
again but like i just feel like um and i
think i saw this in other comments to
like when apple takes the stage it
introduces a new ipad i'm not saying
apples you know the way to do things or
anything but what they do is they show
what this new ipad can do with this
processor and like I feel like Google's
not doing that in the case with the
Nexus 9 here like it's not saying like
check out all this stuff it can do
because I know it can do it we've
already seen it done on the shield
tablet so like why not highlight more of
that power and I don't know what the
answer is how to do that but it should
be you know happening excuse my typing
everyone Rory Troy managing editor of
techno Buffaloes on vacation and he just
imed me about work stuff and I was like
uh go to vacation eat things hey you're
not here look like last year when I
called in to the weekly staff call from
medication has
I just did that to screw with everybody
but I'm always watching I don't know
it's gonna be interesting especially
like when we see lollipop roll out to
say like the nexus 7 to see how it
performs Nexus 5 any of the previous
generation devices that we know are
going to get a pure Android version one
fine right too because I have the nexus
5 floating around here one of these
drawers with the latest Android L build
on it and that's been you know totally
fine for me so I don't I I did I still
have not got an official email
confirmation but I did jump into that a
sale that they were having yesterday at
HTC for though yeah that was a great
fire sale yeah which I don't know if
that was the wise I mean you do it a day
after the device comes out enough people
were like oh crap which we know what I
feel like I think it was great promotion
they're like hey come in by it you know
they didn't have an unlimited supply so
wasn't like everybody come by our half
off tablet you know bubbly I would have
felt terrible like if i bought the
device in the next day they were just
offering it to everybody for half off i
would be crazy but right now sasha mahal
has a question we very answered part of
it what do you guys think of android 5.1
papa is there any features that you feel
is missing again you you can speak to
have more than I can um I really like it
I feel like it's the smartest version of
Android obviously it has the most
changes i'm still using it i'm still
learning some of the new stuff in it but
i think one of my favorite things is
just material design the way it looks
and the way google's new apps are being
updated to look that way to so like we
saw google calendar which is incredible
the new google calendar if you haven't
seen it yet install it's really
beautiful has like different pictures
for the month and if you have a flight
coming up it shows you know the weather
and the an actual picture of your
destination so if you're fine in New
York you'll see a picture of New York
it's really cool and I think that's what
I like about it just all comes together
and it feels like I've said before feel
so alive that's what I like
just in case you forgot where you're
flying to write it fly to New York
because I'm here what no but it's cool
it's just like what's more robust and
alive you know I don't know that's how I
feel about it quick funny story I flew
in from Japan once into LAX and of
course I'm tired as all get out and the
the first customs guy who checks my
passport he hands it to me it just
mumbles welcome to Miami oh I get like a
foot and a half way I'm like that was
really mean every swimmer grinned at me
I'm like oh it took a second for it to
click I like I'm in it I'm in LA what
that's hilarious yeah after a long haul
flight yo your brain is not all there
but so so yesterday we had the rumor of
the iphone 6 plus being possibly
recalled over its flash memory yeah so
that was crazy you know I this was
something that came up in the toy
industry a lot when I worked in any time
there was a problem as a toy a lot of
people would meet oh they're going to be
caught they're going to recall it and I
one time i called up i can't remember
what toy company was I was like yo hey
guys we're here in this rumor that you
know there's going to be a recall and
they were like Shawn you go do you have
any clue how much a recall costs yeah
it's obscene they go unless it is
killing somebody we're not recalling
yeah exactly I in this case I I mean if
any of this proves to be true which we
saw a report later in the day that it
looks like it's not but if this was true
I think it would just be simply a bring
it to the apple store and we'll swap out
the part or but an actual true recall
yeah like a huge massive recall which is
what this report suggested was in store
that was crazy yeah but I mean ok so the
root of it though is that apparently
like for those who didn't see the news
yesterday
apparently the iphone 6 plus with 128
gigs of storage I think the iphone 6 to
the report didn't refer specifically to
the six just at six plus uses a
different type of NAND flash storage
that I guess is susceptible to crashing
and has one of the IC controller parts I
guess is apparently allegedly a default
or faulty in some cases and that's
already been seen in some of Samsung's
solid-state drives so they were
surmising than that there they'd heard
through the grapevine I guess in the
industry sources that Apple was planning
to recall the iphone 6 plus because of
this now what's the main issue I've seen
it myself apparently when you have a lot
of apps installed on your iphone 6 plus
with 128 gigs of storage it crashes a
lot and reboots mine does probably about
once a day and so if that's causing it
then I can understand why this would be
a problem to the point where like like
I've Apple said bring it to the store
and we'll swap it out for you know that
doesn't do that I didn't heartbeat so
you know so there's there's two sides
this rumor is it happening yes is it as
major as there is it you know as it
needs to be and is there going to be a
huge recall and is everybody getting go
nuts I don't think that's going to be
the case I mean there's gonna be a huge
recall on this thing I think we would
have heard that with the Dean of Ben
gate stuff yeah exactly you know and my
question would be who needs that many
apps yeah well I mean I I was talking
with Brandon on the on our team
yesterday because we were going through
and sang like well who has who's seen
this problem and stuff and I was like
well I have and he's like how many apps
you have and I went through and 104 I
counted so I guess I do have that many
apps I I probably have around 80 or so
but I mean we I've seen reports of like
it has to be like 500 app so I'm like uh
I don't know my line crash is pretty
regularly to be honest but I mean it's
just like it's real quick just like flat
flashes to the apple logo and restarts i
also like pictures and videos and stuff
too so it's my storage pre-crime i I
have a lot of it
he owes actually I'll while we're
talking here I'll look up how much space
I have left but I haven't seen any
issues hmm yeah so I I have no idea
let's see i have 30 gigs available on my
64 gig right okay but who knows I I
don't think there's gonna be recall I
think I think people are looking for
issues with their iphones yeah and then
we talked about this yesterday how in
Korea I guess the media can sometimes be
swayed by different companies and you
know there's two big ones there where
they'll sort of report things that might
not always be true and to me and let put
on your conspiracy theory happy what I
was thinking what if one of apple's new
jersey i want to get some tin foil yeah
what if I mean but this is this is I
guess it could happen what if one of
apple's major smartphone phone
competitors sort of said this and said
oh there might be a massive recall you
know i whispered it to somebody and then
all of a sudden here you go and apples
you know getting bad press about this
recall so who knows you know what the
roots of it are but you never know you
never know I mean it's an issue that is
happening so um something we didn't
discuss a pre-show and looking at my
apps made me think of it what do you
think about this amazon prime unlimited
photo storage yeah I was cool I started
uploading my photos yesterday the
problem for me is now there's just so
many so many options like okay so with
an iphone you have icloud right and it's
already backing up but i also have used
android so those photos are also being
packed up to Google Plus which is great
i love google plus photos i love the
auto uh what is it awesome auto awesome
feature you know it'll animator add in
something funny um but then i also have
one drive storage because i subscribed
now to office 365 so I know Microsoft
just opted to unlimited but I still see
a terabyte which is more than enough for
me and now Amazon
and that's on top of like my dropbox
account to so like i don't know that i
need it but it's great for people who
don't already have five other options
exactly well aim with me i have i use a
system called sugarsync which right hey
yeah i love sugarsync because no man
install it on multiple computers and
them make sure your folders are already
always you know the same on every
computer but then I have you know a
flickr pro account which I'm really
beginning to wonder why there's any
reason to have flickr and when there's
so many way if you want to show you
pictures off that's one thing but i was
using it's kind of a backup system
uh-huh and i actually had a picture
though one of my pictures from Boston of
a graveyard ended up in us textbook what
yeah I got an email from a textbook
publisher and they're like hey we saw
your picture on flickr and we'd like
your permission to use it in our
textbook I'm like sure that's lost but
yeah so I was like okay maybe i will
keep flickr and see how many more text
books i can get in but it i think that
is the issue there are so many cloud
options and the biggest issue I have is
trying to remember which cloud I put
that file on yeah between like Google
Drive and Dropbox you know I'm like oh I
put that one on weight it was on oh yeah
yeah and Dropbox has that carousel
feature which is specifically for photos
too so it's like everybody has something
I feel like I prefer mine to go to
Google Plus because they looked better
there it's I just like the layout better
it does all that cool effects like I was
saying and then um I also backup to
onedrive because for me that's sort of
like my photo dump like but it's
terribly organized onedrive looks really
ugly to me I just don't like any
anything about it aside from like okay
my photos are a year and I don't have to
worry
the one thing I still need to figure out
Prime photos and I sought an example of
a screenshot is how to buy everything
right now is organized by year I'd like
to organize okay yo that was my trip to
bus and that was my trip to Philadelphia
right yeah and I am very calm yeah but
I've had like you know 30 seconds to
really play with the sucker yeah I have
it all i did was start uploading it on
my mac yesterday my photos yeah i
uploaded like three thousand pictures
yesterday or something like that which
I'm like when did I start shooting this
many pictures yeah well you know what
other fear about all these services is
like what happens when I just forget
about it am i okay you know this is
great but I'm just not using it so I'm
just like my problem is that I leave
these photos just out there in the ether
like my private family photos and that's
scary like I remember when I was in
college what was one who was it webshots
or something was like a popular mom in
photo like before Facebook had photo
albums and so I would use that in like
after college I remember going back
being like oh my I totally forgot these
are out there you know and well I
started a long time ago about every six
months I print out a spreadsheet for my
family and I hope they never have to use
it but should anything ever happen to me
you know car accident whatever they have
a spreadsheet that has all my accounts
all my user names passwords and also
tells them what's on that account and if
it's got a sore recurring payment on it
oh nice so that way if they you know
should something happen to me you know
they aren't paying for like my personal
server for three months and they don't
know what why that charge is coming
through or what it is hmm you know so
I've it's also helpful to me because it
helps remind me you know what I've put
where right but if I know I'm the
oddball I know that ninety-nine point
nine nine percent of people are not
keeping that sort of record and you're
right i mean there's going to be this
gigantic digital trail
behind us as we all move from service to
service yeah exactly and they don't
float there yeah exactly so I mean heck
I think I still have a myspace account i
haven't been on it and got your nothing
what was that screaming it was I don't
know well there was one site i worked
for years ago that it was just as social
media was booming and we actually had a
company rule that we had to join every
social network well the thing was we
were always afraid that people were
going to try to come in and personate us
I have as far as i know i still have a
bebo account I had an orchid account I I
had memberships I had I I had joined
sites you've never even heard of anyone
oh it was insanity insanity but let's
start getting into some of the questions
we've got coming in here we've got one
from charles van ness do you think the
next iPhone will have two gigabytes of
RAM like the ipad air 2 has probably
yeah it seems probable but you know we
stuck with one gig this year I think it
just depends on what Apple plans to do
with iOS and if it requires that much
yeah your apples never been one to bend
to the the whole spec race yeah you know
so they're they're not gonna up it but
it is going to start looking odder and
odder if they're you know back there at
one gigabyte and feel four gigabytes has
become the standard yeah at some point
they're going to have to up at just so
although a that's the one thing Apple
never published sizes how much Raymond
has yes we've done in like tear downs
yeah that always comes out of the tear
downs you know if you if you look over
apple site they have never published a
ram for the iPads or the iphones and
then sometimes they say things like
quarter terabyte
oh but that was before I ghosts better
this is a new imac I i think it was most
it wasn't the rat know and i know that
but i think it was comes with a quarter
terabyte of storage oh I remember we
were all on the family call area on the
group called we were all like did he
just say quarter terrible scourge
everything uh yeah I want you to use
that all your life okay so I'm changing
topics here but galaxy s galaxy s6 rumor
yesterday said that it might be up 128
gigs of storage and if micro SD card
support is there and you could have a
quarter terabyte there you go oh
goodness gracious also from charles van
ness have you heard about the
exclusivity with mcx will expire in a
few months not years yeah so I said it
was such a mess yeah I you know us I
mean we've heard so many conflicting
things about mcx and even some of that
conflict comes from official statements
from the company right I it's I say at
this point I don't know what's happening
I I think that if mcx does what you know
we've heard that only ties into your
bank account it doesn't use credit cards
which that's just a way for the
retailers to save the credit card fees
this thing's not going to take off no
one's going to want to just give direct
access to their bank accounts yeah
indeed collection stuff like that I mean
I don't know I feel like I wish we could
just stick with what we have but it
sounds like this has been years in the
making and you know they obviously want
it for a reason and I'm sure they think
it's the better option but you know
having use google wallet and an Apple
pay and soft card I think that's sort of
it's just more seamless like I don't
want to deal with the QR code and
indirect and excess yeah Thank accounts
and stuff like that so
totally agree but early the mcx thinks
otherwise and they say are you know our
customers know what they want and this
is what they want so we'll see but you
know as a consumer myself I don't think
I agree with that uh let's get to this
card I poor Sasha bahal has been asking
this for like two to three weeks now do
you guys have any favorite pebble apps
and watch faces um I don't have my
pebble on right now I'm using the g
watch our which is cool um no mine just
had like my favorite one on pebble I
forget what it was called but it had
like the barometer readings like it had
like every weather reading like wind
direction wind speed not thought that
was my favorite it's pretty easy to find
think it's highly rated so I've got a my
watch face is called Trekkie and it
looks like the computer displays on the
the next generation enterprise nice and
so yeah because I'm a giant geek uh as
for apps I really don't use a whole lot
of apps on the pebble I i mainly use it
for notifications yeah that's all that's
actually all I used mine for two I mean
I had like ESPN on there then I took it
off because the worst is like when I
couldn't watch a game and that's why I
was recording it at home within this
course or coming in on my wrist I'm like
no no I see I'm one of those horrible
people I look at the score before I
watch a record game because I'm like but
do I really feel like being annoyed but
not for me there's always to hold out
the hope that they won though and then
yeah but like I can sit down watch an
error and a half of Manchester United
get yo embarrassed or I can do something
oh yeah good point I hate to do that but
yeah it's just sometimes you have to
make those guesses yeah okay from Soho
Raja I hope I said that correctly I have
a moto g 2014 when will I get android l
well android 5.0
lollipop is the official name now uh
what Motorola say I think it was like a
they already listed definitely coming
let me just bring it up I'll give you
have it in my history here I'll give you
direct answer but I know it should
probably be quick because Google or
motorola was really good with that last
year with the Moto X I mean in some
cases Pete other what was I guess the
google play edition devices to to KitKat
so we should see it on let's the exact
timing for the rollouts wasn't revealed
yet but it will reveal it later so I
don't know I wouldn't let's see HTC is
promising within 90 days and Motorola
was really really quick last year so i
would say at least before februari
definitely so that the 90 days that's
HTC didn't motorola quicker um I don't
you know I don't know a firm date but
sooner than later would be my guess yeah
yeah I I don't think it's gonna be very
long if it seems like a lot of these
phone makers are ready to go this time
around like we saw the leaves and galaxy
s5 samsung tease the galaxy note 4 a
lollipop update sony already had a list
of phones that it's promising so you
know hopefully it's quick for everybody
yeah from charles band knows what do you
think about christian bale possibly
playing steve jobs in the movie he
actually has dropped out yeah the new
rumors michael fassbender bail did not
feel that they well the official word is
that he didn't feel he was the right
person and he stepped out of the role
but you never know oh it's the rumor
then do we have any rumors on why he
look well they're there same Michael
Fassbender who plays magneto in the
x-men movies young Magneto and also
played the Android David in prometheus
but the sad thing is bail looked a lot
like job spots yeah hey I don't know
we'll see Christian Bale is known to be
a little high editor yeah oh just a tiny
bit high just teeny tiny bit I'm
sure we've all heard that famous audio
yeah no no Oh Christian what that man
sins uh-uh from Sascha Mahal hey sean
how is the new irvine office in oregon
office is really really nice I liked it
a lot a lot more open much bigger
fantastic having a studio now we have a
lot of room for expansion you know John
was like well I think we go we can fit
and he told me a number of people we can
fit in here I was like no I don't want
to manage that many people know maybe
someday we'll see but no it's really
nice and there will be an officer or
coming once they get a little bit more
set up and settled some new string this
podcast real quick good the moto max is
officially the droid turbo for
international release just so everybody
knows you're listening right now awesome
uh from last II hello google said that
they would roll out the lollipop update
on 3rd November and it's almost six
November and still no update when will
the and 5 get the update that's slow I
saw unfortunately I saw a lot of sites
with this news yesterday or two days ago
um what happened was they said roll out
Android and what Google meant was like
Nexus 9 rolling out android like it's
going and then they also start to
release the final builds to manufacture
so that they can get their updates
prepared so it's not the final release
of lollipop for the nexus 5 a nexus 7
and all these devices right then but but
I know that's sort of it was
misconstrued all over the Internet no
because there were files going up but
they aren't files their files that you
know like so HTC can work on it you know
with the 90-day leave right to get it to
release out so hopefully soon I mean it
shouldn't take long right these are
Nexus devices it shouldn't be very long
but there's no like official November
update roll out now the wording was a
little weird and a lot of sites did
report it as November thermit it's
that's when it's gone out to the people
it needs to go out to and the Nexus
devices i would say within the next week
or two will get it yes that's a guess
just to be clear that's a guess okay
from mike beard and now the note 4 is
out what smartphone do you think is
killing the rest and all I could picture
is a cell phone with a big butcher knife
and like wearing a hockey mask me know
we're great I have it right here I
really like it um i don't i don't think
anyways like killing each other right no
no no I don't think so I mean Nexus 6
looks awesome there's a lot of awesome
phones right now I I would hate to be in
the market for a phone right now it's
nuts i I don't know how I would ever
decide you know I yeah I I I kinda did
make a decision over the summer I I did
you know i purchased a one plus one and
i also purchased an iphone 6 plus but if
i was out there right now just your
general consumer walking into a carrier
store i think my eyes would bug out of
my head right yeah there's so many think
it's good that they're all really good
um I was like writing now I would look
at like me personally I would probably
look at the note 4 and the Nexus 6
because I know that the m8 will probably
be updated around early next year it's
my guess for HTC and Sony's Xperia z3 is
out but here in the United States it's
only technically really on tmobile which
is another one good one I mean I would
totally check that out too and what else
do we have out there I mean one post one
of you can grab one I bought one of
those it's really nice too but I think
me I would probably go with the Nexus 6
right now this is pure Android I really
like lollipop it's already on there just
expensive
exactly um interesting question from
sahaja do you think the ipad mini will
be killed off and the reason i want to
address this is this whole idea you know
why didn't they do a smaller Nexus
tablet this time I'm wondering if maybe
we are finally seeing the phablet's eat
into the 7-inch market it seems
plausible and especially I mean I
thought there was a rumor that the ipad
the rumored ipad bro is going to kill
off the ipad mini and the reason that i
thought that meets sense is because the
ipad mini well we know ipad sales are
down quarter-over-quarter anyway and so
if Apple was trying to spur you interest
in the iPads well then maybe a new form
factors the way to do that say like this
is it does anything look that you can do
and maybe you can run two apps
side-by-side and releasing a new iPad
Mini he's not introducing anything new
right like in fact this year the iPad
Mini 3 has the same parts as last year
but with touch ID which tells me and you
you know better Sean but it seems like
they're just trying to read inventory of
what they have already on board for the
ipad mini and yeah maybe to get rid of
it yeah it was very very interesting to
me this year that they really the only
update to the ipad mini was the touch ID
right yeah that that seemed very very
odd me you know now true in the life
cycle of the main ipad there have been
the few minut updates i I think we all
remember that one where we were like
wait did they just announced a new iPad
yeah this ad like lightning port or
something yeah and we were all what the
heck they just after day pass you know
so yeah I don't know I I find it very
interesting that the the nexus 7 did not
get an update and that we went to a
nexus 9 I that the ipad mini didn't get
a major update I mean obviously amazon
still thinks this is
a viable I mean my goodness they
released a fire HDX six yeah see that's
crazy I still don't get the six um but i
don't know i will the ipad mini ever be
killed off possibly i don't think it's
gonna be as quick as people like suggest
i think maybe after like another year I
mean they're not just gonna release the
ipad mini 3d icon are mine yeah exactly
exactly ah let's see here for Mike beard
when google says they will send you an
invite for inbox how long does it
usually take I request of 10 days ago
and still no invite that's a mystery I
think mine came in like two days and
yeah you know I didn't use a presa
canario use my own private account uh I
don't know I guess it is a mystery best
bets probably to ask for invites for
people that already have it I got three
early i gave it to technobuffalo staff
and i think they've refilled me recently
and I gave it to other friends so I mean
uh uh it should be public pretty soon
too yeah yeah I I think so as well oh
let's see from charles van ness have
either of you seen or have thoughts
about the new 5k imac looking at getting
one just wanted your thoughts neat i I
know I haven't been your head okay yeah
John has one out in irvine but how did I
not seen it he said it's pretty looks
like people love that thing and I mean
5k you know why not but did you see the
picture of the burj posted of their site
yeah i sent that to you oh that's right
yeah i think that's like your native
resolutions like it's like this big on
the screen yeah amazing how small it
actually looked uh interesting question
from liza ste why do i why people say
that the nexus 6 is too expensive but
they own an iphone 6 yeah that's a good
point i mean i take that I'm putting my
foot in my mouth when I say too
expensive
I just mean that it's not as affordable
as nexus devices were in the past and so
at 699 with 64 gigs of storage which is
the one I'd want it's just expensive
right now off contract I know it's going
to hit all the carriers it sounds like
for about 1 99 in which case no it's not
too expensive in fact it's really nicely
priced in at 699 it's even really solid
price compared to flagships that are
upwards of you know eight hundred
dollars i mean i think the galaxy note
edge is gonna cost 399 with a contract
like that's insane I off condo is for
the edge blew my mind yeah yeah what is
it nine something signed 49 yeah so good
point there i'm just saying too
expensive in the sense that yeah you
know for me looking at the nexus 5 price
moving to the nexus 6 i don't think it's
you Spencer it's a great phone too so
yeah I know I think we are all just it
was it's bit it was more expensive than
were used to with Nexus devices I think
that was the issue there but you know it
more power to you if you pick one up
because I would love to pick one up I
just unfortunately not in my budget
right now at me too let's see here going
through uh this one we get every so
often from sasha hall also what happened
with john quach John decided he want to
focus more on just development like app
development and he left to go work for a
company to do that it was we miss him
greatly and I think I try to talk to him
every couple days nice yeah well he and
I have some running jokes I just have to
keep going and and torture him with but
that junk watch is doing well and we
miss him and we wish them all the luck
in the world uh let's see you're a good
question from Anna MacDonald does the
fact i have the gpe google play edition
HTC One m8 mean I will get the new
android sooner hopefully right
yeah that's sort of like the point what
I don't know I mean here's the thing
because you have GPE and it's not going
to have to go through carrier approvals
then yes I mean you should be getting
the update sooner than folks who have to
wait for verizon or sprint or t-mobile
or AT&amp;amp;T to say okay it's good to go you
can push it up now so hopefully yeah
yeah I i would think you will but you
never know for sure from sasha mahal are
you ever going to have any of the guys
at the irvine office on the technical
buffalo show we hope to the problem is
that when the time we decided to do the
show it's nine a.m. pacific so they're
just getting the office and trying to
get their day started so we hope to work
it out at some point but we just haven't
gotten there yet yeah a maps update for
everybody out there there's so much news
happening right now okay uh let's see
here from nate mark quiz can't decide
between the note for the nexus 6 which
do you think will be better all-around
experience i want to buy outright and an
unsure if the note 4 is worth an extra
fifty to one hundred dollars very good
question oh man that's tough because s10
is really cool and it does a lot of
stuff and the note 4 is really it's
really beautiful phone i love the metal
edges i love everything about it it
doesn't feel as quick and fluid as
lollipop on the nexus 6 but you know
that sort of been the trend Samsung's
devices haven't been that quick of fluid
for a while now it's just touch ways but
if you can if you can you know sort of
overlook that and you really like the S
Pen then note for is fantastic device
but if you want pure Android you know
look at the Nexus 6 i'd say try to wait
maybe a little bit until nexus 6 hits a
carrier store where you can then play
with them side by side and get a better
fuel because you're really gonna want
either both really really nice phones in
the hand and everything so yeah yeah
exactly so yeah that excellent question
and tough call but i agree Todd you
really need to pick up a nexus 6 and see
how you think it feels uh let's see here
from Sascha Mahal how come it was
basically impossible to get a pre or to
preorder a nexus 6 limited stock
quantity would be my guess yeah it
sounds like you but they said they're
gonna refill yesterday I guess they said
they're gonna refill every Wednesday
yeah at some point today you can try the
order again and probably it'll probably
run out stock really quickly again as I
dribble coffee down my shirt uh-uh yeah
this whole my lip it's always been a
curse but that this is actually why I
always when I travel no matter what I
always carry an extra shirt in my
carry-on mmm even if I'm just taking my
computer bag there's an extra t-shirt or
something in that I know wedding last
weekend and I wore a white shirt and I
brought an extra white shirt with me in
my bag just yeah cuz me putting on a
white shirt is just an immediate call
for everything yeah to attack me oh good
lord ah let's see here from Sasha Mahal
what do you guys think of the first
person mode coming to GTA 5 and are any
going to get it I'm cool I'm gonna be
looks really awesome I I'm picking it up
for the xbox one just because I played
the original version on the 360 I know
it doesn't really matter but I i will
say i'm annoyed by the fact I guy go
through the whole story mode again see I
didn't get very far because my xbox 360
was on its way out I had to like slap
the console every time I put the game in
and I eventually I was like I'm not
dealing with this thing anymore so I'm
kind of excited then I saw a
first-person mode yesterday I was like
whoa this looks amazing and we doing on
the ps4 there's gonna be some times
where first person will be awesome and
there's gonna be other times are like ah
no way yeah i like when in the video
yesterday when he was swerving between
the police cars i was like oh no no no
no no no that will all be third person
thank you for me well obviously in like
that'll field three and stuff flying
helicopters
and that kind of stuff first person can
be pretty useful yeah yeah one last
question here asking if Joey will make a
return to the TechnoBuffalo show that is
the plan the gaming department has a
list of reviews they're working on as a
mile long and something a lot of people
don't think of as if a campaign is 40
hours that means those guys are spending
literally 40 hours why a before they
start reviewing so you can see quickly
how their time is massively consumed so
the hope is that he will return in the
new year it's just a matter of there's
just way too many reviews going on and
next week's a big game released week and
the week after that's a big game
released week so until this big release
windows over that's he's going to be
m.i.a for sure well folks that is going
