TechnoBuffalo with my unboxing of the
2012 mac mini what you know has been out
for a few weeks now but this is a custom
built to order quad core model with a
one terabyte fusion drive so let's go
and find out what comes in the box and
exactly how fast that fusion drive is so
on the front of the box we have the mac
mini text and the little guy hanging out
down below and it's actually about the
size of this box on the flip side that
give us a little overview of the ins and
the outs but I'm gonna give you guys a
close-up look and actually give you a
real tour of that so we can go and skip
that for now so we'll go to flip the box
back over so we can begin the unboxing
by sliding out the mac mini like soap
we're going to lift from the little tab
right here and then we're going to set
the mac mini to the side just for a
second as we go through the accessories
first up we have a quick start guide
which kindly says hello then we have
some documentation on the Mac Mini
itself and that of course it would not
be an apple unboxing without those apple
stickers beyond that we have an hdmi to
DVI adapter which is cool of Apple to
include because you know as well as I do
they will gouge you any chance they get
with an adapter cable lastly we have a
power cable and that wraps up the
accessory so we can go to unwrap the Mac
Mini and take a closer look so you guys
can see it's got a nice brushed aluminum
finish doesn't take up a whole lot of
space it's very compact we got the apple
logo up towards the top and giving you
guys a closer look at the ins and the
outs will go to start to Alex with the
physical power button and then right
next to that we have the actual power
input followed by the Ethernet port we
then have a firewire 800 port HDMI out a
Thunderbolt port for USB 3.0 an SD card
slot and an audio in as well as out now
like I said this is the quad core model
so here is an initial geekbench score
you can see it does perform quite well
it actually does beat out some of the
older Mac Pro's again this is equipped
with a fusion drive which takes the
speed and performance of a solid-state
drive and combines it with the lower
cost capacity of a traditional hard disk
drive now even though these are
physically two separate drives you guys
can see it does come up as one volume in
the mac OS profile tab as far as speeds
go you can see it does operate really
really quick with read speeds over 400
megabytes per second and write speeds
topping over 300 megabytes per second to
give
an idea of how that actually affects you
in terms of a real world test I'm going
to duplicate a 4 gigabyte file and you
guys can see exactly how much faster the
fusion drive is that a standard 5400 RPM
hard disk drive so I'm going to go an
interrupt right here and stop it not
make you guys sit through the entire
thing you can see the actual hard drive
had quite a ways to go where as a fusion
drive finish it up very very fast I know
a lot of people will mistakenly compared
to a traditional SSD cache and drive
like a seagate momentus or something
like Intel Smart Response technology but
those actually operate in terms of hard
drive first SSD second whereas the
fusion drive tries to do everything
first through the SSD and then
intelligently moves things that you
don't use to the hard drive and then
things you do back to the SSD so thank
you guys very much for watching this
video hopefully it gave a little clarity
to those of you interested in the fusion
drive make sure to check out
TechnoBuffalo calm for the latest and
greatest tech content this is John M or
John for bulls sign it out I will see
you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
