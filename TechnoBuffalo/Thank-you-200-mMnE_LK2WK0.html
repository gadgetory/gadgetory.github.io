true hybrid video and I started looking
back at all my videos and tell where I
started where I am now where I want to
go maybe a little bit nostalgic so
instead of doing some sort of funny like
you're trying to do for the hundred
video i just wanted to speak to you just
for a few minutes directly from the
heart guys thank you you'd given me an
opportunity to talk about and do
something that I love technology is my
passion and really because of your
support I'm able to talk about it and
share my views with the world and I just
couldn't do anything without you you
guys give me an audience and by giving
me an audience you're also my motivation
sounds kind of corny would also need my
inspiration to cope with new ideas and
try to find avenues for getting new
products and new things to review and
just a nice way to talk to you guys and
I really just want to say thank you
that's all I feel like you guys kind of
all become a little silly but almost
like all my friends and I read all the
comments I read all the emails and it
really just makes me happy to know that
I've got a lot of friends all over the
world so thank you very much for your
support and I'm really looking forward
to the next 200 videos kind of where we
take it from there a lot of exciting
things coming out the next few weeks I
got some contest brewing some giveaways
coming up to a lot of cool things so
please guys stick around and stay tuned
and for some exclusive content and some
sneak preview of what might be coming
here follow me on twitter at twitter.com
/ john for lakers i'll see you guys the
next video bye and thank you again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
