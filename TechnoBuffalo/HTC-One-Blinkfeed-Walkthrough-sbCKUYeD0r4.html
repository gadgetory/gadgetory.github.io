TechnoBuffalo I'm here with the HTC One
and I wanted to bring you some of the
highlights features of the device
because we've covered it we haven't
really go really deep into it yet to see
you know what it's about and one of the
unique features is that the home screen
is now live and they call this clink
feed and i'll show you how it works it's
very similar to Flipboard we go through
and say you want to read this story
these are all in spanish so you want to
read that story pops it up and hopefully
we load it but it'll load this story try
a different one we're stuck on their
connection here so whatever works works
so in any case you'd have the full story
here that you can scroll her and then if
you want to read more from the news
source you can tap the name it'll bring
up other headlines from that same source
now we can go back and say well click
this and we go in here oh here's a full
story so a load at that time then of
course you have the option to share is
to various things if you think its
unique story thing but the cool thing is
is that this is constantly updating on
your home screen so you know at one
point in the day this story might be
here but later on it might switch to
something else entirely and let me see
if there's a settings control I'm not
sure it's going to let us dig too deep
into these demo devices but there are
more than I believe 1400 different feeds
you can choose from for that blinkfeed
so if you want to focus on tech days you
can just have tech nodes there you can
have all kinds of stuff oh here we go
here are the sources you can choose from
so also social networks Facebook etc so
these are the highlight ones we can
choose here
but there are more than 1,400 I believe
as I've said from HTC so in any case
that's a quick look here at blinkfeed on
the HTC One and they told us to that if
you don't really like that you can
always come back to this normal home
screen and set this one is the default
but we're really excited for putting
food I think it's going to be awesome
and of course you have the the weather
widget that we all love from HTC up top
and its redesigned this Todd is it's in
with technobuffalo</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
