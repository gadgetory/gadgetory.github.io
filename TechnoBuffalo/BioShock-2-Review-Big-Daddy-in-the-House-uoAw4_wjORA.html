welcome back for yet another very
exciting game review this time we're
looking at a sequel to one of my
favorite first-person shooters Bioshock
I went and got the ps3 version of the
game mainly because I got a cheap deal
out of a gamestop trade offer so that's
what we're going to be looking at they
tried to sell me the special deluxe
edition of the game with a vinyl of the
first game soundtrack and a bunch of
other crap but I decided that the game
is going to have to stand on its own two
legs before I buy into the merchandise
three years ago in 2007 producer Kevin
Levine and 2k Boston team introduced a
new kind of first-person shooter in
between the action the game tackled
social and moral issues and put the
players in front of some pretty tricky
choices but the single most interesting
thing about the first game was a world
in which it took place that world lies
leagues blow the sea and it's called
rapture rapture is a beautiful art deco
city an underwater utopia created by
Andrew Ryan the city was created as an
escape from social political and
religious anxiety of a post-world war
two written world as you probably know
not everything went according to plan in
rapture its inhabitants became addicted
to genetic modification turning the
majority of the population into
disfigured shadows of their former
selves 10 years have gone by since the
first game in the city has fallen ever
deeper into social and moral decay a new
antagonist doctor Sofia Lamb has risen
from the ashes of Andrew Ryan this time
with an imposing altruistic ideology
with some keen relations to Marxism
turns out the dr. Lam's idea of turning
rapture into an underwater socialist
colony has gone a bit awry and things
are worse than ever as you know the
first game was a great success and
bioshock 2 has a massive set of shoes to
fill especially because this time around
it's not developed by 2k bossom but a
subsidiary developer called to cameron
so the game definitely has some big
daddy size shoes to fill so in the
second game you play as a big daddy clad
in a deep-sea scuba suit and this
dynamic brings a few changes to the
gameplay first off your right hand is
now equipped with a pretty big drill I'm
not sure what the practical applications
are for a drill of this
but the drill does work pretty well for
making mincemeat of the inhabitants of
rapture and other violent full retards
the left hand is now free to use for
Adam induced plasmids so now you can
shoot your double barrel shotgun and
throw lightning bolts with your lefty
the story of Bioshock 2 takes you on a
fairly linear journey towards
discovering the fate of a little sister
who proclaims yourself to be the
protagonist daughter
along the way get some help from some
inhabitants of rapture will be get not
succumb to the fleet of the splicers
I've located a new train car but the
station still locked down and we're not
alone in here I see a shadow in the
security booth most of the story is
unraveled much like the first game
through recorded audio logs that you
will find scattered around rapture the
narrative of the sequel is quite a bit
more straightforward and tangible
compared to the first game which was
more of an unraveling mystery the novel
appeal of the city is gone radford self
is pretty much the same a little bit
more rundown but discovering the wonders
in the city is pretty much left in kursk
law the city is also a bit more linear
and there's not much exploring you can
do a minor complaint is that there's not
much variation than levels the same
shanty and decrepit scenery repeat
itself mostly throughout the game and
setting aside a few scenic underwater
shuffles I would have liked to seen some
more variation between the levels and no
there is no underwater gunplay you just
basically shuffle from one place to the
next being a big daddy brings its own
set of responsibilities and the little
sister dynamic and harvesting adam has
gone through a significant change after
taking down a big daddy you can now
adopt a little sister to harvest Adam
for you and harvesting Adam from dead
bodies always brings about a zone
defense against hordes of splicers who
also want a taste of their drug of
choice defending the Little Sisters can
get a bit repetitive but the trade-off
reward of Adam which enables new
plasmids makes harvesting dead corpses
worthwhile another variation thrown into
the mix our Big Sisters and if you
thought big daddies were hard to take
down big sisters are faster and more
agile and a huge pain in your metal
fatted ass what the game lacks and
storytelling an environmental
versatility in gains in gameplay
mechanics the new two-handed assault
scheme with weapons in one hand and
plasmids in the other work extremely
well and make the fighting that much
more injury and I can tell you that
about ninety five percent of bioshock
two is about shooting up the
neighborhood with various weapons and
plasmids most of the plasmids are
familiar from the first game but there
are some new interesting ones as well
the Scout plasma it allows you to survey
the area as a free-roaming ghost you can
now hypnotized and befriend the splicers
to fight along your side you can also
call in
security BOTS which are a definite help
in defending little sisters the amount
of enemies you encounter in the game
will overwhelm you at times and it seems
that there's not a moment of peace
you'll be attacked from all three
dimensions and you will not survive if
you don't use your weapons and plasmids
wisely and recruiting help will play a
bigger role in bioshock 2 when trying to
keep the little sister safe I played
through the game in hard mode with the
by two chambers switched off and I could
tell ya I had my work cut out for me the
game will challenge even the most
experienced FBS fans and you will find
yourself scavenging every corpse that
comes along or corpse that you create
and looting is essential in BioShock
because ammo is scarce and every coin
you find will count as you are in
constant need of buying health packs and
Eva films while I'm not that keen on the
low ammo situation in first-person
shooters in general it does serve its
desperation inducing purpose in bioshock
2 hacking has also received a nice
update in the sequel and has been
simplified to the point where it's now
possible to hack security BOTS for your
aid during an ongoing gunfight but some
I urge some caution here because I also
found that it's still quite easy to fail
at hacking and have the trap spring in
your own face overall the gameplay
mechanics have been refined from the
first game and bioshock 2 is fun to play
graphics wise bioshock 2 runs on the
exact same unreal 3 game engine as the
first game while the game looks good
after three years I really would have
liked to have seen some improvements to
the new underwater adventure it seems
that they've even used the same texture
packs from the first bioshock some of
which are bit soft and low res and i
think some of the character models could
have also used in tuning up i also have
to bring to light the reflective
surfaces for example the water affects
our question to believe low res on the
ps3 version on the pc with directx 10
support they look great but on the ps3
not so much the framerate is mostly
stable but it will start to dip towards
the end of the game where the action on
the screen gets increasingly hectic the
game is locked at a maximum of 30 frames
per second but you are given the
possibility of unlocking the frame rate
but I cannot recommend it because on the
ps3 it will result in a quite erratic
frame rate and some serious green terry
so i recommend leaving the frame rate
lock as is loading times on the console
versions of Bioshock can be a bit
lengthy it will take over minute to load
up a level which I think in today's
Sanders is a bit long overall from the
standpoint of graphics and performance
I'm a bit disappointed with the ps3
version of Bioshock 2 mainly because
there's very little improvement to be
seen from the first game the PC version
of the game of course runs and a 60 plus
frame rate but the port or to the PC is
a bit sloppy the wide screen resolution
is achieved by cropping a 4 pi/3 image
and the textures of the game are
adequate for council resolutions but not
quite adequate for high-res pc gaming
the pc version of Bioshock 2 is a
testament to the fact that game consoles
are currently holding back the
advancements in pc gaming graphics
from an artistic visual standpoint the
game excels the Art Deco architecture
and decor of rapture really set the mood
for the underwater utopia or dystopia
depending on the perspective overall the
game is not as impressive visually as
the first game but it's still one of the
best looking Unreal Engine 3 games made
today the atmosphere of the game is
nicely complemented by the music and
sound design which is as good as in the
first game the shrieks and agonizing
wailings of the splicers will send a
chill down your spine and annoy the hell
out of your spouse this is confirmed
Bioshock 2 also comes with a multiplayer
component which is easy to consider as a
bit unnecessary the story-driven first
game really did well without the
multiplayer but I'm guessing that the
turn of games today is that no matter
what the game it needs to have
multiplayer if you play a lot of
hardcore multiplayer games like modern
warfare 2 i'm pretty sure you won't
trade it off to play the multiplayer of
Bioshock 2 the game has all your
standard multiplayer modes with the
rapture and twist I did enjoy the
capture the little sisser mode which
really brings the defense and father
dynamics nicely into the mix the game
also has a progression and leveling
system much like that of modern warfare
the trial system lets you level up your
weapons and plasmids by completing tasks
within the game the big daddy suit is
also included in the multiplayer modes
and it is fun to play with but a bit
annoying to play against the suit really
unset the balance because for example in
deathmatch modes it seems to be quite
random who gets to find a suit and
wielded the plasmids do introduce an
interesting dynamic into the multiplayer
games but they're mainly only supportive
to the primary weapon to come to think
of it the multiplayer in bioshock 2
reminds me of time splitters which was a
fast pace in chaotic multiplayer game
from back in the day overall the
multiplayer component of bioshock 2 is
fine but you probably won't find me
playing so how did this equal to
bioshock stack up against the
expectations overall Bioshock 2 is a
good game but ultimately like many
sequels it gets overshadowed by its
predecessor the world of rapture is
starting to seem a bit stale after very
little of anything significant is
introduced at the environment itself
luckily gameplay wise it's fun as ever
and you will play through the game
solely because of the sheer front of
plane if you have the option the pc
version is the one that get nothing
beats a mouse and keyboard combo in the
first person shooter and the pc version
also looks best and high frame rate
makes it that much better a lot was
expecting for Bioshock 2 and for the
most part it meets those expectations
but still the game left me with a
feeling that it could have been more I
give Bioshock 2 and 8.8 for being a
solid first-person shooter that keeps
the Bioshock franchise running strong
towards most likely yet another sequel
