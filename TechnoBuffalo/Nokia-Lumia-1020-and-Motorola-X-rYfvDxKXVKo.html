to you by gamefly welcome back to
another episode of rumor roundup with me
your host Ashley escada or not John as
everyone's taken to calling me on the
internet rumor roundup is the show where
we take all the best tech rumors from
all over the Internet smash them into an
easily digestible capsule format and
deliver it to every week this week we're
talking about the motorola x an HTC One
for Windows Phone Facebook's foray into
RSS readers and the potential name of
Nokia's highly anticipated EOS phone
this is rumor roundup so let's get rumor
in facebook is reportedly looking to
fill the gaping RSS haul google reader
will leave when it shuts down on july
first how well word on the street is
facebook's developing a mobile RSS
reader that's reminiscent of Flipboard
the project is known as just reader and
it seems that after the relative flop of
Facebook home and the HTC first this is
another attempt by Mark Zuckerberg to
have access to whatever information hits
your smartphone he's allegedly watching
the project closely and providing
feedback to the reader team but at the
end of the day it'll be up to you the
users to adopt additional apps for the
massive social network I'll have some
serious competition though as sites like
digg AOL and even smaller startups like
feedly are scrambling to snap up
disenfranchised google reader users so
good luck suck the HTC One is proven to
be a wildly successful android flagship
and now reports are coming in suggesting
HTC is developing a clone of the one
that runs windows phone 8 it won't be an
exact copy but the sister one would
sport the same aluminum body Beats Audio
and a display between four and five
inches we'd hopefully see a 4.7 or 5
inch display mostly based on rumors that
this phone would have Microsoft's gdr3
update on board which enables support
for quad-core processors and 5-inch
1080p screens it would also make a lot
of sense for HTC who could use a little
o am partner cash and obviously
Microsoft would benefit via another
beautifully designed device for Windows
Phone 8 we got another peak of the
Motorola X the device Google
was reportedly working on alongside
Motorola Mobility this week it seems to
be a phone headed for the Sprint network
so it's possible it could bear the
photon branding we've seen from Motorola
devices on that carrier it's not
confirmed to be the Moto X in pictures
but the source involved believes it is
the Moto X and goes on to say the phone
has an approximately four and a half
inch screen android 4.2 point2 jellybean
16 gigs of storage a 1.7 gigahertz
Snapdragon processor and 2 gigs of RAM
on board those aren't exactly
mind-blowing specs but it'll be
interesting to see how Google balances
owning an active Android OEM with
appeasing third-party companies like
Samsung and HTC the X phone is
supposedly dropping some time in
September but i think that actually
seems a little bit late in the game for
those specs so let's hope we get a spec
increase or a sooner launch lastly we
may have a name for the newest windows
phone 8 flagship from nokia or nakia
depending on where you live in the world
the long-rumored and highly anticipated
Nokia EOS is a win phone 8 device with a
41-megapixel Carl Zeiss lens on board
with pure view technology will almost
definitely see the final product on July
eleventh at nokia's event but this week
the official name for the device may
have leaked infamous mobile leaker
@evleaks on twitter claims that the
Nokia EOS will officially be the Nokia
Lumia 1020 it makes the most sense
considering the Lumia 920 was the last
flagship Lumia or still going across all
of our fingers and toes and hope this
isn't just another AT&amp;amp;T exclusive here
in the US at lunch because the wait for
the Lumia 928 on verizon and t-mobile's
925 was way too long also carrier
exclusives kind of suck right we're
going to take a minute to thank our
sponsor today gamefly but games for your
console can be pretty pricey especially
if you're a power player who eats up
games like Last of Us or breakfast so
