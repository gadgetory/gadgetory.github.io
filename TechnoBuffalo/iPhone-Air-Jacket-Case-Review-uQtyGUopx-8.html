lakers calm here i want to talk to you
about an iphone case i've been using you
may have noticed it in some of my phone
comparison videos what it is is a black
air jacket put out by a company called
power support it's available online from
apple com or from an apple store for an
outrageous price of 3495 i'll show you
what it is in a second but it's by the
same company that makes the screen
covers for the iphone the glossy and the
mat that i personally use and this
actually comes with one glossy and one
matte screen protector so something to
keep in mind so let me show you what the
case looks like on first looks like that
there's a hole for the camera and
cutouts on the side it's open on the
bottom so which means it is dockable if
you use a universal dock or have an
iphone 3g dock so let me take it off on
show you guys what it is here it's
really nothing terribly fancy just a
thin piece of plastic really that
happens to be black you can see it's
even wearing off on the bottom it's just
clear underneath it doesn't do anything
except for protect the back of the
iphone i don't think it's going to do
much in the way of drop protection or
really anything else significant just
going to protect the back from getting
scratched if i had known that i may not
have bought it i was looking for some
more protection for the phone but what
are you going to do i'm sharing my
tribulations with you guys so one nice
thing about it though is it really
doesn't add any extra bulk to the phone
or any thickness you hardly notice it
and it makes it phone actually a little
easier to carry the back is sort of a
soft touch rubber finish similar to what
you find on let's say the HTC tilt and
some of the new AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon
t-mobile phones they have that soft
touch finish a fuel zones rubbery is it
feeling on the back so it definitely has
a nice feel to it and it really weighs
nothing so that's another nice advantage
so if you're looking for something just
to protect the back of your phone from
scratches and kind of minor things
this is a great you know device to have
although it is a little bit on the
expensive side if you're looking for
all-out protection from drops and such
this is definitely not something that
you would want to invest your money in
especially considering its 35 bucks but
it does come with two screen protectors
which are nice but not required so guys
jon rettinger with john for lakers calm
showing you the case that I views on my
iPhone and case you're wondering the
iphone is my daily phone I test quite a
bit of other devices but I generally
come back to the iphone it's what's in
my pocket every day even if I have phone
calls being forwarded to other devices
the iphone is always still with me so
guys hope you enjoy i'm jon rettinger
