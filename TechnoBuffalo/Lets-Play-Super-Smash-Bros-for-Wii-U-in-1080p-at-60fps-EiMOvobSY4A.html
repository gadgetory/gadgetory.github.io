executive gaming editor from
technobuffalo i'm here with a special
look at super smash brothers for the wii
u this is in 1080p at 60 frames per
second which is pretty awesome i'm
really excited that youtube is doing
this now ah that is my meebo mari bros i
have tamed him I just tapped him in we
are working on a review of the game and
I figured I'd just do one quick stock
match for you guys I'm gonna change it
to stock and then five lives each so I'm
just gonna get this out of the way I am
not that awesome and smash I mean I've
played a lot I'm just I'm not a
competitive player I play with my
friends on the couch and that's the
about the extent of my competitive
nature for this game so all of you
professional smashers out there please
do not be like pissed off and how
terrible I am at this game I'm gonna get
out of the way pretty quickly I will not
talk again for the duration this video I
think it's going to check in around
eight or nine minutes I'm not exactly
sure yet and if you want we can do more
I think Nintendo so that we can do up to
120 minutes prior to release date so if
you want to see more smash within reason
I suppose because there are some things
that we can't show you guys I will do it
otherwise thank you guys for watching
and make sure to subscribe and whatever
else and we also have a gaming channel
technobuffalo plays which hopefully
they've linked down there sort of slow
down cuz the holiday rush but who should
be getting back into it shortly so I'm
out of the way enjoy my terrible battle
prowess and just know that that Mario
there mari bro has he stayin that's my
level 11 amiibo I've only play with him
a little bit but he's pretty awesome
when we're in a team battle and you see
how that works thanks for watching guys
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
