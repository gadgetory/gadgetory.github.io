to you by audible hi internet i'm jon
rettinger and welcome back to an episode
of ask the Buffaloes the show you could
ask me any question you've got from the
web we're all the technology don't know
what phone to get can't make sense of
all those rumors not sure how to get
internet and every nook and cranny of
your house this is the show you can ask
tuan your question featured on an
upcoming episode every tuesday on
TechnoBuffalo com we put up an article
saying you should ask you a question you
can leave it down below otherwise if
you're more social networking inclined
you can send us a message on Twitter
either to me personally at Jonna for
lakers or the company at TechnoBuffalo
ask you a question use hashtag ask the
be usually will pick about four
questions each episode up this week
we're going to talk about how to extend
Wi-Fi covered in your house some stuff
about the HTC One and lastly we're going
to talk about whether or not this is the
last generation of consoles that's
actually going to have physical game
discs this is asked the Buffalo to go
and get started first question comes
from user at the sock I think that's how
you pronounce it at John for lakers hey
John do you think the iphone 5s will
have a 1080p screen or better I think
for sure we are going to see a 1080p
screen or retina display to or super
retina s extra retina display
awesomeness retina square everything
aside to call it I do think we were
gonna see the resolution upped in the
next generation iphone not saying the
screen is bad on the iphone but just to
say spec for spec look what we've got it
sort of become a marketing gimmick 1080p
is definitely going to be the way
they're gonna have to go we see it in
the HTC One the droid DNA is becoming
commonplace now so Apple wants to keep
their market chair they're gonna have to
up that screen I've been testing that
HTC One for awhile absolutely love it I
have fallen in love with the screen it's
actually awesome so I can't wait to see
what Apple can do with 1080p user I
tronox who asks hey John give any idea
how it can extend my Wi-Fi coverage in
my house well I can tell you what I do
I've got an airport extreme base station
you can also use a time capsule I've got
it right where my
internet comes in and throughout my
house I have to airport express is set
up they're super easy to set up you just
plug them into a wall you can do it from
your iPhone iOS device or through the
web portal and they will essentially
extend your network dinner as the house
it's not going to work to extend your
network across the street if you got to
get internet down to your basement if
there's a room that's just not getting
good service it's gonna be an awesome
way to go it is a little bit on the
expensive side each Airport Express
costs around 100 ish bucks there are
less expensive options out there linksys
has a few you can also check on router
extenders internet extenders on things
like that and see the best option for
you that's what's worked for me and it's
worked very well user Ronaldo RDS asks
hello there John hello Ronaldo if you
think that the HTC One is future proof
no nothing future proof do I think its
two-year proof yes at least as close to
the phone can be this thing has 802 11
ABG and an AC something that is not even
close a commonplace in fact I can't even
test 802 11 AC cuz I don't have anything
that runs on it got two gigs ram it's
got a really fast quad-core processor
don't get caught up on the number of
course because most of the applications
out there didn't take advantage of quad
core yet don't even think about how
eight core is gonna perform I'll tell
you this if I was going to sign a
two-year contract right now I would have
no reservations at all about signing my
name on the dotted line for an HTC One
so for that helps answer question these
are Mike pickle on ask do you think
optical discs are dead after the ps4
xbox 720 over they decided to call it
sing his games are too large for most
internet plans and flash storage is
really cheap we expect to have game
shipped on USB keys well the cheapness
flash storage is definitely up for the
beta Clifford tried to buy an external
flash drive or if you want to put a
solid-state drive into your computer
certainly it can be less than affordable
but thumb drive prices are certainly
coming down I do think this is gonna be
a laceration a console that we're going
to see physical game discs you look at
most games somewhere in the elite /
generation seven gigabytes that's a
little too much to be able to download
it over the air at least for most people
it can be condensed and it could be
expanded when it gets on the console
let's say we're looking at 10 gigabytes
just score to make a round number that's
gonna hit not only a lot of data caps
sirs need to take a long time to
download but the lifespan of consoles
we're looking at about
10 years for each console so now at a 10
years of preparation of internet speed
should be much much much quicker the
idea of game shipping on thumb drives
though is kind of interesting certainly
there's a lot of piracy issues that have
to be developed I don't think we're
gonna see that sort of middle ground
really ever become mainstream what I do
think though is that we are going to see
games go strictly online perhaps even
streamed got fast internet speeds
streaming games could be pretty cool
that was a long answer to saying yes I
think this last generation we're gonna
see physical disks which should also be
telling about what the future of blue
right might eventually be so let me take
