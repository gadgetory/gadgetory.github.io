comparisons for you of the blackberry
storm2
versus its older brother the blackberry
storm 1 so before we get deep into the
hardware let's talk about some of the
more aesthetic changes that you're going
to notice between the two devices well
first the storm 2 has its lock and power
button on the upper left-hand corner
whereas a storm 1 had just a lock button
power was done through the end sign the
storm 1 actually the storm 2 in
particular it uses a new iconography it
actually says 3G in the upper right hand
corner with a little blackberry icon
that you know you're connected to
BlackBerry's fantastic push email system
the storm 1 uses the more traditional
one times
evie to let you know you're connected to
Verizon Wireless as a video network not
a big change definitely something worth
noting both devices here are running the
newest versions other operating systems
5.0 so this should least be as fair
comparison as possible so I think that
anytime you talk about the storm and the
storm 2 you have to really lead in with
the keyboards so let's start with the
keyboard on the storm 1 was the first
phone to introduce technology called
sure press it's a capacitive touchscreen
so running similar to what's found on
the iPhone the t-mobile g1 but
underneath that was a sensor it actually
created a clicking feel so anytime that
you've pushed it on the screen you're
actually registering a click and felt
like a click under your finger with the
storm 1 there was only one sensor right
in the middle so anytime that you
clicked off the middle so the bottom
left or the bottom right I almost felt
like you were on a seesaw and if you
were trying to type and type letters
that word right in the middle definitely
led to a lot of increase in accuracy
blackberry is known for its fantastic
mobile email services so most people who
are using a blackberry email and text
communication is important to them
especially having an accurate keyboard
was one of the things that I think sunk
the initial storm another thing to
mention is that since the whole screen
actually recessed anywhere you want
there was ton of dust that was getting
caught all along the bridge of the
screen so eventually you have to pick it
out with a
paperclip or take it back to the store
have the screen pulled off because it
would just stop working now the storm 2
also uses sure press technology however
they use a different implementation of
it they use something that's called PCO
technology which is from tech mumbo
jumbo I'm not going to bore it with but
just know that they now have four
sensors underneath the capacitive
touchscreen one in each corner making
for a much much improved accuracy so
hitting things in the corners is now
much more accurate than it was hello
does a little bit feel a little bit
harder to press you have to press a
little bit more but you get a very
satisfying click and I think that the
improvements is found right when you're
using the keyboard so speaking of the
keyboard let me show you how that works
on the storm to be prepared to the storm
one I think that again this is where the
storm 2 really shines so I'm gonna open
up a new message here ok so I've got a
new message open and I'm greeted here
with a shirt tag keyboard similar to
what's found on the blackberry pearl
series and the pearl flip I'm actually a
big fan this your press I used a pearl
for years and I really liked it
essentially what it is is two words port
a letter now if you turn this you get a
full landscape keyboard as well so let's
do a keyboard demonstration on both and
I should mention that I'm not a
blackberry storm user so I've only
gotten to use these keyboards for the
past few days but I will demonstrate
their accuracy for you and then compare
that accuracy to how well things go on
the storm one for a comparison so how
much better typing is on the storm 2 so
we'll type a simple message this is a
test
so I got egos is our rear so me it
wasn't head accurate but it was quick
try that one more time so this is a test
I think it just took a little while to
get used to but definitely became a bit
more accurate as I used it let's rotate
it over to landscape and let's try the
same thing and see how this works now
one of the knocks that I had on there
storms keyboard was as you put your
finger up you got that blue glow it's
hard to tell which letter that blue glow
was coming from well it's not so
difficult with the storm - it seems to
actually be relatively clear let's try
that again and I'll go as fast as I can
this is a test perfectly accurate much
much easier to use much easier to
navigate and you don't wait as long for
the keys to pop back up so if that was
holding you off from buying a storm -
don't let the keyboard be a deterrent
it's actually very good and really easy
to use this time around so seeing how
good the keyboard is on the storm -
makes me remember how bad the keyboard
was on the storm 1 let's go ahead and
take a look at that you can see how far
things have come and this is even with
the newest form or update that
supposedly increases accuracy I'm going
to go into messages once again and we
will create a new one okay so here we go
our messages and you've got that same
sure type keyboard that we saw on the
storm - and let's see how I create this
one is so this is a test type tat no
problem and definitely feel a much more
squish and you have to wait a little bit
longer for the keys to pop back up but
not much to a problem in portrait let's
try it in landscape and we'll do the
same thing I'll go as fast as I can
so not entirely accurate screwed up on
one word but it can it can be fixed
I suppose keyboard has been improved
with a software update 5.0 on the storm
one but it still worlds better on the
storm 2 and speaking of text one of the
things now that you've got on the storm
2 it's also they move over to the storm
one is cut copy and paste although it's
sometimes a little bit of a sloppy
implementation so let me zoom in and
show you how cut copy and paste works
we'll use that same message that I just
typed it I'm going to demonstrate this
right now of course on the storm 1 so
while the both devices to necessarily
have multi-touch to way think of it
multi-touch like pinched and zoom like
you can do on on an iPhone does support
multi-touch in a way that you can
actually use two fingers on the device
so to cut copy and paste you take those
two fingers that we're talking about tap
on the screen and you get those two
little notifications that let you move
anywhere you want if you have a couple
lines it can be a little bit squirrely
seems to be working well right now by
the text that you want hit cut and do
the same thing when you want to paste it
let's take a look at that same
functionality on the storm to go ahead
and open up an email message so here's a
soliciting email to go ahead and say I
want to copy some of this text take my
two fingers
it doesn't always function the way you'd
like it to there we go and I can start
selecting text as you see as I move
around it follows with me and it tends
to jump around a bit but you can get it
to these accurate as you'd like with
just a little bit of time and patience
and go ahead and just hit copy and you
are all done so one of the big
complaints that people had with the
initial storm was that the screen
rotation speed was quite slow and I had
that too when I had the first storm that
since been fixed with the software
updates let's compare how fast screen
rotation now works on both devices so
let's start with the storm - quick quick
it's actually recognizing them when the
storm one first came out the very first
built-in software
it would hardly ever recognize a screen
rotation so that is pretty quick on the
storm - let's see how quick it is on the
storm one no not bad at all and
definitely is accurate so let's try and
put those two heads ahead and we can see
and again in some cases even the storm
one it was a little bit faster except
for there so overall if you're deciding
which one to get storm two just does
everything storm one did except a little
bit better just a little bit better
typing is a little bit better speeds a
little bit better internet browsing is
just a little bit better things are just
a little bit improved and speaking of
internet browsing the last thing I want
to show you is the internet browser how
this works and speed wise on each so
I've got three G bars on the same I've
got four three G bars on the storm one
I've got three on the storm two let's
load up a web page and see how it looks
well load up same web page pull the load
up youtube.com slash John four Lakers
and we'll see how fast they render over
exactly the same 3G network the storm -
by the way it does have Wi-Fi though
it's turned off for this test so they're
both off and the browser is just about
the same on both devices you do your
zooming with the zoom in and zoom out
buttons and you can pan relatively
quickly although you notice the
increased processor speed for panning on
the storm - and it looks like the storm
- is much faster already loaded on the
images and now it's already done and
complete and you can just double tap to
zoom in if you'd like and double tap to
zoom in if you'd like browser wise
you're not looking anything major that
changes what you had with the storm one
