TechnoBuffalo here the zenfone 1 is
yesterday's news we've got the sequel
the appropriately named zenfone 2 it
probably saying to yourself self what
makes the zenfone 2 special there's a
couple things first price 199 dollars
subsidy free this thing starts at that's
going to get you with two gigs of RAM
the atom 3560 processor and 16 gigs of
storage if you've got to pay a hundred
bucks more a $2.99 you're going to
double your RAM to a ridiculous four
gigs the atom 3580 64 gigs of storage
and also the boost master quick charge
technology built in let's go ahead and
take a look at this guy so I love that
the competition for these budget phones
at heating up and beyond that you're not
getting budget specs anymore you're
getting really incredible devices for
really reasonable pricing so I mention
the price already I talked about some
the specs but also has a few other
things that not a lot of other phones
have and I'm going to walk you through
that as we take a look at what's inside
we have the red version here it's also
available in glacier gray awesome um
black this is the glacier gold and sheer
gold so fancy names for gray black red
and gold so I can go ahead and open the
sucker up somehow I already cut the
plastic and there's a pull tab so I
assume I can pull
ah all right I had to go beast mode on
the boxes sucker open here friends is
the zenfone 2 and you can read the specs
but why read the specs when I could just
tell you about them let's go ahead and
pull the phone out there is the glacier
read push off the side for real quick
second and see what else Asus is going
to include inside of the box we've got a
Zeus phone in search of the incredible
we've got my presume is d a quick
charger think we've got the bigger skew
here and then we just have a microUSB
cable and that is about it so here is
the zenfone 2 let's pull off the plastic
okay really can't open anything there we
go no more plastic no more boxes
I now have these n phone - and look at
this thing from the front
I want to serve an HTC s look to it
which is to say very high quality look
and feel so this is a quad-core phone no
matter which view you get Intel
quad-core 64-bit gonna be clocked
probably around 2.3 gigahertz the screen
is 5.5 inches into 1080 screen so it's
1920 by 1080 it's backlit LED you can do
math very quickly that is 403 PPI of
course there's Intel Atom logo
protecting it is courting Gorilla Glass
3 with anti fingerprints so I'll be the
judge of that my fingerprints tend to be
extra greasy does have cameras this
little sucker on the back is made by
Toshiba it's a 13 megapixel camera with
an F 2.0 aperture it's got another
camera on the front this is an omni
vision camera it's five megapixel
storage as I mentioned is going to
depend on which one you get 64 gig
built-in but they're all gonna have
expandable storage you are going to have
dual sim so you can actually keep two
phones on two different networks up and
running and a 3000 milliamp hour battery
so I go ahead set this guy up we'll take
a look at the UI so I've got the back
off of this phone it does come off and
as well is removable not removable
though is the battery so there's sim 1
and sim 2 someone you're going to get
full 2g 3G and 4G LTE on sim 2 you're
going to get 2 G only so bear that in
mind and then you can see the
rear-facing volume buttons up
down then the middle on the top is for
your power button is going to be so
let's take a real quick look at the
software again this is just turned on we
have some software updates to run so
we'll review the full shipping software
when we do the full review I think there
a few updates going to be coming but
here is what the UI is going to look
like and this is based off of Android
5.0 lollipop in fact the current version
we have on here is 5.0 and you can see
what Asus has done there's an icon pack
on top and some animations but in a lot
of ways they've let Android be Android
as some interesting things if you jump
into your app drawer in the upper right
hand corner and I wish all os's had that
or all Android OS has had that uninstall
disable built right in high damps built
right in lock apps built Orion or setup
smart groups really handy to have built
in as you can see what a safes have been
include out of the box we've got some
apps for you game TripAdvisor Amazon
Kindle and zinnias and stuff you might
download anyway some quick transfer
built right in of course you have
Android 5.0 quick transfer as well
kids mode mini movie my Asus PC link and
a few others are going to come right on
board also comes with a theming engine
as well on notifications they are all
Android lollipop of course so you can go
ahead and swipe things off to the side
get rid of all and such I've got three
capacitive buttons down below I've got
your back home and your multitasking and
it is the card interface that we're used
to but when you hit that you got a few
other options here so let me open up
it's open up some app just so I can show
you what it looks like we'll open up
that open camera and there we go so now
you've got that bottom in the bottom
left that's going to show you the
running services what's running things
that you can always access from going to
your settings now you can access it
right from multitasking if you go I hit
the one in the middle you can pin things
right to the strange kind of nice so
when turned on you can use screen pane
to keep the current screen and view
until you unpin it I'll go ahead and go
back and show you what that third option
is I'm not just going to close all of
the applications and I'm sure there are
a lot of other software tweaks under the
hood that we haven't seen yet I will say
though for a phone that starts at 109
bucks nothing feels cheap about this
build quality it feels premium it look
Premium and if phone just looks really
nice especially in this red color so for
either 200 or 300 bucks you're getting a
really nice phone and the dual SIM you
know if you travel the great option you
could put in international SIM as well
as your current SIM and really have the
best of everything no matter where in
the world you are and I guess it's been
a first look at the Asus zenfone 2
anything you want to see us test further
be sure to leave it down below we'll
make sure that we do full software
updates and check everything new here
but time we do our full review until
then I'm Drive Ranger from TechnoBuffalo
