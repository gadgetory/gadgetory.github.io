technobuffalo here there's been a lot of
talk of flash recently not the creepy
guy in the park with the trench coat but
the kind of content that you get online
particularly there's been a lot of
discussion about its lack of device
support probably most well known to not
be present on the iphone ipod touch or
the upcoming ipad there's been a bit of
debate about whether or not flash is
important to have on your device I'm of
the mindset that the consumer should
have the choice and I want to show you
some of the benefits that you'll get
with flash 10.1 I am running this year
on the nexus one with the HTC desire rom
that i demonstrated yesterday let me
show you what you get with flash don't
got some flash games queued up here this
is from flash games 247.com before i
show you how this works let me show you
what Flash content looks like on an
unsupported device here we've got the
iphone with a sort of notorious blue
lego brick no flash content is supported
so go ahead and pick a game let's pick
stargazer have no idea what that is
connected over Wi-Fi here this should be
pretty quick immediately it starts
playing so I'm good all right all right
so i can go ahead and double-click and
it goes into full screen i can rotate it
and if I want you to this way a little
take a little bit better more suited for
this orientation and you can just start
playing just as you would on line and
get instructions or start and you've got
the lot of options for you can do here
so this is just a game for example
YouTube relies on flash supports you can
play videos in the browser and a lot of
websites have support for flash a lot of
advertisements or interactive features
are flash-based you can actually use
those on your mobile device you know I
think again you just should have the
option about whether or not they want
the extra battery drain that flash has
whether you choose turned on or off I'm
not the biggest fan of serve decisions
like that being made for me one of the
many reasons that I've actually liked
being able to have flash even just for a
day I found it to be very useful on a
lot of different websites so the big
question guys do you think flash is
important on your phone or your mobile
device you care or not care
very curious as to why leave a text or
video response and our guys and jon
