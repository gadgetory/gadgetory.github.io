technobuffalo here I'm taking a look at
the just-announced brand new Nexus 6p
the hallway built Nexus flagship there
is a lot crammed into this all-metal
body so I'm going to run through the
specs on what you can expect first
you've got a 5.7 inch display and Google
said that they're able to get a 5.7
display on a body size that most 5.5
inch phones had and they showed a
picture of the new iphone 6s plus so
bear that in mind for resolution you are
looking at the wqhd so pretty high
resolution 2560 by just about 1440 it's
being powered by the Snapdragon 810
processor and three gigs of RAM on board
on the back there's a camera you can
certainly see a bit of a pronounced
camera hump but it is not as pronounced
as some of the leaks led you to believe
it'll still sit almost flat on a table
so not nearly as bad as some people
thought I actually I kind of like design
and you get a chance to see it in person
that camera is a 12 point three
megapixel sensor that can shoot 4k video
on the front we have an 8 megapixel
shooter available 32 64 128 and of
course all being powered by Android
marshmallow keeping this guy do stuff is
a pretty beefy 34 50 million power
battery and charging it using if you
want to charge us fast you can use that
USBC built-in connector on the back
you've got that Nexus imprint
fingerprint sensor which come lock is
say in about 600 milliseconds it's very
quick I can be available in aluminum
graphite or frost on the right hand side
of advice you've got your power and lock
button and your volume button on the top
3 15 millimeter headset jack in those
antennae bands on the left hand side
that is where your sim tree is going to
be and it will work with all us kids got
all the band support I built right in of
course android 6.0 our shmellow here on
board as well any what do you guys think
with your thoughts on it should be
available soon available for pre-order
now from the Google store until next
time John render from technobuffalo so
guys next video buh-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
