to you by citrix gotoassist
the number one global market leader and
remote support what's up everyone
welcome back there episode of retina
drifts to show her I just talked about
anything in the tech world we just kind
of have a conversation now that all the
dust has finally settled on the galaxy
s6 galaxy s6 edge in the m9 finally talk
about everything that came out we sort
of beaten a dead horse all the specs and
that kind of stuff but a few things came
out of the events that thought worth
meriting a brand new discussion
Samsung's going a completely different
direction obviously with design but also
with functionality they're big things
they used to add in the past like
removable battery expandable storage are
now gone so I wanted to talk about
whether or not they matter do they
matter to you and really do they matter
to me one of the many different features
between iOS and Android is always been
the ability for expandable storage
Android has offered it seemingly from
day one and iOS has never offered that
any of their devices so what are the
advantage of expandable storage
obviously if you need more storage in a
phone you can pop in bigger cards that's
one seems pretty self-explanatory
but also swapping in music you're going
on a long flight you want to have a
fresh card of all your music or you're
visiting your grandparents house while
all your pictures on a card and put that
in your phone or tablet you've had the
option to do that in the past with
Android devices it's disagree with
Samsung devices that's been one of their
big selling points that is no longer
thing they are offering very large jords
capacities you've now got up to 128 gigs
of storage and 64 and 32 from my views
expandable storage hasn't been that big
an issue for me usually I just keep
everything on my phone and that's it I
don't have separate music libraries and
I manage or separate photo libraries I
manage I just keep it all in one place
but I recognize that I am probably the
minority there I know a lot of you
keeping work files on a car and you'll
swap it out or you'll fill up a card go
and buy another one it's also been a big
money-saving factor as well let's say
you buy a 16 gig phone and a 32 gig card
you've got plenty of storage if you fill
up the 32 gig card you always buy
another one of larger capacity that
haven't replaced the actual hardware of
your phone now though that's no longer
an option so I think it's a business
sense for Samsung they're sort of gonna
make you want to buy a higher capacity
phone the higher the capacity phone the
high the profit margin our solid state
drives have notoriously not only been
expensive but also had very high profit
margins for companies so it's a little
bit on the annoying side they not gonna
be able to do that
on the flip side though HTC has been
like whoa whoa we heard your complaints
about not having expandable storage
we're now going to offer that to you so
if that's something that you want in a
phone it's in a flagship the HTC m9 is
going to be one that offers it but the
big thing I want to talk about is
removable battery and again same thing
iOS never had it Android certainly it's
had at things in particular has had it
but no longer is that the case of people
are up in arms now kind of one as a
question is that rightfully so let me

Samsung Galaxy Tab four that's cool
think people that have thoughts on the
removable battery kind of fall in three
camps the first camp that just doesn't
care never bothered to buy another
battery anyway and it doesn't matter
whether they take off the back of their
phone or not there's a camp that likes
the option of being able to go out and
buy a bigger battery of thingy either by
another battery if they need the third
camp are those that travel at two three
four or more batteries with them to make
sure if the traveling they just pop in a
new one and be good to go I think if you
fall in category three you've got the
right to have take umbrage with
Samsung's done if you're in camp two
which I think it's kind of where I am
you know I always like to have the
option but I never bought another
battery I just never did I didn't want
to worry about charging another one and
find another external charger I just
didn't do it
maybe it's not that big a deal Samsung's
been pushing wireless charging quite a
bit they're saying now charge your phone
much faster wireless charging is much
faster it's it's compatible with all
major wireless charging standards so I
get it but for me it's never really been
an issue but I want to know am I on the
minority here do you care about
expandable storage did you care about
removable battery I don't and that
galaxy s6 edge is looking mighty sexy
and mighty hot for my phone money I
might be what I decide to pick up but
again tell me your thoughts doesn't
matter does it not mad
leave in the comments and we'll have a
discussion about what you guys say I
really just want to hear you know you're
honest talked about it nothing to really
do with what Apple does or what
Samsung's doing it just Samsung's new
direction rather so do you greet the
direction or driver san franciso go back
and sort of do it they've done up until
the note 4 which seems to be when the
design they would just kind of just
split off in opposite directions and i
guess i really just like to hear what
you think about it what your thoughts
are leave it all in the comments down
below so whether you're for or against
expandable memory get the video a thumbs
