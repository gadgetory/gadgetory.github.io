from TechnoBuffalo here with an unboxing
of the latest flagship from Samsung this
is if you can read the samsung galaxy
note 5 I'm really excited take a look at
this I have yet to see one in person
we've got the 32 gigabyte version here
done up in black it's kind of a blueish
black color also available in white the
box looks just like the current
generation samsung device there's
nothing really exciting on it we've got
some specs but you don't have to worry
I'm going to talk you through all that
it's go ahead and open this sucker up
and there of course sitting right on top
we have the note 5 feels good
drop to the side for a quick second to
Doc's are going to have inside of the
box we're going to have I can get it out
Quick Start Guide for getting started
quickly we have a sim removal tool for
even you can probably guess and here
inside we've got all kinds of stuff
we've got a power adapter that is not
going to work here in the US but if I
was able to plug that in it would be
quick charge enabled we've got this guy
which took me a while and a few new
version choice what this is this is a
tool to remove the tip of the s-pen and
put in fresh tips if you need we've got
a micro USB charging cord on no USB see
this is a standard micro then we've got
it appears to be a pretty nice set of
headphones at least in plastic not just
sitting on its own with noise cancelling
mic and it's to be a different size your
gels in there as well but none of that
is why you are here this is the reason
everybody's here to see the latest the
note 5 then go ahead and peel off the
plastic I can probably just slide it out
but that's no fun let's peel off the
plastic we're satisfying that way and
we've got the note 5 with its curved
glass back and feeling really nice I'll
go ahead and power it on and we can run
through some specs so it is a 5.7 inch
Super AMOLED display so that means it's
got a resolution of 2560 by 1440 and
also a 515 PPI it's Samsung is usually
pretty awesome
Super AMOLED technology here I think
Samsung makes some of the best screens
so we'll see how it translates to with
the note 5 powering this guy is just a
ridiculous octa-core chip it's the
Exynos
9420 also keeping this phone humming is
a ridiculous four gigs of ram a storage
no expandable storage but it is going to
be available in 32 or 64 no 128
available at least not yet it's also not
going to have a removable battery it
does have a 3000 milliamp power pack
onboard when the other cool feature is
of course with the current generation
Samsung devices it is that she and PMA
enabled so you can charge it with pretty
much any wireless charger this will
charge extra fast if you have one of
samsung's new wireless chargers a sort
of quick charge for wireless camera on
the back is 16 megapixel on the front
we've got a five megapixel sensor and of
course has NFC if you want a difference
between this and the galaxy s6 edge+
it's really just the curved sides and
the s-pen a little bit of width
difference this is seventy six point one
millimetres were three inches whereas
the s6 edge+ is a little thinner at
seventy five point eight millimeters or
two point nine eight inches we still
have TouchWiz here or these they're
modern you might see it looks like a few
changes we have a much thinner and
lighter version of Samsung's modern UI
or more commonly referred to as TouchWiz
this should be 5.1.1 base bullets go
ahead and check that for ourselves the
bottom about device and it is based on
5.1.1 so around the device you've got a
physical home button it's also your
fingerprint sensor flanked on either
side you've got capacitive a back button
in multitasking button on the left the
volume up and down on the right that's
where your power and lock buttons gonna
live on top there's your SIM tray
we've got noise cancelling mic you can
see the antenna bands on the bottom
micro USB speaker we've got noise
cancelling mic 3.5 millimeter headset
jack and the s-pen you probably saving
yourself self how do I get that S Pen
out I will tell you in just a moment the
back it's the same glass covering that
we've seen on the s6 the s6 edge but now
it's got a curve to it on the back you
can see or on the sides curves make it
feel nice in the hand they will say it
certainly does to pop the S Pen out it's
now spring loaded to do a little push
and it pops right out you can pull it
and other device and you're immediately
greeted with air command this is how you
can go ahead and launch different things
here with the S Pen new though you can
now add shortcuts if you want to launch
an app or something and go ahead and
so let's say you always want to use
Chrome and go ahead and set that maybe
you like to use Instagram you can set
that there to go ahead and go back and
now it'll show up and you can launch it
very nice and easily the S Pen feels
almost identical to the last version
that doesn't feel heavy is not much
weight - it does have a physical button
but now you can know people I mean oh it
actually surf sit there and click it
when you are in meetings just like you
can all on a normal pin I think one of
the coolest features though of the S Pen
you have to enable in setting it's
called off-screen memo to go ahead and
eject the S Pen it looks like the screen
is off but you can actually start
writing on it almost like you can on a
blackboard or even a pen and paper any
notes you want and get scribble notes
and you can go ahead and save it
directly to your device save or delete
it and you'll have those notes there
ready for your really handy quick
features you want to write down a phone
number something you can go ahead and do
that I will draw you a smiley face
because I am feeling happy so that is
here as well
push the S Pen back I haven't always
been the biggest fan of TouchWiz I will
say it was much lighter and easier to
use and less to learn and less
cumbersome unless additions in the
current generation of Samsung devices
fluro hug in apps there's still a decent
out of things pre-loaded in here but a
very little carrier bloatware this isn't
a carrier branded device this is their
unlocked international version which
will not be sold in Europe so if you're
in Europe when you wanted a note you are
going to pay a lot of money import it
not sure why same things I had to do
that but they felt like you did not want
a stylus you can see the icons look like
one of the beauties of Android though if
you don't like this Google now launcher
Noble on show or a slew of other
launchers are just an app store download
away so we're gonna do a full review in
a full test of the note 5 and put it
through its paces a little test battery
will test camera and the likes but this
time I think you guys want to see in
particular leave in the comments down
below we'll be sure to test it for you I
think you guys for watching and hope you
enjoyed until next time I'm John Ranger
