that came well Happy Holidays everybody
and welcome to my humble abode I was
going to emulate my buddy
Nick Offerman here but somebody in the
office drink all my office whiskey so I
don't have my whiskey but that's okay
we're talking about the Nexus 6p we
already have a review up so you can
check that out if you want more details
you can check it out right here but I've
been using this as my daily driver for
the last few months since it came out
basically and I wanted to do a quick
revisited just kind of let you guys know
how it's been over the last few months
so first of all the build on this thing
is fantastic and I think that we all
knew that going into it it feels really
really nice in the hand that full on
aluminum body just feels great but damn
it is so slippery it is so so so so
slippery and when you're in bed trying
to use it side to side it slips right
out especially it's a little colder out
this time of year
the aluminum gets really cold and that
really just adds to the slickness so I
really like to keep it in this case this
is the official Google microfiber case
and it's really comfortable doesn't add
too too much bulk it has a nice little
cutout here for your fingerprint reader
and it really helps with with grip when
you're laying down so I really like this
thing but the build overall is fantastic
it's just too slippery the camera on
this thing is fantastic and that's been
a huge sticking point for Nexus devices
everything from the actual optics to the
software so while they nailed it on the
optics the software is still so bad and
it's not even a usability thing anymore
it's really more of an engineering thing
I have missed so many shots on this
thing and the sad thing is it takes
phenomenal photos but this day and age
top of the line Android device
Snapdragon 810 there's just no excuse in
my mind for missing photos on a device
of this nature dude we have a dog in
here we have two dogs in the office I
need to be ready to take photos at a
moment's notice
so performance on the camera side hasn't
been fantastic but performance on the OS
side has been pretty darn good
marshmallow on this thing runs really
really smoothly the only thing is it's
pretty clear to me that that Android
still has a number of memory management
issues I find myself rebooting this
thing once maybe twice a week believe it
or not because I find that even just
doing a simple thing like googling a
location on Google Maps or trying to
find something on Foursquare we
ends up taking much much longer than it
should for again a device that's a
Snapdragon 810 it's the top of the line
and then after I reboot everything goes
right back to being perfectly fine so I
think there are still some memory
management issues which is kind of
annoying and then also on the software
front for some reason it works fine on
my wife's Nexus 5x okay Google just
never seems to work for me
I I don't understand what it is about
this device I've trained it a million
times I don't know if it's this one in
particular or if it's the Nexus 6p but I
can't get okay Google to work
consistently what happened did the video
end are we on a different video now let
me know if you guys have had similar
experiences any of you who own a 6p let
me know in the comments are you
experiencing the same stuff with okay
Google are you experiencing the same
kind of stutters with with random usage
about once a week and then let me know
how your camera is performing because
I'm really bummed to say that even
though they've got the optics up to
speed that the camera software just is
not anyway thank you guys so much for
watching happy Holidays to everybody
whatever it is that you celebrate this
time of year happy winter solstice be
with your family have a fun time be kind
to one another
and I'll catch you in the next video you
know what I hate about the holidays guys
I love the holiday season but I hate
eggnog haters I'm a huge fan of eggnog I
make my own from scratch I cook the
custard I get the nutmeg in there I do
the whole nine yards they make multiple
batches a year and it's so delicious I
will never understand the kinds of
people who don't like it so to that end
I was thinking maybe I should setup
eggnog love it is available right now
from domain.com and that's where I was
gonna go to head to register you can
just go to domain.com type in what you
want they've got a ton of things there
it's really super easy to do plus you
save 20% off when you use the code
TechnoBuffalo which obviously I'm gonna
do when I go set up my eggnog fansite so
let me know you guys think about eggnog
actually no don't cuz I don't really
care all that much eggnog is the best
beverage in the world anyway when do you
think of domains think domain.com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
