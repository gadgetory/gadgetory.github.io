TechnoBuffalo here with a feature
overview for you of the Newton message
pad 2100 by Apple people are asking me
why I'm showing a device that's 13 years
old that no one has seen for close to a
decade and a half and the answer is
really simple
I think the Newton message pad helped
pigs away from uh turn PDAs and
smartphones and you'll see why in just a
minute
also it's interesting to see how Apple
really implemented user communication
with a tablet or slick device as rumors
of Apple's isolate or whatever they're
gonna call it are really starting to
come to the surface have a handle text
input and have the handle controls
Without Really many physical buttons and
only physical buttons that Newton has is
just a power button like it's especially
a pertinent to see how they've done in
the past maybe get some instances and
ideas of how they may do it in the
future also some of the designers on
Newton projects are supposedly some
designers that are working on the
isolate so there are a lot of
overlapping things there keep in mind
this is still a thirteen year old
technology so try and keep into
perspective how this might have looked
back then so what we have right here is
the main note screen this is the
probably the main thing of the device
and what we use use it most for so you
answer all your text and handle most of
your entries let me go ahead and show
you how it works this handles text
entries in a few ways the first one I
want to show you is via stylus and of
course is a resistive touch drink don't
even thought of capacitive fact 13 years
ago still even 13 years later this is
probably some of the best handwriting
recognition software I've ever seen it's
not entirely accurate but it's very very
close and extremely good and how it
handles a text interaction editing the
text I think is most important let me go
ahead and show you it's broken up the
two panels right here I've got our
recording button down below phone record
voice no take advantage of the built-in
microphone or a simple text entry right
here and go ahead tap the screen that
brings up a cursor you can see that a
little half carat I could move that
around anywhere I want just by tapping I
necessarily have to start writing right
there but that's where the text appears
I'll put it up in the upper left hand
corner like I'm actually gonna write a
note
and we'll just start typing anywhere I
want to alright this is a test and you
see it starts to populate up there this
is a test it got it completely right you
can change this to use cursive or
regular handwriting my handwriting is a
mess anyway so we're gonna stick with
this let's go ahead and write something
different we'll start it down here and
I'm gonna try and write messy so it can
see if it makes a mistake or two and
we'll write this as a test again service
fast and as sloppy as I can so didn't
even get that close so let's say I want
to edit one of the words I wrote this is
endo are not quite close and I want this
to say test at the end well I got you
right right over the letters it's a
really cool way to correct text you have
to move your cursor highlight the letter
and then start typing you actually just
right right over it so let's make that
entity for example now it's a team make
that D and E comes in E and now suddenly
it says this is a test pretty neat so
how do you handle so many other text
entries how do you delete or copy or
move stuff around well let me show you
how to do that we'll deal with this
piece at the top if I tap to the left of
it make that a little squeaky noise I
can actually drag the cursor and it
highlights the text now if I just tap it
I can move it anywhere I want and if I
double tap and move it's actually gonna
copy it for me oops go ahead and delete
this little try this piece of text right
here you know copied it so I've got
these bits of text everywhere how do I
delete them well just the way you really
knew water and expect you to sort of
scribble over it and I'll delete it for
you some things you have to highlight to
the leaf first some you don't
but generally I found it works best if
you're going to highlight the text so
it's pretty intuitive actually to work
and erasing just sort of start drawing
over them
and they will all disappear all so it's
kind of satisfied at scribble you hear
that animation you see the animation and
the text or image disappears there are a
few other ways to input text as well let
me show you what those are so this is
really one of the earlier devices to
have a on-screen keyboard and it's sort
of big I don't think you can type with
your fingers but it's not bad for using
a stylus so I'll try that again and see
how quickly we can go so you get this is
a test again you get that sort of
keyboard or a typewriter sounding noise
nothing you know that revolutionary but
at the time thirteen years ago it was
pretty neat to have this sort of text
entry we'll go ahead and delete that
we're going to close or closer rather by
that X in the bottom right corner sort
of weird to see an Apple device with the
X but that's how it worked now you can
also go ahead and delete this here now
you can also draw shapes and Newton does
a really cool job of recognizing shapes
and actually if you're fixing them for
you I'll show you how that works as well
so I hit this button right here it looks
like an A I can go to shapes and now I
can start drawing some shape so I'm
gonna draw it say a circle the best I
can
I'm certainly no artist but solid the
Newton corrected it to make it more of a
round circle try and make this one look
a little less circling so you're sailing
in dude and sort of brought it together
they're gonna fix it in a trace sir
square squared it will try a rectangle
so it made it look a little better you
know same thing with triangles it'll
just make them look a little bit better
and things work the same as far as
highlighting and moving things around if
you'd like or even just drawing right on
top of it it's pretty neat actually sort
of move the triangle anywhere you want
if you were doing floor plans with the
example of what I would want something
like this if we doing graphing to make
it look a little more exact and again a
lot of this seems like yeah of course
but keep in mind again this is 13 years
ago so in fact the device
do this was really cool this is really
before palm and the palm pilots started
coming around and even had some sort of
handwriting recognition even then they
had a set formula you had to follow the
dryer letters those it might remember
the old Palm Pilot even the old trios
you can already want the draw key you
had to follow a very exact pattern to
draw your letters if you deviated from
that pattern that the text wouldn't
recognize here you can really draw
letters any way you want it and it works
quite well the different does a lot of
other things as well you can do a lunch
tray some of them here you go to new
it's can do an outline for example if
you are in class you'll have to take
notes it's great for doing bullet points
so you can select icon your outlines to
be where they're indented how you want
them set up or a new one so I just sit
in class you can start typing and it'll
pull it right up there you know this
class sucks it's really probably what I
would have written oh and I was sitting
in class so there's a lot of other
things that you can do you can move this
part down so you don't want to record
you can have full access to the screen
the Newton really did a lot one of the
biggest drawbacks of a Newton I'm gonna
pan back just a bit is these sides of
this thing this is nothing that you
could just throw in your pocket I mean
it was really big and very thick as you
can see it's something you definitely
want to keep in your bag and just hope
that nothing would happen to it it was a
very cool device and I'm really enjoying
playing with it
I'll come back in this video series and
show you some other things that Newton
does and I'll just give you sort of a
sense of maybe how Apple handled text
input in the past on a tablet and I'll
hand Apple may handle in the future with
their isolate or ever they're going to
call their new tablet so I hope you guys
enjoyed the sort of flashback of look at
some old Apple technology it doesn't get
much love this was the last Newton
message pad that came out with a 2100 I
ran just about a thousand dollars when
it was released which is sort of the
same price point we're hearing about for
Apple's new tablet you know it could
play a kind of your sounds back to the
speaker built-in microphone showed many
shades of gray of just quite neat older
models didn't really have this virtual
icon array across the bottom so the the
message pad had some very
we'll in advanced technology for its
time had some features that really are
impressive right now you know this had
copy and paste the iPhone it was
launched didn't even have that you know
there's a lot of talk being made over
the advantage of a capacitive
touchscreen I certainly agree I think
capacitive but certainly the future and
a more advanced way to interact with the
touch Bernie but we are dealing with the
resistive you do get to use a stylus for
better or worse this is one of the
better stand points we can actually can
write right on the screen so I don't
know how bad was gonna be able to do
some sort of finger writing whether you
could write with just your fingertip I
don't think that would work so well but
maybe it'll be a virtual keyboard and
maybe would be even that weird bumpy
haptic keyboard we saw them Pat but just
for fun I'm gonna try typing with Marv
writing with my finger and see how that
would work if I was using that
capacitive touch screen without the
stylus so right off the bat you can see
that it's much harder to write small I
really had to write as big as I could
it's having a hard time recognizing it
because it's completely inaccurate so
you can definitely get a sense that
maybe using your finger to write actual
tech to be difficult so we'd have to
imagine we'll see some sort of virtual
keyboard on the new tablet an apple is
supposedly releasing we're going to
announce at the beat end of January
