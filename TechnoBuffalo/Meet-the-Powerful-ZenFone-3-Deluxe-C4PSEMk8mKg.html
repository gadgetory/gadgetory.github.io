and PCs but you should take notice their
phone division if we just got the
zenfone 3 and a few days ago I want to
share some first impressions with it
because it's been really impressive
so first they're naming SCADA this phone
is a bit ridiculous
you've got the zenfone 3 deluxe and then
you've got the zenfone 3 deluxe special
edition specs are the main difference
between the two we've got the deluxe
version which is pretty friggin - luck
for $4.99 bucks you're getting six gigs
of RAM Snapdragon 820 a 23 megapixel
sensor on the back and a Sony sensor so
it's one of the best out there was crazy
camera technology packed into it a lot
of audio technology packed in here as
well you can customise your audio
experience and as headphone jack quick
charge 3.0 a really nice metal build
including this metal on the chanter lis
like to see so the bad stuff out of the
way it's certainly that bad I'm the
biggest fan of the Zen UI skin on here
but the nice thing about Android there's
the App Store with the ton of launchers
and then you know the deal said anymore
but I did keep it on to test it very
animation heavy and it does offer some
really nice things so multitasking for
example there are three buttons down
below one's going to clear all it's also
going to tell you how much RAM it freed
up which is kind of cool
unnecessary with six gigs but just kind
of like to know other ones got you pin
screens for the screen you want to keep
up for some reason and go ahead and and
and do that which is kind of nice to see
and the third one is going to show you
all of your apps that are opened it's a
real quick shortcut it's going to launch
into that really nice to see there I
like having three actual buttons or
capacitive buttons they light up so you
can know what you're doing instead of
having on-screen buttons at hide or not
hide I prefer this setup other a few
nice things about this phone you can
either make it dual SIM or one sim plus
microSD card I like that they are doing
a lot of manufacturing going that
direction so you can pick whether or not
you want to Sims or not but really nice
to have that option storage wise this
thing at 64 gigs the special edition up
set up to 256 so a lot of storage
onboard and you can always expand it the
phone's looks and feels way more premium
than the price the camera focuses
fast pictures look really solid this
seems more of a flagship type phone to
me than a phone that's priced kind of
mid-range so 500 bucks it's not cheap
the fingerprint sensor on the back works
quickly but it's kind of weirdly shaped
super narrow haven't had any issue with
it not working but bear that in mind
it's definitely different than sort of
the circle you see in the past you've
got multi tone flash in the back but
everything it expect from a feature
packed phone is here I don't have many
knocks on it things like USBC
loudspeakers 1080p display it's Super
AMOLED so it looks really nice
want to pick one up link to it down
below and again I'll test it see if my
opinions change as I use it to your
battery life performs check it in the
low-light and see how the cameras going
to you so next time ja trend your
Kentucky Buffalo then film three</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
