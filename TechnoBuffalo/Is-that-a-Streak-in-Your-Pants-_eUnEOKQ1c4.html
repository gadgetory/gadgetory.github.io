technobuffalo here and i want to show
you how using the 5 inch dell streak
tablet is going to work as a phone and
how it's going to be stored if you have
to put it in your pants which is always
funny to say so sit back and enjoy the
video so let me apologize beforehand for
the construction noise in the background
there's really no way for me to block
that out so Dell is just getting ready
to release the streak to the US shores
is a 5-inch android-based tablet when
the biggest questions I've been getting
on Facebook Twitter and YouTube is how
are you able to use this thing as a
phone is it going to fit in your pocket
is it going to fit in your pants i'm
going to give you guys a pants on
demonstration so first let's see how
this is going to use as a phone so a 5
inch tablet when you hold it up to your
face you can serve to get a profile what
that's going to look like it looks silly
the phone is not very heavy so you're
not gonna have sort of arm fatigue you
may get some strange looks from people
walking by I've actually been using this
for the past few days as my phone is it
does support at ATT 3g networks people
keep looking at me like I've got you
know another head coming out the side of
me it just looks very strange but it
doesn't feel bad which is quite
surprising the speaker is very well
placed and microphones are very well
place got speaker microphones right in
the middle actually as you talk and sort
of a perfect distance from your face so
you can see it's not as bad as you'd
expect I certainly wouldn't want to have
very long conversations and walk around
the street with this certainly if you're
going to use it as a phone you're
probably going to be tied to some sort
of Bluetooth device so either a
Bluetooth speaker or a bluetooth headset
so for a comparison let me show you what
it's going to look like next something
like the iphone 4 you can sort of see
what it looks like so here we've got the
dell streak in one hand and we've got
the iphone 4 on the other you can sort
of see that there is definitely a sized
in between or holding it now what about
some of the other tablets coming out for
instance the 4.3 inch devices like the
evo 4g or the droid x is it really going
to be that much of a difference sort of
question people are concerned about you
got something like here the droid x on
one side that's certainly a very big
phone its own right sort of put them
next to each other something the streak
doesn't look as Biggs if you can get
used to holding enjoy x or an EVO 4g you
could probably get used to holding the
dell streak next question is all right
and we'd use as my phone
how the heck am I going to carry it with
me so I'm going to go ahead and
seductively move the camera downwards
and I'll see how it's going to look in
sort of a variety different situations
probably not an angle that I film with
very often but I'm just wearing a pair
of regular blue jeans sort of average
tightness and I've got nothing in my
pocket right here go ahead and put the
dell streak in answer to see how that
looks in a normal pair of pants you can
see that it definitely makes an outline
you can I can already see the jokes
flying here but you can't really see
that it takes up a lot of room in the
pocket and as you walk it something that
you definitely would feel as you moved
around it's not bad it definitely fits
in jeans but it's certainly not going to
be the smallest unnoticeable device I
feel look at one of the 4.3 inch of Isis
it will bring back here let's say the
droid x it's much less noticeable this
is really where the 4.3 vs. 5 comes into
the biggest play is when you're wearing
a pair of jeans really when you're going
to feel it I know a lot of people put it
say in their back pocket it does fit
nicely serve in a back pocket usually
hangs out a little bit but you don't
want to sit on it even though it does
have a gorilla glass odds are you're
going to break it and I honestly cannot
wait to the comments on this video
mostly because of well this here angle
let's go ahead and try on a few other
things and see how they look alright so
next up in my technology fashion show
which is a pair of shorts how was
something like the streak going to fit
in your shorts pocket actually here it's
not too bad sort of looks a little bit
of a gear side but you don't even notice
it doesn't take up much room and there's
plenty of room for other stuff you know
such as keys so short to not give you a
problem if you're wearing a pair of
cargo shorts like this the dell streak
is certainly going to be plenty
pocketable alright so the geeky and
possibly per view wardrobe changes
continue got a pair of dress pants on a
dell streak is certainly aimed at
professional users who probably we're
going to be wearing pants similar to
this how are you gonna carry their
device with them let's go ahead and take
a look how it fits in a pair of dress
pants and that just looks plain silly i
mean the device is big dress pants are a
bit tighter you're definitely not gonna
be able to pull us off I think turn
sideways we're going to look at you
you have something very strange growing
right near it so I definitely don't
recommend using the streak for dress
pants here it's just going to look
strange are you looking at something
again like the 4.3 inch screen on the
droid x certainly not as bad let's go
ahead and mosey the camera up and I'll
give you guys hopefully a less pervy
angle to look at here okay so that was
sort of a hands face and pants look at
how the dell streak is going to look up
to your face and sort of in a variety of
situations it really was a very popular
question I got a that I got asked a
quite a bit hopefully this helped shed a
bit of light on it it's certainly a
pocketable device not the most
pocketable device you may get some
strange looks or some good looks
depending on where you are but knocking
me something you're going to want to
carry in your pocket I don't believe at
all times I know my guys i'm jon
rettinger from TechnoBuffalo and i'll
see you next video bye bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
