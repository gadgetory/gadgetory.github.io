to you by go daddy what's going on guys
the markings hanging from TechnoBuffalo
and today we'll be checking out the
iPhone 6 and iPhone 5s and see whether
you should upgrade or not so is it worth
the upgrade we've already reviewed the
iPhone 6 and 6 plus but if you're coming
from the older iPhone 5s is the iPhone 6
worth the upgrade in terms of hardware
the iPhone 6 features a 4.7 inch display
with a resolution of 1334 by 750 the
pixel density of 326 PPI equipped with
Apple's new dual-core 8a chip clocked in
at 1.4 gigahertz comes with 1 gigabyte
of ram and a 1810 milliamp battery it
now has NFC built in which unfortunately
can only be used for Apple pay at the
moment and it comes in space grey gold
and silver
now storage option includes 16 64 and
128 gigabyte and it's priced at $1.99
$2.99 and $399 respectively with a
two-year contract it's packing a whole
new 8 megapixel iSight camera in the
back that can film in 1080p 60 frames
per second in slow motion 720p at 240
frames per second there's a new FaceTime
camera up in the front too that features
a new sensor with the larger aperture
which lets an 81% more light into the
sensor and that essentially improves
face detection in the last for HDR video
and burst mode iphone 5s on the other
hand features a 4-inch display with a
resolution of 11 36 by 640 and a pixel
density of 326 PPI its equipment apples
dual-core a7 chip clocked in at 1 point
3 gigahertz it comes with 1 gigabyte of
RAM a 1570 milliamp battery and storage
options of either 16 or 32 gigabytes for
$99 and $149 with a two-year contract it
comes in space grey gold and silver and
the iPhone 5s also carries an 8
megapixel iSight camera though without
the newer sensor you can film in 1080p
at 30 frames per second and slow-motion
720p at 120 frames per second now when
it comes to design Apple is taking a
very different approach with the iPhone
6
gone are the Sham furred edges that
lived on iPhone 5s in favor of a curve
more unibody look the sleep/wake button
has been moved to the right side of the
device
or easy access while the volume buttons
are now more elongated and easier to
press the most noticeable difference
between the two is how thin the iPhone 6
is compared to the iPhone 5s the iPhone
6 is just 6.9 millimeters compared to
the 7.6 millimeter iPhone 5s both iPhone
6 and 5s have aluminum backs and
toughened glass fronts and they both
feel like premium devices the six is
rounder design is definitely starting to
grow on me and I think it's the perfect
form factor it's not too big where it's
unwieldy and not too small where it's
similar to the 5s screen you get bumped
up from four inches to 4.7 inches and
the iPhone 6 feature is 38% more pixels
than the 5s but it's not necessarily
sharper than the 5s both phones at 326
PPI displays which means both have
nearly identical screens of course a
larger display is always going to be a
bit more satisfying for browsing the web
watching videos and playing games though
the iPhone 6 does feature dual domain
pixels for wider viewing angles and
better contrast ratios in terms of
camera I've always like the iPhones
camera and how it handles exposure
colors in detail though Apple hasn't
really changed a great deal in the
camera the iPhone 6 it still has an 8
megapixel sensor it still has an F 2.2
lens which is what the iPhone 5s has
though the new sensor is what Apple is
pushing towards consumers it's focused
pixel technology provides the sensor
with more information about your image
which gives you better and faster
autofocus and clearer images indoors and
outdoors both the 5s and 6 captures
great images color seems a bit more
accurate on a 6 over the 5s and when it
comes to camera performance the 6
outperforms the 5s here if focus is
really quick and works well in low light
and the other advantage of the iPhone 6
is the ability to film in 1080p 60
frames per second in 720p at 240 frames
per second which includes cinematic
video stabilization and continuous
autofocus whereas the 5s can only shoot
at 1080p at 30 frames per second and
720p at 120 frames per second if you're
in a video the 6s camera is a great
upgrade over the 5s but photo quality is
nearly identical let's take a quick
break from this video and thank our

limitations of
I see website for details battery life
Apple is chosen to make the iPhone 6
slimmer rather than significantly adding
to the battery life the iPhone 6 is
equipped with a 1810 milliamp battery
while the iPhone 5s is equipped with a
1570 milliamp battery the iPhone 5s is
battery life is roughly the same as the
iPhone 6 and we got about an hour of
difference between the two phones
software both are pretty much the same
the iPhone 5s can be updated to the
latest iOS 8.1 where apps like the Apple
Store uber target and a few more have
support for Apple pay using the 5s is
touch ID overall there's no difference
between the iPhone 6 and iPhone 5s in
this department they're both pretty fast
and I haven't really noticed any big
difference between the two so is it
worth the upgrade it's so so if the
slightly better camera screen Apple pay
matters to you more than battery life
then I would upgrade the iPhone 6 myself
personally would still choose a 6 plus
over the 6 because it offers a bigger
screen with landscape support throughout
I owe s as a better battery life and has
optical image stabilization which the 6
doesn't offer the 6 in my opinion is
just an incremental upgrade from the 5s
and doesn't really feature anything
breathtaking anyways that's it for this
