unboxing for you of the surface sound
compact by contour it is a portable
bluetooth speaker men's to go writing
the visor on your car the folks at
contour and is nice enough to send this
pop your over for review let's go ahead
and get to the unboxing clear cover on
the front some light cardboard down
below lets you know what the device is a
picture up top that shows you how it
goes on your visor it's actually very
thin which is quite nice on the back
there's more images about the device how
it works clips right on it's got a
little bluetooth antenna some
information about it standby time up to
21 days bluetooth certified USB car
charger 15 hours talktime voice alert
come to the USB cable so i'm actually
pretty excited to use this i use a
bluetooth headset in my car I don't have
bluetooth built-in and the headset is a
great option but it can be a little too
cumbersome the headset can fall out the
battery life because the device is so
small isn't always that strong so I'm
really looking forward to having
bluetooth which like in my car so let's
go ahead and open this thing up alright
so I'll go ahead and cut right in and if
you like what you guys see it's a $99
device that would be available on
contours website i will put a link to
that up on the sidebar cut the straight
down
alright that should be enough to open it
up couple weeks ago and I did that
Oscars event with my gear store the they
had a few of these contour devices out
there and they were really big hit and
that's one first time I saw it so I'm
really again excited to have one of my
own quick difficult to unpack though
alright so we got the good stuff out
here is the headset of a speaker it
really is quite thin actually this is a
little bit of a push in so let you know
that actually is a whole speaker go
ahead and put it down here antenna pops
up it actually turns it on I'm going to
turn that off there now there are some
physical buttons here there is a volume
up and volume down and there's a call
and and a call hang up on and there's an
LED indicator light right there on the
back you've got the visor clip some
speaker ventilation ports is also a 3.5
millimeter headset jack and your micro
USB port let me show you guys how thin
this actually really is there it is next
to the iphone 3g and its market ibly
thinner very impressive the contour is
able to put a speaker this powerful on a
package that then let's see what else
comes in the box slice down in here well
3.5 millimeter headset the mono speaker
car charger USB got a ton of these later
rounds and a micro USB to USB the same
charger that the kindle uses so guys
