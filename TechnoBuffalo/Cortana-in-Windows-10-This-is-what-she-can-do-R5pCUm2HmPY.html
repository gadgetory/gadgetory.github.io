to you by domain.com hey what's going on
guys a Marklin Sangin from TechnoBuffalo
and today we'll be talking about Windows
10 more specifically about Crotona we've
been playing around with the new OS for
the past few days and we thought it'd be
perfect to go over some of the things
you can ask Cortana which is best
described as a combination of Google now
and Apple Siri she provides information
when you ask for it and she'll get even
better as you continue to use her
Crotona is easily one of the coolest new
features of Windows 10 so here's a
couple of ways to get more out of
Microsoft's personal assistant now
probably the best way to activate
Cortana is by using your voice you can
just say hey Cortana and that will
activate our instantly while Crotona
works while using your voice you'll also
be able to type out your search query in
the Start menu now of course typing can
be a bit of a hassle but thankfully
Cortana is pretty good at understanding
natural language she'll be able to
answer follow-up questions and she'll
even talk to you if you're feeling
lonely for example you're writing an
email and want to quickly check your
schedule you can simply just activate
Crotona using your voice and ask her
what your schedule looks like while
continuing to write your email Crotona
is also great at offering personalized
information based on what it knows about
you it can pull things up like the local
weather your schedule the status of your
flight and even tell you how long it
will take you to get to a certain place
you can simply ask Cortana what the
weather is for today and should be able
to figure out where you are without
explicitly saying your exact location if
you're using Microsoft's built-in
calendar app you can ask Cortana what
you have going on for today or what's
going on this weekend and she'll be able
to tell you what your schedule looks
like instantly this is especially handy
when you're busy and you want to quickly
figure out what's on your schedule you
can also manage your time much better by
creating reminders alarms and events
with Cortana you'll be able to create an
appointment instantly if you're using
Microsoft's calendar app you can simply
tell Cortana to create a meeting
tomorrow at 12 p.m. and Crotona will add
that to your calendar you can also tell
Cortana to move your appointments by
saying something like move my meeting
tomorrow to 3 p.m. and she'll be able to
figure out what event you're talking
about setting an alarm is also very easy
you can ask Cortana to set an alarm and
she'll create it right away you can also
ask her to show you a list of your
alarms where you can easily change your
alarms and clocks asking Cortana to
create reminders events and alarms make
it super easy to stay on top of what
your
without the need to leave the app you're
currently in if you want to quickly find
basic information you can ask your ton
of things like how tall is Taylor Swift
which we'll pull up right in the Start
menu you can also ask Ratana how long a
certain movie is like trainwreck for
example define a certain word and she
can even convert u.s. dollars to euros
instantly if you're looking for a way to
quickly get answers without having to
fumble around with different apps asking
Cortana is one of the best ways to
quickly find simple answers you can also
use Cortana the search online using Bing
for example you can ask her to show you
popular restaurants that are nearby and
she'll be able to pull up that
information via web search instead of
having it pop up in your Start menu you
can also use Cortana to run a Bing image
search for just about anything so if
you're looking to cheer someone up ask
her to pull up images of cute cats
