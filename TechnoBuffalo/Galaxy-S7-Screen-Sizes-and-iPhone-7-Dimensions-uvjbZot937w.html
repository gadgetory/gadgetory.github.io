Sangin from TechnoBuffalo and on today's
episode of rumor roundup will be talking
about amazon's next tablet Samsung's
Galaxy s7 so nice Xperia z5 and Apple's
iPhone 7 this is rumor roundup let's go
ahead and get started
Amazon already offers some impressively
cheap tablets with its Fire HD series
but the company could go even further
this holiday season a new report claims
Amazon will offer a new six inch slate
for just fifty dollars that's half the
price of the current Fire HD six
according to The Wall Street Journal
Amazon has struggled to win customers
over with its high-end tablets and
response the company is planning an
entire new lineup of cheaper models
including eight and 10 inch models as
well as the smaller 6 inch device
undercutting the competition with a new
$50 option could boost sales but it may
come with some drawbacks the upcoming
tablet will apparently offer a single
mono speaker instead of the standard
stereo setup it might also pack an
outdated display a weaker battery and
less durable design in an effort to cut
costs we're still curious to see these
new tablets in action if Amazon can turn
to fire HD into a disposable device it
might have a hit on its hands we can
even see picking one up at the airport
using it on the plane and then ditching
it in a recycling bin soon afterwards
for $50 this almost seems like a
reasonable idea sony just unveiled three
awesome new smartphones at IFA last week
but the company may already have plans
for its next big thing a new rumor
claims that Sony could announce a
super-sized Xperia z5 ultra early next
year with some pretty crazy hardware
according to leaked slide Xperia z5
ultra will pack a massive 6.44 inch
display with a 4k resolution which makes
a lot more sense than that it does on
the 5.5 inch Xperia z5 premium but we're
still not sold on the 4k smartphones in
general the rumored device could also
sport a Snapdragon 820 chip and four
gigabytes of RAM don't expect the Xperia
z5 Ultra anytime soon though
the new phablet apparently won't launch
until March 2016 suggesting it could
debut at Mobile World Congress in late
February of course it's possible Sony
could change its mind long before then
and tweaked or scrapped the device
altogether in the meantime we're looking
forward to spending more time with the
new Xperia z5 lineup if Sony does show
up with a super-sized z5 ultra early
next year we'll be happy to check it out
too though for most people a six-point
for 4-inch smartphone is probably way
too big Samson probably won't and Vail
the galaxy s7 until next year but the
company may take an unusual approach
when it does a new report claims the
flagship Android phone will ship in two
sizes similar to the iPhone 6 and 6 plus
of course Apple isn't the only company
offering two or more new smart phones
with similar specs in different sizes
Sony uses the same strategy with its
flagship Xperia Z line up but Samsung's
alleged plans seems to follow Apple's
lead pretty closely
according to Asia today the galaxy s7
will come in 5.2 and 5.7 inch variants
the new devices will also reportedly
offer some upgraded hardware including a
Snapdragon 820 chip four gigabytes of
RAM a 16 megapixel camera and a quad HD
display it's unclear what this means for
a Samsung Edge series the galaxy s7
might not come with a curved screen
variant at all though an edge device
could still show up later in the year
when the new know typically debuts then
again the company could also push its
edge design even harder by removing all
other options though that seems unlikely
for now Samsung typically unveils its
new flagship phone at Mobile World
Congress in late February or early March
though it's possible the company could
push the galaxy s7 up by a month like it
did with a galaxy note 5 either way
there's still plenty of time before we
get to see what's already shaping up to
be a new powerful device Apple's iPhone
6s event was probably their biggest
keynote today but analysts already have
one eye on next year's refresh according
to one analysts iPhone 7 will come with
a brand new form factor that's as thin
as the iPod Touch KGI analyst Ming Chico
expects the devices to be Apple's
slimmest smartphone to date measuring
between six millimeters and six point
five millimeters thin that means the
iPhone 7 could be almost one millimetre
thinner than the existing iPhone 6 which
is already one of the slimmest
smartphones on the market it's still
unclear what kind of impact this form
factor would have on battery life Apple
would presumably need to make its
battery slimmer though this could mean
our iPhones won't last as long in
between charges the iPhone 7 is still
more than a year away and Apple's plans
will almost certainly be revised before
then in the meantime let's focus on the
new iPhone 6s and 6s plus that was just
announced
