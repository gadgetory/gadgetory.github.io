jure from TechnoBuffalo here and I've
got what I think is the beauty queen of
Samsung's recent lineup if you couldn't
tell it is the galaxy s6 edge+ it might
be a mouthful but you are getting a lot
for your words I think with this guy but
time will tell to get to our testing so
we have the gold version it's also
available in a prequel black boxes in
line with current Samsung generation
devices it's just gray with some specs
on the back but my friends even have to
worry about reading sit back relax have
a drink and I will walk you through what
it's like to open up the box and as I
open that up it just turned on so push
it off to the side for a real quick
second really just save me the effort of
pushing the button inside we've got a
QuickStart guide for getting started not
slowly
there it is Quick Start Guide fun we've
got a sim removal tool for but you know
what that's for inside the box similar
to what we've got actually almost
identical to what we have in the box for
the note 5 we've got a wall wart and
this one obviously is not going to work
in the US but it is quick charge enabled
got a micro USB cable no USB see here
and there really nice pair of headphones
that come in a little plastic carrying
case with different size your gel
depending on your ear size and inline
controls for that as well but
accessories I'm just willing to bet are
not while you while you are here here is
the reason why you've watched this video
this is the galaxy s6 edge+ I'm going to
try and do a magic trick and get it out
of the plastic in one shot ah almost had
it
and there she is all done up in a
beautiful gold the phone feels really
nice in the hand a lot of people had
issues with the s6 edge without holding
it sort of the sides were almost too
sharp to hold looks like that's been
fixed almost a little bit wider here on
the edge plus feels really nice
so it's yelling at me let me turn it on
and let me run through all the specs so
obviously the screen I think is a main
story here and it curves from edge to
edge spec respect is almost exactly the
same as a note 5 save for the curve and
the lack of an S Pen but it is a 5.7
inch 2560 by 1440 screen
math very quickly you will know that is
a 515 PPI at Samsung Super AMOLED
displays I think they do an incredible
job with displaying some of the best
industry so I expected this to keep in
line with that it is running TouchWiz
that our modern UI but it's a much
lighter version as you can see it's
based on android 5.1.1 this I think is
international phone so no care your
branding on it so also no care your
bloatware so that's nice just Samsung's
own stuff and there still is a lot of
Samsung stuff on here powering this guy
is just a ridiculously powerful Exynos
7420 octa-core and an insane amount of
RAM I seem to be saying it's more phones
but it's got four gigs of ram that that
seems like a lot this phone should never
be slow no matter what you are doing
with it
storage this is where some people might
have issue available in 32 or 64 but
polar synced yourself who cares I can
afford a microSD card
and tu I say no no microSD card for you
this does not support expandable storage
in order to support removable battery so
if you want that and you want a bigger
form factor you need to go pick up the
Galaxy Note 4 because that's the last
gen device that will offer that the
battery though is 3000 milliamp hours
it's PMA and she enabled so you can
charge it on pretty much any wireless
charging surface it's got cameras as you
could probably expect that gold is so
pretty in person 16 megapixel sensor on
the back five megapixel sensor at living
right there on the front NFC is here I
figure I'd say that now a little bit
thinner than the note 5 this is seventy
five point eight millimeters or two
point nine eight inches whereas the note
five seventy six point one millimeters
or three inches we're into a full
comparison two devices to so you can see
the difference now walking along the
side we've got the volume buttons up and
down on the right-hand side got your
power button hello there power button on
the top SIM card you can see the antenna
bands and noise cancelling mic on the
bottom this is where your S Pen is not
not going to live you've got your data
firing speakers
you've got your micro USB noise
cancelling mic 3.5 million headset jack
and more antenna bands I'll take a real
quick look here at the UI and jump on
two apps will go into settings about
phone and I'll just make sure this is
5.1.1 which it certainly should be I'll
go into software info and yes 5 1.1 on
the bottom here that home button also
doubles as a fingerprint sensor and it's
flanked on the left and right by a back
button a multitasking button so you can
see what that looks like and swipe all
that stuff off to the side one thing I
should also note about the UI that's
only available on the edge plus you
swipe that out get that right I get to
your people edge this is where you can
set different contacts and you can dial
in very quickly if you turn the phone
upside down it actually will glow
different colors of the purse that's
calling you anyway lets tell me you guys
want us to see with this device we're
going to run it through a ton of tests
including my things gonna be interesting
battery I know there's some nerves with
a three thousand million power battery
will test quick charging will test speed
performance camera will also test you
know just how good the phone is in
general and we guys let me know what
else you wanted to see in tests until
next time Jon render from TechnoBuffalo
guys next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
