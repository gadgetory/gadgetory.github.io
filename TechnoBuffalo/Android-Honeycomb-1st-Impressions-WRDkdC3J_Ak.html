from TechnoBuffalo here I've had the
Xoom tablet now for just about a day and
I want to give you some overview and
impressions about Android 3.0 honeycomb
so let's go ahead and get started all
right so this is not going to be a
review of honeycomb mighty stretch the
imagination I've only had the tablet for
a day less than 24 hours which is
certainly not enough time for a review
but what I would like to give are some
first impressions of the tablet itself
and honeycomb in general so I think that
there are two very unique and different
target demographics they're gonna be
considering the zoom and any other
honeycomb tablet first I think it's
those folks that are going to walk it to
Best Buy walk into the Verizon store or
whatever their local retailer is and ask
for a tablet they may be sold on an
Android tablet that may be looking at an
iPad but it's definitely a demographic
that people are going to look for the
casual tablet users who have no affinity
for Apple or Android just looking for
something to use while they sit on the
couch the other market I think this is
going to be is the very Pro Android
folks those that are very familiar with
previous versions of Android operating
system maybe play around the SDK here on
honeycomb 300 or into the tweaking and
the hacking or have a very strong
feeling towards Apple all right the
reality is that a lot of people that
vote to go for an Android device a lot
of time that's a vote against Apple and
same thing goes the other way a lot of
people that are looking to get Apple
devices a vote against Android take
those two demographics those that really
have no affinity one way or another
towards Apple or Android and they're
looking for a good tablet and then those
that feel very strongly and that are
involved in Android community so let's
start with the former of those
communities those that are just looking
to pick up a tablet in general and a
honeycomb tablet what they're looking
for
well I will say that there's definitely
a steep learning curve here with Android
3.0 it's a bit different than previous
version of Android you see in the past
the first difficulty thing I've had to
and still am sort of struggling with is
a no physical home button that's
something that I've gotten used to on
pretty much all of my device
at least the tablet devices so we've got
a soft home button now for someone
that's familiar and using an iPad it's
going to be a bit different however for
the people that were talking about who
maybe you've never picked up a tablet
this probably won't be as big of
learning curve and as a different
feeling as it is for me the home button
resides in the bottom left hand corner
and the nice thing is it's always in the
bottom left hand corner no matter what
app you're in or whether orientation you
have it in its gonna realign itself and
always be in that bottom left-hand
corner which does make things quite nice
and so sort of keeping online that steep
learning curve there are a lot of things
that this tablet can do and this thing
can do a ton but they're not overly and
readily apparent but you look at
something about the iPad which certainly
this is going to be cross shopped with
there's something to be said for its
simplicity it's very easy to use to pick
up and just do now while the zoom may do
much more you definitely need to spend
some more time with it to learn how to
use those features so for example things
like these notifications down here are
very handy to learn know how to use you
can see some messages and emails that
I've got but you may not know how to
work those right away app to the top and
go ahead and click you go ahead and view
apps and view more apps if you have and
then hit the home button down at the
bottom if you use the editor in the past
you're certainly gonna know that you can
serve hold and tap down and get access
to all your wallpapers and widgets and
that stuff but again it may be a bit
confusing to sort of the lay user who's
just trying to learn how to use a new
tablet now I think that the learning
curve here is probably going to be not
relatively long about two days actually
I gave the tablet to my wife to try
yesterday when he first brought it home
now she's an iPhone user and she was
able to pick up the tablet and learn how
to use it with a bit of difficulty but
after about 10 minutes of playing with
it she was starting to haul through it
was just different than what she was
used to so let's go ahead and sort of
keep talking about some of the the other
demographics those that are very used to
Android so this is a different Android
experience some things are fundamentally
the same you hold down an icon you can
move it and delete it although now the
remove buttons in the upper right hand
corner same way to act as widgets and
wallpaper
you go ahead and hold it down as I show
it you can scroll through a ton of
different choices and you can move along
here through app shortcuts wallpapers
and such to sort of continue what you
know the marketplace has been redesigned
here for tablet unfortunately there
aren't that many tablet apps available
presumably that will change go ahead and
show you what's there Android apps for
tablets there we go so it does take a
little bit to load there aren't that
many here I think we've got what you
know 15 apps or so at least two right
now but there are many more that will
presumably will be coming so if you get
if you are familiar with Android is
gonna be a very familiar experience for
you one of the things that I really do
like though are the widgets that appear
it's nice to go ahead and check my email
I can see my calendar I can go ahead and
access my bookmarks and there a ton of
other widget choices that are here it's
going take a look at some of them the
one knock that I have on this is a lot
of the applications actually don't work
with Android 3.0 even though they are
well it's pretty much supposed to if the
developers haven't updated it to be
compatible you may have some
compatibility issues that's something
that we'll see addressed certainly as
Android 3.0 matures go ahead and move
that icon down i'm stickler to make sure
things are in order
so in conclusion in my first impressions
of honeycomb it's a very full-featured
operating system it works very well but
it's gonna take you a little bit longer
to get used to it but not familiar with
Android X our fluid Android there's
nothing gonna be a little bit of a
learning curve but not as steep I'm
starting to really enjoy using the zoom
on I think it could potentially be my
tablet of choice so I'm gonna go ahead
and continue to use it play around that
now I'll give you guys some more
features no reviews is I feel more
comfortable with it and feel prepared to
offer a review at a comparison so guys
want to know what you think as a zoom
for you not for you to be waiting for
the iPad 2 waiting for another Android
Honeycomb tablet coming out i'm john
retinue from TechnoBuffalo i'll see in
the next video but mine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
