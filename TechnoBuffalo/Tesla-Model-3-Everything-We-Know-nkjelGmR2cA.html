to you by Full Sail University what's
going on everyone John render from
TechnoBuffalo here and it's time to talk
everyone's favorite technology company
Tesla we are on the verge of seeing
their model 3 it's been rumored for
years it's been tweeted about by
executives for a very long time but the
day of reckoning is almost upon us when
we learn what the model 3 is going to be
about let me tell you everything that we
know and this is not based on conjecture
this is facts from either the CTO or the
CEOs mouth so the big deal about the
model 3 things to know it's Tesla's more
affordable car $35,000 before incentives
depending on what state you live on
obviously full electric with a range of
200 miles this is a mass-market car
meant for everybody depending on what
state you live and you could have almost
ten thousand dollars taken off that
price so you could get in the car for as
low as $25,000 from a size standpoint
Elon Musk described it as a competitor
to the 3-series and more recently
described as competitor to the Audi a4
so a smaller sedan said it'll take cubes
from the Model S and the Model X it
you've seen the two of those look very
different and speaking of the Model S
and the Model X the model 3 wasn't
always called the model 3 additionally
going to be called the model II but
forward on the patents and I think tests
also didn't want a Model S model II and
a model X well people do say they're
sexy company so about the technology is
going into the car this week CTO JB
Straubel said it's going to feature the
next-generation technology from Tesla
whether that means battery technology
next generation autopilot or super
charging technology we don't know Tesla
has been one of the early pioneers is
getting it to market of self-driving
technology is close to autonomous as we
can get that autopilot if you haven't
tried it or seen it is ridiculously
awesome they had to tone it down so much
people were just kind of falling asleep
in the car or just taking videos of the
car driving themselves obviously though
with the lesser priced car sometime
technology might not make it
few things we don't know if super
charging is gonna be enabled that's what
currently has room for projects
recording technology that charges their
car super fast essentially you get
eighty percent charge on about an eighty
five ninety kilowatt hour battery in
twenty
so I come at a kilowatt-hour battery on
a smaller pack it's probably gonna be in
the 45 to 50 kilowatt hour range you can
charge the whole thing up and probably
less I take you to run into the bathroom
do your business clean yourself up and
come back out to the car question I had
though is how can Tesla essentially a
small start from Silicon Valley doing
other car manufacturers I haven't been
able to do yet General Motors has the
bolts with the B not a lot of V coming
out relatively soon which has that same
200 mile range and she looks and those
look to be a pretty competitive car or
the Model S is different though is
Tesla's backing the super charging
technology behind it
Tesla's building their own with their
calling Giga factory to get the cost per
kilowatt of lithium ion battery downs
how his cars gonna be able to come to
market at such a low price couple like
GM can afford to take a loss on the car
can build the bolt at a lesser price
they can sell it for Tesla can't take
that risk so presumably each car will
come at a profit for the company so we
should see the car sometime this month
March 2016 but Elon must have even said
that maybe we won't see the entire car
may be able to show the butt-end are
able to show the front ends will see
something come in March as well as
information on pre-ordering this thing
which is due to it the roads towards the
end of 2017
but Tesla's history of delays with the
Model X is any indication probably would
hold your breath until 2018 or even 2019
and what do you guys think about the
model for you excited are you waiting
for this car it's sort of a more
affordable car for the mass-market
what are your thoughts I leave in the
comments located where my gentlemen
parts are I'll see you guys next video
we spent the whole video talking about
cool tech that's coming out what about
some cool tech you can make the folks at
Full Sail University have you covered
you've been thinking about a new career
full sale has an undergraduate degree
for you if maybe you want to get into
creating mobile applications you got the
idea for the next snapchat Instagram or
Facebook undergraduate degree program
for you find a new career find a way to
better your career already in go to Full
