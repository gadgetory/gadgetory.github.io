TechnoBuffalo here and we are taking a
look at the revival of the macbook line
completely redone for its 2015
incarnation this thing is incredibly
light coming in at just about two pounds
the width of the computer itself is
really dictated by the keyboard which
now goes completely edge-to-edge the
screen you've got now is a Retina
display so really high resolution a lot
of talk was went into the touchpad here
so if you interesting things here first
it now has the taptic engine inside of
it so you can actually can feel with
vibrations as you would need to if you
wanted to click something you feel it so
as I fast forward here I can actually
feel it vibrate inside and speaking of
pressing I can actually sense how hard
or soft you're pressing and do different
actions accordingly when the big story
is here is also on the side that's
single a USB type-c now does absolutely
everything with an adapter from charging
to data and everything else that you
would do with a portrait you've got a
speaker grille flanked here across the
top you got MacBook logo on a close to
bezel list design closing this thing up
that's going to be available in the
denounced famous three colors of a space
grey silver and gold we got the space
right here this thing is absolutely tiny
and miniscule walking around it you got
the little lever to lift it up nothing
on the left hand side say for that
single port on the opposite side you've
got three point five millimeter headset
jack and then just the feets on the
bottom
really incredible and really light here
go ahead and open it up and get a sense
of what this is going to look like also
going to talk about the keyboard how
they now use a new butterfly design and
say I'd n8 the keys it feels very nice
there's not much throw as you go through
and n-type so you're not going to have
that huge feed I hope used to on a
larger keyboard we still do get that
sort of satisfying click and it feels
almost more mechanical than you've
gotten before on typical laptop
keyboards gonna be available at April
10th starting at $12.99 powered by an
Intel Core M processor eight gigs of ram
into 56 gigs internal you can up the
storage to 512 and I'm the processor
