Oh after most important reason we use
our phones but really there's just too
many apps out there to help find the
best ones you want for certain things we
don't do that many app around up sternal
Buffalo I see really save them when I've
got stuff that I really enjoy using so I
have five apps that I am using right now
and if you guys liked this video let us
know down below give the thumbs up and
we'll do more because when I could pause
the list it was like 10 to 12 long
without a condensed it to my top of 5
let's start with keeping yo stuff safe
privacy comm sponsored this video but I
would have included them anyway I had a
credit card stolen about a month and a
half ago and someone used it to buy not
one but two gigantic closet-sized meat
lockers in Montana which clearly I did
not I did not do so I've actually been
using them for a while it's an app for
iOS or Android also has a chrome plug-in
but you gain full control over your
credit cards so the first thing that I
like about it lets you create
essentially burner cards and fake
addresses they're going to put in your
billing address and give a credit card
number to a site that maybe isn't that
reputable you put information to that
you look at your browser's you'll see a
little locket symbol out there but
doesn't always mean information is going
to be secure some people will see that
and I can always get out reason I like
privacy calm you can control the cards
that are being used you can freeze cards
you can totally delete cards if you want
it just works really well after I bought
two neat lockers I decided I want to
sort of preserve my identity and most of
the purchasing I do is online so privacy
has been an awesome tool for me just
give you control over your credit card
information and who's going to be it
I'll use the apps generally to monitor
the cards that usually most of my buying
is done in Chrome so use a Chrome
extension for almost everything you want
to keep your stuff safe check it out
it's free to sign up they are sponsored
but it's also a really useful app to use
so check it out so next one it's a
freemium model for iOS or Android I
haven't paid for it I just I don't mind
looking at the ad on it but it's the
face app and this one we had probably
more fun than we should have in the
office you take a picture of someone
they could not smile and use the app you
can make them smile you can make them
look young old change their sex from
male to female or vice versa if you want
to know you look like it's a lady
whatever reason it's a fun app
try one Oh your friends look like a
different gender it's really fun after
to play around with so I get a lot of
questions on what we use to record our
screens on Android on iOS now built into
iOS 11 on Android I use an app called AZ
screen recorder it's totally free it's
probably cos something for our loss and
features are lets you control everything
you control the resolution of the screen
recording you can control the frames per
second giving turn on the front facing
camera actually see your face while
you're recording you can do taps on the
screen to show your touching you can
show anything for recording your Android
device no route required to download it
from the App Store so if you want to do
YouTube videos just want to like show
your mom how to check your email it's a
great app to try totally free and I
guess worth every time and speaking of
email this is my favorite app that I use
all the time on iOS and it's now on
Android easily dot dues email app it
just it just called email I absolutely
love it it works just as well on Android
it did on iOS the reason I like it so
much so that's probably really nice
customizable UI you can actually see a
subscriptions that you are signed up to
your email and unsubscribe right through
the app I think you will be shocked at
how many hundreds of newsletters you uh
never Tinley subscribe to so I usually
go through once a week unsubscribe from
at 10 to 20 and it's cut my inbox down
tremendously really good app I recommend
it
it's great on iOS or Android so you've
got a lot of questions in our comments
now what kind of wallpapers we're using
we saw it on our galaxy s 8 videos and
in our one plus five videos most of the
wallpapers come from actually Google's
own wallpaper app this one is Android
only and you might not even know that
Google has their own wallpaper app they
do they change everyday you can update
it you get images from Google Earth just
look really awesome high-res images we
also got a ton of comments about our
thumbnail from our vs. video on the 1 +
5 or skelux yet 8 want to know if that
weather widget was that we used it comes
from the app weather timeline for
Android it's got a really nice widget
it's also kind of a nice weather app so
that was a like a two-for-one type deal
so you get you get wallpapers and
weather I'll I'll combine in one so
those are the top 5 apps I'm using way
more than anything else on my phone they
tried to take most that were
cross-platform we would give me the
comments if you guys asked us questions
down below of what apps we're using it
would recommend for certain thing we'll
notice it will do another video
if you want to see a follow up to this
at the other five that we didn't include
again leaving the comments down below
and let us know what apps are you using
what is your like two most favorite apps
leave the comments down below and I will
check them out give you a thumbs up we
appreciate it
till next time John around here from
