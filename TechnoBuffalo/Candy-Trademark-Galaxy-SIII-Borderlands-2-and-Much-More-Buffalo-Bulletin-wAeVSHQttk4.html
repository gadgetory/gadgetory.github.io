candy is apparently a real thing North
America's favorite samsung phone a new
Super Nintendo game gets released a
Borderlands to tweet snafu and a manned
mission to Mars by 2030 it's Buffalo
bullets in time hello internet and
welcome to the Buffalo bulletin where we
recap stories from our site
TechnoBuffalo calm every tuesday and
friday if you're interested in reading
more about any story on the show check
the description below for links or click
on the graphics if you have annotations
available in toggle on I'm Ashley sceva
here your top stories our first story of
the day is pretty much rage inducing for
anyone with common sense king.com the
developer behind candy crush saga
apparently filed for a trademark on the
word candy last februari with the US
Patent and Trademark Office and defying
all logic the USPTO approved the
trademark meaning King com now owns the
word candy without any specifics as to
its font style use color or anything
else porous King calm is already issuing
requests to other apps and social games
using the word and asking for some kind
of differentiation or explanation are
you kidding me with this more proof the
patent office is an absolute joke except
it's not even funny if you were to guess
which samsung phone was the most popular
in North America you'd probably guess
their current flagship the galaxy s4 but
according to a study by the chittock a--
ad network it's the galaxy s3 that's the
most popular and by a pretty significant
margin they say of all Samsung users
here in North America the sgs3 leads
with 33 point nine percent of users
while the sgs4 only grabs twenty three
point eight percent of the market
samsung surely wants these sgs3 users
upgrading but perhaps sgs3 users are so
happy with their phones they didn't feel
the need so we'll have to wait and see
who upgrades when the next galaxy s
phone launches in gaming a little bit of
a crazy blast from the past today a new
game has been released for the super
nintendo nightmare busters was an SNES
game in development back in 1994 that
never quite made it to retail shelves
and in 2007 the game hit the emulation
see in a now classic game rescue
super fighter team and nightmare busters
original copyright owners have released
a legit cartridge you can play on SNES
and Japanese Super Famicom if you're
ready to order the cart manual and box
will set you back 78 bucks and it'll
probably ship in the next few months out
some big-time dedication a little bit of
excitement this morning over on 2k games
Twitter feed it appears somebody tweeted
out the following Borderlands 2 is
coming to PS Vita on March 18th retweet
we've been patiently waiting for the
Vita port of Borderlands 2 so it seemed
pretty legitimate until 2k pulled a
tweet and said we apologize for a tweet
about a release date for Borderlands 2
on Vita which was posted an error the
release date mentioned is incorrect
whoops we'll have to wait and see if
that tweet was the correct date or if
the actual releases some time after
March 18th but I feel pretty bad for
whoever accidentally hit tweet this
morning on that one our grab bag story
takes us back to my favorite place space
mars specifically as a group of
assembled experts across government
industry and academic organizations
agreed that a nasa led manned mission to
mars could be feasible by the year 2030
unfortunately it would only be feasible
if NASA's budget was restored to its
former levels and a lot of people money
and technology would have to align to
make such a mission possible still
really exciting to think we might see an
astronaut set foot on the red planet in
our lifetime though and hopefully
everything and everyone necessary will
come together to make it happen that's
