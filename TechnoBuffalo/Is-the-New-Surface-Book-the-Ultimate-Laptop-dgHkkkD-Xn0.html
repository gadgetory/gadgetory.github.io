Microsoft to update the surface book
before you picked one up you are in luck
or at least at least I'm in luck
visually these guys look exactly the
same as a last gen meaning they've got
that same kind of cool hinge that rolls
out the same gap that's gonna let dust
and dirt get on that screen but it does
look really solid and I like to look of
last gen so I don't mind it stick around
for a little bit longer there's a lot of
new things here as well I seven
processors of course on board in fact in
the surface book it's called the surface
book i7 it also might be called a
surface book I said with performance
based doesn't seem like Microsoft's own
website is is really sure about that but
the performance base does add a lot of
things in it so on the math side a6 Gen
Intel Core i7 sono cabby like here
perhaps next year we now know what GPU
is going to be in there which is gonna
be nice so if you get any of the new
surface book i7 they're going to have
dedicated GPU remember last gen
Microsoft just didn't tell you a kind of
GPU was in there what we didn't know
that was it had one gig of ram now we've
got two gigs of dedicated ram for that
GPU and is the nvidia geforce gtx 960 5m
format and a lot of you're hoping for a
10 series in there but that is not the
case on the plus side though Microsoft
is say you can get up to 16 hours of
battery life and you should get double
the graphics prowess of the last gen so
that's a lot of extra performance the
same beautiful screen is there 13.5 inch
pixel sends display it's a 3000 by 2,000
resolution at 267 PPI the same 3.2
aspect ratios here so you hold it in
portrait it's gonna look like a sheet of
paper and actually looks really nice
when you take it out of the dock and use
it again surface book highlights you can
take off that screen use a tablet flip
it around or do whatever you'd like with
it if you're thinking maybe you just
want to pick up a performance bass and
drop in the screen from your lashing
surface book you are out of luck
Microsoft is not gonna sell it that way
and much like me a year later this gen
service book is this a tad bit heavier
and a tad bit thicker and if you want to
play game of guess a generation of
surface book the new one the keyboards
little bit set down farther than the
lash Jim other than that they look
almost identical going to be shipping in
early November pre-orders are available
it is not cheap starting at 20 399 and
going all the way up to 30 299 for an i7
and 16 gigs of ram and 1 terabytes of
SSD action I'm excited to test it
anything you guys want to know about the
surface book let us know down below and
we'll make sure we cover it when we do
our review but I can't wait to get my
hands on it and put it through its paces
the next time John Rhett enger' from
