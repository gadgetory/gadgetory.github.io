technobuffalo here and welcome dear
friend back to episode of ask the
Buffalo they don't know by now it was
the show where I put my fat butt on this
couch I answer your questions in the
world to technology we got a lot this
week's let's jump right in first
question comes from Ed Joel Figueroa 12
who asks at John for lakers thoughts on
jared leto as the joker and suicide
squad at comic-con this year we finally
got to see what Gary ladles going to
look like as the Joker and listen I was
as dubious as next person when the cast
scared let I was a joker in fact that
was as dubious when the cats Keith
ledger so when jared leto was cast as
the joker i was dubious is the next
comic book of love and fan but i was
equally as dubious when Heath Ledger was
cast the Joker coming right off of
brokeback mountain and obviously you'll
know he rocked the hell out of that role
but seeing a very different take on the
joker that let i was doing with the
tattoos and the freaky teeth and the
weird scary eyes I think it sounds like
he's got nailed I will say I became way
more excited for Suicide Squad after I
saw the trailer you haven't seen the
trailer and you want to see our recap of
it i'll put a link to it like in this
general region to check it out next
question comes from wicked for you to
see who asks at john for lakers what is
your wish list for the next iPhone I've
been saying this as my wishlist for the
next iPhone pretty much since like the
iphone 5 wireless charging please
wireless charging I figure it's like
somebody standing outside saying it's
gonna rain eventually you're going to be
right and on that day when it rains you
will be a genius so I'm saying wireless
charging although it's probably not
going to happen I think what we're going
to see is force touch improved camera
probably being able to record 4k
increased storage size getting rid of
that horrible 16 gig version i live in
rumors going to stick around but I got
faith that Apple is going to do the
right thing and knock that sucker out
make the 32 gig the entry-level model
others I don't think ready to see much
of difference would be improved rigidity
in the outside shell it's gonna look
almost identical we already know iOS 9
so all the stuff I wanted for that is
just I was 10 hopefully I think
definitely looking at an evolutionary
staff but I do think
that force touch is going to be a really
nice addition it's almost like adding
another button without having to add an
actual button to the next VV boo share
1988 ass at john for lakers i myself
have not had a pure Android device do
you think vendor skins improve the
experience to just add to fragmentation
a little bit of both I definitely think
it adds fragmentation in fact it
certainly does I'm of the school that I
would prefer as a consumer they have one
version android looks the same across
all devices but I get my companies are
making their own skins first of all it's
their revenue streams you can put ads in
there you can bundle app you have your
own app stores and things that alike so
I understand why they're in there from a
business standpoint from a user
standpoint I don't know how useful the
features are but certain they do add
more feature Samsung's added a ton more
than one Android actually does out of
the box for the user more not is kind of
up to you I do wish that Google would
say ok here is the layer of Android his
we built on top of it instead of make
your own version of Android and put that
on devices it's essentially with these
skins have become their own version of
Android and if Google would allow that
and somehow make that work and vendors
will cooperate gap skins it can be
download let's say you want to download
sense or you want to download you know
Samsung's custom UI you can do that as
well download the different UIs would be
awesome and consumers kachou that they
want you start at the naked version of
Android you add on top of it depending
on you your choice but we don't live in
an attic or and last but not least water
were there ass at john for lakers what
is one goal that you want to achieve the
most but you haven't yet uh that is a
good question i'm not be talking about
like business wise or personal wise from
business wise i sort of a pulled back to
layer on TechnoBuffalo and what we've
done i'd really like to get us to 10
million unique visitors a month not page
views that are probably translate to
thirty forty thousand page views per
month but 10 million uniques that means
10 million people came to the site
that's a big number for me i never get
that cut up in numbers the only just a
million subscribers and that was a huge
accomplishment but two million is always
better getting to 10 million uniques on
technobuffalo calm would be really
something i could could hang my hat on
and say like you know what we did it
we've arrived we're one of the larger
independent sides out there and that'll
make you feel like I've done something
personally my goal was always just to
have a loving family and I'm fortunate
up to have that like to travel more I'm
not the kind of guy that needs millions
and millions and millions and millions
of dollars Pappy if I only got a roof
over my head and food on my plate I'm
I'm pretty happy so my goals aren't like
monetary wise but I like to try and
maybe do more good in the world and try
and be more civically active I think I
think we could all be a little more
civically active you'll probably be my
goals on the I'm a simple man what about
you guys what do you what do you want to
do professionally and personally if you
could and I think you guys watching
episode of ask the Buffalo hope you
enjoyed until next time I am your friend
and dear host jon rettinger talk to you
guys next video I would like to film do
you think that maybe you could do the
opposite of what you're doing echo film
I'm going to revoke your invitation like
a vampire i'm going to say you're not
invited in my house anymore</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
