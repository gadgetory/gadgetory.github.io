letting me do what I love I'm geek i'ma
nerd whatever you want to call it I love
technology and you guys give me the
opportunity to get to do this for a
living and there's a way to say thank

kinds of fun stuff this time I am
teaming up with the folks at 80 mg to
give away two hot new phones actually

capability and the ability to talk and
surf at the same time so the folks at 18
key were nice enough to donate these
phones to help raise awareness for their
talk and surf campaign that they are
running on their Facebook page they'll
be a link down below which is ATT com
know and just att.com / facebook what
they're saying and asking you to do is
to try not using the talk and surf
feature so simultaneous voice and data
for 48 hours just to see if you can live
without it you know it's certainly a
pretty clear why than doing this
campaign gsm
so these currently can do simultaneous
voice and data where some evdo networks
have some difficulty so that is sort of
the awareness campaign that is going on

carriers I've had to make it us only so
cue the awe in the background and you
