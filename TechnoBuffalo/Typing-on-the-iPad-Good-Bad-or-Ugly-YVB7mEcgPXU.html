TechnoBuffalo here and I want to give
you a demonstration of the on-screen
keyboard found on the Apple iPad and
show you how easy or difficult it is to
type with a lot of productivity tools
like pages mail and even notes there are
a lot of reasons that you'd want to
infinite use to the amount of text so
let me show you how this works
we'll use notes for this demonstration
so in portrait mode you get a standard
keyboard looks very familiar to those
iPhone and iPod touch users and let's
see how easy it is all type of sentence
this is me typing on the iPad and see
how it works and I'll try and type both
fingers and typing like a full keyboard
so this is me typing on the iPad I made
a few mistakes with the autocorrect took
care of it now we'll try typing as I
would on a regular keyboard and I will
type a message
so this is me tip Iggy on the Apple iPad
you can see that it is sort of accurate
if you want to start touch type it's
quite easy because the keys are very
large if you want to type like a
standard keyboard in portrait mode you
may have some difficulty I've only had
to just a few hours so I think that's
something you'll get used to as use the
device now it also has a landscape
keyboard which I'll go ahead and show
you right now an apple is claiming that
this landscape keyboard is almost full
size so I've got a full size keeper here
for demonstration this is the Apple
wireless keyboard go ahead and put it on
top and you can see that well it's not
quite almost full-size it's decent size
to me a bigger than we've seen on the
iPhone or the iPod touch but there's
still a lot of room so let's go ahead
and try another sentence we'll go ahead
and type we'll do the typical typing
thing the quick brown fox jumped over
the lazy dog and I'll try and type it
normally as if this was a regular
keyboard
so the quick brown fox jumped over the
lazy dog pretty quick and pretty easy
and again for only having this for two
hours I can see this actually getting
easier and easier to use the more you
have it it's pretty accurate it's very
quick and a lot of people were wondering
today when on launch day about the
keyboard adapter whether then that was
going to come out and scrap the dock and
the keyboard Apple assay for its end of
the month but they also mention that you
can pick up Bluetooth keyboards such as
this one and pair it up and use it for
typing so you may not necessarily need
to wait for that to come out however
this looks to be a very usable and
really nice to type on keyboard I'm
actually very surprised about how easy
it was to type on the nine point seven
inch capacitive touchscreen is very
responsive and really typing like an
actual keyboard can be done so if you're
a student and you want to take notes in
class this may actually be a decent
option for you and it stay tuned to the
video word to the channel for a full
coverage two of the pages applications
see how typing works in a word document
or a Pages document and see what you can
customize or not customize anyway guys
in John Renton gherkin TechnoBuffalo be
sure to stay tuned to the channel and
TechnoBuffalo for all of your iPad
coverage anyway I will see you in the
next video bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
