maybe didn't want a video game console
it looked like a 1980s VCR or shoebox
from Costco Microsoft has your answer
meet the thin beautiful Xbox one s this
white console is now 40% smaller and
best of all got those power supply built
inside so that Xbox staple of gianormous
power brick is a thing of the past
aesthetics aside other updates here it's
gonna support 4k Ultra HD for blu-ray
movies and content streaming from apps
like Netflix and Amazon but no 4k for
gaming but don't be too bummed out HDR
has been added and that will work for
gaming as well as third-party streaming
apps you're probably asking yourself
when can I pick one of these consoles up
and the answer is going to be in stores
in August but you can pre-order now
there are kind of three different
versions available but really two in a
limited edition first you have a 500
gigabyte Xbox one s4 299 smackeroos a
one terabyte version which is probably
what I'd recommend for 349 and a super
special limited edition I don't know why
super special I should put a bigger hard
drive in it but it's got 2 terabytes and
be available in select markets for 399
dollars also with the Xbox one as a
stand so if you don't want your console
to sit horizontally you can prop it up
put next year TV the front of the
console now features a button to pair
your now bluetooth capable controller as
well as a USB port and if you're looking
around this thing for a port for your
Kinect you're gonna be disappointed you
now are going to need an adapter to
connect your connect via USB also
announcer Microsoft was the Xbox design
lab essentially it's like moto maker for
an Xbox controller you can pick from a
ton of different colors in fact there
are 8 million color variations to make
the controller of your choice and
speaking of controllers there's a little
bit of a tweak set up going to the
control of the Xbox 1s and new textures
and some updates to the control sticks
but not much else pretty much the same
except now you can pick from literally 8
million colors gonna be available for
$79.99 through Xbox comm / Xbox design
lab and if you fancy it you can also get
it laser engraved for additional 10
bucks what you guys think about the Xbox
one ass you excited it tell me a good
looking console is enough to make you
purchase a new Xbox one have you been
waiting to buy an Xbox one for one that
didn't look like a black box wanna hear
your thoughts I don't leave in the
comments down below and may
maybe just maybe let's say you want to
pick up a new Xbox one s and you want a
game with your friends and while you're
just rocking a game of destiny or maybe
the upcoming Halo Wars - which I'm
mildly excited about you come with a
business idea like o friend you live on
either side of the world we should
collaborate the folks at Atlassian have
you covered you can team up and manage
tasks and projects no matter how complex
with JIRA you can share content organize
results with confluence even video chat
each other or talk to each other with
HipChat and you can review the code for
that killer app as you're gonna create
with bitbucket check the folks at
Atlassian out its Atlassian comm atl
