Lakers calm here with an unboxing for
you of the Samsung eternity just sent
Amy from the PR firm it should be mine
for about two and a half weeks so I'm
looking forward to using it and letting
you guys know what I think let's go
ahead and get the unboxing it out the
box looks like there's a cart from the
PR firm holiday card wishing you a Happy
Holidays nice alright so here's the box
looks a little beat-up probably been
reviewed before but let's go ahead and
get to the unboxing so here it is
picture the device on the front it is a
full touchscreen device kind of cool
Samsung Eternity 3G because you can
watch TV on it GPS and it plays music
it's mate G&amp;amp;T information package
contents some legal mumbo jumbo AT&amp;amp;T
mobile TV that's what that means that's
pretty cool and nothing else so let's go
ahead and see what we got inside this is
not warm the 18th tee box that open up I
guess everything slides out of it
alright nothing else in there then right
off to the side Quick Start Gone Baby
this is a new phone I think it hasn't
been opened yet everything still sealed
Quick Start Guide probably never open
that AT&amp;amp;T eternity you know I'm not sure
if this is a smart consider a smart
phone or future phones I've never used
it I don't know if it has email or any
that capabilities on it
but I guess we will find out soon enough
here's the device itself put that down
for a minute and a charger which I
assume has that weird Samsung
proprietary port yes it does
it's like a real squished micro USB or
USB very big kind of annoying on its
proprietary
let's take a look at the phone here
sealed in package I don't know if this
has a SIM card in it or not but take a
look here it should be pretty nice got
em kind of metallic feel on the back
it's got a 3 megapixel camera I don't
know it was out of focus or not is 3G on
the front of the device you've got a
very large touchscreen it actually feels
capacitive does not feel like that
squishy resistive screen so that's nice
you have a send and button and a back
button on the left
we've got volume up and down also
appears there is a port for charging and
I guess they're just you have to buy a
separate dongle for headphones up nope
there's a headphone adapter on the other
side she just look before I said
anything
three-and-a-half millimeter headset jack
it looks like a camera key and a
programmable soft key on the top of the
device looks to be the power on and off
let's see if we can take off the back
and see how big the battery is here and
there is a SIM card in there that was
nice of them at least it's got an
account with it so I can use it or even
put in my own SIM card that I use with
my AT&amp;amp;T phone it's not the biggest
battery that Samsung's ever included but
it is in case you're wondering let's see
how many milliamp hours if it says on
there it is doesn't say how many
milliamp bars so sorry guys can't give
you an answer there I will look it up
there and tell you but it says 3.7 volts
lithium-ion don't have any milliamp hour
batteries that is but hopefully that's
good enough to get for a full day of 3G
pop the battery back in got a nice
actually plastic but it says a nice
butts how it feel to it they kind of
bang it you can hear that it's plastic
swing cover that back up alright back in
place it's like there's a watch TV on
the go thing here it's pull this off
it's like I am the first one to review
this device here I can't tell what's a
resistive or passive but it feels like
the iPhone screen not very squishy let's
turn it on see if it's got a charge
let's see
this looks like maybe dead no power
button is the end button alright
AT&amp;amp;T booting up that obnoxiously loud 3G
logo times being updated you can see
what time I'm filming this here
it's 953 California time at night and
looks like we're all good to go here so
I will review the device let you guys
know and I think it's got these cool
little widgets that pop out on the side
but more on that kind of as I get to use
the phone but looks to be a pretty nice
device so far but you guys know what I
think after a week or so anyway enjoy
