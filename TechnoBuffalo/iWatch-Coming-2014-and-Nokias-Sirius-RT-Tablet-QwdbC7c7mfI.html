to you by audible.com what's up everyone
welcome back the episode of rumor
roundup this the show where we catch you
up on all the crazy tech rumors that
happen each and every day on the
Internet of this week the iWatch might
have a launch date sometime in 2014
blackberry might be spinning BBM off
into its own company in the weird one of
the week nokia looks like getting ready
to release a Windows RT tablet I got a
lot to say about that this rumor roundup
let's get started let's start with the
big daddy of all rumors me i watch
wearable technology is coming whether
you like it or not at this point I see
very little reason for wearable stuff
but it looks like it will be here in
2014 4 199 bucks at least according to
one particular analyst an interview with
the commercial time CIMB securities
limited analyst weighing wanna laid out
what to expect from the Apple is next
year specifically he predicted that the
iWatch will launch in the second half of
2014 for a pretty surprising price of
one hundred ninety-nine bucks here's
what I think about that hundred
ninety-nine bucks the killer price point
for some good sermon electronics this
unnamed products got to bring something
new and fancy to the mix it can't just
be like a phone on my watch otherwise I
got one in my pockets got to do
something that nothing else can do right
now it's gotta be something that died
phone can't do I some that my tablet
wont do I don't know what that is yet
now moping Apple's got some crazy secret
they can show me that's gonna be a que
only a watch can do this crazy hologram
type thing I don't know what that's
gonna be it I've racked my brain to try
and find the value of you had a
SmartWatch and I've had a really really
hard time doing it but under 99 bucks I
might be willing to give it a shot
supposedly blackberry wants to spin BBM
off into its own subsidiary so what the
heck does that mean so let's just say
hypothetically the blackberry is a
little bit of financial trouble let's
say they even hemorrhaging market share
for the better part of about six years
let's say I pathetically again in the
2007 they've been losing market share
left and right now also hypothetically
let's say they're considering selling
the company and they're looking to a
potential buyer and say here's all the
assets we have
of BBM is worth so much a potential
buyer would say okay what is BBM
actually worth now Blackbird can make up
some crazy numbers no way to
substantiate what that number actually
is by spitting BBM off into its own
subsidiary they actually put a value on
that own company so it certainly would
be still under BlackBerry's umbrella but
it's another asset the blackberry after
looking to sell could say here's what we
have or perhaps it could even sell the
BBM messaging service to another
third-party but the very least it shows
value for black grey it's actually a
really a business decision similar to
what next flick tragedy with quick stir
earlier last year and you're like yeah
let's show you the part of its
profitable and spin the not profitable
stuff off somewhere else and don't look
at it in this case the not profitable
part I'm guessing is the hardware
business BBM certainly was the way to
communicate it I communicator the
friends BBM all the time but then came
whatsapp then came I message all kinds
of other ways to talk maybe I'm sort of
starting to go down and down and down
now blackberry said that it's going to
be coming to other platforms it should
be coming to Android sometime this
summer and iOS hopefully shortly after
that it would be more inherent value in
doing this so I get it it's actually
very good business sense when thorsten
heins if that's the guy who did he is
the head of blackberry or someone on
black bridge board of directors had a
brilliant idea I think this is a
precursor to a sale of the company I
think we'll probably see that sometime
in the next six to eight months
supposedly nokia is going to release a
Windows RT tablet you're getting deeper
and deeper in bed with Microsoft we're
gonna hear this see this tablet
supposedly on sep tember 26 so according
to sources speaking directly to the
verge this tablet supposedly dubbed
serious is going to look exactly like a
Lumia just larger so of a polycarbonate
back and probably come in bright colors
full HD display 6 megapixel rear camera
have a cute megapixel street around
front be powered by a pretty awesome
Snapdragon 800 chip 2 gigs of RAM
they're also claiming the device is
gonna have 10 hours of battery life
which is pretty solid will have LTE for
getting go data on when you're somewhere
else now what the hell nokia why what
windows are tears and selling at all
Microsoft's having a fire sale it's a
fledging platform windows 8 super solid
I get it make a Windows 8 tablet that
you can use for everything but an RT
tablet I don't care what it costs I
don't care how many commercials
Microsoft puts out this thing is not
going to sell you can't
cram it down people's throats it just
ain't gonna work I have no idea what
nokia's doing perhaps you're
contractually I'll begin to put this
thing out but I am guessing it is gonna
be put to pasture very very very quickly
if you're interested in this do not buy
it day one if you wait I'm guessing till
dig ten there'll be a fire sale where
will be one hundred and fifty dollars
off or whatever interesting I like
Windows 8 a lot but Windows 8/rt form
just does not make sense me my loan my
