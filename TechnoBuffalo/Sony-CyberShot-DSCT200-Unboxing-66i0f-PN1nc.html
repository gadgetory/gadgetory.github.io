non-apple unboxing for you I needed a
new digital camera my outgoing can and I
think was four and a half or five years
old and two megapixels didn't really cut
it anymore I'm going to a buddy's
wedding I wanted to take a new camera
with me needed one anyway so I picked up
a sony DSC T 200 I'm not gonna lie I
already opened it but I'll show you
what's inside the box what the camera
looks like if you guys are interested
some specs about the camera its 8.1
megapixels it's got a 5 times optical
zoom it's got a super steady shot and a
3.5 inch widescreen touch panel on the
back and it records a video in full 1080
and the battery is approximately 250
shots and it's got some face detecting
stuff in there and it's really thin too
so I'll show you guys the camera itself
definitely in the box to show just the
cameras and instructions and a charger
for it alright guys so here is the
camera itself
let me cyber-shot they said the 5 times
optical zoom get the reflection off of
it for you there we go you can see it's
a pretty thin camera here it is next to
the iPhone you can see just about us
then on the back it's got a
three-and-a-half inch touch panel all
the controls are done by this touch
panel I don't really learn how to use
the edge just picked up the camera a
couple hours ago to turn it on here
you're lucky back you just slide that
down slide that down turned it on and
that's it on the back you guys can see
it's all all touch control anyway guys
I'll use the camera and as usual let you
guys know what I think
but camera bad camera or what spin small
fit in my pocket no problem
anyway guys that's it thanks for
watching any questions about the camera
let me know thanks for subscribing and I
will talk to you guys soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
