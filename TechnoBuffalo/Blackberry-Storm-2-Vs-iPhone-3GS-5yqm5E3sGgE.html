round one of a head-to-head comparison
there's arguably the two hottest
smartphones out right now AT&amp;amp;T iPhone
3GS and Verizon Wireless is blackberry
storm2 this round is gonna cover screen
it's gonna cover scrolling it's gonna
cover browser it's gonna cover cut copy
and paste and it's gonna cover keyboard
let's go ahead and get started with the
screens the screen on the iPhone 3GS is
a capacitive screen it doesn't have any
sort of haptic feedback and the screen
doesn't do anything fancy other than
just accept the input from your fingers
so what it does have is multi-touch
capabilities meaning you can pinch and
zoom with two fingers I'm sure you've
seen with photos and pictures when you
put your finger on it the screen doesn't
move at all
it feels static when you click through
on the other hand the blackberry storm2
has a sure press screen it actually has
four sensors in each corner and as you
click you actually feel the screen go
ahead and click through it also has a
capacitive screen but it does not have
multi-touch so all your zooming is going
to be done either through a series of
taps or hitting proper zoom and zoom out
buttons now the shirt press is a very
interesting implementation I think that
it was done perhaps a little bit poorly
and hastily on the storm one but on the
storm 2 it's a fantastic implementation
you did the impression of actually
feeling like you're hitting a button and
you'll see how that comes into play when
we discussed the keyboard so I think
that if you have to discuss sort of head
to head and put these next to each other
it's gonna come down to what you prefer
whether you want the multi-touch
capabilities of the iPhone or whether
you like the clicky pseudo button feel
of the blackberry storm2 it's gonna come
down to personal preference and before I
get any further with this hat debt
comparison let me preface this was
saying that I am an iPhone user I've
used an iPhone since the first one came
out but I definitely see the merits of
DeStorm - so I'm going to try and
this is impartial a comparison as
possible so next let's cover scrolling
scrolling on the storm one was not
necessarily the smoothest process didn't
have the most advanced physics engine so
you flick your finger to scroll through
it wouldn't keep going it would stop at
a finite amount so let's see if that has
been fixed on the storm to go into
contact is probably the best way to do
that right here and as you see now when
you scroll it is quite smooth and keeps
moving depending on how quickly you
scroll very smooth and very easy to
select and as you put your finger over
something you can select it and then you
push in to actually open it up take a
look at the same contact screen on the
iPhone 3GS it is also sort of very
smooth affair it's different looking
menu system but both go very quickly and
nice and easy this one's got to be a
drop between the two it's going to
depend again on what you prefer so next
let's check out browser and a lot of
people are going to want to use these
obviously for their browsers the storm 2
is equipped with Wi-Fi as is the iPhone
3GS both our 3G devices the iPhone
riding on AT&amp;amp;T
it's a HSDPA network and the storm tubes
running on Verizon's EVDO Rev a 3G
network so let's test the browser speeds
of both of these so the first round of
tests is going to be conducted over
Wi-Fi so we're gonna see the speed over
a pretty strong Wi-Fi network we're
gonna load my YouTube page youtube.com
slash John poor Lakers this has been
loaded on both devices before so to
simulate visiting a page that you go to
on a regular basis let's go ahead and
try and hit go at the same time on both
of these which is harder than it looks
ok and both of them are off
it's like the iphone 3gs loaded a little
bit quicker but the storm - storm back
so to speak I think both are the iPhone
is just about it is done now and the
storm is just finishing up so while the
storm is still finishing let's talk
about navigation and how the iPhone
handles browsing so you can scroll
through with one finger and you get a
very smooth scrolling as you go through
you don't get that checkerboard pattern
with the page loading it's very quick
zooming is accomplished via one of two
ways either you can double tap it'll
zoom in on particular area you can
double tap to zoom out or you can use
the multi-touch capabilities and take
two fingers and zoom in anywhere you
like both don't support flash and as of
right now neither have browsers that are
going to support flash so you can see
it's relatively smooth let's say elegant
experience on the Mobile Safari on the
iPhone 3GS moving over to the storm - if
I scroll along also I don't get that
checkerboard pattern it's got a very
quick load speed and the processor seems
to be handling things nicely if I want
to zoom in I can do it one of two ways I
can also double tap and the screen flash
from zoomed in I do not have to actually
click the screen in it just a quick
double tap and I can double tap again to
zoom in a little bit more now zooming is
also done via these two magnifying
glasses either in or out and you just
sort of hit it and you zoom in or out
you don't have any multi-touch
capabilities on the browser you can move
it around but you're not going to be
able to sort of pinch and zoom
unfortunately I do wish that these storm
2 hadn't touched capabilities I think
that's one area where the iPhone really
shines I think that this round definite
has to go to the iPhone all the storm 2
has a very capable browser which does
seem to be world's better than what was
found on
the first storm so browsing is about
most importance too I think the iPhone
is definitely going to be a better way
to go let's go ahead and exit Havanese
and let's continue with cut copy and
paste it was a big sticking point the
first iPhone that it didn't have to cut
copy and paste blackberry is sort of
always had it but there's a new
implementation that's in place with the
storm - let me show you how both this
works we're going to open up notes
application on the iPhone I'll go ahead
and go into a new note here so now I've
got some text on an iPhone application
this will work in SMS it will work on a
web page it'll really work anywhere
where this text if you want to cut copy
face you take one finger select the text
that you want that little magnified
glass pops up you let go I could hit
select select all or paste let's select
and I get these two little blue bars
that I can move along to select the text
that I want once I have it selected I
can hit copy try to paste it you just
select again and you hit the paste
button very quick and very easy we'll
move over here to the blackberry storm2
and I'll show you how cut copy and paste
works for this I'm gonna open up a
message and here's a message from
blackberry telling me about my
registration we'll use this one for
demonstration purposes so what you do
here is you actually take two fingers
and you click down on the device and you
get these two or very similar-looking
notification icons and you can move it
around to just where you want hit the
button down below hit cut and I wanted
to paste it I would just hit the paste
button same implementation and I'd go to
where I want and the icon on the Left
would be different I might be surprised
at how easy it is to cut copy and paste
on the blackberry that was something
that was very difficult to do I think
that they really put in a successful
implementation of it so I think that
this is definitely a draw depending on
which one you are going to prefer so the
next and final round of the stack
Tech comparison our keyboards now both
first-generation devices had drawbacks
to their keyboards the iPhone first and
actually accepted generation didn't have
a landscape keyboard and the storm once
keyboard was looking for he used it not
very accurate the sure press technology
that was there on the first generation
it wasn't very good
it only had one sensor in the middle he
had to wait quite a while for the screen
to reset and then come back up and if
you're trying to type numbers that or
letters are in the corners of the screen
really weren't gonna have any accuracy
whatsoever but that's the rectified on
both of us isn't let's see how it works
we're gonna open up a notepad and I'll
open up a new note now again I am an
iPhone user and I have been one for
three years so I'm probably gonna be a
little bit more proficient at the
iPhones keyboard than I am at the storms
but I will again keep this impartial so
I've got a portrait keyboard which of
course is simulated on the screen and I
can say move my finger around I can see
what each character is and if I turn the
device I get a landscape keyboard so
let's test the keyboard so you can see
how well it works and I'm just gonna
type very simply this is a test this is
the tests rotated over
you can see that there are some errors
look out a correction feature fix that
so I think that the keyboard on the
iPhone is very quick and pretty easy to
use let's go and take a look at the
storm and now with this new screen
technology with the four sensors see if
it's more accurate to type on so I'm
going to go ahead and open up a new
message
okay I've got a new email notification
here and I've got the sort of shirt
press keyboard that you've seen on the
pearl and pearl flip it's got two
letters perky and it does a sort of
autocorrect functionality and also we'll
learn as you type and as with the last
generating device generation device if
you turn it you also get a full
landscape keyboard now if you move your
finger over this you don't get the
letter that pops up but you get sort of
a blue glow lets you know where you are
and if you flip it back to the shirt
type keyboard you also get that same
sort of blue glow so let's do a test and
see how this works let's test the
landscape keyboard for first and in my
review of the storm one I really limited
about it how poor I thought the keyboard
was and almost unusable let's see if
that's been fixed on the storm - and
again I've only had this device for a
few days so your speed is that they're
going increase as you use it it's
getting wet come back hit the button on
the side I always do that let's try that
again three go this is a test and I did
that with 100% accuracy although it did
have to correct with the keyboard and
the phone recognize what I wanted to say
and it came through very quick and I
typed just as fast I have it on the
iPhone that I've had it for three years
so I'm very happy to report that the
keyboard on the storm 2 has been fixed
if you're holding out for a storm
because you couldn't stand the keyboard
on the first one put your fears to rest
it is hundreds of times better on the
second generation device let's take a
look at the shirt type key word and I
actually used to use a Perl and I was a
fan of the keyboard so let's try that
out
so that was again still pretty quick and
for not being a blackberry storm user I
picked it up relatively easily and I
think that as I used it I would only get
faster so keyboard to keyboard here I'm
almost inclined to give the keyboard to
the storm too because it's got that
clicking feeling to get the feeling of
pressing a button however I am gonna
call it a draw because I like the fact
that I know what letter I'm typing on
the iPhone how it pops up and it give me
a little bit more accuracy but this is
very very very close and is gonna come
down to personal preference but fools do
that again use a storm one you're gonna
know that this is so much better than
what you might be used to so stick
around a new future rounds we're gonna
cover email functionality and a ton of
other things but I wanted to sort of
give you a overview of how these two
devices stacked up and I think they
matched head-to-head very closely now
much closer than they did with the last
generation of hardware so that baby
iPhone 3G and the blackberry storm one
