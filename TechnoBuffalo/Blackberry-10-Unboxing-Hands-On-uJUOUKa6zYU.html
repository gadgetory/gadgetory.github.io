TechnoBuffalo i'm here at blackberry
world 2012 in orlando florida and we
have a blackberry 10 dev alpha device to
unbox for you quick look at the box not
a lot to show there's blackberry so yeah
I can get this open with one hand okay
here's the actual prototype device
itself it's called the blackberry 10 and
this has a case on take it off quick
blackberry 10 dev prototype device so
really you just see the logo right there
some basic ports on the side and top but
this isn't running blackberry 10 it's
running a watered-down version of
blackberry playbook 2 point 0
okay so now we're looking at what's
inside the box you've got the zoom tool
tray that's for popping out the SIM card
micro USB charging comes with this
rubber case although that blocks the
blackberry logo says I'm very fun and
then the safety and product information
and blackberry 10 dev alpha a guide to
the phone itself so pretty good hdmi
port headset jack notification LED micro
sim screen lock front facing camera all
the goods it's got a 4.3 inch screen
with a 1024 x 768 resolution and we'll
show you that just a sec all right here
we are with the device powering on it
actually wasn't charged we took out of
the box here so we just charged a little
bit so you can see you've got the hdmi
out there we've got micro USB 16
gigabytes onboard expandable storage 3.5
millimeter headphone jack a power button
volume on the right and the Alpha device
is booting up again it's a 4.3 inch
screen with a 1024 x 768 resolution and
on the top there you can see there's a
front-facing camera too it takes a bit
to boot up again this is just a dev
alpha device it's not running blackberry
10 and this is not final hardware it's a
just a device for developers to get
ready for blackberry 10 applications so
here you go just like in the photos I
showed there's not a whole lot going on
here I don't believe it makes phone
calls or even has a data connection but
it does have a browser and a camera and
the interface is very similar to what
you get on the blackberry playbook let's
shred open up the camera here you can
see it's swipe up and everything still
working so we'll go to the browser so
same kind of card in her face that we
had on the blackberry playbook again
this is like a watered down version of
playbook 2 point 0 now let me just put
this down at the Settings button
actual actually we're not going to show
that because we don't want to give away
a who's device this is but anyway that's
a quick look here at the first
blackberry 10 dev alpha device from rim
and this is Todd hazleton with
