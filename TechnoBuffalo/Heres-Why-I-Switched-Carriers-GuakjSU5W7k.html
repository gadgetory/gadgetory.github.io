from TechnoBuffalo I want to tell you
guys a bit of a story when we review
devices here at TechnoBuffalo we review
them on the carrier that they come with
so for it's an 18 18 t device will test
on AT&amp;amp;T Verizon t-mobile Sprint and all
the rest from about 2005 on I've used
AT&amp;amp;T is my primary carrier back then it
was singular it's been very easy to pop
out a SIM card and move over to another
phone it was just the easiest for me but
about eight months ago I decided to
start experiments where I would try
every carrier for a four month period I
still have to try sprint but I want to
share my experience with switching to
Verizon and switching to t-mobile I'm
not going to talk too much about how
fast networks be dark that's gonna be
totally subjective depending on where
you live but if you're debating
switching or thinking about what are the
Curie's might have to offer definitely
check this out
so going from eighteen t I first jumped
over to t-mobile a young carrier been
offering a ton of incredible deals
incentives free data for music streaming
I did their trial where I got to try and
iPhone to make sure it worked in my home
and worked in Braille so I went and I
got sort of sketchy service in my house
despite it showing full coverage on the
map you're gonna see that's a trend in
my home I think my walls must be lined
with lead
but t-mobile offers Wi-Fi calling so I
figured I'd be fine the t-mobile was the
first carrier that I went to and again
each of the carriers were used for four
months and Sprint's gonna be the next
one that I'm going to try I hooked up
Wi-Fi calling and it worked relatively
well but the problem was when I left my
house anytime there was a handoff from a
Wi-Fi to either LTE or 4G HSPA+ or even
3G the call would drop the call quality
on Wi-Fi Colin was also not what I would
call excellent very scratchy very
similar to the early days of cell phones
in fact I switched my wife my wife's
been with me on this journey so I keep
switching her with me she couldn't use
the phone I she had a really hard time
making phone calls and that's our
primary phones that we use they ran into
a bit of a problem we had to turn Wi-Fi
calling off and despite second I step
outdoors getting three to four bars of
LTE indoors I was lucky to get one
sometimes I would drop down to only
showing 3G service so I made using
t-mobile
very difficult for us at home so bear in
mind the Wi-Fi calling other people have
had very different experiences I tried
multiple devices as well with t-mobile
iOS and Android both make sure was just
unique to one device talk to you mobile
customer service which was absolutely
excellent tried to walk you through some
settings and how to tweak things and
still is never able to fix the problem
completely so if you're considering
t-mobile for Wi-Fi calling best advice I
can gate would be try the service first
make sure it's going to work for you and
try the Wi-Fi calling see if it's going
to fit I will say t-mobile data speeds
and getting subjective work incredibly
fast outdoors indoors Oh was another
story
Fazio go and go shopping for example
outside the store three to four bars of
LT incredibly fast data speeds inside
though that would drop down to 3G
connections sometimes not even that I
get the dreaded no service t-mobile
still is lagging behind getting through
those walls at wall penetration they
bought a huge chunk of band twelve but
not a lot of thumbs up that are
supporting at twelve bands hopefully the
next few months we'll start seeing more
phone support it and that wall
penetration should be something in the
past I think that's why t-mobile is
really pushing the Wi-Fi calling but for
us that did not work however having said
that when I was getting a strong LTE
service there volte which is voice over
LTE was absolutely incredible it sounded
really good it's hard to describe what
something sounds like but you can
audibly hear that it sounds different
than a normal call best example I can
give would be like seeing HD TV for the
first time universes standard def you
could see a difference I might be able
to describe it but it just sounds so
much better as able do simultaneous
voice and data which was also very nice
to have after the four months so I
decided I was going to try and go to
Verizon and I went to Verizon and I
brought my own hardware Verizon now you
could centrally do you could do with
t-mobile and AT&amp;amp;T swap SIM cards into a
new phone and you are good to go I
brought my own hardware with me to sign
up I had a few unlocked iPhones that I
used which will work with t-mobile 18 to
get Verizon not sprint which will I
haven't tried to print yet and it was
they they just didn't know what to do to
set up a new phone that didn't have an
IME items in their system which should
have been 15 minutes the pour-over
number
took a very long time in many call
sequester service what I ended up doing
essentially saying use an IMEI of a
phone you've got in your store just give
me the SIM card account that's all I
need I read in the forum's a way to get
around that is essentially just create a
new account online have them send you
SIM cards and then just port your number
over that will avoid all those problems
so on to Verizon again check the Verizon
map had great coverage by my house got
the phone in the house and same thing
happened I would drop from really strong
LTE to almost nothing one or two bars of
three Gina think about Verizon their LTE
coverage absolutely incredible but they
don't have HSPA or 4G or Foe G fallback
like AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile do so if you're
not on LTE you are on a really slow 3G
essentially it's EVDO Rev a which by
today's standard to be considered very
very slow and inadequate so again my
wife and I are in a problem we couldn't
quite make a phone call
we have to stay on a picks they're part
of the in the kitchen to make a call it
have a go through without dropping and
then again never sound at all that good
because we're gonna really somehow a
fringe area so I called the Verizon I
was like I got a probably cancel my
service what can you guys do and to
their credit and excellent customer
service they sent me a 3g cell tower out
the next day free of charge and that
worked very very well so if you have
issues with Verizon give them a call
that also brought a whole slew of
problems
Verizon also like T Mobile offers voice
over LTE but that cell tower was only 3g
because I was in a fringe LT area I had
to turn off the voice over LTE so when
they also had a turn off simultaneous
voice and data which was a bit of a pink
if I was doing that and it got one bar
of LT or try me to call over LTE and not
over 3G which is what that MIDI tower
they sent me was so I didn't get some of
the things that I would want with
Verizon I couldn't do voice and data
which is really annoying and beyond that
whenever I would drive away from my
house I would leave through my Wi-Fi
signal that that cell tower was using
for 3G I would drop the call and that
also got to be a bit of a pain the
outside of that Verizon
absolutely credible anywhere I went I
almost always had service sometimes it
would drop that dreaded 3G but I would
say with the few exception
my house being one of them I could make
a phone call everywhere I went
whether I was in a huge warehouse
shopping center whether I was in the
grocery store let me take a call on a
movie theater anywhere I went Verizon
had service again subject depending on
where you are but their ability to get
through walls was really second to none
so that four months passed I figured I
was going to go back to AT&amp;amp;T to see how
their service had improved and I will
say that dead zone inside my house I can
make calls with AT&amp;amp;T I generally get two
to three bars of LT note doesn't mean
much I went through actually checked
with the numbers our service is pretty
strong I haven't yet had a dropped call
in my home I don't need any sort of cell
tower or any sort of extender to make a
phone call which is very nice data
speeds are not fat typically outdoors as
what I've seen with Verizon or t-mobile
I don't have Wi-Fi calling I don't have
prevalence of HD voice or voice over LTE
which TTT keeps saying is coming and
it's sort of supported on some devices
in always small pockets but far from
widespread but I do a simultaneous voice
and data so at least for me right now it
looks like 18 TS sort of the best option
but I wanted to sort of share my story
and I've been purposely not sharing what
up that happening so I wanted to make a
big video detailing what's been going on
Suzy decides which carriers not bear
this in mind when I went back to AT&amp;amp;T I
signed up for a new planet their 10 gig
with rollover data they gave me a full
month's extra rollover data so now I've
got 19 gigs of data which is a lot of
data to use I'm gonna try ATT again now
for four months and then Sprint is going
to be next and I'll share my opinions on
Sprint anyway what's your guy's opinion
be you're considering switching carriers
hopefully you found this helpful I want
to do the hard work for you so the
memorial being a foreigner fringe area
definitely try it first and forsaking
about t-mobile
make sure you try the Wi-Fi calling
before you bikes it might not be able to
cracked up to be
and I think you guys for watching thank
you for sitting through the story I hope
it helps you guys avoid some the
pitfalls that I went through until next
time John rende your TechnoBuffalo hey
