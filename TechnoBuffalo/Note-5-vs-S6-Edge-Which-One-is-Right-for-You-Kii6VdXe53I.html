personal choice there are a ton of great
options out there especially in the
flagship range what I've got in front of
me is two let's just call them kissing
cousins for lack of a better word
I've got Samsung's latest galaxy s6
edge+ which I'm just going to call the
edge plus and the galaxy note5 I'm John
render from TechnoBuffalo I'm gonna show
you the differences between these two
and hopefully help you pick the one
that's right for you so first the specs
they are spec for spec save for some
curved glass and an S Pen identical
which means based on the same android
5.1 lollipop same XE no 7420 octa-core
processor same four gigs of ram
available in 32 or 64 gig that same
gorgeous 5.7 inch qHD display 2560 by
1440 make your mom proud too much the
PPI is on that if you said 518 either
have a good memory or you are much
smarter at math than I am same 16
megapixel camera on the back same five
on the front the exact same for better
or worse 3,000 million power battery
same wireless charging and fast charging
capabilities so what are the differences
between the phones let's start with what
you can see and first the color I can
say that this gold platinum edge plus is
the most beautiful color I have ever
seen on a phone it is stunning in person
I know gold phone sometimes look a
little bit feminine to people this one
looks not masculine or feminine
it just looks absolutely gorgeous it's a
beautiful looking color unfortunately
though I'm not available on the note
which we've got neither black sapphire
which is they should just call blue
because it's blue so we have here or
white pearl which actually is just white
you can also get this in same black
sapphire color but if you're getting the
edge plus yourself a favor and for sure
I get it in the gold so it's called the
edge plus for a few reasons
it really just one reason it curves the
screen has an edge on it I loved the way
the s6 edge felt in the hand this one
feels even better than that
it's not so sharp along the sides like
it was with the s6 edge you can hold it
without sort of feeling like you're
getting a lot of pressure put on your
finger it's a silly thing but you
definitely notice it so the advantages
of the edge are a few first Samsung
giving you some sort of edge tweaks you
can do so if you swipe in from the side
first thing you're going to see is the
ability to add
edge apps or edge contact depending on
which screen you've got
well it's our that it's pretty simple
you can just add shortcuts apps and you
launch them that's the sign of it other
over here you can get edge people and
this is they're not like your edgy
friends with like a nose ring these are
just people you can set up we can get
selective on colors for them you can
dial them quickly right from here or if
you turn your phone over when they call
you'll see a glow come out of the side
knowing who's calling you it's a small
touch one that I really have yet to find
a use for but it is kind of neat one of
the other cool things about the edge is
how it looks when you're playing video
or taking pictures the video that seems
to wrap around the side screen creating
a really immersive experience I'm taking
pictures it almost looks like you just
have two bezels on the top on the bottom
and you're just seeing through the phone
it's a really cool effect and one that I
really enjoy and the difference is of
course price the edge is going to be
more expensive but every carrier's got
their own pricing schemes if I don't
know what they're going to cost we'll
put a picture of that up right now
I like that cost as of launch but
certainly check with your carrier
because prices are always bound to
change so let's move over to this guy
the note so it is a little bit heavier
171 grams versus 153 on the edge plus
but I really like the extra weight I'm
just going to say it I'm not a big fan
of this black sapphire let's just call
it blue we saw it on the s6 it shows
fingerprints like crazy I don't have
like super greasy hands but like you
know they get a little sweaty sometimes
and you can definitely see every mark on
the phone but the color aside I like the
extra a little bit of weight on here so
whether you love or loathe Samsung's
design change they certainly went a
different direction with both these
devices keeping the design language of
the s6 and the s6 edge but something
unique here with the note is they curved
the sides and they curved the back of it
as opposed to the screen on the edge
that sounds like something really
trivial but it makes the phone feel
incredible in the hand I know that's
something that you hear quite a bit here
for me quite a bit but this phone really
does feel nice it's a really subtle
thing but one that I'm definitely aware
of whenever I hold the phone and I've
really enjoyed it small tweak boots I
really give Sam some credit for that the
other big deal with the note is the
s-pen I turn the screen off for a reason
so it looks located right down here in
the
right and corn in the screen is now sort
of spring loaded so you know what to put
your finger in there and pop it out if
just push it in and it ejects itself
I'll go ahead and pull the pen out and
show you you can do with it so it looks
like my screen is off but I can actually
draw on it if I want it to I'll do a
little smiley face guy and one thing
you're not gonna be able to hear I can
pick up through the mic is that there's
a little sort of faint noise as I drag
the pen over the screen similar noise
that you get if you took pencil on paper
small tweak one that's really nice also
it appears to be much closer to real
time there isn't much of a lag as I do a
little fine movements here with the pen
so a cool tweak here you can go ahead
and add notes and save it real quickly
without having to turn the screen on I
will say though if you want to get
access this feature you have to go into
the s-pen setting to turn it on it's not
there I turn on your device so just bear
that in mind so when you eject your pen
which now you can other people in
meetings by just clicking it doesn't do
anything it does make a clicky notice
that people are not going to like you
for so we get a little icon right there
you go ahead and sort of have your pen
over it's called Air Command then you
cap it you get a ton of options here
these bottom two are customized we can
set these for any app shortcuts you want
I use Chrome and each studio so you get
a few options your action memo is going
to let you sort of just draw things like
a memo I've done two imitation of these
before but slice its say if you want to
draw notes that's where you're going to
go smart select I'll let you select
things on your screen that you want to
take shots of you do the whole screen
and oval or serve like a lasso to select
this particular part of it
screen right I'll take a screenshot
you're right right on the screen and
that's notes kind of where all those
things are going to live and all they're
all going to be stored
all your memos and things will live in
there I will say the s-pen is neat it's
been refined it feels better in the hand
but it's something that I'm probably not
going to use very often I've never
really used the S pen's all that much
it's that feature to have it's nice to
know it's there if I'm going to use it's
probably going to be that feature when
the screen is off and just write a quick
phone number down so that for me is not
a determining factor for the kind of
person likes to draw a lot of things on
your phone or write notes there might be
a reason to buy the phone but for me I
don't really use it all that often when
both these phones got announced I
thought for sure listen I like the s6
edge the edge plus is definitely going
to be the phone for me and as we go
through the testing for the degrees
reviews I'm spending time with each and
I got to say is cool assisting
looks and it looks incredible in person
it's almost a conversation piece because
it really has nothing else like it
except for the s6 edge but I think if I
had to pick one of these up I would pick
up the note the extra weight feels
really nice the curve on the back again
is something subtle but it looks
gorgeous if I could just get this in
that color
now I would be a very happy guy but
unfortunately we don't always get what
we want other things we'll cover I get
two for review like battery life
performance and the rest of it we want
to give you guys a quick comparison of
these two phones you decide maybe which
one's going to be right for you thank
you guys for watching hope you enjoyed
until next time I'm John render from
TechnoBuffalo with the big subscribe bar
we always appreciate it of course thumbs
up always helps until next time see you
