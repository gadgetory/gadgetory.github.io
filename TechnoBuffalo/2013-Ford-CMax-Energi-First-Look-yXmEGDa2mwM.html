with John Davis he is the chief c-max
engineer for Ford and John you're gonna
run through the c-max Energi and what is
it specifically about the energy that is
different from the hybrid model sure
what the c-max Energi does is our first
production plug-in hybrid we basically
use a lithium ion battery that has
greater storage capacity therefore
greater energy so we begin to blend the
capabilities of a full electric vehicle
with a traditional hybrid and get that
best of both worlds so that we don't
have the range limitations that a true
electric has and then as soon as we get
to a depletion level on the battery now
we go into full hybrid mode of course
that's done seamlessly now what are we
talking about for a driving range so we
haven't released the final
specifications for that yet but what I
can't tell you is it will be greater
than the Toyota Prius plug-in hybrid
that they've recently launched and we
expect in terms of overall fuel
efficiency that our miles per gallon
equivalent or mpge that you've heard of
will be better than both the Chevy Volt
and the Toyota Prius plug-in can we talk
about the battery that is its
lithium-ion what type of lithium-ion
batteries now there are different
flavors of them yeah I would probably
turn you over to one of our cell experts
in that but basically it's a
multi-celled configuration we actually
assemble it in-house
both for the c-max hybrid and the c-max
Energi and the real difference between
them are the number of cells and the
amount of cell energy storage that we
can utilize the other thing that's
unique for the c-max Energi is it has
its own onboard charger it's actually
packaged within the overall battery
assembly so it's within that steel
casing that Derrick mentioned earlier
and of course all of that is housed
within additional high-strength steel
shielding or for safety purposes you
also have some other technologies
regenerative braking and there's also an
exhaust heat system works and how do
both of those work so in a normal car
you'd press on your brakes and two
things would happen your car would slow
down and you'd basically be creating
Heat in the case of the hybrids both the
c-max Energi and the c-max hybrid
we're utilizing the propulsion system
and the transmission to help slow down
that vehicle and it's actually providing
the mechanism to recover the energy and
basically work as an alternator or
generator to charge that battery up
while you're slowing the vehicle that's
what makes hybrids particularly so
effective in city cycles right do you do
a lot of braking a lot of stop and go
effort the other item you asked about
was the engine heat recovery we're doing
that from the standpoint of being able
to pair a heat off of the exhaust
manifold we utilize that as a part of a
fast warmup cycle it's more efficient
for us to heat up the emission system so
that we can get to the right emissions
control and part of our neighbor to do
that is to use the engine heat from the
exhaust to warm it up faster so we
haven't announced final pricing what we
said is obviously these vehicles in
their space will be very competitive in
terms of the c-max hybrid it'll be our
most affordable hybrid we'd ever believe
it reproduce so I've been talking with
John Davis chief engineer of the c-max
the rumored Prius killer but that's off
the record all right so this is my
chrome from TechnoBuffalo thanks for
tuning it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
