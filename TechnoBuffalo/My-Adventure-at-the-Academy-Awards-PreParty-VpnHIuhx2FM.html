Saturday februari 21st tomorrow
obviously being februari 22nd is the
Academy Awards one of my sponsors my
gear store calm is actually sponsoring
one of these celebrity gift bags that
they give all the celebrities and even
in this bad economy they're still giving
them all kinds of crazy stuff so they
have asked me to go to Los Angeles and
help consult with them as to what
technologies in or hot that they should
include in the gift bags so I'm going to
drive it up to LA to help them do that
right now and then I get to stay for one
of the official launch Capri parties
which should be a lot of fun so I got
them to agree to let me take my foot
minnow women I'm gonna see might get any
fun footage while are there say anything
that could be interesting Pettis so stay
tuned and I'll see you guys want to get
back bye bye
hey guys so I filmed that intro on my
way up to LA and as it turns out things
were very different than what I expected
so let me feel you around 10am 45 minute
drive from Orange County which where I'm
located there were security all around
it so I finally found a parking spot and
I walked inside the lobby and there were
signs everywhere that said Oscar pretty
party giveaway 8th floor so I went up to
the 8th floor again more security I gave
him my name and I was escorted to this
gorgeous gorgeous sweet on the top
florida beverly dalton it was actually
so tall that the balcony was directly I
level with a Beverly Hilton sign so that
was kind of cool and overlooks a really
iconic pool it was a probably
opportunity i'll never get again to be
in one of those sweets which I can only
imagine what's something like that cost
per night probably crazy so what I
thought I was gonna be doing for my gear
store was consulting them on what's our
products that should be giving away to
these celebrities and then attend the
party later turns out what I thought it
was wasn't even close to what actually
ended up being so when I walk into this
sweet essentially it looked like a mini
trade show I mean there were little
booths set up all over the suite in
different rooms each one of those boost
was an individual company and each
company had their own bags or a giveaway
if they were giving to the celebrities
so a celebrity would come in and be
escorted from booth to booth by a
publicist or a PR rep and before they
came to your booth someone would come to
you and say hey John we're bringing by
so-and-so just give you a heads-up so
myself and another guy from my gear
store where the two staffing my gear
store coms booth and they were giving
away iphone cases ipod cases some
speakers they had some backpacks on
display some macbook sleeves all kinds
of stuff they were giving away turns out
they already had the gifts already set
up it was actually the third day this
was going on so I was just there to talk
tap at the celebrities so they would
come by and say you know we're
interested in Apple products what do you
guys
have so guys for my gear store would
give him a rundown on what my gear store
did and they turn it to me and say you
know John I'll tell you more about
what's coming out and what's new and
what's hot technology and I would talk
about it turns out a lot of people are
very interested in the palm pre so
that's what it's gonna get device I'm
gonna have to check out and I really
would just talk to him we kind of shoot
the breeze for 5-10 minutes and then
move on to the next booth everybody that
I met was really nice a lot of people
that were there they're mostly TV show
actors we're from shows I don't really
see shows like 90210 the hills and a few
other shows on CBS that's I really don't
watch I didn't really recognize that
many people people that I did recognize
where a Julie Benz from Dexter which
actually one of my favorite shows she
plays dexter's girlfriend and he was
also in Rambo which is a great movie by
the way check it out there were some
actresses from CSI Miami one of my
favorite shows as well weeds and 30 rock
the actor who plays Jonathan and Sanjay
was there so I was kind of cool to see
him Mario Lopez easy Slater came by AC
Slater from Saved by the Bell suppose
you that are too young to remember that
it's a great show those of us that were
born in the 80s kind of grew up with it
so it was kind of neat to see him Adrian
Grenier from Entourage came through he's
Vinnie chase people are going crazy for
a woman from Battlestar Galactica I
didn't recognize her she was an older
lady but she did say that she got a
chance to see the premiere episode of
the spin-off forgetting about art
Galactica I don't want to show so I do
recommend sir just said the spin-off
looks awesome Posey their fans of the
show I guess keep looking out for the
spin-off so it was a nice opportunity to
get to see all these people I don't get
very starstruck so I wasn't as
impressive some other people were but it
was really cool to get to talk to people
and get a talk about technology the guys
are my gear store we're really nice
hooked me up with some free stuff so
that was always cool I actually using
some of the stuff they gave me I put a
speck case on my iPhone kind of meat you
guys would see that can zoom in a little
bit this is example of kind of stuff
they were they were getting away and see
it's a speck on it and this is on my
gear store it's kind of got that yellow
accents on the side
texted on the front chemical so guys
that's really it those are kind of my
exploits of the day on Saturday I'm
sending out a little excerpts via
Twitter now there were some such
gluttonous things there was a dog there
that had a nine carat diamond necklace
on this economy to have a dog with a
nine carat diamond necklace was crazy I
have never seen so much plastic surgery
before in my life everything was in
hands and stretched there was some six
year old women whose face is healing
look Lou you know someone's like there
Ted a crank behind their head to tighten
it up I mean just didn't look natural
not necessarily my scene but again it
was really cool to be there I thank the
guys in my gear store for inviting man I
hope that I can help them in other
future events so guy just want to fill
you in on kind of what happened and if
you were interested and I will see you
guys in the next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
