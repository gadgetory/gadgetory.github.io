to you by domain.com what's going on
everyone John Ranger from TechnoBuffalo
with a full review for you of the Strato
smart card it's one of the new wave of
credit cards that aims to replace all
the other cards in your wallet from
debit to credit to loyalty cards it
wants to be the one thing you carry to
simplify your life and of course your
big fat wallet that's give you back pain
let's take a look at the Stratos so here
is the box that it's going to come in
it's pretty simple I'm gonna have your
card on top I've got a member number
taped off and my signature other than
that it's pretty simplistic in the box
you've got the set-up guide for iOS or
Android you've got a scanner that you
plug this into 3.5 millimeter on your
phone and there's an app you download
you swipe your cards all in and that is
it it's a really simple it's allegedly a
very simple process to set up we'll talk
about that we get to the review a little
bit more about this card compute the
shadows kind of a different business
model than other smart cards so first
you can store all of your cards your
credit card debit card loyalty card like
I mentioned safety is obviously a big
concern something like this and it uses
Bank level encryption and also it's
never going to display your card numbers
doesn't have any e display on it or
anything so the vendor you hand it to is
never going to see your card number
shields are eliminating that potential
for fraud it's also Bluetooth executive
course so if you select the option in
the app it'll lock the card down a
certain amount of time or if it's ever
lost so here's how the card works it's
95 dollars per year to get the cards a
membership fee and what that's going to
give you is a new card every year
Lizabeth presumably new features so
they've said they're working on a
fingerprint scanner NFC chip and pin and
things like that to get a new card every
year Altea so you'll get those new
features that might not be here right
now that's gonna be available in five
colors just that little blue part is
going to change so you're saying this
thing works you're probably asking how
does it work doesn't have a screen or
any sort of physical buttons so it works
by a series of taps
these three grid of dots are actually
touch sensors when you go ahead and
swipe your cards and you can program
which one each is going to be and you
kind of have to remember you can double
tap your phone double tap the card in
your phone and it's supposed to pop up
here on your lap turn to show you what
but in case you forget that never worked
for me also setting this cart up was a
relative nightmare I had to work with
customer support sort of show Bluetooth
information and it took much longer than
I thought to set it up but I will say
the shadows credit their customer
service walking through it and did a
great job sort of getting this up and
working despite it not working out of
the box so let's get your card working
things are pretty simple if you give it
one tap either on your hand or on a
surface it's going to blink and tell you
which card you have active
so again happen again I'll show you a
cardiovascular select which card you
want to use so I've got this set up for
my personal Visa card my TechnoBuffalo
Amex and then my debit card down below
and it's pretty simple to do and it
works almost every time again that's
double tap fit the car do you want touch
a sensor and now that card is active
there's no way as soon as you touch it
that card is ready to go Oh an issue
that people have had with these smart
cards of them not working all the time
something like this and I really need to
work 100% of the time and I will say
Stratos has worked almost every single
time I've used it with the one exception
one time at an 8 atm but it did work at
that same ATM previously so might have
been user error
but I'm feeling relatively comfortable
carrying Stratos only something that I
did not feel with the coin I still want
to use it a little bit longer I've had
it as a credit card for about two and a
half weeks but I'm getting pretty
comfortable I could carry this as my
only credit cards obviously what shadows
is aiming for it's thin it's light its
bendable feels just like an ordinary
credit card with a batterer heat an LED
light built-in so pretty cool they're
also being able to say to tell you that
the battery is starting to run low they
will know and they'll send your new card
out the mail so never really have to
worry about battery life at all we
stopped real fast and thank our peeps at

one of the reasons that the car seems to
work more than any other smart card
those dual mags
it just seems to offer more options
whether it's at an old swiping station
or a new one it's pretty much always
worked I also tried this card inside of
a bank man have to swipe your card to
show your identification if you want to
withdraw cash or deposit money and that
works - so I'm batting like 0.9999 out
of this which is working which is the
best that I've seen from any of these
smart options guys want to know more
about the shadows let me know put a link
to it down below overall been really
happy with it this is sort of the first
smart car test that I could see myself
actually using continue to have my
wallet in fact I am keeping it in my
wallet it can store more than three
cards as well you can store an infinite
amount of cards on the app and just load
it on there whenever you need to
presumably if you have a rewards card
for example and you go into target with
our word card - might be open up the app
load it on to the Stratos and good to go
these are just the three that you use
the most now they have the touch sensors
on the front what do you guys think
could you use this could you not use
that if I don't hear your thoughts on it
do you like the UI is took a while to
get used to assume you had a higher
learning curve but once I got it working
it just kind of worked and work well I
guess that's the best you can say about
a card like this I wonder your thoughts
on leave in the comments down below if
you wanna see their you did on the coin
put the link to it right here until next
time I'm John render some TechnoBuffalo
see you guys next video so let
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
