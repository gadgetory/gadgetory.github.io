technobuffalo here back with another
episode of ask the Buffalo this is when
you get asked me any question you want
you can ask your question one of two
ways we'll put up a post on
TechnoBuffalo where you can leave your
question in the comments or you can send
them to twitter with the hashtag at the
be and i will answer them these
questions are not screen beforehand my
answers are coming right off the top of
my head so if you see me glance out over
to my rights because i am reading them
so let's go ahead and get started the
first question comes from dances maki
from the website do you think the iphone
4 is most likely going to have 4g I dan
I can tell you that I hope so so we're
looking at now two separate carriers at
least in the u.s. 18-team Verizon
running on two different main
frequencies so AT&amp;amp;T will have an LTE
network they currently don't they're
calling their hspa+ network 4g verizon
on the other hand has a 4G network using
LTE but they don't have an hspa+ network
so if they were to make the iphone 4 4g
it would have to support both of those
you could say you would have LTE and
then AT&amp;amp;T just wouldn't support it yet
until it got launched I think it's going
to get really messy so unfortunately my
sad sad answer is that I think the next
iPhone will not have 4g as you guys have
ever used Verizon's 4G network I've
talked about it ton it is blazing fast I
would love to have an iphone on
Verizon's 4G LTE network that would make
me quite the happy panda all right so
let's go to the next question this is
also from the website from Skycam 97 how
many staffs this technobuffalo have um
if I answer that i'm going to enter
something dirty so i'm just going to
skip them okay so let's go over to
twitter using the hashtag ask the be
this one comes from the CL Kroy at John
for laker
is I'm looking to buy a tablet how do I
know which one is right for me there are
some awesome tablets on the market at
least for the ones that I've gotten my
hands on there are two that really stand
out as fantastic and full-featured if
you sway towards Apple or you've had
your heart set on an ipad the ipad 2 is
a wonderful choice if you perhaps go the
google android route i can't recommend
the Asus Transformer enough I put those
two head-to-head in the transformer one
it is a wonderful android tablet it
works well it's fast it's got the Tegra
to chip in it it's a beautiful IPS
screen you will not be disappointed I'm
hard pressed right now to recommend the
playbook its lack of a native email
application without using some sort of
blackberry bridge is a huge huge huge
detriment once the PlayBook has those
key features like a calendar and an
email application the PlayBook would be
a great third choice no one had a chance
take a look at the tab 10.1 at Google
i/o and seems to be very very fond of it
we're going to hold off though and
recommending it until Noah gets to put
it through the full paces so those would
be my answer for that question the next
question comes from John Fleming on the
website blackberry or iphone PS do you
think that bbm will ever be on any
device other than blackberries well
before the iphone came out in 2007 I was
a pretty big blackberry enthusiast and
loyalist I had had the curves i was
using before the first iphone i had was
at the IRA forgot the model number on it
it was the great one at the big
scrolling wheel on the side I loved that
one I had the old-school blackberry that
wasn't even in color yeah i really liked
having blackberries and the operating
system however just hasn't advanced as
fast as Andrew as fast as webos and as
fast as iOS I need a modern browser that
works well and what rim has put out on
the torch and on the storm devices just
can't keep up in my mind well it does
now kind of render real web pages I
think if they've been a little bit left
in
dust so I would recommend you know that
question of grasping iphone or
blackberry the answer of the iphone the
broader answer would be android or
iphone would be too fantastic choices to
check out so hopefully that helps BBM
which is blackberry messaging service
will make it other devices the answer is
probably but I don't have any sort of
insider biznass home at all right so
let's go to another question this one's
from will Hicks this is from the website
what do you think about the future of
honeycomb and Android you think
everything android related announced at
Google i/o was good for the future of
the platform oh well honeycomb will be
as it superseded by ice cream skema CH
which is going to take over and beautify
the android platform or at least try to
so honeycomb is sort of a step in
between uh I think that we've seen
honeycomb 31 coming out to zoom tablets
will see it come out to the rest of the
herd honeycomb tablets and then it'll
all be about ice cream and the big
debates going to be what is my honeycomb
tablet going to get updated ice cream
it's not getting updated its not getting
updated they're going to want to make
you buy a new tablet that's the nature
of tech unfortunately so it's annoying
if you really want to get your hands on
some ice cream tablets your best bet is
probably going to wait until the
holidays of this year all right let's
take a few more questions let's go to
Josh this is also from the website hey
John do you think the 3ds will catch on
and sell as much as idiots also you
think the NGP which is Sony's
next-generation portable or PSP two will
outshine and make people forget about
the 3gs you guys have heard me talk
about the 3d as quite a bit I love that
it's in the marketplace I love that it
exists and people can play stereoscopic
3d which is 3d without glasses for me it
kills my honest after 15 minutes using I
felt like I've been staring at a
computer monitor for like eight to ten
hours no I was just feel tired and buggy
what they have fall out of your head off
the floor and then roll down the stairs
that's how I felt isn't it three
yes I think it's novel I think that
people are attracted to 3d technology
right now I do not think it's going to
outsell the DS line noloty s light
excels throughout the course of its life
span unfortunately I think people are
going to see the 3d is a bit of a
gimmick on it it could be way wrong on
that maybe I'm just not too tired
demographic part which is very true I am
more interested in Sony's NGP next
generation portable that thing is
actually graphics powerhouse I think
that the hardcore gamer is going to be
attracted to the NGP and the folks at
one play a fun Mario game it's going to
have a nice replay value are going to
want to go too deep to read es it's kind
of been in dos bread and butter all
right so let's take a question from
Twitter when do you think iOS 5 will be
released from super nigga man good
question I think we'll see it at WWDC
just the worldwide developers conference
not what would David Cameron WC David
Cameron do nope I think we'll see it at
June I don't think we're going to see it
out until the next iPhone the iPhone 5
which probably won't be coming out until
sep tember so developer preview for a
few months so September is when you'll
probably want to get it on your phone
and that's a phone there's one is from
tyler g and this is all on the website I
beach rested in seeing a video or
article comparing intel and AMD i know
it's good in terms of Intel but I'm lost
when it comes to a and D it's like the
metric system ring maybe you have
compared and contrasted was a side by
side like core i7 and AMD's that's a
great point to bring up Tyler thank you
we will look into it and get out there
there's a lot of competing chip
manufacturers AMD and Intel so we will
do our best to do that for you alright
so let me go ahead and answer a few more
questions oh this one's from de Micco
them Verity I don't know if you're
Italian but I'm saying with Italian
accent that's also from the website
would you buy a Chromebook chromebox or
any type of chrome os-based machine my
answer personally you say
will you I know I wouldn't buy it I I
know it's tough I hate to see it I guess
more in person I played with the chrome
OS a little bit I want to see how it
works on final SPECT hardware the idea
of having everything be online is a
little bit odd for me if you lose
internet connection it's hard to sort of
access stuff you have local file storage
but not much and that's really the big
drawback I think it's great for
consuming media much like a tablet but
I'm dubious when it comes to media
creation i know it's obviously it's got
support for all the Google Docs and all
that business but I'm skeptical I could
be wrong about once I get my hands on it
and I always say one more let's try one
more and this is the itunes pick from
twitter where you get information for
your vlogs and such not specific sources
but generally a lot of the information
that i get comes from just being a super
nerd I read about every sort of
electronic out there i did before i
started doing videos i still do it it's
my love and passion but for example when
a new phone comes out so we just unbox
the Xperia Arc I generally know the
specs of it you know I remembered that
it had a four point two inch screen I
remember the resolution was a bit higher
than qvga I don't remember exactly what
it was I knew that had the gigahertz
processor in an 8 megapixel camera and a
smile recognition which I remember from
CES better the full spec business that I
go and I read when I do like my box and
reviews I generally i get from the
manufacturers website and i'll read it
just to make sure that i remember them
all and i'll put some notes down x me
actually here are the notes that i did
for the Xperia Arc when I filmed it not
much you can see it's just sort of a
little recap on what I said generally I
don't need to refer to them what I'm
doing it almost all of my videos are
filmed without any sort of notes when it
comes to like card specs that I can
super easily mess up that all right down
but 99% of the stuff i say in my videos
are just sort of vomiting out of my
mouth so hopefully that helps at your
questions will be doing ass for the
Buffalo much much much more regularly i
love to sit and talk to you guys it's
fun and i don't know i like to answer
questions i hope you guys like them to
