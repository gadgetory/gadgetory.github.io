right we are here doing technical
buffalo things at what where are we we
are at CES and if you look behind me you
can see that we are in the Huawei area
of the press conference and I wanted to
show you guys where they really quickly
it's just this one little thing boom
Nexus 6p s I realized they look like
Nexus 6p s but you see a difference
right your eyes don't deceive you
this one is gold it's not all that gold
it's pretty pretty pale gold I'd call it
like more like a champagne but it's
still definitely a nexus 6p let's see
how it compares to the one that I've
been using as my daily driver in my
pocket yeah I mean it's the Nexus 6p so
compares pretty favorably we've got some
fun stuff going on behind us we've got
the Huawei m2 also announced today and
I'm really happy that we got some
hands-on time with all the new products
so why don't we go see take a look what
wall we've got store for us this year in
2016
CES alright guys check it out this is
the Huawei watch elegant this screen is
really really really pretty it's
difficult to tell on camera but it looks
so natural
these are exquisitely crafted these are
rose gold so that looks a little shiny
to you that's why lots of new watch
faces lots of new stuff basically you
can you can stop calling them Huawei now
you can just go ahead and call them
watch way
so the mate 8 has a four thousand
milliamp hour battery a 6-inch display
super high saturation looks really
really nice just to the eye 16 megapixel
camera and at crazy wah wake here in 950
superior octa-core processor this is
their very own silicon that's a big deal
for huawei the last time we saw
something like that was on the the
Samsung devices that came out this past
year they moved over to their own Exynos
line this has also got a fingerprint
scanner on the back looks like the same
as the six keys and we know that they do
quite well with their fingerprint
scanners so I'm pretty excited to get
this thing in at the office see if we
can get this thing of good run through
it feels really nice in the hand it's
really thin did not expect it to be
quite this thin it feels really really
light - feels like a strong piece of
hardware without skimping too much on
the the the internals it's surprisingly
been damn we've got a sort of a
champagne over here and then over here
we've got the same exact champagne so I
feel silly these look a lot and feel a
lot like the 6p it's almost like the 60s
brother would love to see something like
this running stock Android of course
last but not least this is the media pad
m2 TenPoint oh this thing comes with
this beautiful little stylus here it
feels really nice
dang wow that's the first time holding
it it's it doesn't click up at the top
but it feels really comfortable it feels
like the right size and writing on the
screen feels pretty darn good - I
wouldn't say it's like surface book good
but it certainly feels better than the
iPad pencil does and of course the m2 is
also running that brand-new silicon from
Huawei the Kirin series
octa-core processor it's a 10 inch
display look like a beautiful screen
it's running Android obviously it's not
quite stock but maybe we can get there
at some point the form factor is really
comfortable it's the same kind of metal
metallic build that you'll see on the 6p
and the new
mate eight this thing feels fantastic in
the hand this feels like a really great
cross between sort of like a Samsung
Android tablet and what you might be
more used to from the Nexus line tell
you what if the next Nexus tablet is
based on this little sucker right here
where I think we're all going to be
pretty happy there's a lot more to come
this year there's a lot more companies
that we're gonna take a look at some
stuff from plus so really really fun
stuff on the show floor that really
crazy moonshot brain thinking cool
bleeding edge stuff I can't wait to get
to those things so thank you guys so
much for watching be kind to one another
I'll catch you the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
