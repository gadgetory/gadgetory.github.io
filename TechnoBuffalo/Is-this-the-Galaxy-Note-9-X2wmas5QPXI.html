months but it seems like we are seeing
it everywhere the p20 pro from huawei
the Asus zenfone 5 and even some alleged
spy shots of the unreleased LG G 7 neo
looks to have the iconic notch up at the
top of the display and now looks like
one of Apple's biggest rivals who is
very publicly made fun of the company
for their unique design choice several
times may finally follow suit with other
manufacturers and embrace the knotch
earlier today a patent leaked from
China's state intellectual property
office that appears to show a filing for
a future Samsung phone with a notch up
at the top of the display the images are
a bit crude but with the help of concept
extraordinaire Ben Gaskin we're able to
get an exclusive look of what this
mysterious new Samsung phone may
actually look like according to the
filings this phone would have an almost
bezel is edge to edge display with a
notch up at the top and on the back a
horizontally stacked dual lens camera
system the phone looks flat-out gorgeous
and sitting side-by-side with the
current flagship the Samsung s9 you can
see that little extra screen real estate
really does make a big difference along
with this phone there is another
supposed Samsung phone that was released
with these filings it doesn't have a
notch on the display at all it's got a
single camera on the back of the phone
and on the front it has nothing to
obstruct the screen it's just one large
bezel is display now this phone looks
like a crazy concept but if it features
the in screen fingerprint technology
similar to what we saw back at CES on
the vive phone it could be the dream
smartphone many of us have long been
waiting for now to be totally clear
large companies like Apple and Samsung
are filing patents all the time many of
which are for products that will never
get made or some are for products that
are way down that production pipeline
but on the other hand this could very
well be the next Samsung flagship phone
possibly the note 9 and these vendors
that we're looking at now could soon
become reality maybe Samsung sees that
consumers aren't so off-put by the idea
of the knotch
as many originally thought if you want
to learn more and see these renders in
their full high-quality glory check out
the article link down below on
TechnoBuffalo calm and I'm super curious
what are you guys as thoughts on this
new alleged Sam's
phone having a notch is the notch design
trend something we're gonna see adopted
by all the major players or is it a fad
that's gonna fizzle out you like the way
it looks leave a comment down below let
me know I'm really curious to see what
you guys have to say also speaking of
notches and cameras specifically we've
got a really cool video coming up
showing off the new nest hello doorbell
this thing is packed with tons of
features and cool machine learning
abilities it's really cool be sure to
subscribe to the channel so you do not
miss that video coming to a subscription
box near you very soon I'm Robert
Rosenfeld a check no Buffalo thanks so
