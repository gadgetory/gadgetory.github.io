is technology that is one of the best
performing groups over the years it is
up nearly twenty percent since the last
time we hit down 13 k and just think
back then in May 2008 first generation
iphone still just a baby only your
coolest friends had one and tablets
didn't even exist but today it's a
full-blown tablet war and research in
motion is trying scraping clawing to try
to make its mark rim updating its tablet
operating system today and releasing the
long-awaited playbook to point oh and
get this it actually runs email but is
that a little too little too late let's
find out bring in jon rettinger
president of TechnoBuffalo john what do
you think too little too late for ram or
a fair entrant into the tablet
competition you know it arguably might
have been too little too late back in
april when the playbook initially
launched blackberry and rim particular
company that's known for email launched
a product without email the damage has
been done in the consumers minors it's a
shame because the operating system is
incredibly solid why do you say it's
incredibly solid consumers don't seem to
think so so it's a credible operating
system it runs on a qnx kernel based on
linux it's great for multitasking it can
run applications completely in the
background where rim has lacked has been
in developer support so you're looking
at the tablet world you want to get an
iPad you want to get an android device
tons of application support you're
looking at very very very minimal
choices on the PlayBook that's one of
the big reasons that it hasn't had that
mass consumer adoption that and lack of
email you know I'm looking on
bestbuy.com earlier today just to check
out prices i see a 16 gig playbook
available for the cool price of 199 it
initially listed for 499 yeah it has
been an absolute fire sale and rim if
you go if you check out their main
website is touting now that the playbook
not only has email but also has calendar
and contacts and those are features that
obviously should have been there from
day one for company that's known for
having those features they really it's a
king to launch in your car without a
steering wheel and that note chug we're
gonna leave it there are without a
steering wheel thank you very much jon
