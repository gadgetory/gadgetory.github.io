TechnoBuffalo comm checking out a quick
vs. between the Samsung Galaxy Note 3
and the iPhone 5 obviously first thing
you're gonna notice screen size Note 3
has a 5.7 inch screen while the iPhone 5
has a peasley almost 4 inch screen even
Beatson on ppi 386 versus 326 so you're
getting an extra 60 pixels per inch here
you can see it just warps it if we hold
them side-by-side it looks like they're
almost the same depth but the iPhone
actually beats the note 3 on this level
at seven point six millimeters versus
8.3 millimeters on the note 3 if we flip
the phone over we're gonna look at a
couple of the shooters so on the backs
of these phones you have a 13 megapixel
shooter on the note 3 it's gonna shoot
4k video if you have the right amount of
storage on your device if you are using
an iPhone 5 you're only getting 1080p
which still isn't anything to scoff at
but some other quick specs to look at
over double the battery size you've got
a 3200 milliamp hour battery on the note
3 vs. a 1500 on the iPhone 5 processor
wise a6 processor on the iPhone 5 and a
2.3 gigahertz quad-core for LTE on the
note 3 and a 1.9 gigahertz octa-core for
3g so definitely a powerhouse device
it's definitely a tale of two different
devices sorry this video is so short it
