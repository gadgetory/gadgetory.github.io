TechnoBuffalo show on live your to host
for today Sean ani editor-in-chief of
the site and i'm joined by deputy
managing editor Todd Hazleton hey
everybody are you doing today Todd I'm
good you're having a busy week yeah i
was saying i wrote as usual on
wednesdays the newsletter goes out this
morning so i was writing the newsletter
and i was like i wish i could write this
in you know newsletter at this i wish i
could write this in like revealing ink
so that later the stories that we're
working on now there's a lot of meetings
we're taking a lot of reviews were
working on but we can discuss yesterday
we can't discuss the meeting you had
this morning that's right but we can
discuss yesterday which was the droid
event a memory you've got a meeting we
can't discuss yeah there's lots of
things going on this week folks yeah but
the droid event how did the phones feel
really nice i like that so i didn't the
last time i played with the droids was
the motorola event where they in veiled
the pure and the play so it's been a
while and end the new Moto G so it's
been a while since I've seen Motorola
phones or play with them that said I
really like these devices I thought what
it's almost like verizon's sort of
bolstered them well i would say at least
the turbo so it's got this aluminum
frame the big thing with the turbos it's
like an unbreakable screen or very
shatter resistant let's say because you
could probably still break it if you try
hard enough and somebody certainly will
so but it's kelly aluminum Todd no one
would do that yeah nobody'll do it
they're letting anyone on YouTube trying
Joe Girardi on YouTube broken probably
but what they did is what was funny
during the press conference the
president I believe in motorola just
sort of took the phone like this high
you know standing so like shoulder
height maybe I dropped it face down on
the stage which is kind of daring but it
has like I guess like an aluminum border
around it and then extra layers on the
front and back that help keep it really
protected and when I was using it I
didn't notice that so that's pretty
sweet that you don't feel like you have
like you know some kind of bulky phone
back in the day you know some
the more rugged devices yours like what
the heck is this thing like you can
hardly get know you feel like you're
touching something above the display but
this didn't feel like that which is nice
and they have the Snapdragon 810
processor in it so you know depending on
how you look at it and upgrade over the
808 some people might argue with that
especially if you if they have the clock
speed clock down because of overheating
problems and stuff like that but I don't
know let me get that far deep in the
same 21 megapixel camera i believe as
before you can customize it through moto
maker and then you had the new max which
I forget off the top of my head again
sorry there's a lot of specs going
through these days but leave this is
like snapdragon 617 i think if it's not
that that's because i'm working on the
a9 review so I'm sorry and this has the
617 but anyway it's a 6 series processor
1080p display so that's actually down
from the quad HD display on the Moto X
play both have expandable storage which
I really like but they didn't have
fingerprint readers which is fine
because I didn't really expect that but
no marshmallow which is kind of not
great and I don't know when it's coming
but I feel a bit let's go marshmallow
like let's not let's not do lollipop
anymore yeah that seemed really odd that
those are not coming with marshmallow
yeah and the turbo has this huge verizon
logo right we're sort of you would see
the HTC logo on us and it's the old logo
so it's like this long check mark as
opposed to the new check mark they have
it's a very brief but you know verizon
they loved it like throw their logo on
everything well and we have a question
from such a Mahal about that were those
the motorola droids you were looking for
I knew that joke was coming at some
point today and what do you guys think
about carrier branding on smartphones I
hate it yeah I hate it too I don't mind
so much all the time like a lot of
people are making a big deal again about
the HTC on the a9 like above the home I
don't mind that so much but yeah when
you felt like carrier branding all over
it's like what the heck excuse me so um
I don't like that they were the droids
you're looking for they were pretty much
what we expected i think i would have
liked them better at they
you know features like marshmallow and
lollipop especially era I'm sorry
marshmallow and fingerprint readers
especially when you look at phones like
the v10 from LG what was that just heard
some feedback that already has the v10
on it so that was a phone you know it my
recording started looping on itself any
case the meantime to mean if you're
going for phones especially rugged I
like LG's v10 because it has sort of the
nicer designed above the g4i kind I
think it looks a little better than the
new the turbo 2 which is the rugged one
from them and it has a fingerprint
reader so when it does get marshmallow
you're sort of offset for this that's my
big cool not the I actually I got to use
the droid turbo for a little bit because
I want to see how Verizon worked where I
live and so I haven't touched the turbo
2 I really liked the turbo in it felt
great in the hand it was just a gorgeous
phone so I'm interested to see how the
turbo to turned out would you say it's
comparable to the turbo as always folks
this is not our review yeah i think so i
think in that sense i mean you sort of
get and and and i'm going back to the
max here too but you get really good
battery life with both I think turbo in
the sense that it might be a little
higher performing or better performing
than the 808 the Moto X pure you still
get the quad HD but these days I feel
like when the when the turbo came out
last year correct me if I'm wrong and
it's been a year but I'm pretty I felt
like that was sort of like this flagship
that was ahead of a lot of things and
this year I'm not sure I feel the same
way I would agree with you as I remember
when the turbo guy was like oh wow like
wow this is sweet phone and this year
I'm like well just sweet phone but there
are lots of sweet phones right yeah I
think that's part of the problem I mean
there are so many great phones on the
market right now that it's kind of hard
to for anyone to just stand out above
the crowd and go yeah
a where the the top phone I mean when it
comes to mixtures March March mobile
madness that we do yeah i mean that's
going to be insane trying to figure out
even what phones to put in the Hat
mm-hmm you know for us to put them into
the brackets I mean it there have been
so many great phones lately yeah and I
think that's why motorola spends a lot
of time mr. you talking about the
durable display because they're like
okay how do we stand out you know how do
we stand out against even our own phones
that are already selling like the Moto X
pure so I I did find one thing I think
one marketing this stuff yesterday so
they show this video of phones falling
and cracking hmm and then they showed
the droid turbo to not doing that they
were dropping phones they sell were they
I don't think I noticed that because I
was sort of back in the room i noticed i
think what appeared to be a sony and a
knife on right and verizon souls those
phones oh i see you're saying verizon
yeah yeah for sure so verizon would say
oh these folks will break by the way we
sell these yeah and i mean if you look
at and I'm sir just playing devil's I
think it but HTC has their uh protection
for the m9 and for the a9 stuff so that
even if you do drop your phone it does
break they'll replace it Motorola's task
you're there you know initiative here is
it oh it won't break anyway so you don't
have to worry about / placements and
stuff i don't know i don't know i'll be
really interested to see how they do the
one thing that bothered me actually this
sort of goes along with the carrier
branding they have so much blower and
it's incredible in allowing a lot of the
phones that i've been playing with
recently because we get the review units
and and me specifically here on the east
coast would be our international units
so they're usually free of carrier
bloatware and you know like a nine and
the galaxy s6 and stuff like that so I I
haven't seen this in a long time but
they were just loaded with like games
and verizon has like six of its own apps
pre-installed on there
whoa so that I would like to see that
stuff I don't everybody wants to see I
stop everyone wants to see that stop I I
don't understand why the carriers think
this is still ok I I guess they're
making money you know like by promoting
these games or something like I mean I
can see I like the last t mobile phone i
picked up i think i had like to tmobile
specific apps that okay I can live with
that right-eo but pre installing games
that's over the top Aman ya yeah just
like what the heck well I like recently
my my parents got a dell desktop and I
haven't played with a windows machine in
a couple years a brand new one and I
loaded it up and I was like oh they're
still coming with antivirus stuff yeah
it's like using Windows Defender it's
got all they are all kinds of stuff now
I am it's ridiculous absolutely
ridiculous well the second topic we
wanted to move on to today was a little
bit Apple earns but more just talking
about what's going on with them um I you
didn't get to listen in on the the
earnings call did you I didn't but I was
following along and what was said on
Twitter so I heard a bit of it really
interesting they have adjusted in their
numbers now that they do not expect
consumers to be on a two year upgrade
cycle with tablets but a three year
cycle huh and that it was said very
briefly very quickly I was like there it
is I knew there had to be a reason there
was in an error three this year
interesting and you know they I think
part of it they have to blame sinking
ipad so they're continuing to sink this
quarter for everybody didn't see their
history on something but you know again
ipad pro obviously the sales would not
be complete it's not even available yet
but you know that's sort of the thought
is that going to sell well is that going
to help change their sinking sales but
Mac sales were up which was interesting
or at least beat expectations is
interesting
yeah and iphone sales it was a record
fourth quarter on top of record third
quarter it back in July so everything
else look pretty good yeah everything
else looked good the ipad sales were
down you know there's a lot of good
stuff going on there but I there's one
there's one thing they always bring up
that annoys me because they bring out
you know thirty percent of the new
iphone buyers last quarter we're Android
switchers yeah that's great how many
people did you lose to Android right did
you have a net churn or did you have a
negative churn right but I mean you have
to wonder if its record sales then and
it's hard to figure this out but then
okay so there's an increased number of
iphone buyers if they're losing them
then that means that maybe there are
people who are coming from nothing
previously which makes sense given the
increased focus on emerging markets like
China South American so right and also
people that have been reluctant moving
over to a smartphone you know so yeah I
mean there has to be new people moving
in i think it was also interesting that
china sales were up ninety-nine percent
oh there you go i don't think i saw that
yeah yeah yeah they nearly doubled and I
fear over yacht but I could be wrong
something along the lines on Twitter of
like seventy percent of iphone owners
still have something older than like the
5s or older about this interesting now
that's not seventy percent obviously
people just bought iPhones but people
would still own the iphone right right
yeah well i mean if it works it works
you know Roy and I Rory Troy our
managing editor and I were discussing
that just yesterday you know we still
have ipad tues not air tubes but tues in
the office that we use every day for
like our teleprompter mmm you know it
still works it's fine that's interesting
I don't want to accuse it so you know if
the product works the product works yeah
yeah so why not just keep using I mean
yes folks like us you know we want to
always have
have you know we will I have iOS 9 and
the people that are back on you know the
for the 4s you know whatever they're not
getting iOS 9 they probably don't care
yeah they're on that phone for a reason
oh yeah exactly the phone so one other
topic I wanted to touch on briefly and
such Impala actually s just a question
about this what do you guys think of the
recently announced Samsung Galaxy hbu
tablet for those of you that don't know
the galaxy hbu tablet was finally
officially announced by same song this
morning yeah I we haven't gotten to
spend any time with it yet you know so
we're just working off of what we've
seen I just don't get it yeah I don't
get it either like the handle I don't
know I guess the hair like I feel like
it seems big and when I think tablet I
think you know like the way we use it
like oh maybe I get up in the morning I
check the news on it and then I carried
my backpack throughout the day in case I
need it like when I'm out and stuff like
that instead of a laptop but this is big
like I don't even know if it would fit
in a backpack I'm looking over here like
oh I don't know it what 18.4 inches or
something well I use my iPad a lot in
bed you know reading a comic or whatever
at night you know I imagine me laying
there with an 18.4 inch kitchen ahead
sorry not buckling my six plus hits me
when I drop it yeah exactly yeah so what
was the cause of death well apparently
he was using his tablet embedded and
fell on his head oh man Darwin horn but
I mean I think if we look at it it could
be and I was just looking at the press
images and stuff maybe for like kids in
a dorm and they don't have a TV or not
room for a TV but you have to think like
we don't know what this costs she has
since I didn't say but TVs I have one
right here that was like 250 bucks I'm
guessing this tableau it's gonna cost
more given that most tablets cost more
in this unit oh I've got I've got a
small TV in my kitchen that I need to
replace I went online to see how much
you know it like a 24-inch television
would cost or whatever now yeah
like a hundred fifty bucks yeah and then
you just get a Roku so like I feel like
even college kids might be like why do I
knew this thing yeah I don't know I I'm
all for trying new product categories
but I'm not quite sure who it samsung
with you know what if we had an 18.4
inch tablet well the funny thing is it's
like oh man it's they're starting to
fill in that gap between all the display
sizes because they used I mean they
literally have like everything from the
tiniest up to like n point one 12.2 they
had that tablet now we're at 18.4 and
then tvs and monitors looks like i have
everything i think it was what was it
two years ago you you got in late or
know that samsung announced their their
son de CES meeting after we'd re booked
your flight mm-hmm and you aren't
arriving until after the event so I i
went to the briefing and then i was
going to do the video right and they had
so many different i think they had three
different sizes three and I'm there with
our video guys trying to film this and
we had to keep reshooting because I kept
go saying the wrong size for this one
I'm like me good grief yeah it difficult
we got away from yeah well we have it
now oh so it appears that there's a
built-in handle though which is
interesting because that like you're
saying new product category i think that
could be a distinguishing factor here
because it's not it seems to work like a
tablet but it's not because a tablet I
don't do I have a tablet on my desk here
here's an ipad man like a tablet you
know is meant to be like this like
there's no you know carrying it this is
like a display with conch okay somebody
needs to come out with a boombox app for
it easy to walk around with it on your
shoulder seriously I'd be pretty funny
because that's the thing I mean maybe
it's just that like we gotta play with
it see what the heck it's about
I don't know I'm going to be really
curious to see exactly what the heck
this thing is and who it's meant for and
I don't know well let's go ahead and
jump on in two questions and this one
I'm going to jump to this one because
this actually relates to a topic I was
going to bring up any way from such
Impala well AV guys beginning the new
Apple TV for generation 2015 yes I
ordered one the other day I wasn't
expecting order one quite that soon but
at home where I have another Apple TV
guess what I've lost and I can't find
anywhere budget ever I'm sure you threw
it away for those of you on the
listening to the audio show I'm holding
up the infamous Apple TV remote Shawn
hates more than anything in the world a
stupid remote I think you threw it out
and then said oh gee where did it go I
gotta order anyone ah yes yes that
that's right because I've suddenly
turned into Todd wide excuse to order
any gadget ever enough true I was
finding myself we're gonna go on a
tangent real quick but I was finding
myself yesterday because I really do
like the a9 in a lot of regards this
doesn't have LTE though so I was like
okay maybe I'll buy my own but then I'm
like oh but it's kind of sluggish for
you'll see in my review but here's a
quick spoiler it's kind of sluggish for
loading games and substance very slow at
that but everything else is quick and I
added that 128 gigabyte microSD card
I've been telling you that been dying to
buy and if formats as an internal
storage so i have like 160 gigs or
something of storage on this little
thing and the fingerprint reader is good
it's got marshmallow so i was like gosh
by that then I'm like oh but the Moto X
pure might be the better by it's got a
quad HD display but by the time you you
know by the time I customize it to what
I really want and add the storage
because 16 gigs even with the expandable
doesn't have marshmallow yet so it's not
format as internal storage I was I going
on 832 so then it's 450 bucks and then I
like we'll wait that but now it's just
kind of like it's going to remind me too
much in the neck
six and all ready Onan x6 so why would I
buy another one of those then I'm back
on the a9 that's these are the kind of
thoughts I'd go through sorry that
tangent well here's what I voids like
should I buy try not well here's my
question though why do you need another
phone right now yeah that's a good
question well oh you know what like i
was saying a lot of my android devices
are our international so they're not LTE
but okay I don't leave my house that
often so I can just use the watch god
none of us leave our house yeah i'm
currently carrying around my nexus 6
which has my three UK sim card in it
uh-huh because it's got a gorgeous
screen i love the screen on it i'm just
using it as a Wi-Fi device right now
yeah aleko that's how i usually am i
guess most my devices yeah i mean it
won't work you know on any cellular
network until i get over to england next
right ah but back to that Apple TV I am
oh and this is the other way shut up
ahead of body devices I don't like
waiting for things so I want to be able
to go and like buy this and then plug it
in I don't want to wait like till no I
think it's November fourth is now the
earliest you can get the Apple TV if you
order now so I'll probably want when
it's in stores and I can drive up up the
block and have that in-store experience
in binary it's supposed to be in the
Apple stores on Friday yeah so I might
do that but the apple store in Manhattan
and best buy will have it on before not
to go ahead and see we'll see yeah mine
is currently preparing for shipment it
looks cool though the only thing that my
wife and I've been watching a lot of
content from amazon instant video which
is on Apple TV which kind of a bummer if
only it had that I'd be a little happier
wonder why it's not on there oh no
probably I know cuz it's on everything
else like Roku yeah either you can't
argue that it's because they want to you
know keep you on the fire TV because
it's on the roku yeah it could be Apple
but I don't know why Apple wouldn't
something but then there's an ample it
was
on the on there's an amazon instant
video app on ipad ipad yeah you're right
because you can download content there I
don't know why maybe hey maybe you'll
come out now well now that Amazon is
declared they're not no longer going to
allow the sale of Apple TVs yeah maybe
not then who knows a question from Davis
tap what do you think of the sales of
the surface book iPad pro and Samsung
view will tell us about the feature of
the tablet convertible market it seems
like companies are just trying to force
the market on the public when there
might not be at a man Davis you're a man
after my own heart I agree except for I
think the surface book is sort of like
the laptop thing ipad pro I sort of see
it's just not a laptop thing I don't
know big tablet like it's almost like
where the surface books trying to be a
laptop this is still hanging on to being
a tablet it seems like to me and I
haven't spent time with either one of
them I saw the surface book and touch
tip of those it then the Samsung view
what I gathered today is it's like not a
work machine at all like Samsung doesn't
seem to suggest that I mean you could
because Android but doesn't seem to be
suggesting hook up a mouse and keyboard
and get to work it seems like that's
just a totally different product
category but I think Davis is your honor
something in the sense that every
company now is like crap people aren't
buying tablets like they were when they
were hot maybe it said they're not
upgrading news every three years and
they're like now what do we sell them
for that and that's why we're having
like these oh but it's not just a tablet
it's also a TV or it's also a laptop or
it's also a huge iPad well I agree with
this is something I have said many many
times over the years as we've worked
here at TechnoBuffalo and even when i
worked at other tech sites you know
there are times where i go did anyone
ask the consumers if they want this
market to exist oh it's it's insane from
all the meetings that sit in there is a
study for everything and that's the
argument they use and rarely do you see
this study but they're like we talked to
consumers and this is
they want I mean I've sat in meetings
where phone company a one year is like
consumers don't want micro SD card slots
they don't care anymore we were lying on
the cloud next time they come back and
say oh consumers wanted micro SD card
slots that's why it's in this phone it
goes back and forth and for every topic
you can think of there's a consumer
reason why they've done this and often
it makes no sense i mean they could say
consumers want phones with handles on
them and everybody's like what are they
selling remember when they thought we
all wanted 3d phones yeah exactly like
Oh Joe in our internal research we've
found this and it never makes sense so
no that's what I think I think they're
trying to force exactly what he was
saying like this market that doesn't
exist but they will argue exists and
that's what people want because that's
what's that saying Steve Jobs like you
didn't know you wanted it until yeah
there something like that yes legend
what your that but it was something
along the lines of you know you yeah I
know I there there are many many times
where I'm like who thought this was a
good idea yeah and I think I think
they're after these things were like you
know they want that next big hit like
touch screens on phones were Apple
crushed it or big screens where Samsung
crusted with the first node phablets you
know now I remember covering phones when
4.7 inches was a was a huge display and
now here we are with the a 95 inches and
I'm like oh that's that's a relatively
small and palm friendly display so it's
crazy how industry to shift and I think
they're all trying to catch on something
big here one way out of this ayano very
very interesting uh from jeff k what do
you guys think of hcc jumping the price
of the a nine to five hundred dollars oh
it's a bummer i think this is the
bazaars pricing thing i have ever seen
yeah i have background information on it
that i can't specifically discuss but
399 was the hot spot and I think it
should have stayed there
yeah and i think that the a9 is a is a
great option at that price i'm not so
sure at five hundred bucks I don't know
which is hard because it's uh it's
difficult to address in reviews I'll say
this for a lot of people who otherwise
didn't see that price change coming yeah
it's surprising in a lot of ways even
though they said it was temporary I
don't think anybody knew is going to be
so temporary I mean you really have to
buy the phone before what november
seventh yeah i think so i just don't
think that was a good idea yeah uh from
such a mahal what do you guys think of
the use of YouTube read it will it be a
success or a flop I don't know no I'm
not one who would pay for that yet
because I haven't really used like
YouTube music or whatever the what is it
I think it's just called you to music I
remember youtube players i know they
that comes with google play music we can
watch the music videos and download it
is offline and all that stuff so i
haven't been using it anyway even though
it's sort of been around and now you
know to pay a subscription fees to what
so inherently and forever has been free
is mind-boggling to me i mean yeah you
get rid of the ads which is really
convenient but I just I can't even wrap
my head around if that makes any sense
that's like it's like if Google came to
me tomorrow and said like chrome is 299
a month now I'd be like but I can you
see it free forever like what my only
fear is that they're going to start
increasing the number of ads we see ya
so you're like oh wow I really need to
yeah not sitting through a minute every
time I want to watch a video yeah I know
that I'm really concerned about that mmm
but we'll see I I personally have no
interest at this moment in subscribing
to read yeah you know what I'd be
interested in seeing to is a report on
when our consumers fed up with too many
of these monthly bills like I think
all throughout time probably we've all
had monthly bills I mean you have the
telephone bilieva gas or electric la la
la but now it's like for every little
aspect of your consumer life is like
another payment so it's like music and
movies it but movies over here on
netflix or a little bit more each month
and then over here you get amazon prime
because you got to pay a monthly
delivery and blah blah re annual it's
like wow that's a lot of payments and
when what's important and and when is
that going to start affecting what
people decide to pay for i recently
consolidated how i did all that stuff I
got a new credit card and I'm using it
for nothing but my monthly subscriptions
right now that's interesting and yeah
it's super interesting because and the
thing is then you get into a bargaining
situation with yourself where you're
like yeah but it's only nine ninety-nine
a month yeah that's just one night at
the movies you know cuz like I recently
subscribed a Marvel unlimited the you
know you can read as many marvel comics
as you want yeah it's 999 a month I'm
like but at the same time if I go into a
comic book store and buy four books the
0 or three books you know it's gonna be
that much so but then there's my netflix
in my hulu and and you're like wow this
is adding up and and i noticed because
just for like review purposes stuff
we've talked about like one of the new
windows phone comes out I'll do the Xbox
music and then I'm like wow now I have
xbox music and google play music and
Spotify and Apple music that's why I
mean obviously it's because we're
reviewing products but and that's just
to cover music I mean then you had a
netflix and hulu and amazon prime's
annual like i said it's well worth it
that's like the one that i feel like if
i had to give up everything i still keep
prime yeah i thought there's no way I
would ever get rid of prime and nope no
II wasn't hurt I had to get doggie pads
yes sir
booty pads will baby at home and it's
like it what do i do drive to the pet
store which is probably a half hour away
or amazon prime and it'll be here
tomorrow yeah Oh unless i get plus i get
the videos and all kinds of other stuff
em exactly from jeff k what do you find
more impressive Samsung's third-quarter
surgeon profit or Apple's
record-breaking profits I actually I
wrote I was the one that wrote up the
Samsung story this morning and first I
and the this is one of those situations
where it'd be so easy to call me an
apple fanboy but I am simply talking
numbers Samsung has had seven
consecutive quarters of down reports
it's great that they had an up quarter
it was not it this way I love is
everything I read was about well the
phones aren't doing what they used to do
and you know they're making this many
more chips where all the other
departments of Samsung Samsung makes
everything I think they're billed as
separate companies in some cases like I
think samsung display is a separate
company okay that's why I had to wonder
because there's no mention of like the
televisions or the you know the
appliances or I mean but like when we're
at CES when we go into the to the
Samsung mega booth everything's under
one everything right yeah so it's hard
to realize where what falls work um I I
think though Samsung's put itself in an
interesting position and I mentioned
this briefly in the article you know if
their phone sales her down that's fine
because that means someone else is
selling that many more phones and
they're making the chips that are in
that phone right right so they've got
you coming or going and so yay to me the
Samsung profits means a healthier mobile
market than anything yeah I agree with
that I also think in regards to
specifically mobile / samsung they've
done a really good job starting with the
s6 moving forward putting a focus on
premium products
I don't know what I was also use the
word margins how much they're making off
of each unit sold and how that compares
to apple and I think that's where you
start to get into who's more impressive
and profits is how they're making their
money and I don't know what the
breakdown for that is but I think Apple
to bounce back I mean Samsung to bounce
back sure like I think that's probably
the more impressive of it too coming
from slumps back into the game because
you've seen a lot of companies struggle
with that I mean HTC for example has
gone back and forth blackberry
especially and I'm excited to see that
android phone I don't know if that's
going to do much but it's Sony it seems
like a dangerous market right now where
if you get your head into a slump how
the heck you get out of it and see
Samsung bounce back nice from section
bajo all will there ever be a time where
Apple doesn't have a successful quarter
yeah I mean it's happened before yeah
its history yeah I don't know when I
don't ups and downs if I if I knew that
sort of stuff actually play the stock
market hey well one of the things is you
look at and this is she going back to
freshman economics you look at an asset
and necessary Goodrich just say like a
luxury good so if we were to go into a
down economy where people can't afford
these iphones and apples spending
billions of dollars making these new
expensive iPhones and then nobody buys
them that might be a troubling quarter
for Apple ya know there's a lot of
things that you spend in your selling
premium products and they're attractive
then you can do well from Davis tap
another market based question is there
any evidence that carrier exclusives
like the droid line actually bring more
people to the network I know at work
trade teen phone was the only called a
smartphone you know that's something
I've wondered a lot I don't think there
really is any phone out there other than
the iphone that would could be a carrier
exclusive and make somebody go Oh
I'm dropping my current carrier because
I got to have this one phone yeah I
think this was more back in the day and
even early Android and around time of
iphones to specifically android and
before that where phone makers were
making very very different products so
you would have a feature phone that had
like speakers on it you know and
thinking of an old samsung phone the
header people remember the samsung phone
on verizon it was like a lipstick tube
and it was really thin like this and
sort of flipped around I think that's
where you saw and actually even the old
razors where you saw people going
between carriers because they wanted a
specific phone and I wouldn't be
surprised I saw a rumor Esther I don't
remember who wrote it it was on Twitter
that maybe these are the last two roids
on verizon the droid branded phones and
I could see that making sense because I
don't Davis I don't see people going
from carrier to carrier for specific
handsets anymore no I think that's a
thing of the past I think if we saw you
know Verizon and Sprint were the only
carriers with the galaxy s6 and galaxy
s6 edge and people were really after
those funds then you might have seen
that and there were times I actually
remember the first time that samsung
sold their flagship on all four carriers
and the head of communications was like
I never want to go through that again
because it was such a pain in the butt
by now of course its standard they have
their flagship on all four carriers
every single year and multiple flagship
but back then it was very different why
I love is when I carrier has an
exclusive color yeah for retailers like
a red red or the blue phones &amp;amp; best buy
sometimes yeah yeah i'm going to change
my buying habits for a color right yeah
that's not happening from men of and
kumar should i get samsung note 5 or
wait for Samsung s7 and do you think
note 5 will get updates in coming years
um if you mean will there be a note 6
yes that's a tough question I mean it
depends on
a your needs at this moment how you use
the phone and see just how much screen
real estate you need yeah it's one of
those tough question always is the late
game I mean you can wait because then
you'll have a year before worrying about
the galaxy s eight presuming me
continuing to go down online and you
have a long time until the note 6 note 5
is really good though and the s7 like
you're saying presumably will have a
smaller display so really you serious
yeah it's gonna be great fun note 5 is a
great phone and will continue to be a
great fun yeah I agree I agree it's very
much use k space though for sure uh from
Jonas KO how does the droid turbo
shatterproof screen field since you've
actually had the opportunity to touch it
yeah so I played with you yesterday and
the thing keep in mind that when we're
playing with the phones it's like I
think you know 20 minutes with the
device and that's crowded and people
want it and then you got to go get the
max also and film at but to me it felt
like a regular old display which is I
which I was saying earlier in the in the
call seems pretty awesome given that
it's resistant to shattering I don't
want to say shatterproof or maybe it's
shatterproof but uh you know I think it
can still be damaged Oh somebody on
YouTube will find out yeah the shooter
with a shotgun i'm sure it'll do yeah
somebody will one of those gun guys will
for sure take it out from such a Mahal
off topic do you guys collect anything
besides gadgets IE Funko pop vinyl
figures coin collection special comic
book covers etc I collect way too much
stuff I don't think I really collect
anything I've hobbies fishing so you
collect fish yeah no but I don't really
catch fish that's the problem I collect
stuff related to
disease haunted mansion I selectively
collect comic book statues I selectively
collect still some comic books yeah
collecting has always been a problem for
me I need to seek therapy for that
someday from George day what can YouTube
due to make youtube read something I
actually want that's an excellent
question well that's a scary thing to
that's where you're just saying maybe
they grow ads all over the priest at
worst then now you're like I can't deal
with this now I gotta pay for you to
read but not because you actually want
to but because that's where stuff is I
hope that doesn't happen yeah last
question for the day comes from adam
McDonald's do you think services like
Phi will take off I think eventually
there'll be a good option I don't think
they're going to be mean consider it
runs on tmobile and Sprint's networks so
I don't think Google's goal is to say
you know we're replacing them because
they need them unless the Phi I mean I'm
not phi fibre rollout eventually gives
them something a backbone to work off of
but then they have to get all the
spectrum too i don't i don't know i
think it's gonna be more of like an
option rather than this mass appeal
thing yeah I tend to agree plus project
Phi or not project fiyah I keep mixing
them up fiber a Phi is the reason that
the Royals Mets game last night went out
I think right pretty crazy no I actually
right up on that they also do remember
I'm just talking about headlines and saw
this morning so I probably know the
electricity to the TV truck failed and
then both generators failed at the exact
same time Google Fiber went out but it
was not connected to what was happening
at the stadium oh ok that sounds like
hacking or something I don't know I
quick to completely off topic grant I i
love Kansas City it's one of my favorite
cities ever however when you stand in
Kansas City hotels I do every time
before I fly out
there's a dollar fifty tax which used to
state explicitly was four and now
they've kind of disguised it but you
stay in a Kansas City hotel you get
charged a dollar fifty tax that's the
stadium tax okay that's how they decide
to pay off arrowhead stadium and the
royal Stadium is by oh if you come to
town for to visit guess what you're
helping with our stadiums those teams
are taught that's you know that's how
they sometimes don't get bill cos nobody
wants to do well at least it wasn't like
st. Louis that WOD the entire state to
pay for their new Ram stadium death oh
that was a crazy idea anyway Baz gotta
