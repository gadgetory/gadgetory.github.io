recently Apple in my opinion is in a
very interesting place they're in a
place where I believe that they are very
far behind the rest of the market and
yet in a way it almost doesn't seem to
matter their products seem to get sort
of less and less innovative as we keep
moving forward and yet the hype and the
marketing becomes more and more
impressive they put you in a place where
you're really questioning before they
announce a product is a color like jet
black going to be enough for me to drop
out drop all this cash on this brand new
phone and traditionally I would say the
answer is no a new color isn't that
interesting and yet there's something
about the way Apple does it where it
almost is now a lot of you guys have
seen my videos about switching back and
forth between iOS and Android this video
is not about that this video is not
about life preferences honestly while
I'm not that pumped about this iPhone
the new iPhone is gonna be more than
good enough for the most people out
there who are gonna be buying it the
average consumer
it's not gonna be tech enthusiasts dream
however it will be more than good enough
for every single person who is pumped
about Apple who's gonna go buy it
because it's the new thing and then not
think about it for the rest of the year
or two years that they do use it so yet
despite my lack of enthusiasm about this
new iPhone I did almost buy one and so
did almost every single other person to
curate TechnoBuffalo and here's why we
were watching that livestream and when
that iPhone 7 promo came on with the jet
black colors and even the commercials
that came out afterwards whenever I
found myself watching one of those
commercials released by Apple I was so
pumped about what they were announcing
what they were releasing that I almost
forgot about any of the specs the price
anything to do with the phone it was
just purely an emotional decision that I
was going to make I was like I'm ready I
got my wallet ready I'm gonna go buy
this thing right now it looks that
awesome same thing applies to the Apple
watch that being said it's almost like
the less impressive Apple's product get
the more impressive their marketing and
height becomes those new promos are
insane if you haven't checked them out I
highly recommend checking them out
beautiful pieces of filmmaking and
that's what they are they're like films
they're like the story of the product
and you watch and you're like yep I'm on
board I'm totally on but I'm totally
gonna get my new Apple watch and go
swimming in the ocean and go running up
a hill even though I never go running
and this isn't to say that no other
phone has never had a
ad campaign I remember Droid had a
pretty good series going motox had a
good little commercial that was kind of
fun and about making your own phone it
was kind of all modular and weird with
the back of the design the colors but
what Apple has done is build their brand
repeatedly literally from the color
dancing ad campaigns of the iPod all the
way up to these cinematic videos of the
iPhone 7 there's something about their
brand that is so consistent that it sort
of been exponential the effect of
drawing you into the Apple brand has
been exponential over the years because
they've built on it so effectively now
there's obviously gonna be two sides to
this the one side is going to be you
either think that Apple makes the
greatest campaigns and so that's why
they're a bad company because they're a
tech company they should be focusing on
products or you're on the other side
where you understand that selling and
marketing is a part of business and that
if this is something they're doing well
that means they're succeeding as a
business so props to them I kind of see
both sides of the argument I don't
really fall on one side it's just insane
to me how strong the effect and the draw
is even on people within the industry
when we know very well how unimpressive
the products are at least on a spec
sheet or even in usage nowadays when a
lot of other phones are good or even
better and so that's pretty much it for
this video guys let me know what you
think in the comments down below are you
a fan of what Apple is doing from a
marketing standpoint or even from a
product standpoint I'm always curious to
hear give us a thumbs up if you liked
