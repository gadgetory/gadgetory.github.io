unboxing for you of the just released
PSP go let's go ahead and take a look
and see what we have we've got a sticker
on the front letting you know there's a
free version of rock band that you can
download and buy download I should say
that this version of the PSP ditches the
last generations Universal Media disc or
UMD so this actually has no really game
cartridge or slot or no place to put in
optical media it is completely digital
everything is done through the
PlayStation Network and all games are
downloaded which is kind of neat
encouraged to see how it's going to work
so PSP go on the front picture of the
device on the side another picture
nothing fancy there on the back just
your sort of warranty information about
it and on the last side it's letting you
know that it's got a Wi-Fi Bluetooth
charges via USB and I uses memory stick
for expand on that 16 gigs let's go
ahead and open it up we'll use the
unnecessarily large knife to cut the
plastic hopefully I don't cut my finger
with the plastic well that would make
for a good video guy blood ease himself
opening up a box alright so I think I
got that open yep go ahead and pull up
the tab and there is the PSP go I've
actually not yet seen one of these put
that off to the side for just one second
see what else comes to the box so there
is that rock band unplugged the voucher
there's some coupon codes and another
game pad upon to you should be able to
download a lot of the old PSP games Sony
and sang right over this new PlayStation
Network so that should be interesting
here's the charger power looks like
there usb on the side and indeed there
it is there's a power cable and it's
actually the dual port
let's dick do this quickly take a look
at the actual device USB cable and just
the books and warranties stuff that come
with a QuickStart guide blah blah blah
and a media go disk whether they could
give you a disk for it's funny on a
device in a console it touts itself as
not eating discs they give you one of
the box but enough of that let's take a
look at the PSP Go itself it's actually
very small let's peel off the plastic
won't feel a lot smaller hand and I
expect you to joke
very glossy thing is going to be a
fingerprint magnet there's a little bit
of tape on top on the shoulder buttons
well and let's see how the stacks up
size-wise to some other devices you may
be familiar with here we've got the
iPhone 3GS so you can see size-wise it's
not that much bigger
although thickness wise is going to be a
little bit different and that's because
this actually slides out and lets you
control it via this new designed keypad
here it is size-wise next to the new
iPod Nano you can see that you've seen
the Nano you don't have thin and small
it is PSP Go is not that much bigger
turn it off to the side and you can see
the thickness so let's take a look at
the console itself and I will boot it up
so you've got the screen on the front
that's certainly not a yet not a
touchscreen does appear to be quite
large I don't have the dimensions right
now you've got your power button
you got some speaker buttons Bluetooth
and Wi-Fi indicators you've got your
volume music control button and a
dedicated hard button your two shoulder
buttons on the back really nothing you
can see it's already leaving a little
bit dusty slide it up
you've got your d-pad your PlayStation
sort of triangle and square buttons and
a well a pattern that looks very
recessed almost like a joystick that you
can find on the last generation PSP and
PlayStation consoles a little bit more
recess that I like but not bad and the
start and select buttons let's power
this thing on and see how it looks let's
go ahead and slide that power bud
little green light see if it came with
any sort of charge
little Sony Computer Entertainment
looks like it's telling you that you
need to slide it open so we'll do that
click you go through the typical
language selections here so we'll go
down to English when set my time
I'll skip the initial setup here and
I'll show you guys a real quick view of
the UI okay so the initial setup is
complete you just have to create a
nickname and set your birth date and
time and you get a very familiar looking
sort crossbar interface that you'll know
from the ps3 stay tuned to the channel
for a full overview of the operating
system the web browser the games how you
buy games download speeds really
