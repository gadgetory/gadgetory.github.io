John Breton Durkin TechnoBuffalo here in
UI phone loving or iPhone hating folks
out there the day you have been waiting
to cheer or gear is here
October 4th mark it on your calendar app
will set down invitations for a press
event on their Cupertino campus it's
going to start at 10:00 a.m. on Tuesday
October 4th what are they gonna announce
to save that for an upcoming predictions
video but we are finally going to put
the rumors to rest whether or not it's
an iPhone 5 and iPhone 4s they decide to
call it an iPhone 4G decide to call an
iPhone 12 it's like to call it an iPhone
woful decided to call it an iPhone
sandwich whatever they decide to call it
we are going to be covering the whole
shebang bang and that is actually a
technical Apple term will be live
blogging the entire event starting at
10:00 a.m. Pacific time so that's a 1:00
a.m. Eastern Time 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time
I don't know what time zone you're in so
you're gonna have to do that math but
what do you guys expect Apple to
announce are you looking forward to
upgrading do you not care I want to know
what you guys have to say the invitation
didn't really give much away I list the
standard sort of Apple icons that we've
seen in the past where they were won by
the phone perhaps leading us to believe
that we're just going to have one phone
and we're not going to have an iPhone 5
or not gonna have an iPhone 4s once let
you guys know though that the
announcement is here predictions and all
that good stuff coming up very soon I'm
John Breton Jordan TechnoBuffalo
