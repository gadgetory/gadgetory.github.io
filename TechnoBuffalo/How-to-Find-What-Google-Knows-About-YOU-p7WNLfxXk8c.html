I thought maybe I'd be like hey let me
let me tell you a scary ghost story
about a company that knows everything
about you and I thought maybe I'll just
do like a PSA but I want to share with
you guys is how much Google knows about
you how you can see what Google knows
about you and most importantly what you
can do about it and I'm not sure as
information to scare anyone out there a
lot of you might already know that
information exists
me personally I knew it was there but I
know the breadth of what Google actually
knows about me that's part of what makes
Google and Android work that they can
use to breath this information to
customize the experience for you so
which I got to find out what Google
knows about you check out my activity
google.com and we'll link all to the
stuff down below the caveat here is you
have to be signed into an account for
Google to to track you and not be using
incognito window and there you'll be
greeted by an incredibly scary history
of what Google knows so we're talking
about this in the office about what
Google knows about you and one of our
editors Niven was like hey I able to
check all the stuff that Google is aware
of feels like oh I'd be curious to know
if they know about me and I saw it and
then my jaw like hit hit the floor he
was telling me like hey you know that it
records everything you say we do ok
Google and then I saw the audio tracks
and I hit play and it was him saying
that sentence that just ended was
already showing up it is incredible the
breath information that's tracked you're
tracked much more heavily when using
Android it'll tell you every app you've
opened the time you opened it where you
were when you open that app everything
you search for every YouTube video
you've watched is all there and to
Google's credit they do give you the
option to filter or delete things that
they know or limit what they see about
you the caveat there though is that your
experience with Android or Google as a
whole might not be as complete as maybe
Google would like that's not all Google
knows about you google.com slash map
slash timeline gets even a little bit
like stalkery creepy it'll tell you
where you were not only like the
location like the city like the
restaurant you are at who you are with
and pictures that were taken so I went
back and check that history when I
reviewed the notes that
I was on vacation with my family fit
into that review and it's told me that I
was in Hawaii they told me what
restaurant I was sitting at in Hawaii
and then it showed me the pictures that
I took while I was there it also knew
when I flew home it is incredibly
comprehensive and sort of borderline
like you need a restraining order and
again I don't want to scare anyone out
there but I do want you to be aware of
what Google knows about you presumably
about Apple and other companies know
about you Google just being more open
about cheering it so I don't want to
sort of yell at Google and say they're
the giant devil because at least being
opened up what they know Apple and
others a little more secretive about
sort of what they know about you I'm
gonna leave out a comment to the day
from this video because I want to focus
on the comments for this particular
video which I think are really relevant
now so again let me know down below what
you think video a thumbs up if you are
worried about security to the next time
