from TechnoBuffalo here with an unboxing
of the Sierra Wireless 4G tri-five
hotspot when one fire to fly is not
enough Sprint's got you covered so this
is obviously a mobile hotspot that does
Abdo so that's the 3G it does WiMAX for
4G and it will eventually do LTE once
the network is here for another version
of 4G so all the network Sprint's
support set for some super old legacy
ones this guy is going to be able to
take in and suck out his Wi-Fi let's go
ahead and see if it works
all right so here's the box typical sort
of newsprint packaging very
environmentally friendly it's available
now 99 bucks it's a two-year contract or
349 bucks if you want to buy it just
outright go ahead take off the lid boom
it's been deleted here is the Tri Phi
hot spot pretty decently sized we'll see
I'm curious see if there's a SIM card in
here actually for four LT even though
Spirit doesn't have their network on yet
see also gonna have get started all you
need to know to get started we need to
read that who reads manuals anymore
we've got just an absolutely gargantuan
battery which also it looks like it
serves as the back this is a 3,600
milliamp hour battery it's gonna be good
for eight hours of use or eight weeks of
standby thing is giant imagine putting
that thing into a phone think it'd be a
brick but you definitely be able to get
through a full day cos we're gonna have
in the box we've got it's like in the
back so we're gonna have a hump back for
this get it like a whale and then we've
got the power cable which is just a
little brick and it's of the micro USB
variety so pretty standard there and
Sprint's always really good about
including bags recycling devices if you
throw your old cell phones or batteries
the garbage they go to landfills and the
battery juice will get all technical
yeah can leak out I know battery juice
isn't real don't leave it in the
comments alright so let's go ahead and
take a look at this guy so here it is I
don't see any SIM card in here well
maybe it's embedded err
those were the micro card would go so
you can actually use this for wireless
storage no SIM card he said I could see
usually removed so maybe it's hidden or
maybe once spring has some cards they
will release them so go ahead and pop
that back in we'll put on our humpback
with a figure goes like this and of
course since this is a mobile hotspot we
got to do a speed test so let's go ahead
and power it on let's see we got
actually on the sides there's where you
charge in power
there's your WPS and looks like there's
a power switch
and that's about it this is sort of a
soft touch feel to it this is not a
little device in the world of hotspots
this is a large device in about the
hotspots but if you need something
that's going to work on pretty much
every network that the particular
carrier offers in this case print it's
gonna be a good option for you there
isn't LCD screen there but unfortunately
we've never enough power to turn it on
so I'm gonna go ahead and plug this guy
in juice it up and see if we can get
some speed test be back in just a minute
all right so we've got this guy juiced
up we got the Sprint logo powering up
and not the sprint slogan I just let me
know what it's doing if you have a
full-color LCD display here 3G 4G sprint
is nice so this does every network so if
you got WiMAX by you hey you're gonna be
set if you hopefully any one of the LTE
market you're gonna be set or if you've
got Sprint's albeit not overly fast 3G
Abdo network now you'd be able to use
that here as well so 4G LTE Wi-Fi
hotspots booting up I know it's booting
up because it's playing a game of snake
with itself and it keeps losing don't go
go go up and it just keeps losing so
what's this kind of boot up I will test
beams here in just a moment
better this big you figure it's got
plenty of juice Logan right imagine that
a phone power saver
yeah and that's fine 4G networks not
found press Start to search alright it's
a 4G networks not found press Start to
search or press power to search
searching for 4G LTE network so it must
be a SIM card in there but it's not
gonna find 4G LTE because Sprint don't
have it yet I know it's not found it's
going to take it out Power Save mode I
think that's maybe what that is so
perhaps that's why you should read the
instructions there we go so found
something reporting update status to
server press to cancel so showing 4G so
it's probably pulling in WiMAX and you
have WiMAX here in Southern California
or just where I'm at and when I do get
to network speed certainly it's gonna
vary depending on where you are in your
location I'm in Southern California
depending on the time of day
without their clouds how many people on
your network what the network feels like
but not you had a healthy breakfast and
all kinds of stuff that obviously come
with the caveat so I'm doing Network to
be test so keep that in mind now I see
you in the comments down below I get X
and O speeds so you're wrong and have a
dumb face just to show what speeds are
here so we are connected to the sprint
hotspot I'm just using an iPhone here
for testing purposes let's go to one of
my favorite apps that is speed tests and
see what we are looking at again just
for fun does say we're connected over 4G
there and that is why max so let's see
how quick that's going to work
now you can configure the network name
in the password as well I will just go
to sprint hotspot and go through a few
settings pretty easy to do and we are
getting pretty decent WiMAX speeds
actually we're using 4G speeds overall
so 5 megabits down and let's think we'll
probably get one ish up the 5 down is
pretty comparable with actually LTE
speeds around here in Southern
California the ups a little bit slower
usually we get about one to two up but
certainly serviceable so this is a
awesome maybe I'm going to eat a little
bit of crow surprising a useful device
here with WiMAX and one sprint gets LTE
perhaps this might be a good device to
carry around in your bag so other doc
that's gonna be worth it for you you
know you're gonna have to decide it
definitely comes in at a relatively
reasonable price point 99 bucks or you
just buy it outright at 349 use it for
as long as you want sell it and pay your
dad a month a month that's an option as
well
certainly they'll probably recommend
waiting until LTE comes to you before
you pick one of these bad boys up anyway
guys I'm John retinue from TechnoBuffalo
and I will see you in the next video
buh-bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
