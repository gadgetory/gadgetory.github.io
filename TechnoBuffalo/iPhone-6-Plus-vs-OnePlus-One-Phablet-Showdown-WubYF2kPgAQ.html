to you by full sail what's going on guys
a m√§rklin sanger from TechnoBuffalo and
today we'll be comparing the iphone 6
plus and the oneplus one will be talking
things like build quality cameras
battery life performance and overall see
which 5.5 inch comes out on top when you
think about the iphone 6 plus vs 1 plus
1 the first thing that strikes in your
mind is how completely different these
two devices are while one is the epitome
of luxury the other is the underdog de
flagship killer design and build quality
both the iphone 6 plus n1 plus 1 have
premium quality builds and are designed
to be light and slim devices iphone 6
plus is a tad bit taller and wider than
the one and it's noticeably thinner than
the one to the six bus is made out of
aluminum while the one is made out of
high quality plastic and since the
iphone 6 plus is so thin and wide it's
more uncomfortable to use one-handed
whereas the one fits comfortably in my
hand thanks to its curved back and slim
profile you have three color options to
choose from for the iphone 6 plus space
grey gold and silver whereas the one
plus one is only available in sandstone
black and so quite the iphone 6 plus
starts at two hundred ninety nine
dollars up to four hundred ninety nine
dollars for the two-year contract and
749 eight forty nine and nine forty nine
dollars off contract which is
ridiculously expensive the oneplus one
on the other hand starts at just two
hundred ninety nine dollars for the 16
gigabyte model off-contract and goes up
to three hundred forty nine dollars for
the 64 gigabyte model that's a huge
price difference and the quality you get
for just three hundred forty nine
dollars is astounding in terms of specs
iphone 6 plus has a 5.5 inch retina HD
display with the resolution of 1920 x
1080 and a pixel density of 401 ppi it's
equipped with apple's new dual core a8
chip in one gigabyte of ram an NFC chip
which can only be used for apple pay at
the moment a 2915 milliamp battery and
non-expandable options of 16 64 or 128
gigabytes there's a new 8 megapixel
iSight camera with optical image
stabilization in the back that can
record in 1080p 60 frames per second and
slow motion 720p at 240 frames per
second the iphone 6 plus also carries
more LTE bands in the oneplus
meaning it can connect more LTE networks
around the globe achieve faster LTE
speed and it also supports volte the
iphone six-plus still carries touch ID
which seems to be much better and faster
on iOS 8 the oneplus one on the other
hand is rocking a 5.5 inch IPS display
with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 and a
pixel density of 401 ppi it's packing a
beastly 2.5 gigahertz quad-core
snapdragon 801 processor with 3
gigabytes of ram a huge 3100 milliamp
battery and 16 gigabyte or 64 gigabyte
of non-expandable storage there's a 13
megapixel camera on the back that's
capable of recording 4k video and slow
motion 720p at 120 frames per second the
1+1 is also running cyanogenmod 11 s
based on android 4.4 which brings a lot
of great software tweaks to make the
user experience so much better talking
about the cameras first both are great
13 megapixel vs 8 megapixel seems like a
huge deal but it's really not I love the
camera on the oneplus one and I think
it's one of the better cameras I've
tried on any Android device this year
the iphone 6 plus in my opinion is just
the better camera colors are more
accurate it's not two contrasting and it
handles exposures really well thought of
focus is faster too thanks to its focus
pixel technology and there's less
artifacts and noisy medium to low-light
photos and images taken by the six plus
compared to the one plus one if you want
to see all of our sample photos check
out the gallery at technobuffalo com for
more moving on to battery life the one
plus one is equipped with a three
thousand one hundred million battery
whereas the iphone 6 plus only has two
thousand nine hundred fifteen million
battery now I had the chance to use the
oneplus one as my personal phone for a
few months and the battery life blew me
away I'd push email enabled i was
playing games watching videos and use
the camera a ton and the battery would
last about two days whereas the iphone
six-plus would only last about 17 or so
hours which isn't terrible by any means
but it could be better especially for
phone this size your mileage will
definitely vary depending on your usage
but the oneplus one definitely best the
iphone 6 plus in this category let's
take a quick break from this video and
thank our friends over at full sail as
you know virtually every industry relies
on software technology and full sail
university offers bachelor's degree
program that addresses the need for
skilled tech professionals through
curriculum that blends code and theory
would real-world experience whether
you're into
web design making apps and or software
in general Full Sail will teach you the
fundamentals in all of these courses on
campus or online if you want to learn
more about full sails web and Technology
programs visit Full Sail edu /
technobuffalo and again that's Full Sail
edu / TechnoBuffalo when it comes to
software Santa chamada is one of the
main reasons why the one plus one is so
great you have the ability to pretty
much customize every part of the phone
from the home screen to the lock screen
and you can easily install new themes
icons and fonts and much more all the
Google services comes pre-installed on
the 12 meaning you have access to apps
like Gmail Google Maps Google Play Store
and even Google now which is always
great to have iOS is great too don't get
me wrong the overall UI is very user
friendly and overall very simple iOS 8
also added a bunch of new features like
third-party keyboards third-party
extensions widgets a notification center
and continuity which allows iPhones iPad
and Mac to seamlessly work together for
a better and more seamless experience
now I'd love to customize my phone
whether it's cases and or software
related I want to be able to customize
my phone the way I wanted to and I think
cyanogenmod definitely beats iOS in this
category performance-wise there's not
much to complain about both they both
perform like a champ and even though the
1+1 is equipped with a quad-core
processor and 3 gigabytes of RAM I
didn't really see any noticeable
difference between the two one is
running iOS and the other is running
cyanogenmod and it's pretty hard to
compare performance on two different
operating systems I browse the web with
multiple tabs on both the one and the
six plus i watch movies on netflix made
cause and play plenty of games and never
once that either slow down on me so to
wrap things are for you guys as it's
often the case with iOS versus Android
battles it mostly boils down to which
operating system you prefer I'm leading
slightly in favor the iphone 6 plus just
because it fits in what I do on an
everyday basis I love the oneplus one
and it's the first non apple device that
I absolutely love the battery life on
this is the best I've seen on a
smartphone and Santa Jamal 11s makes
user experience that much better of
course if you love iOS or all things
apple then iphone is your personal
winner but if you're open to android and
want a cheap android flagship device
then the oneplus one has the price the
software and hardware features that
might win you over anyways that's it for
