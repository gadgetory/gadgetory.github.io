TechnoBuffalo I'm here at Aoife in
Berlin checking out the Alcatel OneTouch
go watch it's a new water and dust
resistant watch that will pair nicely
with the go play that's also water and
dust resistant but here the story is
about the interchangeable covers and
bands you can see behind me I've got
various ones here and there's the shell
and the emotion so I just held it on to
the go button there you can tell me
something to do so it says go scream and
from there I can share it to social
networks or something like that but the
idea is that it'll tell me what to do
you know whether it's go swim or go jump
or go do something go on a roller
coaster it looks like there that's sort
of telling you to go do something quick
look around the watch there you've got
the heart rate monitor on the back the
bands are usually swappable they just
sort of slide out and again they'll sell
various ones so here I have the blue but
there's white and then the the covers
pop off too so you have just the gray
base right there then you can change it
out otherwise the hardware is very
similar to what we saw on the original
smart and watch from Alcatel One Touch
so you got similar software it's just
sort of been spiced up a bit with some
more functions anyway that's a quick
look here at the go watch this is Todd
