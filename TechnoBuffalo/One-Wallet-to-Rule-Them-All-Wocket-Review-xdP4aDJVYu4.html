to you by domain.com so for the past 10
days I have had a wocket in my pocket
this is the wocket smart wallet the
world's first smart wallet the company
claims it's a self-contained smart card
and wallet combo so you need a smart
phone in order to make this work
everything you need you can do right
from this contraption including the
touchscreen but is it really worth your
229 bucks and could it possibly replace
your wallet those are the things that I
set out to answer and I think I've got
it all sorted so I've been really
interested in the smart card smart
wallet technology for a while this is
the third in our series of covering the
products that are available right now
we've covered coin and we've covered
Stratus and of course now we've got the
walk it wallet on the other two
competitors and to the market plastic
and swipe be sure to cover those as well
so here is the walk it it's $229
essentially all-encompassing smart
wallet the idea behind this and the big
thing about why the company claims this
is better than a smart card is you don't
need your phone to make this work the
setup is pretty easy you plug in a 3.5
millimeter adapter to the bottom this
you pull off the plastic swipe your
cards in and you are good to go you can
also put in your rewards cards as well
it makes it unique is that it has a full
functioning touchscreen touchscreen
works very well is very responsive the
idea here in the process is very simple
take aside your pocket you type in your
PIN you select what cards you want and
about two seconds later you can slide
this card out at the back and this is
now programmed to be the card that you
wanted it to be the cool thing here
about the wonkin is a screen so if you
want to show the vendor your card
information they want to know what
security code is or the last four you
can very easily show them you put it
right back in the walk it and if the
automatically turns itself off and the
car is going to wipe itself so there's
no information surround this card unless
you're giving it to somebody that's the
idea and in practice it works pretty
well I will use this about 20 or so
times and with one exception at one gas
station it did work every time so
already we're a step above what we saw
with coin and about on par with success
rate we saw of Stratus we don't live in
an ideal world and in reality there are
definitely some problems with the walk
it the first one is just time take this
out of your pocket to put in your PIN
select the card you want and pull it out
it's about a thirty second process it
doesn't sound that long but you
prepare to just taking a card at your
wall and heading to somebody it's
definitely something you need to get
used to the second issue we ran into
really with all smart cards trying to
explain what the heck does is doesn't
have a visa logo on a MasterCard
American Express there's a lot of
explanation best to go in with this so
you have to say this is a Visa card this
is an Amex card to swipe it like you
ordinarily would and then they'll go and
do that and I think the biggest problem
with it is just its sheer size walk it
promise accessories I would go with it
we could put in other cards you can put
in some cash and I think you're carrying
a wallet but those aren't available yet
so all you have is one single pallet
there's not nearly enough to carry your
license some cash keep a couple other
credit cards as backup it's just not
going to work so you end up carrying the
wocket and the wallet you look at this
thing it's not the thinnest in the world
it becomes a bit unwieldy and also
another problem with it is this still
does everything that a smart card does
but much much much bigger and the idea
is that you don't have to have your
smartphone or to work but I always have
my phone with me and I'm guessing you
guys probably always have your phone in
your pocket as well so I'd much rather
has something that's this size is both
something that's this size in my pocket
I think the issue with the wocket is
that you have to adapt your life to hit
instead of it adapting to you I think if
smart cards are trying to do and now
obviously it's not all bad like I said
it worked almost every time but I think
you still need to be firing a hundred
percent in order to really feel
comfortable taking this out with you and
leaving your credit cards at home and
until you feel under percentage they're
going to carry other cards with you as
backup and there's no room for that
right now
now walking can certainly rectify that
and they could release their accessory
alignment they've been saying is going
to be coming we have pockets and pouches
it's sort of fold this up and have it be
into your wallet but right now as this
filming in early August that is not yet
available
another issue that we've got with this
card is doesn't have any support for
chip-and-pin at least not yet a lot of
merchants are moving to support that
come October of 2015
and this is not going to offer there's
always going to be a typical magnetic
swipe and hopefully we'll see an update
soon but again as of this filming it's
not yet an option so this makes it
definitely not future-proof we stopped
real fast thank our peeps at domain.com
it's a place to go when the next great
idea hits you like in the middle of the
night so one-stop shopping for all your
domain name and web hosting email needs
the bank comm wants to hook you up with
a pretty sick offer save 20% on domain
names and web hosting when use coupon
code TechnoBuffalo it's all one word and
caps at domain comms check out when you
think domains think domain.com and as I
look at the competitive landscape coming
out for the smart cards their cards
coming and coming very soon that offer
touchscreen functionality on a card the
size of this we've got swipe we've got
plastic coming very soon and very eager
to try those and if those work as
advertised I can see very little reason
to justify spending two hundred and
thirty bucks on something this large it
also is always concerned as I put it my
back pocket or do my wallet I'm going to
crack that touchscreen now I haven't yet
and maybe that's me being paranoid but
I'm never going to feel confident taking
us out and keeping in my back pocket
again so I have felt more comfortable
putting on my front pocket that's
another sign that I have to adapt in my
life to suit to walk it so if you
interested in a smart card or this case
a smart wallet my recommendation is to
wait I can't recommend the walk it quite
yet perhaps his accessories come out as
a device gets thin down maybe it'll be a
little bit better but right now its
current iteration at its current price I
just don't think it's a good buy so what
I guys think do you agree disagree would
you use something like this is a
touchscreen cool to you let you define
it would be annoying which you prefer
sir the tapping method of Strato so
again if you want to see the coverage
we've done on the straddle to the coin I
will link those here as well and put
links to them down below and I think you
guys are watching hope you enjoyed the
next time john render from TechnoBuffalo
so guys next video
