from technobuffalo here i have shared my
life with you over the years you've seen
when i've gotten engaged when I got
married I announced in June that my wife
and I were going to have a baby and if
you're doing the math that would mean
the baby's going to be due sometime in
September's so if you are watching this
video that means i am now a father and i
am probably super tired with giant bags
under my eyes but probably the happiest
that I've ever been in my entire life I
cannot wait to be a father you can see
it's I keep going like this I don't take
a little bit of time off to be with my
wife and to learn how to change a diaper
and probably get pita on the face I'm
probably learned that a blowout is more
than what could happen to my tire but
we've got videos cued up that will
merely how be able to see my face you'll
see a lot more of Ashley of Todd over
the next couple weeks I'm gonna probably
take about two weeks off it'll be back
doing regular through video filming any
advice for new dad's up there I love to
hear of course when I come back I'll
share pictures and share my experiences
with what it's like being a new father
but you want to let you guys know and
scream share the exciting news right now
I'm filming this on sep tember sixth so
I don't know when you're gonna see it
but the babies do you see any time this
month it could happen so I'm nervous I'm
excited every time my phone rings I'd
like heart jumped I think it might be my
wife we've got our bags packed at home
ready to go the car seats already in the
car was missing the baby to put in it
and I I can't wait so thank you guys for
your patience as I take some time off to
be with my new family but I will be back
