no Buffalo here and I want to give you
my first impressions of the
just-released Halo Reach
it's about 145 in the morning California
time this came out an hour and 45
minutes ago and I've been playing it for
the better part of an hour and I want to
share my first thoughts with you so let
me preface this video if I look tired my
eyes with blood shots because I am and
they are it is late here in California
but I had to get my halo reach on to
share my thoughts with you guys the play
with some of you guys and just to talk
about the game in general so let's go
ahead and get started first this is a
prequel to the original halo trilogy I'm
not caning ODST as part of the trilogy
but if you wanted to do the initial four
games so this takes place before those
so we don't have Master Chief as our
main Spartan protagonist we have someone
by the name of noble six but it appears
that in true Halo form we didn't
actually see the protagonist face so we
just sort of see noble six hood it up
and ready to go but since this is a
prequel we do see a lot of Spartans
running wild and we do see their faces
both men and women which is kind of neat
so first of all I wondering why it's
called a halo reach are you reaching for
a gun
well the planet that we are trying to
save is call to reach and we're trying
to save it of course from the Covenant
and the UNSC and all of its Spartans
forces are trying to save it now this is
a lot like watching the movie Titanic
not because it's a sappy love story but
because you know what's going to happen
you know the ship's gonna go down you
know event Jason's is a prequel and you
know what happens to the rest of the
Spartan forces you know that at the end
of the game plan is going to fall
regardless but you still have that
glimmer of hope that maybe you can save
it and that is really done very nicely
of what appears to be a really cool
musical score which is very solemn
Brassard adds to the whole atmosphere of
the game graphics wise looks you very
improved from what we saw in Halo 3
halos previous or may not winning any
graphics awards neither as Halo Reach
but it does look very good and I think a
little bit better textures are very rich
the colors are very vivid the
backgrounds are bright you can
detail in the foreground as well
certainly the main aspect of this game
is going to be the multiplayer
multiplayer worlds are awesome and there
seems to be quite a few of them so while
this isn't gonna win graphics Game of
the Year
it's definitely going to be one of the
more fun games to play the campaign
clocks ended just about eight hours they
can't pan seems to be more of an add-on
to what you get with the multiplayer
world which are time to meet us when you
start the game to get it create your own
Spartan you can choose from a variety of
helmets and different things and you can
also choose good not you want to be a
man or a woman so if you are a lady
gamer you can play as a lady if you are
a cross-dressing gamer you can play as
lady or as a man depending on what you
choose or if you just want to play is
different sexes you can go ahead and do
that too okay you customize it for all
you want as you go and get achievements
you can unlock and get points
essentially to add new things to your
character that sort of can be bad as
Ivana they're only add functionality but
they do look kind of cool so there's a
new targeting system in Halo Reach
at least say also that I can't show
pictures and videos from in France a ton
of copyrights you have to deal with just
me talking to you instead of showing
videos so my apologies for that there's
a new charting system that shows you
when your gun is at the highest accuracy
sort of goes in and comes back out
I was super gross to see but that's what
it does do you don't even II do a real
game were not gonna be rocking two guns
you are just going to have one which is
sort of sucky and supposedly there are
battles in space where you fight in
ships so kind of neat there even though
it is a prequel we are gonna see some
new guns you're gonna see some new ships
you're gonna see some new gameplay and
possibly some new enemies the Covenant
here does not appear to be thinking any
English which makes didn't appear even a
bit more alien and evil I got the
needler guns and the all kinds of fun
stuff you'll love the original halo and
halo 2 and halo 3 and ODST we have a lot
of content here it looks to be a really
really fun game if you're a fan of the
Halo series you're gonna love Halo Reach
it's exactly what you would expect from
the next Halo game great gameplay
awesome multiplayer and what appears to
be really higher replay value
all right guys I'm gonna probably go
play a little bit more and
go to bed hope you enjoy the first
impression of halo retail of course be
doing a full review of the game and some
gameplay coverage as well as like keeps
going on but again it just came out a
few hours ago
