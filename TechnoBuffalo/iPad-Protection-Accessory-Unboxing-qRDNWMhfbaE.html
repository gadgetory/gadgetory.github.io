TechnoBuffalo here flows you that follow
the website or the youtube channel you
know that I'm a big fan of the iPad I've
been using it since launch day and also
on launch day I want to protect my
investment so i bought the apple case
and so say the upcoming review i am not
a fan it's very flimsy and does a crappy
job but the one thing it should do well
and that's protecting so I wanted to see
what other cases were available for the
iPad since again it's a pretty
significant investment that you want to
make sure you keep safe so I reached out
to the folks at my gear store calm I
like to see what inventory they had
available as far as ipad accessories so
let's go ahead and again i'm not sure
what they sent and also certain that
they'll be having more inventory sort of
as the ipad matures let's go ahead and
again i just took out shipping label
here sorry you guys are all probably def
at that point go ahead and bring seal
let's see what we got inside looks like
they threw and actually some iphone
stuff as well here's the text raw iphone
3g or iphone 3gs case it's kind of a
cool look on the back and again all the
stuff you can pick up from my gear score
my gear store except courtesy of those
folks and if I believe use keywords on
for lakers you're going to get a a
discount at to check out let's see what
else we got they've got a mo she looks
like a cleaning cloth up for the ipad or
your imac or monitor these are always
really nice to have a microfiber cloth
see what else little my gear store card
free shipping now available
hey dot B plus a rubber sleeve for the
iPads going to take that out and i'll be
doing full reviews on this stuff too so
you can sort of get a a better sense of
what things are what they look like you
can see what the best serve protection
for your ipad is damaging yep
essentially it's just a little bit of a
rubber sleeve to protect the ipad it's
got a decent amount of cushioning on the
back um and no service cream protection
on the front go ahead and put that off
but let's see what else we got we've got
the spec shield view protects from
scratches and smudges it's a screen
protector you've seen these all the time
for the iphone a sort of like an
invisible shield type thing i actually
have a view type protection on my ipad
both front and back something that i
think there's a really nice job at
protecting the screen and the back just
from scratches and smudges and cleans
actually a lot easier than the standard
screen so these things are very helpful
ahead and push that off let's keep
digging in here is bodyguards premium
scratch proof transparent film a pretty
similar idea protects the screen and
keeps your ipad safe next we've got sort
of what I was talking about before the
invisible shield this is the full body
again same thing keeps the scratches out
of it this is probably the premier model
for the protection again I use it on my
iPhone and i currently have it on the
ipad here looks to be pretty nice little
actually traveling carrying case for the
ipad almost like a little bit of a
briefcase there's something that i think
that i would probably use quite a bit
you know i like using the ipad on its
own without really being in a case a
service the sleeve that you put it in to
help protect it then offers a lot of
protection this will probably be sort of
my daily ipad connection let's slip it
in here and see how it does slides right
in zips up the top you get it hold it
here or just put it in your bag but i
feel like this offer is much much more
protection than the very flimsy apple
case so you
all of this with the invisible shield of
the spec and you've got a pretty nicely
protected device to getting push that
off to the side let's see what else the
folks in my gear store sent over like
we've got a clear snap-on cover custom
fit for the ipad so rubber protection go
ahead and snaps right on it's like it's
in Spanish and French let's see what
else the edge over here we've got clear
case with silicone grip custom fit for
the ipad it looks to be the same thing
just a silicone as opposed to rubber and
again i'll be showing you all these
things at work and doing a strip
demonstration of the accessories that
are available for the ipad and the guys
in jon rettinger from TechnoBuffalo hope
you enjoyed it and thank yous to the
folks at my gear store for sending all
the stuff over be sure to check them out
of course my gear store com anyway i'm
jon rettinger and i'll see you the next
video buh-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
