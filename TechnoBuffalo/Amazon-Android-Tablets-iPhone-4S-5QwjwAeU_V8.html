dec no buffalo here with my tech recap
of the day going through everything that
we put up on TechnoBuffalo and just the
general world of technology it was also
brought to my attention that my mom now
knows how to use youtube so mom hello
I'll try and not make this super dirty
like the rest of my videos alright so
let's start off with the big news at
audreanna posted via the boy genius that
Amazon is working on not one but two
tablets that was the big news what they
might be using to power these tablets is
the big news supposedly they are working
on to the first one using invidious
current Tegra 2 processor with this many
cores the second one using the next
generation caught l processor that's
their code name Superman reference I
guess for the Nerds amongst us that has
this many cores supposedly coming out
bit later once that platform is out so
what's been interesting is we've been
hearing whispers that perhaps amazon
tablets might be the first amazon amazon
android tablets android amazon got it
that might run on Intel's Atom processor
but those rumors appear to be next the
boy genius has had pretty good track
record when it comes to rumors amazon
certainly has the chops for a really a
complete ecosystem they've got the
Amazon App Store which might be sort of
a Trojan horse to get you into the
Amazon world they've got their cloud
music service amazon can really be a
tremendous competitor and force i think
in a tablet market their previous guess
only hardware the kindle was a huge
runaway success from android to apples
apple planning a major product
announcement this week maybe thursday is
the 10 year anniversary of Apple's first
retail store opening and there have been
rumors that employees are asking to work
being asked to work overnight and that
there's something coming I would not bet
the farm on any sort of iPhone 5 iPhone
whereas announcement I don't think we're
gonna see anything big we haven't heard
grumblings of something coming all
rumors are pointing towards the iphone
coming later on in the year in the
September timeframe so who knows what
it's gonna be um maybe you guys know
leave this comment down below I put up a
video this morning ask the Buffalo where
you can ask me anything you want tech or
personal and I answer them so we put a
post about once a week where you can ask
questions in the comments or you can
send them to me on twitter via at
TechnoBuffalo or at john for lakers with
pound ask the bee or hashtag has to be
or tic-tac-toe board asked the be
whatever you want to call it so that
happened la know our soundtrack detailed
listen to verse 6 track remix Joey put
up some interesting posts on LA noir
Shawn wanted to talk about Apple
offering free repairs to those that were
unfortunately had physical damage to the
property in the Japanese tsunami
probably the least of their problems but
it's nice Apple is least doing a little
bit of something for those folks that
were hit by that tragedy we also have a
new writer on board you might know him
the name might look familiar it is Mike
Pearlman mike has covered a ton of stuff
from technology as an expert in cameras
video cameras and things that snap
pictures all around huge talent and we
are really excited to have Mike on board
so wish him a welcome and it looks like
hopefully about 17 you guys I already
have next is a post by Sean could
Microsoft be preparing to buy Nokia
first nokia was gonna put Windows Phone
7 on their phones and now they're saying
that Microsoft's about to enter
negotiations to buy nokia or at least
buy Nokia's mobile division that could
be tremendous news nokia hasn't achieved
the market penetration that they have in
other parts of the world nokia sort of
been trying to get into the US market
with mixed success they have a huge
market share though in the rest of the
world certainly that
is market chair again as being chipped
away month by month and they're looking
to get back and remain there remain
regain their competitive edge I am
muffling up my words today we've got

iPhone 5 is practicing dead by audrianna
a lot of interesting stuff check out the
site and read them comment on them and
talk to us cuz if no one talked to as it
gets lonely and I don't like being
lonely I work from home I sit in an
office with a monitor all day it's my
only human interaction and prevents me
from becoming even more socially awkward
than I am right now so talk to me I
could use a conversation just say hey
John what's happening tell me a joke you
know whatever just say hi I read most of
the comments and all joking aside are
all not funny nest aside i am jon

going to stop being awkward now and i'll
