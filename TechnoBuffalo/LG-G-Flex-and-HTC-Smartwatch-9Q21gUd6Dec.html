to you by gamefly what's up everyone
welcome back there episode of a rumor
roundup I'm realest jon rettinger is the
show where i hoard all the rumors all
your rumors are belong to me and i serve
them up to you so you know what you
missed and over the technology what
might be coming in the coming weeks
months in even years of this week it's
all about the me toos HTC is looking to
build a SmartWatch LG's looking to get
into the curved smartphone market and
the galaxy s5 by get a pretty beastly 16
megapixel camera this rumor and up let's
get started so if you use the galaxy
gear and you thought I'd like your
Galaxy gear about it like you much more
if you're built out of aluminum well
looks like the folks at HCC might have
your answer according to Bloomberg they
are looking to get into the SmartWatch
world and not surprisingly run Android
and have a camera that was the leak
it'll run Android have a cam I could
have told you that but beyond its camera
the alleged smart water still in
development an interview earlier this
week CEO Peter Chou who's been pretty
outspoken said he wouldn't really smart
watch unless it can meet a need but with
Samsung going pretty much balls to the
wall and wearables HTC is obviously
feeling some pressure to follow quickly
or risk losing on a potentially
profitable brand new market so not to be
outdone by the galaxy round LG is
getting into the curb phone game to the
leak comes courtesy of Argentinian
journalist Frederico ET who somehow God
is a hot little hands on the rumored
phone so like Samsung's handset the
galaxy round eeny is reporting that the
G flex is it going to be called to lunch
exclusively in South Korea boo he sent a
ton of pictures the verdict reveal that
the vice buttons are also on the back
similar to the g two so kind of boo to
that the curse smartphone also
supposedly features a 13 megapixel
camera six inch OLED display curved on
its vertical access so i get it that
it's good of a Kurd phone but i have yet
to really understand what the point of a
Kurd phone is maybe it's your pocket
better perhaps there's some crazy new
thing I haven't thought of I know
samsung's galaxy around you can sort of
tap it and make it wiggle and menus pop
up I just
waiting's was more like a hey we can do
it the more we should do it I don't know
what the advantage of a curved display
is other than being like boom Lou should
be jelly at my phone or Oh your phone is
flat sucks for you I don't care if you
got a Snapdragon 800 mom's got a curve
in it samsung galaxy s5 is getting a 16
megapixel camera the Samsung has already
got some pretty baller phones out there
and they have pretty awesome specs
galaxy note 3 and the Galaxy s4 boasting
pretty substantial and decent 13
megapixel cameras but the company made
to keep improving if it wants to remain
competitive into 2014 it's a new report
from eTnews which is a pretty decent
tracker quen it comes to samsung rumors
claims at the next generation probably
named galaxy s5 will rock a 16 megapixel
camera which if you can do math is
double what we already got things will
allegedly take shape around the end of
the year because a camera module sample
tests have not yet been completed
however if Samsung insider from the
company's wireless business division
reportedly told ichi news at the galaxy
s5 could launch in early 2014 so january
