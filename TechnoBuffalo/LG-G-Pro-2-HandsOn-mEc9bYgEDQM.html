TechnoBuffalo I'm here in Barcelona for
Mobile World Congress checking out the
LG G pro 2 was announced recently and
now is our first time to check it out on
the back you can see they they took over
the g2 volume controls and power button
there's also a 13 megapixel camera and
it has 0 is optical image stabilization
that combines both hardware and software
features so I'll show you that real
quick when we get in but otherwise up
front here you have a Qualcomm
Snapdragon 800 processor under the hood
that's clocked at 2.26 7 gigahertz let's
see you have three gigs of ram 16 or 32
gigabytes of storage under under the
hood there and then also you can expand
that with a microSD card 3200 milliamp
hour battery and it's running Android
4.4 KitKat out of the box you also have
support for LTE and HSPA+ networks so
let's take a quick look at the software
here you can see your stamps install
you've got Q remote still which works
then with the IR blaster up top that's
next to the 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack on the bottom we've got a micro USB
port and of course nothing else like I
said the volume controls are on the back
there next to the single LED flash now
one thing i want to show you though was
the camera so let's let's see take some
pictures I was super rapid and so the g2
actually introduced some of the OIS
which was a great grey camera and now
I'm told that this is supposed to be
even better because what it does is it
combines the the shake when you shake
it's using both software and hardware to
make sure that your pictures come out as
clear and as shake free as possible you
can see it's easy to hold the 5.9 inch
screen doesn't seem too big I can't
really stretch across it but not so bad
and then most of the software features
are really similar to what you saw
before up top you've got all of your
controls you've got qslide q memo
everything like that but one thing
that's cool i'm going to try to do this
with one hand it's got this plug-in Play
feature now if you have headphones so
it's a sorry I'm leaning over here reply
in some headphones okay so we just
plugged in some headphones so you can
see it then has this plug and play
option where you can choose music videos
your phone what you want to use the
headphones with automatically so pretty
neat if you're specifically plugging in
headphones for a phone call or something
like that really nice and thin device
hopefully has the same kind of battery
life that we saw with the g2 or here we
have this widget open or the g pro for
that matter and the g flex which was
also pretty solid with battery life in
any case this is todd Hazleton with
TechnoBuffalo and i'm here at Mobile
World Congress checking out the g pro 2
from LG and stay tuned for a ton of
coverage you're gonna have a lot of
stuff going on to show</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
