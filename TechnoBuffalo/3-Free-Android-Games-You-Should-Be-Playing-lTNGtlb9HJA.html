to you by the all-new G flex 2 from LG
life's good hey what's going on guys the
Markman sanger from TechnoBuffalo and
today we'll be checking out three free
games on android we're playing right now
today we're going to be using the LG G
flex 2 which is packing the latest
Snapdragon 800 series processor from
Qualcomm and it has plenty of RAM to
handle the most amazing games starting
off with number one which is Shadowgun
deadzone now this one isn't particularly
new but it's a really fun game to play
nonetheless and the graphics are pretty
good for a mobile game there's no story
mode no practice mode or even a local
multiplayer mode everything happens
online in two game modes there's def
match every man for themselves and zone
control which is something along the
lines of capture the flag both game
modes accommodate up to you 12 players
and to be honest it doesn't feel all
that crowded and the gameplay is superb
especially on this 5.5 inch screen
there's the usual moving control on the
left hand side and the shoot run rollin
grenade buttons are on the right hand
side it will take some time getting used
to for the first few minutes but once
you get the hang of it it's really easy
to shoot other players when you kill
enemies you get to spend points to
upgrade your gun or unlock new guns
afterwards and this is a part that can
be pretty addicting the more you play
the more you want unlock weapons moving
on to number two which is plants vs
zombies 2 now i remember the first
plants vs zombies game came out on pc
and mac i bought it right away and got
really hooked the whole point of the
game is to stop the zombies from getting
to your base which is where your lawn
mowers are now to do this you will have
to plant various fighting plants which
you can do after collecting a certain
amount of sunshine each stage has
different waves of zombies attacking
from the less powerful ones that only
take a few heads to the others that have
armors and special abilities now what's
different about this version of pvz is
that you'll be traveling through time
with Krazy Dave you end up going to
ancient Egypt to the Wild West to the
future and more there's also new plants
and new power up systems to make your
plants stronger throughout the game
which is very helpful in my opinion
other than story mode there are a few
other challenges and minigames like the
pinata event that'll give you
idea of items after completing a series
of challenges planting new plans to earn
diamonds or coins to buy items and
plants and there's a ton more you can do
after you unlock stages overall the game
is very fun it'll make you think quickly
and gets addicting once you pass a few
stages and unlock new plants and last
but not least fault eight now asphalt 8
is probably the best arcade racing game
available for Android it's got real cars
like Ferraris Lambos Tesla yes they have
a tesla model s in a racing game which
is crazy the graphics are also really
good for a mobile game which I'm really
surprised the physics and elements
inside the games are definitely top
notch and very arkady which is not a bad
thing it actually makes the game really
fun you'll spend a lot of time jumping
off tracks or jumping off bridges and
doing air tricks which can be fun at
times if you time it right but pulling
off those tricks or drifts across the
track will earn you boost which is very
helpful if you want to pass your
opponents or knocked him down you can
also play online with other people and
surprisingly enough it works really well
at least at home in here at the office I
didn't notice any lags or any stutter
when I was playing it was pretty smooth
overall like I was playing a single
player game asphalt 8 is a game I like
to pick up every now and then after a
long day and when I want to relax it's
fun and unlocking new cars in upgrading
is definitely a good feeling and makes
me want to play even more and there you
guys have it these games are all free
from the google play store but of course
there's the usual in-app purchases in
all these games that we mentioned but
you don't really necessarily have to pay
for them unless you want thank you guys
