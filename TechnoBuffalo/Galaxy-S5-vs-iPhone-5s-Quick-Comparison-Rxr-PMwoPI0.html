TechnoBuffalo I'm here in Barcelona
Spain where Samsung just announced the
galaxy s5 here it is we've already
brought you a hands-on but I wanted to
bring you a quick comparison with the
iphone 5 because yes people want to know
and people are asking so we'll show you
of course size comparison obviously
there's a big size difference in the
displays but there's also a big focus
here that we want to pay attention to
because Samsung's putting a lot of
effort into creating a really good case
so it is important to compare the two
though because Samsung's putting a lot
of effort into creating a really good
camera it's got Auto HDR it's got it's
actually a 16 megapixel camera versus
the iphones 8 megapixel sensor so you
got a lot of changes and hopefully we
haven't really tested it yet but the
samsung is really going to step up the
game and go toe-to-toe with the 5s which
is one of the best cameras on the market
right now you can see the size
difference we've already gone over that
the port's covered here on the bottom
because it's ip67 resistant to water now
looking at the displays my iphone was
dying so it might be and also totally
grimy but you can just see the size
difference here obviously if you've used
the galaxy s4 or no 3 anything you know
there's a lot bigger there's big
difference in this play but one thing
that Samsung is really putting on and
I'm under some bright lights here is the
ability to adjust not only the
brightness but also the contrast ratio
of the display under direct sunlight so
that hopefully it's always bright and
that's a big pain point for am OLED
displays always they're usually kind of
pretty dim or reflective under bright
lights so hopefully that's a solution
here also while we're on the topic of
iphone comparisons you see a flatter
interface here much flatter as a matter
of fact so you've got the the simple
buttons as opposed to the squares that
we had before the settings menu here
circles it's it's almost kind of a
reminder I guess in some ways of iOS are
almost something that we'd see from
Nokia on the Asha
it reminds me do up in any case and also
sorry one last thing let's look at the
bottom here this is the fingerprint
reader and again i'm sorry it's so grimy
up and running around all day it's the
fingerprint reader on the iphone 5s now
you just put your finger there and it
unlocks or you can make a purchase on
the galaxy s5 it requires a swipe okay
in this case that was just to bring it
up the menu because i hit it but if it
requires a swipe and then you can make a
payment using paypal online get unlock
the device you can unlock a secret part
of the device that has pictures and
videos whatnot if you want to take a
picture of passport before you're
traveling and stuff like that in any
case just wanted to show you a quick
comparison between the galaxy s5 and the
iphone 5s this is todd Hazleton from
