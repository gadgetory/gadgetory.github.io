technobuffalo here with some Nintendo
news for you the folks at Nintendo just
wrapped their 3d as keynotes so I want
to give you a recap he's wrapped and now
give it a recap lots of caps about
everything that just happened and what
you can expect to get a 3 vs and you're
a hot little 3e love at hand stick
around so the keynote just ended facing
you look down its cuz I got notes in
front of me because there was a lot to
remember so let's go ahead and jump
right in first the 3ds it is glasses
free technology and glasses-free 3d
technology of course it's very similar
to what we saw actually LG exhibit at
CES it's similar technology to I used to
see on the old baseball card being move
on you something gotta swing is back you
have to be sitting right in the right
area and have a position just proper but
if you do it does look three-game you
don't need those silly looking glasses
same form factor pretty much as a DS
Lite a little bit more metallic so you
can tell a difference but if you've ever
held the d/s light it's going to feel
very very very similar ah so you can
play 3d games obviously awesome the
stylist that you're going to use to do
that it's actually still using a
resistive touchscreen on the bottom with
the plastic Silas is now metal so little
improvements I guess I also be able to
play back catalogue of DS games but that
will not be in 3d but if you're looking
to get a portable game console and
antennas what you want I pick up 3d a
standstill play all of your old DS games
kind of neat you can also take 3d
pictures with the camera on it which is
also a pretty novel thing for a video
game console to take 3d pictures of
course you can we view them back in 3d
on the Nintendo 3ds but hey it'll work
and you can show grandma a picture of
whatever although I'm sure it's going to
be used for super pervy things a 3d
camera but neither for everyone if you
buy it so it's going to
come in two colors at launch aqua blue
at obsidian black coaches code for shiny
fingerprint black really what they call
obsidian but you can pick up your two
colors and we'll talk about launch date
and all its up in just a minute to come
with a two gig SD card and standard SD
card size you can upgrade that to
whatever 32 or ever size you want to put
in there but it will ship with a 2
gigabyte card there's a new button
layout the home buttons different and
there's a little bit of a new user
interface flows you that have used a DX
in the past you're going to have a 3d
depth slider and that's sort of how this
new 3d technology works everybody's eyes
are a little bit different and are going
to respond look differently to the
screen so a 3d depth slider is going to
let you adjust the 3d technology just
for you however somebody's looking over
your shoulder watching the game might
just look super blurry and non 3d like
to them so let's talk about some of the
launch games there are going to be done
30 plus games at launch from first and
third-party titles and some old
favorites are coming back oh we're going
to have pilot wings we're going to have
a Nintendogs and cats but if you like
that stuff more thumbs up and less fart
noises we're going to have the legend of
zelda the ocarina of time 3d which is
super awesome i love the ocarina of time
when it came out on n64 so it's cool
it's going to be 3d version of that and
also making a comeback for those of you
folks much like me that are over twenty
eight ER in your 30s you're gonna
remember Kid Icarus well kid icarus is
making a comeback with a real cool new
aiming community system so he can shoot
his business it's called Kid Icarus
Uprising kind of neat oh you have a dead
in our live game you're gonna have
madden game Super Street Fighter forward
so you can get your street fighting on a
kind of neat you're going to be able to
have a new me making software so you can
make your own knee mi I not me like this
guy um similar to what you have on the
Nintendo Wii me maker in the week I'm
telling you these Nintendo keynotes
really are a tongue twister but that's
going to be there as well as also going
to a new and improved web browser so if
you
get your web browsing on the annual
screen you can do that too virtual
console is alive and well you can
download game boy or Game Boy Advance
titles if you want to get your old
school super mario brothers on and non
3d of course you can go ahead and do
that so about the biggest question how
much and when well that how much is to
49 99 and then they initially announced
it they said it was going to be between
three and four hundred and came in a
little bit lower 249 99 so just about
258 some oles clams duck get some
buckets of tickets I don't know what
else you can say for money but it's
gonna cost 250 dollars it's going to be
available in the US on March 27 however
if you are lucky enough to be in Japan
you'll be able to pick one up a full
month earlier on februari 27 so the
question is how do you feel about 3d
gaming I can see 3d gaming on a large
screen you know playstation 3 or Xbox
but it's such a small scale it's gonna
be kind interesting how it's going to
affect your eyes in the long term or
gonna be able to play for a while before
your eyes feel like they're going to
literally fall out of your head and roll
on the floor you're going to get
headache so then all kinds of weird
rumors or they're not it's going to be
super awesome sauce and going to see if
thumbs up for emphasis is really going
to redefine gaming it's sort of
staggering two worlds a 1 1 a is using
an old-school resistive touch freedom to
stylus especially in the days of Android
web OS and iOS and everything's
capacitive touchscreen meeting non Silas
it's going to be a little bit
interesting to sort of take a step
backwards I on the other hand super
high-tech with this new 3d technology so
kind of neat a Nintendo made a point to
say that you've never seen 3d technology
like this no matter what trade show I
would just clearly a knock at Sony who
had 3d technology everywhere all over
there their CES booth which we covered
on TechnoBuffalo in a giant ball field
size 3d screen was super cool so the big
question I'm digressing are you excited
about the 3ds will you pick up a 3d s
you care about the three BS how many
times can i say 3d s i want to hear from
you sound off in the comments down
lo that looks bad i'm jon rettinger from
technobuffalo and i'll see you guys in
the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
