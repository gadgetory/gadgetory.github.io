Hazleton from technobuffalo Samsung just
wrapped up its unpacked press conference
here in Barcelona at Mobile World
Congress where we saw a bunch of news
heard a bunch of news it was crazy we
had the galaxy s6 was finally announced
the galaxy s6 edge was announced that
still one with the panels that kind of
the glass panel on the front that bends
over the sides really cool looking
device we have hands-on with both on the
site and then just to recap some the
other stuff that happened the samsung
announced samsung pay which will work
with NFC as well as magnetic card
readers so you hold your phone your
magnetic terminal or use it similar to
what we've done with Google Wallet NFC
Apple pay to make your mobile payments
and then we also saw an update to gear
VR in the form of support for the new
galaxy s6 and the galaxy s6 edge the new
unit is lighter than the old model
that's available only for the galaxy
note 4 it's also I believe a bit thinner
and it also has a USB port so that you
can charge the device actually use it
longer than just simply relying on your
phone's battery which is the case with
the original one so we're looking for
that hopefully sometime this spring i'm
not sure Samsung didn't really
specifically say a release date and
pricing we don't know yet but the
original for the galaxy note 4 came in
at about one hundred ninety-nine dollars
so probably around the same price point
there in any case we have hands-on with
the new phones on the site so check it
out this is Todd Hazleton from
