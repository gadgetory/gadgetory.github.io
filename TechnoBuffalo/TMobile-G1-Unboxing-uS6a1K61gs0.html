Lakers khamir with an unboxing for you
of the t-mobile g1 this is a device you
might remember that I reviewed a while
back when it first came out but I didn't
have the phone for very long then and
I'm still receiving a lot of questions
on the phone itself so I haven't been
able to really answer those so the folks
at t-mobile were nice enough to send me
another one to review this one I get for
a little bit longer and actually get a
box so I have something to unbox for you
also there's been some firmware updates
that have been issued since I last used
the phone so hopefully it will address
some of the nitpicky issues that I had
with it last time so without further ado
let's go ahead and get to the unboxing
and I'm gonna use this one for a few
weeks and post another review and see if
anything that I thought before has
changed so let's open this bad boy up
all right we've got a note from the PR
firm with some g1 related press material
nothing terribly exciting and here is
the box itself t-mobile g1 you haven't
seen one of these boxes yet kind of cool
it's got a picture device on the front a
little bit of like a rainbow logo cutout
of the g1 right there just some SKU
information t-mobile on the side green
t-mobile right there and big old g1 on
the other side on the back list the key
features internet phone I am text email
3 megapixel camera and music so let's go
ahead and bust this thing open and see
what we got and it does look like this
is the black one so you slide this off
and there was that rainbow color that
was coming through here another picture
of the phone looks like this one's been
reviewed before
some more of that rainbow color with
pictures and myspace mobile and there is
it the device open so let's open this up
here so there's a phone itself it looks
like there's hang up top here with some
information let's see what that is
alright getting started guide she had
pretty big getting started guide I doubt
I will ever look at that t√©rminos equal
DC nose
there it is terms and conditions return
policy there was a Spanish side t-mobile
hotspot terms and conditions and
whatever this is tips and tricks
probably will never look at any of that
put that back up top actually will throw
it off to the side for right now so here
is the device itself this whole thing
right here actually looks to be like
white paper it's actually a foam to help
protect the device so I'll put this off
to the side for just a minute I will
keep digging into the box here well pull
up this big piece of foam inside we have
a charger which it is mini USB which is
nice so it's not proprietary means you
can use it with a lot of other chargers
got a USB to mini-usb cable it's like a
HTC headphone with a headphone adapter
they a 3.5 millimeter plug right there
so that was nice them the g1 doesn't
have a headphone jack so looks like you
have to have this adapter they put in
some foam covering for the earbuds and a
case let's take a look at the case here
it is a plastic case it's not leather
just a little sleeve right there I don't
know who would use this but if you fall
in that category of using salute cases
and you want to get a g1 know that it
comes with one all right let's put all
that stuff off the side and let's look
at the fun stuff here is the phone
itself three I mean from when I use the
last time I remember having a really
nice feel to it and it definitely does
so let's walk through the device here
just real quickly you've got a send
button a home button a trackball which
is actually the same trackball found on
most BlackBerry's back button and then
end button and a menu button on the all
that's right there there's a menu button
on the left side of device you've got a
volume up and down toggle and each TC
Brandon on the right hand side you've
got a dedicated camera button for the
three megapixel camera on the back that
does lack autofocus flash or a portrait
mirror and on the back it says by Google
it's got kind of that soft touch plastic
coating that makes it feel real nice in
the hand nothing on top nothing on
bottom except for the mini USB charging
port but the real fun of the device
actually is when you slide it open it's
got the kind of rainbow arc slide so it
goes out and then comes back in show you
guys that one more time tried it in slow
motion goes out comes back in sliding
really does have a very solid feel to it
and you are greeted with a full QWERTY
keyboard 1 2 3 4 5 rows with a full row
of dedicated numbers and your typical
QWERTY pad I remember the keyboard here
being real nice and easy to use so I'm
sure that is still the case then close
that up let's do a real quick size
comparison I think the biggest
competitor probably to the t-mobile g1
I'd have to assume is the iPhone through
the size comparison with the iPhone they
look relatively similar in size the
least close to the same footprint let's
put them on top of each other looks like
the g1 is just a little bit
thinner there and it's certainly thicker
due to the slide-out keyboard at the
iPhone and iPhone 3G both don't have so
there's the iPhone some other devices
that I still have hanging around here is
the Samsung I believe it's to behold
they all look relatively similar stack
this next to each other about the same
as the iPhones footprint actually this
is a little bit narrower and certainly
thinner here are the three next to each
other and I've got another slide out
phone that we can compare it with
slide-out QWERTY phone rather here is
the HTC fuse by 18t or on the AT&amp;amp;T
network with a slide-out keyboard as
well certainly much smaller it does have
a smaller screen though actually the
screen appears to be the same size let
me check that yeah the screen is the
same size on both these devices let's
check thickness the g1 is noticeably
thinner and this one has the a slide-out
keyboard as well so in case you're
wondering for size and how fit in your
pocket hopefully that'll answer your
question let's go ahead and turn this
thing on and see what the boot up looks
like looks like it's got a little bit of
a charge on it or at least enough to
turn on t-mobile g1 she has a screen
protector on it too that was nice and
them and it is a capacitive touchscreen
which is the same type of touchscreen
found on the iPhone meaning it you can't
use a stylus and it registers touched
through a transfer of electrons on your
finger let's see if this boot up here
looks like t-mobile g1 Android operating
system with a little glowing robot
Android guy I'm actually really looking
forward to using Android again welcome
to the g1 touch Android to begin okay
it's easy to set up your account let's
use a gmail account slide your finger up
and down you can do that go next next
don't have an account we can just enter
this I think go to the home screen no
I'm not let me get to the home screen
I'm gonna have to go through and do this
whole setup here but I won't drag you
guys through that so here's just a real
quick overview and unboxing of the
t-mobile g1 you'll see a green LED
indicator right there blinking to let
you know it's on it does look like this
has a full charge on it too so anyway
guys I'll use this for a little while
and do a full review this is a John
Rhett injure with the t-mobile g1 yet

you in the next video
