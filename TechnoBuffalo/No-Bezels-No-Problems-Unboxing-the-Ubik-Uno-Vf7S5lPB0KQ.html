here with TechnoBuffalo with another
unboxing for you and here we've got the
Ubik uno you might not have heard of
these guys before this is the kind of
notorious kickstarter-funded
device that is supposedly a no
compromises no strings attached as
you'll see here Android device made by
the people for the people the guys who
made this are really really experienced
in the industry and thought themselves
why make you wait two years before
getting a new device so let's see let's
see how they did this thing is really
interesting really excited to open this
thing up it's a kind of a really nice
nice packaging it feels like it's kind
of like recycled recycled cardboard or
something of that nature let's go ahead
and slide that right out set this let's
set that right there and of course we've
got a box now where is the open there it
is there's the flap cool there we go and
inside we've got of course we've got the
device pop that out so that's thick and
we've got a little package here that's
got inside of it a wall wart this is a
fast-charging wall wart which I'm
excited to play with because if I
remember correctly this cable lights up
here and it it lets you know when it's
fast charging and when it's not which is
really cool so this isn't just a
run-of-the-mill USB cable it is regular
old micro USB but it is not so it's not
type C but it's not just a regular old
USB cable so that's exciting usually
that's all we get let's set that off to
the side let's see if we've got anything
else in here no uh no usual Quick Start
Guide which is exciting we've got some
earbuds here these don't look terrible
either you look like halfway decent
earbuds - not bad
we've got a do we have an inline mic
yeah we've got an inline mic we've got a
switch here which are actually looks
like a volume slider and you've got a
call button here nice not too shabby at
all let's set this stuff aside while
this is booting I'm
going to talk about some specs really
quickly you'll see a stock Android look
right there and that's because this
thing is indeed running android 5.1
stock these guys have said that the only
thing they've done is modify the camera
just a little bit to take more advantage
of this really nice Sony sensor on the
back but everything else is stock
Android which is really really exciting
you can see these teeny tiny bezels on
the side so let's talk about what's
under the hood of this thing we've got
an octa-core 2.2 gigahertz processor and
that is a mediatek processor it's an MT
67 95 you might not have seen many
devices running mediatek processors
because Qualcomm is kind of the darling
at the moment but they said that they
had a lot of heat issues with the 810
the Snapdragon 810 and that they wanted
to go with something that was more
stable and more reliable for users and
they said that the media tech is since
it's a true octa-core they can run all
eight cores at 64 bits so I'm really
really excited to see if this processor
does pretty well that's a that's really
snappy already in addition to that
mediatek processor you've got three gigs
of ram under the hood which is a nice
healthy amount of RAM I keep feeling
like four gigs is too much for right now
but three sounds just about right and 16
gigs of on-board storage which is
expandable via microSD up to 64 gigs
around the back here we've got this
giant 20 megapixel camera which is the
Sony lens it's got six different pieces
of glass on the inside it can record all
the way up to 120 frames per second
they're really really proud of that and
you've got of course a dual tone flash
right here the feel the material on the
back is interesting it's got a little
makes a little kind of scratchy sound
like one of those little hologram fogs
that used to have back in the day that
battery is a 3100 milliamp hour battery
which is a nice hefty sized battery and
it's going to charge in three hours
according to Ubik and that's without
fast charging so with fast charging
it'll charge even faster the display
look at this thing I'm already really
excited by the display it's a nice crisp
bright display nice high contrast nice
vivid colors it's a 5.5 inch screen
across
HD display 1920 by 1080 that comes out
to a dpi of 400 flat and of course we've
got some gorilla glass here up on the
front and as I mentioned we're looking
at stock lollipop is it 5.1 5.1 how
exciting is that
plus for those of you who are kind of
paying attention to the budget market
right now might be notable this does
have NFC while we're here let's take a
quick visual tour around the hardware of
the device around the bottom you see
you've got your micro SD you've got a
mic right here around the right side
we've got a power button we've got two
buttons right here for the volume rocker
so it's technically not a rocker then I
would suppose up around the top we've
got a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack and
around the left side we've got two trays
here looks like we're looking at a sim
tray and a micro SD tray as well around
the back we've got that a little bit of
a camera hum which I'm not crazy about
but that's okay and a rear firing
speaker it might look like the entire
that goes across the whole way it does
not just right there and then of course
around the front you've got your speaker
up at the top your front-facing camera
and your beautiful display right here
just kind of bigger bezels around the
top and on the bottom to kind of make up
for the the lack of bezel around the
sides the device is a little thicker a
little thicker than I would have
expected but it's certainly not too
thick the lack of bezel here really does
kind of seem like it'll make it a lot
easier to reach those side drawer menus
and also help out with you know anything
that's have been that top left corner
there I've been running the zenfone 2
I'm about to take a look at the oneplus
2 and now the Ubik uno I'm really
excited to see how these budget devices
off I wouldn't even call these budget
devices these are value devices
off-contract this thing is going to be
running I believe it's going to be $340
for a device with these kinds of specs
it's just out of control
it's it's difficult to believe that it's
2015
that an independent company can just pop
up and make a phone it's really really
cool
so thank you guys so much for watching I
hope you enjoyed this quick look at the
yubico no really excited to put it
