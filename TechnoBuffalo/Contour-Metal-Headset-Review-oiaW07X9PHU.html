for you of the contour metal bluetooth
headset that i unbox for you a little
while ago so first let me give you a
quick tour of the device once again
close you that may not have seen the
embosser you go ahead and zoom in just a
little bit here go ahead to see my lips
moving while I talk about the headset
first you can see it really is razor
thin and it's just as light as it looks
thing weighs absolutely nothing it's
made a very lightweight aluminum or for
those of you that don't say aluminium
aluminium I always get guff for saying
that it's really just weighs nothing and
the only buttons and methods for it put
it on the front there are three buttons
there is a volume up and volume down and
a call end or send button which also
activates boyf styling if your phone
supports it it comes with a variety of
little earbuds and it sits in your ear
really nicely and easily and you hardly
even notice it again just because of the
weight you can compare it size wise to
the device I just reviewed the jawbone
you really can't see a really
significant size difference put them up
next to each other the contour metal is
probably half maybe even a quarter the
thickness of the jawbone certainly half
the weight so go ahead and zoom back out
as can see me talking to you since this
is a Bluetooth headset first and
foremost most important thing is called
quality and call quality on the contour
metal is fantastic on my end that
sounded nice crisp and clear and on the
receivers end they said the same thing
it's nice clear the curly tell i was on
a headset one issue that i did have with
the dough is when there's ambient
background ones this does not block out
any sort of noise whatsoever and i found
a knock on the head 6 that doesn't claim
to be a noise reducing headset but it is
a big issue it seems to pick up
background noise a little more than most
headset so just be wary of that if you
have a convertible if you're in windy
environments people are always talking
behind you and you're on the phone this
headset main
do the best ones to look at but if you
are in quiet environments this headset
is absolutely fantastic I'm is
definitely worth checking out another
cool thing about it is that charges just
via bluetooth a little adapter two plugs
in the bottom and it goes right into
your USB Drive so there's always a USB
port available for charging at least
most people have a computer or a laptop
just plug it in does make life nice and
easy battery life was fantastic I was
able to get almost close to four hours
of talk time and standby time that claim
is in the 20s so battery life I'm such a
small headset really is superb as well
get this device aside to meet courtesy
of the good folks at my gear store so if
you want to learn more about it i'll put
a link to the store up in the sidebar
and if you'd like to buy the device or
anything on their website they'll give
you ten percent off just for watching
john for lakers videos which is always
nice to them anyway guys jon rettinger
