TechnoBuffalo and in this video I'm
going to show you something really
awesome that just came out of Microsoft
labs it's called pivot and it allows you
to analyze massive amounts of data to
help you make decisions and right now
it's a free download i'll post a link on
TechnoBuffalo on how to get it just kind
of wanted to give you a demo of
different ways that you could use this
awesome new technology so here we start
with the collections which are
collections of data that Microsoft has
pre-populated the idea is that if lots
of people like this they're going to
come out with more collections though
create tools that will allow you to
import your own data so that you can use
this program so let's go down to dog
breeds I really like dogs and I want
some help in trying to find a dog that
is right for my lifestyle so i click on
dog breeds and then I immediately get
this really beautifully organized grid
that is organized by group of dog and up
here I can sort by different parameters
I can sort by approximate lifespan so I
can see right off the bat which dogs are
expected to live longer than others and
for me that's a good place to start so
I'm going to go down to two lifespan
down here on the left side and I'm going
to say that I only want to see dogs that
live longer than say fifteen years I
want the dog to be around for a while so
here we go these are the dogs that live
for more than 15 years now I also live
in a in an apartment so I want to make
sure that the dog doesn't have crazy
exercise needs that they won't get bored
and start eating the furniture if I
don't take them out for a run for an
hour a day so I'm going to check off
minimal and low for exercise needs and
now we are drilled down to a couple of
dogs but I also want a medium-sized dog
I don't want a little kick dog then I'm
going to trip over when I walk in at
night but I don't want a huge dog that's
going to you know intimidate people when
they come in so i am going to go into
sighs and I'm going to check off medium
and now I'm drilled down to just three
dogs that fit all of my criteria and I
can zoom in with my mouse I can move it
up and down kind of like
you know you're browsing on an iPhone
and all of these look pretty ugly except
for this one I like that dog you can
click on it it tells you what the name
of the dog is some information about it
you get some web links for more
information and that sort of thing so
that's one example of how you can use
pivot to help you find a dog that is
right for you let's go to discover more
collections and this time let's go to
concept cars I really like cars and I'm
always curious to see of the cool
concepts that come out so right off the
bat we get this visual display that
shows us the different sort of body
styles but of course you can filter it
by different parameters let's see I want
to see kind of the more recent
turbocharged cars concept cars so I'm
going to go to production here and I'm
going to filter this out by just in the
last 15 years or so so pivots going to
regenerate and now we have a smaller
list of choices I'm going to go down to
aspiration I just want to see the
turbocharged concept cars i really like
turbocharged cars i like the sound that
the turbo makes when it spools up and
let's see what else i want to change
body style I want to I want to see all
the coops and here we go here are all
the coop so we can go through and these
are all the turbocharged coops concept
cars that have come out in the last few
years and we can kind of move around on
the screen very intuitively and
elegantly just a really awesome way to
sort of look at data and be able to find
quickly information that you want let's
do one more I'm going to go back to
discover more collections and this time
I'm going to go to xbox marketplace I
haven't been to this one yet so I'm
curious to see what it looks like so
while this shows all the games that are
available on the xbox marketplace we can
sort by genre I want to go to release
date I want to see sort of the older
games that came out let's say in 2006 so
we can drill into any of these columns
go to 2006 and we can also use the zoom
tool up here to kind of move back or you
can use the zoom tool on your mouse and
we see all of the Xbox titles here that
came out in this year now I want to see
only the racing games and flying games
that came out in all of these years here
they are and let's look at price I want
to see sort of the
the most expensive the hottest games
that came out here they are and also I
want to see game ratings games that
really are made for for everyone so I'm
going to check off efore everyone and
then we're left with just a few titles
that allows me to really drill down and
see the games that I want to see that
are for everyone that came out in the
last few years that have to do with
racing or flying this makes it really
easy and intuitive to look up that
information so again guys just a quick
look at Microsoft pivot I think it's
going to be an awesome thing in the
future especially if it gets a lot of
traction really helps you analyze a lot
of data quite easily in a very visually
pleasing way that makes it easily
digestible so again we'll post a link on
TechnoBuffalo on how to get this and
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
