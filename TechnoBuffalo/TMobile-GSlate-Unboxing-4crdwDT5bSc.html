TechnoBuffalo calm and this is the G
slate there's so many terrible jokes
that a suburban kid like me who's not a
kid anymore could make about G what up g
g money yeah now they're just they're
feeling already it's the Chiefs late
it's a it's one of the two new g devices
coming out from t-mobile the other one
expected to be the tmobile g2x are not
expected that they're having a party for
the g2x also LG these RT mobilized
versions of devices that we saw launched
from LG by LG rather at Mobile World
Congress at Barcelona back in February
but here it is the t-mobile USA version
the G slate it's an android 30 honeycomb
tablet 8.9 inch display it will be
available starting april twentieth 5 29
99 after a hundred dollar rebate with
and i'm reading this directly from the
tmobile thing here with qualifying
mobile broadband plan on a two-year
agreement voice line and enrollment in
EZPay there's a lot of little things
after the width there but five 2999 is
the on contract after rebate price in
the box here's the slate when I out when
I use this at Mobile World Congress I
actually really like the form factor the
the 3d stuff hey what's up everybody the
3d stuff you know I'm not so sure about
interested to try it out again now with
you know a little more time play with it
but I really enjoyed the the form factor
I think it's it's you know being a
little bit smaller than something like
the the zoom and the galaxy tab 10 one
little easier to hold one handed and
then I also like the the widescreen form
factor I think it makes it easier for
reading things one headed this way and
then it's it's suited to you know HD
viewing this way as compared to
something like the iPad which does not
have a widescreen form factor anyway
this is not a kickstand it's just a
shiny thing this is with google well
this is booting up here also in the box
product war I information and warranty
guide underneath here you get the 3d
glasses awesome how awesome is it now
that gadgets come with glasses you get
the power adapter interesting not a USB
based it's a I guess needs more power
than USB can handle so it's a
proprietary adapter you get a microUSB
to USB adapter and a USB to micro USB
data cable interesting that you get this
to revisit cable ah the device itself
like I said 8.9 inch display 1280 by 768
so it's capable of showing the 720p
video right here on the unit will go
through this little startup thing I'll
set that up later run stock Android 30
it's thin it's lightweight one point
three pounds a little bit less than half
an inch thick it supports t mobile's 4g
network as well as their 3g network you
can see I've got 4g coverage here
starting to kick in you can see the
accelerometer going as I flipped the
thing around you've got a front facing
camera sorry you get a front facing
camera 2-megapixel front-facing camera
want to make sure I got the specs right
there 2-megapixel front-facing camera
and then the back the dual 5 megapixel
camera set up for 3d recording the
stereoscopic set up 5 megapixels it'll
shoot 1080p video capture it will also
shoot 720p 3d video so 1080p for just a
straight video 720p if you want to do
the 3d video capture and there's also a
flash LED flash you've got the mini USB
port on the bottom there you've also got
an H
GMI port on the bottom as well it'll do
hdmi out up to 1080p the display is 3d
capable with the glasses so you can
watch the 3d on here with the glasses
you can also send your video out and
either 2d or 3d to watch it on a
separate display these things just crazy
and crazier all the time three nine
millimeter headphone jack there's your
power switch rocker switch up on top
you've got your stereo speakers 32 gigs
of internal memory it's powered by an
NVIDIA Tegra 2 processor so there you go
to get this thing back on here and so
there's some proprietary apps that come
with us from t-mobile exclusive things t
mobile TV comes pre-installed needs for
need for speed shift HD is not a
proprietary t-mobile thing with that
also comes pre-installed Zinio reader
comes pre-installed and then you get the
google stuff as well and the special 3d
camcorder apps so you know I'm going to
try to keep this to a unboxing length
and dive into a full review later on
we'll just do a little bit of the the 3d
camcorder actions you can see what
happens so if I record myself well
enough let's record the glasses here and
you can see actually you don't have to
run the you know after record you can
see it it shows you the stereoscopic
stereoscopic image so you've got the red
and blue thing happening then you have
to wear the glasses I don't know how
well that's translating but through me
recording it but looking on the screen
here on the 3d camcorder mode you know
you can tell that it's doing a 3d image
if I had glasses on right now I do have
I have extra glasses suddenly I have all
these 3d glasses it used to be that
being a gadget review I had a lot of
memory cards and cables which I still do
but now I'm collecting 3d glasses which
is kind of nuts so I have to shoot some
3d video on this and see if we can get
it up to youtube and then that way
people you can watch it yourself with 3d
glasses at your place it's going to be
required now we're gonna have to make
TechnoBuffalo branded 3d glasses and
send them out to people
let's do a real quick here before we go
let's fire up t mobile TV cords gotta
check for updates you can see I'm
wearing my 2d glasses these don't let me
see in 3d but they let me see so yeah
you take what you can get sometimes but
I like the form factor so far I'll hold
it flat so there's not so much
reflection on it it's again you know
lighter lighter than an iPad and an
easier to hold one hand that I think
because the form factor and then also
i'm a new user ok i would have to do
this later because i'm not to find out
from them how they want me to I don't
know maybe it'll connect on Mecca and
then smaller than you know like i said
something with the yeah chem enough to
this later smaller than something like
the 10-inch tablets which I you know
it's different strokes for different
folks just like with smartphones there
you know three inch screens three and a
half four or 4.3 you know you've got the
different sizes on the the tablets as
well so hopefully that'll be a good
thing for the marketplace what I wanted
to do alright we will have much much
more on the G slate including a full
review including some 3d 3d footage
uploaded to the interwebs there if we
can figure out how to do it very soon in
fact by the time you see this there
might already be at least one other
video video for you to check out I'm
just saying sometimes in the tech world
they send your products there's an
embargo date and you can't publish
anything before the embargo date but you
can get stuff ready to publish so there
might just be another video already
ready for you to watch there you go I'm
Noah the website is techno Buffalo like
us on Facebook thanks to tmobile for
lending us the G slate to review we'll
see you later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
