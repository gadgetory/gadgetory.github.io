iPhone 10 just don't call it the iPhone
X the true successor to the iPhone is
here and there's a lot of technology
packed into its 5.8 inch OLED package
also getting announced today was the
iPhone 8 and the iPhone 8 plus so
support went out for it would have been
the iPhone 7s and the iPhone 7s plus the
leaks alright the phones look like we
expected them to look it looked like
this available in space grey or silver
but there's a lot of Technology perhaps
we didn't know about first the screen
technology it's OLED and Apple said they
waited on OLED for sort of obvious OLED
reasons it wasn't the best in direct
sunlight wasn't the best for brightness
they said they fixed all of those issues
creating a really bright and vibrant
display and they are dubbing this new
display super Retina display and I think
most exciting and probably most
importantly we finally have a true
higher resolution display from Apple
this thing has a resolution of 24 36 by
1125 you can do the math it's got a 458
PPI now it's by no means the highest
pixel per inch of any 5.8 inch phone out
there but it is the highest PPI that a
flows ever announced and they claim the
screen looks absolutely beautiful at
least it appears to look really nice and
it's got the same design that we
expected it is edge to edge with the cut
it on the top for the cameras we're
gonna talk a lot about those cameras
Apple is calling that whole cut out the
true depth sensors that they do a lot
with the phone but the cutouts on the
left and the right are gonna do a few
things so first one on the left is where
you're going to see your time on the
right you'll see notifications like
yours so it's a little strength you'll
see well then it connects to Wi-Fi we're
also gonna use those for the UI as well
our initial thought was that those areas
are going to be kept for only those
notifications but actually that area the
screen is gonna be used in a lot of apps
so if you're viewing a video there's
gonna be a cut out your video picture is
the same way they're party apps as well
so we're on the home screen only we see
those notifications up at the top so
bear that in mind no matter what you're
doing already have a little bit of a
cutout doesn't look to be a giant issue
with the phone but the cutout is
definitely going to be there this is
something I've been screaming at for
years and we finally have it from Apple
we now have wire
charging and a give Apple credit for
using the cheese standard so any cheat
chargers but not you've got a wireless
charger from Samsung or LG or Belkin or
Mophie whatever you want you can now
charge your iPhone 10 and also be able
to charge your iPhone 8 and iPhone 8
plus but of course it wouldn't be a flop
out sort of their own spin on it
so they're down something new called air
power the new technology it's gonna go
in conjunction with a new piece of
hardware that can charge multiple eye
things at once you can charge your
iPhone you could put your air pause on
it and your alpha watch series 3 which
got an ounce on it no kind of charged
all at once with a cool animations on
the phone that's not gonna ship till
next year but you got to know at least
it's qi wireless charging is here
powering this whole phone is Apple's new
a 11 Bionic chip in Apple's first
in-house design to GPU should get 70%
better performance and last gen that's
the same chipset that's gonna be found
on the iPhone 8 and the iPhone 8 plus
there's new sort of neural networking
processing being done because thing
doesn't have a home button and with that
o button don't have touch ID so enter
face ID this is fictional locking this
isn't like the old-school Android facial
lock and we sort of looked at your face
and unlocked apples doing crazy stuff
with the cameras here Apple's using
infrared and dot projection to actually
make a map of your face and isn't that
reference when you want to unlock your
phone so the way it works you'll pick up
the phone pull up to your face and it
will presumably unlock now the demo the
cred Federici did didn't work the first
time didn't appear to be overly fast
either perhaps that was just Ritter's or
purely software but I'm hoping it's
going to be fast cuz a success of the
iPhone 10 is gonna rely on face ID if
you want to unlock your phone as I'm
just looking at it you can now type up
from the bottom in fact that's where
you're going to get home any of your
apps it's just a swipe up from the
bottom multitasking is kind of similar
you swipe up from the bottom and then
yeah sort of wait a minute and then
multitasking will show up and you can go
wherever you want to go and you can use
the bottom to swipe between apps you can
go swipe to the left to get different
apps or swipe to the right to go back if
you want to launch control center you go
ahead and just swipe down from the upper
right and that's where control center is
going to live it's a new way to interact
with your iPhone Apple talking a lot
about a new experience with the phone
how the user is going to interact and
it's all
nerd around that camera system centered
a lot around face ID so the cameras on
the iPhone 10 won from this way to that
way but in that transition they gain do
optical image stabilization the
apertures changed a little bit
they got support for of course the
portrait mode of the new lighting
portrait effects which will work in real
time or after the fact and the
front-facing camera now supports both of
those portrait things as well so you can
take beautiful bouquet selfies or do
studio lighting with your portraits and
pricing we knew this wasn't going to be
cheap it's gonna come in two
configurations it's the same as the
iPhone 8 NE 8 + 256 or 64 gigs you're
going to be starting at 999 dollars
you'll be able to place your pre-order
on October 27th and it's going to ship
on November 3rd so in time for the
holidays but after the iPhone 8 and the
iPhone 8 plus solving this question to
you what do you guys think about the
iPhone 10 this is clearly the best that
Apple has to offer it's a competitive
phone with a compelling feature set to
compete against the best of Android but
isn't enough to make you stick with
Apple are gonna go for the lower price
iPhone 8 or iPhone 8 plus I really want
to hear your thoughts on this one I'm
excited for the iPhone 10 I want to try
face ID I want to see how it works and
if it works as promised and might lure
me back to Apple I can't wait to get my
hands on it gotta wait a few more months
to do so give the video a thumbs up if
you appreciate it for subscription
always helps as well til next time
