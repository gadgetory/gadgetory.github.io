technobuffalo here with an unboxing of
apples I guess new product line
rechargeable batteries the Apple Magic
Device is Magic Trackpad magic mice and
a wireless keyboard are notorious for
just absorbing crazy amount of juice so
those near that use those devices or
just a geek in general have a lot of
things that you double a batteries
probably cycle through them quite a bit
these are supposedly some of the best
rechargeable double a batteries on the
market so let's take a look so they're
going to set you back about 30 bucks i
believe they come with either four or
six batteries inside we will see capable
of being charged and hoping to charge
for up to 10 years so these things
should last quite a long time these
folks you have a very low vampire draw
what that means we charge batteries
fooling your put them in a drawer
somewhere or not using them slowly that
charge going to trickle out this pose it
will hold a charge for much longer when
the batteries you're not in use and I've
already been charged up and again gonna
cost you about 30 bucks let's go ahead
and again Apple battery charger we'll go
ahead and use the ubach here to cut this
knots lays a finger I'm a lot of
practice of my cutting so hopefully we
won't have a bloody show all right looks
like got that open go ahead and dig and
actually have not seen these in person
yet go ahead and open him up traditional
Apple packaging assume it says designed
by Apple in California somewhere on here
we got some more plastic go ahead and
slice into that yet again and what you
guys know how these work if they hold
the charge as well as traditional double
A's or if they're not as good or what
the general deal with them is so they're
to come in there here are two more it
looks like they actually come with a six
rechargeable batteries so 30 bucks for
six and the Chargers actually not the
worst deal in the world they do say are
rechargeable batteries on let's go ahead
and take these two out and we'll see if
they look like so go ahead and pull off
the plastic packaging and it looks very
similar to a traditional apple charger
and if there's you that truck travel
quite a bit you know that Apple Chargers
have a bit of a surprise if you go ahead
and pull out
off you go ahead and pop in
international charge in here this one of
course for the US which to live
elsewhere you're traveling elsewhere go
ahead and buy these tips you can get a
whole kit of them for about 30 books as
well and charge your batteries anywhere
in the world can see if the batteries
look like so rechargeable and that's
about it really no Apple branding on
there it says nineteen hundred million
power batteries I believe these are
allegedly made by sanyo some of the best
rechargeables around so go ahead and put
those in it shows you how they go in and
there is a indicator light on the top I
really isn't any literature that goes
with the is this pretty self-explanatory
plug in and use so want to give you guys
a quick look at them and again I'll let
you know how efficient or good they are
i'm jon rettinger from TechnoBuffalo and
i'll see you in the next video bye bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
