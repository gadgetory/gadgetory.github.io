of the Airport Extreme Base Station if
you want to know what it looks like
check out the unboxing reason I'm not
holding it here is because it's taking
care of my network right now so I've
been using the thing for a couple weeks
enough time to I think really get to
know it know it's capable of and what it
can do I gotta say the thing is great
hands down better than the Linksys
Wireless G router that I was using the
typical blue one this one here you know
that everybody has seen around it's the
go-to a router first start with the
negatives about the airport really the
only negative about it is it only has
three Gigabit Ethernet ports in the back
it's okay not a big deal actually I only
have three things that I want to plug
into it anyway so so that's okay
that's the only negative the cool things
about it now and you go back look at the
unboxing videos on the back it has a USB
port and what that USB port allows you
to do is network hard drives printers
anything that plugs into a USB port you
can really network up which is very
handy and you can also use a USB hub to
plug in and plug it in network ton of
drives it's actually very easy to do as
well if you're trying to networks an
external hard drive which i think is
probably the most common take your hard
drive plug it in you go to your system
utilities and it just shows up seeming
like a palabra ties as it just works on
the Airport Extreme Base Station really
just works setting it up took three
minutes again same thing I plugged it in
follow the instructions in my
Applications folder and went to airport
utilities and follows four steps named
by network set a password and boom it
was done so very easy there one thing to
know now anybody who has a wireless and
equipped computer whether it's a new
MacBook Pro I think even the Mac books
are wireless and the new iMacs any
that's over any PC or something that's
Wireless and capable the computer to
computer time for file transfer is
really fast it used to take me it say I
wanted to transfer a hour
on TV episode 2 on my Apple TV with my
old wireless G router from the MacBook
Pro to the Apple TV would take probably
six seven maybe ten minutes at least
amount of time to transfer things now
with the airport extreme from my
computer to the Apple TV it's done in
two minutes
I mean it's easily easily three times as
fast my download speeds have increased
also my bandwidth has stayed the same so
I think it's just just faster and
everything seems to just be running a
little bit zippy or whether it's my mind
or not you know is yet to be seen but
it's highly recommended
it hasn't disconnected and hasn't
crashed like the Linksys I'd have to
reset that thing every day the airport
just been really solid and it looks good
as well it doesn't have the big antenna
sticking up either which is very handy
it does get a little bit warm though
like echo fish mentions so you know be
worried of that but it's nothing
terribly bad at all just a little bit of
heat coming out the top alright guys so
let's pretty much a review of the
airport extreme on a scale of one to ten
I easily give it a a nine and a half out
of ten definitely definitely definitely
recommend it if you need one and you can
pick it up from the Apple store pick it
up online I think in the United States
best buyers are carrying them now I can
really get them anywhere and they will
work with a PC as well so no problem
there and it comes with software and
stuff - I can figure it all right guys I
know I hope you enjoyed the video any
questions let me know thanks for
watching thanks for subscribing and
that's it guys talk to you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
