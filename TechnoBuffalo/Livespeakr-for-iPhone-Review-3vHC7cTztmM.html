I've got a review for you of the live
speaker it is a portable speaker system
for your ipod iphone ipod classic really
anything apple with an i this speaker
system is meant for you i should note
though that it just uses a 3.5
millimeter headset jack to connect your
device so it will work with really any
sort of portable media player so what
this consists of our two relatively
substantial speakers on the side a dock
with your phone or ipod slide right in
and out of you can see mine is just
pushed right into it right now hold it
in nice and securely and you've got some
grips on the bottom so you can leave it
on the table it is a very simple and
minimalist design you've got a mini USB
charging port on the top and a power on
and off and volume is controlled via d
controls on your on my case iphone so if
you had an ipod be controlled via those
so the portable speaker system is
actually a very crowded one but things
that are this small this time you
generally don't have that good audio
fidelity basis doesn't sound good think
sound tinny i will tell you though that
the lives be here actually sounds very
good it sounded native it sounded much
better than send your computer speakers
even and for bringing us with you to the
beach or in summers coming up a barbecue
or pool party it really is actually a
pretty nice option they'll running you
$85 i'll put a link in the sidebar if
you're interested let me give you guys a
audio demonstration what this sounds
like although i'm sure some of the audio
fidelity and the quality is going to be
lost via youtube so i'll take the
headset jack and i'll plug it in turns
on and to avoid any serious copyright
issues here i'm just going to play a
sample from the itunes store so i've got
green day's on my favorite band so i got
green day cute up here from the new
album 21st century breakdown and we'll
play preview of know your enemy I'll
turn the volume up here so you guys can
hear it queuing up
turn volume down in town Stefan you guys
just going to apply that nice and short
but you can hear that the audio quality
is very good when it goes allowed it's
not the deafening tinny tone that you
get with a lot of portable speakers I'm
actually very impressed with this not
taking it with me actually the friends
house is to play some music really just
a nice option when you don't have a big
stereo system with you so if I had to
rate this on a one to five star skill
you know definitely give it a really
solid for only missing out you know
simply because of battery life actually
battery life is not the strongest on
this divide us but you'll get a couple
hours out of it it's going to be plenty
and since it uses micro USB you can just
charge it on the go I do like that
doesn't rely on double A batteries or
some sort of removable battery it's nice
to be able just to charge it and take it
with you on so guys hope you enjoyed
again I'll put a link in the sidebar for
interested in purchasing the live
speaker for exclusive content be sure to
follow me on twitter twitter com watch
John for lakers I'll see in the next
video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
