for you this time it is the Apple iPhone
Bluetooth headset this is the official
one that Apple put out my headset
previously was a Motorola H 700 I
believe and thing just died wouldn't
work with the iPhone it wouldn't work
with any phone just kind of killed
itself so I figured it's time for a new
one why not give Apple a shot
so enjoy the unboxing I'm gonna use it
for a day maybe two and I'll post a full
review for you guys
on it thank you all for subscribing and
thank you for watching and on a quick
side note if you want some tutorials
there's a guy on YouTube his name is
notion to notion than the number two
does some great Mac tutorials definitely
worth checking out so anyway guys enjoy
the unboxing and let me know any
questions that you might have and I will
try my best to answer them in the review
guys talk to you soon bye hey guys let's
get to it
here we've got the iPhone Bluetooth
headset box looks very familiar in size
to the iPhone box itself in fact the
dimensions are almost almost identical
so on the front of it in black it's got
a little picture of the headset Apple
logo says on the side iPhone bluetooth
headset on the other side I pull the
Bluetooth headset and on the box says
includes iPhone bluetooth headset dual
dock and Bluetooth travel cable
compatible with the iPhone supports
Bluetooth hands-free profile 1.5 alright
let's open it up
all right take off the back take off the
plastic I'm betting it says designed by
Apple in California somewhere in here
opens up just like the iPhone boxed it
from the top I'm still pushing me in the
on top there you go got some hard
plastic like the iPhone there is the
headset so it is extremely small very
small very tiny I mean it's amazing
actually cut time this thing is I'll
show you guys in a second some
comparisons of the sides let's finish
the unboxing put it here pull up pull
the plastic documentation in here and
the rest of the box here is the dual
dock it's very similar to the dock they
came with the iPhone yeah iPhone goes
here and the headset charges right there
so they charge on the same dock I'll
show you guys a little bit more when I
do the review and a charging cable to
plug into the dock just like the count
the iPhone except I'm like doing I came
with the iPhone it's got a port right
here to actually plug the headset right
into the charge for travel wherever you
are kind of cool so that's the box guys
that headset comes in let me show you
briefly some size comparison so you can
see how small the heads that actually is
here's the front rail remote
well here's a business card you can
really see how small the time spent that
that is it's tiny
here it is next to the iPhone here you
guys you see the size of the iPhone I
mean it's nothing very small all right
guys there's the unboxing I'll use it
like I said for for a day or two days
enough to get a sense of how it works
and I'll post a review for you thanks

I hope you guys enjoyed the latest
unboxing bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
