unboxing but I I need your advice so if
you guys have been following my iphone
thing you know I really love it but I've
become a little frustrated with some of
the features like the lack of a keyboard
and functional email so I have an offer
that somebody proposed to me they will
give me a brand new still in the package
sealed 16 gigabyte ipod touch for my
iphone in addition they'll also by my
apple bluetooth headset for a hundred
bucks so that means i could take that
hundred bucks and buy a motorola q or an
18 detail to both of which have
keyboards and gps and the whole thing
would only cost me a hundred bucks and
that have an ipod touch or i could sell
that ipod touch make a profit on the
deal so I know this is a little silly
dilemma but thought you guys can help me
out here I don't know what to do I love
the email I love the mobile safari on
the iphone I love being a look at
pictures on there it's it's such a fun
feature be able to scroll through the
pictures so I don't know did you guys I
have to let the guy know by tomorrow
early morning so I'll keep this video up
until then so you guys can give me some
advice and your thoughts I would really
appreciate it so just make sure I was
clear here some guys going to give me a
brand new still in the box 16 gig ipod
touch for my iphone and he will also buy
my bluetooth headset four hundred
dollars so i have another bluetooth
headset also an old one um be happy to
use so that's the dilemma guys give me a
thoughts and advice i'm gonna go for a
little run on the back in an hour
hopefully you guys will have some good
feedback for me anyway thanks guys talk
to you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
