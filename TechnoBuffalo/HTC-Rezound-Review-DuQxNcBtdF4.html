technobuffalo here with a full review
for you of one of the latest flagship
phones and verizon's ever-growing
Android lineup this is the HTC built
resound and for all intensive purposes
it's the spiritual successor to the not
so old HTC Thunderbolt let's go ahead
and dig in and see if this guy's worthy
of resounding reviews and bad pun
alright so Before we jump into the full
review let me talk about the specs of
this guy and there's a lot of specs in
here to talk about alright so let's hour
'the price right now from the carrier
it's two hundred and forty nine dollars
although perhaps by the time you're
watching this review we're going to the
holiday season that price is going to
fluctuate so you're going to want to
check on that it's running android 2.3
point for with HTC sense 3.5 sitting on
top of it we'll talk about all this
stuff more in the review from a
dimension standpoint it's 5.08 inches by
2.5 inches by kind of chunky point five
four inches the display though is where
most of the action happens that's what
you're looking at right now this guy is
a 4.3 inch which we've seen many times
before s LCD panel with the resolution
of wait for it 1280 by 720 that's right
this is a 720p display for those of you
that can view quick math or have a
calculator watch handy that's 342 ppi
which is absolutely insane we're going
to spend a lot of time talking about
this display in the review what's going
to keep this display up and illuminated
is a 1600 20 milliamp hour battery all
being powered by a Qualcomm built
dual-core 1.5 meter chip it's got a gig
of ram 16 gigs of internal storage
expandable of micro SD on the back side
dual LED flash with a camera that can
shoot 1080p video it's got a 2 megapixel
shooter on the front verizon LTE which
will definitely talk about as we go
through the full review bluetooth 3.0
and bam beats audio alright so now we
ran through the really ample specs of
this device let's go ahead and talk
about call quality if it's not going to
make good phone calls it's not going to
be overly useful to you like most
verizon phones i've reviewed recently a
call quality was relatively good on this
guy i did have about three dropped calls
in notorious verizon dead zones where I
am in Southern California
during about a twenty call test my
testing period with the resound was
probably on the shorter side around the
15 call test so whether that typical or
atypical is going to depend on where
you're located but when the calls were
there and not dropped their crystal
clear i had no popping noise and have
any white noise and oftentimes a caller
thought that I was on a landline by the
callers I mean I mostly just called my
wife to see how I sounded we were are as
I was driving through certain areas I
did have a bit of an issue though
pairing it with certain Bluetooth
devices a job or in particular I dropped
the pairing toys before it finally held
on to it alright so now as promised
let's talk about this guy this display
is worthy of several minutes of a review
so it's 4.3 inches 1280 by 720 342 PPI
when you compare that to what was
considered one of the best displays in
the business 2 retina display that's
just over 320 PPI on the iPhone 4 and
the 4s so you can really appreciate the
amount of pixels that this guy packs in
and it packs a tremendous amount and it
does it without being a pentile display
uses a standard RGB matrix so what's
that gonna mean for you not all that
much but images and videos are going to
look outstanding you're not going to
have any pixilation at all with the
naked eye but don't take my word for it
let me go ahead and show you so we'll
jump ahead into gallery I've got some
images here queued up go ahead and move
it over I believe that is the by skyline
and it is just absolutely gorgeous here
no pixilation at all on images things
really really really pop the only thing
that's going to make the viewing
experience not so pleasurable is the
fingerprint magnet display I know a lot
of devices are oleophobic or can sort of
get some of the grease not to show
somehow this one it all tends to sort of
pool the gross were to say but it
definitely shows the grease there via
pictures the New York skyline or at
least in new york city streets
absolutely beautiful let me go to show
you some video because that's really
where the 720p display shines are one of
them anyways 720
p really shines so i'll go ahead and
jump into video go ahead and pick this
guy get here some of the audio coming
through it as well and it's going to be
tough to appreciate the video coming
from the phone to the camera to youtube
no matter what resolution are watching
it on but take my word for it it is
absolutely gorgeous watching videos on
here is a pleasure as you'd expect from
a screen with this incredible resolution
you can see it evenings by looking at
the home screen let's go and take a look
at some text and probably can be doing a
lot on this phone as looking at websites
or reading so let's go ahead and look at
netflix shares dropping so Ron
TechnoBuffalo calm and right off the bat
because the high resolution you might
notice that the text is a little bit on
the small side it's so crisp that the
text becomes a little bit smaller it's
the naked eye and because of that higher
resolution so I found myself at least
having to do a little bit of zoom action
to read now this is really going to
depend on your eyesight if you have
tremendous eyes and you're not going to
have any trouble reading the smaller
text you are going to love this phone if
you got slowly fading crappy eyes like
me you're going to find yourself again
doing a lot of zooming may be wishing
for a little bit of a lower resolution
so the text would appear a bit bigger I
know I sound like my grandfather when I
say which text is going to be bigger but
oftentimes that was true but as you zoom
all the way in you don't see any sort of
pixilation at all the text here is
absolutely beautiful it's probably the
best display that I've ever seen you
don't have any sort of blue tint that
you get with some mo LED panels it's
just absolutely gorgeous this is the
phone you have to look at in the store
to appreciate so I'll go ahead and jump
back the next thing that I wanted to
talk about is speed how fast is this guy
uh well the answer is pretty fast I
didn't have any memory issues at all
those running through using applications
on first or second generation android
devices often times you had to install
memory killers or memory management
applications to control how much memory
were using not so the case with the
modern
advises androids done a really nice job
and of course we're running gingerbread
2.3 point for here managing memory you
have built-in memory management if you
use it but scrolling through
applications you're not going to have
any sort of issue at all from a quadrant
score which is what I generally use to
gauge my phones I didn't put a blazing
numbers this is a stock rom put up a
score of 2269 and this is probably what
those instances to where you can see how
high the pixel resolution is I had a
squint all the way into read that number
really very tiny but that was the score
again 2269 speed on this guy and one of
the best things about it is verizon's
LTE network and again it's going to vary
depending where you are but I was
pulling in blazing numbers so I'm going
to go ahead and make sure Wi-Fi is
connected you can see one of the sense
3.5 settings so Wi-Fi is turned off I
want to run a speedtest live on camera I
don't generally do this but i want to
show you how fast these speeds are you
can see some my previous results they're
absolutely blazing and I'd wager bet
this is faster than most home networks
getting now in the in the tens I was
getting the 13s down pretty regularly
and I was getting about five up which
we're seeing right here is absolutely
incredible speeds odd to get from my
mobile network so my hats off to verizon
again this again depends on where you
are and whether or not you get LTE I'm
in Southern California but those speeds
are incredible so on this test I got 11
down and about 4 up and oftentimes my
speeds were even faster than that LTE
definitely gets two giant thumbs up if
you're looking to get a verizon phone
right now for sure only get one that
offers LTE but what's going to make all
this data speed show you stuff and
that's the software this is running HTC
sense 3.5 while run in and show you that
it's actually the second phone to run
HTC sense 3.5 HTC Rhyme being the
previous one so sense 3.5 android 2.3
8.4 you can see all kinds of other
software there there's not that much to
report and sense 3.5 it gets some
niceties you get slow motion video
capture you can remove home screens but
the rest of the stuff is all pretty
standard HTC sense that we've seen in
the past including one of my favorite
features it actually made its way to the
official build of ice cream sandwich
with this does not have this is the
ability sort of drag application so ice
cream sandwich has the camera there but
it's nice you can drag applications
right in there and it will quick launch
for you so there's the camera for
example go ahead and close out of here
the next big selling point and one
things we mentioned in our specs
overview is the be on the back not the
buffalo this is beats audio and
unfortunately this is something that
you're gonna have to take my word for it
because I can't really show you what it
sounds like but I will say that it comes
with a pair of I beats headphones can
see them right here with inline mic
built in all kinds of controls
management and that kind of stuff do the
microphone there's the little pinhole
Mike and all your controls here the I
beats these do come in the box and are
about a hundred dollar value so
essentially their beats technology it's
kind of a skin to music player with
beats and able it's got a special sound
profile it sounds good I definitely
noticed a difference with the I beats
but it wasn't a giant difference I used
the I beats in a non Beats Audio
official device and sounded pretty good
the Beats Audio is a fun logo it
wouldn't be a compelling reason to go
out and buy the phone unless you want a
really good pair of headphones you're
looking to buy anyway it sort of wrap
them all into one package so let's talk
a little bit about the design kind of
interesting and I do like that these
buttons are painted on here they're not
back but they don't disappear your
capacitive buttons across the bottom
pretty standard Android fair here got
your HTC home button which is sort of
like a what kind of shape would that be
so it does I don't know look like a
house you've got a menu button a back
button and a search button
on the left hand side of device that's
where sharing is going to live on the
right hand side is a sort of hard to
recognize with your thumb and difficult
to push volume rocker up and down you'll
also notice that you don't have a camera
button here just want to design q I
really wish this head on the top 3.5
millimeter headset jack when you're
holding it like you would a phone my
favorite position the power n lock
button there is in the upper right hand
corner you've got your microphones and
such on the bottom and top you've got
this rubber back I really do love the
HTC build quality whether or not they
use metal or rubber plastic it always
feels really high-quality no exception
here this is sort of a kind of an HTC
incredible look with the different
layers of height on the side as you can
see that and all this makes for a very
heavy phone especially you compare it
with one of the other flagship phones
and verizon's lineup here this is the of
course the droid razr of course at the
thinnest end and the thinnest then you
can see a huge difference but even in
the fattest end to the fattest end you
can see that it's still even a little
bit thinner so this is by no means a
thin phone it's also by no means a light
phone away five point seven eight ounces
I do wish that the bottom was all one
was at one altitude I guess about the
right way to say that but I do wish that
all had one perhaps that would have made
it for a bit of a thinner experience but
does stay pretty flat it's not going to
have rock that some other older HTC
devices heads so the price a pretty
solid as you're using it if you want to
to type speaking of typing the more I
use it the less of a fan I become of the
HTC keyboard here I don't know why it
feels cramped maybe it's the screen size
but I just didn't like using especially
with the sea of other great Android
keyboards out there even the stock
Android want to really enjoy but one of
the nice things about open source
operating system is you don't like the
keyboard you can replace it with one you
like I know there are a lot of swype
fans out there from the camera
standpoint it's it's pretty average
camera nowadays takes decent pictures
it's got some
well some average low light visibility
was pretty good in direct sunlight
nothing to write home about you're not
going to necessarily want to replace
this with your point and shoot but when
you do want to snap a quick picture too
it's going to be fine for you I'm not
that much of a camera snob or even a
camera expert pictures looked at decent
i wasn't going to blow him up and make
posters of them but if i wanted to share
him on facebook the camera quality was
all right the battery I didn't want to
talk about it's a 1620 million of hours
which sounds like a pretty big battery
but when you factor in a 4.3 inch screen
with that high of a ppi and dual core
and LTE you're in theory going to have a
recipe for battery drain and disaster
and while certainly not disastrous I had
a difficult time getting through a full
day with the HTC Rezound and my day may
differ than your day but with two emails
constantly being pulled in about an hour
and a half to two hours of phone calls
pretty regular web checking on here I
barely got home around eight o'clock and
the battery was just about to keel over
so you may want to keep a spare handy
and one of the things that this offer is
that something like the droid razr does
not is that battery go ahead and turn
that off as actually user replaceable
it's got kind of a cool red look to it
on the back as well I'm go ahead and get
this off it's hard and it looks key oh
there we go that's where the batteries
gonna live it's also where you're 16 gig
extra external card is going to be as
well so you can put an extra battery you
can get that extra charge if you need
you are going to want to be judicious
though if you're traveling and they're
not going to be near a charger for a
full day so do i recommend this phone
yeah I absolutely recommend this phone
if you're on Verizon and you're looking
for a really solid option especially if
you are looking towards Android I'd be
hard-pressed to not recommend the
resound certainly if size is a concern
for you you may be better off looking at
something like the droid razr
with its Kevlar back and sort of thin
design but if you're looking for sort of
Ross specs it's going to be very hard to
be the display of the HTC Rezound if you
have tremendous eyesight and I started
to mention this more and more reviews
because this blaze get better and better
is it coming more important you're going
to really like this phone if you wear
glasses sometimes and your eyesight
might not be perfect 2020 or even better
this is the phone you're going to want
to try accidentally in the store to make
sure you can read the text when you're
browsing a website for someone like me
again with not the best I sites I could
live with it and I could be very happy
you're reading text doing my little zoom
action but it wouldn't be the most ideal
I'd prefer a lower resolution however if
you watch a lot of video or you look
watch a lot of media pictures or what
have you on your phone it's going to be
really hard to beat that resolution so
you sort of get both sides of that coin
Beats Audio is a nice sort of addition
but it's by no means reason to go out
and get this phone I get those
headphones included which is you know
great so this phone would definitely get
recommended if size is going to be a
concern you want a bigger display you're
going to want to look at some of the
other options and verizon's lineup but
if looking for 4.3 inches really
incredible resolution fast phone is
going to be a great choice HTC is said
ice cream sandwich will be coming no
official date as to when that's going to
be but you will expect to get some cold
tasty dessert on this sometime in 2012
and if you're looking to get this again
Galaxy Nexus is also coming out so you
might want to do some cross shopping I
