TechnoBuffalo here and i want to give
you a speed test horizons just lunch 4g
network I've got one of their to launch
of Isis here this is their pantech 4g
USB modem let's go ahead and see if 4g
lives up to the speed hype so you've
gone a bit guerilla style with the
camera angle here the vzaccess manager
software that the two launching 4g
modems need to run as currently windows
only so we've boot camps on the imac
into windows seven so i want to give you
first a speed comparisons you can see
what a home network looks like versus
the 4g network my home network is
relatively fast off the fastest in the
world but it's pretty decent Oh will you
speedtest.net here to check the home
network speed just the basis for
comparison I've been in Southern
California so we will use the Los
Angeles server let's go ahead and get
started a verizon is claiming 4g real
world download speeds of about five to
eight megabits per second and the upload
speeds of about one two three so my home
network is a hauling along pretty fast
here is actually a much quicker test and
i usually get generally i'm about 15 or
so megabits per second I got 20 2.12
down and on the up it's relatively quick
here hovering just about eight or nine
megabits per second down nothing just
window up so you can come back and
compare all right so this is my home
Wi-Fi network pretty quick nothing
that's going to sort of set any records
but again it does get the job done so on
my home network here if I want to
download mp3 it's going to take me two
seconds of five mega mega bytes if I
want to download a video clip but thirty
five megabytes go and take 13 seconds
and the 800 megabyte movie is going to
take me five minutes so I've got the USB
modem right here I've got a USB
extension cable right here it's go ahead
and plug it in this is the pantech so it
sort of swivels a little bit this USB
part comes out and I want to connect
this in real times you can see how well
this actually takes go ahead and plug it
in we'll see some LED lights light up
there let me know it's connected takes a
minute or two to power on the device I'm
go ahead and pull the modem down I'm
going to
close this I'm going to launch the
vzaccess manager software you can see it
loading right here and it's telling me
that it's connecting and that it's
initializing right now still takes a bow
let's say about 30 seconds from initial
plug-in to actually being able to
connect to the device so there it is
I've got my 4g LTE network connected oh
god i hovered between 12 bars of 4g so
i'll go ahead and actually keep myself
connected so I've got now one bar 4g you
can see the easy access is connected
there are some other networks here
that's poignant via Wi-Fi but I do have
one bar of 4g so let's go ahead and run
the speed test again using the 4g modem
let's go ahead and start the test will
use the same la server let's see what
the speeds are on the 4g modem so we're
getting very quick speeds here 16
megabits per second down which is faster
than most home networks and looks like
we're going to be getting a torso
megabits up I mean to really lightening
fast speeds and these speeds are
actually pretty reflective of other
tests that I've done when i took this
outside and i used a laptop I was
generally getting between 12 and 15 or
so megabits per second down the upload
speed here is extremely fast and that
maybe do just to lack of network traffic
currently on the 4g network there aren't
that many people on it so again for
service and speed comparisons here i'm
good download a mp3 a 5-megawatt
megabytes in three seconds 35 megabyte
video clip in 18 seconds and an 800
megabyte movie in seven minutes my home
network here is a little bit faster not
by much in fact the upload is actually
faster than my home network so what does
this mean for you well if you are an
avid Internet user you are going to be
getting some crazy fast speeds if you
get 4G sir
I expect needs to slow down a little bit
as a network becomes more mature and
more people start coming on it let's go
ahead and go to youtube and see how this
looks in a real world environment so
I've got my Mac versus PC video here
playing let's go ahead and go to that
page let's kick it up to 720p see
there's any trouble with the buffer
there there we go 720p no problem at all
the buffers moving right along go ahead
and edit play nice and smooth if I full
screen it there is no problem at all i
can jump around almost at the end of the
video which is now just about fully
buffered and now it is all done i can
play it and it plays a very very
smoothly without any issues whatsoever
really nice and again you can see that i
am indeed connected that tells me what
my data usage was to the 4g network and
i now have two bars of 4g right here so
i really noticed no difference in speed
p my home network and the 4g so if
you're looking for something to to game
with on the go if you can live within
the cap for data just currently going to
be fifty dollars for five gigs or eighty
dollars for 10 and then ten dollars per
overage for each gigabyte you're going
to be getting fantastic network speeds
here this thing really just hulls anyway
guys I am jon rettinger from
TechnoBuffalo and i'll see you in the
next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
