forever you can love it or hate it but
it's kind of become a staple in the
Ultrabook market and it's a machine
that's one of the best all-around
performers out there but the design was
getting a little stale and without much
of a change since 2015 it was time for
Dell to do something so they did and it
may not look much different from the
outgoing models but the new XPS 13 packs
some new improved changes on the inside
and out though not without a few
compromises that may make it a
deal-breaker a referee rosenthal Tucker
Buffalo and here's a look at the brand
new and slightly improved XPS 13 okay
I'm just gonna say it I really wanted to
like the white and rose gold color combo
on this laptop but I just can't bring
myself to say I do it's a clean looking
machine and it's definitely grown on me
over the last two weeks I've been using
it but to me it makes the bezels as
small as they are around the Infinity
inch display stand out in a negative way
and I know I'm in the minority even hear
the TV offices and you guys probably
have your own opinion and that's totally
okay Dell does make a black and silver
option that is still available but to me
it makes what is a beautiful high-end
laptop from Dell look a little less
premium opening this thing up we can see
not much has changed inside but that's
not necessarily a bad thing we've got
the same keyboard that's still super
comfortable to type on and it's pretty
spacious especially considering the
whole size of this machine it's also
paired with a trackpad that is great
multi-touch support and gesture support
that works well for navigating around
the webcam has moved locations from the
side to the center right under the
display and it adds an additional IR
camera that makes the whole array
windows Hello compatible so I get Y del
put the camera there they wanted to keep
those bezels around the display as thin
as possible but the placement just
drives me nuts and anytime you go to use
it for a video conferencing or a Skype
call you'll be reminded why that
compromise for thin bezels did not do
you any favors in the camera department
another change on this new model
specifically on this white and rose gold
one is a new material used for the wrist
rest area the carbon fiber used on the
black model is swapped for a new woven
fiberglass material that's
to be light and durable and also
withstand some dirt
it feels pretty comfortable though I'm
personally more a fan of the feel and
finish of the carbon fiber model it's
purely subjective you're getting the
same super high quality display on this
model that we saw in the last gen but if
you can spend a little bit more money
when you go to purchase I'd highly
recommend paying for the 4k Ultra HD
panel over the standard 1080p both get
super bright both look good but that 4k
panel just looks exceptionally good the
optional fingerprint reader from last
year's model has also swapped locations
it's not sitting on top of the power
button which is nice it works well and
if you're not crazy about the windows
hello camera unlocking it's a good
alternative and now it comes standard on
all models which is super nice the guts
of this machine have also been refreshed
Intel's latest processor sits inside
giving you the ability to option up an
i7 processor and up to 16 gigs of RAM
when you go to buy there's not much to
say about performance the XPS handles
everything really well especially
considering those specs though you may
see some kind of percentage increase
with the processor speed on paper during
day-to-day usage while web browsing and
multitasking watching videos it's gonna
be just as speedy as the last gen and if
you want to see a little bit more about
how the XPS 13 could handle something
like Premiere Pro or gaming you can
click the link down below to check out
my other review I did on the last gen
XPS 13 it's all pretty much the same
except for when it comes to i/o the
biggest change to this refresh is
actually on the side of the machine the
USB type a port and Dell barrel power
connector have been replaced with USB
type-c ports there's two of them here
both these ports are Thunderbolt 3
compatible so they can be used for data
charging and even capable of running an
e GPU we looked up a razor core at our
offices here and it worked almost
completely plug and play on this machine
to be a real contender for that best of
both worlds gaming machine you can have
your light portable computer that you
can take around with you but come home
dock it with one cable and it could
become a more powerful contender for a
real gaming PC on the other side at
Delos swap to the SD card port for a
microSD card port and there is an
additional non Thunderbolt 3 USB C port
and a headphone jack I really do wish
Dell could have kept that full-size SD
card port even if it did make the
machine just a little thicker battery
life on this new model is still
outstanding that high resolution 4k
display will suckle
little bit more power than the Timmy P
panel but I was easily able to make it
through a 10 hour a day with moderate
usage and switching this thing into
extreme power saving mode was able to
get me a little bit more juice on the
days I needed it the rest of this laptop
is exactly the same as previous models
and again that's not a bad thing the
price on the new XPS 13 ranges anywhere
from $9.99 all the way up to our highest
end model that we have here that comes
in just shy of 2,000 bucks in every tier
though you're getting a good amount of
performance for your dollar even with
the base model having an i5 or gigs of
ram and an SSD inside okay so to kind of
wrap things up the change is made to
this refresh are small but I think
they're an important step in making an
already great little book even better
there are some compromises that Dell has
made that still just anointing in terms
of design and ports and webcam placement
but as an overall package you're getting
an incredible looking machine that is
honestly probably one of the best
Windows laptops that you could go out
and buy today so what do you guys think
of the refreshed Dell XPS 13 you like me
a little bit of herkiman when it comes
to giving up those full size USB eight
ports in favor of USB type-c I know the
USB type-c feature is coming but leave a
