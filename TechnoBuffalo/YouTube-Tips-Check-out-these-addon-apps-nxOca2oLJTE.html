TechnoBuffalo here a week or so ago I
did a video showing you the apps that I
had on my iPhone and a few weeks before
that I showed you the apps that I had on
my Android device and I got a lot of
questions about some of the apps on here
so I'm gonna do a series of a few videos
focusing in on some of the apps that I
use most on my device and how they can
help you so let's jump into this YouTube
folder now if you run a YouTube channel
you've got a YouTube channel it could be
hard to manage it especially from the
default each about that I think you guys
all know about but there are a few other
apps that Google makes that are
incredibly useful and sort of create a
really well-rounded experience for
managing your YouTube channel so I'm not
gonna jump into the YouTube app chances
are you already have that the one you
should really be using is the one called
Studio when you upload a YouTube video
oftentimes you'll see the view count
gets stopped at 301 or another number
this will give you actual numbers for
your view counts here's a video that we
uploaded yesterday Apple music is here
it says on YouTube it's got 23,000 views
but if I click this and go into more
analytics that'll actually jump up
29,000 so you can actually see that
that's the real view count or at least
as close you can get as accurate it'll
also give you earning information such I
believe that triggers about 48 hours
afterwards you can also do some comment
managing here so you can select and you
can delete it thumb it up flag it or
reply to it it's really helpful from an
analytic standpoint across the top
you'll see your views your minutes watch
their our subscribers you've gained I
believe over the past 30 days a few
other cool things this can do at first
that was a dashboard you can also go
through and view all your analytics and
all your videos just pick one and you
can jump right in but something to keep
in mind it's only going to show you
information for the past 48 hours for
example if I go to an older video here
so video I was talking out what's on my
iPhone six-plus
during 64 thousand if I click it's gonna
show much less so it only has eight
thousand six hundred views over the past
48 hours so at least bear that in mind
jumping back into the menu you can also
go ahead and manage your comments see
more analytics that's going to open the
YouTube app and the next one's going to
open the capture app which I'll show you
next if you have multiple YouTube
accounts really helpful and go ahead and
select that and you can manage all of
your accounts and jump right in as long
as you're signed in then you can manage
your accounts right down below really
helpful you don't have to sign in log
out log in of different accounts this is
one that I use every day and is
incredibly helpful to run a YouTube
channel so if you haven't tried it
give it download it's free and something
that's I think really helpful to use I
capture if you use your phone to upload
to YouTube a great way to do that you
can show you how this works go ahead and
open it up jump back into camera this is
what you guys gonna look like when you
see it it's gonna ask you to rotate it
first so I'll go ahead and do that in a
corner you can just start recording you
can turn the flash on or off or you can
switch the cameras gonna do front-facing
if y'all do that so I can see myself
there we'll go ahead and switch back
then you can simply just start recording
and you can upload directly from there
but usually what I do is I'll record
separately
you didn't go ahead and pull clips
together so we can go ahead and see all
the clips you've got right here you can
see the length of them so 26 seconds 12
seconds they're all from the premiere of
ant-man I did by the way put a make this
videos what it's like to be at the
premiere of a man on the inside Jon's
mine channels put a link to that down
below what that looks like so I'll grab
a clip here I can use ik if I wanted I
want to add another clip I can go ahead
and add an existing clip like final one
I want put that together you can preview
it looks good it's used it'll drop it
right next to it I can do that again
Eike record a new clip or add another
existing one you know I can go ahead and
find one that I like so it's here's one
of me talking perfect choose that go
ahead and add music if you want you can
click right there and add some you look
give you some options from your device
or from YouTube soundtracks do a little
bit of editing you go ahead and hit next
you can simply start uploading tell you
where it's gonna upload to put in your
title and you're good to go
if I don't do any uploading from your
phone there's some great apps to use and
some of these are things that people
don't know about the YouTube studio one
for example has really really been
helpful for managing a channel I'll let
you see a little more closely and grand
really how you're doing so I wanted to
give you guys just some tips on sort of
what I use to manage YouTube channel of
course we've got kids YouTube kids is
just the way to you kids videos on
YouTube
energy wanted to give you guys a quick
video show you some of the apps that I
use lets give you more detail on the
previous video that I made and I thank
