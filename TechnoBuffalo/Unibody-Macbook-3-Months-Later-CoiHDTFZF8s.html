may have seen this video a few days ago
I posted a three-month Matt book review
but the audio and video were all out of
sync and it just didn't look right I
want to go ahead and do it over again
hopefully have my words match the
movement in my mouth so if you're
watching this again hope you guys enjoy
I know it's been about three months
since i've had the new aluminum unibody
macbook that you have the 2.4 gigahertz
AI become increasingly impressed with it
each and every day there are many things
i like about even some things i don't so
we're going to cover each of those first
thing build quality has been absolutely
fantastic I carry this with me in a bag
to and from school every day and it's
been absolutely fantastic I don't have
any dents I'm have any scratches all it
is is just in an incase leave in
essentially a backpack and just been
absolutely durable and fantastic with no
slowdown issues one of the biggest
problems I had with my old macbook pro
was that it got incredibly hot and you
could flip it over and cook dinner on it
this thing cool as a cucumber it gets a
little bit hot in the back left corner
but not nearly to the degree of the
macbook pro and the heat is just
localized so credit to Apple for making
a cool on both ways computer absolutely
fantastic performance wise I haven't
noticed any drop off from the old
macbook pro this is able to handle what
little games are clay on it all the
video editing I do just been absolutely
fantastic I have a misfire wire on the
right knee to use firewire I use an iMac
which is actually only been once so for
me latke firewire has not been an issue
at all very well though maybe for you I
love the screen I love the look of the
computer I'm a big fan of glossy faux
fur for me that was the problem I think
it makes colors pop a little bit more
not a professional photo editor so I
don't need true blacks and true colors
but for my uses the casual user it's
been actually fantastic there are
several times when I have to use Windows
Vista for school related activities and
it's been awesome being able to have
both have vista work perfectly and you
know if you one put windows seven on it
or XP you can definitely do that it's
been really nice having the option of
having both and really the best of all
worlds as far as I'm concerned so that's
been
very enjoyable keyboard I've written 12
fake papers on the sink the keyboard is
great it's nice easy to use it feels
like a full keyboard essentially the
same as the external wireless Apple slim
keyboard so it was very easy adjustment
some of this stuff I don't like about
this I'm not such a fan to track pad no
hear me out here I loved gestures on the
trackpad I use a forefinger expose hide
the desktop all the time absolutely
great I give the three fingers swipe sir
are awesome what gets annoying those I
do a lot of work in Excel and in tiny
little cells what I'm trying to right
click you know whether I'm clicking in
or just tapping it's not always so
precise and sometimes the mouse can jump
around when I'm tapping or clicking so
I've got little on the annoying side so
actually had to go and buy and you guys
saw me in box in microsoft arc mouse to
use when i'm using excel or using any
small areas i like the way the trackpad
feels i like the way it looks but i
probably would have liked to have had a
button even if I gonna have to control
click or two fingers and click think it
would have been a nice compromise I
think what the macbook air has is
probably perfect you still get the
swipes which are pretty kick ass and you
also get an actual tactile button which
is pretty awesome as well so I don't
love the trackpad it's not nearly a deal
killer at all but you know I have some
gripes with it if if you're interested
so people have been asking me why I got
the 2.4 model and i'll tell you i got it
just for the backlit keyboard when i
take notes of class sometimes dark
lecture hall and I'm not the best a
touch typing sometimes I'm a hot pack
kind of guy to really want to be able to
see the keyboard if you're deciding
between the two point over the 2.4
you're not really going to notice much
of a difference I don't think with the
point for difference in that regards
speed so if the backlit keyboards not
important to you the 2 point 0 will be a
fantastic computer I don't think you'll
notice really any performance issues one
way or another to be honest so maybe
that'll save you a couple hundred bucks
but if you guys do need firewire and if
you need higher end graphics card and
definitely go macbook pro but for the
general
Sumer could it be happy with their
macbook guys I love it I think you will
too it's probably one of the best
computer purchases that I've ever made
and I continue to be impressed with it
on a daily basis so guys hope you
enjoyed the three-month review of the
macbook if you want some exclusive
