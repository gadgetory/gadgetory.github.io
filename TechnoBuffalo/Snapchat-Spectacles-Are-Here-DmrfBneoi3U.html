their new spectacles on sale over in
Venice the only way you can get us
through this vending machine that they
have down by the boardwalk so we hopped
in the car we're on our way up there
right now I'll see see how crazy is
online it looked like there is a line
outside of it so hoping we get there in
time before they sell out well let the
lines too long I came prepared we got
something to entertain ourselves with on
our way down here we found out that
bulletproof coffee is right next door so
we thought we'd just run in real quick
and get a cup of course yet they hit it
when we're in Venice all right finally
we got coffee so we're all set let's go
you
dude I knew we should have brought that
bottle of rum
alright so the line is taking forever
I'm gonna run and get some food real
fast just picked up a couple for retos
hear these things are pretty badass then
it's selling out before we made it to
the line we waited about like an hour
and a half and we didn't make it like
halfway through so we ended up buying
one off of one of the shop guys who is
set up right next door so got spectacles
is where they look like coming in this
container you have it looks like a foam
case of some sort to hold it pop them
out and go spectacles alright so we just
picked them up put them on so more or
less you'll see on the top here there's
a button when you press that it's gonna
require a 10 second video and then if
you hold it down it will stop recording
us if you want to do something shorter
we're snapchatting right now from the
spectacles one of the fruits down there
this is I'd your snapchat selfies now
get a selfie stick for my sunglasses
we have the usual interface very
familiar with except you have a new tab
called specs there's more like cool
things about it the snap actually you
can reorient the phone and see a
different perspective or landscape or
portrait you're able to kind of
basically really navigate around through
the video that's captured right out of
the spectacle camera so that's kind of
cool little feature that's an overview
of the snapchat specs goals are pretty
cool there a lot fun to play with a
little hard to get your hands on right
now but hopefully becoming two more city
sometime soon I gotta go at this video
right now so I got to take off but first
let me take a selfie eating</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
