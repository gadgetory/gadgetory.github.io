the pantech matrix pro people wanted to
see what the iPhone looked like
head-to-head with a windows mobile 6.1
professional device so a touchscreen so
the king of touchscreen windows mobile
devices at least carrier at least ones
in the US is the HTC Touch pro scene
here in HTC fuse clothing overseas and
in Europe in other countries they
released the touch HD that hasn't been
released here so at least in the US this
is the current reigning king so I'm
gonna do the same set of comparisons and
the same rules that I use for the last
one I'm gonna compare unlocking the
device changing ringtones going from
ring to vibrate sending a text viewing a
webpage adding a contact and adding a
new calendar item so let's go ahead and
get started to unlock the iPhone go see
your poly familiar the device is locked
hit the fight at the top slide little
bar over and your device is unlocked for
the HTC fuse here or the touch pro and
also the touch of diamond I have it set
where I push this button at the top that
essentially turns off the screen and I
have to screen is totally dead if I push
the button to top again it unlocks it
nice and easy so if you want to change
ringtones let me show you how to do that
on the iPhone you go to settings sounds
ringtone you can go ahead and scroll
through and pick whichever ringtone you
choose it's a few few steps but nothing
terribly difficult so here on the fuse
I'm going to use a stylus for this since
it is a resistive touch screen you
scroll all the way over and this is
running touchflo 3d it's HTC's
proprietary skin on windows mobile 6.1
so that's where all this scrolling
across the bottom as icons are coming
from it's a HTC add-on so we'll go to
sound
scroll up ring type and ring tone and
here you can scroll through and select
the ring tone not terribly difficult
so that's thing you want to do if you
want to go from ring to vibrate say
you're going a meeting or going to class
and you don't want your phone to ring
more you do want it to ring how do you
change it well your iPhone makes it nice
and easy there's a little switch on the
side flip it up now it's on ring flip it
down and now it's on vibrate very easy
on the HTC touch pro if you go back
again to the settings menu go to sounds
and here you can choose your profile
silent ring vibrate you can go to normal
and there you go you can also use the
volume control on the side you can
scroll down now it's on vibrate or go
all the way back up terrain it actually
looks very nice so I give HTC a lot of
credit for implementing a very good
looking system here so let's say you
want to send a text I send a lot of text
I'm sure you do as well how do you do it
well let me go ahead and show you guys
so on the iPhone go ahead and hit SMS
I'm gonna cover up my text messages here
but there's a button right there to
create a new text go ahead and hit it
now you can create a new text message
nice and simple on the touch pro there's
actually a text messaging tab that HTC
put in here scroll over see it says text
messages right there well let go hit
that button to create a new text and
you're off if you're using a touch
diamond you have to use the on-screen
keyboard which shows up right there but
since this is a touch pro it's got a
full slide-out cordeen go ahead and type
away so we'll go back to the home screen
the next thing I wanted to show you guys
was how to view a web page how easy it
is how simple it is and what the web
pages look like well on Safari it's nice
and easy go ahead hit safari hit the
address bar at the top type in your
address using the on-screen keyboard and
you are good to go nice and simple I'm
sure most you are probably
familiar with it well the HTC touch pro
is interesting they actually don't use
Pocket Internet Explorer as a default
browser HTC actually bundled Opera
Mobile which is a fantastic browser
infinitely better than Internet Explorer
that usually on these devices let me
show you guys how that works take your
finger and scroll over here Internet
launch Medianet there isn't a SIM card
in here I'm not sure this connected to
Wi-Fi but I can still show you just the
same how it works there's the address
bar and go ahead and tap it right there
and begin typing using the on-screen
keyboard or the slide-out QWERTY really
nice and simple go back home so let's
say you want to add a new contact like I
said in the last video you're out of the
bar you just met a girl you want to add
her phone number or you just met a buddy
and you want at his phone number
whatever let me show you guys how to do
that it's actually relatively simple so
on the iPhone you go to contacts so I'll
scroll over here hit contacts cover up
my contacts here as well and there's a
plus sign right there you go ahead and
hit plus and go ahead and add a new
contact nice and easy you can pick
whomever you want type in their name
again using the on-screen keyboard and
you're off so four contacts on the HTC
go ahead and hit that little people guy
right there and if you had picked your
contacts in here you can actually scroll
through them this is a sidenote
kind of a neat addition that HTC added
with touchflo 3d it's not found on most
windows mobile devices this is just for
a touch flow-3d so go ahead and hit all
people that brings you to the default
Windows Mobile contacts you can kind of
scroll through with your finger go ahead
hit and new then you go ahead and add
your contact using your stylus and
whichever keyboard method you choose if
you want to add a new calendar item
we'll go back to the home screen here a
lot of people commented on my calendar
and how I got that little one to show up
right there
it's actually because I'm using exchange
server I'm gonna use a Microsoft
Exchange server we actually get calendar
notifications and calendar pop-ups and
that's where that one comes from it's
not a standard iPhone firmware thing
it's just if you're using exchange
server for your mail
so it's add a new calendar item nice and
easy
go ahead and pick calendar it's like
everything else in the iPhone hit the
plus time and you're off and it's
actually relatively easy on the HTC as
well so use this screen here the MICEX
are the main home screen you can flip
through with your finger to get
different information but in this case
we want to use a calendar so I'll hit
calendar and it launches the default
Windows Mobile calendar go ahead to the
menu hit new appointment notice these
menu items are big so it should be
finger friendly and hit a new
appointment and enter your information
you know pretty simple on the windows
mobile device as well I want to give you
guys a comparison and I'm not trying to
slant you in one way or another just
want to show you the differences with
the things that you may do quite
regularly on your iPhone or Windows
Mobile Device again like I mentioned
earlier keep in mind all Windows Mobile
touchscreen devices are not gonna look
like this is this is running touchflo 3d
on top of Windows Mobile but to show you
that it really is Windows Mobile you see
the Start screen and hit that then you
get your typical Start menu so guys John
