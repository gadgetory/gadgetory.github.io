to you by godaddy what's up everyone
welcome back there pisode of asta
buffalo i am your host jon rettinger in
the ass the buffalo chair is to show we
could ask me any question you've got
world of technology and sometimes
outside of this week we're to talk about
what we do with phones after we review
them how I prepare for videos personally
talking about the note 4 and what's next
for the iphone says the buffalo let's
start asking the first question comes
from our fuzzy friend owes us hi John
what did you with the phones after your
tests and reviews we do you really
wanted two things with them either we
send them back right away our phones
usually come with the three-week loan
period or if it's a flagship device last
hold on to it for the duration of that
phone's lights Bank use it for
comparisons for the devices we as in
videos and also just for benchmarking
purposes but once or the next generation
comes out those phones go right back to
the PR agency unless of course that we
buy them then we can either keep them or
we'll sell them after the fact but all
the phones go back we don't really keep
or horde much here so all the phones you
see we don't just have closets of
flagship phones that get get released
they all go back to PR agencies next
question comes from at a blog who asked
at John for lakers how do you prepare
for your videos so it depends mark and I
have very different ways to prepare for
videos almost all of my videos are
totally unscripted I'm a lot to best
reading from a script you doin things
just come out of my mind and come out my
mouth as when I met my best but things
like asked to Buffalo for example I've
got the questions just written on in
front of me on a prompter but that's
really it their answers kind of come out
of my head I want a big reviews or
comparison Jared I'll put an outline so
let's say I'm reviewing whatever the
Galaxy Note 4 to talk about in a minute
you know I'll put a disclaimer would be
what it'll say and then it will say
screen and then it'll say battery life
and camera and then I sort of go through
the dildos and I've already served under
review already in my head and I'll go
and just just talk mark does her the
opposite approach mark does a lot of
scripts and that he'll sort of do
voiceovers with heavy b-roll on it to
start different ways to do the same type
of video but for me I've always worked
out well just to sort of talk which is
probably watching my videos get a little
rambling so fit up answer question next
question comes from at ninja
explosions at John for lakers what do
you think of the galaxy note 4 league I
think it looks exactly like everybody
expected it to look like a little bit
bigger and I'm say kabli Samsung the gen
the galaxy note 3 is sort of a pretty
iconic device that had a new leather
fake leather back to it and it sort of
just a small evolution on the galaxy
note 2 these be the same thing in the
galaxy note 4 with most flagship devices
there's big hype and speculations going
to have crazy screens on the sides a lot
kind of stuff not going to happen a
little better display a little better
processor and that kind of stuff but
look certainly if you like big phones
like the Galaxy Note line probably like
what's going to come next we stopped the
questions for one quick SEC to thank the
good peeps at godaddy always had an idea
for a website and you just want to
create it you can start today with
godaddy it's just a dollar ninety-nine
cents per domain enter promo code 199
techno at checkout I've got that idea
what is what the started now is the
ideal time some imitations oh might
applies to check out the website for
details back to the questions and last
but not least comes from at the j for
messi class who asked at john for lakers
bowl apple's next big feature on the
iphone be very good question here's what
i'm hoping this is all just sort of hope
no really really to back it up
concretely i'm hoping to have some sort
of NFC built-in not just bailed transfer
pictures and files but for mobile
payments apple's been way way behind
there are cases you could put on that'll
enable Isis payments or even Google
Wallet but Apple is lagged way behind on
that I'm also hoping for some sort of
wireless charging hopefully it's a the
chief standard but Apple obstacle
proprietary is probably some whatever
Apple air charge I love just charging my
phone why erson hoping that apple will
do that I know for you guys jump down my
throat and be like Android has those
four years it's true now Android has
definitely add those four years
hopefully apples going to catch up in
those features and sort of offer them to
the masses probably with a very fresh
callosity coat of paint a little bit of
lipstick and try and call it sexy like
the brand new but iOS users have been
waiting for word hopefully they're gonna
get at this generation they can sprout
