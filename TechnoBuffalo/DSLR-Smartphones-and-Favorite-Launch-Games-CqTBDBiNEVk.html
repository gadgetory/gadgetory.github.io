to you by audible hello internet and
welcome back to another episode of ask
the Buffalo the show where you can ask
me actually ask ever any question you
might have from the wild world of
technology and maybe beyond every
tuesday we put up a call for questions
at TechnoBuffalo calm you can leave your
question in the post comment otherwise
just send them to me anytime of the day
or night on twitter at TechnoBuffalo or
at Ashley ask ebba just use the hashtag
ask the be so I can see it usually I'll
answer between three and five questions
every episode so let's get answering
because this is ask the Buffalo Mitch
asks hey Ashley with a major emphasis on
a camera within a smart phone these days
do you think we are getting close to the
day where a DSLR sensor may soon be put
into a phone if so what do you think
that will do to the DSLR market well
Mitch so here's the deal I would love
more than anything to see a company like
canon or nikon put a lens of theirs that
they developed and manufactured into a
phone like say the Nexus 5 it would be
amazing obviously I would die for
something like that i'm a huge AV geek
all i want is more power in my
smartphone cameras unfortunately there's
a couple of problems with that number
one is cost to the consumer that's
definitely gonna be a cost that's past
the end of the consumer and I don't
think a DSLR style or caliber lens is
gonna cost you 1 99 on contracts I'm
gonna cost you a lot more than that so
that's probably number one reason why
it's not gonna happen and the second one
is cannibalizing their own line of
point-and-shoot phones so companies like
canon and nikon might have a shrinking
market for point shoot but they really
don't necessarily have a shrinking
market in DSLR i think it's actually
growing because a lot of people are
feeling well my smartphone is my
point-and-shoot now so I'm gonna get a
prosumer camera and then they get a
camera like the 70d so I would say those
are the two big reasons we won't
actually see that come to the market but
with Sony's qx100 we might see something
like that where Canon and Nikon make a
device that actually attaches to your
smartphone and then uses their lens
technology to take a picture veigar
tasks hi ashley what is the one
technological device you cannot
out and why my car is the one
technological device I couldn't live
without I know that doesn't seem like a
technological device anymore it seems
very mechanical but I would pretty my
live and die by my car I mean it's the
only way I can come to work it's the
only way I can go to see my family um
there are a million reasons why I love
my car but if I had to pick a gadget I
would definitely say my smartphone i
mean that's that's the device my whole
life is inside the thing on my pictures
all my stuff but you know if i didn't
have a car really have a lot of other
ways of getting around in southern
california we don't have public
transportation like a lot of you guys
out there we kind of do and it's kind of
ok so i would say my car first but if i
had to pick a little gadget i would
obviously say my smartphone Tanner or at
then Dyson I hope I got that right asks
out of every launch game of the ps4 and
xbox one which one is your favorite
there's only one answer to this question
obviously it's resogun for the
PlayStation 4 I don't care if it's on
playstation plus i don't care if it's an
indie developer house mark did an
incredible job it's probably one of the
most polished watch titles out of both
consoles and well it's just really fun
so yeah resogun ryan asks hey Ashley
what do you and the rest of the herd do
in your spare time do you guys hang out
or thanks the thing about technobuffalo
is we don't actually see each other a
whole lot outside of work but being here
in the office is our hanging out so we
spend all of our days hanging out here
and having a fun time like nerf wars we
have baskets of cookies that we all
share it's delicious I will joke around
hang out everything all day we get a lot
of work done but we also play hard too
so it's just really fun to hang out
during the day time here at the office
so I think we've had enough of each
other by the end of the day and then we
all go home and and then I get sad
because i miss lucy lucy johnson lucy is
literally my favorite part of coming
into the office but everyone else is all
right too I gotta interrupt the show for
just a quick second to talk about our
good friends and sponsors at audible
