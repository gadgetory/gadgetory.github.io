TechnoBuffalo here there's been a ton of
awesome things announced and showing off
at Google i/o 2014 but one of the
coolest things is right behind me
project tango this looks like a regular
tablet but it is anything but let's get
a walk through a powder tango and see
what you could expect to maybe come to
your tablet over the coming years so my
name is Johnny Lee I'm the technical
part at project lead for project tango
and what we've been doing with these
devices is maturing the hardware and
software for actually doing full 3d
tracking and mapping with a device so
our goal is to give devices a
human-scale understanding of space and
motion so just a little bit of a
technical dive on what's in these
devices we have especially hardware and
software for tracking the motion of the
tablet itself so what we have on the
left side is a feed of the fisheye lens
and you can see the cameraman right
behind you as well as all these green
points which basically is the computer
vision stack running but what it allows
us to do is if I move the tablet to the
left and right you can actually see I
can actually draw the path of the
devices in real time so what this means
is that I basically have the ability to
have motion capture capability in a
device stand into itself so if I were to
just unplug this cable and walk around
the whole Moscone Center and we'd
actually know roughly where that was
relative to where I was in real time so
we draw a line along path the other
thing that we have in these devices is
an integrated depth sensor and what that
allows us to do is capture 3d geometry
of the surrounding environment so this
is kind of a third-person view of the
with what people standing in front of us
and you can kind of see the shape you
can see this table here
and rotate it and you can see the
profile view of the doors and under the
shelf and so what this allows us to do
is not only understand where the device
is but the geometry in front of us one
of the things we can use this for is
actually controlling the camera inside
of a game this is one of our sample SDK
apps called it we call cube mover and
they restart that and again what we've
done is we've taken the camera tracking
and and attach that to the virtual
camera but if I pick up this cube and
then drop it on this switch I need to
pick up match the cube color with the
switch and the blue cube is actually
over there so if I need to solve the
puzzle actually have to walk around my
space and come over here to pick up the
green cube over here I throw it to the
switch so anyway that's a little awkward
to do on camera but what it basically
means is that if I move through my
environment I can actually use that
information in the game so it sort of
introduces this idea of motion gaming
and space into a mobile device so we're
actively maturing this hardware and
we're gonna be releasing dev kits later
this year to allow early adopter
software developers who want to really
excited about exploring this space but
we're also in very active conversations
with OEMs and manufacturers to start
incorporating this technology into
hardware we would be very excited to see
consumer-grade Hardware coming into the
hands of lots of people next year so
what you guys could be looking at could
be the future of not only tablets but
phones the way we interact with them the
cameras are much more than taking
selfies you can do a crazy amount with
it and this is really at the forefront
of that I can't sort of overstate how
cool this is interpreter looking at the
future of what's going to be coming and
I'm excited to sort of see this make its
way to consumer devices I know you guys
thank you for watching hope you enjoy of
course check us out at TechnoBuffalo
comm see you next video
bye bye thank you guys for watching if
you haven't yet please subscribe would
be the first one to know and every
upload new content we've got new stuff
coming every single day we want to make
sure you see what's new in the world of
consumer electronics</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
