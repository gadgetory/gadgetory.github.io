compatible win and can we see sort of
how the Firefox OS it works on it too

features for us okay so and uh I think
it's a major difference of of the
Firefox is under you is that the rear on
to make it simplified so on that you can
see is that in homepage you have nothing
you don't have to shut icons and we did
here like i enjoy however is that they
when you whenever you download the
application systems we saw on the on the
right side of the home screen and roll
web-based applications right yeah jes√∫s
are based on their script or HTML 5 days
html5-based ok and then here is that the
more you download is then you have more
page extended and hear it below it's
actually this is the key applications
are where you have the foam core you
have the messaging of the contact and
the browser which is the 40 applications
that are
perfect if define it and then under on
the lab on the right side of here
basically they add a function of the
feedback so there the annual sir can
give whatever their feedbacks to their
to firefox to improve the users
usability of the of the phone and then
under on the left side of the idle
screens actually swipe here pixel every
time here is the market price of the of
the firefox that is automatically
categorize with the different categories
here where you can find a social social
application and gaming and other things
so all the applications you downloads
it's automatically categorize inside you
can find it here or you can go directly
to the search here to search whatever
the application you want to find and it
will will automatically direct you to

generation actually is more targeted of
the entry level but of course that

be an entry so right so you could see
high-end version yeah

launch one is that a partnership with
aqua toe actually we build up this phone
