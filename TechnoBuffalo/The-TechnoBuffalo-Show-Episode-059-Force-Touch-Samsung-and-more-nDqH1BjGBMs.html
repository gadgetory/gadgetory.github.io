TechnoBuffalo show as always I'm live
your to host for today Sean ani
editor-in-chief of the site i'm joined
by deputy managing editor todd Hazelton
hey everybody folks I'm just gonna
apologize in advance we're not quite
sure what's going on but there seems to
be a little bit of delay today between
Tata myself so you may notice a little
bit longer gaps than usual and Todd
replying to me and so forth but one
quick bit of housekeeping I wanted to
get to we have been notified by
listeners that when we set up the live
show I do it the day before and set it
you know for a scheduled time we were
not aware that makes it appear in your
subscription box twice it appears when i
first set it up and then it appears
again when the show goes live i am
trying to figure that out I do apologize
we certainly don't want to clutter up
your subscription box and we are aware
of it we're just trying to figure out a
solution all that being said moving on a
nothing going on this week Todd it's
going to be a quiet week yeah nothing no
we have Samsung tomorrow which seems
like it's going to be a big event we're
expecting the note 5 the galaxy s6 edge+
we've already sort of covered a lot of
that on the site so yeah really now it's
coming down to you know what are there
any surprises and what are they because
one teaser they showed seem to have
another device in it the big question is
what is that other device and we've been
expecting for a long time now that gear
a SmartWatch Tizen powered circular
SmartWatch that has pretty much leaked
in very detail with you know the
circular crown or whatever that you
could twist and move to navigate brand
new apps and stuff like that so whether
we see that tomorrow or not I don't know
it seems possible yeah for the sake of
this conversation folks we are assuming
that both those funds are coming
tomorrow so we're going to be discussing
strictly yeah we're going to be
discussing strictly what else we think
may be coming there and just before we
jumped on the show talk
you were saying there were some tablet
rumors circulating yes so recently I
mean one of the things I'm wondering is
are we going to see the Tab s2 tomorrow
for the United States it's already
available on some on the world but
Samsung hasn't made like a big splash
with it yet so I'm wondering if we're
going to see that in the United States
you know maybe carrier partners a
different version the tab and awesome
tablets super super skinny really
amazing quad HD display stuff like that
I think it was quad HD any case great
display and and then I just saw rumors
as I was sort of researching like you
know is there going to be an s2k united
states tomorrow I saw rumors of a tab
edge possibly so maybe that's what we'll
see to which can be cool because we
haven't seen a tablet with the edges and
I don't know if Samsung has the
capability he's sort of outfitted their
factories to make those kind of displays
I mean now I think with the rumored 5.7
inch edge that would be the largest but
maybe they can do it off tablet scale
too so I think there's going to be you
know possibly a lot tomorrow because
remember this is unpacked and that
Samsung's like big conference it's
what's usually in Berlin you know last
year we saw the note for where we saw
the note as we saw the new gear ours
which were brand new at the time now
they're available for the s6 and s6 edge
too so also I mean not the s6 edge
double and then you know so okies you
bet with it got two phones it there
could be plenty of things seems like it
avail hope so gotcha yeah it's a the
idea of an edge tablet really I I just
don't see that I don't see the reason
for again yeah because one of the
reasons the edge exists I mean it's
great for multimedia right because it
doesn't have like the bezels but also
with one-handed use you can swipe in
from the side on the s6 edge for example
and quickly view contacts or when the
phones facing down it closed a certain
color solo like that makes sense but on
a tablet like you have to wonder those
edges could probably be pretty annoying
in some instances
we're really great I don't know without
having seen it yeah Bob just real quick
this is totally off topic but i want to
just acknowledge this from shawn the man
34 who has been one of our most loyal
listeners i just want to say this will
be my last light podcast for a while
heading to college and have classes
during the day keep up the great work
guys well to you Sean the man 3 for what
I would say is clearly your priorities
are not in order you know if you feel
that your college classes somehow are
more important than hanging out with
Todd and myself on the type of Buffalo
show I fear for the future of the
country but uh kidding aside good luck
and we will definitely miss you and we
will have to hand over the reins of
asking Todd what he's returned to
somebody else yeah and I have the Apple
watch back this week count well moving
back to Sam sorry I just wanted to make
sure while Sean was here that we
acknowledged his departure um i I just I
don't know it's right I I think with a
tablet especially when you're trying to
work it like in landscape mode the edges
would get really annoying unless they
only do one edge which would be along
the top but then who's to say what's the
top some people rotate different way i I
just I don't see the edge being needed
on a tablet yeah exactly and I mean
because what we've seen the use case
scenarios right over like bedside mode
with the weather in the clock pickers
for like CNN and stuff like that stocks
and I just yeah I'm not sure that like
you would need that kind of
functionality that's how much puts him
so I could do other things too i mean
movie controls have been there which
would be great on a tablet my that those
would sort of your thumbs would
constantly get in a way versus like a
smart phones more manageable
hold for that kind of stuff but maybe
Samsung has it all figured out I mean I
don't think it would just launched this
product nilly willy we are talking about
in the past yes we're talking about at
least how many different sizes of
tablets at one of my you're right maybe
they would do it what was it it was the
tab 7.7 the 8.4 and yeah they have we've
covered like every screw green sighs
it'd be funny I gotta see like which
ones they've not done before well what
was the one we saw the rumor of last
week it was like a 24 inch deep cleaners
and ATT 17.8 17-point it was something
oh yeah hmm I'm sorry monitor who is who
is going to put a what is essentially a
flat-screen television the small flat
screen TV in their backpack yeah I just
can't imagine I mean maybe if it was
like a windows all in one you know that
that starts to kind of make sense and
they did have that I think a note 12.2
is probably the largest they've gone and
that's a big tablet so yeah yeah I just
I have no interest in 12 inch tablets no
interest let alone let alone 18 I mean a
9.7 inch or so tablet is perfect for me
I'm a big tablet user like when I lay
down in bed at night you know I'm first
thing when i wake up in the morning that
my ipad is the first thing I grab every
morning you know after I throw my alarm
across the room and start looking at you
know what the news is and all that sort
of stuff I but the idea of trying to
prop a 12 or 17.8 inch tablet up on my
chest while I'm laying in bed that's not
going to happen and you have to wonder
the price to like a 12 points you I
think that thing was like 800 bucks so
like a 17 inch tablet would be like can
you imagine spending more than a
thousand dollars on the android tablet
and i'm just throwing out numbers here
no way no way oh maybe they're doing
this anticipation of the ipad pro rumors
which isn't going to be 18 inches badly
yeah well something yeah but you can do
it in anticipation that ipad / all day
long but the thing is the pro is still
not a definitive a definite device
that's happening and right go and
leapfrog it by almost six inches okay
just a marketing bigger and better
writers ah you know something stopped me
when we get to the 55 inch tablets but
which isin that a smarty yeah which I
yes folks I realize that there are ones
you can mount on the wall and all that
stuff but it now anyway well moving on
so tomorrow should be interesting yeah
and Jacob will be there live we will be
having of course whatever they announced
will have you know we'll try to get
hands-on videos and do all our usual
specs shootouts and all that stuff so as
I said we're assuming it's the two
phones we don't know for sure and there
might be some other stuff we just don't
know yet but move 11am you so yes yes a
good idea to tell the time yeah if
somebody actually wants to know when
it's happening uh moving on the other
topic we wanted to touch on this week
was all these rumors about force touch
being added to the iphone mm-hmm I'm
still trying to wrap my head around if
this is a good idea or not yeah because
I mean when you think about it it works
on the watch right takes up the whole
screen and apparently on the iphone it
won't do that but it's sort of like and
i have it on my macbook pro here too
it's sort of like an additional button
right like you pushed down and something
else happens but it also reminds me a
lot of just simply tapping and holding
which is its own execution but this is
it's more than that it feels like you're
sort of push
out and so the rumors are and they're
from nine to five neck which is usually
right about this stuff so it sounds
pretty accurate that you can use force
touch on an iphone to say bring up
another menu it's like pushing hold down
and it would bring up a small menu or
say like you're on in safari on a
website you see a link you could force
touch fab the website it'll open and and
like contextual menus like around your
finger like option and say if you wanted
to uh like share something I believe it
was one of the examples so i think
there's plenty of use cases because the
iphone remember as everybody already
knows and just has the home button right
it doesn't have the on on-screen buttons
that android has for a many or return so
i think it's very valuable to have that
if that's what they're planning and you
don't have to you know worry about that
added or loss screen real estate at the
bottom of the phone either well i do you
think it's going to happen yeah i do i
think it seems like there's enough
evidence and now the new panels i think
as of yesterday we saw on for the sack
and time that seemed to have that little
force touch motor on him which would be
the the module that's both the sensor
and gives you that at the forest touch
and we see this similar big copper thing
underneath it and i don't know what it
looks like the apple watch but it just I
think it makes sense to add that like I
was saying for additional menu functions
stuff like that but then there's a cure
like and I agree with that I don't think
it's something like at least right now
where I'd be like oh I need to upgrade
my phone because it has forced touch so
I'm hoping the six pots and stuff in the
sixth s 6s and 6s plus have other
features that are more compelling but we
improved cameras we have a question from
such an be Hall is for such necessary is
it more of a gimmick I personally think
it kind of resides in between the two
yeah you know it's not necessary because
we already have iphones and we use
imaged it we're all just fine with them
right like
it's not necessary but I think it makes
sense and it's not a gimmick in the
sense that it could provide additional
functionality that you don't have right
now yeah show us no no it's not why we
want it exactly I they're gonna have to
come up with a compelling reason you
know I've tried to stay on the main
iphone releases I try to skip the s's
except for you know when I lose my
iphone 5 in England and had Maya 5s yeah
so i am going to be skipping the success
plus but yeah i'm still i'm going to be
interested to see what they do with it
but i'm also going to be like you said
there there's gonna have to be a very
compelling use case for me to ever even
care about force touch like if it works
in Apple maps which nobody uses like I
don't care that then it's a gimmick
right like because i'm not going to open
up Apple Macs maps i still use google
map i use safari so maybe it's useful
there you know other options on the home
screen for example love to see yeah i'm
the same here i'm sorry i'm still google
maps user no matter what device I'm not
yes it's just the the better way to go I
think so we got a lot of questions and
we will start getting through them here
ah from Jasper Rex what battery size do
you think is acceptable for the note 5
um well certainly not 25 I 50 like the
galaxy s sit yeah that's yeah I will
want to see you consider a robot yeah
and I think it's definitely gonna be
more than that but as to the exact
number I just I don't know we'll just
have to wait and see yeah it needs to be
large though yeah um and just so you
know tough for whatever reason we are no
longer seeing you on camera when you
talk
oh that yep we can I can still hear you
though so you're still here it honestly
if I don't have to look at you the
better I mean ah darn it he's back from
Sean the man 34 Todd how's the surface
three attempted to get one for college
to travel around college with my macbook
15 inch maybe a little too good um i
have so i haven't used this sir with
this 3 but i have used this earthly
sauna not sure if it's just an answer
you're looking for surface 3 looks ok
I'm worried about the atom processor not
being powerful enough because I have
another one with a man older atom
processor in it but doesn't run Windows
10 very well now the surface pro 2 30
like a lot it's nice and light my
biggest complaint though and Sean you
know this from working with me in the
mornings I take it to the coffee shop
with me and the keyboard can just drive
me nuts and when I'm typing sometimes it
look off somewhere but a good
capitalization and stuff like that and i
run into really really terrible battery
life when I have chrome on it hour and a
half well oh I know that's common I know
that's like my macbook pro struggles
with chrome too i mean i get like two
and a half hours but it's really hot on
the surface pro 3 but edge is pretty
sweet the new browser in Windows 10
windows 10 runs really well in the
surface for three and again i love how
light is so around campus and stuff it
might be pretty sweet yeah I am I
actually I just say upgraded one of my
parents computers to windows 10 the
other day and I still haven't had time
to really explore edge and see if it
finally will release us of the shackles
of ernet explorer but uh oh yeah it's
better it must saw those cool features
that remind me of like of what you do
with force touch on a map act it's not
controlled by the keyboard but you know
core tonic and like pull in extra data
from the website so if you go to like a
restaurant or something she can be like
oh I have the directions and the times
and all that automatically like she just
scour Cepeda
subsea but that has something you at the
surface pro 3 they honestly Sean if I
was you I would probably wait and see if
there's a surface pro 4 coming soon yeah
and folks I can attest when he's using
that thing in the mornings from a coffee
shop all and and Todd I I'm not I'm not
angry at you for saying these things I'm
just trying to give a testimonial every
it all I hear about is that keyboard
yeah if you're if you're going to pick
up the surface you definitely are going
to want to look at a third-party
keyboard because that seems to be his
biggest issue with his that keyboard in
the way it also gets i know i i've heard
some people love it and they all I think
back tues remember at the announcement
event when he was trying to show how
easy it was using he was trying to prop
it up on his knees hey company I'm a
happily it yeah it does not make sense
for that Mouse no it doesn't make sense
at all moving on from sudheesh Patel and
I hope I got that correct what are your
thoughts on Snapdragon 820 I think it's
a processor and it has a kind in the
name uh I'm excited for it it sounds
like it's gonna have better cameras
better graphic you always move up that
way not launching until next year and I
did that the heat being and those kind
of issues are solved a mom oh Ken had a
lot of problems and I don't think
Qualcomm would want a misstep like that
again but you know I don't know we were
all excited for Snapdragon 810 and Aereo
eight processors and our phones and
loving the Exynos chips and the s6 and
s6 edge so you know hopefully Qualcomm
did a good job with that and and it's
what we lost you there first and Todd
luckily folks that the audio will be
fine because that's recorded locally but
unfortunately for the video show we are
having some technical difficulties today
I every week I get questions on Twitter
and I always forget to look over here at
the Twitter monitor i have so I've been
trying more today to look over here and
we do have one I'm going to take it real
quick because I want people to think
that I actually do read the Twitter
questions from timothy williams do you
think Samsung will include force touch
on their new devices in the future could
we see a force touch note 5 NYC event
now that's an interesting question a lot
of companies do once Apple starts adding
a feature they want to add it but I'm
not really sure about for such I think
people are going to have to go wow this
is a game-changing feature before the
other can throw it in because it's just
an added expense if there's not a really
good use case for it yeah and that comes
back to what I was saying about the lack
of controls on an iPhone you don't have
that back button or the menu button and
that kind of stuff that you do on
Android so I don't think there's that
need on Android and I also don't think
you know we're not even sure well it
seems plausible now that we're going to
see it the iphone 6s the iphone 6s plus
but there's no way it's going to hit the
note 5 tomorrow I don't think Samsung
would would build something that quickly
just because it's been on the Apple
watch in the macbook pro so now I don't
think there's a chance of it being on
the note 5 but I don't see it being
copied now I don't think that is going
to be one that it's going to be copied
from such and behold do any of you guys
use stuff like parallels or boot camp on
your max to use windows and stuff I know
they do a little bit of that out the
irvine office but i don't it i don't
believe you do either Todd no i don't i
just have my windows computers and my
mac appears keep separate if never shall
you farm two different things in one
field good grief ok this is getting
uploaded from Sean the man 34 Todd what
have you returned um I don't think I
return anything I don't think so i'm
trying to think cuz last weekend i
bought something new
and it was a big kayak but I didn't
return that yes okay yeah that would
qualify is it truly a big return ah from
such Mahal is it worth upgrading my
windows 7 and 8 machines to Windows 10
or should I wait I would upgrade the
windows 8 but windows seven is still a
pretty decent operating system yeah it
is and in fact I don't think it's really
disappearing yet either I think some
manufacturers are sticking around with
windows 7 as long as they can I would
double check your hardware though before
you make any moves to Windows 10 because
like i've said i did my netbook which
was running windows 8.1 and it's just
not powerful enough yeah so make sure
okay we got some other questions coming
in here uh from Alexandra mattos do you
hope to see one day the 1+2 be selling
on I'm not sure what that word is in
stores may that force apple or Samsung
to change the prices I think I it could
change a lot of the market um I think it
will happen someday I'm just not sure
when yeah and I don't think Apple and
Samsung are worried about 1 plus
certainly not at all yet I mean this is
a company that sold what one point
something million phones apple sells
tens of millions of them each every
three months so I don't think it's
enough to really squeeze them but I
think that we are going to see Apple and
Samsung change some of their models
because of the markets they're entering
like China and like Latin America and
stuff like that yeah it'll happen at
some point I just I'm not sure when mm
um let's see here well we already kind
of addressed that from John the man 34
will we see any smartwatches tomorrow I
don't know I don't know um I think I'm
it's possible yeah I think it's possible
because we're looking you know there's a
lot of rumors about the gear a 4
forever now and we haven't seen it yet
so well I'm trying to think like when el
squid samsung announced it I don't think
they would hold their own event for the
gear right so it seems really possible
cooking those Todd I saw your message
I'm thrilled uh I'll figure that out
later um nothing horrible folks we're
just having a lot of technical
difficulties today from Justin you'll
say I believe what will be the new
innovation the next gen of phones
opinion also Windows 10 is great window
7 is just a minor hardware hindrance and
Yujin skylake um you know I think I we
discussed this a lot what what could be
the next big thing in phones i mean you
know that oh we added fingerprint
readers hardly anyone uses them but
they're there yeah and the cameras are
getting really great so I want to see
that continue but I don't know it seems
like there's like what is it I mean you
have samsung with PA PMA and qi wireless
charging which is awesome you have us bc
but that's not a huge innovation in the
sense that the manufacturers are doing
it so i don't know i think it's going to
have to come on the software side and
you have to wonder what's going to
change i think maybe the advancement of
these smart assistants like google now
and syria and Cortana will probably be
the largest innovations that will see
moving forward but also un for phones
with continuum i think that's really
cool where you can attach a a display
and have the full Windows 10 nap up here
which is really sweet so maybe we'll see
that progress to where you have you know
iOS apps that can the king blow up and
run OSX on that on some level or let the
Android same idea so that's where I
think we're going more software / yeah I
tend to agree with you uh from Sean the
man 34 heard anything about hololens
release date rumors know
no nothing yet I haven't even played
with one yet but I've talked to
Microsoft I think soon they have this
studio in New York where you can go the
press can for readings and stuff and
then see some of their newest stuff and
they said they're gonna try to get the
hololens there so this thing will be a
little bit yeah I I would love to try it
out from Neal Sampat do you see a point
to one plus is marketing they get a lot
of people excited but never have
products to deliver can they kill any
flagships if they don't show up for the
fight how would you manage it
differently then that's an excellent
point meal and you're right as long as
they continue this system of what
they're doing where yo okay we've got
you know so many more phones we can ship
out today they're not going to they're
not going to be a big force to reckon
with I honestly I think the bigger
question is and one that I always wonder
about you know sometimes you don't want
to be the biggest sometimes you want to
do what you do really really well and
you almost have to wonder if one plus is
taking that tactic where they just want
to control this specific little area of
the market and believe me everyone i am
speaking simply from theory but I almost
wonder if that's where one plus is going
you know there's a lot of money to be
made in niches and so I if they ever
want to take on the flagships yes
they're gonna have to completely change
your model but this model is working for
them so maybe it's better to be a really
big fish in a small pond yeah it seems
potential I mean that in my opinion
phones like the Moto G the alcatel one
touch idol 3 you know the zenfone 2
those kind of devices and I think they
do a good job there but I think fans and
this is clear in some reddit comments
and stuff
like that are like what the heck like I
don't want to wait on this invite system
or like you know if I have to wait
around for this I'm just gonna go get
some other phone and I think they run a
risk there and they should really try to
try to get as many units made as
possible instead of running into like
this year again with the 1+2 we have a
delay in the United States like after
teasing a phone for so long and then I'm
villain you can't do that to your fans
and say oh whoops like we don't have
enough or you're bumped back in line you
didn't get an invite stuff like that so
I feel like maybe you know they should
have more units available make sure
they're not getting delays and satisfy
that that really you know hungry fan
base first yeah exactly no otherwise
they're going to invite those other
phones I need yeah totally i completely
agree with you uh from such an Mahal as
soon as it wants to choose his question
ah disappeared on me I always love it
when that happens ah good ribbing uh oh
there it is well it's actually from Sean
the man 34 that's why I couldn't find it
wireless charging an iphone 6s thoughts
um I don't see it I don't think so I
Apple really likes making you buy cables
yeah it seems to me that's the case and
apple also seems to wait for a
technology to mature and lost everybody
their own like lightning right or
something like that but I cuz i think
wireless charging is great it's it can
be convenient but it's also still very
slow it's getting faster and I wonder if
Apple's just going to wait for it to
become you know as fast as a cable
charging or close to it before they do
it I don't know I love what Samsung's
done though with PMA and she I think
that's the way to go you know like
support both and then you're good uh
Neil Sam part brought it up something or
Sam pet that brought something I had
forgot about that one plus head said
they did announce they expect to be top
three smartphone sellers and
five years so I think they want to be
big um they can think that only wants a
lot happen yeah it's not gonna happen
there's no way they will well actually
now because you can in a way and show me
ya know but I don't think there's any
way they can make a copy of knocking us
big guys out no I there's no way they're
going to take down Apple there's no way
they're going to take down Samsung HTC
at the moment is out of the running
blackberries out of the running I don't
care yes Blackberry Android phone it's
probably going to happen but it's not
going to make them a top three again and
then you gotta deal with the companies
like show me an OA that are dominating
China so I don't know and one comes in
guys well qualies here but you look at
shiomi wants enter the u.s. to I
thinking I just don't see it especially
because you have to consider these guys
are trying to get the best parts and
they have to be able to afford them
eventually like if you if you want to
become a talk to you got to compete with
those guys with parts too and I think
that's why you see HTC sort of struggle
with their camera mom on tools getting
the best ones that I think you know
Samsung and Apple are able to scoop up
at scale so I don't know how they're
going to get over that boundary teether
especially if they can't even fill
orders right now for a further like fan
base yeah it's a very odd situation from
Justin you'll say the Google alphabet
announcement thoughts smart or not I
think people are going to be confused
yeah I mean Google is going to be the
Google you know as of right now right
like it's but it's also now under the
umbrella of a company named alphabet
sundar pokai is now the CEO it's just
it's different and I think we see
Project X i guess the X labs are now
under alphabet not google so let the
wait and see like how this all unfolds
but to me it was just a surprise like
the other day what the heck just
happened yeah that was
so bizarre so does art I really don't
have a debate I people are just still
going to call it all Google yeah I think
so too and yeah ticker symbol symbol
when they're trading is still in Google
yeah from Neil sampad if Apple has to
maintain their lure what's the next big
thing we need to see from them what do
you expect watches were a bust TV vr I
know it's big but what do you expect the
first thing I would say is we don't know
that the watch is a bust and i'm not
sure i would say to watch is a bus
because a watery at like estimates on
the low end of 3 million in sales that's
better than any other SmartWatch it's
sold yet so yeah I'm not sure it's a box
i think feature software updates you get
more apps and it'll probably do pretty
well yeah i know i would say overall the
smart watch market is kind of a bust but
as sales go though as far as we can tell
the Apple watches the biggest selling
SmartWatch that being said from there
though I don't know what they're going
to do next I think the TV's dead I don't
think we're ever going to see the TV
well I think we'll see the new Apple TV
well yeah hey I'm sorry I'm speaking TV
set right yeah yeah it doesn't seem to
bother you TV said I don't think it's
going to have an apple TV little box yes
that that's definitely being refreshed
it's just a question of when since how
many times have we gone through rumor
cycles on it right vr we know they're
hiring some people but Apple experiments
with things every day you know we also
know they've hired people related to
cars we haven't seen anything official
on that we don't know we ever will I
don't know I don't know where Apple's
going to go next my guess is the ones
that and I could be totally wrong but
that Apple is working just sort of
change these industries by making
smaller things so like the Apple TV set
and the streaming service could change
TV industry the way you know some TV and
stuff is and I
think with cars maybe they're working on
parts of cars or or aspects that can be
applied to the auto industry as a whole
maybe not their own car I don't know
another question coming in from Twitter
from and I can't see your full name let
me give me a second here from the
electric MJ what happened to google
glass Google glass from what we're
hearing they have shipped out a new
model to businesses it's not being
handled like the Explorer edition was
and so we're we're hearing rumors that
there is a second version out there yeah
and then we're kind of waiting for the
new consumer version but I don't know
that that's on there on the immediate
horizon I think we'll have to wait a bit
longer yeah uh from Richard hendren we
addressed this a couple weeks ago do you
think it was a good decision for 1 plus
to exclude NFC from the 1+2 no no I
think that was silly I just finished our
moto g review and I have it right here
and I still love the phone but one of
the things I don't like about it is it
doesn't have NFC because i use it for
small things like pairing with a
bluetooth speaker i have everyone right
here that I you know you just tap it
boom you're playing music and when you
don't have that it's kind of just like
one of those things are like oh I wish I
did and again with Android pay
commenting and stuff like that you know
Google Wallet use case now you can't do
that so kind of a bummer not really a
flagship killer it doesn't have flagship
features is my opinion uh just got asked
a question by timothy williams is the
video being uploaded to YouTube actually
it's automatically archived on the show
finishes uh let's see here I've got
questions out coming in on multiple
screens since I'm actually remembering
to look over at Twitter for those that
wonder why I keep going like this that's
because Twitter is on a second monitor
to my right from saha Raja what would
you like to see in the next Nexus and
well Google come out with their own
SmartWatch um what would I seen the next
I have given the see how fingerprint
readers work with Android and built into
the system so if I can use it sort of
the way Apple pay is built and their
touch ID which with Apple pay so if I
can use the fingerprint reader to make
purchases in google play and stuff like
that it seems plausible I think that's
what I want to see in terms of hardware
it sounds like you're going to get
quality cheese plays the rumors Chloe's
gonna have the you know a metal pipe
phone and maybe even LG's but really I
just want the flagship specs and
hopefully an affordable slightly
affordable prices I also want to see
project fights supported by boat and ice
that should happen in people's going to
push that because night get to celebrity
bones for that at least yeah I mean
every year the Nexus grabs my attention
but it's always too expensive for what I
want to pay yeah yeah I maybe someday
I'll be able to although supposedly the
rumors are coming out with a cheaper
model this year what I'll do one is now
so I don't know well we'll see from
Justin you'll say with Google coming to
all the areas of utilities in
entertainment what do you expect google
drop in next car check car check TV
check cellular check isp fiber check
space robot invasions service of some
kind actually if you go to google and
you and do view page source you will
actually see there is a killer robots
text that protects Sergey Brin and Larry
Page so the robot invasion is a
possibility ah I don't know a google is
one of those companies that at any
moment you don't know what they're going
to do next and all the sudden its just
oh hey we decided to work on this yeah
okay yeah I don't know I don't know I I
want to say you know the modular
smartphones become
legitimate whatever happened in the
Puerto Rico soft launch I don't know I
don't know and the the other thing I
mean I think they also really
desperately want to get the autonomous
cars on the road yeah you know it eat
there on the road for testing but on the
road as in hey we can all drive one or
not drive one right rider yeah so all
