two microsoft retail stores in the world
right now one in Scottsdale Arizona and
one in the Mission Viejo mall in
Southern California which happens to be
about 20 minutes away from me
so I took the trip there yesterday and
walked around the store and filmed I was
able to get a sense of what the store
looked like and what it was about I was
able to do an interview with employees
oh they wouldn't go on camera and really
get a sense of what it felt like to be
at a Microsoft store and the experience
they were going for and as you'll see in
the video the experience is definitely
familiar and recalls a certain other
retail experience so check out the video
and enjoy the tour of the Microsoft
Store
with our banners and advertisements for
those absolutely everywhere now open
let's go check it out all right so here
we are we're at the the Microsoft Store
take a look and see how it compares to
its Apple and what the retail experience
is like let's go ahead and walk in and
start check it out you can see from the
outside it looks very similar very glass
things are sort of wide open so go ahead
and walk in and check it out
got displays of a ton of different
computers from all different
manufacturers of course you got Windows
7 displays laptops
got a ton of software in the back
kind of hunt laptops out they've got a
few Microsoft Surface displays we'll
take a look at they've got some windows
phone windows mobile 6.5 display set up
huge Xbox is play in the back
everybody's dressed in different colors
all the employees which is pretty unique
Windows 7 is very heavily on display
here they've got an Xbox setup where you
can write a play and check things out
they've got a whole display just for
just for netbooks right there you can
see some of the kids on it ton of
different laptops take a look some of
the ones they have here here's a Sony
next to an Acer really just there's a
lot of different variety here under
display it's here's some more Xbox
connectivity it's like they have people
dressed in green that are just meant for
Xbox
some people here playing at some gaming
stations with these flat panel TVs that
are sort of ingrained in the wall
which is kind of cool looks looks really
neat it's a very neat approach I got
some boxing and some Madden going on
down there they got some DJ Hero right
there just kind of neat ton of games and
all the different consoles
those are keep walking around
there's all the the netbook explain
some of the HP all-in-one touchscreens
on this Microsoft Surface displays of
course fun more Xbox stuff here is the
Xbox 360 limited edition modern warfare
2 with its phone of modern warfare games
shouldn't just come here to pick up the
game instead of bothering with
pre-orders but the story is absolutely
packed you can see against the wall
they've got these sort of screen TVs
there all the way around that are
showing images you can see it better
from this side and they have the video
game sort of embedded into those it's a
pretty cool experience so far everybody
seems really happy it's a very upbeat
the employees are very happy and a beat
really eager to answer any questions and
talk about Windows 7 it see things right
I'm moving around over there they also
have some displays for kids with
some Dell computers that got out here to
the Dell studios ton of accessories
these little sections right here which
are interactive so you can touch that
local computer and it shows up right
there subscribe here is learning about
Microsoft Office they've got sort of
their version of the the Genius Bar in
the back where they have classes and
sort of show things up on that screen
you can learn all about the Windows
program they've got their actual Genius
Bar here where look just like a bar you
bring up your questions and you ask it
all the retail guys are using this these
tablets here to sell yourself and answer
questions ton of Microsoft Surface
displays a lot of laptops are are the
big attractions here
hope you guys enjoyed this tour of the
Microsoft Store I'm gonna keep walking
around and see what things look like
anyway hope you guys go ahead now let's
see the next video so let's actually go
look at one of the Microsoft Surface
displays here at the Microsoft Store
there are a ton of options here that you
can take a look at they got some games
chess but what I want to show you right
now for a quick demonstration is what
you sort of always see people
demonstrate with surface and that's
pictures you open this up and you've got
a ton of pictures here and if I had a
they're saying a infrared device you put
it down and it will take the pictures
off so take one of the images here go
ahead and turn it and of course this
multi-touch I'm using one hand but you
can zoom in you can move it around test
it out so is on the other side of the
table I wanted to show its own I could
spin it another lecture and just push it
off them take a look at you move around
you can take a look at all different
photos shrink this down
and open up other ones and move it off
to the side go ahead and hit the button
down there I get back to the menu time
different slope you can check out so
there's a concierge service would take a
look at that
I think that pulls up maps of the mall
information we're at and terribly
exciting to see here I don't think it's
more information on Microsoft Surface it
doesn't to be a very interesting sort of
display it's quite large you guys can
see down there it's a it's a big table
but of course it is multi-touch so you
can see Microsoft store lives and there
are several these set up all around and
people seem to really be enjoying it
there are a bunch of kids playing games
it seems like a very immersive way to
learn about the store and more
importantly learn about Microsoft
product line so there's some more
section my first time ever seeing
surface and it's a very impressive
experience so far it does look a little
washed out screen ones me because
brightness is turned down not sure but
it is very impressive take a look at
some of the other
so I just finished interview with one of
the store employees here and learned
about the system they have in place here
take a look this is all the software
that they have out on display in the
store and being a software company you
know figure Microsoft has much more so
I've got this system right here where
you can recommend it and learn gift
ideas the most popular and actually pull
up information right up there and you
can browse all their software and I
think they've got over 400 here and you
can actually buy it right from this
machine they've got a printer in the
back that actually takes the disk burns
and it labels it seals it and gives you
a license key right here all done right
from this machine they say it'll take
about ten minutes to buy anything that
they have and they give you a full
retail packaging the Dave going package
right in right in the back which is a
very sort of neat experience as I'm
moving my finger here and touching
different things let's see it's changing
up there as well which is which is
pretty neat and it's actually right turn
it into the wall there's a little bit of
an outline of a computer display there
and you can learn all about different
items that they're offering here at the
the Microsoft Store so one of the other
interesting things that they're offering
here at the Microsoft Store it's a
skinning of devices so you've got an
Xbox 360 controller skin with some
Mickey Mouse stuff so what you can do is
you can use some pictures that I already
have stored here or any image that you
want you upload to Facebook they pull it
off of Facebook and they print you a
full 3m sort of offset to go on your
Xbox so they'll put it on here for you
for a Bluetooth 30 bucks you can skin
your own your own Zune your laptop
really anything you want they could skin
and put on here for you and if you want
to do it yourself you certainly can and
we never get sick of a just peel it off
if you come back and they will put on
another one
and xbox over there at the family
portrait to put on it there a lot of
really cool features near there showing
sort of the connectivity between Windows
7 soon and so here I am with the Dell
Adamo and one interesting thing about
the products here in the the Microsoft
Store is that they were bloatware free
Microsoft took all of the garbage we're
off of them so I'm looking here at the
Dell Adamo this is not the abdominal XPS
this is just a regular Adamo I have not
seen one of these before I thought I'd
give you guys a sort of quick view of
what it looks like it's pretty spacious
keyboard a nice lash track head it is a
very thin as you can see it's a little
bit on the heavy side you can get the
sort of seen aspect right there no ports
on the side and certainly no obstacle
Drive but all the ports are actually in
the back which is pretty neat it's got a
few USB ports an HDMI out we've got that
white look it is it is very cool it's a
very impressive experience here so far
to Microsoft Store the employees have
been very helpful and eager to to give
information back to these computers are
coming at down the bloatware really
shows that maybe Microsoft is getting
sort of the new generation and they
understand either consumer a little
better than perhaps they have in the
past the last interesting things about
the computers here at the Microsoft
stores actually don't have those windows
stickers and labels that you see on all
other laptops that you buy Microsoft
actually aside they didn't want to put
those on any of those computers sold in
or actually makes them look a lot so
cleaner so we're looking at the Adamo
again very very nice the computers are
really select people really seem happy
and content with the store it's about
two o'clock in the afternoon right now
and it's not that business there plenty
of people a lot of people here are
asking me for versus decent health hope
you guys enjoyed the walkthrough of the
Microsoft Store it's definitely
reminiscent of the Apple experience but
certainly if you're not an Apple fan or
not into the Mac the Microsoft Store
experience it is quite good you're
getting a lot of exposure to different
computers the fact that all of the
laptops and desktops are bloatware free
and they're without those silly stickers
and Microsoft labeling and branding is
really nice one thing that I didn't get
on camera is every time somebody buys a
computer they walk out the store all the
employees clap no matter what color
shirt they're wearing or what they're
doing or if they don't being a customer
they all clap which is a little bit
weird to say that people just look
embarrassed they are walking out with
computers all the computers that people
are buying to so if you're buying like a
Sony for example does it come in a Sony
box it comes in a white box with the big
Microsoft Store logo on top of it with a
black handle very similar to what you'd
see on a MacBook Pro for example that
was quite interesting to see the
employees were really excited about the
store they're excited about the
opportunity to be there you know
Microsoft has their own sort of version
of 1 to 1 in their own version of Apple
care that certainly you can get at the
stores it sort of felt like bizarro
Apple store and certainly that was
probably what Microsoft was going for I
know it's a different retail chain but
it's hard to walk into a Microsoft Store
or not think of Apple they took some of
the best parts of the Apple store and a
lot of ways improved upon it certainly
that technology to have on the wall the
screens that you saw that people were
playing the Xbox on it was very cool to
me for a extremely immersive experience
and that machine that printed the the
software that you wanted was quite fun
the fact that you can label and
customize your Xbox your Zune gadgets I
was pretty neat as well so overall I
can't wait very impressed with the
Microsoft Store if you guys are near you
know those two look
I highly recommend you go and check them
out I think it's something that you'll
enjoy even if you're not a Microsoft fan
or a Windows 7 fan it just really neat
to see one thing that I did over here
the employees saying I thought this was
interesting was that they said we had
everyone with Windows XP and we lost
them with Vista and we're trying to get
them back with Windows 7 so I wonder if
that is Microsoft's for a philosophy
they obviously knew that Vista wasn't a
success they want it to be you could see
by the short retail life and then trying
to win back I think the consumers minds
and hearts with Windows 7 certainly the
most people never left Windows XP
service do they have a vast market share
but they're trying to push the upgrade 2
to 7 I think is a fantastic operating
system so guys I hope you enjoy and I'll
