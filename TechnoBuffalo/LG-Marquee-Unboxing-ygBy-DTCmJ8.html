TechnoBuffalo here at that I'm blocking
for you of the LG Mark II it's a mid to
high range Android smartphone for
Sprint's let's go ahead and see if
there's something good written on the
marquee alright so here is the LG Mark
II it's going to take a quick look at
the box
typical sprint you got a picture of a
dude and yellow shirt with yellow socks
looking really happy playing with this
phone there's a picture of the phone
these are life-size drawn to scale so
the phone is actually about 17 feet tall
this guy is very tiny blocked off some
information there's and stuff on the box
telling you about what's in it but we're
gonna see that in a minute
LG Mark II and some more LG Marty
business here great let's go ahead and
dig it open hopefully a little guy is
not included in the box here is the LG
Mark II just sitting there chillin in
its cardboard house I'll go ahead and
make it homeless push it off to the side
this one is extremely light I wonder if
the batteries in there got in here a
micro SD SD card adapter not sure if
that would just include in our review
unit this was sent to us from Sprint or
if maybe there's something else going on
that maybe you're gonna get that in your
box as well we've got some books yay
getting started guides if you want to
recycle your old phone Sprint's really
good about providing an envelope to do
so I encourage you guys to recycle your
old phones the batteries inside the old
devices can be really hazardous to the
landfills we've got micro USB cord and
we've got the charging cord or cable
rather for the wall adapter is what I'm
looking for
plugs in they do this thing out of the
plastic I don't work alright so the
batteries in here pretty impressive
actually how like this phone is let me
do a little a little zooming in action
here for you let's take a look at the
phone itself hey here's the phone itself
alright let me go ahead and peel off the
plastic here I know you guys love
looking at those displays we have it on
the back we do if we will peel this off
as well
come here plastic
let's go ahead and power this sucker on
and hopefully it's got enough juice to
start working and I can run you through
this specs because there's actually a
lot to what's like about the phone
alright so here is the lg Marquis it has
a 4-inch ultra bright Nova display of
course that's measured diagonally it's
got a resolution of 480 by 800 so that's
WVGA see it doing this whole startup
business they're being powered by a 1
gigahertz single core processor 512
megabytes of RAM on the back side it's
got a 5 megapixel camera with autofocus
and LED flash that's not the only
cameras guys rockin it's got a 2
megapixel shooter on front living right
there see it comes with the funky
background evidently pre-installed on
here as well uh 2 gigabyte microSD cards
pre-installed with 1500 milliamp hour
battery which must weigh 0.0 pounds this
one is extremely light the whole thing
is going to waste 3.95 ounces
alright so there's a phone get it kicked
up there and let's do a quick tour of
the device power back on
ok on the left hand side the volume
rocker up and down got a hard button for
launching the camera ever you want that
hard button to launch on the right hand
side nothing you get nice straight lines
there bottom microphone on the top
there's where the charging ports going
to be located under a door hate doors
but that one just slides off to the side
you can plug it in you've got your power
and lock but on the upper right hand
corner which is my favorite position to
have those that's my favorite position
and we've got a 3.5 millimeter headset
jack on the back it's hard plastic very
sort of reflective looking sort of
space-age if you can see me somewhere I
get my face in there boom there I am hi
this is me talking to you in a phone's
reflection on a camera alright it's
Monday morning what do you watch me you
guys alright so let's go ahead and power
this thing on let's take a look at
what's powering it jump right into
settings it looks like a relatively
unskilled version of Android which is
kind of nice to see of LG a demanding in
here
looks like pretty native need of
gingerbread so let's double check that
let's jump into settings
you also have support for Sprint's IDs
you can switch different IDs but
essentially like themes for the phone
you know nothing overly fancy there I'll
go ahead and scroll down to the bottom
about phone and we are running Android
2.3.4 right there pretty decently
responsive so far I've got four
capacitive buttons across the bottom
typical ones it expects home
you've got your menu button your back
and your search anything else here is
sort of as it should be nothing else
overly exciting here going on I am John
Retton German TechnoBuffalo and this
looks to be a pretty good option
actually if you are in the market for a
mid to high range phone you don't want
to check prices online because it's
changed all the time at least right now
this is 100 bucks on a two-year contract
if you want a thin light phone that can
do Android and hopefully do Android
pretty well you guys can go ahead and
pick this up today from Sprint stay
tuned for a full review here of the LG
marque I'm John Retton or who
TechnoBuffalo and I like scrolling
through screens</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
