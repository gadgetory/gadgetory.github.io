to you by full sail university what's up
everyone welcome back to their pisode of
rettinger rants I'm your host Jon
renders the show where I rant them
something that is going on in the world
of technology up this week it was super
easy to pick a topic amazon prime air
freakin robot octocopter airplanes are
gonna be delivering packages to your
doorsteps sometime in the future or at
least that's what amazon i want you to
think let's talk about it so if you
didn't see the video back spread goes
like this Jeff Bezos who started and now
runs amazon said that Amazon's gonna
have this crazy new thing coming out he
said soon called amazon prime air where
essentially drones deliver your package
the idea is if you live within 10 miles
of an amazon distribution center and you
deliver and ask for a package rather
that's five pounds or less a drone can
deliver it to your door i think of
something like an AR drone with the
package dangling from it they did a
whole video showing it going through a
conveyor belt dropping it into this
little yellow plastic almost like
Tupperware thing and the drone just
picks it up and takes off and then
returns back it is absolutely crazy the
Internet has been a blaze so I feel two
ways about it first holy crap that's
awesome we are in the future right now
on the other side people were like it's
crazy we're gonna die Skynet his gun
sentience and drones are gonna be
falling out of the sky and dry package
on people's cars and running out of
battery and causing accidents and the
world is gonna end and what am I gonna
tell my children this is a terrible
terrible thing so before anybody gets
too excited first I would say the
chances of this actually coming to
market are between 0 and next 20 clear a
few reasons first FAA approval it is a
flying frickin thing in the sky they
gotta get FAA approval for all these
things thought that's going to happen
number two I know Amazon's also our
logistics you can order things up until
late at night and it shows up the next
day they're probably the best in the
world look logistics but getting drones
deliver packages and then come back too
much for him to handle how do you deal
with wind how do you deal with trees in
the way had
with malfunctions just a liability alone
and be crazy what if the drone
malfunctions and drops the package on a
car I don't think we're ever ever ever
going to see this and then is it the
same me too UPS is like a us here we
also love drones and robots we are going
to have them deliver to you as well so
taking away the loss of human labor
which is always a thing but companies
have a right to try and it'll lower
their overhead increase of profit their
companies there for profit they're not
nonprofits or charity so I can order get
past that but this is never ever ever
going to happen but knowing that it's
never gonna happen holy crap it's super
cool to actually see the drone flies
deliver package on the doorstep and pick
up and fly away I would just like to see
it in action just to live in a world
where like robots deliver stuff that
would really make me feel like you're
just in the future you know what's neck
you didn't have a whole mill and a meal
and a pill form it's like living in the
Jetsons I want Rosie and I want Rosie to
clean my house I imagine the iRobot
Rosie is probably coming soon enough I
know probably eighty percent of you were
looking at me like yes I don't remember
that Pokemon but needless to say the
future is coming and it's coming pretty
fast and I'm kind of excited to see it
but don't get too excited on amazon
prime air think of a better chance of
seeing amazon prime horseback amazon
prime hoverboard would be kind of cool
gets delivered on a hoverboard none of
its gonna happen so don't get too
excited don't get you angry don't feel
too passionate about it one way I'd
rather go back to fighting about Apple
versus Android or Xbox vs ps4 I'm gonna
exhale deep breath relax for a minute
