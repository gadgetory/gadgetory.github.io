technobuffalo here and i want to show
you guys one of the coolest features of
blackberry 10 then the camera it's
called Timeship essentially what it lets
you do is take a picture of one person
or multiple people and if they blink or
tilt her head the wrong way it takes
several pictures in a few milliseconds
and you can pick the best one and put it
in so you always get that best shot no
more closed eyes shots taking shots of
kids or people that are looking directly
in the sunlight you can get that perfect
picture it's going to take a look all
right so to use the time should feature
you just launch the camera go ahead and
launch it right there then you get three
icons across the top the one on the left
of the face is time shift the one in the
middle is of course camcorder than your
standard camera so we'll keep it on time
shift we use Roy right here as our test
subject to take a picture or focus it's
the same you just tap the screen so one
two three so it's snapped a few pictures
here lets me know that that is Royce
face i'll go ahead and tap on it and
pulls up this giant picture of mr. Choi
I can final where he looks less shocked
and smiley so that one looks pretty good
we'll go ahead and tap that and then
there it shows up and it looks freaking
pretty solid picture there's no sort of
patching that you would see if you go
ahead and open up again let's pick a
weird one or Roy boom Roy's eyes closed
go ahead and use that and then there you
go eyes are closed hit select the rest
of the pictures are deleted and you're
left just that one that you've gone it
works pretty well if you have more than
one person in there it'll work with two
we did try it with Lucy though and it
won't work with dog faces it's a really
neat feature and I think one of the main
selling points for blackberry 10 so if
you're interested in picking up a
blackberry 10 device either the z10 here
the q10 coming it's definitely a pretty
compelling feature just work seamlessly
I hope you guys enjoyed i'm jon
