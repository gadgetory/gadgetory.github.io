TechnoBuffalo here an iphone on verizon
is mythical as a unicorn at this point
but we may finally leave you one step
closer to seeing the horn horse so
bloomberg yesterday reported from two
independent sources at an iphone is
coming to verizon wireless in January
2011 which coincides rather perfectly
both write-ins announcement of them
turning on their 4g network or LTE so
what does this mean well it means we
actually might see an iphone with a
fourth generation wireless technology in
it verizon said they're going to be
start selling their 4g handsets come
black friday which the day after
thanksgiving and sort of have the
network turned on around the holiday
season now holiday season is actually a
time when most people buy cell phones
giving out gifts that are generally cell
phones people are signing new contracts
so it does seem a bit odd that a phone
to be announced in January while I sort
of right after a big buying period so I
would assume that if the phone is coming
in January it'll be announced prior to
the holiday shopping season which is
great news and not that far away so
let's talk a bit about LTE so facilities
that don't know Verizon and Sprint use
the wireless technology called CDMA for
the current evdo and voice and data
technologies 18t t-mobile and a lot of
the other global standards have been
called GSM the phones that have a city
card our gsm phones so verizon's fourth
generation LTE technology is actually
gsm-based so there'd be a lot of
similarities for what they would have
with an AT&amp;amp;T iphone now AT&amp;amp;T is fourth
generation technology is also LTE which
is of course gsm-based as well so if we
sort of open the door to maybe a fourth
generation technology phone on both AT&amp;amp;T
and Verizon and here's where things get
a bit tricky because it can't be the
same phone verizon is claimed that they
are going to still be using their older
cdma network for voice calls and the LTE
oh just before data there still ugly
have to be two radios in this alleged
verizon iphone whereas if there was a
fourth generation AT&amp;amp;T phone it could be
still to gsm technology so it's still
have to be two radios LTE and
traditional sort of
ugh type radio' in there so sort of
interesting or not looking at the same
phone on multiple carriers that to be a
bit of a bit of a variance but I do you
think choice is good and choice is good
for consumers to pick whether or not
which carrier they'd like to be with
whether you want to go to big red or
stay with AT&amp;amp;T big red ring verizon
consumer choice is always a nice thing
so the day of reckoning I finally be
here we may have sort of a choice for
carriers it would be able to pick where
you get the best service and which
carrier and data plan and prices high
student you the best so what do you
think about the iphone for verizon in
january two thousand eleven already
upset that you bought an iphone 4 are
you waiting to upgrade are you going to
wait and see what happens or if you had
enough of these rumors you don't care
anymore it's never going to happen it's
just like seeing a unicorn anyway guys
i'm jon rettinger from TechnoBuffalo and
i'll see the next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
