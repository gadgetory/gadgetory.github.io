to give you an overview of the samsung
behold for t-mobile service and this is
really an overview of all Samsung
devices using this TouchWiz widget based
interface so that's the Samsung Eternity
the omnia ton of different devices that
use the same interface let me go ahead
and show you here so this Samsung is not
running a smartphone OS it's just
running on Samsung proprietary operating
system but it does have the widgets that
are common amongst all TouchWiz devices
let me show you first thing you'll
notice is there's a little arrow up in
the upper left hand corner if you touch
that it pulls out a list of little
widgets and you can simply scroll
through this whole list to find the
widgets that you like so I'll go through
each one with you to show you what they
are so for example right here on the
home screen I've got a t-mobile my faves
you have the widget on the home screen
you can select it with your finger and
move it around and if you don't want it
you drag it right back into the bar you
can choose which widgets are shown you
can customize them in the settings menu
I'll show you in a minute
but I'll walk you through real quickly
what your widget choices are so the
first thing you have is this globe drag
it out to the home screen that globe
gives you opens up the browser
and essentially all that globe does is
launch your browser which I'll get to in
just a minute
exit so the next widget that you have is
a little music note and not surprisingly
controls your music functions so we'll
drag both of these back next one you saw
is a t-mobile my faves that's pretty
standard fare for most t-mobile phones
they'll envelope right there take you
right to your messages next one I am
which I know a lot of folks are
interested in using this as a messaging
device it is a very capable messenger
device coming pre-loaded with a I am ICQ
Windows Live and Yahoo messengers go
ahead and drag both of those back
there's a tips which will give you tips
for the device there's a magnifying
glass search those that use Mac OS 10
are familiar with it just a search grab
that bent put this one out here my
account allows you take you to the web
and give you all information for your
t-mobile account it really is quite
handy this one right below you guys have
probably seen quite a bit that is
TeleNav this is a GPS equipped phone so
it'll give you turn by turn directions
and it's fully Java based this little
guy right here with the arrows coming
out as you can hear by the robotic voice
and watch his voice command and the
voice command is actually fantastic you
can call number you can look up you can
check your minutes very handy this
little guy here is a calendar obviously
little guy to control your Bluetooth
tell you what day it is compose a
message that little envelope with a pen
that one launches all your games this
one right here
takes you right to your voicemail and
this is a handy little clock and as you
can set for world time so if your family
isn't another times under friends in
another time zone you can keep track of
where they are this is one that's very
you so it will keep track of all your
birthday's coming
and the last one that we have available
are your upcoming events you can drag
those back and you can put as many
widgets as you want on your home screen
or as many as you can fit and you can
move them around and customize them so I
promised I'd show you what the widget
interface looks in the menu so let me
show you that you go to menu hit
settings you notice this is all
touchscreen base and as I hits the menu
options I'm getting a little bit of
haptic feedback which actually is a very
responsive widget and you can see there
all right there everything that just
right through with you and you can see
it's flick scrolling as well with a very
accurate physics engine so meaning when
I touch it it Scrolls down and comes
back up so let's go back to the main
screen let me show you what the web
browser looks like so I'll go ahead and
hit web and this is a full HTML capable
web browser so I've got YouTube queued
up right here it does take you to the
mobile version of YouTube and I don't
want the questions that I got a lot on
this phone is can you watch youtube
videos so let me show you how to do it
quickly the answer is yes so here we got
President Obama's speech from last night
I'll go ahead and click that and I'm
just over a 3G network this is not a
Wi-Fi equipped phone watch video and I
want just a proprietary staying song
media player you can see loading right
there
queues up in landscape and start to play
you can make a little bit bigger make a
little bit smaller depending control
your volume the quality is not the best
it's good enough it's watchable it's
listenable but you're not gonna get HD
resolution out here and just accept the
quality is not gonna be the best but it
is nice to be able to watch YouTube
videos go ahead and exit out of here hey
is it browser yes so seeing as this
doesn't have a keyboard most people are
gonna want to know how is the software
keyboard so let me go ahead and show you
guys exactly what the software keyboard
looks like I'll take advantage of the
widget to create a message tap here to
start typing
you notice that you get a landscape
keyboard this also has an accelerometer
built-in so when you rotate it you get
your standard t9 keyboard I prefer the
QWERTY and this is actually a very
accurate QWERTY keyboard as you start
typing it pulls off the letters to the
side actually quite nicely and easily so
you can see what you're typing and
actually is quite accurate if you notice
that as I go it starts auto correcting
and picking on picking words for me
which is really nice as you get space it
will pick the word that you use really
is a nice handy feature and the keyboard
is very usable one of the more usable
soft keyboards that I've seen so bass is
just a real quick software overview like
that here there we go
the Samsung behold for t-mobile hope you
enjoy it and stay tuned for a full
