John render from TechnoBuffalo here I
want to give you a hectic comparison of
the two biggest smartphone Goliath on
the market right now
in one corner we have Sprint's Evo 4G
and on the other we have the
just-released
iPhone 4 for AT&amp;amp;T Wireless both of these
things pack a ton of punch and a lot of
the same features let's put these things
together head-to-head and declare a
winner today we're gonna cover display
processor storage camera connectivity
browser battery speed text entry and
some customization so let's go ahead and
jump right in here and talk about the
display that's one of the things that
you always look at the iPhone 4 you hear
about the Retina display and you look at
the huge screen on the Evo 4G display
plays a very prominent role in the
marketing and sales of both of these
devices so the iPhone 4 is a 3.5 inch
screen with the resolution of 960 by 480
the LCD display quadruples the amount
from the last generation to six hundred
and fourteen thousand four hundred so
it's got more pixels on a smaller screen
the Evo's got a 4.3 inch screen the
resolution of 480 by 800 pixel pixels
and it's pixel count is about 384 so for
a smaller screen the iPhone fours Retina
display far outshines the larger screen
on the Evo 4 as far as picture quality
sharpness and pixel density so despite
the larger size of the Evo 4G the better
screen still goes to the iPhone 4 I mean
you look at text and you look at videos
and pictures you can notice that the
screen is much sharper and I sort of see
that as we go along with the tests so
round 1 is going to the iPhone 4 so
let's talk about start of the size and
display how big a pocket ball they are
the iPhone 4 is point three seven inches
thick and see it right there and weight
is about four point eight ounces on the
other hand the Evo 4G is about half an
inch thick and weighs six point two axes
so a bit heavier the Evo 4G is just on
the very outside of pocket ability you
certainly can't fit it in a pocket but
it's a little bit bigger than what you
might like yeah that's gonna sort of a
more perfect size to fit in but this
one's going to be personal preference
not which one you prefer so I'm gonna
make this one be a draw if you get any
Evo 4G you know you're getting something
you know you're getting a bigger phone
you gotta check it make sure it's gonna
fit in your pocket the iPhone 4 odds are
just going to work alright so let's talk
about processor next the HTC EVO 4G uses
the one gigahertz Snapdragon processor
book like Qualcomm sort of it all the
rage in the smartphone world right now
the processor in the iPhone is Apple's
a4 system-on-a-chip the same processor
that's being used in the iPad I'll be a
public lock down a little bit and as
we'll see speed for speed these things
are very comparable so this processor is
a draw these are both power sipping very
capable processors that handle
multitasking video really everything
that you throw at it with a great
alacrity means to handle it very well
so let's talking about storage next
because well I'll talk about here in a
storage apartment the least expensive
option is going to be the iPhone 4 so
the least expensive iPhone 4 they need
16 gigabytes of storage and to be up to
32 for an extra hundred dollars so $300
you get 32 gigabytes of storage from
from Apple or AT&amp;amp;T the Evo comes with a
gigabyte card expandable up to 32 but an
extra cartons can go up to 32 all the
way is gonna cost you about $200 so for
$200 from Sprint and $20 for an SD card
you are gonna be paying about $400 $100
more than what you pay for the same
storage on the iPhone for aliyah or that
clerk will be removable and I'm sure
that price will drop but right now you
are paying a bit more for storage on the
Evo this one here though I'm gonna call
a draw because you might like removable
storage or you might not sex again is
going to be a personal preference thing
so let's jump over to connectivity
because both of these things are stacked
with connectivity options the iPhone 4
for example has 3G speeds which capable
of 600 kilobits per second to 1.7
megabits per second it does have Wi-Fi
including B G and n the Eva on the other
hand has 4G capable if you're in a 4G
network which can do speeds not an
average from 3 to 6 megabits per second
it can do a video call without
why five whereas the three gef are
suiting the for Annie's Wi-Fi to use
FaceTime can also be used as a Wi-Fi
hotspot which is which is pretty cool so
a few extra features here including this
and a 4G which is a biggie
this edge goes to the Evo so I'm gonna
get some hands-on stuff guys in just a
minute let's talk about battery life
since things are gonna have to be used
and they're powering a lot of stuff
iPhone 4 gonna get about 7 hours a 3G
talktime about 14 hours of 2g talktime
about 300 hours of standby six hours of
3G internet 10 hours which is Wi-Fi
internet 10 hours of video playback 240
hours of audio playback those numbers
are actually very similar to what you're
gonna get on the Evo and so similar in
fact that it's gonna depend on what
brightness your levels actually it's
Kermit the winner here
the iPhone 4 does have a little bit
larger battery so your plugin get a tad
bit longer battery life but nothing
noticeable enough to declare a clear
winner here
so battery life we're going to go with a
tie so now let's jump into browser I
knew a lot of my work on the mobile web
I assume that you guys probably do as
well and rely on it very heavily so
let's check how the mobile web
experience is for both these devices I'm
gonna go ahead and get rid of all tasks
they're running in the background here
so I'll use test mentor here go ahead
and kill selected apps and I will close
all applications here on the iPhone 4 as
well just to keep things fair I like you
know that these applications aren't all
running it just makes the test seem a
bit fair to have everything sort of
close in the background and this is
really the only way you can close all
your applications to go through one by
one that does take some time if you if
you need to
although the 512 megabytes of RAM and
the iPhone 4 you should never really do
this but for testing purposes I wanted
to make sure everything was closed so
we're gonna look at two websites that
we've loaded on here before so it'll be
a test of sites you visit on a regular
basis we're gonna look at TechnoBuffalo
calm and my youtube channel and these
are right now both connected over the
same Wi-Fi network so we'll go ahead and
bust open the internet alright and we
will go to TechnoBuffalo each will stop
that I'll go to tech con Buffalo here
and this has been loaded on both devices
in the past and will do the same thing
here all right someone to go and hit go
on both the same time and see if we can
get a fair comparison and we're off
and again booked it with the same Wi-Fi
both very fast processors
it looks like the Evo's got a bit of an
edge iPhone 4 caught up and finished
very quickly if you loaded a different
site to start over
okay so that book browsers here open
they've got TechnoBuffalo on there I'm
gonna refresh the page and see how this
looks
go ahead and hit go there and the green
button down there and we're off at
exactly the same time which is hard to
do they might expect we'll see which one
loads first
looks like the Evo has a bit of a lead
the Evo has done and the iPhone 4 is
still loading up and now it was done
it's this kind of interesting tester to
season things that are going on the Evo
is capable of playing Flash content
whereas the Flash content on the iPhone
is just not viewable so speeds here it's
like the Evo was a bit faster let's try
another website will try my YouTube
channel and see if there's a difference
is there no same thing here
all right try and hit both of these here
at the same time again clothes on me
okay so we got that one and we have
right there and we're off the same time
and let's see which one loads the
YouTube page a bit faster let's see if
the Evo still holds that widget and it
looks like it is loading faster and the
Evo is done and now the iPhone 4 is done
now you'll notice that right here it's
saying you zoom in cannot be played this
does support flash but often times
YouTube videos that are viewed from the
webpage just don't play the Flash
content that plays it sort of sometimes
if he's sometimes not and definitely not
all that smooth but you can't see that
it works you can see that there are the
ads that are showing up there so storing
Flash content
let's check about now scrolling on both
of these and how is pinching and zooming
words you can scroll sort of relatively
quickly though that physics engine isn't
necessarily all that smooth a bit jerky
but it does work on the iPhone the
scrolling is very smooth multi-touch do
the same thing it's not terribly smooth
but it does work double tap to zoom
double tap to zoom it's actually loading
a web page here if I want to zoom in
very silky smooth double tap to zoom
double tap to zoom so over the same
Wi-Fi network you are going to get a bit
faster speeds on the Evo 4G and you're
gonna get flash I think from a
smoothness standpoint the iPhone 4 is a
little bit of a better browsing
experience but that's gonna be a
personal preference if flash is
important to you then the Evo 4G is
gonna be a great way to go so now that
these are running on different networks
let's test a network speed I'm going to
turn off Wi-Fi and I'm going to refresh
you both of these pages here so let me
go back the page and I will refresh it
so we can see whether or not Sprint's
network holds a candle to a TN t--'s or
vice versa and again this is gonna vary
depending on where you are in your
location I'm in Southern California I've
got about three bars three to four bars
of 3G here on Sprint you go ahead and
turn off Wi-Fi I'll do is live on camera
so you can see if there's no funny
business going on turn off Wi-Fi same
thing here
kicked off Wi-Fi alright so we're gonna
go ahead and refresh this page and see
if we have any difference so go ahead
and hit go there it will do the same
thing here blue alright and we are off
now we're using 3G networks for both
we're not using Wi-Fi I've got the three
bars of 3G for Sprint and about four
bars for AT&amp;amp;T
it looks like sprint loaded it first any
TNT is still loading and now just about
done so from a browsing standpoint
Mervin get a faster experience on the
evo these results are been duplicated
throughout my test something to keep in
mind so this round is going to go to the
Evo so let's go ahead and move right
along here and update my records and
let's talk about text entry if there's a
lot of text entry that is important to a
phone like this sort of certainly not
having a physical keyboard how well you
can input text is going to be a but most
important so let's start here with the
Evo we'll go to messages will do a new
message and let's tap to compose so a
couple cool things you can do here first
and I show that this worked very well
you give a text to speech it's another
way to enter text let me give that
demonstration of that here gonna have to
hold it up to my thing so to do so go
ahead just push that little microphone
icon this is a test of the keyboard on
the Evo 4G
this is a test of the keyboard on the
Evo 4G well some might say so but that
is very very close I could send that
somewhere that would work in real world
tests are very accurate with this on
screen or this keyboard where you can
just speak and the Texas Beach doesn't
work very well but if you don't want to
talk into your phone how is a keyboard
itself well let's try this one more time
and it'll do with typing test here
try and type winnie-the-pooh send the
gross i got mini the crew who sounds
gross the other correct on android is a
very good if the phone doesn't have
physical keyboard you need to have a
good autocorrect so this works quite
well a small mistake not that big a deal
because the phone is so large the
keyboard is really nice now it gets even
huger if we do a little switch here
let's try this one more time
winning the pooh sounds gross so i'm not
the most accurate on this but the
keyboard is very big and you'd get used
to it very quickly admittedly in for the
next test i am an iphone user so i'm a
bit more used to the iphone keyboard
although this is very usable and really
nice and easy to navigate and you get
arrow keys on the side so if you're
worried about a keyboard don't evil 4g
really does a fantastic job as this
android as a whole now let's go ahead
and take a look at the iPhone 4 I'm
gonna go ahead and open up a new note
go ahead typed on there and we will do
the same thing and see if I'm any more
accurate so Winnie the Pooh sound gross
kind of close let's try it in landscape
so we need the food sounds gross I'm a
bit more accurate on the iPhone but
maybe because I'm it's an iPhone user I
feel like I could get used to very
quickly the keyboard on the Evo 4G so I
want to give you that is now sort of a
camera demonstration I think that's sort
of accordance to talk about it both
these devices so let's go ahead and get
started and talk about the cameras first
and I'll show you some demonstrations go
ahead and get back to home so the camera
on the iPhone 4 is a 5 megapixel sensor
on the back and a point 3 camera on the
front and it has a single LED flash the
camera on the Evo 4G is an 8 megapixel
sensor with a 1.3 megapixel camera on
the front and has a dual LED flash so
from the specs standpoint it sounds like
Eva for GE has a little bit of a an edge
I'm not gonna go now and put in some
pictures and video and see how rear
world quality actually works
all right so now that guys have seen the
cameras on each which one do you think
is better in my opinion the video
quality on the iPhone 4 as far as to
peers what we're gonna get on the Evo 4G
despite the fact they both shoot in 720
however I think the still picture
quality on the Evo it's a bit better
than what we see on the iPhone it may be
due to the dual LED flash in low-light
situations so we're gonna call the
camera around a draw so now let's talk
about speed and which one of these are
quicker since they both run the similar
processors have similar specs cos
factions you're gonna be in really every
day likes you already stopped browsing
now let's try an opening including some
applications that we use on a regular
basis so we'll go ahead and close
everything else out again do the same
thing here on the iPhone got a lot of
things open as you can tell there we go
now we're dealing with some fresh and
fresh on each let's go ahead and open up
something familiar we'll go to what we
tried opening up the camera on each of
these here so I put up the tiny bit
faster there on the Evo let's go ahead
and try something else I know this is a
very unscientific test let's try opening
something that both have I believe I owe
Penang up settings setting something
good one so almost instantaneous on the
Evo a bit slower on the iPhone let's go
ahead and try one more thing that both
have close that let's try open up this
stops applications so a bit quicker
there on the iPhone overall opening and
closing applications it tend to be just
a tiny bit zippier and almost everything
on the Evo 4G the iPhone 4s by no means
slow its mark
the 3GS but things open just a little
bit slower on the iPhone versus the Evo
so I'd be remiss to compare both of
these two about talking about the
operating systems and serve how that
played into effect and how that works
for the phones we're gonna have a
love-hate relationship quads are within
one of these Apple does a few things
very very well first they did the best
implementation to multi-touch they're
integrated in seamless experiences
really second to none if you willing to
live with inside of Apple's walled
garden if you're okay with the iTunes
iPhone I infrastructure the iPhone is a
fantastic device personally I'm okay
with that and I use the iPhone as my
daily driver however on the other end of
the spectrum we have Android which is
really much more open you can do a lot
with that you can customize the
operating system you have a lot more
tweaks and things you can change a lot
more home scripts you can have got
something here called snap which is a
HTC Sense feature and you can jump
target for home screens and customize
them with widgets really any way you
choose so if we have to talk about
operating system customization or do you
think is a very important thing to talk
about the Evo is going to get the edge
if we're talking about operating systems
together I think it's definitely got to
be a draw it's really gonna come down to
every one you like the best so we're
gonna do a final tally here display went
to the iPhone processor was a draw
storage went to the iPhone camera was a
draw connectivity went to the Evo
battery was a draw browser went to the
Evo speed we just saw it a little bit
quicker on the Evo text entry was it
drop customization I think goes to the
Evo in general OS is a draw so if we
were to tackle and add all these up
we've got one two rounds for the iPhone
one two three four rallies for the Evo
and we have one two three four five
rounds or a draw so we do have a winner
here the winner is the Evo 4G it's a
fantastic phone personally I use the
iPhone as my daily driver but in all
fairness the Evo did win in all of these
tasks that we conducted you can't go
wrong with either but if you can choose
which one you want in your in a 4G
network be very hard not to recommend
the sprites Evo 4G so do you guys agree
or disagree my way off I'll be sure to
