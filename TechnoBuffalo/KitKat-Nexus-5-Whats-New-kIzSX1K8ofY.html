technobuffalo here I want to give you
guys a first look at some of the new
features found on Android 4.4 KitKat and
talk about some kind of cool nuances
found on the Nexus 5 it's go ahead get
started so there are a ton of new
features crammed into Android 4.4 KitKat
we'll talk about some of the highlights
there are also some really cool subtle
things about the nexus 5 we ran through
all the specs the Snapdragon 800 the
rest of that was something you might not
notice the buttons on the side are all
ceramic so it'll be really durable to
phone lands on its side they also have
kind of a nice feel to it wireless
charging is built-in it's the chief
standard no need for a replaceable
backplate i'm looking at you samsung i'm
looking at you nokia so that's kind of
nice there so there are a lot of great
features in KitKat let's start with one
of my favorite and that is google now
you can now talk to it like you could on
the Moto X although unlike the Moto X
it's not going to learn your voice
pretty much anybody could walk up your
phone when it's on and say ok Google
search technobuffalo and then you get
your full Google now search anything you
want to do on Google now is still here
Kyle people have asked if it'll work
when the screen is off it will not and
i'll show you ok google now nothing
black screen it also won't work from the
lock screen ok Google now I'll go from
the lock screen you can swipe up and you
can access google now directly there but
kind of neat feature that you can talk
to it now I wish to add the same sort of
technology the Moto X hat i wish to
other notifications the Moto X hat and
screen is off but does have improved
google now and that is always good so
visually those things have improved as
well you've got a new cleaned up menu
but I don't have that line across the
top it's sort of just sits there
floating and looks really nice my
opinion right down below so you can see
that you also have a new animation going
to the app drawer it's kind of subtle
but it is definitely also have a
translucent now app drawer you can see
the home screens that are showing up
behind it kind of neat the nexus 5 also
has hdr+ on the camera side so if you
want to take crazy hgr pictures will
take a few I images and teach them all
together and give you one kind of
awesome image that's yours well lose
right there
gr + on or hdr+ off also just kind of
need some meth alle playing around the
zoom is it's bent weeks of you zoom in
tells you how far or what percentage
zoom you're using so or three times four
times five times whatever it is will
show you right there it's kind of a kind
of a neat visual cue that I found going
back to the home screen you also have a
new settings icon it's bigger a little
more cartoonish but it kind of looks the
same you can now move home strangers
catenin as well you can have you know
whatever home screens you want but if
you hold it down you can not only move
them left or right we now get this new
screen go into wallpapers widgets or
jump right into settings so that was
kind of improved as well you've got some
other things here smart dialer door
prioritized contacts based on who you
call or search the most also you can
search for restaurants and stuff right
from the dialer caller ID here is
improved as well it doesn't recognize a
number it'll search Google try and find
what that is and i'll show you when it
calls hangouts is now integrated with
SMS which you might like you might not
like for me I don't enjoy that for the
nice thing about androids you can
download any third-party SMS app and set
it as default if you don't want to use
hangouts emoji are built into the
keyboard as well you've got some
improved settings and ability for
wireless printing which now has its own
little setting here in the settings
window so you can see cloud print or
send right to HP services so that's
kinda neat and new there are a lot of
other tweaks here on android 4.4 kitkat
to some of the big ones I would have
liked you to seeing some other things
like a default way to show the battery
percentage would have been nice
obviously I can do that with cyanogen
there are apps and widgets you can do
they'll show up I would have liked a to
have been built in first impressions Oh
been really positive Nexus 5 it feels
great androids really really quick as
you'd expect from a Snapdragon 800 with
no skin on it it's a blazing fast phone
haven't quite yet tested the camera but
first impressions looks to be very good
sir the improvement over the Moto X for
example and it's certainly be
improvement over the Nexus 4 as well
we'll put all that stuff through the
paces and I'll do cover and when you are
for review but anything you guys want to
see be sure to let me know and leave in
the comments down below till next time
