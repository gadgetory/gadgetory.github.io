TechnoBuffalo here and today we're
taking a first look at the lg optimus G
pro this guy has not yet been picked up
by any US carriers we are taking a look
at it all dolled up in its GSM unlocked
version with support for 4G LTE which
he'd expect now for most modern phones
kind of an odd look to the bunk with the
dots that sort of fade up to the top
let's go ahead and take a look I have
not had a chance to see this guy in
person yet so I'm pretty excited to take
a look this phone would probably most
closely be related to Samsung's Galaxy
Note 2 so we'll pick that up grab the
phone feels pretty solid in the hand
push it off the side for just a real
quick second and then we'll run through
the specs everything the phone has and
turn it on so let's see what you're
going to get in the box you've got a
wall wart with different country
adapters on the top we've got pretty
nice-looking pair of headphones here
quad beat headphones might usually go
into too much detail about headphones
these ones actually look relatively nice
so you've got earbuds got metal accent
tips you have volume controls and inline
mic on it than some other size earbuds
depending on how big or little your ear
is we've got a charge and sync cable
here nothing overly exciting there we've
got a ginormous 31 40 milliamp hour
battery it's 3,140 million
push it off to the side we got some
looks not sure what language that is in
we've got some other stuff and some
cards and dock I suppose or a perhaps
for charging an extra battery I'll take
a look at that guy and see what it is
but that's not why you're here to see
the accessories you want to see the
phone so let's go ahead and peel off the
screen protector because those
fingerprints are really bothering me
boom and here we've got the lg optimus G
pro Android 4.1 as powering it push that
off to the side it's also got that same
similar back that we saw on the Nexus 4
but this is plastic and does have a
removable battery so go ahead and pull
that stuff off there as well from two
men
standpoint it's five point nine inches
by three inches by pretty decent 0.37
chah's and weighs 6.0 four ounces so the
screen is uh pretty similar to the note
to 5.5 inches that's a full 1080p when
powered by a 1.7 gigahertz quad-core
Snapdragon 600 processor which is the
same processor actually found in HTC one
two gigs of ram 32 gigs of storage plus
micro SD which is nice
13 megapixel camera on the back 2.1 on
the front
bluetooth 4.0 and NFC so enough of me
gibber jabbing about the phone when we
pop in the battery and we'll see how
this guy performs back in just a second
so I was going to pump in this battery
that came in it but it turns out there's
already one in there so we solve the
mystery of what this big piece is
actually a separate battery charger it's
nice that LG included two gigantic
batteries so that's either a great sign
or a really bad sign
for battery so that's already in there
and of course on the back you can see
the NFC radio there go ahead and power
all that stuff back and power the phone
on power button lives on the right hand
side go ahead and continue our tour
while it's booting up there's your
little finger slot if you want to pull
off the plastic back on the left we've
got a volume rocker up and down and not
sure what that's button is going to do
maybe it'll map to a camera perhaps you
can set it for what you want it's
booting up looks like this one is set
for SK Telecom so all that language I
didn't know is probably Korean I've got
a 3.5 millimeter headset jack I believe
that that is an IR blaster sort of some
metal-looking accents around it but
they're not real metal here on the
bottom is where you're charging syncing
cable is going to be and I believe
they'll do double duty as HDMI out we've
got some noise cancelling mic sand all
the camera stuff that we've talked about
in the first part of the video so we are
all set up here I'm gonna go and do the
setup and now I'll come back in just a
minute and we'll walk through what else
she's got in the Optimus G pro alright
so we've got it all set up and ready to
rock and the screen looks absolutely
gorgeous as you'd expect from a full
1080p screen so LG has done a lot of
tweakin with android is android 4.1.2
and i'll show you guys that and like I
can show you some of the tweaks that
they've done here so the settings is
broken up into four different categories
network sound display and
a neural which first blush actually
makes things very easy to find so I'll
go to about phone we'll take a look at
some of the software information you can
see that we are running android 4.1.2
one here so the big difference is you'll
notice is when you pull this down you've
got a lot of shortcuts here you can
scroll through and turn different things
on and off but I really like what LG has
got is some things called qslide apps
and that's very similar to actually what
sony has and Samsung has something sort
of similar so if I go ahead and open a
memo for example it's going to open it
up in a little window that's going to
show up right on top of the screen you
can move it around depending on where
you want it you can go ahead and start
typing you can see what the keyboard
looks like as well and of course the
Android if you don't like that keyboard
you can download a ton of other options
you've got those qslide apps and there
are just a few of those right now
hopefully we'll be seeing more coming up
I really like the calculator one there
and calendar q voice also very nice sort
of they're similar answer to s voice so
a ton of options here before we actually
get to what your notifications are you
only have the bottom half of the screen
but fortunately you've got a 5.5 inch
screen here in which to work with so the
way you handle would it themself is also
different if you long press you've got
apps downloads widgets and wallpapers
you can see what the widgets are most of
them are pretty stock Android but there
are a few custom ones that are done for
LG and we've got the SK Telecom version
so some are very custom for SK Telecom
and this phone has some other odd things
in it that we don't see very often here
in the US that are kind of cool to check
out so go ahead and hit home and
speaking of home we've got a physical
button there and flanked on the left and
right is a capacitive back button and
menu button if you want to get to your
multitasking window which looks like
normal Android multitasking just hold
the home button you can swipe stuff off
to close it taking a look here what the
screen looks like when dealing with text
or giving up images
it looks pretty crisp you know on first
blush text looks very clear as you'd
expect an image is least that I've seen
I look very good but of course we'll
test those on our for review to see how
it performs and definitely check it out
versus the Galaxy Note 2 build quality
here looks to be really nice actually
it's got a very strong solid feel to it
despite being plastic which is
oftentimes knocked on devices this one
feels really really
nice this button here is still a mystery
to me go go and push it into what
happens looks like it opens up a memo
screen you go ahead and start writing or
write on the screen with your finger you
do not have any sort of included stylus
here I'll go ahead and hit home if I can
get that stuff to go away but you might
not have a stylus but you have something
different here this little tab pulls up
what I thought was gonna reveal some
sort of stylus but just kept going going
and going and going until it stops it is
a TV antenna which is something very
unique to the Korean market and
certainly other countries they've got
full TV tuner built in here now I did to
scan for channels and fortunately we
don't have any they did include some I
guess it's it's the melon system they
call it in Korea but does not work here
in the US so this ever does come to the
US don't expect that to be on board here
something also funny that I noticed in
the SK Telecom book when they give you
the examples of what to do they got a
little guy doing doing Gangnam style in
there I just found that funny so other
than that nothing else is really
different at least on first blush and
pretty curious to use the phone on see
how a performance to go ahead and get
pinched you can see all your different
home screens you could set default home
screens that's the stuff you can do with
Android so again any questions or things
you want to see be sure to let us know
let me bring in a Galaxy Note 2 just for
size comparison here so you guys can see
what the differences are and how they
look side-by-side so the same inch
screen certainly they look like
long-lost brothers and sisters to go
ahead and stack them side-by-side you
can see the difference here one thing I
noticed that when I weigh at the phone
feels the note2 feels more rounded when
you hold it this one feels more slab
like so if you you know like a feel of
one are they over the other definitely
keep that in mind certainly you've got
that cool pattern on the back of the
optimus G pro you don't have on the note
2 thank you guys for watching sure give
this video a thumbs up we definitely
appreciate it I'm John Ritter from
TechnoBuffalo and I'll see you in the
next video
buh-bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
