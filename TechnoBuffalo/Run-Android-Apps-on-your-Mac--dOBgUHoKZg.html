to you by domain.com hey what's going on
guys a Martin sang it from TechnoBuffalo
and whoever thought the day would come
when we could run native Android apps on
our desktops there's a range of Android
emulators already available on Windows
but on Mac your options are much more
limited
fortunately BlueStacks recently release
our application on Mac that'll allow
users to run native Android apps on top
of OS 10 think of it as a virtual OS
running on top of your desktop the
overall interface of BlueStacks is
pretty simple the home page features an
app store which shows recommended
applications that have been tested to
work with the emulator now these are
split into different categories
including top apps social and
communications audio and video and tools
and productivity just to name a few in
order to properly setup BlueStacks you
will need to sign in with your Google
account which shouldn't take more than a
few minutes once the initial setup is
finished you're pretty much all set and
you're ready to download apps from the
Google Play Store a big concern that I
had prior to installing BlueStacks was
performance now since these apps are
running natively on top of a virtual
Android OS I wasn't sure how well these
apps would perform since they weren't
really developed for desktops but to my
surprise apps work really well on a 2012
iMac with 32 gigabytes of RAM and an i7
processor apps like clash of clans
Crossy road asphalt 8 and boom dots were
smooth there's little no lag in any of
the games that I played and I also
tested out Instagram though I did run
into some problems trying to upload a
picture but nonetheless it's still
pretty cool
what's awesome about BlueStacks for Mac
is that it supports Retina displays and
also multi-touch gestures on Apple's
trackpad clash of clans for example will
take advantage of the multi-touch
feature to zoom in and out of the field
the main reason why I would want to
install an Android emulator on my Mac is
because of the games that are available
on Android that aren't really available
natively on PC or Mac there are
thousands of great games that are
available on Android and the ability to
play them directly on my computer is
pretty awesome previously running an
emulator on a Mac required a virtual PC
or a full fledged Windows OS via boot
camp but having a native app on Mac
negates the need to run a virtual OS on
top of another virtual OS BlueStacks has
been out on Windows for quite some time
now and the company says it already has
around 90 million users which is pretty
impressive let me stop the video real
