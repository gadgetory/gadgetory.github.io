on the 160 gigabyte Apple TV as I'll go
into a little bit more detail for what I
wanted the Apple TV for does everything
I was looking for something that I could
stream my video from my computer to my
television for and all my music I've got
more music and audio that I could fill
out my iPod so just hooking it up with
cables to my TV I wasn't really an
option for me and I didn't want to hook
up my computer to the television be
worried about getting damaged or falling
off so a little stand that I have so for
me the Apple TV is great I knew going in
that it didn't wasn't a DVR that you
couldn't download wirelessly you know
you have to know all that before you
before you purchase but if you know what
the flaws are you can really appreciate
the the shiny aspects of it and that's
really just a video and audio playback
is is top-notch it's not high-def it
looks better than anything on standard
television so guys enjoy the review any
questions or comments let me know and
thank you for subscribing all right all
right guys let's get down to it so here
is the main menu for the Apple TV with
the recent software update you can see
it's got movies TV shows YouTube music
podcasts photos settings and sources and
I'll go through each one for you very
quickly right now this is stuff that I
have streamed from my computer and store
it on the hard drive of the Apple TV so
I'll show you what a movie looks like
that's been downloaded from iTunes
alright so the Caribbean the second one
pick some that explode up begin to
resume playing for you or start
beginning I'll read employing
sailes brace the foreyard there you go
as you guys can see I don't know if you
can see it through the video here the
quality is excellent
doesn't look pixelated from far back or
up close when I looked in the Apple
store it looks very pixelated maybe
there's a TV or the tension they had but
here on mine HD bang on standard
elevator do you can also in the movie
section view some patrocle trailers that
will stream from the internet and again
they look good too here's one for Eagle
versus shark until long it takes to load
up buffering and then it goes it's
playing and I'm just on a wireless links
this G route or not even end so you can
see how quick it is and pretty smooth
movie looks fine same guys did flight of
the conchords so there's the movie
section here TV shows looks the same I
got the episode 24 I've been watching
look just like any other episode of 24
on standard television looks good
go down here next to YouTube
some of the new features are added with
the recent software updates lets you
view YouTube videos just like you can on
the iPhone let's check out one of them
to show you how long it takes to load
here's the first one that comes up here
takes a minute to buffer
and there goes now it's playing yeah
sing you kiss quality you haven't known
to see all that the Apple TV really does
everything that I wanted it to do
I've got more video and audio files and
I can store on my ipod those nights
about have the option of having
everything streamed right to my
television if I'm cleaning up the
kitchen neck listen to music
we're just show you in a minute if I
want to watch some TV that I downloaded
you can do it it's like I said it's all
for everybody before it I needed to do
it's excellent
so we could add a YouTube here music
looks just like your iPod shuffle song
music videos playlists artists I'll show
you what it looks like when you play
something though let's do a artists pick
one here is Audioslave for example see
what it looks like when we play pulls up
the album art
there you go one cool thing about Apple
TV is whether you're watching already
listening to music or going through
pictures I'll show you in a minute it
pulls up a screensaver so it doesn't
burn an image into your your flat-screen
TV I'll show you again the screen saver
is a minute you've got the option of
pictures that you have stored on here
album covers or just random Apple image
I'll show you guys right now what that
screensaver looks like you can set it to
go at different time intervals I've got
mine set to go at 2 minutes so here is
what it looks like alright so anyway
here to hear the screensaver it's a
bunch of pictures as you play another
song it pops up in the back right hand
corner it rotates around pretty cool
alright so that was a music section of
it podcasts I don't have any just pulled
podcasts down for my tunes that you have
set to go on your iPod or a computer
photo is very cool pulls on all the
photos that you have from anywhere kind
of neat
holding all the playlists from from
iPhoto I don't know how it does not a PC
guess that I've got a Mac settings as
you go through it about to be a
resolution whether it's really at 720
1080i 1080p the network it's got a
wireless and built-in iTunes stores
nothing there yet
and doesn't let you download stuff just
pulls up a language thing there
screensaver you can set the screensaver
brightness software updates it'll check
for updates automatically to reset the
settings under sources one of the cool
things here is anybody who brings their
computer into your wireless network you
can actually stream a video from them
artistry musical it's very cool as you
guys saw earlier on YouTube for example
the streaming is very smooth overall I
really like the Apple TV like I said
before I need it for its excellent does
everything I needed to do everything I
wanted it to do I knew what the
shortcomings were I knew that it wasn't
a DVR going in
and that's okay I have a DVR for that
and Apple TV is not for everybody but if
you want a great way to get your content
from your computer to your television
without having to hook up your iPod with
cables and all that stuff the Apple TV
is a really great way to do it with a
lot more storage space anyway guys just
a very quick review I hope it was
helpful there's obviously a lot more I
could've gone into if you have any
questions let me know and I'll try and
answer it for you thing for thanks for
watching and thank you all for
subscribing and enjoy bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
