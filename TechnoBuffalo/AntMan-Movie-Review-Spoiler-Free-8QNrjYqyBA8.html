technobuffalo here and i'm back with
another movie review this is my fourth
one that i've done and i'm loving the
opportunity to review films i've always
loved movies the chance to get a talk
about them is really cool for me i'm
going to do this one spoiler free but
you guys want to see future movie
reviews which boilers leave a comment
down below and let me know so i got to
go to the premiere of ant-man which was
awesome to be at and to see that all the
stars walked the red carpet you guys
want to see it look like behind the
scenes and what it's like to be at a
premiere I'll put a link to that video
down below so going into ant-man I had a
few big questions first can Paul Rudd be
a superhero and like ant-man it was like
a very obscure Marvel character 9 yeah
he became bigger and was in the Avengers
and kind of that kind of thing but it
wasn't a character that had the name
recognition of some of the other Marvel
characters so I was a little dubious
going in I've had some production issues
they lost their director a new director
had to come in Peyton Reed with only
about a year left to make the movie and
sort of there was a bit of question
marks about how the script is going to
turn out but rest not dear friends the
movie is awesome in fact in the pantheon
of Marvel movies and that's the Marvel
Studios movies are not counting the ones
that Fox has or spider-man that Sony has
the order for me goes like this it goes
the very first Iron Man so that was
incredible it goes gardens of the galaxy
and very closely behind guarding the
galaxy was ant-man it was awesome Paul
Rudd was so perfectly cast for this role
in fact the director said the role was
written with him in mind the movie has
heart the movie has a ton of humor and
it's the funniest Marvel movie they've
ever done the supporting cast is
incredible Michael Pena afterward a fan
of him before you absolutely worried by
the time this movie is done his lining
to deliver to perfection these comic
relief and it was just really well done
special effects were incredible the way
they handled the interaction King Paul
Rudd in the Hanse was really cool as
well Michael Douglas was great in it
there's a scene where they make Michael
Douglas look really young the beginning
and that was crazy to see
I'm the CGI it looked absolutely
incredible not going to spoil anything
but they're definitely some familiar
faces from the Marvel world that show up
in this movie it was just really
enjoyable to watch especially going in
not knowing much about ant-man they did
a very good job sort of giving some of
the history he'll be transitioning over
to the new ant-man out to Scott Lang
which is played of course by Paul Rudd
the story essentially is I won't give
away anything that they don't show in
the trailers there was an ant-man suit
created by dr. Hank Pym he finds a sort
of Robin Hood character service and
stealing money and giving it to the poor
and Paul Rudd they team up and they go
and do ant-man things Corey Stoll as the
bad guy he's a villain by the name of
yellow jacket was absolute incredible
and the yellow jacket suit looks
ridiculously bad ass in person Corey
Stoll was absolutely incredible in this
movie everybody the movie was really
well cast it was well directed and I'd
really enjoyed every minute of it I
brought my wife with me who has seen all
the Marvel movies but knows nothing
about comic books really has no interest
at all in comic books and she loved it
if you don't know what not you should
bring your girlfriend boyfriend whomever
it's not in photo type of movies they
will really really enjoy it when you do
go to cigna theaters though be sure to
stick around through the credits there
are two after credits scene 1 this ribs
in the middle and then one that's at the
very end so be sure to stick around so
anyway should come away knowing about
this movie it's entertaining as hell
really fun to watch it's funny swell
acting it's well directed and overall
just really well done go see ant-man
don't worry about not knowing the
character you will have a great time
Kevin see any other mother movies don't
worry this one can stand on its own it
was just a really fun ride I think you
guys will enjoy and our guys let me know
what you think again if you want more
spoilers went to tell you everything
that happens let me know down below and
I will do that in the next one but I'm
trying to keep it as relatively spoil it
for you so everybody can enjoy and I
until next time John read your free
