TechnoBuffalo here over the years we've
been conditioned to think the more
expensive the product the better it's
going to be but that's not necessarily
true
so I wanted to kind of put it to the
test and pick a random product so ladies
and gentlemen meet the $50 dragon touch
y8 8x Plus running a very kind of forked
version of Android 4.4 KitKat and it's
exactly it expected $40 tablet inside
the box not getting anything too
exciting and get your power adapter get
the tablet itself and that's really
going to be it respect standpoint 50
bucks are going to get you a 7 inch IPS
screen with a resolution of 1024 by 600
it's a quad core processor don't really
know what processor is in it 8 gigs of
storage its 512 gigabytes of RAM 10
pixel camera in the back which looks
like the old like VGA Razer style
cameras
it does have Wireless and built in so
you're not getting away the specs but
does that matter this comparison is
probably the $50.00 Kindle Fire but they
are you're dealing with ads Amazon is
subsidizing the price of that tablet so
this is a true $50 tablet and it's good
at a lot of things and not surprisingly
really crappy at a lot of things if all
you're doing on a tablet is consuming if
I are doing is browsing the web you're
watching YouTube videos this is actually
a perfectly good option it's fast enough
for smooth scrolling it's fast enough
for smooth HD video playback at least as
HD the screen can be speakers aren't
horrible 3.5 millimeter headset jack is
there so you can just very easily put in
some headphones I've got expandable
storage you can blow it up all your
movies for an airplane ride if that's
all you use a tablet for you don't have
to spend 200 300 400 500 ever it might
be for a tablet this works really well
and if you lose it you're only out fifty
bucks
I didn't data curiosity want to
benchmark it because I figured I don't
know why not so the quadrant score on it
is 3374 it puts it on pace with the
Motorola Atrix 4G from many many years
ago so no performance powerhouse what do
guys think would you pick one of these
up is it a waste of 50 bucks let's hear
your thoughts on it what would you use
this for would be a gift would use it
just for traveling and don't worry if
you lose it those are your thoughts on
it the video thumbs up always appreciate
it the button Dumbo
Oh looks like this the next time I am
gender from TechnoBuffalo and I am
actually going to use my dragon touch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
