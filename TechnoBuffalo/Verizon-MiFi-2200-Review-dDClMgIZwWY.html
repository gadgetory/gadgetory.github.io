what's up guys so instead of an
introduction I think I'm just gonna go
ahead and babble nervously so the
verizon mifi 2200 really is a very cool
device or flows you that maybe not
familiar with it you haven't seen some
of my prior videos let me recap what
this does there is a sprint version of
this as well it takes verizon's evdo rev
a network so there are 3g network
essentially sucks it in kicks it out as
a Wi-Fi signal that up to five people
can connect to so lets you use verizon's
Wi-Fi signal really wherever you are so
let's talk about some of the positives
of the device it is really small and
very pocketable it's about the size of
eight credit card staff which is quite
nice you can very easily slide this in
your backpack you're perched your back
pocket your man purse wherever you want
and it's not going to take up that much
room battery life is relatively strong
at four hours using an eleven hundred
and fifty million power battery
something huge but it does have a micro
USB port so you can plug this into a
computer actually live in charge while
it's working which is quite nice I've
also been very impressed with verizon
wireless's data speeds I ran a speed
test last week sort of showing how quick
things work and page is loaded very fast
it was quite impressive certainly for
everyday browsing and emailing this is
going to be almost as fast as your
regular brawn beds beans even if your
megabits per second are crazy fast or
crazy slower you know when you're just
looking at a website you know CNN
whatever it is you're looking at keep
waving this thing around it's going to
load very fast it's quick enough even
for some mobile gaming if Ronnie uses
for Xbox Live or the playstation network
or whatever the Nintendo calls their
thing this can actually work for it um
some of the downsides of the device
itself I wish had a battery indicator I
have no idea how much battery is left on
here
without an external screen to sort of
show it or a button that you push with
some LED lights I got no way of telling
where the battery is going to die and
will just die it's got a light that
blinks when he lets you know is
connected but other than that that's
about it for external indicators I
definitely wish I could sort of tell
what the battery life was far as a
device itself goes that's really the
only negative that I had with it it does
exactly what you expect it to do exactly
as advertised so let's talk about some
of the plans the things that you need to
get with this well you can buy this on
contract meaning your hang less and
you're signing a two-year contract so I
think of it as such than just a cell
phone same concept applies you can sign
a contract pay a subsidized lower price
and you're stuck into a one or two-year
contract with set rates each month in
the my thighs case you can get five gigs
and the top five gigs of storage space
it's five gigs of bandwidth so it's five
gigs up or down per month for sixty
dollars or for forty dollars per month
you can get to it in 50 megabytes which
is totally crazy if you get the 250
megabytes alright megabytes and you go
over which definitely will you're going
to be paying ten cents per megabyte over
which is huge if you get the sixty
dollar five gig plan Julian paying five
cents per megabyte over some people say
you know five gigs that's not going to
be enough it's not going to be enough if
you're doing just regular browsing it's
going to be plenty five gigs is actually
an almost equivalent of eight hours of
video streaming so if you're going to
add straight video shipping for eight
straight hours that will take up your
five if you're just doing emailing some
picture downloading even some YouTube
video watching you're going to be fine
i'm not going to come close to hitting
that threshold i'm very animated with my
hands today now i'm going to come close
to hitting that threshold 60 bucks is
definitely a little bit on the expensive
side but you are getting well a nice
wireless internet anywhere you go so
people are always asking at least you've
been asking me what's the advantage of
the mifi over a USB dongle or something
i can plug into my computer well the
advantages are
quite numerous let me tell you what they
are first no USB port if you're using a
macbook air or a netbook or a device
with a few USB ports those are precious
so this doesn't take one the next really
big point of it if you can share it with
your friends if you're out your college
student for example around at the
library and they don't have internet
there you can share this with five
people and you can encrypt it and you
get full sort of router maintenance
online they would with any other router
whether it's an airport extreme a
linksys and that year a whatever weird
OEM you might have you get all the same
options with the mifi so it's quite
handy in that regard in addition one of
the things I mentioned in a previous
video you can use your iPhone or another
phone essentially on verizon's network
since this is just Wi-Fi suck it in
there evdo rev a network you can use
skype or another client in conjunction
with call forwarding you never really
have to go through AT&amp;amp;T or whatever your
other carriers if you're with sprint do
you don't want to go through them or
you're with tmobile you don't want to go
with them it really is a nice option you
can use it with more than just a
computer with the USB port to use it
with anything I've been thrilled with
the mifi most of the things that I get I
used to review and then I sent back for
this I bought and I was quite happy to
buy it now I bought it going back to the
whole contract thing i bought this
without a contract so i paid about two
hundred and sixty dollars for it but i
can stop my $60 monk plant whenever I
like I can put it on hold essentially if
I say you know i'm not using it i'm not
gonna be traveling for a while to put it
on hold and if I'm going on vacation or
going somewhere where I'm going to need
it call verizon up say hey I want you to
turn it on and then I start paying my
plan again so I get a lot more freedom
than I would if I took the subsidy from
the device like this that runs you two
hundred sixty bucks I really can't see
why you would take the contract and the
long run is going to cost you much much
much more you end up saving about one
hundred and ten dollars total if you do
the contract and you're stuck with two
years you know the flexibility to stop
service suspend service and verizon's
the process of putting out a 4G network
which will certainly will come out the
net
your contract so that comes out all i
gotta do is to put this bad boy out
craigslist or ebay pick up the 4G
version i don't have to worry about any
early termination fees it's quite nice
and is a really I think affordable way
to go so if i decided i'm not using it
for a while I'm just going to suspend it
and if I need it again call rising up
and I'm good to go on a one-to-five
scale I highly recommend the verizon
wireless Wi-Fi and I give a very strong
five it does exactly what's advertised
and it does it extremely well I can't
speak for the sprint version but it's
made by the same company and I would
assume that if you get good sprint
service your experience will be just as
positive so guys hope you enjoyed my
sort of rambling on the my five if you
want some more information you can check
out verizonwireless com or sprint com if
you want the spread version same thing
