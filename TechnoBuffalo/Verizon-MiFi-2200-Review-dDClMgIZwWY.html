what's up guys so instead of an
introduction I think I'm just gonna go
ahead and babble nervously so the
Verizon my fight twenty two hundred
really is a very cool device blows you
that maybe not familiar with that you
haven't seen some of my prior videos let
me recap what this does and there's a
sprint version of this as well it takes
Verizon's EVDO Rev a network so there
are three G Network essentially sucks it
in kicks it out as a Wi-Fi signal that
up to five people can connect to so lets
you use Verizon's Wi-Fi signal really
wherever you are so let's talk about
some of the positives of the device it
is really small and very possible it's
about the size of eight credit card
stack which is quite nice you can very
easily slide this in your backpack your
purse your back pocket your man purse
wherever you want and it's not going to
take up that much room battery life is
relatively strong in four hours using an
1,150 milliamp hour battery something
huge but it does have a micro USB port
so you can plug this into a computer
actually live in charge while it's
working which is quite nice I've also
been very impressed with Verizon
Wireless --is data speeds I ran a speed
test last week sort of showing how quick
things work and page is loaded very fast
it was quite impressive
certainly for everyday browsing and
emailing this is gonna be almost as fast
as your regular broadband speeds even if
your megabits per second are crazy
faster crazy slower you know when you're
just looking at a website you know CNN
whatever it is you're looking at keep
waving this thing around it's gonna load
very fast it's quick enough even for
some mobile gaming if money uses for
Xbox Live or the PlayStation Network or
whatever the Nintendo calls their thing
this can actually work for it some of
the downsides of the device itself
I wish it had a battery indicator I have
no idea how much battery is left on here
and external screens to sort of show it
or a button that you push with some LED
lights I got no way of telling where the
battery's gonna die and we'll just die
it's got a light that blinks may let you
know is connected but other than that
that's about it for external indicators
but definitely wish that I could sort of
tell what the battery life was as far as
the device itself goes that's really the
only negative that I had with it it does
exactly what you'd expect it to do
exactly as advertised so let's talk
about some of the plans the things that
you need to get with this well you can
buy this on contract meaning you're
paying less and you're signing a
two-year contract so I think of it as
essentially just a cell phone same
concept applies you can sign a contract
pay a subsidized lower price and you're
stuck into a one or two-year contract
with set rates each month in the my vice
case you can get five gigs and the top
five gigs of storage space it's five
gigs of bandwidth so it's five gigs up
or down per month for $60 or for forty
dollars per month you can get two
hundred and fifty megabytes which is
totally crazy if you get the two hundred
fifty megabytes or megabytes and you go
over which definitely will you're gonna
be paying $0.10 per megabyte over which
is huge if you get the $60 five gig plan
million paying five cents per megabyte
over some people say you know five gigs
that's not gonna be enough it's not
gonna be enough if you're doing just
regular browsing it's going to be plenty
five gigs is actually an almost
equivalent of eight hours of video
streaming so if you're gonna s straight
video streaming for eight straight hours
that'll take up your five if you're just
doing emailing some picture downloading
even some YouTube video watching you're
going to be fine I'm not gonna come
close to hitting that threshold I'm very
animated with my hands today and I'm
gonna come close to hitting that
threshold sixty bucks is definitely a
little bit on the expensive side but you
are getting a nice wireless internet
anywhere you go so people are always
asking at least a fan
to me what's the advantage of the Maya
fight over a USB dongle or something I
can plug into my computer well the
advantages are actually quite numerous
let me tell you what they are first no
USB port if you're using a MacBook Air
or a netbook or a device with a few USB
ports those are precious so this doesn't
take one the next really big point of it
if you can share it with your friends if
you're out if your color student for
example around at the library and they
don't have internet there you can share
this with five people and you can
encrypt it and you get full sort of
router maintenance online they would
with any other router whether it's an
airport extreme a Linksys Netgear a
whatever weirdo emu might have you get
all of the same options with the MiFi so
it's quite handy in that regard in
addition to one of the things I
mentioned in a previous video you can
use your iPhone or another phone
essentially on Verizon's network since
this is just Wi-Fi suck it in there EVDO
Rev a network you can use Skype or
another client in conjunction with call
forwarding I never really have to go
through AT&amp;amp;T or whatever your other
carriers if you're with Sprint do you
don't want to go through them or you're
with t-mobile you don't want to go with
them it really is a nice option you can
use it with more than just a computer
with the USB port it can use it with
anything I've been thrilled with the
MiFi most of the things that I get I
used to review and then I sent back for
this I bought and I was quite happy to
buy it now I bought it going back to the
whole contract thing I bought this
without a contract so I paid about two
hundred and sixty dollars for it but I
can stop my $60 a month plant whenever I
like I can put it on hold essentially if
I say you know I'm not using it I'm not
gonna be traveling for a while to put it
on hold and if I'm going on vacation or
going somewhere where I'm gonna need it
call Verizon up say hey I want you to
turn it on and then I start paying my
plan again so I get a lot more freedom
than I would if I took the subsidy from
the device like this that runs you 260
bucks I really can't see why you would
take the contract and the long run is
gonna cost you much much much more you
end up saving about 110 dollars total if
you do the contract and you're stuck
with two years now the
ability to stop service suspend service
and Verizon's in the process of putting
out a 4g network which will certainly
will come out in that two-year contract
so that comes out all I gotta do is to
put this bad boy on Craigslist or Ebay
pick up the 4G version I don't have to
worry about any early termination fees
it's quite nice and it's a really I
think affordable way to go so if I
decide that I'm not using it for a while
I'm just gonna suspend it and if I meet
it again call rise it up and I'm good to
go on a one to five scale I highly
recommend the Verizon Wireless MiFi and
I'd give it a very strong five it does
exactly what's advertised and it does it
extremely well
I can't speak for the Sprint version but
it's made by the same company and I
would assume that if you get good Sprint
service your experience will be just as
positive so guys hope you enjoyed my
sort of rambling on the my five if you
want some more information you can check
out Verizon Wireless comm or sprint comm
if you want the spread version same
thing there is not a version currently
out for AT&amp;amp;T or t-mobile so nothing on
the GSM side for exclusive content check
me out at Twitter twitter.com slash John
for Lakers and if you want to learn more
about TechnoBuffalo quite obviously
check out TechnoBuffalo comm I will see
you guys in the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
