TechnoBuffalo here and today January
27th Apple and Steve Jobs finally took
the wraps off their much rumored
much-hyped tablet officially called the
iPad rumors of ice laid and a whole
bunch of other ones have been
circulating but iPad is the official
name so I wanna run you through the
specs of the bus and tell you about it
give you a recap of what Apple announced
today so first it is half an inch thin
which is incredibly thin weighs in at
1.5 pounds if you see me look down
because I got some notes the conference
just ended it's got a nine point seven
inch capacitive display which uses a LED
backlighting technology it's going to
come in three different
well actually six different flavors but
we'll get to that in a little bit
storage is going to be either 16 32 or
64 gigabyte capacities it's running a
Apple built one gigahertz chip is called
the Apple a4 chip it's built by PA semi
and company Apple acquired a little
while back it's got bluetooth 2.1 it's
got 802 11 and Wireless absconded
speaker and mic and a 30 pin connector
it has 10 hours of battery life or over
a month on standby and that's 10 hours
of actual video feeling so it's pretty
substantial battery nowhere on what the
size is
but certainly looks to be substantial
and of course that's built in and non
removable it can run all iPod and touch
and all iPhone applications at launch
there will be apps are Pacific just to
the iPad but any apps that can run on
the iPhone or iPod touch will run
perfectly scaled up of course on the
iPad and of course the run in full
screen as well I'll talk about apps a
little bit more in a minute apple also
announced a new application on the iPad
it's gonna be called iBook so it's going
to be a standalone app that'll be next
to the App Store or iTunes and it is
what it expect it is a complete online
bookstore very colorful interface Apple
is now in the e-book retailing market
using the open epub format which I'm
sure look like with some restrictions on
you easily can
two projectors on a reed on a bigger
screen books are gonna run $4.99 and up
they've got connections with some of the
major publishers so be getting releases
right off the bat that would be
available when the iPad launches which
we'll get to in just a moment they also
announced a new version of I work for
the iPad and for those you don't know
what I worked is it's Apple's version of
it's a Microsoft Office with a
spreadsheet a presentation program and a
word editing program completely modified
for the touchscreen they're gonna be
standalone applications though it being
downloadable for $9.99 each may be able
to pick those up right from the app
store to get any protect that like your
projector and show them up on a big
screen pretty handy I suppose it's going
to sink over USB case you're wondering
it's got the 30-pin connector the same
one that you use for your iPhone or iPod
Touch it is 3g connected or you're gonna
have the option of 3G connectivity if
you want 3G connectivity it's going to
be over AT&amp;amp;T rumors have been
circulating about perhaps a Verizon
version but that was not announced just
AT&amp;amp;T it's going to be a very reasonable
$29.99 per month for a limited data or
$14.99 for 250 megabytes of data and
that's no contract required you cancel
at any time you can activate it right on
the iPad itself it is going to be
unlocked so you can pop in any other SIM
card but it's going to be using the
micro sim we have to do sort of a new
SIM card so if you want to use it you
Mobile SIM card you can do that but you
have to get some sort of micro sim to
put in and painting Mobile's or the
standard data rates from a price point
and data rate I think that's a very fair
so they're going to be six versions of
this that are going to be available
you'd be able to get the 16 32 or 64
version without 3G or get the 16 32 64
gig version 2 with 3G so here are the
pricing starts at $4.99 for the 16 gig
without 3G and without 3G that pricing
goes for 16 gig $4.99 for 32 gig about
3G $5.99
and for 64 gig without 3G 699 and the
non 3G version is going to be shipping
within 60 days now if you want 3G it's
got to wait an additional 30 days to
ship so 90 days total and is pricing
with 3G 16 gig is going to be 629 32 gig
can be 729 and 64 gig is going to be 829
so you can be able to run from 829 the
high ends down to 499 on the low ones so
you should be able to find a model that
suits you best they announced this loop
accessories as well keyboard dock is
those things that's right into it it's
gonna have a case and some other dock
accessories it takes advantage of an
on-screen keyboard for typing it's a
full-on stream key board is a nine and
its point seven inch screen so you
actually won't be able to do full typing
on it the videos that they showed it
does look pretty smooth but I'm kind of
yet to be seen as to what 3G typing is
going to to look and feel like with the
iPad Apple is sort of once again a
victim of their own successes rumour
mill had been going purged about what
the tablet was going to have and didn't
end up having everything people expected
there are rumors of a front-facing
camera and multitasking they really
didn't show any of them the operating
system looks very similar to what's
found on the iPhone and iPod Touch there
are some pulldown notifications that you
can see and it seems to be a pretty
constant theme throughout it so you know
what that this is gonna be for you is
going to be yet to be seen the bikes is
capable of playing YouTube HD it can
play video content right in the browser
not using flash they demonstrated some
New York Times applications and others
including MLB be able to watch live MLB
games the Ruby apps are just specific
for the iPad but those not won't be
available until launch of course many
application sets will work with the
iPhone will also work with the iPad so
what do you guys think about the iPad
personally I'm very excited about it I
think it's going to be a pretty good
sort of couchsurfing device
certainly not gonna replace anybody's
laptop one thing they didn't mention was
file storage if I use the iWork
application I create a word document or
I work document I create an edit and
make it
perfect how am I going to save that to
my device is the storage their feed of
the 32 16 or 64 gig is that just for
audio is that just for movie is that
just for books or prankster actual files
on it that really has yet to be seen of
course it will sync with iTunes put all
your content over including all your
movies there will be a version of iTunes
that'll ship with it be able to download
TV movies and music right over Wi-Fi or
the 18 t 3G network if you opt for that
version you know I think this is going
to disappoint a lot of people there were
so much promise what the tablet was
gonna do my person we felt we're gonna
see some sort of magazine subscriptions
integrated that we didn't see that and
the text interface is just an on-screen
keyboard essentially what we have is a
bigger thinner iPod Touch no mention of
phone call connectivity but I would
assume that you go to download the Skype
application and make phone calls using
the built-in microphone for that so
there would be calling I suppose over
voice over IP that point seven inches is
a very nice screen you've gotten to Best
Buy or local retailer you've seen
tension netbooks you're just going to
see what the size is going to be doesn't
look relatively thin nice easy just look
into a bag course has an accelerometer
so you can rotate any direction you want
you can edit your pictures sort of right
on the device and sync them up over
Wi-Fi if you use a Mac or PC I'm pretty
curious what you guys think about the
iPad you excited you're not excited you
care not care are you going to buy one
if you are going to buy one with your
version and we guys stated the
TechnoBuffalo for all of the iPad
updates they have a ton of videos coming
up and a lot of coverage nothing was
mentioned about iPhone OS 4.0 or any
sort of new iPhone or Mac updates it was
just on the tablet
hope you guys enjoyed I'm John renter
and I'll see in the next video bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
