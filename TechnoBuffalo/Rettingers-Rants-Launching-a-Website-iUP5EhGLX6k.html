to you by shutterstock.com welcome back
to another episode of renter's rants I'm
your host Jon wrenches the show where I
rant and rave on anything from the web
world of technology and sometimes a
little bit outside of it this week's
topic kind of falls right in between
we're gonna talk about launching a
website since it's fresh in my mind hole
this is renters rants let's go ahead and
get started so this video is being
filmed on the tenth of December which is
also the day that we relaunched
TechnoBuffalo com what we're sort of
named TechnoBuffalo 3 or TV three-point
oh one of those two so it's really fresh
on my mind all the trials and
tribulations it takes to launch a
website whether it's a large 11 much
larger than TechnoBuffalo and smaller or
you know just in between like we are
there's so much work if you ever
considered starting a blog or wanting to
launch a blog to go along with YouTube
videos listen up from somebody who has
walked that path definite things you're
going to want to keep in mind so let me
tell you a little story this is when we
first tried to launch TechnoBuffalo back
in end of 2010 it was like December ish
I had just quit my job I was focusing on
the YouTube in technobuffalo full-time
and we are getting ready to push the
sucker live it was early December I used
every outlet i had to promote this
technobuffalo thing it was coming nobody
knew what it was we'd kept everything
secret and finally I was telling
everybody on twitter on facebook on
youtube on this day this time
technobuffalo gonna be live go check it
out I put all my name reputation behind
it we tried to launch technobuffalo they
tried for a good reason and within 45
seconds the site crashed and didn't
crash because we had so much traffic the
server's we had should have more to be
able to take care of it it crashed
because of awful code and because i had
no idea how to build and run a website
at the time we had our server was
running on windows we left things wide
open we had infinite loop codes that
causes servers just completely crash it
was a total disaster trying to launch a
site I had no idea what I was doing
and it really showed when the site
launch took us over for months and about
sixty percent of our startup capital to
get the site back up and running was a
huge pain in the butt coincidentally
those you guys follow me on Twitter no I
have insomnia it was during the initial
launch technobuffalo and developed my
lack of sleep habit my insomnia before I
could fall asleep anywhere I had
backpack to you mainland China and
literally fell asleep on trains in China
now I can't fall asleep my own bed with
a noise maker on and a fan ought to save
my life so there you go so flash forward
now at the TechnoBuffalo three-point oh
we've learned quite a bit it is really
hard to launch a website now there are
plenty of third parties out there you
can use to launch a blog on sites you
know and trust you know blogspot things
like that are great ways to get a site
up and running you not to go through
some of the hassle that we did I think
you're going to maybe have a lower
traffic site those are great options in
fact we initially launched before every
jump TechnoBuffalo we had John for
lakers calm that was run off a blogspot
it worked great but if you want to say
it's gonna give you more flexibility you
can control everything on that you've
got sort of complete control over you're
gonna want to create your own website to
come just a huge hassle I gotta make
sure you've got a developed let you
trust or you better learn some crazy
HTML ruby-on-rails and all kinds of
other coding languages that really meant
nothing to me a few years ago and I
certainly know very very little about
them so you have to find great people
and certainly something that we have
right now fortunate to have incredible
people working for techno but was able
to help us get live but our launch of
the 10th was actually supposed to be two
weeks earlier in november i ran into
bugs and issues and weren't able to get
the site live in time according to my
initial calendar so when we launched
last night I didn't say a word to
anybody I didn't say a word to the
public because it decided crash or gone
down what it looked super bad on us so
we launched it very quietly way to make
sure this site worked now you put up in
an ounce of the daily today over here we
are live so definitely something to keep
in mind now if you've gotten past all
those issues your site's live and it's
working you got to put content on your
blog and putting caught on your blog can
be an interesting endeavor you might
think to yourself self I could write a
lot of blog posts
hey I have a lot of opinions about tech
or food or how much you love the galaxy
camera for example whatever it might be
I you think that you can do that every
day every day though gets to be a little
bit tedious day after day after day
trying to write content and only write
content bright good content provocative
content content that spell attractin has
limited typos as you can certainly being
close to real-time news it's very hard
to totally eliminate that but to keep in
mind make sure you're the dedication to
do it if you want to hire staff or get
staff or do it you got to go through and
vet people you got to manage people can
become very tedious so if you're
considering saying okay I run a YouTube
channel it's quasi successful I want to
branch out to the tech side really give
it some good thought now I'm not saying
that you can't be successful doing it
certainly you can oh it's oftentimes a
lot more work more difficult than you
might expect now for me the journey has
been more than worth it I wouldn't trade
anything that I've learned launching
TechnoBuffalo 12 we actually at the
launch checking a buffalo 2.5 but it
didn't go out and now TechnoBuffalo 3 I
wouldn't trade any of that experience
for really anything in the world I am so
proud of the site I'm so proud of the
staff I'm can't believe that we've got a
portal to share our opinions with the
world but it's been a tough road on a
spinning road rival learned quite a bit
I've grown as a manager as a writer as a
developer tiny little bit over the
course of the years and it's been just
an incredible experience so if you guys
are thinking about going that road you
know heed my warning give it some second
thought evaluate how much your time how
much time you have evaluate whether or
not you're gonna try and just cram as
many ads you can in there whether or not
you want to be the void of ads whatever
it might be just give it some thought so
I think a quick made from talking about
blogs to talk about blogs and videos if
you're thinking about starting your own
blog thinking about starting your own
YouTube channel you are going to need
stock images because articles come up
video topics come up left and right and
you need something fresh to make sure
the audience knows what you've got if
you need to get stuck imagery the folks
at shutterstock.com are the place to go
shutterstock.com is the only place to go
and looking for stock photos vectors
illustrations and video clips you can
sign up for large image packs multi
subscriptions just grab a sin
image for blog or mock-up you can offer
enhanced license access in case you want
to print out an image or get it screen
down a t-shirt so shutterstock makes it
easy to pay one price you get hi-res you
have to worry about being nickel and
dying if you want super high-resolution
images they just make it nice and easy
for you so head on over to
shutterstock.com or install their ipad
app to get started no credit card needed
find images you want use offer code
techno 12 to get thirty percent off any
package so again go to shutterstock.com
enter code techno 12 and again thirty
percent off any package make it pretty
easy get all your images SEC your blog
