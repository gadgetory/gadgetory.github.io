give some impressions on the brand new
macbook air that was announced today at
macworld first of all freakin sweet they
got something that small I mean when you
pulled it out of the envelope the manila
envelope I was shocked it's very
impressive that they got something like
that crammed into such a small package
first I'll talk about some of the pros
of it I haven't seen one yet in person
i'm going to go the apple store tomorrow
and try and grab some shots and you know
get those up on the website if they have
it at john for lakers blogspot com but
you know first time the pros I mean
thing is really tiny I think it's
perfect for road warriors people that
are traveling a lot and students have to
carry a computer you know to and from
class for size and weight it doesn't
look like it can be beat at all I mean
there's there's nothing on the market
like that and the fact that you can even
still use bootcamp and run a windows on
it to you know there's there's no reason
for people not to pick it up especially
those that even those that don't like
Mac os10 as nice alternative on the
downside though it's certainly not a
desktop replacement like the macbook can
be and certainly the macbook pro firstly
having only one USB port can be a
problem I know you can use a hub but
oftentimes that's a pain no firewire
ports make it a little difficult to
backup large data I know they announced
the time capsule but that's another cost
you have to add on to buy if you want to
use you know the wireless time machine
so that's one downside the lack of ports
the next downside is the lack of actual
physical built-in optical drive I know
that there is an attachment they release
which is great they need to do people
still like having an optical drive but
I'm not so sure that I by the virtual
optical drive that they have that you
can use on a PC or or anything so what
that means essentially is if you have
another computer in your house with an
optical drive like a desktop or
something yawn your same network you can
install a little bit of software on it
and your mac book air will recognize
that computers optical drive and accuse
it to install programs that we need a CD
it's a great idea but you know and maybe
it works again I haven't tried it but I
think people still are going to miss
actually having a drive on their
computer especially the less tech-savvy
that may not know how to set up that
virtual optical drive may be a problem
so some quick impressions are thoughts
that being said if I didn't have a
macbook pro I would probably try and buy
one of those MacBook Airs really really
really nice some of the other other
downsides are very small hard drive
certainly you can't go into double
digits yet and probably the biggest
downside of the computer is nothing is
user accessible or replaceable your
battery goes to gotta send it back to
apple it can't replace it yourself you
want a bigger hard drive you can't
replace it yourself you want to add more
RAM can't replace it yourself I believe
you do give Apple credit though Apple
credit they did give two gigabytes of
RAM which would be plenty which is nice
and they are claiming at the replace a
battery for I believe 125 bucks which is
not terribly bad and they did give it a
decent hard drive I believe it 80 gigs
for the 1.8 inch drive so it did give a
decent specs but not being able to
replace it yourself down the road is
potentially problematic but again like I
said if I had the option probably pick
one up myself but you know I can't
justify can't justify the cost we have a
macbook pro but what we'll try to do is
get one of our users to do an unboxing
for you up on up on YouTube and John for
lakers dot blog spot.com try and get
that up there too anyway guys want to
know your impressions on the mac macbook
air what you guys think of it are you
guys going to be buying one it's
something that interests you you don't
let us look at us and let me know what
you guys think I'm always interested
anyway guys and dot technology King this
video was for you hope you guys have a
good afternoon day or evening wherever
you are it is late here in California I
just got home I'm having dinner
