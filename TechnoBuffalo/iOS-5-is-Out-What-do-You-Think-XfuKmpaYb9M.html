is going to be the last time you're
going to have to plug in your device and
download the operating system cuz you're
gonna be able to do it over the air from
here on out so with iOS fire going to
get a ton of new stuff including new
notification center with stuff and
notifications and things that move in a
sort of widget way very Android esque

Twitter notifications so hooray for that

new features you're gonna get the Wi-Fi
sync that i mentioned lock screen

down to CTA to check out some new
gadgets so are you guys gonna download
iOS 5 you excited not excited you care
do not care also ipod touch users you
can download as well i fail to mention
it it's available so go do that plug
your phone in and check for updates if
you have itunes open and it says no
update available try quitting iTunes and
restarting it I've been using the gold
master for about a week and it works
it's pretty much exactly the same iOS
you've known to love or hate with a few
new added features i am happy to see I
message though so I can now use it with
other folks that have iOS 5 installed on
their phones and I can do weird stocking
things like see if they've read it and
replied and all kinds of other I message
e stuff that's probably the thing I'm
most excited about for obviously we've
got iCloud and all that other goodness
I'm rambling but you know what are you
gonna do it's funny iOS 5 comes out
today that rim is having another outage
which is multiple multiple many many
outages so I am for the time being not
