my favorite phones of really ever in the
HTC one in stock Android you get this
guy the HTC one google edition ready to
be unboxed and fondled with my modeling
fingers let's go ahead and take a look
at the HTC one google edition so here
we've got the HTC One Play edition the
box looks very similar to what we saw
off with the HTC One carriers except
they've changed the picture we've got
that red stock Android background I
believe this is going to be running for
point-to-point to at least the samsung
galaxy s4 play edition was something
else really new here all the specs are
exactly the same the same Qualcomm
Snapdragon 600 1.7 gigahertz we've got a
32 gigabyte version I believe that's the
only storage capacity that it's going to
come in everything else is exactly the
same for ultrapixel camera we do have
boom sound on here which is sort of one
of the HTC features that remain other
than that I to stock Android through and
through i loved the HTC One and I love
stock Android so be very fun to sort of
put those two together on CI performs so
we got the plastic off this box and I
should say that both of these guys are
available now of this and the samsung
galaxy s4 I'll go ahead and pull that
off we've presented with the HTC One
pull this out same phone push off the
side for just a minute so you also we're
going to have in the box we've got same
stuff we had the carrier versions you've
got a charging cable got some headphones
with red sure beats earbuds on him I've
got a wall work sim removal tool and
that is it no battery because the
battery is built in and some that to HTC
stickers to show your HTC love go ahead
take a look at the device i've been
using HTC one is my daily driver and I
really liked sense 5 it's actually on
the first carrier or manufacture skins
rather and I really enjoyed using almost
preferred over stock Android but I'm
really excited to take a look at this
guy so there's how it looks like on the
back HTC no carrier logo either here is
the 18
version I did a really nice job for
keeping it very subtle just a little 18t
globe down below rather than that no
discernible differences here the same
button layout that we had on every other
device if you've got the volume rocker
up and down back and home-button know
many button much do you want to push at
HTC it's nothing boom sounds a
combination of those two speakers and
proprietary software still have Beats
Audio here you've got your chardon singh
cable microphone 3.5 millimeter headset
jack power and lock button which is also
a ir blaster coincidentally enough let's
go ahead and power this sucker on and
take a look at stock android on the HTC
One yeah alright so here we are looking
at stock Android on the HTC One I
haven't done anything here other than
just really turned on and tell it I
don't want to put in my google
information right now let's take a look
at the settings we'll go ahead open that
sucker up I know Google so no carrier
apps here at all no Google Wallet
support either which is kind of
interesting that didn't support it from
a carrier versions and I thought maybe
it might support it here certains got
the NFC and capabilities for it but no
dice go to Settings scroll down to the
bottom about my phone android 4.4 point
to point to I thought maybe 4.3 might
sneak on this guy but no dice and you
can tell there's no HTC Sense on here at
all those easy that we're hoping that
maybe they did something with that HTC
logo it is still just a button other
than that it is sort of stock Android as
Google intended nothing giant here not
to see the story isn't the hardware
though obviously it's the software
unlocked bootloader and the rest so I'm
really excited to test this out and see
how if I prefer the stock android
version versus the sense fibers anything
you guys want to see be sure to let us
know we'll do a full review to recap on
everything I'm nice to see all the
stocks if you're including photos here
now on a HTC One which you had never
seen before sarnia guys anything else in
particular that you want to know be
surely doing the comments down below
