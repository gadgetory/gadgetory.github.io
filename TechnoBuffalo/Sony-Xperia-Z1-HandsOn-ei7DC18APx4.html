covering Aoife and i have the sony
xperia z1 this is brand new phone it's
beautiful it's a 5-inch screen and this
is a 1080p screen 16 gigs of internal
storage you got microSD slot available
on the side right here there's your
sleep and power button right there it's
not exactly the easiest thing ever i do
know that you know you have to be pretty
precise with this button and then of
course you have your your volume rocker
here which is a little bit small again
and then you have a dedicated camera
button always nice to see on a phone and
that's actually the one thing that makes
this phone so amazing this is a 20.7
megapixel camera when we're going to
take a picture with it in a second but
it's very very nice I've been messing
around with it for the last few minutes
just so you guys know the back of this
phone is going to pick up fingerprints
like you wouldn't believe it took me a
good like two minutes to clean the back
of this and it's already fingerprinted
up again I got to tell you the operating
system on this two point three gigahertz
quad-core processor is running on a
Qualcomm chip this thing screaming fast
I mean you could just flip through this
stuff really quickly and it is I mean
it's not messing around I feel like this
is probably the fastest android OS
iteration with a skin that I've seen
here the show thus far it is in fact
running Android 4.2 point2 so not quite
the most recent version of Android not
quite 4.3 but you know you take what you
can get guys beggars can't be choosers
and honestly for point-to-point do is
pretty darn good let's check out the
camera real quick so if you long press
the camera button you can go ahead and
do that so I'm gonna actually take a
picture of the ceiling overall a really
really quick phone i mean like i said
this thing is just it moves very quickly
it's so snappy so smooth i really really
love it the form factors cool of course
you have the playstation integration
here different sony apps playstation
mobile xperia privileged xperia lounge
sony obviously offering a lot of
different proprietary apps walkman
there's a
we haven't seen in a million years
really great i love this sort of sidebar
here for the app drawer which is really
nice generally speaking job well done
for sony i mean this is just really
quick so we'll be bringing you more from
the show floor we will absolutely be
