TechnoBuffalo here I've been using the
qwerty pack in blackberry q10 for the
better part of four days and I want to
share my experiences with you it's not a
full review but I have learned a lot
about the phone let's go ahead and start
talking so here is the qwerty rockin
blackberry q10 so I'm using the phone
for about four and a half days which for
me is not enough time to do a full
review i'll do a for review and about a
week when I flick i know the phone
inside and out but I've got a lot of
first impressions I don't want to share
with you guys I know this phone is
coming to all US carriers very soon so
let's run through what the phones got
let's start with the reason that you're
here probably watching this video and
that is these four rows down below the
screen that keyboard so I go ahead and
show you an example of how well the
keyboard works well you can't really
tell but it works great it feels really
nice to type on a physical keyboard it's
really impressive so I've got it set to
sort of suggests words you can turn that
on or off if you use the old blackberry
keyboard the 9900 it doesn't have that
sort of smiley face look but the keys
are absolutely outstanding it feels
really good there's a very hard clickety
clack feel that you just don't get
elsewhere so you're probably saying
what's the big deal about the keyboard
virtual keyboards were fine blackberry
z10 had a good keyboard and that is true
this phone is running OS 10.1 which as
well you get a few things that you can't
do with the z10 by having this full
physical keyboard for example I could
type text and I could text say text
rebecca von text my wife and they'll
protect message to her things you can't
get and you don't have that keyboard
sort of always present same thing with
call i'm not going to show you it
because it's gonna pull in all kinds of
numbers here but it does work very well
on emails you can go to top and the
bottom by hitting shortcut so it gives
you access to bit more shortcuts some
gripes i've had with it so it's
obviously a very gesture based OS no
matter where you are you always gotta do
a gesture swipe up to go home so you
swipe up and you go home you don't have
any sort of bezel here so you're almost
have to start your gesture at the
keyboard i do at the t and then do my
swipe up it's a little bit weird second
i know this is a 720 x 720 screens i
mean it's a perfect square but still
seems very weird to me not be able to
goin doesn't have
green rotate and I know it would make no
sense for to rotate because it's exactly
the same thing it's just weird to hold
the phone and not have it move but i'm
sure i will get very used to that and
while we're here on the browser i'm
still very impressed with the browser on
blackberry 10 you still have the option
to to turn on flash if you want which is
not something that you get really very
easily now on other operating systems
especially since adobe stop supporting
it on android well you can still get
installed I just worked very well it's
been them a very impressive browser
hello every time I see the icon for the
browser I still sort of think it's gonna
be a bad experience just from old
blackberry os's but this one works
really well let's talk a little bit
about blackberry world and the App Store
it is still not overly populated they're
not that many apps here but it's kind of
a double-edged sword here so on one end
do I knock it if you're not having that
many amps on the other hand it is
ridiculously easy to side live
applications on here we just ran an
article on how to do it using only
chrome and it's really easy so you get x
two things that you wouldn't get X 2
otherwise it's sort of paramount among
them at least for me would be that guy
Instagram is now living on here if you
want to know how to do this we'll put a
link down below to walk you through how
to sideload other stuff you can file it
pretty much any Android app to be
converted to have a dot B AR as the
extension and that's what runs on
blackberry 10 I've got speed test here
though it looks a little weird some of
the apps obviously don't work perfectly
or look perfect but this is sort of gets
shrunk a little bit and these icons show
up over those but it does work and it
works as well as it does anywhere else
other apps web site loaded on here some
of my favorites I've got google
navigation which is awesome sugar sing
for me is huge the full dropbox app i'll
go out of the box it does come with a
dropbox connect and I've got some sort
of weird version of Google Maps called
GPS plus I haven't really played around
that much with it but side loading is
super easy so yeah there aren't a mini
apps the other hand it's super easy to
get them I mean ridiculously easy now
you have to worry about anything like
rooting or having a jailbreak I mean
almost like the matter of plugging your
phone setting an IP address and putting
in a password and that is about it so
one of the issues I had with the z10 i
still have here that's with the dialer
two strikes me as strange to have a
dialer as app I just
it's very very odd to me to have a
dialer as an application I wish I know
inherently it's an app and everything
released for most phones it's always
running the backgrounds there's that
instant load it just feels like it's
always when I want to run it that I
gotta wait a second to 4 to load up and
pull in it just weird I got used to it
on the z10 I'm sure get you sit on the
q10 but just a peculiar tea for me as
well let's talk about build quality a
little bit this phone feels ridiculously
awesome in the hand it doesn't have sort
of the chrome accents on the side that
the 9900 did but the phone just feels
really good and I don't know what is
about it's not a really heavy doesn't
feel all that solid it just feels great
perhaps the soft touch back it's sort of
a weave glass thing it's probably when
the best feeling phones with the
removable back that I have ever seen so
I really good Blackbird credit their
engineers did a really nice job putting
this phone together obviously spent a
long long time with it the keyboard is
absolutely outstanding if I was going to
pick a blackberry I would probably pick
the q10 to use just as I love this
physical keyboard the screen being only
720 and I say only like six months ago
that would have been out of this world
awesome but I've gotten used to 1080p
phones and a 720 doesn't look so awesome
to me but that's just me if you're
coming from a whole generation phone you
probably have noticed it or it might not
even be an issue for you I believes for
me i'm sort of keenly aware of the
resolution on the phone but you know i
use and also the same guy uses an ipad
meeting doesn't mind the lower
resolution on the mini versus obviously
the retina version so i would definitely
get used to that as well other than that
is pretty much z10 through and through
the camera software is the same if i'll
take a picture you just little tap you
on the screen you can do that and get a
ton of options in here after things you
can set a front-facing camera you can
see Ralph doing the filming there hi
Ralph but everything here is pretty much
z10 specs of it are exactly the same
down to the ram and processor and phone
is very very quick don't get to cut up
though in that it's only a dual-core and
their quad-core an octa-core out phone
works is very very well and QX is really
optimized for this phone and it does not
at any point feel under power to me at
all overall i really liked the phone i
really enjoyed the phone battery life
has actually been pretty solid call
quality has been fair
good receptions been awesome I do want
to test a little bit more and see if I
can get used to it see I continue to use
it as my daily driver and I'll get back
to you guys when I do that anything that
you want to see me cover though on the
full review please leave your comments
down below I love to hear from you again
please give the video a thumbs up I'd
most definitely appreciate it i'm jon
rettinger from technobuffalo i'll see
you next video
