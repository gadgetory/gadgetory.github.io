technobuffalo and we are here in sunny
San Francisco taking a first look at the
1+2 we did a full hands-on if in check
that out will link to it right here but
I thought it'd be fun to do a real quick
family tree so here we've got the two it
subtract one and you've got the one here
is the 1 plus 1 so 1 plus 2 is going to
ship with the same sandstone back now
that we see here at the original one
plus we have five from color options to
choose from so I thought people would
want to see the difference of the phones
actually are to go ahead and flip around
you're going to have the same 5.5 inch
screen size on both they are 1080p oh
this one's going to get significantly
brighter for better outdoor visibility
and of course you can tell i'm talking
about the oneplus 2 because it's got
that capacitive fingerprint sensor and a
home button right there other than other
notable additions of course you've got
four gigs of ram living here in the
oneplus 2 vs I mean it sounds weird to
say but only three gigs of ram found in
the one plus one which as I read the
specs out still is a very nicely SPECT
phone 30 100 million power battery here
a slightly larger 3300 million power
battery going to be found in the 1+2
same Snapdragon family lines here got
the 801 versus the 810 here in the
oneplus 2 s is clocked at 2.4 gigahertz
this one's going to be clocked at 1.8
giga hertz but octo-core so if you flip
these phones over on their side big
differences here the volume button up
and down now live on the right-hand side
of one plus two right below that the
power button on the left hand side where
the volume button was on the oneplus one
you have a profile switcher on the
oneplus suit on mute all your
notifications single sim on the oneplus
one now with dual sims on the oneplus
shoe one team guys it should real quick
first look what difference between these
two phones were decided which one you
want to pick up I will say the original
one plus one still feels nice in the
hand but the aluminum body on the 1+2
certainly feels a bit more premium
anything feels a bit more modern of
course one of the biggest difference is
here is on the bottom micro USB versus
USB type-c I which one plus is going to
be selling on their website for cost I
just around five bucks so great way to
get a cheap USB see cable also you can
see a slight curve to the back here our
just one has sort of a more gradual
curve to it and what do you guys think
you can pick up
I use maybe one plus one for a great
discount or you're going to wait to try
and get an invite for the oneplus
wheeled here look to your thoughts on
until next time Jen Ranger from
TechnoBuffalo see you guys next video
bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
