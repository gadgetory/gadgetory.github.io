are we the same person bull yeah but uh
you know what they call a dual user you
know we use a both operating systems hmm
while we're here technobuffalo then hmm
well i can only mean one thing really
time for a battle stop stop stop I know
what you guys are thinking man mac vs pc
this is just going to be some stupid
fanboy troll bait dribble it's going to
be absolutely worthless to everyone and
what is this 1993 come on Mac versus PC
this is an argument that was played out
a decade ago I got to tell you guys when
John first asked me to do this series
that is exactly what I thought but then
I started thinking about a little more
and you know since Apple switched to
using intel chips you can now boot camp
in the windows on a mac and you can take
part Smith for a pc and turn it into a
hackintosh the argument nowadays is
really much more windows versus OS 10
and as someone who has used both os's
every single day for the past 10 years
or so I gotta tell you there are some
really great things about both and some
things that really suck about both so I
thought for anyone out there may be
sitting on a fence and considering
switching either way it'd be really cool
if someone just made an honest objective
head-to-head comparison of the two os's
so they can actually make an informed
decision now I know everyone out there
in TechnoBuffalo is really going to
leave constructive and mature comments
on these videos I've got nothing but
faith in you guys um but for this first
one what I'd really like to see is you
know if you are a Windows user go ahead
and leave something about OS 10 that you
think is cool and if you're not in user
leave something about windows that you
may be like to see incorporated into the
mac operating system and that's really
going to help me out as i build this
series so I can kind of see the things
people are thinking out there and
so yeah I'm not invaluable I can make
mistakes too so I'd love to get kind of
a consensus as we get things started and
hopefully this series is actually going
to be useful to people and not just some
fanboy nonsense that's not going to do
anybody any good so that's it for the
intro guys I'll see you guys very soon
for the first round of our head to head
comparison later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
