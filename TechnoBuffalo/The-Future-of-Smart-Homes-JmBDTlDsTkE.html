especially over the years spent on these
crazy flagship products but I think one
of the coolest things about the show
that doesn't get the cover deserves are
these big paradigm shifts these things
that happen that change the industry and
change tech and I think in turn kind of
changed consumers and I think the smart
home is one of them we've heard the term
smart home for years now we've seen
selective smart home products but
finally we're at the shifts or the smart
home like the vision of everything
connected inside of your house is
becoming possible so I figured that was
a sit and it's like kind of houses set
up and show you what the vision for the
connected home is and beyond that what
you can do with your home right now and
some stuff that like maybe might be
coming I so I am at the Bosch booth in
CES 2018 I think they have one of the
most comprehensive smart home visions
what that means for a smart home is
obviously all of your devices are
connected that connectivity goes with
you whether you are on the road whether
you're traveling for work the way you're
sitting on your couch using your voice
you can control what's in your home and
I think more importantly make your home
work for you so obviously you can use
your voice to change the thermostat
change the temperature up and down that
stuff that we've seen use your voice to
control 360-degree cameras and then hide
that camera so it's not on all the time
having things like smart switches and
smart outlets they can plug anything
into and something that takes them
lion obviously beyond that using your
phone it's using an app to control
everything in your home but there are
also times when you're not near an Alexa
or when stable device you don't have
your phone with you you want to think
sort of tangible to control all of these
things it's up the call to twist about
right on your wall and magnetically you
can turn pull it off you can physically
see all the things Eve patrol in your
home control them move them change
temperatures move cameras closed doors
put it right back on the wall and you're
good to go
so my vision of Smart Hub I think it's
twofold to make my life easier and to
solve problems so behind me we've got
the rock star it's a robot vacuum from
Bosch so we've seen robot vacuums now
for a super long time but this does a
few new things that we haven't seen
before so first it'll use lasers to map
out your house and you can set sort of
go or no-go zones on my house I've got
pets and their food and water bowls
around the floor I've got robot vacuums
that I set to go and end up just pushing
them all over the place so I could set a
no-go area that's kind of cool gonna of
course you can control it also from your
phone so all that stuff are things that
exist but it wouldn't be CES without
sort of concept stuff that we might see
like we've seen smart lamps before you
can turn them on from your phone with
this lamp as a projector the projected
image down and all stirred into a
touchscreen we've got it set up to even
play games to see the air temperature
project anything to see your doorbell
that's another way to interact with
surfaces it's obviously being the Kinect
at home kitchens gonna be a big part of
it all of your stuff they use at home
can be connected things like your oven
your coffee machine even your dishwasher
you can be notified via if to set up a
custom pattern when a dishwasher is done
or the dryer cycles done flash the
lights or play your favorite song
another way you could make your house
smart
so there's a lot of cool potential for
the Kinect at home a lot of stuff is
here now and a lot of stuff I think it's
so coming that future things were
waiting for things like smart glass and
smart mirrors serve on the cusp of a
coming reality but Bosch has here and
now is absolutely awesome so if you want
to know how to never search for a
parking spot again hit the link down
below got a longer cut that's gonna
explain that a ton of other cool ways to
use the Internet of Things to make your
life easier
hope you guys enjoy it of course
subscribe it the belt icons get notified
when new CES videos are coming your way
until next time I'm John Ranger from
TechnoBuffalo and I legit feel like I'm
standing in the future</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
