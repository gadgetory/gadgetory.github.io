TechnoBuffalo and we're really excited
to bring you the unboxing of the Zune HD
a device that we've been waiting for for
a very long time
this device is aimed right at the ipod
touch and it brings some things that the
ipod touch doesn't have it has the super
fast and Vidya Tegra platform which
should provide awesome graphics
it also has HD radio support which
pretty much no mobile devices out there
has right now it also has an OLED screen
which should mean better power
consumption and a really really crisp
display the blacks are super black on an
OLED screen and colors really pop it
also can do 720p output in terms of
video so if you have movies on the Zune
HD you can take it to your friend's
house plug it in to a a flat panel with
an HDMI cable and watch a video in true
high-definition so let's get to the
unboxing very small box Zune HD let's
take a look around the box kind of a
feature list here Wireless and as Wi-Fi
media player music HD radio video
multi-touch has a web browser like the
iPod Touch and you can also get games on
it in the future they're gonna have 3d
games to start it's going to launch with
a few kind of basic games so let's get
inside the package
Wow gorgeous display on the front here
we're gonna put the device to the side
for a second see what else we get in the
box
zoom everywhere it's kind of dump these
things out and this probably talks about
the Zune Pass and using the zoom
software we'll get into that later of
course 14 days of free music you can try
the Zune pass for free for 14 days
very nice download as much music as you
like it looks like we have some
connectors in here usb on the right and
headphones on the left so we can take
this out
welcome to Zune HD in other languages
Zune product guide okay and we've got
the USB cable headphones with a variety
of colors standard stuff here well let's
take a look at what we've been waiting
for the device itself okay so here we
have the device we have some notes on
the front here download the latest
software to your PC from Zoo net slash
setup the devices don't come with
software which is a very interesting
move something we haven't seen yet it
probably saves Microsoft a little bit of
production time on each device and thus
lowers the cost which you know I really
don't mind I'm gonna plug it in anyway
to my computer so if it's an extra two
minutes on my end to to put on the
software it's not a big deal and it says
charge your Zune using the supplied
cable for at least 30 minutes before use
got it let's take out the device Wow
this device is very small very very
light in hand gorgeous 3.3 inch display
let's see what the back looks like wow
look at that brushed metal with the
screw look very industrial looking
gorgeous design fits very nicely in hand
the edges are super slim like the iPod
Touch doesn't feel thick at all it's
very small feels like a media player
feels like it could be a cell phone too
bad it's not and we've got one button in
the front here let's do some concise
comparisons okay so here's the Zune HD
next to the iPod Touch 3rd generation
probably its closest competitor the iPod
Touch has a 3.5 inch screen the Zune HD
has a
three point three inch to screen they've
different resolutions on the Zune HD
it's 480 down and 272 across whereas on
the iPod Touch it's a little bit higher
3 480 down that is and 320 across I did
the calculations and the pixel density
on the Zune HD is actually slightly
higher by just 2 PPI which really
doesn't make a difference at the end of
the day let's see how they look in terms
of thickness the ipod touch definitely
feels thinner though I wouldn't be
surprised if the dimensions from the
very edge of the ipod touch to the top
is the same as on the Zune HD it's just
a matter of how they make the sides I
have to say that the ipod touch feels
higher quality in hand probably because
more metal has been used on the device
than on the Zune HD let's see how it
looked next to the Samsung omnia - the
only other device that I can think of
that's available to the mass market that
has the OLED screen and let's take a
look at it next to the HTC touch
diamond2
a lot of people said that HTC would be
making the Zune HD because they look so
similar but looking at them closer up
and not in pictures they're really not
that similar so we can kind of debunk
that myth that they are based off one
another and something I just know it's
kind of funny here it says hello from
Seattle of course Microsoft is based out
of that area here's the power button on
the top let's see what happens
okay we got the Zune logo this device is
so slim and sleek looking it's pretty
amazing little Zune animation kind of
got the spectrum of color wow maybe it
does have software unless this is a
startup video okay it looks like it does
have some software on it but of course
we're going to connect this to a
computer update to the latest software
and we're gonna take a look at
everything about the Zune HD we're gonna
take wow and here's a video playing
right now I can tell you that the
quality of the screen is insane it's
gorgeous the blacks are totally pitch
black it's not like a standard LCD on se
the iPod touch where it's kind of gray
but not quite black so we've got a lot
more coming up on the Zune HD follow us
on Twitter to find out when the next
video hits twitter.com slash
TechnoBuffalo we've got full comparisons
coming up with the ipod touch we're
gonna do software walkthroughs talk
about the applications that are on here
and so much more
we'll be back soon with more on the Zune
HD</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
