questions was asked to Buffalo i'm jon
rettinger let's get started first
question comes from at hits vara 51 who
asks what's going to be the next big
thing in tech next big thing attack and
mark this down right now live streaming
360 video but I think we're about two
generations away from seeing smartphones
have 360 cameras built into the phone I
think that's going to be the next big
giant thing that we're going to see some
might say vr DVR is going to be a huge
part of that but I think 360 cameras or
things are really going to change I
think the optics inside of smartphone
cameras are going to really start to
rival DSLRs in a few years at bigness
developer asks what are you do in your
free time Oh in my free time I've got a
two and a half year old and a three
month old so I'm a dad I love being a
dad I'm at home at the park usually
pushing Nate in the swings up to get out
to movies like to work out when I can go
for a run we have a look to go up the
house that I don't use nearly as much as
I should be I don't want to get back
into building pc's again I just wanna
start building some custom rigs like
start putting video games again to my
fingers are itchy and I want to play at
a fits G asks what are the best areas to
study in college to be a tech journalist
I'm interested in a career similar to
yours to be any kind of journalist tech
or otherwise take a writing intensive
course anything writing intensive
English comparative religion philosophy
whatever just write a lot also video is
being a huge part of journalism it's
going to be even bigger I think moving
forward so anything you can get you more
comfortable speaking in public I did
speech and debate and is gonna get you
talking try out for a play try to get a
radio show whatever you can do on campus
that gets you speaking in public when
the early things I did was necessarily
in college but just to get more
comfortable speaking was recording
myself actually reading dr. Seuss books
they're very wry me you can sometimes
stumble over yourself trying to do it
that was really helpful to get more
comfortable if you watch how it was my
earlier videos versus the later videos I
started to feel more confident on camera
and that's because I was hos reading dr.
Seuss at haizen badge asks the rumored
specs the one plus three exciting or
unnerving are they wet and rainy to say
zippy long term
whoo the one plus three makes me makes
me happy and my smartphone loving a
heart so the rumors are snapdragon 820
six gigs of ram qhd which is insane and
really high spec that sounds more like
the note 6 line specs than a one plus
but the killer for me is supposedly a
price point under four hundred dollars
so yes super jazzed up about the one
plus 3 1 plus 2 less so but 33 is the
key for me you see too much dr. Seuss
last question comes from the awesomely
named Jill acha focka who asks for John
how'd you get started getting those TV
appearances Oh sarah has don't know
myself and some of the other folks
second Buffalo will do CNBC will do fox
business talking about tech and earnings
that kind of stuff it happened a long
time ago you brought on a publicist try
to help get us out there more their
relationships with some of the producers
at these networks that's kind of what
started I had to do some regional stuff
to try and get a real people could be
familiar with me and how I sounded on
camera then I got one cmec appearance
and it kind of went from there thank you
guys for asking questions thank you guys
for watching and reading thank you guys
for overall just being awesome hope you
guys enjoy keep asking questions and you
guys want to know just shoot it my way
you can set it to me on Twitter on
Instagram on snapchat whatever they're a
lot of ways to get a hold of me until
next time John render from TechnoBuffalo
see you guys next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
