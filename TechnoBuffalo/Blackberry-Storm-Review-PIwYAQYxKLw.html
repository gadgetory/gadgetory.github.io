lakers calm with the review for you of
the blackberry storm for Verizon
Wireless I've had the phone since about
a week before it came out so I really
had a chance to get to use it I don't
know nuances of it and even upgrade the
firmware on it once it's really give its
sense of how the phone works and really
can give me a unbiased and relatively
thought out and thorough review on it so
I hope you guys enjoy first thing it's a
phone that's let's type of call quality
verizon's network at least by me is
fantastic it's certainly going to vary
by location but if you get good verizon
service you're going to be very happy
with the call quality on the phone I
heard no static or buzzing people on the
other end of the call reported no static
of buzzing either very clear is that it
almost sounded like i was on a landline
so kudos to verizon and blackberry for
that but that's probably not what you
here for and not what you're interested
in the storm for is called quality storm
does a lot of things and it's supposed
to do a lot of things so let's talk
about what it does well email is
fantastic you have the blackberry email
that you're used to on your curves your
bolds your pearls pro flips everything
does email fantastic exactly as
advertised it's a blackberry after all
email is certainly just phone strong
points now some of the concerns I have
with the phone they have become more and
more as problems as I continued use it
are actually the to touch mechanisms on
the phone so as I mentioned in my
overview actually it has a capacitive
touchscreens when you touch it registers
a click and then you have to have to
push in to use the function rubber
application you're using so it's
actually a double top jif to touch it
wants to select it and then push in dec
open the application now that's a little
bit iffy using applications throughout
the phone sometimes you only have to
touch it sometimes you have to click it
and if it comes a little bit unclear so
which applications you have to do which
with the big issue that i had with the
phone is actually when you're typing so
when you go to type in SMS
her an email pulls up a full keyboard
either our full keyboard rather and
landscape and a shirt type when it's up
in portrait mode now you can order the
type and I've shown this in numerous
videos and how to type on the blackberry
storm you have to actually push the keys
all the way in to type you have to wait
for the screen to pop back up so there's
a little bit of delay for typing and a
lot of people can type lightning fast on
their other blackberries whether it's
the bold or the curves whatever you're
not going to have as fast at typing it
certainly not going to be that accurate
compared to some other phones with
on-screen keyboards you can see what
letter you're typing meaning it will pop
up when have your finger over it not so
with this morning just get a little blue
color that hovers over the key and it's
often unclear what key you're pressing
so typing is extremely inaccurate when
using the full keyboard I found the only
way to get even a modicum of accuracy
was actually to use the suretype
keyboard because the keys are just
bigger but again not nearly as fast not
nearly as quick I tried typing the same
message she the suretype on the storm
and using the sure type on a blackberry
pearl flip with both similar keyboard so
I was able to type much much much
quicker on the pearl flip with an actual
tactile hardware keyboard that's
something definitely to keep in mind
internet browsing is something that
blackberry has really been working to
improve upon and they started their
biggest improvements with the blackberry
bold really being able to render full
HTML pages and this is another area
where the blackberry storm really does
shine is with web browsing you get full
robust HTML websites it does handle some
flash but not so much you can't view
youtube videos for example yet on it and
there isn't a dedicated YouTube player
like two are on some other windows
mobile phones or on an iPhone for
example so no YouTube videos on this yet
media on the phone handles media
spectacularly as far as viewing videos
screen as gorgeous as far as listening
to music you've got a 3.5 millimeter
headset jack which is little
hit it on the right hand side of the
device and can handle all those tasks
with relative ease so now to get some
more in the downsides the operating
system is extremely buggy it feels
almost as a rim was rushed to get this
to market before the holiday season they
fix some of the problems with the
software update but still things like
screen rotation aren't so quick
sometimes don't even register or
sometimes even too sensitive I feel
looking at the phone and just tilting it
back a little bit screen and roll tape
even right now it's not rotating back
you can see in the screen that's you can
actually a perfect example see long it
takes with the rotate back did you have
to shake it turn it again and then turn
it and then finally it rotates back
that's just one example of kind of how
how buggy and quirky this can be the
cliq keyboard is a very interesting and
unique approach to a phone but it
doesn't translate so well right now that
being said I think rim can really fix
the platform with software updates but I
don't think the phone is ready for prime
time right now you know like you just
saw screen rotation applications kill
load very slowly I've had numerous
crashes these are not things I'm
familiar with the blackberry
blackberries are known for their
stability the reliability and their
business workhorse and the storm just
doesn't have that same feeling that
seems to bility that other blackberries
do have like I said before I think it
can be fixed with software updates but
if you are thinking about getting a
storm I recommend holding off until you
know to or through software updates have
come down the line and it can really fix
it get another issue with the phone and
no people are reporting this and mass
amounts of the devices is the screen as
less responsive in the corners when you
go to click sometimes even register at
all which can be quite annoying because
sometimes you want to use the full area
of the screen especially for typing with
the full keyboard so I'm the letters are
in the bottom left or bottom right-hand
corner to the screen makes it quite
difficult when they're not gonna be
recognized there have been some sort of
fixes like putting a piece of paper
above the battery and things like that
those are things you should have to do
with the new phone especially a phone
that costs this much and this much for
service things like that should just
work out of the box a little
disappointed with the rim for that
now that being said I was really excited
about the phone I was you know really
hyped up about it I thought it was going
to be the first true you know iphone
killer I hate to mention the iphone in a
review here but died phone really set a
standard for touchscreen devices not it
was going to be the killer the one that
really was going to knock Apple down a
peg and really set weren't even verizon
up for the future you know with future
storm devices and they just haven't done
that yet you know it's if you're getting
a phone expecting it to to allow you
everything you wanted to do very well
the storm is really not for you I
recommend you look elsewhere now why
should you get this door well if you're
on verizon or I really want to switch to
verizon service and you have to have a
fully capable touchscreen email device
will let storm is really the only way to
go if you're on verizon and you want to
have a blackberry i still recommend
using the curve that they have on their
service or their world edition but if
you really need to have a full-featured
web browser and you're okay with the
quirks you know it's not going to work
perfectly you know you're gonna have
some troubles typing I know the software
hasn't been fixed yet then go ahead and
go up to storm but to me those are a lot
of compromises to make for a for a phone
no matter how much you might want it so
reasons not to get the storm don't get
the storm because you hate apple or
don't get this dorm because you hate the
iphone you want to make a stand against
it that's not a reason the phone is not
a political statement I've heard a lot
of people say i'm getting the storm
because i hate apple and you're left to
paint app we're allowed to dislike of
company or its products that's not a
reason to go ahead and get a device like
this it's an expensive piece of hardware
it's also two-year commitment you might
not be happy for two years using the
phone that is inherently buggy and very
well may not be fixed with software it's
just my speculation an opinion that
they're going to fix it but you know I
don't have any insider information on
that so don't get it because of that and
don't get it because you think it looks
cool or you think it looks fun because
you are going to be grossly disappointed
with the phone I can't tell you how many
times I've had to reset the device you
know you take it out your pocket you
show your friends gonna look how cool
I've got a blackberry storm that wears
off
click when you realize it takes 10
minutes type of text message or at least
type it properly it does have cut and
paste and mms some really cool things
that you know other phone may be missing
but it's still not enough to convince me
to use it as my primary device so guys
hope this was helpful hope I answered
some questions that you may have about
the blackberry storm check out my other
videos for some demonstrations some
browser comparisons i did a head-to-head
video with the iphone actually like the
two of them so you know ask any
questions that you'd like about the
storm be happy to answer them for you or
any other things that you'd like to see
happy to answer them for you as well
