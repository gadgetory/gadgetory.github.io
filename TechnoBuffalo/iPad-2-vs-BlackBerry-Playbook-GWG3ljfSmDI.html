TechnoBuffalo here back with another
eighth round tablet Smackdown this time
we've got Apple's iPad 2 is squaring up
against rims newcomer the playbook let's
go ahead and see who the winner is in
the interest of not making this a 45
minute epic unfortunately categories
have to be cut I picked the 8th that I
felt were most relevant to average
tablet users we're going to cover
browser screen text input apps OS design
camera and a potential so let's go ahead
and jump right into what I use tablets
for most the browser we've seen the
browser on the iPad 2 quite a bit I've
covered it ad nauseam on TechnoBuffalo
pitch to zoom the multi-touch
functionality works very well scrolling
is really smooth it's got a nice physics
engine so when you flick slowly it goes
slowly you click fast it goes fast very
rarely do you see the checkerboard
loading pattern
it just works very nicely it does not of
course have flash support the sort of
Apple's infamous I suppose now for that
so if you're looking at regular web
sites or html5 web sites you're gonna
get a great browsing experience if flash
is what you're looking for however is
going to be unviewable on the iPad to us
now let's move over to the playbook
let's go ahead and open this up
scrolling is also nice and smooth moves
with your finger physics engines quite
good pinch-to-zoom also works very well
and this is all doing that while Flash
content is running because the PlayBook
does show Flash content actually shows
it very nicely so I'll go ahead and hit
the tab browser here you get that
visualized look of the tabs so you can
actually see what you're jumping to I'll
go ahead and go to let's say my youtube
channel youtube.com slash John for
Lakers YouTube who's a course encoded in
flash and you can see that it will start
playing very quickly
ready to go I know it's a showing the
advertisement works very nicely actually
it's a pretty smooth implantation of
Flash it is a little bit choppy but it's
definitely watchable
if you go back again and start a hit
back tab icon you can also access the
Downloads folder which is quite nice you
can see what you download it you can get
access to all those files directly so
because of a very smooth rising
experience because that visualized have
the interface which I personally like
and because the ability to view your
downloads you browse around is going to
go to rinse play book alright so next
let's talk about what you're going to be
looking at when you're doing anything on
these devices the screen the screen on
the iPad 2 is 9 point 7 inches that's
diagonal with a resolution of 1024 by
768 it's got a very nice viewing angle
you can sort of view it from anywhere
you are at due to that IPS technology as
you can see there's a bit of reflection
so when you're looking at the screen in
direct sunlight you're gonna have a bit
of trouble trying to view it however
when you're not in direct sunlight
colors are gonna look bold blacks are
gonna look very dark taking a look now
at the rim playbook it's got a 7 inch
diagonal screen with a resolution of
1024 by 600 so again a very high
resolution screen this also has a very
nice viewing angle you can view it
really any direction you're also gonna
get that same glare unfortunately you're
gonna get indirect sunlight you're going
to get vibrant colors and you're also
gonna get very dark blacks the
difference between a nine point seven
the seven inch is really going to be a
matter of personal preference so that's
not going to factor in here whether you
want a larger tablet or a bit of a
smaller one both look very nice pictures
look really very pretty on each you can
see an image I took with the rear facing
camera here so this round is actually
going to be a draw so let's go ahead and
now talk about text input neither of
these have physical keyboards you're
gonna have to rely on your fingers and
the screen for your text input so let me
go ahead and jump into a notes
application here on the iPad - we've
seen this keyboard quite a bit it's
relatively nice and
easy-to-use portrait or landscape and
this is one instance where the screen
size really does come into play when
you're typing you get a close to
full-size keyboard here in landscape
portrait you can do the thumb typing
it's a little bit tough because the
screen is wider but it is definitely
usable when you push this over in
landscape cover the keyboard is a
pleasure to use alright so next let's
talk about the keyboard on the playbook
I'm using one of the bungled word
applications and we'll talk about that
when we get to apps let's go ahead and
bring that up you can see it right here
here is the obviously landscape keyboard
orientation go ahead and switch on over
to portrait it's more phone esque when
you're typing so it's like a baby phone
especially when it's in portrait in
landscape it's just big enough that you
can thumb type but it's not big enough
that you could type normally I like you
could with the iPad 2 the playbook does
have a very nice cut copy and paste
implementation I don't think it's as
elegant as what Apple offers but it
definitely works well you can select
text and you can move back and forth so
this is one instance I think where the
screen size and screen real estate
really does matter so text input is
going to go to the iPad 2 right now you
can't really do much for customization
or keyboards that may come at a later
time for the PlayBook wouldn't hold your
breath um being able to customize a
keyboard outside of other languages with
the iPad 2 all right next let's talk
about apps it's not really much to say
that hasn't already been said about the
App Store for the iPads robust there are
hundreds of thousands probably close to
millions of applications out there now
from games to enhancements the app store
in the app environment is very
impressive but it's also been around for
quite a while you're not gonna get that
many bundled apps on the iPad 2 you're
gonna get some camera applications like
FaceTime which you can use if you like
to video chat which is nice I can video
chat from iPad 2 to iPhone 4 or
Mack or any combination of those devices
you're also going to have some other
cool photo applications you're going to
get photo booth and the camera in there
you're going to access to iTunes in the
iBook store on the application
standpoint on the playbook this is where
things get a bit interesting so you do
have access to BlackBerry's app world
which is not that populated with
applications but that's started to be
expected since a tablet is quite new
I have applications that are in here
that were meant for a smaller screen
real estate you see on other BlackBerry
devices it's got a very nice clean
layout but there aren't that many apps
here what will be coming is Android app
support they haven't announced when
sometime in the summer that will
certainly do quite a number for apps for
the PlayBook I won't talk about that in
the potential that's going to be a
really really nice benefit to the
PlayBook but right now it's not here
also one of the glaring omission that
the PlayBook is a native mail and
calendar application instead what you
have to use if you want to look at your
mail is go ahead and open up right here
is just a shortcut to web-based emails
let's to take your right to Yahoo's
homepage hotmail homepage Gmail home
page or AOL's home page
unfortunately now you're gonna get some
nice bundled app so we're gonna get work
to go sheet to go and slideshow to go
start gonna get mobile office bundles in
here the bridge app is a nice additional
- I'm to tether a blackberry to the
playbook and use its data connection and
use its native apps but not here yet
the biggest omission and I can certainly
forgive a new platform for not having a
robust app store that's bound to happen
as developers get access to the API is a
little bit more and get their hands on
the devices that will certainly grow
what's really unforgivable though is the
omission of a mail and native calendar
application now ring the said that's
certainly coming and assume it's going
to be coming very soon but that doesn't
help push the side rumors that the
playbook was maybe rushed to market
releasing a device without the basic
functionality is a huge omission
really use the playbook for any terms of
business uses I know I like to take my
calendar with me anywhere I go and being
able to access that on my tablet is
almost a necessity now that might be
just unique to me but not having
calendar and not having a mail
application really is a big dent and the
reason I would only tell what so if you
couldn't guess this round is definitely
going to go to the iPad - all right so
next let's talk about the operating
system the iPad 2 is powered of course
by iOS and this is being powered II
maybe see me fiddle around with this
during the demo BlackBerry's new tablet
OS which is powered by Q and X iOS again
is something we've covered ad nauseam
you've seen it it's an icon based
interface there's not much customization
you can do you can make folders by
dragging an icon
without jailbreak and you're limited to
Apple sort of walled garden but it does
work well it's very elegant and it's
easy to use multitasking is accomplished
by double tapping the home button and
essentially it suspends applications and
will resume them when you select it and
yes that is a Starcraft 2 application I
do watch Starcraft 2 casts I know it's
tremendous nerd alert what's really
interesting what I'm starting to find
myself really enjoying is the BlackBerry
tablet OS and that's a similar look and
feel to what we've seen on the web OS
you get all the open application shell
read in the home screen when you want to
close them you can flick them off the
screen if you want to view your
applications you can go ahead and open
it up if you want to get back to the
home screen you can drag right up here
this bottom bezel is actually touch
sensitive which is kind of neat you want
to get to the menus you can pull down
from the top and get access to all the
menus right there and this is definitely
true multitasking things work very very
well so I've got a video right here if I
want to open it up and let's say there's
a playbook high def demo we'll go ahead
and let that start playing BlackBerry
PlayBook there it goes now if I slide
that up you can see that that video is
still playing there it's kinda neat to
see as I go through and look at other
applications that's still there if I
want to close that I can swipe it up or
there's that little
as I mentioned kind of neat you get the
controls to play and pause right there
show up on the top
I'm really excited when this finally
does get native male support
notification system should be quite nice
some of what we've seen on BlackBerry OS
6 you're gonna get those right across
the top it really is a very elegant
operating system and I've been very
impressed using it for the few days that
I've had it I think it's got a lot of
potential this round is gonna lie
squarely in a personal preference and
it's going to be a draw all right so
next let's talk about design both have
slate form factors the iPad 2 is pretty
optimal to be used in landscape or
portrait there's nothing really
remarkable about the design it is very
thin buttons are easily accessible the
volume up and down your rotation or
volume walk depending what you want to
send set it as you've got the power and
lock button on the top 3.5 milimeter
headset jack also on the top in the
bottom your connection port nothing
overly exciting the PlayBook is most
optimally viewed in landscape it's got a
nice feel to it the bezel is just big
enough that you can hold it and you're
not gonna worry about tapping the screen
the cameras I like because they're very
far from the middle so your fingers
aren't going to touch it it's got a nice
soft touch plastic feel to it what
really kills me however is the power and
lock button is absolutely tiny not only
is a tiny it's kind of recessed so
whenever you want to use that and access
it you really got to make sure you hit
it quite right almost an inexcusable
thing that rimmed it here go ahead and
open it back up again
I really need to make sure that I am
getting my nail and there sometimes to
hit it
I've got relatively decent size hands so
if you've got giant paws you're gonna
have a hard time hitting that button
something to keep in mind four factors
not really coming into effect in this
decision here but the button that I use
all the time the lock and power button
having that be noticeable on cumbrous
definitely factors into this decision so
the design is going to go to the iPad 2
all right next let's
talk about Cameras Cameras one of those
things that everybody was clamoring for
for the iPad 2 now that we haven't can
say it I don't really use the camera
very much on the iPad 2 but that might
be because it's extremely crappy the
camera on the back of this guy if we
flip it over its capable of shooting the
720p video the pictures that come out of
it or grainy don't look very nice at all
actually and often times I find my
finger covering that camera depending on
how I'm holding the device you have to
be very cognizant covet just doesn't
take the best pictures they've really
said with the megapixel edge is on it
presumably it's in the three issue Ange
the cameras on the PlayBook are capable
of shooting full 1080p video it's got a
five megapixel shooter on the back which
again is right in the middle so your
fingers aren't gonna cover it you've got
a nice three megapixel camera on the
front there isn't any flash on either
but you are getting a really nice camera
that works very very well I can see the
camera application open up there let me
take a picture of the iPad the camera is
just a world of difference as far as
what works better here and I thought
that this was important to include so
camera is definitely going to go to the
PlayBook all right let's go ahead and
wrap this up with a talk about the
potential of both platforms certainly
iOS has a ton of potential and that
potential is really squarely in the
hands of developers Apple's hasn't
changed operating system very much but
what the developers can do with it is
really a impressive feat applications
from looking at my screen right now from
speed test games to productivity video
editing there's a lot that you can do I
am very excited about the future of the
BlackBerry tablet OS actually once we
have Android app support once those
glaring holes of calendar and nail are
being filled and those are all something
that would be addressed as the operating
system in the tablet matures certainly
before we see the PlayBook - there's a
lot of potential in this operating
system we're looking at is probably the
future of blackberry as a
it's elegant it works very well it's
smooth it's optimized and I think that
if it gets developer support it could
definitely be a competitor in the tablet
world so this is most definitely going
to be a draw so we went through eight
rounds or recap them for you
browser surprisingly at least for me it
went to the playbook screen was a draw
text input went to the iPad two apps
also went to the iPad 2 OS was a draw
design went ipad 2 camera went back to
the playbook and potential was a draw
sentence us a final score of iPad 3
playbook 2 which means the iPad 2 is our
winner with three rounds being me draw
the iPad surprisingly barely eked out a
victory if the PlayBook had launched
with Android app support if we'd had
that missing calendar and mail
applications and if there'd been a
little bit more app support this would
have turned out very very differently
I'm really looking forward to revisiting
this in about six months when those
things have been filled in to see how
both of these tablets compare and are
maturing so what'd you guys think is the
playbook for you are you interested not
interested really curious to know what
you guys think i am john ruetten german
