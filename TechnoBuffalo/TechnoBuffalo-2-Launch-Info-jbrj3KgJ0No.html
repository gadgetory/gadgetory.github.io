technobuffalo here at the video that's
been almost a year in the making I am so
excited to announce and share with you
the launch plans a new feature list for
TechnoBuffalo two point oh it's the
evolution of the site so we started
TechnoBuffalo at the idea that we wanted
to be able to give the community of
voice I started off on YouTube with just
a webcam and a new laptop and I've been
really fortunate to have some
opportunities to explore my passion for
technology and I really want to be able
to give that opportunity to you there
are a lot of fantastic tech reviewers
out there with much more talent than I
do that aren't getting the exposure that
they deserve so one of the cornerstones
of the new TechnoBuffalo it's going to
be a way to help you guys get some
exposure so when we first launched
TechnoBuffalo back in round oktober 2009
we created a new idea of sub logs now
the sub blog idea had been around for
quite a while so you could create
TechnoBuffalo com watch your username
and you can have full wordpress content
management create your own website we
also let people put in their own ad code
and that was a way that we thought
people could create their own websites
and sort of get their voice out there so
the reality was very different than what
we expected turned out to be a haven
first fam unfortunately we had everyone
from fake jewelers creating their own
sub blogs to people that were
legitimately using the platform and
trying to grow unfortunately in sort of
an all candid I've always given you guys
full transparency I ran into some
problems with our sub blog model a first
people we're reaching out to PR firms
and companies as official
representatives of technobuffalo asking
for products which they were getting
sent and then we're doing a stir reviews
or coverage so essentially we're
stealing products from companies and was
really hurting the overall reputation of
me personally and technobuffalo second
managing the spam side of it turned out
to be a very very very daunting task so
about six to eight months ago oh it
almost became a parent
back to the drawing board to find a way
to evolve the site and give it a new
sense of community so what I came up
with and what we've sort of all
brainstorm is a fantastic way to have
you guys submit your content so whether
or not you're writer and you write
content on your own site whether or not
you have a YouTube blog with content
that you think is amazing that maybe no
one's looking at there's going to be a
brand new section on technobuffalo where
you can submit your content to us and
we'll be dictating content parameters
sometimes a week we can have a gaming
topic we can have a cellphone topic or
you can write about whatever is
interesting to you but we'll provide
some direction if you're looking for it
and will filter through all the content
and find what we think is really the
best and put it up on the home page
including a link to your YouTube channel
or your website that's one of the
features I'm really excited about
another feature that I'm looking forward
to this is less of a feature is a
complete redesign of the website its
spice to say the current design
technobuffalo I think is a little bit
cluttered and our new redesign is a
little bit slicker it's modern it's a
lot about the infrastructure in the back
end to the way we can manage a content
and we'll be able to add in new features
it's going to let us be a lot more
mobile so to say I'll just add things as
they become relevant out having to go
through issues of warning about multiple
logins for different platforms so
speaking of mobile we are finally going
to have a mobile platform for a
TechnoBuffalo so over right now start
off as a plug-in so when you login to
techno buffler you go to technical book
flow on your mobile device whether it's
iphone android webos a windows phone 7
whatever it might be you'll get a mobile
version and sort of as the launch
schedule progresses we're going to be
adding more features to that mobile
version so the next question everybody's
asking me is what are we going to see
the new technobuffalo well we're
scheduled to launch it and sort of a
limited release so some of you guys will
see it and some smite seed a few days
later on sunday january second so just a
few days before see you guys probably
closer to the evening you'll see a
splash page up there exciting or under
construction and hopefully fingers
crossed you guys all see the site live
the night of the second or the morning
of the third when you log in to check it
so that's all sort of the new features
that are going to be coming if you
currently
of a sub blog we're gonna ask you
migrated over to another other platform
you choose will be a list down below to
some awesome free website creators we
can go ahead and migrate all of your
content over and you'll have until the
second to go ahead and do that from a
staffing stamp but I'm really excited to
be able to deliver some really
cutting-edge content that's going to be
professionally generated from names that
I guarantee you you know and I can't
announce those things quite yet I got to
keep something for a surprise but look
for that announcement coming in the next
week or so after some of the people were
going to be announcing so I know this
video's a lot of me talking but I'm
really exciting you can tell this has
been a passion of mine and I really want
to build a platform from a youtuber and
from someone who started just in their
apartment at the time and I want to be
able to share that with you guys and
give you guys a platform and give you a
voice that maybe you're not getting
elsewhere and I'm really excited about
it one of the other things that we're
going to be adding that helps or make
the site of yours geo to vote on each
post similar on YouTube when you give a
thumbs up or thumbs down I thought help
us dictate content to be able to vote
whether or not you like a post don't
like a post I don't help us sort of
figure out what you want to see more
we're going to be covering a lot more
video games or can become what I like to
think is a resource for video games will
have sort of everything covered their
PlayStation Xbox and we certainly mobile
and laptops we're gonna have a lot of
regular shows as well so you start
seeing some familiar faces perhaps pop
up soon on my youtube channel so i hope
you guys are excited whether you like
technobuffalo now or maybe you've never
visited the site or maybe you didn't
like what it has been I do hope that
you'll give it a shot once we relaunch
again and you know it's something that
I'm just very excited that I hope you
can tell you know in my voice and the
passion that I have and I think you guys
for all your support and also of course
you know that I wouldn't do any sort of
relaunch without some awesome giveaways
so stay tuned for some really cool
giveaways and things that haven't really
been given away in the past and of
course open to everybody on this planet
as long as you were on earth so guys any
questions you have about the
TechnoBuffalo relaunch let me know I'm
really looking forward to sharing the
new design with you sharing the new
features with you and if you have any
ideas for things that maybe you'd want
to see I'm technobuffalo leave them down
below please
I'm really excited and looking forward
to seeing it hey guys i'm jon rettinger
