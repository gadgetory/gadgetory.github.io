TechnoBuffalo checking out the Nvidia
shield tablet your device that was just
announced today and it's one of the
first with their k1 processors and it's
an 8-inch tablet with a 1920 x 1200
pixel display inside you have 2 gigs of
ram either 16 gigs of storage that'll
run you at 299 or 32 gigs of storage and
LTE and that will run you 399 but let's
go through some of the features here up
top you've got the hdmi out port in
addition to a micro USB charging slot
and at 3.5 millimeter headphone jack I
can see part of a speaker there but
really you're looking at the the huge
speakers on the front here on the left
and right as I hold it like this and
that's also a 5 megapixel camera on the
back you have the shield branding
another 5 megapixel camera on the left
hand side you have nothing but we have
this cover on here that will be an
optional accessory and on the right hand
side you have if you look closely there
it's a micro SD card slot volume buttons
and the power button and microSD
supports up to 128 gigs of additional
storage there and right there you have
the second generation stylus that slides
right into the shield like that okay so
now we're looking at a lot of the games
that are going to launch with this or
within a few months afterwards half-life
portal you already know war thunder is
another game that's going to be
available anomaly 2 pure chess and the
Talos principle let's see if we can get
this booted up okay so right now we're
checking out a demo here of war thunder
I'll show you we'll go over the removal
in just a second but we're controlling
this right here with the remote control
uses Wi-Fi direct and we're playing
directly through the tablet which is
then using HDMI out to the TV for a full
console experience all from the tablet
itself and again this game otherwise
only runs on consoles and PCs so really
impressive that we're getting this kind
of performance right from an 8-inch
tablet
okay so now i'm here with the shield
controller and showing you how the whole
console experience works here so right
now we're on the home screen and i could
navigate with it easily just going
around bear with me one sec while I hit
a and launch that let's bring it up and
here we are inside the shield zone again
which is replacing a techno zone or
shield hub rather and replacing taggers
on you get news android games media apps
i showed you this earlier but this is
sort of like the hub you can have while
you're at home and if you want you can
also do things that obviously android
allows by holding the home button here
I'll bring up Google now launched
Netflix and the tablet will launch
Netflix right from that because it's
using the microphone that's built right
into the controller here so pretty
awesome technology right there you'd
have to get up from the couch and go tap
the tab when it's all done right here
and again that's because of the Wi-Fi
direct connection between the controller
and the tablet where you can send a
voice data back and forth over it so
lastly we'll just check out the
controller itself I've been using it
briefly here in the meeting they see
you've got the Nvidia home button there
they standard Android controls return
home and then the play/pause button
there's the microphone analog sticks you
got the joysticks standard layout very
Xbox like microphone jack up top again
using Wi-Fi so if you're playing with
the speakers on the tablet itself and
then plug in headphones here it'll turn
off the speakers on the tablet and
you'll be good to go and then there's
also a micro USB charging port you got
the triggers and then just some nice
contours there that make it really easy
to use and then on the bottom plus some
volume controls for up and down right
there so really nice controller and this
will be sold as a separate accessory and
then last we'll just look at the tablet
one more time with its
the tablet there and we'll see the whole
family so really nice again launching
for 299 to start with 16 gigs of storage
or 399 with 32 gigs and you can expand
that and then it also has LTE on the
higher end model with bands that support
AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile but no official
partnerships announced just yet in a
case that is a look here at the shield
tablet from Nvidia this is Todd Hazleton
