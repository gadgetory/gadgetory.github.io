to you by the all new G flex 2 from LG
life's good what's up everyone jon
rettinger from TechnoBuffalo here CES
2015 is now just a fond memory from
about a week and a half ago there was a
ton of ridiculously awesome tech there
and a lot of even awesomer car tech and
i talked a lot about that awesome car
tech in previous videos i talked about
the mercedes-benz f0 15 the Volkswagen
Golf R touched and Toyota Mirai they got
all the glitz and the glamour but there
was other ridiculously awesome tech the
car show so I present to you friends the
top 3 most badass pieces of car tech you
missed at CES 2015 so as outtie has been
for the past few years their booth is
gorgeous at CES we had to look hard to
find this piece of badassery it's a DS
virtual cockpit an all-new mm I which
stands for multimedia interface that
little knob and touchpad they've had for
quite a while but now it's getting a
gigantic upgrade so while a lot of car
tech is just crazy conceptual this one
is for realsies and coming on the 2016
q7 so moms everywhere should be pretty
excited the car will feature lifelike 3d
graphics powered by Nvidia on to
stupidly good-looking high res screens
with one behind the steering wheel that
is completely customizable a large
touchpad with eight programmable buttons
on the center console makes inputting
addresses and accessing menus just way
way easier google voice recognizes
natural speech commands finally just use
google speech that works so much better
for placing calls choosing song titles
and way bunch more the clincher though
for me is an optional rear entertainment
system that features two HD tablets both
of which can be used outside the
vehicles you just take them with you I
never made sense to have things that
flip down from the top or built into the
headrest when your tablet can do all of
that for not only way cheaper but also
you can dig it with you again coming on
the 2016 on the q7 number two BMW I cake
and mobility this is a whole suite of
tech so BMWs long been a thought leader
in the auto world as you probably know
some of the most beautiful cars most
advanced engines in the entire freaking
world but haven't always been the most
tech forward though and they're quickly
trying to change that and change that
fast already seeing that with the i3 and
the i8 at CES though BMW is taking that
tech too just like here's this level
they're going to like this level off
camera so it's I kick in mobility suite
of products already allows owners of the
i3 electric to incorporate poet
transportations their itinerary which is
nice you can see how long to take you to
get places as you get dragged to the
train station it will work with you to
do that BMW's i remote app for android
gets even awesomer users can now access
the best route be it by car bus train or
SmartWatch or of course on their
smartphone so pretty nice but what's new
this year is a car find your app that
you can find your car in a parking lot
or garage so that's awesome I get lost
easily be really helpful for me but most
impressive addition is your corporation
of smart TV functionality this allows
users to plan trips at home using
digital calendar from a smartphone or
personal computer or from a freaking
smart TV itself a BMWs cloud-based
service calculate the best routes to
take including be on foot to the nearest
parking lot or bus stop system will also
reconcile travel time between two
appointments at different locations so
you have no excuse to be late anymore it
even learns what type of transport user
prefers everything is synced to the
cloud so users can access itineraries
and directions via the Internet
connected smart TV vehicle dashboard
screen smartphone or SmartWatch slowly
builds a likely scenario for you for a
minute let's say you just picked up an
i3 and you're all proud of yourself
because you're like boom mock cars
electric and it's all connected and it
looks pretty sweet at least I think so
and you're like hey you know what it's
electric I can go the carpool lane I
don't have to be I don't have to rush to
get myself to work you're sitting on the
couch playing with your phones they just
picked up new G flex 2 and you're like
oh the Snapdragon 810 plays games so
fast oh no I'm gonna be late for work so
you go when see Allen's can take you to
drive to the train station your phone
tells you it's all you're gonna take it
14 minutes like that's be it work for 45
minutes I got more time to play some
more shooting games and you're like oh
crap then there's gonna be traffic
getting from the parking garage to the
train station which is weird but let's
say there is your phone can tell you how
to do that so they really interact make
it super easy for you integrate into
your phone all my jokes aside are gonna
make life just that much easier for you
and last but not least number three Ford
SYNC three you'll notice what I didn't
say I didn't say myford touch we've
reviewed a ton of four vehicles for the
most part really like the cars but the
myford touch interface with those four
quadrants and a lot of different touch
places you gotta strike we're convoluted
to use difficult to understand and be
powered by Microsoft for years but Ford
listen to it's User that was a big
reason that I know a lot of folks you
might not have wanted to get a Ford
they've ditched Microsoft now in favor
of blackberry and blackberry owns qnx
which is pretty stellar we've seen the
demonstrator for the past few years so
double units on the show floor it's es
were really snappy and operation and way
more intuitive and layout with simple
tile similar those on a cell phone or
tablet for key functions that you do all
the time things like climate control
stereo and navigation graphics aren't a
sophisticated looking though as before
but overall sync three appears to be a
huge improvement you get something to
use to and your cell phone and tablet
like pinch-to-zoom pinch-to-zoom making
just a much easier to use and simpler
and most importantly easy-to-understand
interface so what'd you guys think I
know some of the big car tech got all
the glitz and glamour but there were
three really awesome things that
happened on the car was at CES 2015 15
it didn't get the attention they
deserved I wanted to help enlighten you
what you guys was excited for love to
hear your thoughts on it until next time
