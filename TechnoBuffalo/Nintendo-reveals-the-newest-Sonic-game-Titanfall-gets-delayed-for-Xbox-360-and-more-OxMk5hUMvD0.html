to you by godaddy Ubisoft releases
quarter three fiscal results Nintendo
reveals the newest Sonic game and
titanfall gets delayed for Xbox 360 also
we play aqua kitty milk mine defender
and check out this week's new releases
let's get out of controller hello and
welcome out of controller the weekly
technobuffalo show that covers all your
gaming news reviews demos and new
releases in an easy to digest capsule
form I'm your host Ashley escoba it's
always a big weekend gaming so let's hit
the news Ubisoft delts swiftly with that
watch dogs trademark issue last week and
this week they're back in the news after
releasing their third quarter 2013 2014
fiscal results compared to the same
period of time last year Ubisoft's down
35.2 percent which is about a 300
million dollar difference that kind of
sucks but the good news is Ubisoft CEO
mentioned five high-profile titles
launching this year including watchdogs
which he pegged as quote first fiscal
quarter for release so we know now that
will be seen watch drugs between april
and june of this year unfortunately one
title omitted from that list of five is
the division meaning it's likely not
hitting retail shelves until april 2015
at the earliest boo last week Nintendo
revealed sonic boom a new exclusive
title for both the 3ds and Wii U the Wii
U version comes from developer big red
button entertainment and will focus
largely on combat and exploration
crazily enough it'll also be powered by
CryEngine 3 apparently this game will
also work as a prequel for an upcoming
sonic boom cartoon series if you're
interested in that kind of thing and the
3ds version will have different levels
and enemies to fight we never thought
we'd see the day something like
CryEngine 3 being used to power a sonic
title Sega is hoping to gain back some
of the gamer goodwill they failed to
garner with sonic lost world and this
new look and feel is part of their plan
to grab players both familiar and new to
Sonic if you're an xbox 360 owner who
thought you were picking up titanfall on
March 11th well think again
EA announced the delay late last week
saying the xbox 360 version of the game
would now be hitting retail shelves on
March 25th a blog post mentioned
developer Blue Point needing a little
extra time to put some finishing touches
on this version of the game but gave no
indication of trouble otherwise it's
only two weeks later than the xbox one
and pc version launches but that's still
a little frustrating for Xbox 360 owners
who wanted to pick up titanfall in day
one alongside those other two platforms
of course you can always do what
Microsoft hopes you'll do and just
upgrade to the xbox one on March 11th
let's play as a feature on our gaming
channel where a member of our writing
staff plays game and talks about it over
the footage this week Joey is playing
aqua kitty milk mine defender it's a
