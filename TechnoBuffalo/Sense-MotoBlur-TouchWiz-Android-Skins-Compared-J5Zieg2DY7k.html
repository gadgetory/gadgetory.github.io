technobuffalo here there's been a lot of
talk recently about Android handset
especially as 4G LTE starts to make
their way to phones and coming out of
CES that you're really all the rage
we've got the Atrix 4G coming out we've
got the droid bionic got the HTC
Thunderbolts the unnamed samsung 4g
phone all running Android but running
different skin sitting on top of Android
each kin offers a bit of unique
functionality and different UI tweaks a
lot of will be interesting to sort of
put these guys you know the
demonstration show you what each one
offers in the pros and cons and benefits
so it comes time to make a decision for
you for which handsets going to be best
you can make the most educated decision
possible and sort of demystify each of
these skins do let's go ahead and get
started so I figured before we look at
the skins we're going to need throop of
baseline comparison so what I've got in
front of me right now is stock Android
this is 2.3 Gingerbread running on the
Nexus X this is what Android looks like
in its raw form which is actually pretty
nice and a lot of people and tend to
prefer it oftentimes I tend to prefer
even stock Android so you've got an
array of icons of course one of the nice
things about Android is that it does run
widget so you can put little widgets
running on top of it and we'll show you
what those look like in different skins
we've got a panel of homescreens you've
got three buttons at the bottom go ahead
and see what the icon tray looks like
got a bit of a 3d effect right there the
keyboard is relatively nice on stock
Android go and show you what that looks
like we'll jump into messages real
quickly and go ahead and create a new
message and you can get you can
customize this really any way you like
you can add different keyboards you
could add swipe you can do a lot with
Android you can get you can sort of make
it to fit your needs that's really where
these skins come in there's how the
manufacturers thought that we might want
to use the phone and improve on the
stock Android experience so there's a
very short overview of what stock
Android looks like let's go ahead and
bring in contender number one let's
bring in moto blur alright so the first
skin we're going to take a look at is
Motorola's mo
knobler can tell cuz got that moto in it
this is a skin that we've seen and are
going to continue to see on a ton of
devices including the droidx the joy to
the droid one droid 2 global motorola
atrix coming out the droid bionic a lot
of motor oil devices chances are if it's
motorola device running android it's
going to have a version of motoblur on
it does have its custom unlock chain
will go ahead and a mock it and chances
are it's also going to have these three
colored buttons at the bottom other some
purchase of motoblur that don't pop with
the majority do and there's three sort
of custom buttons to make using android
a bit easier the one on the left of
course being gored dialer the one in the
middle Binger menu button and the one on
the right thing contacts you've got a
little bit of few tweaks here to the
dialer and stock Android but not much
being done here the icon rate does look
pretty standard I should mention that
there is a bit of android fragmentation
going on right now some devices are
running older version of android this
particular one is running 2.1 really up
to the carriers in the manufacturers so
when those updates are going to be
pushed out so some features and looks
may change depending on which version of
android you are running so go ahead and
at home what motoblur does and one of
the things that it does very well is it
integrates all of your social networking
into one interface i'll pull in all of
your facebook contacts and put it into
your contacts and use their pictures and
all that kind of stuff that we've seen a
lot of other skins do a motoblur dozen
sort of a very colorful almost
cartoonish why you can see that some of
these motoblur would look like they're
very bright and very vibrant motoblur
also offers offline sort of cloud
functionality so you sign up for a
motoblur account an automatically sync
all of your information you've ever have
to change phones or you'll lose your
phone or get stolen you sign into new
account all your information is going to
be there as I'm scrolling you can see
what those buttons look like across the
bottom showing each of the I believe
seven home screens I can see different
dots array are showing up you can pick
and jump to whichever one you like I'm
go ahead and show you what some of the
widget choices are right here I could
get into more detail on each scambos
return to probably a 40
Odyssey video so I'm going to breeze
over some of the features and
functionality and just talk about sort
of the general UI looks if you want to
see something in particular with one of
these skins I'll leave a comment down
below and I'll make a individual video
going over each so you the motorola
widgets you can see that there are quite
a bit and that bright color mentality
really comes through motoblur does add a
lot of functionality it's probably not
my favorite from an aesthetic standpoint
but from functionality standpoint it is
very good Motorola does actually offer a
custom keyboard here on motoblur sure
what that looks like very quickly and
jump at the tech message new message
here of course got an accelerometer as
well a little bit different than the
stock keyboard we saw on the nexus s and
the Nexus S does have a different
keyboard then most stock Android devices
is currently the only android 2.3 device
so sort of furthering the fracking
taking the differences you've got
between Gingerbread and previous builds
of Android so go ahead hit the home
button and that's actually another thing
to bring up motoblur does have a
different array of icons across the
bottom so modal for devices will only
have three some will have four the
fourth thing a search button your menu
button here is a bit different on
motoblur it's got sort of that four
boxes home and back are the same
certainly as the trend now most phones
are going to have capacitive buttons
across the bottom alright so this is a
quick look at motoblur let's go ahead
and jump into the next skin which is
going to be Samsung's own TouchWiz our
right to here is TouchWiz and all of its
TouchWiz II glory we're going to do this
demonstration on the epic 4g for sprint
but TouchWiz is what you're going to see
on all of the Samsung Galaxy S series of
devices one of the most popular series
of Android phones ever as well as the
galaxy tab and Samsung's upcoming 4g
devices as well so things are a bit
different hearings actually start with
the lock screen which looks a bit
different it's going to give you a bit
more notification information as well
let go ahead and lock the device and
unlock it each galaxy s phone has a
different unlock screen but the moral
here is the same you move something
somewhere else and you get all
first and information will show us there
so TouchWiz starts with four icons that
are docked across the bottom then you
can put whatever icons you like on the
top above it as you go ahead and move
screens as opposed to motoblur sort of
dots on the bottom you've got dots
across the top you hopefully you can see
right there and they move actually the
big one moves as you go ahead and scroll
through the icons here shown very
differently look at the application tray
they're all encapsulated in their own
little squares and the scrolling instead
of being vertical is horizontal nothing
drastic but it is sort of a bit of a
difference the phone is asked in quite a
bit as well I'm going to push it off to
the side so I don't reveal any phone
numbers you can see that this looks
modem noticeably different than what we
saw previously with motoblur serve one
example of the skin here go ahead and
hit home I think that's a home button we
now have four buttons across the bottom
service standard Android you notice that
the menu button is different than what
we saw in the past I go ahead and get it
to light up there it is you can see it's
not that sort of four squares that we
saw before it's sort of standard Android
menu button so we'll go ahead and jump
back home and take a look at some of the
widgets that we're going to get here a
TouchWiz does a lot in the widget eyes
department as well go ahead and see what
all of your choices are here and there's
quite a bit accuweather clock but is now
and the buddies now sort of thing we'll
bring in all of your contacts as well a
similar to motoblur you're going to find
that's a common theme among smoke most
orderly all of the android skins so go
ahead and jump back here and we continue
the torch go ahead take a look at the
keyboard you can go and put yourself
aside for just one minute and show you
what the keyboard is going to look like
you because the keyboard is definitely
different this is more of a stock
android keyboard android 2.2 however it
does ship was something called swype
which is a completely different keyboard
never flipped up your finger they do
some typing trip going to get a very
sort of different typing experience of
course particular device also has a
slide-out qwerty keyboard but that's
something that's unique to a particular
phone and isn't representative of
TouchWiz have a hole so go ahead and hit
home and we'll go ahead and go back
you can see what somebody's wouldn't
look like they are very bright and
colorful as well I found him to be a bit
more subdued though sub dude I should
say as opposed to motoblur I can see
they make the icon sort of bright and
colourful two up top there so that was a
very short and quick overview of
TouchWiz next let's go ahead and look at
HTC Sense alright so next and last up
and our skin tour is the HTC aria this
is of course when demonstrating HTC's
Sense go ahead and show you at the
unlock screen looks like I can slide
this down I should mention that there is
a newer version of HTC Sense available
see some of the cool weather stuff going
on right there available on the desire
HD which is actually not released in the
US so I don't have it here demonstrate
when the key differences you're going to
see on desire HD version of HTC Sense is
the ability to tie in with HTC Sense
calm oh if you're going to let you
download custom skins that will change
how these icons to the bottom look lets
you sort of further customize your
device and there's an even newer version
coming out which we saw demonstrated CES
on the HTC Thunderbolt which is a 4G LTE
device coming to verizon wireless
sometime this year I'll probably make
its way to other HTC devices but enough
of what's coming and what might be
available let's talk about what you were
going to get available now with HTC
sense which is really one of the first
DUI skins that we've seen permeate the
marketplace so actually first saw HTC
Sense which is previously called sent to
you I on the old windows mobile is
actually windows mobile maybe six or 6.5
was the first that had a version of HTC
Sense we sort of saw that transition
over to Android and serve once they
moved over to Android's really coming to
its own as one of the premier my
actually preferred Android skin so
you've got three buttons across the
bottom again remembering sort of that
Android cuts in the tub fragmentation
these icons may like a little bit
different depending on what device
you're using so go ahead and go back to
the home button and again you've got the
four sort of standard buttons although
instead of a
an icon representing menu this Victor
one actually says menu then depend on
which device you are running so HTC
Sense has a cool new fuel new cool
features you saw that clouds sort of
swarm through here got some 3d weather
action you can jump from screen to
screen like all the Android skins we've
seen by swiping across and there's a
little indicator the bottom right above
now phone and the swooping icons you can
see where it is but you can also do a
little pinched action good and see if
they'll work there we go I can go ahead
and jump to whatever home screen you
choose and you can move those around and
do some tweaks so you can see my
battery's almost dead go take a look at
some of the custom skins and custom
would say you're going to get HTC Sense
on HTC is always adding quite a bit more
so your device may have different
widgets than what we have right here
let's go and check a look at widgets so
you get more HTC widgets on the cool
thing you can go ahead and download a
lot more I find these to look a little
bit more professional they're less
colorful and less bright perhaps gear to
maybe an older audience but they all are
very very very functional so go ahead
and go back those will also pull in and
combine all of your social media and
integrate your facebook contact me to
contacts so use it pictures and you rest
so this does have a custom keyboard to
go and see what that looks like go ahead
and jump into new message tap for new
message and there is what HTC's keyboard
looks like and certainly you can put in
your own keyboard if you like this is
primarily what you're going to see with
HTC now they've taken the skinning
probably a few steps farther than
motorola and samsung have even things
like the menu and settings I've also
been skinned you can see that goes
through even deeper and you go through
sort of two or three steps and you still
see sort of little notices that sense
you why is there an eight you're not
running stock Android it's probably a
deeper skin that we had with the other
two one of its hallmarks is the sort of
big clock with the weather integrated
into it now we've seen that imitated on
a few other devices in fact you can
actually download that widget from the
Android Marketplace least you could
may have been removed it really has
become very well known of course all
these skins support multitouch browsers
on the all sort of take advantage of the
webkit-based functionality that android
has in its browsing system it's got a
great Twitter functionality called Pete
but of course you can download any
Twitter application you want from the
ever growing and increasingly awesome
android marketplace this has been sort
of again a short overview here of HTC
Sense I hope you guys enjoyed and it got
a sense of what different teams were
going to look like because maybe you see
what's best for you so we take a look at
moto blur we took the TouchWiz we take a
look at HTC Sense they all offer
something unique they all bring
something kind of fun to the table
there's a lot of really interesting
things you can do with each skin and
they all have a very unique look and
feel all the devices that are going to
offer these bring a tug to the table but
the most notable thing that brings that
table is what they have in comment
android which is an awesome offering
system which going to tweak and
customize it to best suit your needs for
me I prefer HTC sense but I've used
plenty of touch with devices and plenty
of motoblur devices and they all are
really good not be happy to use any of
the three so guys which do you prefer
any skin that you like do you prefer
Android naked and raw like we saw on the
Nexus S or you like it all gussied up
and ready for the ball in one of its
skins and I guys i'm jon rettinger from
technobuffalo see you the next video bye
