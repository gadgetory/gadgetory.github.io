other rev3 folks this nice to be in the
family anyway John on his way back to
the United States so he will be back for
ask the Buffalo next week so far as I
know but in the meantime I would have
been having fun sitting in so thanks for
having me
I'm gonna go out on a limb here say Who
lesbi who wants to know I know it can
you tell me what the best pair of
headphones are for around sixty to
eighty dollars good question i'm a music
fan I'm a drummer or back in a previous
life was it driven oh I still am I just
don't play as much as I used to get back
to that but I listen to music all the
time I use earphones all the time also
for work for editing video on the go
that kind of stuff I'm a big fan of in
the ER type earphones or canal phones as
they're called and this is one of my
favorite pairs this from a company
called etymotic said amota cree search
and it's actually 20 I was turned onto
etymotic years and years ago I was in a
bookstore in New York City in Brooklyn
where I used to live and as the checkout
counter opinion for whatever I was
buying and I had my headphones I guess I
had my headphones like around my neck or
sumptin and the guy behind the counter
check me out was like are those the
eddies you got to get the eddies man the
eddies where it's at and I was like
what's the eddies Eddie's etymotic
research I love the automotix this is a
pair from their new line neither the hf
3 which are a little more expensive but
they're in the ear type they go right in
your ear like that and they have a
couple different types of ear tips you
can use but you get a nice seal so you
get lots of noise reduction you have to
be careful if you're using them in
public you know if you're out walking
around you never want to use these
things driving without walking around or
something yell because they block out a
lot of the outside noise naturally but
it's great because you can focus on the
sound they're great for error you know
airplane travel commuting on the train
that kind of stuff and they sound
fantastic these are a little more
expensive but they have some new lines
that are compatible with Android as well
as blackberry and and iphone smartphones
and then they're older once the ER six
and ER 6i these are a couple years old
but if you can find them online and you
can still they're fantastic you can get
them in that sixty dollar range you were
talking about great sound I like them
because they were very kind of a even
sound curve they're not like the super
pumped up base although I believe it to
the six I has a little bit of extra base
if you want that but again a couple
years older
I think a great value in that sixty to
eighty dollar price range you're talking
about also clips the klipsch image I for
I believe it is came out last year a
little more towards the eighty dollar
range but also a really good sound a
little bit of a different fit I'm also
compatible with smartphones really nice
pair of earphones and then if you if you
want the old style or yeah well they're
old but they're still current the cans
you know the ones that go over your ears
I'm not as up on what's current but I do
know i have an old pair of sennheisers
that i still use i still really like
sennheiser's make some some good bang
for your buck ones even cheaper than
that 60 other price point you're talking
about mine were like thirty dollars or
something lots of people swear by Sony's
AKG makes some great ones as well
audio-technica make some really good
ones but I've had good luck with
Sunrisers for whatever that's worth but
lots of great companies making making
good quality earphones and you can
definitely get something good in that 68
other price range myself I like the
etymotic and for over the ears I like
doing that I like the sennheisers M
Simon wants to know what are your
thoughts on an HTC music player with
beats audio so you know HTC bought a
majority stake and Beats Audio not too
long ago and just after that HP
announced they were getting out of the
webos hardware game although maybe
they're back in I can't keep up with
that anyway but HTC bought majority
stake and Beats Audio a huge deal and
talked about how they're going to
incorporate Beats Audio in their
upcoming devices so we already have a
couple of reports couple of rumors going
up going around about what might be the
first to HTC phone so we're talking
about phones not music players but
phones to incorporate Beats Audio one
might be a special edition of the
sensation 4g which is a phone that in
the u.s. is right now available on
t-mobile and the other would be a new
phone that's going under the codename
runnymede both of these would come
packaged with a pair of beats audio
headphones probably the the solo which
are the cans type as well as having some
kind of Beats Audio technology in the
phone itself as for an actual music
player and not a phone so kind of like
an ipod touch the original question
actually referenced
you know like an iPod touch that's an
interesting question because at the same
time we saw Samsung has some android
based I they're called galaxy Wi-Fi and
they're not phones they're kind of like
the Galaxy S line of phones but without
the phone capability so there you know
Wi-Fi only more like an iPod touch sony
just showed off a prototype of an
android-based walkman again no phone
they already have walkman phones you
know their experience and incorporates
Walkman technology along with cell phone
technology running on Android they just
showed off a prototype i believe over it
Aoife prototype of an android-based
walkman device remains to be seen

Buffalo at checkout alright our last
question comes to us from alloys zero
alloy zero wants to know what do you
think the next stop is for Apple HD TVs
something else lots of rumors flying
around and actually cover this a little
bit in rumor roundup that aired last
Friday about Apple getting into the TV
business full force they've got the
apple TV product annex econd generation
a little set-top box they're still
referring to it as a hobby they put out
that first gen boxed and do all that
well the second generation it's smaller
it's cheaper it doesn't have a hard
drive it's done much better for them and
rumors flying around that they've been
working on an actual HDTV with be
basically Apple TV functionality baked
into it but more sophisticated more
powerful functionality than what's
currently available and that they've
also been working for a while I'm trying
to get the TV studio's the network's the
distribution partners everybody on board
with a subscription-based TV plan
basically they want to do to the TV
industry what they've already done or
help due to the music industry which is
just disrupt the heck out of it all
