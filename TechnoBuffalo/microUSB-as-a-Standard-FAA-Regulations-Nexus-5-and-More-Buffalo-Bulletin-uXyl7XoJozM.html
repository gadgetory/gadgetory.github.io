leaked Nexus 5 details Nintendo Direct
an uncertain future for ea's NCAA
football and relaxing FAA rules for
gadgets it's Buffalo bulletin time
hello internet and welcome to the
Buffalo bulletin where we recap five
major stories from our site
TechnoBuffalo calm every tuesday and
friday if you're interested in reading
more about any story we talk about of
the show check the description for links
or click on the graphics for each story
if you have annotations available and
toggled on I'm Ashley sceva hair your
top stories the European Union seems to
have decided it will be going forward
with calls to make microUSB charging
mandatory in all mobile devices
obviously this is most problematic for
say Apple who uses a proprietary
lightning charging cable but regardless
there's this little thing i would like
to let the EU know about called
technology that keeps moving forward
meaning microUSB will likely die at some
point so requiring a particular charger
means no company apple or not can create
something faster and newer for future
devices and that's just dumb android
fans eagerly awaiting the next Nexus
phone might not be waiting much longer
as a combined code and photo leak early
this week gave us some glimpses of what
the Nexus 5 may offer it'll be designed
by LG android kitkat 4.4 snapdragon 800
2 gigs around eight megapixel camera now
those specs are not exactly top of the
line for current phones but that's never
really stopped the Nexus line of devices
for being superb so we're really looking
forward to the official announcement
soon in gaming Nintendo held another
Nintendo Direct event this morning
showing off a couple new trailers and
announcing some exciting news super
mario world 3d got a fun trailer playing
as Sonic and super smash brothers wii u
and 3ds is now official a new kirby game
for 3ds was announced and a paid dlc
pack for Pikmin 3 was also revealed oh
I'm sure fans were really pleased with
today's direct as these first party eye
peas are seeing something that old
nintendo magic attached i'm still
waiting for a new Metroid though well
this story is interesting from gaming it
looks like EA has decided they will not
release NCAA football next year and
announced their intent to evaluate the
future of the entire series that may
sound surprising given its popularity
but it's actually part of a
long complicated legal dispute between
the NCAA and student athletes who want
to be compensated for the use of their
likeness in entertainment products like
NCAA football so the news is unfortunate
but hopefully a fair decision will be
made for those athletes that put their
bodies on the line every single game
throughout their college careers lastly
our grab bag story for today will
hopefully make frequent flyers a little
bit more comfortable during takeoff and
landing an advisory panel recommended to
the FAA that restrictions be lifted on
mobile device use under 10,000 feet
meaning you'll be able to use your phone
in airplane mode while the plane departs
and arrives a welcome change to airline
policy for many of us tech geeks who
travel that's the Buffalo bulletin for
today if you enjoyed the show a thumbs
up would be super awesome of you and if
