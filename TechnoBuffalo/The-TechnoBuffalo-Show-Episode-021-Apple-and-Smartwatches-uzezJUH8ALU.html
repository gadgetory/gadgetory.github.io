TechnoBuffalo show I'm I grew to house
for donation Nani editor-in-chief of the
site and i'm joined by executive editor
mobile Todd asel t'en everybody ah too
bad was a quiet week yeah quiet two
weeks yeah I mean nothing's been going
on I mean I shows up we got nothing
talking about by everyone yeah there's
nothing Thank You Jay like so yeah we do
it tuesday was the christmas day of the
tech world or the the superbowl we
internally refer to it as the Super Bowl
because it's a one-and-done event as
opposed to like CES which goes on for an
entire week mm-hmm but the Apple day is
always an interesting experience and
some of the rumors proved to be true
some didn't I'm thankful that it was not
called the iphone 6 well I was not
thrillin to that name yeah iphone 6 plus
a--'s and they had to find some way to
delineate between the two but yes so we
finally know the iphone 6 well actually
we've known the iphone 6 4 months i mean
we've had a dummy unit in the air by
office for how long yeah for a long time
probably yeah it looked exactly the same
as the real fo now before we go too much
further let's do be let's be up front
with everyone here we you and I were not
at the apple event John Wells we covered
a bean ice cream that failed all the
time yeah what what's the TV truck
schedule but the John is the only member
of staff has actually physically touched
the two new iphone sixes our seeing the
Apple watch in person let's address that
real quick why in the world did they not
called the iWatch I don't know it seems
like that would have been perfect I mean
I saw some headlines to kind of we're
saying like this is tim cook's apple now
and so it's not i watch it's like we you
know like just either
taking the even though it's the most
personal gadget they've ever launched
according to Apple they're taking the
eye out of it like and I think we saw
some examples with that where you know
the messaging and sending the heart rate
and stuff like that it it was weird but
it's not just about I I think I think
that was the message I don't know them
okay I study poetry so I could dig into
it I guess will you ever under any
circumstance send somebody your heart
rate no I mean well I don't even
understand like why that's an option I I
fit my gut feeling Ezio it's supposed to
be like you if your remain decoupled you
wanna express how much affection you
feel for them I don't know it may I i
was saying here during the live stream
and they mentioned the ascender hurt
right I was like wait what I know it
makes you wonder like do you think they
did that like at first like you could
send this to your doctor so they know
like what's going on if they need to or
something and then like but then they
couldn't get approval maybe from the you
know the FDA and so they're like oh well
we'll still include the feature but
we'll make it a social feature not like
i can just say that i said suddenly my
heart rate and I get back are you that
much in love with me or are you having a
heart attack oh yeah I yes that's just
one of many features they listed for the
the Apple watch but I was just like yeah
I'm never gonna sit anybody my heart
rate that is never going to happen no I
can't even see it sitting it as a joke
haha well now you know and i get 1 i'm
gonna send you my heart rate as a joke
oh thank you so much Todd I i look
forward to exact Todd there's no heart
rate here here you're not still online
oh man but that's what it is you should
so you can monitor your love see each
other still life they've still got a
heartbeat don't need to see grandma this
weekend haha
he's looks fine jus looks fine here next
week good time but no I mean so yeah we
all knew what the iphone 6 was going to
look like I do find it really
interesting that yeah I I really I began
to question the 5.5 inch and the final
run up to to the event because we really
had not seen any leaks on it yeah we'd
see just like sort of the bodies but it
wasn't as frequent as we saw for the
iphone 6 and then there were the rumors
that like there was problems with the
display or like that it wasn't gonna
launch on time and so what's funny and
so I think I wasn't sure either or or
you know the rumors that it was gonna
watch later this year which would have
been a bummer right like and I hope
there's enough stock that we can all buy
them you know on time this was laughing
about from Dominique Weber can you
please activate some chinese translation
I don't like streams without my chinese
translation yeah lyst AA zomberry got
i'll see what we could do about that oh
hey Apple stream the Apple stream had a
loud chinese translation for those who
didn't tune in for that yeah so no I it
does make you wonder is there going to
be a short supply on the 5.5 I don't
know why I keep calling at the 5.5 when
it has an actual name male 6 plus yeah
the six plus but I don't know I found it
really interesting I found it also
really interesting that the Apple watch
had not leaked out in any way we had not
seen that design anywhere yeah and to be
frank I think if I did see it i would
have thought it was it fake because it
doesn't look like an apple product like
is it just me it just doesn't I don't
know especially the golden one I mean I
get it they're going for premium design
and I don't even know what that thinks
gonna cost because you gotta figured
that the the price they gave 349 s for
the cheapest model probably with a
rubber strap then with the smallest
display so you know
what's the larger display with a metal
band or an 18 carat gold or whatever it
is banyan costumes ridiculous yeah I I
don't know um and everyone you know even
my my mother talked to me later it did
she's like who are you get an Apple
watch i was like i am no idea she was
well it's only three forty eight nine I
was like ah ha ha starting at 349 yeah
exactly yeah ngo I didn't catch I was
like yeah that's starting at 349 so we
don't know how high this thing's gonna
go and you gotta figure that addition is
not gonna be cheap it's well as it is I
think 349 s2i yeah definitely I mean
here I have I mean I don't it's not
sapphire right the 360 but I'll show I
mean I got the 360 in yesterday and this
thing is sweet so far like it's hard to
tell that it's even a SmartWatch not it
looks gorgeous I another watch in my
room its own i usually wear on the show
and it's the one that my wife bought me
and it's a luminox and so it's got a
metal and a big big metal body too and
so this actually feels lighter and I
don't know it's a nice watch then
fortunate thing is it's still running
Android wear yeah they're not likely to
get the Android wear you but hey so they
met and that's any comments we make
towards Android wear it's the fact that
it still just feels too uncashed well
you know what's crazy we were um in in
Berlin last week I was there for fo for
those who aren't familiar and several of
the journalists were wearing Android
wear watches most had the gear live
because they made a better decision than
I did but we were all wearing him and it
was super useful i gotta say as i was
walking around getting the alerts like
calendar alerts and stuff like that I
actually really did enjoy it for the
first time I was like okay you know this
makes sense but right around my house uh
huh the motor yeah well from Christopher
miles he asked do you think 349 is too
much for a smartphone accessory and
that's a really interesting question
yeah we view
not just the Apple watch but do we view
smartwatches currently as just smart
phone accessories I think so I mean yeah
you know the gear s is sort of like its
own standalone but I think other that
you have to because it's like it's like
having a bluetooth speaker right like
you can't do anything with it unless you
have something to give it life and I
think smartwatches I mean yeah it'll
tell the time right but then I mean you
need it you need a smartphone so I think
it's sort of the accessory but people
are talking about the Apple iWatch still
and are curious is that still an
accessory because I think we have to see
like sort of all how the software works
I don't think we've seen a lot of that
yet and like can it stand alone better
than Android wear like Android wear can
you stand alone right all right all the
same with a pebble right yeah so I don't
know it's gonna be interesting i do
think 349 is too high i think that you
know it's some of the same problem that
we had with the fire phone and that it
was just it was too i right and these
companies are I would you know the fire
phone had come out at say you know 349
full price i would i would about one and
immediately regretted after having a
bright after yeah i did love those years
last night yeah fire fire to know the
fire phones table um but I I do i think
the Apple watch is going to have a
pricing problem miss you know again
we're judging it on honestly folks you
if you watch the stream you know as much
about the Apple watch as we do yeah you
know they didn't let John play with one
they were just on the rotating hooks so
yeah I we don't know anything more than
you do so I'm withholding judgment at
this time on the Apple watch until I
actually get to touched one and see what
it's like
that being said it's going to have to be
really impressive to justify that price
yep really a lot of money it's half the
price of an iWatch I mean I mean huh fea
an iphone 6 from twitter i'm not gonna
stop saying i watch by the way just like
that nobody is because i forgot to
address this at the top of the show dan
Legesse asks where's joey joey is this
is the time of year where gaming becomes
insanity and he yeah always currently
reviewing destiny and NHL 15 I am trying
to twitch every morning so Joey is
probably going to be incommunicado for a
little bit because he also shared with
me the other day the review list for the
next three months it's a monster it is
not I think there's 23 games on the
roster oh my goodness yeah and that will
be split between him Eric and Ron but
still it's just like wow um have fun
guys so Joey still around but Joey is
very deep into the beginning of the
crazy fall review season right from
Dominique Webber at Todd I know you just
got this yesterday but i'll go ahead and
ask it hey Todd how much battery life do
you get with mom 236 yes okay so he just
got it yesterday and it came with like
thirty three percent battery life I
think okay and and I was setting it up
and trying to figure out the charging it
wasn't charging right away for some
reason I think kept saying like battery
like charge your device and then it
would shut up so after all that I got in
the car to go to fox business yesterday
and I had a 50-percent charge and by the
time and now I paired it in the car it
had to download a software update and
all this stuff by the time I got home it
was at like six percent which is
terrible right like that's forty six
percent in the mere three hours I was
gone but um then yesterday I let it on
for a full charge and um I took it off
at about seven o'clock last night
and then you know I got my notifications
but not many you know through the night
and now I'm a 51-percent and it's twelve
o'clock here and I didn't charge it last
night I just left it on my bed stand so
it's not terrible that's all terrible I
we I can't agree on the first day I mean
you're pairing you're downloading
everything else yeah I can see where
battery would drain faster but uh was
like what the heck put a charge is
really really quickly yeah if you didn't
charge last night and you're at
51-percent that's not bad yeah from 7pm
on so now yeah so yeah you're 15 hour 15
16 hours in that's at 17 hours then
that's not bad oh um really good
question from Alan all the questions are
good but this one really caught my eye
here from Alan Hobson why call it the
iphone 6 plus and said the iphone error
and the iphone mini it's a good question
i think many would be kind of confusing
only I mean only because you're still
going from a 4-inch display on the
iphone 5s to a 4.7 so it's still getting
bigger in Brighton so I think that would
be but I like the iphone air name I mean
I think that would've been really cool
especially I was like just slightly
smaller than me not slightly smaller
than the other your iPad Mini but no I I
really I did think it was gonna be
iphone air I I really was lean because
then we would have had continuity across
the product lines hmm but I don't know
it would make sense maybe maybe little
change in at some point I don't know
because it would make sense you're right
i mean if you go it's the same as the
ipad family Aaron Vinny well we were
joking yesterday in the urban yeah I was
joking i am it was in the company chair
i was joking on IM with some of the guys
and you know what would what is next
year's iteration good me called the
iphone 6 plus plus yeah there's a buddy
jon rettinger story is it will be 6s
plus but yeah so that's getting lengthy
mm-hm plus i mean i don't know i mean
but look at what Motorola did right
x plus one they just called it the Moto
X again which I don't see Apple doing
and that's kind of riding either and I
really hate that Motorola did that just
because there's going to be confusion
yeah you know I i I'm sorry every
product should have a distinct name I'm
that's just my believe you should not
reuse a name exactly yes especially when
I consumers like looking for accessories
or news or like like how do you you know
Jake oh do I have the 2013 mall or 2014
model in a year down the road what do
you know that the accept that is an
excellent point right there on the
accessories because last year's Moto X
is smaller than this year's so if a
consumers in a store and sees oh this
case will work with a moto x and then
yeah they aren't gonna know you're like
buying a gift for somebody or something
yeah and I that's I fully believe that
every phone should have a distinct name
it's you know and moto x plus one would
have been fine ill Moto X to whatever
but just don't call it moto X well but
it is what it is uh so we really haven't
done delved into the phones you know I
think a lot of the surprise was removed
by the fact that we had seen the dummy
units for so long we had seen the
schematics and everything else mm-hmm
but at the end of the day was there
really anything that revolutionary um
will the mobile payments which I see
people talking about um it's not okay
okay I should I should step back it's
not revolutionary right like people are
going to jump down my throat other
people have been trying this for a long
time but I did see and I hate to say it
but I'm excited to see Apple trying it
because it's it I think it has the best
chance at working I mean it didn't work
for Google Wallet like it's still not
working right like it's in some stores
but nobody really knows about it or use
it that uses it and now all of a sudden
Apple dozen people are like oh they're
like you can use your phone for payments
it's like boy tell you
can do that for years but if people
don't know about if people don't use it
and if Apple can teach people to know
about it I think this is good for
everybody right because then people will
start using Google Wallet more and then
all these like all the checkout pointer
points of check out and all the retail
stores are gonna be all set to take
these payments whether you have an
iphone or you have google wallet because
it's the point of sale right so we'll
see rising attitude one thing they
didn't mention it Todd you know this
about me I am a complete loyalty points
fanatic yeah yeah I want Apple paid also
contain oh they're coming for us yeah I
want them I want haha look I want them
to also contain my rewards cards that
would be awesome you know so let's say
all right walgreens has a rewards
program so let's say it walgreens is one
of the partner store so let's say I go
in I tap my phone for the payment could
it also transfer my loyalty program at
the same time I bet that would be
awesome because you can do it with
google wallet has loyalty cards and then
you can make your yeah so like you scan
your card and make a payment yeah yeah I
don't know we'll see I I think and like
you said the whole problem is biz that
people have not been educated on mobile
payments they have every mobile payments
platform has done a horrible job of
educating Joe consumer right now Apple
comes along and for better or worse when
Apple talks people suddenly listen
mm-hmm so apples going to be out there
promoting Apple pay I think the other
thing Apple did that was really bright
it was they went out and they built
these partnerships before the
announcement so there's not going to be
this oh now we'll go talk to merchants
try and get them do it done Apple went
ahead and got out there and when we're
launching this do you want to be him
right but they're launching in October
yeah you have a little delay i love the
way but I i I'm not that surprised
because it is going to take a while I
thought that was real
really interesting you could use it at
McDonald's Drive thrus yeah what's that
about is just like I guess they have one
right there in the tank they may have a
like one they can hold out the window
you could tap to that way it wouldn't be
exposed to the elements all the time
right right but no it's all very iPhones
are gonna drop onto the concrete between
the window and car oh ok even think
about that but that might be apples way
to sell an extra million phones Yeah
right ah but no it's interesting but as
for the phone itself yeah it's I like
the design but it's the same design
we've been seeing on the minute mini in
the air hmm it's a there is a point
where i'm going to finally say okay the
phones are getting too thin you know I I
have monster hands as we've all seen yo
remember folks this is a galaxy mega 6.3
and it looks like a normal person's
phone in my hand yeah I swear I keep
that thing around as a prop for the rest
of my life ah fine yeah exactly so I I
do wonder if you know phones are getting
too thin but I mean yes it's a it's a
gorgeous design yes it's gonna have iOS
8 but the five in the 5s will have iOS 8
as well as well as the 4s maybe the four
I can't remember every phone that's
getting it but I don't know that being
said yes Todd and I are both getting
sixes well we gained six pluses 6 plus
yes because we're wild men like that uh
speaking of the six plus we do have a
question here from keegan sutherland do
you think the 6 plus is too big for a
person's jeans pocket how big are your
games I get these like comments all the
time and I were probably skinnier jeans
than I should I don't have I've been
made to talk to you about that yeah it's
just not good luck I know but like I
haven't had a problem so I don't know it
really depends on your jeans right
mm yeah I realize so you know like I'm
not a fashion-forward kind of guy either
I I searched before and I I do not
believe in it wearing any pair of pants
that does not is not cargo I always have
a pocket that's big enough for something
yeah yeah yeahs cargo pants for sure yes
we're the wrong people to ask no I
honestly key i think it's gonna be fine
you know now if you put a case on it
might start to get a little wonky
depending on the thickness and height of
the case I always put my phones in cases
well not all of them most of them so
it's just going to depend you know go
into an apple store slip one in your
pocket they will be fine with that
they'll be fine that's what they should
have hey you try out for the pocket try
that station all also all fun sellers
should have a pocket tray outstation uh
from dan lages day and I apologize if I
mispronounce your last name do you think
apples ditch the iphone 5 CEO the
CSeries yeah it was so selling it right
aren't there still selling it but I
don't think there's ever going to be
another iteration more unapologetically
plastic phones oh I you know as soon as
I said Johnny I was doing that video for
the Apple watch I was like please
something be unapologetically please
that joke must live for the eons yeah
because all right the 5 c's free now but
I mean it's been like a penny for months
exactly yeah nice is 99 bucks was a
great deal election yeah the 5c is now
the entry-level phone that you can get
free on contract but I do not think that
there will be another iteration of it
and that being said we do need to have
just a moment of respect silence for the
for the passing of the ipod classic
farewell old friend we're good me gets
greater yes ah I still carry an ipod
classic and I still have a back bipod
classic I don't care yes even leave me
from wired well no he used to write for
Wired lee's famous tech writer said you
can take my ipod classic when you pry it
from my cold dead fingers i retweeted up
I just say way you know the thing the
thing that never made sense to me about
the ipod classic and the the lack of
updates it went over 1800 days without
an update why didn't they put a solid
state drive in it and make it for those
of us that have these giant music
catalogs they could have sold them
cheaper they could yo well solid-state
drives back then were expensive they
were back then yes but they've come way
down so why didn't they finally update
it with a solid drive with a hundred and
80 gigabytes or whatever yeah yeah
what's the what's the largest ipod touch
these days I think 128 do you think huh
I mean yeah but I guess you just like Oh
64 actually yeah okay well I like the
hard drive size I also like the
durability of the classic because when I
used to go to the gym before I I end up
quitting the gym so I could just buy my
own equipment I got really tired of
driving into town every day um you know
I like the fact that I didn't worry as
much about the classic because it didn't
have you know the giant touchscreen on
it so you know if I was going to wear it
on my arm or something you know I was
always concerned it would bump into a
machine or fall off while I was on the
treadmill or whatever else I I just
always felt like touch screens were too
much of a risk in the gym parents up if
that's why I stayed with the classic for
so long it just you know I i had a speck
case for it that which had speck cases
seen better days at this point but you
know I just always felt more comfortable
with the safety issues mmhmm yeah so
miss the classic you know it who said
you know I doubt that apple will ever do
anything without a touch screen again so
sad day sad days yeah yeah yeahs done
that yeah we were talking about the size
of the touch I I have 160 gigabyte
classic but yeah that was the biggest
there ever gob was the 160 and that's
what I carry that's what my spare is yes
folks I have a spare classic I don't
care what you say about me I will live
on with the classic for decades forever
but uh oh here's a non-apple question
will move into something else for a
minute from Dan again I'm edge I'm
slaughter your name lages uh what do you
think of the leaked windows 9 images
it'll good to me I'm not cited for that
start menu and what is the only thing to
get excited for but I'm right there with
you know and I was talking about this
with other journalists last week too i
was like ok windows it's always about
windows right like not about tiles and
when you open up these modern UI apps
they just take over the whole screen
like they would on like a tablet but
this is a pc like my compare my desktop
here right next to me so windows 8.1 pc
and it drives me nuts i'm like no i want
this in a windowed mode you know cuz i'd
like to have things all over the place
so like right so they're bringing it
looks like there's more control than
that which is great and then the start
menu which you know i really like to
because I hate going into modern UI like
that title based interface and trying to
dig through looking for the Apple it
just doesn't make sense like with a
mouse and a keyboard it doesn't make any
sense i know i think i'm not a window
plan i guess is supposed to be like
bringing back some of the features that
people with mice and keyboards locks
well this is the thing this was the
thing i always felt was wrong with
windows 8 from day one was there like oh
you'll have so much you know such a
better experience with touchscreens
windows is the dominant operating system
and business fine not a problem
were they expecting big corporations to
go out and buy 5,000 10,000 20,000
touchscreen monitors I don't think so
and like I don't even like you with
touchscreen but I'm just like that's
just me um yeah okay so I I'm on an imac
here I i love my imac but I'm sorry I
don't ever see myself in yellow typing
oh I need to change that yeah it's just
not how I know no it's not it's how I
interact with the tablet that's fine on
my desktop here it's a 27-inch imac I'm
sorry I mean I have zero desire to ever
reach up and touch the screen yeah you
know and I I think windows has learned a
valuable or Microsoft has learned a
valuable lesson here about the windows
product people while change is good it
takes a long time to embrace it mm-hmm
you know and like I think it should be
an option like it's not like it's hard
to leave those I mean it's been in
Windows forever the mouse and keyboard
controls like why i get rid of them and
why is it taking so long bring back no
no no yeah no i totally agree with you i
totally agree with you from allen Hobson
maybe I miss it but do the new iphones
have eliminated sapphire display like we
thought no yeah no sapphire there no I
think the sapphire is going to be all
about the the watch yeah i just i don't
think that they can afford yet to do
sapphire on that large of a screen for
that many units yeah and nortel poured
it I think that's actually why the watch
is probably that's it yeah but it does
have the Sapphire you know coating on on
the back camera and then on the touch ID
too yeah where does from Dominique
Webber how on earth could motorolla
choose a processor that was released in
2010 for the Moto 360 pretty easy yeah I
think they had a lot of these processors
probably sitting around so i put a
minute but here's the thing
I'm wearing the 360 now it performs just
as well as the G watch I have in the
other room um and I don't I have not
seen anything that takes advantage of
the Snapdragon 400 processor in the in
the G watch so so for me show me why I
eat a better processor because I'm fine
it's a watch you know and it's just
taking your notifications it's not like
it's doing anything that Snapdragon 400
seems like overkill but I don't know
yeah I know I think that I want right
now the current iteration of
smartwatches is a very different beast
on a smartphone and they don't need that
much horsepower yet you know and there
will be a day where the Snapdragon 800 s
in there it's probably four years down
below but I just don't see the knee like
why do you need that it's like what Bill
Gates would say you know like why would
you ever need this much storage in yet
here we are yeah I know the idea that I
can have one terabyte of cloud storage
just boggles my mind interesting
question from Tehran Sorenson so what's
the scoop on windows 9 it seems to be
cancelled when it's supposed to be
coming very soon and cancel again what
do you go well here's the story I think
what might what might be confusing you
is I think there is there was talk of a
bigger update to Windows 8.1 and then
Microsoft decided to do monthly releases
their latest was in August actually and
then meanwhile they're also working
towards apparently windows 9 or whatever
it's called but they're going to release
the windows I guess technical preview
which should follow their September 30th
event I guess either you know like that
day or early october which will then be
a preview of windows 9 and what's coming
the next operating system sometime later
next year so it's not going to be
windows 9 just yet but I think what your
maybe and on the on the other side
meanwhile windows 8.1 is still getting
these monthly updates as they build up
to the release of Windows line so I
think
maybe when you maybe it was like a
Windows 8.1 big update you were
expecting in which case yeah that's not
how it's working anymore you're just
doing mock the releases from Christopher
miles does this actually compete with
Android wear a meaning the Apple watch
does this actually compete with Android
wear since your choice is completely
depend on which phone you have good
that's a good question there's a very
good question I think android wear
should like Google should find a way to
make it compatible with iOS because yes
keeper I mean with the exception of the
pebble right now whatever SmartWatch you
buy is pretty much to pin it on one
singular OS which and see and I think
that's really silly especially on
Apple's part because the yes the iphone
is the number one best-selling phone
model it's not you know not the dominant
of the market because of how many phone
samsung releases and so on but Apple
Joey made an excellent point the other
day he was going to be watching the live
stream and he has both pc mecca home but
he wanted to watch it on his pc he goes
so you're telling me that to watch an
apple presentation which is all about
introducing new products i have to
already be in apples ecosystem to learn
about products that could possibly lure
me into the ecosystem yeah and I think
I've read that it's the same case with
the Apple watch if it was Android
compatible that could be yet another
entry point into the apple ecosystem now
I understand the App Store and all that
you know fine but yeah it does seem a
little odd it and your ear right
Christopher it's hard to say that they
compete with one another because right
now Android where's Android and Apple
watches iOS so they're they're preaching
to the choir in both situations yeah but
it's good android wear needs needs a
huge competitor in the sense that
there's something
else going on and that people might look
at one or the other maybe Apple watch
users look at Android wear and say hey
how come I can't do that and back and
forth and then that's where we get
progression of products so it's great
and pebble and Sony everybody else okay
from out Hobson will they update the
Apple watch every year or will it take
longer I mean they took three years plus
three to six more months to release it
the first time okay that's mm-hmm the
development process on any product when
they were working on the original iphone
just as an example we know they were
also working on the iphone 3g and the
3gs they knew those were coming so there
was about a three-year development cycle
before the first iPhone came out that's
that's very very typical with new
products so yes they it seems like it
took a long time but that's because
people like Tata myself we're seeing her
going there's apple watch coming but
yeah and there's also the question of
how long ago in the process were we just
writing off of people's fantasies
compared to actual factual leaks you
know it's like the end the mythical
apple television set yeah we still do
not know if that thing even is in
development we have no idea we hear
rumors about all the time so now if an
apple TV someday let's say in 2020 Apple
finally decides release to television
can we sit around go what we've been
writing about a thing for 15 years oh
who knows you know it's one of those
things I think everyone expected Apple
to work on a watch but we have no clue
when they actually really started work
out they may tell us someday but it's
Apple they don't tell us anything they
don't absolutely have to right so uh
from a heck of a name fame muzu me TD I
hope I got that right what do you think
about Apple pay
the Apple watch chance it does not have
to have fingerprint sensor do you think
it would compromise security we now
interesting it's still not the same as a
fingerprint it does have to have a skin
contact so which we just found out the a
course that's not the same as 0 anyone's
skin would work yeah it seems like
anyone's that's weird yeah that is a
little odd um does it come from it's a
good question i'm trying i have a
feeling there's something that we don't
know about yet yeah that's what I think
that comes down to like bra I want to
see how how the Apple watch and iphone 6
work together and how the software sort
of hands off I mean it's hard to say
like it's going to compromise security
because sure like if I if I find it I
watched and I can run around and make
payments like but I don't see that I
mean I don't see that sort of being that
easy there has to be something sort of
in there i mean the Apple hasn't really
talked so much about it aside from
saying it'll work so yeah we're we're
limited on speculation yeah exactly uh
from Dominique Weber do you think
Microsoft could afford to release
windows 9 for free it would definitely
improve the adoption rate on windows
thank you I guess I mean you can afford
to you sure it can afford to but
Microsoft and now true they have a new
CEO you know the
first time oh okay sorry about that
folks for some reason when Time Machine
kicks in to do its hourly check it it's
time machine okay so Microsoft does have
a new CEO that's the first one outside
of the original core group of like Bill
Gates and Steve Ballmer and all that he
could change the game but it's kind of
inherent in Microsoft's DNA to charge
for everything I'm not saying that's
good or that's bad but that's just the
way Microsoft is built yes Microsoft
could afford to do it will they that's a
whole different kettle of fish yeah back
to the other question Jacob just Jacob
one of our staff members said he thinks
whenever you take the iWatch are the
Apple watch I'm still calling it i watch
whenever you take it off it needs a
passcode to turn back on so there you go
that that could be another software okay
yep that could be so yeah I dominic i
don't know i don't think i don't think
microsoft would ever not charge for an
operating system I just don't think
that's in their corporate DNA from
Christopher miles were you disappointed
by the Apple watch design no I kind of
liked it yeah I was all right yeah I
ain't until I play it with one in person
it's hard to say I mean it did look a
little chunky but you know when you're
looking at on a computer screen you
don't know a hundred percent for sure
right um find some breaking news for
people while we're on the podcast okay
t-mobile just announced its pricing for
the iphone 6 and iphone 6 plus so here
you go iphone 6 it's 16 gigs is a zero
dollars down with a monthly payment of
$27 iphone 6 but 64 is a hundred dollars
down with 128 200 otters down all with
twenty seven dollars and eight cents a
month and then the iphone 6 plus 16 64
128 zero dollars ninety nine dollars and
199 all upfront and then all with
monthly payments of 31 24 or thur
125 for 24 months so there you have it
whoo mobile customers here they just
just crossed the wire from someone that
I'm not even going to try because it's
all sorts of long for a name but what is
the best cheap SmartWatch pebble yeah
yeah hands down pebble from Dan lages
would the Apple watch look better if it
were round we're an implicit really yeah
we ran a post earlier with an artist
conception of it it almost seems like it
was supposed to be round yeah I thought
it looked better yeah I haven't worn a
square watch I mean I have the g one g
watch but i mean like a square root
square to watch in a long time like by
my own choice so I don't know more of a
round watch guy from Teheran sorensen do
you get anything extra for your 100
bucks when you get an iphone six-plus
besides a bigger screen yes you get
optic image stabilization on the camera
as opposed to digital image
stabilization which actually is a very
big deal because that means that the
camera floats within the module so it's
actually a far better image
stabilization system but apparently it's
not great for moving objects i was
reading a story on the verge today about
it which was really interesting about
how capturing moving objects like a dog
running around actually is not good with
though is so ab that yeah but yeah there
is a slight bit of technology difference
between the two devices besides just the
larger screen from al Hopsin your
thoughts on the protruding cameras on
the iphones seems without a case it will
be wobbly on a table or something we
actually wondered about that on apple
day they just called apple day now it's
like a national holiday yeah I mean I
again I mean it's not that large of a
protrusion but Joey actually was the
first one to ask that during the live
stream goes
I lay it on a table type is it gonna
wobble and I guess we'll all find out
next Friday hmm yeah when we all could
ever leave my phone on table to type but
I could see like maybe they're going to
be annoying like if you just put it down
just rocking around now uh let's see we
got bunch of questions let me burn
through a bunch of a real quick a mole
in the show here from Christopher miles
is it just me or does android were
seemed like the more streamlined
interface aah siren Claire doesn't feel
streamline to me it feels like freaking
mess yeah I have to agree taught here
too and that's not a sphere fanboyism
ton I both own Android wear watches and
I forgot my pebble on the kitchen table
today but I have not worn my G watch in
weeks I hate the thing hey absolutely
not like the Moto 360 looks better and
stuff but but navigating it just drives
me nuts yeah now it just like I guide it
and I know how it works I know that you
swipe up and swipe left and right to get
deeper into notifications I get it all I
just hate it the way it operates just
doesn't make sense now Android wear is
not remotely streamlined I'm afraid yeah
and look nerdy yeah looks cool I mean if
you want to do something to like I'm
swiping through try to like check my
heart rate it's very like you have the
best way to do anything is to use your
voice and then that relies on it
actually picking up what you said and
you knowing the right command and that's
kind of just really frustrating yeah uh
from Isaac Abraham I would wager if any
other company besides apple created the
design of the Apple watch it would be
laughed off as a fail what do you guys
think mmm-hmm I'm not thoroughly watches
the smart watches right now you could
contact what we were just talking about
scary really focused on on the software
and I think Apple should decent-looking
software and I think they showed premium
such premium looking model said i don't
i don't think anybody would have laughed
it off i mean when you look at the worst
android wear watches their plastic right
so if Apple had a pure plastic device
and that was it that maybe people would
be like what the heck I mean because now
you have the moto 360 and you have the g
watch our that are metal and so I think
I mean the polished look of the Apple
watch I don't think would have been
laughed at if anybody launched it no I
mean I love the design of the 360 I I
think it's a gorgeous looking watch it
it's just unfortunate it runs Android
wear yeah you tell we really did not
like it though we're gonna give it I
mean I'm still wearing it giving oh yeah
I'm just you know and everyone asked me
why I didn't sell my G watch because I
know there will be updates Android wear
that could potentially make it a far
better experience yeah sure and its
current iteration I don't care for the
second a major update comes train droid
where I will download the second it's
out put it on that G watch and give it a
whole nother shot the right now this is
not about the watch it is about the
software right yeah um let's see here
but uh oh here's a nokia question will
Microsoft nokia released a 15-30 or 1030
after the lackluster or Aoife
announcements yeah I can see what you
think the announcement city for were
lackluster but I actually really like
the 830 and its price point 300
something bucks it's actually a really
nice phone but I get it it's not you
know it's on a flagship I think we will
see updates to these phones particular
I'd like to see something with the tent
10 20 days update to you know whether
it's a 1030 or whatever and I hope so
but you know recent rumors are
suggesting that we're going to move
towards microsoft branded so it'll be
like Microsoft Lumia which makes sense
because nokia wasn't talked about very
much alpha as a brand although they had
you know they had like the charging
plate stuff which is obviously a nokia
product 15-30 another interesting
question I don't know um I really 15-30
for me was like really big up curious on
on how well it's selling as opposed to
say
something like the 930 which to me seems
to do better with the whole windows
that's just me yeah okay just one more
question then we'll we'll get a pure
from so I Raj is iphone 6 plus the iPad
