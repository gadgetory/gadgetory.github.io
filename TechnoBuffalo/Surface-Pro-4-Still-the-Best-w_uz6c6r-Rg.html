from TechnoBuffalo here I've been a big
fan of the surface Pro liner since the
first one I felt like it was a work in
progress they said like really gotten
better and better culminating with this
guy the surface pro 4 it's been about 4
months our review hit if you want to
give that video watch well link it here
and link it down below my experience on
it were generally positive we tested it
for gaming we tested it for ordinary
work process and we tested it for HD
playback and multitasking and it handled
everything with a plum since we've done
that review I brought the computer home
this has been my only computer at my
house I'm running the business from home
with this and I do everything I do on
ordinary computer at home with the
surface pro force my opinions on have
changed a little bit and a lot of ways
stayed the same this is a refresher the
unit that we have here is the i-5 a
gigabyte model so sort of mid high end
of the road let's talk first about the
newest type cover which I still say
should absolutely be included in the box
the key throw on it is way better than
the previous version it feels more like
ordinary keyboard mechanism for catching
it still the same so magnetic still I'll
be satisfying and still surprisingly
strong typing feels good I don't have
any flex in it as I'm typing one issue
that I ran into though since the review
is the trackpad my initial impressions
that it worked really well but about a
month after the review went up the
trackpad surges plug-in out on me
despite in the settings have a
sensitivity set up almost all the way to
high it was tracking really slow so I
wanted to scroll from one corner the
other app to swipe my finger like four
or five times to get up there I fixed it
I think I had a reset and reboot a few
times but it does come back occasionally
once a week or so the weird track
patches will come back and I'll
disconnect the the keyboard put it back
on sometimes it'll be fixed sometimes
not I am still loving Cortana and find
myself asking her questions all the time
just talking to it like I would my phone
that's been a really helpful feature in
one I thought was little gimmicky when I
first reviewed it but I found myself
using all the time asking the weather
tasking the scores asking when baseball
season starting whatever it might be I'm
actually asking her a lot of questions
Windows hello is the ability to use
potentially your rent
as to unlock the device still seems like
a freaking magic trick to me every time
I use it it works well it's awesome and
it works fast I've had no issues with it
at all my home usage is pretty simple
actually have a docking station from the
surface pro 3 they don't make the sort
of big station anymore for a surface pro
line but it works with the 4 so I've got
this set up to an lg widescreen monitor
it's worked really well so let's say I'm
using this as a desktop I'd also take
with me I'm going somewhere going over
to my visit my parents my grandparents I
take my whole computer with me and it's
sidon like certainly you get with a
laptop to the experience just been
really cool I have not used the pen at
all I find very little utility behind it
I'm not in school taking notes I don't
really use OneNote at all so that's been
a non-factor but does it sit on the side
of the computer build quality is held up
as well new shoes with the hinge hasn't
gotten loose on me and I'll be able to
put it in different positions and if I
myself actually doing it some positions
as well know what you're gonna say what
I do and it works extremely well for me
I've done some light gaming I don't do
that much booming on it we'll see just a
little Starcraft 2 acting here there and
no she's with it at all performance is
been absolutely fine battery life has
held up to since the review same that I
have and did the initial one I'm able to
go through about six ish hours depending
on how I manage the battery but have
been a really positive experience would
I get this again yes in a heartbeat
I would still recommend the surface pro
for fact I recommended probably over the
surface book didn't see review the
surface book to check that out Ron and I
both took the surface book with us to
CES I used it just I use a computer he
is editing machine so you can see our
experience on it this has just been a
really good computer they don't have the
power when I need it the portability
when I want it I want to make the
surface pro line so pretty sweet to me
what do you guys think by the surface
pro for my pinch review are mostly true
with the few sort of annoyances that I
found over the past few months
anyway cue the video thumbs up it was
appreciate it until next time i'm jeremy
from TechnoBuffalo
and i'll talk to you the next video
