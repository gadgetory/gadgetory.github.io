Freda you guys usually don't see me
because I'm actually behind the camera
filming editing a lot for John but John
and I are the resident car guys you're
TechnoBuffalo and about three weeks ago
Mazda gave us an mx-5 for review so I
asked if I could set up in front of the
camera and give you guys a review so
let's get started before we get started
just a quick disclaimer for you guys Maz
is actually just announced a 2016 mx-5
miata with the change exterior and
interior so bear that in mind when
you're watching this review so we're
gonna breaking this review up into a
couple sections first we're gonna do
design that's gonna be the interior and
the exterior we're gonna look at the
drive in terms of the powertrain the
handling and day to day use price point
where this car fits into the market it's
some of its competitors and then a bunch
of miscellaneous things kind of pros and
cons that we liked and didn't like about
the car they don't really fit into a
category and we're gonna finish with
overall opinions and thoughts on the car
alright so to start off with the
exterior design it's a good-looking car
I don't want to be rude about it it's
definitely not an ugly car it is a bit
feminine all of us in the office kind of
agree driving around in public we did
kind of you know slouched down a little
bit cuz we wanted to avoid being seen
Mazda did make an effort to make it a
little more aggressive we have to give
them credit for that but it's kind of
like having a poodle as a guard dog it
just doesn't really work and we've said
this before Mazda has our cars which
kind of they kind of smile on the front
so they don't really look at that
intimidating on the bright side they're
happy I guess so that's that's a good
thing in regards to interior design this
has to be by far the weakest point of
the car it's plasticy all over the place
it's kind of a weird layout and and
outdated is probably the best word to
describe it
couple oddities are that the handbrake
is actually on the other side so you
kind of have to reach around and get
oddly close to the passenger's leg to
pull the handbrake I don't really do
handbrake turns and stuff like that but
considering it's a sports car that might
be an issue for some of you who do kind
of more enthusiastic driving with
handbrake hearing and stuff like that
another thing is the cupholders and the
power windows are located just kind of
where your forearm lands so when you're
shifting a lot of the times if you have
a cup you'll end up hitting the cup and
lowering the windows all at the same
time so it's not really the best layout
like I said this is
one of the weaker points of the car John
did also have issues with getting into
the car his birthday was last week so
this might be him getting old I
personally had no issues in terms of
ergonomics and driving position and
stuff like that it's great once you're
in but bear in mind this car is very
very low to the ground so you do kind of
have to you know bend down to get in
it's not as bad when the top is down
then when the top is up you kind of need
to bend your head down a little bit more
not the biggest deal but just I'm going
to bear in mind if you're really tall so
now let's move on to the drive will
start with power train this car is a
2-liter four-cylinder engine putting out
167 horsepower 140 pounds feet of torque
it is rear-wheel drive so front engine
it's a great setup one thing we all kind
of really noticed was that this car
really wants to be driven hard the
engine idles very high and the engine a
combination of the gearing ratio it just
it just revs really really high for no
reason I mean the only way to really
comfortably shift is at about 3,000 rpm
if the car just really wants you to
drive it which is which is awesome
because that's kind of the goal of this
car it is a sports car it's not really a
cruiser which I'll get to later you kind
of just really need to wring it out but
the one downside of this is going at
freeway speeds you would think that okay
I'd be able to cruise but once you're in
sixth gear going at about 65 70 miles an
hour you're already at three thousand
three and a half thousand rpm it almost
feel like the car needs another gear
just kind of just kind of an odd thing
that makes it a little bit uncomfortable
at highway cruising speeds so integral
to handling this is probably the best
point of the car the first thing I
noticed when getting in was that the
steering was super super tight it's it's
a perfectly balanced car rear wheel
drive front engine handles great I
didn't notice when I looked at the car
that there was very narrow rear tires
initially which I thought might be a
problem or a benefit depending on how
you like to drive having to back-end
kind of let go and that sort of stuff
but the power to grip ratio because it's
such a low powered car it's pretty
fantastic it's a very manageable car if
you floor it half way through a corner
you'll get a little bit of slip but it's
very easy to catch it's not gonna try to
kill you if you're going for precision
driving it's very easy to maintain the
car in control and situations the
situation doesn't get very hairy another
thing is there is no understeer with
this car me and John can talk about this
as well it's it's such a well setup car
can't really overstate it this cars
really popular amongst track-day
enthusiasts just because the setup is so
great they I know a lot of people who
have spec racing cars based off of older
Miatas or the mx-5 they take the car
they tune it up to get more power out of
it and they kind of make the most of
installing roll cages different
suspension and that sort of thing and
mentioning stiffer suspension also one
thing I did notice was that the chassis
is a little bit looser than the steering
itself this makes it feel like you're
kind of slipping from corner to corner
which is a great feeling when you're
really going at it through a canyon or
something like that
the lack of chassis stiffness maybe down
in fact it's convertible so you lose a
little bit of structural rigidity but
again it's not really a bad thing it's
just something I noticed
so with this car being geared so much
towards performance and being this great
sports car and great handling
characteristics and everything you do
lose on the day-to-day
usability of it it's a little bit rough
around the edges there's a lot of road
noise tire noise with the top up bear in
mind so when you put the top down to be
honest it's really not that bad you kind
of expect the noise and it's a great
experience driving convertible we live
in California so we're fortunate enough
to be able to do that like eight months
out of the year easily like drive at the
top down but if you live somewhere else
I assume it's gonna be about 50/50 and
you're gonna have to drive at the top up
and it's really not that smooth of an
experience
price points a really important thing
with this car and ours was a hardtop
Grand Touring version which came in at
twenty-nine thousand four hundred fifty
dollars the soft-top version of the car
comes in at twenty-three thousand nine
hundred and seventy dollars of course it
depends on how you spec in all that
stuff to me this cars competing with the
Scion fr-s which I've driven and I'm a
big fan of I can't say driving dynamics
wise the FRS is better because this car
is fantastic the main thing is the FRS
is a lot more refined in the places that
this car is not the interior feels a lot
less clunky a lot less outdated it's not
a luxury car by any means but this car
really isn't that great in that
department and it doesn't look feminine
at all it looks pretty aggressive the
FRS does so a couple miscellaneous
things and we have to bring this up even
though we were overall really happy with
the car Ralph actually took the car for
a car wash and he did mention and this
is pretty worrying that the car started
leaking a little bit of water nothing
too crazy but it did start leaking water
note this may be just an issue with our
press car
which also may have led to the
additional road noise so I really
recommend going and test driving the car
yourself and getting a feel for it and
seeing if it's really for you another
thing is the car does have a very small
trunk really isn't that big of an issue
because you kind of know what you're
getting into but it is something to bear
in mind you also do get very poor fuel
economy considering the incredibly small
engine you think of two liter
four-cylinder engine would give you
great fuel economy but it it really
doesn't because the engine is kind of
revving out all the time so overall this
is a small cheap sports car that wants
to be wrapped out driven hard
I mean Mazda definitely knew what they
were doing with this car and so I can't
really knock them for not having all the
amenities that some of its competitors
might have or being as smooth or as
luxurious as some of the other
competitors might have it knows what it
is there's no clutter the downside is
you don't get a very practical car or a
very economical one you do get a
hard-edged sports car that's really
really fun and comes in a fun sized
package it's not pretending to be
anything that's not and so for that I
give it a 7 out of 10
