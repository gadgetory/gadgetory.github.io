from TechnoBuffalo and today we'll be
doing an unboxing of the new Amazon Fire
HD 6 in black this is one of Amazon's
newest addition to the Fire tablet
series the cheapest one actually and
it's only going for $99 so let's jump in
and see what's inside the box so jumping
straight into the box we are greeted
with Amazon smiley logo and there's
really nothing else around the box and
right below that is where we can peel
off the little tabs so let's just go
ahead and do that all right we got the
tabs off let's open this bad boy up and
see what's inside so this is the Fire HD
6 which looks really small and it's
pretty light as well let's just put this
aside real quick and see what else is
inside the box and other than that we
have a getting started guide which has
all your basic information about the
tablet and we also have a USB cable here
for charging and the wall ward so
getting back into the device the Fire HD
6 is running a quad-core processor which
consists of 2 1.5 gigahertz cores and
two lower power 1.2 gigahertz cores
running simultaneously for optimal load
balancing and power efficiency
now the Fire HD 6 also comes with 1
gigabyte of RAM and options of either 8
gigabyte or 16 gigabyte of internal
storage
now the Fire HD 6 also features a 1280
by 800 resolution which honestly looks
pretty good for a tablet in this price
range and according to Amazon the Fire
HD 6 is 2 times faster than the previous
generation Fire HD now the Fire HD 6
also features 2 cameras a 2 megapixel
rear facing camera which can film in
1080p and a front facing camera for
Skype calls or taking selfies but other
than that it also features a 3400
milliamp battery which lasts about 8 or
so hours and it's also packin a Dolby
Digital mono speaker which sounds pretty
good for a tablet this size and it's
running an all new fire OS 4 which
introduces an updated visual design and
exclusive new features including family
library profiles smart suspend and more
so before we end this video we just
wanted to quickly compare the
Fire HD 6 - the older Amazon Kindle Fire
HD as you can see the screen difference
here 6 inches 7 inches here and the
thickness now the Fire HD 6 is
definitely meant to be held in portrait
mode rather than in landscape like the
older Fire HD screen is much smaller you
have your power button here at the top
with your microUSB port you have your
microphone and three-and-a-half
millimeter headphone jack and on the
left side is where you can find your
volume buttons on the back you have your
2 megapixel camera that can film in
1080p and your front-facing camera here
anyways that's it for this quick
