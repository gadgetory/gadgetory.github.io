TechnoBuffalo and budget phones are the
trend right now from one plus two
anything and everything in between
when the price is right you guys and I
will buy so what blue has done in
collaboration with Amazon is take budget
phones to the next level with the r1 HD
they have released a phone for $50
unlocked with ads that's right with ads
I wanted to see what the phone was like
from a hardware perspective but most
importantly see what the ad experience
was like can you use a phone that has
built-in ads yes or no let's go head and
get started the majority of the specs
here are really not that noteworthy
you're looking at a 5 inch HD curved
display which sounds awesome until you
realize that HD means 720p and curved
means curved where there are black bars
there's no actual pixels there so this
is not some cheap Samsung Galaxy s7 edge
unfortunately the 1.3 gigahertz in one
gig of ram do show after you use the
phone a little bit after having a couple
apps open and having a couple usages and
having some of the RAM used up the phone
does slow down a decent bit it's not
unusable but it's definitely not as fast
as a flagship however that was to be
expected the low point of this phone was
definitely the cameras however both
cameras looked absolutely terrible I was
partially excited for the 5 megapixel
front-facing camera because it has an
LED flash
however disappointingly is a snapchat
and Instagram user the front-facing LED
flash doesn't work with those app you
can only use the actual front-facing
flash in their native camera app so if
that means something to you it's pretty
cool but it doesn't really mean much to
me because the cameras at the end of the
day aren't very good I do feel bad
ripping on the phone given that it's
only 50 dollars for hardware I mean what
were you expecting in this price range
but I will say for the positive things
the feel of the phone is great it's a
little bit on the thicker side but the
texture on the back is awesome and it
feels really really good to hold and use
now the main question that you're all
dying to find the answer to or at least
I would hope so if you're watching this
video is can you use a phone with ads
now the ads in this experience are not
going to be popping up all over the
place I'm not going to be interrupting
something you're doing they're going to
be integrated into the wallpaper so when
you unlock the phone there will be an ad
there as the background or as a
notification I'm assuming depending on
how much the advertiser paid I actually
really didn't mind these ads and here's
why they're all
through Amazon I'm a huge Amazon user
I'm a big prime advocate I love their
services
I think Amazon's algorithms of
recommending products are superb because
of that every time I got a product
recommendation I wasn't really mad given
that it was a good product or something
that I would buy or be interested in and
also it doesn't slow you down in your
experience and usage of the phone it
just gives you a quick glance at some
dub soap or at any deodorant or
something along those lines depending on
your purchase history on Amazon and
that's really it for this video guys
obviously the hardware on this phone is
not fantastic it was not supposed to be
the best I mean it's $50 I don't really
want to complain about that it's just
something to bear in mind I don't want
you guys going and buying something like
this and comparing Atul oneplus it's
obviously not going to be as good
the main question I had in that I was
trying to answer was our ads feasible in
a phone using experience and absolutely
I think blue knocked it out of the park
I think Amazon does a great job with AD
recommendations on products I could see
myself using a phone even at the higher
end that has ads in the future if it
takes a couple hundred dollars off of my
price tag initially I think it's totally
worth it let me know what you guys think
in the comments down below is this
something you'd be willing to adopt to
to save a couple hundred dollars when
you buy a phone or whatever your
currency is I'm very curious to hear let
me know in the comments down below give
us a thumbs up if you like this video
and I'll see you guys in the next one
thank you so much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
