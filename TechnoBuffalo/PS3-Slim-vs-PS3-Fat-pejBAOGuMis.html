TechnoBuffalo here with a comparison
video for you of the new ps3 slim vs.
well I guess we can only call the old
ps3 fat that's the 60 gigabyte version
there on the right let's go ahead and
check out the size of these two and see
how they stack up from the side and the
front of the device you can't see that
there are pretty big differences
especially in the girth of it when you
look at the top that's really where it's
most noticeable the substantial
thickness here not so thick right there
size is obviously the big difference
between these two consoles the ps3 slim
is quite obviously much slimmer but you
probably knew that let's take a look at
the design of the two and see really
where some of the differences lie
so we'll lay both of them flat again
take the fatty version which is much
heavier action tell you by the way
then the slim guy and here is kind of
where you can start to see some of the
bigger differences on the slim you've
actually got physical buttons for eject
and power on on the older outgoing ps3
model these are actually touch sensitive
buttons for eject and power on so that's
sort of one change that they made also
it's both of them are still front
loading this one sword I always have an
upward tilt this one looks a little more
flush both have two USB ports that are
found down below so - right there -
right they're both on the right hand
side and devices if we turn them around
you can start to see a little more
difference as well and you can also see
the size between the table
so on the fatty ps3 you take a look at
the back and the ports that are
available here you've got that Sony
proprietary video cable that connects
two component composite whatever you
want
you've got your optical out HDMI
Ethernet power and the power port and
the power on/off switch on the back of
the ps3 slim you've got through that
same array of ports but the only thing
that's missing is the power switch so
that's gone when you plug it in and you
turn it on it's turned on there's no
need for it on/off interestingly enough
even though this doesn't have a power
switch to be turned off it does use
significantly less power than the fat
version so from an aesthetic standpoint
it's really gonna depend on what you
prefer whether you like the piano black
sort of glossy feel fingerprint magnet
of the outgoing ps3 whether you prefer
the slim sort of matte feel of the new
slim version they both do exactly the
same thing this one has a little bigger
hard drive but they're both user
replaceable so you can put them on an
even keel definitely to come to a
personal preference both are gonna run
you $2.99 and I think a very fair price
is $2.99 think that you're getting one
of the best firmware upgradeable blu-ray
players I also get the ability to play
games if that's your thing so guys hope
