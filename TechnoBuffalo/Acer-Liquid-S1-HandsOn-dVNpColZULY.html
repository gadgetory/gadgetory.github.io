checking out the Acer Liquid s1 is
really interesting device it's huge this
is a giant 5.7 inch screen 1280 by 720 p
resolution we're running Android 4.2.2
so not quite Android 4.3 but still jelly
bean so it's all good let's check out
some of the physical aspects of the
device if you're into large phones I
know John loves big phones so he'll love
something like this it's cut an 8
megapixel shooter on the back and a 2
megapixel front-facing camera the
designs really interesting there's some
sort of cutouts here like where the
earpiece is also on the sides here it
almost actually kind of indents in and
then the volume rocker here is actually
raised a little bit so I have to be
honest not a huge fan of the sleep
button which is on this side of the
phone so if you hold the phone with your
hand it does make it easy to access but
the thing is is it is really flush on
there I mean there is very little
differentiation as to what is the side
of the phone and what is the sleep
button so if you're not directly looking
at it you can really easily miss it it's
got 8 gigs of on-board storage it
actually is dual SIM so if you are true
a world traveler it's always good to
have two SIM cards laying around dual
Sims I actually really liked their
widgets I like what Acer serve done with
their widgets which is really nice
pretty standard Android user experience
here the UI pretty crisp although
there's some delay like when I've opened
a couple of apps some custom apps here
Acer print Acer cloud generally speaking
a pretty standard Android experience but
one of the things that I noticed is that
it doesn't actually auto move things so
unlike the note 3 you're not going to be
able to automatically kind of shift
things over it'll just tell you nope no
more room on this particular homescreen
and send you right back to widgets this
particular phone has a gig of ram you're
also going to have a 1.5 gigahertz
quad-core processor it's powered by
MediaTek actually
so a little bit different than the
standard you know snapdragons I do like
the soft plastic on the back but I would
imagine after a while I probably get a
little fingerprint II will be having
more coverage from the show floor here
at IFA in Berlin so leave your comments
