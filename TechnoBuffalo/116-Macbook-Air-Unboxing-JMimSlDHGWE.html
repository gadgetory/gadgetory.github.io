from TechnoBuffalo here with an unboxing
of the brand new just redesigned mid
2010 MacBook Air this is the 11.6 model
this might sound familiar actually unbox
this guy a few days ago that was just a
press review unit this one is actually
one that I purchased for myself I did do
a few upgrades it's got the 1.6
gigahertz Intel Core 2 Duo chip that's
an upgrade over the 1.4 for $100 and I
doubled the RAM to 4 gigs for another
hundred dollars which brings a total of
a particular model to just about $1400
and it comes with 128 gigabyte flash
memory so without further ado let's go
ahead and bust out all stabby and go
ahead and get started
so unfortunately the press model had to
go back so this one is mine to keep we
will cut the seal here this is a custom
order in the 11.6 inch model go ahead
and try not to slice my finger which is
always more difficult than it sounds
there we go
hopefully that'll be enough to rip this
open there you go MacBook Air it's
extremely small box and a much larger
cardboard container the last piece of
tape there we go
and again this meatloaf got familiar if
you saw the previous unboxing go ahead
and pull this out alright we'll go ahead
and pull that out here is the 11.6 inch
MacBook Air and sort of a bonus unboxing
at the end will unbox the MacBook Air
super Drive alright so we have the 11.6
inch model here it's got a picture of it
on the front this version does not have
the SD card slot that's only found on
the 13 gig model so go ahead and see
what else we got MacBook Air on this
side Apple logo I'm living you know once
again two MacBook Air in case you forgot
and then here are some of the specs on
it yet again I would go ahead and sort
of review these here MacBook Air 11
point 6 1.6 gigahertz with 128 flash and
this has the NVIDIA GeForce 320 m
graphics alright so we will use the big
ol knife one more time to cut some
plastic there we go and that should be
just enough to pull this off
all right so go ahead and push it off to
the side let's take off the top and here
is the MacBook Air it's always makes you
nervous to have to sort of tilt that
there we go so push that off to the side
for just a moment and we'll see what
else we're gonna get in the box
you've got your pretty much standard now
Mac charger it's the MagSafe adapter
with sort of magnetic connection port
you can see it right there and this is
the extension cord if you want to make
the cord a bit longer designed by Apple
in California and this does not come
with actually a restore DVDs
interestingly enough it does come with
however a restore USB Drive quite
interesting enough so it says hello
there it is MacBook Air software
reinstall Drive and I actually ordered
this with the dongle for USB to Ethernet
so push all that sort of stuff off to
the side the non exciting stuff and
let's take a look at the MacBook Air
herself all right so here it is sort of
a very very thin profile thing weighs I
think under 2.3 pounds you're gonna get
about 5 hours of battery life on the
11.6 inch model where 7 hours of actual
really usage battery life on the 13-inch
on the left-hand side there is that
MagSafe adapter one USB port audio and
you actually use that for a microphone
as well and there is sort of an external
microphone not sort of it is on the
other side we've got another USB port
and a micro DisplayPort for powering up
to echo 27 inch external cinema display
the back is not user accessible that's
where those rubber feet let's go ahead
and open this guy up come off the
plastic broke the seal literally and
figuratively
and let's take a look at the keyboard it
sort of feels very much like a hybrid of
a netbook and a standard laptop because
of the size however a power standpoint
it's relatively nicely spec for
something this size maybe I'll let you
do whatever it is need to do including
some like World of Warcraft s gaming on
on low settings so certainly not meant
to be a gaming laptop they certainly are
paying a premium over what you would pay
for a comparable expect Windows PC
you're paying a bit extra for the size
and portability I'm gonna pull that off
this does not have the glass-to-glass
edge display that their other Mac books
have so looks a little bit interesting
the keyboard actually extends out past
the monitor itself interesting
interestingly enough to the 11.6 inch is
actually the first MacBook with a
widescreen display orientation previous
MacBooks I do not have that the power
button is now actually part of the
keyboard you can see it right there and
this does not have a backlit keyboard
you can see that by the empty f5 key
which ordinarily would control the
backlit keyboard the trackpad is now
sort of similar to what we've seen on
the other macbook lines they don't have
that button anymore
you now have sort of a full larger
multi-touch trackpad which can be
clicked
all right so speaking of resolution the
11.6 has a resolution of 1366 by 768
which really makes this guy a very
strong competitor
especially at its entry price point of
$9.99 for the entry-level a plastic
white MacBook you're gonna get a
relatively decent spec machine this will
do some light video editing will do some
light gaming but for everyday internet
usage sending email watching YouTube
videos watching Hulu so that's up this
is going to be a very very uh perhaps
over the capable computer in a really
small package so we'll continue the
MacBook Air coverage that we started
earlier in the week so be sure to stay
tuned to the channel which is John for
Lakers and TechnoBuffalo for all that
news in the meantime let's take a look
at the SuperDrive that's going to
accompany the MacBook Air since it does
not ship
with an internal optical drive so here
is a super drive it's gonna set you back
just about $80 we will once again you
see more stab Oh to cut the plastic here
at least try and cut the plastic there
we go
go ahead and open this up the plastic
off to the side MacBook Air super drive
and this is pretty much all there is to
it super drive with the USB port and you
get a bit of software in there but it's
pretty much just plug and play I know
guys that is it I'm John rendering
TechnoBuffalo I'll see you the next
video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
