TechnoBuffalo and I'm in Mustang land
behind me is a GT the new 2013 model
we're going to check out the new GT here
in Portland Oregon at the Ford event and
then we're going to take one on the road
stay tuned buckle your seat belts and
put the pedal to the male
new for 2013 are standard HID headlights
and we've also got two LED strips that
will stay on all day and all night
the front and rear fascias of the
Mustang have also been redesigned we
have a more prominent grille and a more
prominent splitter the GTS 5.0 liter v8
engine has also been boosted to 420
horsepower however when you compare that
to the Shelby Cobra this year Shelby
Cobra has 650 ponies cranking under the
hood Ford also added grille vents to the
hood helping the engine breathe a little
bit better this is called staying true
to classic Mustang heritage Ford is also
offering a number of new customizable
wheels nice Ford's aluminum I love this
stealthy black set one of the coolest
things about the new Mustangs lives on
the inside by an available 4.2 inch LCD
productivity screen we can use track
apps track apps monitor all sorts of
things they can tell you how fast you're
going from zero to 60 they can give you
your g-forces around curves they also
have an accelerometer which measures
your braking and all sorts of other
driving performance aspects one of the
options on the new Mustangs are Recaro
seats you can get them in fabric or of
course the more expensive leather if you
want to rock out in your new Mustang
Ford has you covered with shaker audio
they said it's pretty insane they said
it's crystal clear let's do a little
audio test shall we first we'll do a
little pairing with bluetooth here we're
going to choose the laser phone
that sounds pretty clear to me oh yeah
raise the roof oh yeah
raise the roof we're gonna
this may be a little bit obsessive but
the side view mirrors on the new Ford
Mustang have a light inside them and
they will project the pony the Prancing
Pony on to the ground when you open the
door open the door and the pony follows
now that is cool and then you close the
door and it fades away bad ass alright
I'm not going to tease you any longer
let's go drive one this ladies and
gentlemen is our ride for today Mustang
5.0 GT
you throw the pedal down right once the
v8 truly engages past two grand two
grand or 2500 its hell's chorus being
unleashed upon the asphalt jokes
we just oh my god
so I just came up to a four-way stop and
completely completely the the rear end
broke loose and we just completely spun
out and did a burnout in front of
everybody at the four-way traffic light
this is a shot of the accelerometer and
track apps let's accelerate
now we break you can see that little
ball that little red ball flying around
and pretty much measuring our g-forces
driving a Mustang rules except when you
get stuck behind a school bus
I've won on a Mustang since I was a kid
and this is a magical occasion this car
is so smooth even around corners I was a
little concerned because I thought this
is more of a drag car but you can still
rail corners with this Mustang I don't
know what else to say about it there's
really not much else you could say
doctor testing the brakes they're
testing the brakes they work
it's got bite it's got power it's got
growl it'll take you by the scruff of
the neck and punch you in the face the
Ford Mustang GT 2013 blue yeah for more
on this go to TechnoBuffalo calm this is
Mike Pearlman for TechnoBuffalo I've got
more burnouts to do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
