feel too boring but I thought some of
you guys might want to see it if not no
big deal um I bought spore origins for
the iphone actually really enjoyed it

great game and talked me into it I
figured I'm gonna give it a whirl it's
actually the only game i have for the
mac or pc for that matter it's my way
computer game so let's give it a real
quick world do the old unboxing tour and
see it says spore on the front picture
of some of the creatures spore on the
side on the back you got some pictures
and a little bit about the game create
volve spore and share but the game it's
about is you create a little bit create
a little creature and you watch them
grow and evolve throughout the game to
create your own civilizations and
villages that kind of stuff so we'll go
ahead give it a lil bit of a world get
open up the front some more sport
