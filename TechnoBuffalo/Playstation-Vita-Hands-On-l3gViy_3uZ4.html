TechnoBuffalo year with the first time
hands-on of the pretty high coming out
hopefully at some point P as a Vita this
is the next generation of PlayStation
Portable consoles almost powerful as a
ps3 or ps4 powerful so let's take a
quick look first it's a little bit on
the thicker side but I gotta say the
device is extremely light I'm assuming
it's being powered by this guy so
there's not a battery in there but it
really feels nice in the hand there
touch panels here on the back responsive
you can put a nice little grip when you
hold it touch pad seem very sponsored so
we're playing a little big planet here
you can see Zach boy doing this thing
quits adenylate I had a friend in
college we had he hit the same dick name
but for very different reasons like
let's go ahead take a look here we've
got your up-down left-right your typical
player controls two analog sticks
since the PlayStation mini here and see
if we can get well they may have locked
us out from checking out the menu system
and it looks like they did so we our
games only here feels pretty nice though
man got the two shoulder buttons
feels very very very celibates is
definitely not gonna be an advice you're
gonna throw in some tight jeans pockets
but definitely wear a little bit on the
back gear side you got a bag this is
gonna be an awesome companion so we
can't see the multi-touch display we
can't see much about the touchscreen
here
this demonstration is only about
LittleBigPlanet so we'll show that there
graphics do look very impressive the
screen is popping there's a lot of
direct sunlight coming right into the
when we're filming and there's still a
pretty high angle of visibility so if
you're worried about playing outdoors or
you want to send the part and get your
game on
you're not really gonna have to worry
here very impressed with us one of the
non-text I have in the original PSP so
it's the next generation of course the
PS Vita also was more than I could
contribute I see other than some
gameplay stuff but you can see sackboy
doing this thing he's jumping around
I don't feel be jumping around with your
PS Vita hopefully sometime around the
holiday season so he's yet to say much
about anything so I am John Breton drew
from TechnoBuffalo live from IFA 2011
but they first look and first hands-on
and do it right there hands-on literally
of these sony PS Vita see you guys in
next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
