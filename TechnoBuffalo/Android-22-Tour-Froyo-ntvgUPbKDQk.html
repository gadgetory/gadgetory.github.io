TechnoBuffalo here and I want to show
you some of the new features found in
Android 2.2 you may also hear it called
Froyo it follows Google's sort of
dessert themed updates the first one we
saw was cupcake for a C then we saw
donut Eclair Froyo with an F so sort of
de a quill CG and all the rest of the
desserts as Google starts kicking out
more updates so let's jump in to a
feature that I think was really really
needed we've now have new shortcut
widgets on the home screen so you can
jump right to the dialer go back to your
applications or go right to the web
really nice happy to have them there you
also have a new tips widget which you
can delete very easily that sort of
shows up when you first flash the device
when you want to delete something those
down below go away and the trashcan
shows up so the next thing that we have
is now flash 10.1 and actually doesn't
come on the ROM when your phone gets the
actually have to download the beta from
the Android Market let me show you how
flash works here on Android 2.1 this
actually works pretty well so i've got
now some flash games to tap PL just pick
one you can see some Flash content
playing right there go ahead just pick a
random game we'll see how things look
like just like all flash you still get
popups which can certainly be a bit on
the annoying side so we'll go ahead and
X out of that and start the game if so
you can get as sort of a feel of how
Flash content works on here video
actually is much smoother than we saw on
say the HTC Incredible or other flash
naval devices this isn't flash lights
this is flash 10.1 you can see things
here double tap if you rotate it
oftentimes it'll rotate with you and
sometimes they'll even go fullscreen
depending on whether or not it's been
formatted for mobile you think things
are actually going very smooth and
surprisingly playable you can actually
use flash now on a mobile device
something that's really really nice
so you can see things are just sort of
playing like normal so go ahead and jump
out of this go ahead and quit that
so you have a cool couple other sort of
neat features here found in 2.1 the
first and probably one of the most
pronounced is browser speed a browser
speed is definitely improved there's
some new rendering engines that are
being done I'll give you a demonstration
from those sort of heart to appreciate
the speed increase if you haven't seen
the speed increase on the other devices
so go ahead and load up we'll pick
TechnoBuffalo go back to the web and
i'll show you how this works this is a
pretty fast Wi-Fi let's sort of get not
really sure to compare that something
else but just so you can see it there's
TechnoBuffalo pops up we'll go ahead and
let it load and things do load very
quickly so we'll go ahead and launch the
site I'm not saying on average about a
second to a second and a half faster
than I would see on the Nexus One with
Android 2.1 the previous build so
content loads very fast and you sort of
get your same multi-touch that you had
before but things work and things work
very well one of the other really handy
features and things I think your people
are really gonna like is inset it let me
show you what we got here jump on it the
settings go to wireless networks
you now have tethering and portable
hotspot suppose you don't know tethering
is essentially using your phone's
internet connection and sharing with
your computer so if you're out on the
road and you have your laptop with me
you don't have internet you can plug
your phone in and use it for your
internet connection it also something
else cool called portable Wi-Fi hotspot'
now not all phones are gonna get this
purple Wi-Fi hotspot but it does sprays
no explanatory turns your phone into a
Wi-Fi access point so actually turns
your cellular data
kicks it out as Wi-Fi actually up to
eight people can connect to it at once
certainly the more people that connect
the less faster speeds gonna be but it
does work and it worked really well so
you've got some decent amount of
settings here go ahead and turn this on
you can see what it looks like takes a
little bit of time you can see it says
turning on sort of grayed out down below
and about 10 or 15 seconds you are now
kicking out Wi-Fi see the little icon in
the upper left hand corner letting you
know that it's working you can check out
what some of the settings are pretty
self-explanatory and configure
you can set a password if you'd like or
not so the password is leave it open
really is very handy so let me go ahead
and turn that off and let's continue the
tour the camera features something else
has been updated here with Android 2.1
I'll show you what that looks like
go ahead and launch the application and
jump on into camera navigating the
camera I thought was a bit clumsy on
Android 2.1 how to use two hands here on
2.2 that actually optimized it for
one-handed use to actually take your
finger you roll over you get all these
options down you can do it right you're
taking your picture you can see that
you've got white balance you got your
zoom right there flash where you want to
store it to and some focus emotes you've
got a really decent amount of other
things that you can do here and speaking
of cameras something else has been
enabled the Nexus One these particularly
has an LED flash that LED flash will now
work when you are in video capture mode
so if you're in low-light situations and
even more light this is going to work
perfectly for you go ahead and jump back
to the home screen and let's keep going
on so you now also have some new search
functionality so you've got a new Google
logo there if you click it you can have
search Google when you start really
searches everything on your phone the
web apps or contacts now I server get a
universal search if you just want to do
a Google search on the web you go ahead
to web you want to search the
applications you don't have to jump now
into Android Marketplace or if you want
to search your contacts and speaking of
Android Marketplace you can now update
your applications all at once didn't
ever do them all individually which is
quite nice there's also some new
features for those of using exchange
service calendar sync and things like
that now work just better and soon there
will be a new online marketplace where
you can go ahead and manage all of your
Android applications and actually send
them right to the device from there but
that has not been launched yet so I just
hope you enjoyed this sort of quick
overview of Android 2.2 called Froyo
look for it on your Android device
coming soon you've seen them it's gonna
be coming to obviously the Nexus One
here droid and look for devices like the
Droid Incredible to get it soon as well
and you guys hope you enjoy - John
