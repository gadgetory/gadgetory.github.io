when you first joined Tesla is starting
to come to fruition we got a much bigger
picture of what all of that is going to
entail at the quarterly shareholders
meeting where we saw the very first
render leesneed peek of the upcoming
small crossover from Tesla the model y
and following along that'll mean Tesla
will have the Model X the model 3 which
looks like an e the Model X and the
model Y Elon Musk and company really
wanted it to spell out sexy for
wondering why it's Model 3 and not model
YZ board owns that trademarking and
threatened to sue so model wide we now
know a little bit more about it you want
to much first Jesus in 2015 we haven't
heard much since then Ted claimed it is
released in 2019 but in Tesla time it's
probably more likely twenty twenty or
twenty twenty-one it will not be based
on the model three platform that we
previously thought Elon claims they
learned a ton developing the Model X
they built that on the Model S platform
said it was disaster trying to build two
cars on the same platform so they're
going to go for entirely new
architecture for the model y will indeed
have Falcon wing doors been issue of
contention and I'll probably end up
looking like a smaller Model X and I
expected to probably come in higher than
the model three price point so expect
probably around fifty thousand when that
hits sometime in the next few years we
also learned a lot more about the model
three SS was finally getting ready to
push a configurator live and if you saw
what Tesla the figure eight is for the
Model S the model extras like aa
drooling to get your hands on all of
those options you're going to be picking
your interior colors and to be picking
all kinds of stuff you're going to be
out of luck the configurator is going to
be super simple when it comes online in
July pretty much is going to be color
and wheel size either 18 or 19 inches
and that's going to be it again
harkening back to the Model X you want a
much said they offered way too many
options and a really messed up their
supply lines so the model three launch
it's going to be a very simple car don't
know battery size yet really don't know
what the final price for the options are
going to be your options are going to be
bundled in and also you play jeweler
today you're listening
an 80 20 month wait to actually get your
car so bear that in mind that would be
enough of Tesla news but Elon Musk also
dropped some warnings about the Tesla
semi that was unveiled a little while
back there's going to be larger unveil
come September we'll know more about the
car and Tess was working with semi
drivers to make sure that this truck can
actually do what they needed to do we
don't know range or battery size or
anything else will be compatible
superchargers or have a modular battery
packs but you also may see that
something else and something new could
be housed the September event they talk
more about the truck so who knows what
it could be maybe we'll do like a Tesla
semi P like 5000 D and it would go 0 to
60 in like 4 seconds which is just
insane but it's kind of the insanity
that Tesla likes to do so we've got a
much bigger picture about Tesla's master
plan we did a whole video on the master
plan the link to it up here and down
below if you want to watch it but the
moral was this Tesla wants to speed up
the development of sustainable
transportation and that's really been
their goal that's why a lot of their
patents they open sourced all the
manufactures can use them and start
creating electric vehicles was trying to
see that really now come to life I'm
pretty excited about the model 3 I'm
reservation holder I can't wait to drive
it to try it I don't know how to feel
about to look yet a little snub nose is
not my favorite but perhaps they'll
change by time we finally speeds a
relief candidate what do you guys think
which car you most excited about is the
threes the why excited test was bringing
sexy back for me I'm excited up to three
but let's keep the wild looks like the
semi is more of like a curiosity thing
for me but leave in the comments down
below if you watching more Tesla
coverage video thumbs up to let us know
we got a ton of Tesla videos sort of a
passion of mine so it's left to talk
about it so next time Jon Ranger from
TechnoBuffalo</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
