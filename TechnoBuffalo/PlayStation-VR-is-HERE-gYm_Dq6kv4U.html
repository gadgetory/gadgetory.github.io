strapping cardboard to your face and
while the Google cardboard still has a
place especially the inexpensive realm
PlayStation I think has the answers I
hope for consumer virtual reality meet
the PlayStation VR this is the launch
bundle and I am damn excited as you see
being pod named Morpheus we saw it a few
years ago at CES but has taken the green
pill or the red pill and is now a
reality it's called open this thing up
we'll set it up and give some first
impressions so this launch bundle is
going to set you back $4.99 but if you
want to get just the core of it you can
shave off 100 bucks and gonna cost you
399 so inside we got one box you got
another box we don't if you don't need
we don't need this box you can see
what's inside you got the headset the
controllers in game alright let's go
look at the big guy first and see what
we got
PlayStation logo and tell exponent rip
this upper sucker open and get virtual
reality
well that's fancy good for you Sony
PlayStation VR booklet lots of cabling
and stuff here we've got the power cord
and power brick other power things power
brick just wanna see the headset come to
me so I am one of the few that did not
test out project Morpheus or any test at
all when this thing was in beta my first
impression strapping this thing in my
head plugging it in and trying it so
inside the box you also have connection
cables
you've got the cable it's gonna connect
this to your PlayStation so you've got
inline controls on the headset as well
and all your connection cables will go
through what all this is we do the setup
process guys will see that in just a few
minutes and more HDMI cables live inside
box number one inside of box number
- we have probably imagine all the games
and the controllers because to use psvr
you need a lot of things you need a
Playstation 4 a PlayStation camera
PlayStation controller and a PS Move
controller so we've got PlayStation VR
demo disc PlayStation VR world's got a
scan for the camera the ice cream cone
or the moon whatever you want to call it
got two of them
cables cleaning cloths and the
PlayStation camera that's it enough
enough talking about this I want to put
this thing on my head get it set up see
how it works
the Pagani so first impression it works
pretty well the graphics leasing these
demo games don't look like incredible
ps4 graphics but looks like decent you
know VR graphics I don't imagine job
simulator is representative of
everything pets simply coming out the
motion tracking is pretty good like I
definitely can tell that I'm moving my
hand there when I was driving the car as
I moved my hand I was able to see things
pretty well overall pretty press which
we consider it's a couple hundred bucks
less and what you get with oculus or
vive and you can prevent to plug it into
your ps4 and don't need an external you
know be sleepy see once you get to be a
little more mature I think the games are
gonna be really gonna tell how well this
thing does if you're looking to get into
VR you don't want to shell out for an
oculus or a vibe I don't want to build a
computer that'll sort of match those
specs this is a really good way to get
into beyond think it's a really
compelling reason to pick up a ps4 one
of them many now ps4 SKUs works well I
think it's be pretty cool to watch
movies with you get a really immersive
view and a stereoscopic 3d and it tends
to work pretty well I'm impressed I've
never been a giant fan of virtual
reality but this work truly well you're
when I'm looking right now and I can see
shadows coming over my hand hey what do
you guys think about the psvr did you
pick one up is it is it for you is it
not for you let me know why the video a
thumbs up till next time I'm Jenna
endure for TechnoBuffalo and I will know
where you are but somewhere I will see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
