if there's a stance on something through
obviously exploring the the second
question would be so nice and Stein know
that you don't know Sara Lee oversee the
gaming division but at least there's
some overlap if you have any sort of
statement on Sony stance on the
tinkering and the hacking community as
well I know there's been a decent amount
of news being made about that those are
the two questions that we saw more than
more than anything else actually as you
mentioned the playstation business
related components of their business is
not under my roommate so i defer that
question to my colleagues over in place
now sure if we talk about the
first point through the tablet market
that's a very interesting topic at CES
we announced that we are pursuing a
tablet range that we will bring to
market at the same time you know the
the CES there was event over a hundred i
think announcement made that various
manufacturers coming to market of
tablets we know for sure to stand out
from the crowd and we must stand out
that we have to have deliberate
differentiated entertainment experience
to the consumers and we're very focused
on them
for today that's all I'll say you have
to be a little bit longer for
information ok you can he use some idea
timing for tablet that's not at this
stage so we will be following up in due
course but today that's what I could
diagnose take it cool park will park
into mobile com so going on the the
Kappa discussion is that so as far as
tableau strategy is concerned is that
going to fall under the Sony umbrella or
with that cross over into the sony
ericsson umbrella given you know mobile
operating systems and all that so as i
mentioned there's more information to
cover little bit legs so for all the
time that I can't explain at this time
okay
when Sony Ericsson's recent proclamation
that they want to be number one in
Android and what you just said about you
know the Google TV platform seems like
Sony's kind of pinning a decent amount
of its near-term future on Google on
google and I'm wondering you know if you
have any comment on that if that gives
you any pause if you think that it's
important for Sony to continue
developing its own software outside of
the PlayStation space or if moving
towards things like you know more and
more open source platforms it's kind of
the future describe your personal yeah
I'm sorry yeah I know I know I know I
the first question was just you know 3d
in the home our glasses the big obstacle
and so when we look at the 3d technology
absolute CES we demonstrated glasses
less free 3d
TV panel and where that technology is
today is it's in a demonstration mode
but commercialization of glasses
l'esprit 3d is a long way that's from an
economic point
we could probably take something to
market in the next few years but whether
it's commercially viable or affordable
for the consumer is a question while
we've got some work to do so as the
industry
I think the consumers today really want
to enjoy the entertaining experience
that they can have experience with 3d
today they don't want to wait and we're
seeing that in terms of the number of TV
sets with Sally and the reason we bring
personal products where you can generate
personal 3d content the reason we bring
them to market because they're there is
that demands you but I think that's
where we are with glasses glasses is
free tvs on other platforms and
engagement and collaboration around the
Android platform I think this is a
movement around the globe for many
manufacturers is bringing consumer
benefits we're leveraging that where
it's
where we see it fits to the consumers
needs and that will continue to be our
focus but on the other side we have
quite enormous experience and expertise
in software development we also take a
look at the in-house capability as well
as other software platforms that may
arrive in the future so it's all about
an open world we want to deliver the
best experience to our consumers and
allow them to access content anyplace
anytime anywhere great fill our</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
