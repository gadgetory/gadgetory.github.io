TechnoBuffalo here Verizon fans the day
you've waited for is finally upon us I
have in my hot little hand the HTC One
for Big Red's go ahead and unbox it and
see if anything is different
the version we already know and love
here we've got the HTC One box it's
different than the HTC One box we've
seen in the past this one is sort of
more Square and rectangular and angular
and all kinds of other stuff unless
squat and then the other ones so nothing
else that exciting on it go ahead and
open this up and there is the HTC One
this was probably my favorite phone of
the past year and I'm really excited
that it made its way to Verizon we'll
take a quick look at it here there is
the HTC One with its 4.7 inch 1920 by
1080 pixel display screen which is a PPI
of 469 and that is how you know it's for
Verizon big giant verizon writing has
there been prone to do recently other
than that though this is everything
stock about the HTC One let's see what
else we're going to have in the box
you've got your sim removal tool go and
pull it off it is a micro sim we've got
some booklets in there getting to know
your phone warranty information than
your little SIM card we've got some
pretty nice headphones here and I get
some flak sometimes found opening these
headphones up so I will show you what
they look like these are not beats they
do have sort of the red ear tips on them
pretty decent headphones action I do
like the flat cord makes kinking a
little bit harder so those are in there
and then we've got just a wall wart and
a standard microUSB charging and syncing
cable let's go and power this guy on and
I'll run you through the specs if you
want to see our full review of the HTC
One I'll annotate it here and there'll
be a link down below on it as well it's
still surprising how quickly these films
usually boot up we'll see if it's got
quick boot enabled here on this HTC One
so again 4.7 inch 1080p screen it's
running supposedly Android 4.2 some
variant we'll take a look at that once
the phone boots up it's got a 1.7
gigahertz Snapdragon 600 chip which is
of course quad-core being augmented with
2 gigs of RAM available in 32 or 64 I
believe the folks at Verizon
send us the 32 gig version unfortunately
though no room for expandable storage no
removable battery here the battery
though is a pretty beastly 2,300
milliamp hour battery and actually
battery life for me has been pretty good
with the HTC One I will see how it is
though with Verizon's Network there's
been a lot of talk about this camera on
the back it is an ultra pixel camera
which does a pretty nice job of taking
pictures it's a four ultra pixel camera
we've done full camera comparisons
comparing with other reflective devices
that will also be linked down below so
you can see samples around that camera
works also takes 1080p video then
there's a more standard 2 megapixel
shooter living right there
on the front a Bluetooth 4.0 and NFC are
onboard here as well let's take a quick
look at the phone and see what we've got
we've got blinkfeed just sort of like a
Flipboard Eska way of getting all your
information right on your home screen if
we go into apps one of the things about
the one is you can configure how many
icons you can see on a grid so go ahead
make that four by five so I can see much
more all over eyes and apps look to be
in a folder so you can choose to not
view that if you'd like I'll NFL mobile
is actually pretty neat we've got
Verizon's voicemail on there of course
you can download your own visual
voicemail application and that is really
it not that much bloatware whatever blue
wear is though lives in just that one
single folder so that is kind of nice
but jump into settings and see it we've
got about the storm see what kind of
software we are running out of the box
software information we've got Android
4.2.2 so not quite 4.3 yet we've seen
that filter out to the International
variants or presumably it'll come to the
carrier versions very soon and since 5 I
really like give sense 5 shot if you're
not a big fan of skins this is probably
the most usable one I've seen so if
you're picking up the HTC One for the
first time be wary that HTC logo is not
a button as much as you want it to be
you've got a back button home button
everything else is done via on-screen
bottom we've got boom sound speakers who
did a full demonstration in our review
of those but it sounds incredible the
best phone speakers I have ever tried
absolutely awesome so you need the phone
for the playing music or have loud
speakerphone it's a great way to go
everything else through those everything
we know and love about the HTC One but
now available with Verizon 4G
