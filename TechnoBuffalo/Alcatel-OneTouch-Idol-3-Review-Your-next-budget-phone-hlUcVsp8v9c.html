smaller is there really any room for an
above average budget entry I'm mark
percent over TechnoBuffalo and these are
the Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3 the idol 3
comes in two models one with a 4.7 inch
display with a really kind of tiny form
factor and a 5.5 inch model the build
quality is the same but the specs are
different and that's everything from the
screen to the innards so let's talk
about this 4.7 inch model really quickly
it's a 4.7 inch IPS LCD display 720 by
1280 that comes to a PPI of 312 which is
pretty low just running a snapdragon 410
with an Adreno 306 and it's rockin 1.5
gigs of ram this bigger handset has got
a 5.5 inch IPS LCD display the 1920 by
1080 resolution for a ppi of 401 a
Snapdragon 615 Adreno 405 and you've got
2 gigs of ram in this model both of
these two contains 16 gigs of on-board
storage and an SD slot which is
expandable up to 128 gigs the build on
both of these things is actually really
good most of its plastic but the metal
trim here gives it kind of like a semi
premium feel if the specs on this device
we're a little bit more robust I'd still
be super super happy with the build
quality of both of them really I think
the best way to describe them is svelte
I just I think that word kind of
embodies how they feel in the hand they
feel slim strong comfortable the design
isn't like super groundbreaking or
anything like that but it feels nice in
the hand it's kind of an offensive the
only thing that I don't like at all in
terms of the hardware is the placement
of that home button that home button is
just a little too high up on that left
side but this is mitigated by tap to
wake in another feature that we will
cover very shortly
the displays on these devices are good
for what they are but the display on the
5.5 inch model is much much better than
the 4.7 inch entry the color on the 4.7
inch models display is washed out the
contrast is murky a fast and the screen
is sharp enough for the size but it's
nothing to write home about the viewing
angles on both however are very good
five point five inch has a much more
pleasant display and got a much higher
pixel density than the four point seven
inch model the color temperature is a
contrast all much better on the five
point five inch display unfortunately
though both of these displays have they
must have similar touch panels because
they're not the most responsive and you
are gonna notice it at times as you're
scrolling around you're gonna see just
or a tap here and there might not quite
trigger on both of these devices so the
touch panel left a little something to
be desired but nothing too too bad the
performance on both devices was totally
passable but really nothing to write
home about
I did notice some non-trivial amounts of
lag on both devices I turned on GPU
rendering and it's really really clear
that they both have a bit of a hard time
and again that responsiveness of the
touch panel with that in question
combined with the lag I can't really say
that the idle offered a terribly
pleasant experience when it comes to
performance though it certainly wasn't
the worst it could handle the basics
just don't really expect to - much more
than that just loading up Adventure Time
puzzle quest on this thing was a three
minute affair and that's on the higher
end model if you notice I don't usually
talk too much about the speakers on
devices unless they're above average
most phones just have okay speakers it's
nothing crazy and I just need more time
and videos but these are above average
while they're not boom sound they
definitely sound better than they have
any right to their front facing they're
pretty crisp and they get pretty loud
the camera on both of these devices is
fine the 4.7 inch definitely struggles a
little bit more than the 5.5 inch model
things are a little bit more washed out
things are a little bit murkier and
definitely has a little bit of issue
with noise and neither device does
terribly well in low light but in decent
light to good light the 5.5 inch device
has a great camera better than you would
expect a camera like this to be it's
even got an HDR mode and it takes some
decent shots better than I expected them
to be so I was pleasantly surprised by
the camera in the 5.5 inch
the battery life on both of these was a
little weird at first it was working out
pretty okay the small one especially
since it's a low resolution display it's
really not rocking too much in there
doesn't eat up battery too quickly but
then when I started using them a little
bit more frequently throughout the day
they had a hard time making it through
overnights in standby mode after a full
day of usage plus neither of these
support fast charging so they are gonna
need a little bit of TLC when it comes
to battery which unfortunately I mean
that's I would really expect more than
that from a budget device that should be
one of the things that you do really
well as a bunch of device and these are
okay the software actually had a ton of
pleasant little tweaks nothing here is
terribly offensive the launcher is
skinned but it's fine and a handful of
apps that are pre-loaded aren't terribly
obtrusive they're easy enough to
disregard so that's really not that big
of a deal we're all can tell really kind
of stepped up is a few touches that make
it clear that they're they are making an
effort to differentiate wherever
possible despite how silly it might seem
one of the marquee features of the idles
is the fully reversible nature of the
screens on these devices
sure this is just screen orientation and
we've seen it on a bunch of stuff before
but until now we've really kind of only
seen it on a tablet think about it how
often do you pick up your phone when
it's turned off and realize that you
need to flip it upside down in order to
use it happens to me all the time but
with these it doesn't matter it's kind
of nice you can just pick it up double
tap to wake it and then go about using
it this one time I actually didn't even
realize that it was upside-down until I
went to lock it to put it down and it's
a small thing but it really made a big
difference and I do wish that were
standard in every Android build while I
did have time overall positive
experience with these devices I'm just
struggling to figure out exactly where
they fit if you're in the market for a
cheap phone you could certainly do a lot
worse than the 4.7 inch idol 3 it's tiny
the battery life is fine the camera
spine and the software is inoffensive if
someone came up to me and told me that
they need a phone for less than 200
bucks this is where I'd point them but
then I'd remember that the Moto G is the
same price at 180 and it arguably offers
you more bang for your buck then we get
to the 5.5 inch model at 270 bucks I
wonder
your money isn't better spent picking up
a zenfone 2 at 300 bucks I think the
amount of compromises that you're gonna
be making in terms of performance at
that price point it's just a little bit
too much to justify making this
particular purchase especially when you
take into account the estate of Lux that
the market is in right now bottom line
is while these are decent devices for
the price point they don't really do
anything big enough to merit my
attention with other more serious
contenders in the same price range let
me know what you guys think about the
