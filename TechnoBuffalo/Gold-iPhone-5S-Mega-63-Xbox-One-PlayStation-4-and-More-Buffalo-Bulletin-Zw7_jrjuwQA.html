major stories from our site
TechnoBuffalo calm a couple of times a
week if you're interested in reading

Evan here your top stories samsung
announced yesterday morning they would
be bringing the gigantic galaxy s mega
6.3 to the US via AT&amp;amp;T Sprint and US
cellular carriers we're still not a
hundred percent sure about that 720p
screen on such a large phone but we did
enjoy the device while it was here in
the office and we're sure there are
plenty of folks out there looking for a
giant handset that would be thrilled to
use the mega 6.3 pricing and release
states weren't immediately available for
sprint or US cellular but we're sure
they'll be in the same general ranges
AT&amp;amp;T which is releasing the phone later
this month for $149 on contract bling
lovers rejoice looks like Apple may be
planning a gold iPhone 5s if some new
reports that surfaced over the weekend
are to be believed several other sources
have confirmed this champagne gold
iPhone 5s it's possible this edition may
be a bid by Apple to sway wealthy
Chinese consumers towards the new iPhone
but overall I think this kind of stuff
doesn't really matter since ninety
percent of phone buyers just slap or
grotesquely tacky case they found at a
mall kiosk on their phone after they buy
it gamescom kicked off in Germany
yesterday and there is a slew of new
information about both new consoles
Microsoft kicked things off with their
press conference announcing over 20
launch day titles including some huge
exclusives like rise son of Rome Forza 5
killer instinct Crimson Dragon and more
no specific launch date yet for the
console itself but it's a pretty solid
list for anybody who has ordered a day
one
x 1 sony have their big gamescom press
event earlier today dropping their
launch date idol list along with a
couple of extra surprises console
exclusives include guns of Icarus online
hotline Miami 2 and everybody's gone to
the rapture they also dropped the price
of the veto to 199 and gave us a launch
date the PlayStation 4 will officially

America and November 29th in Europe

best console when our grab bag story
this week is the final piece of content
created by our interns David and Braden
before they had to go home and back to
school if you've ever needed to unroot
your android phone and bring it in for
service they put together a handy little
video guide for anybody who wants to go
back to stock firmware of course rooting
your phone and unrooting it is at your
own risk but if you love Android you've
probably at the very least thought about
rooting so it's worth a look that's the
