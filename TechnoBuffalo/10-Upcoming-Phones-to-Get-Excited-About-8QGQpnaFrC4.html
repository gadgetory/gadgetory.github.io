Sangin from technobuffalo and 2015 is
already proving to be a great year for
smartphones but the year isn't over yet
and there's still a lot to look forward
to following the release of phones like
the galaxy s6 LG g4 HTC One m9 into 1
plus 2 we're going to get even better
devices in the next few months here are
some smart phones we're looking most
forward to while none of these phones
have been confirmed there have been
plenty of rumors surrounding their
imminent arrival is giving us a pretty
good idea of what to expect so the first
one on our list is the city man and talk
man Windows 10 devices now part of the
reason we're really excited about
Microsoft's upcoming devices is that
they will be among the first handsets to
run full Windows 10 Microsoft wanted to
do something different with its latest
operating system by running 10 s across
phones tablets and PCs with a unified OS
continuity between mobile and desktop
should be much better as such we should
expect some flagship specs from these
two devices the talk man should pack a
5.2 inch qhd oled display a snapdragon
808 processor an iris infrared scanner
for windows hello 3 gigabytes of ram 32
gigabytes of expandable storage a 20
megapixel PureView camera a 5-megapixel
wide-angle front facing camera qi
wireless charging a 3,000 milliamp
battery and USB type-c City man on the
other hand should pack beefier specs
like a bigger 5.7 inch qhd OLED display
a Snapdragon 810 processor 3 gigabytes
of ram 32 gigabytes of expandable
storage and iris infrared scanner for
windows hello a 20 megapixel camera with
triple LED flash aluminum side buttons a
bigger three thousand three hundred
million battery and will also feature Qi
wireless charging and USB type-c these
windows 10 mobile devices sound like
great options if you're into Microsoft's
ecosystem they'll be packing some
serious hardware though we're still
unsure when these devices will pop up
hopefully we'll see an official
announcement at IFA in September so the
second one on our list is the galaxy
note 5 and galaxy s6 edge+ samson's note
line has gone better over the years and
we should expect this trend to keep up
once the new iteration hits the Galaxy
Note 4 was an awesome device it gave us
a taste of the companies emphasis on
improved designs and the overall build
quality was just superb with a galaxy
note 5 however we should expect to see
the same design language we saw from the
galaxy s
six and s6 edge complete with a metal
frame and glass body not only will the
note 5 look more luxurious than ever it
should also feel much better to hold the
device early picture suggests the back
side will have curved edges making it
more ergonomic for the hand in terms of
specs here's what we know so far the
galaxy note 5 will feature the XE no
7422 processor 4 gigabytes of RAM a five
point six seven inch Super AMOLED qhd
display a microSD slot for expandable
storage and an updated s-pen the galaxy
s6 edge+ on the other hand might
actually steal the show and offer a
similar screen as you note 5 along with
similar specs however the design will
differ in that more closely matched
Samsung's Galaxy s6 edge which remains
one of the cooler and more unique phones
on a market rumor has it Samsung plants
and veiled both phones in mid-august
ahead of an official release later that
month the third one on our list is
Sony's Xperia z5 Sony smartphone lineup
is a bit messy right now in the past few
months we've seen the company in veiled
Xperia z4 then 2 Z 3 plus and finally
the Xperia z4 V however it looks like
Sony may have a fix on the way in the
form of an Xperia z5 its next flagship
device the Xperia z5 should launch later
this year with some serious hardware
though it could be limited to Japan at
first the z5 will apparently pack a
Snapdragon 820 processor which seems a
bit of an overkill right now but if it's
for future proofing then why not it
should also pack 4 gigabytes of RAM a
massive 4500 milliamp battery and a
fingerprint scanner otherwise it should
offer similar industrial design to the
Xperia z4 which looks great as for the
camera Sony's allegedly sticking with a
20 point seven megapixel shooter though
the phone will get an updated c MOS
sensor which should mean improved photos
and video the Xperia z5 won't launch for
at least a few more months though
hopefully it hits the market sooner
rather than later the fourth one on our
list is the iphone 6s and 6s plus now
when Apple unveiled iPhone 6 and 6 plus
last year the company finally took the
step toward bigger screens and chances
are we'll see the same thing repeated
this year with a new iPhone set to
launch in a few months Apple is rumored
to equip the new iphones with a 12
megapixel sensor to better compete
against its Android counterparts
hopefully we'll see 4k video recording
better slow mo and better low-light
capabilities rumors are also saying that
the new iPhones will feature Apple's new
for such technology which would enable
the device to tell the difference
between a quick tap and a strong
a touch to display and react accordingly
we've seen this technology before on the
Apple watch and the latest macbook so it
would make sense for Apple to add this
feature to its next generation iphones
we should also expect the iphone 6s and
6s plus the feature Apple's latest a 9
processor 2 gigabytes of RAM a new NFC
chip faster LTE stronger bills and even
a new rose gold color option we're not
too far away from Apple's usual
September events so hopefully we'll
learn more about the iphone 6s and 6s
plus soon the fifth one in our list is
the new Nexus now there's been a lot of
rumors going around with various leaks
trying to paint a picture of what to
expect though Google is rumored to
launch two new nexus smartphones this
year one made from LG and the other one
from Huawei the new LG Nexus smartphone
is expected to support a 5.2 inch qhd
display qualcomm snapdragon 808
processor and a 27 hundred million
battery it may also feature a 3d camera
similar to what we've seen with Google's
Project tango and feature a totally new
design rather than rehashing a current
LG phone the Huawei Nexus device on the
other hand sounds pretty impressive
inside it's apparently packing a
Snapdragon 820 processor a fingerprint
scanner a 3500 million battery and a 5.7
inch qhd display which seems like a more
manageable size compared to this year's
Nexus 6 Google isn't expected to reveal
any new Nexus gadgets until late 2015
when it releases the final build of
Android M Google's event typically
happens near the end of October so we've
still got a few more months before the
rumoured phones get an official
unveiling so the last one on our list is
the android blackberry phone now last
month there were reports suggesting that
blackberry might load one of its new
phones with android well within a few
weeks of those reports surfacing another
report claimed that the mysterious
blackberry slider would eventually wind
up on AT&amp;amp;T the blackberry Venice will
apparently be a high-end blackberry
handset that will be better than any of
the BlackBerry 10 devices we've seen so
far inside it will allegedly pack a 5.4
inch qhd display a 1.8 giga hertz
snapdragon 808 processor and 3-year
bytes of ram the Venice is also expected
to have an 18 megapixel camera and a 5
megapixel camera in front rumors have it
that the blackberry Venice will hit
sometime in November so we're only a few
more months away until we hear an
official announcement from blackberry
now we've already seen some big
phones this year but it looks like we
ain't seen nothing yet judging by the
phone still on a horizon it looks like
many of today's top companies 12 n 2015
with a bang let us know what smartphone
