to you by lynda.com what's up everyone
john wrench from TechnoBuffalo here i
want to give my first impressions of
this guy the latest to come out of
amazon's labs this is the fire phone is
it worth it is it not worth it should
you pick one up pre-order or whatever it
might be
stick around I'll tell you my first
impressions of the latest from Amazon so
let me start with a disclaimer this is
not our full review I've had the device
since last Friday so by the time this is
being filmed I've had it for about five
days you know the way we do reviews
you always disclose how long we use them
and I don't feel that five days was
enough time to get to know a new phone
especially a new phone with an all new
OS and all kinds of strange things
happening to make the phone very unique
I want to give it the full time to know
all the nuances so expect a review in
about a week or so another disclaimer
the device receives a software update
earlier today is being filmed on Tuesday
it's a three point five point one so a
few changes are in there as well so I
really like fire OS on a tablet I love
the Kindle Fire HDX devices they work
absolutely awesome I think they're well
designed well engineered and the OS is
really intuitive on a tablet I mostly
just use the browser in a few apps it's
pretty simple stuff on a phone though
that the same OS with some tweaks can
become really really confusing and I was
looking at this phone not realizing how
to do stuff and that comes from a guy
who reviews phones for a living over the
past five years I've checked out
probably every single major US release
phone that's come out now don't confuse
confusing with not capable the OS is
very capable but the learning curve here
is very steep it's not like Android you
pick up a device you know where things
are going to be together so what skin is
on or iOS you know where things are this
is the entirely new experience so be
prepared for that from day one so the
panel on the left is gonna be your main
sort of shopping pants we're gonna
access your apps all your books really
anything that amazon has to offer that's
what this phone is really all about
getting you to Amazon so it's there it's
gonna get you to shortcuts to where you
want to go but the main OS it's really
used to the carousel it's gonna show you
all your apps from your verse
chronological order use the information
below them you can click on
unfortunately you don't know what
information is going to
show and you can't really control what
information is going to be there they're
sort of at the mercy of the OS to figure
it's going to show you the shortcuts
that you want for example if you click
on settings you're gonna get a few
settings gonna show up down below you
have to actually go into the Settings
app to access the rest of the settings
which you could sort of customize it's
going to show below in the carousel the
big thing here to fire from the dynamic
perspective the first thing I test took
out of the box it's got five cameras
that are staring at you one in each
corners can be used for dynamic
perspective what that's gonna do it's
gonna see you ahead it's gonna track
where you're moving and where your head
is in relation to the device it's gonna
sort of move things around
if 3d for example sort of brought things
out from the phone dammit perspective
sort of brings you inside of the device
think of it as putting your face inside
of a picture frame and looking around at
the image that's really what you get
with the fire phone you can see around
icons you can see sort of behind the
text it's a really cool way to show
things it was really awesome
in gaming I thought it added a whole new
dimension to gaming anywhere else though
it kind of became a bit cumbersome to
use I was interesting in maps and I very
quickly tried to find a way to turn it
off what you cannot do but the positive
thing is that Amazon is opening up the
eph list so this could be an incredibly
useful feature in the near future but
right now I just did so much of a manage
there quite yet you take a quick break

buffalo that's ly NDA comm such act no
buffalo we're gonna do more testing on
the camera but our first impressions it
seems pretty solid but a little bit slow
to take the picture but it was awesome
in low light the sign on the phone is
looks like any other film looks nowadays
it's got glass on the back glass on the
front and it's got a bit of a plastic
molding around the side and a gigantic
Amazon logo Firefly is also the main big
feature essentially what it's gonna do
it's gonna sort of recognize anything
you put in front of the camera more than
that so it'll do music and start a
playlist for you based on that song can
look at books all kinds of other stuff
it works as advertised gets you a way to
sort of buy stuff from Amazon
exactly what it's supposed to do these
are just first impressions of the fire
phone if I was gonna do a full review
after five days on a brand new OS
that beyond that got a software update
earlier in the day it wouldn't be fair
to the device so I'm gonna keep using it
I'm gonna test it see if I can figure
out more nuances what works what doesn't
work and more shortcuts usually waste
multitasking things like that but I
think particularly you guys want to see
leaving the comments down below just let
the review in about a week or so and I
feel more comfortable using it getting
