TechnoBuffalo here at the for you for
you of the Samsung Captivate AT&amp;amp;T Galaxy
S variant so before we start talking
about the features and specs and how the
whole package of the phone comes
together let's talk about call volume at
ur how good a phone is if the call
quality stinks it's not going to be
useful so I'm happy to report that much
like most phones I've tested recently
call coy and the captivate has been very
very very good
I had no popping no white noise on my
end of an atomic callers other ends I
had no white noise are popping there
either
very minimal drop calls I used as my
daily driver for almost two weeks and a
2 week total had only two dropped calls
so the thing has been very very very
solid at call quality you can great
speaker volume is very loud so if you
need to use at the phone and phone
quality is your top concern no need to
worry the captivate is going to serve
you very well so let's go ahead and talk
about sort how all the features come
together it sort of a quick refresh the
captivate is using something called a
Super AMOLED screen so the short
definition of what that means is on
traditional capacitive touch screens the
touch layer of glass is actually right
on top of the glass on a Super AMOLED
device the touch sensitive mechanisms
actually built into the glass which is
going to mean that you're gonna get
brighter colors you're going to get
better visibility in sunlight and you're
going to get what's most considered to
be a more vibrant display and that is
quite true here with the captivate it's
got a resolution of 480 by 800 on a
killer resolution but on the screen that
resolution does look fantastic I did a
comparison with the Super AMOLED versus
the iPhone for dreaded his fly and it
really came up to a titer when you're
going to prefer I'll put links to those
down below something to note there is a
bit of a hue almost a bluish hue on the
screen of the captivate and that's going
to give you a bit more visibility in
direct sunlight but it's something to
keep in mind the screen doesn't look
crystal clear and the whites on this
Ernie look white it looked a little bit
more gray however if you can deal with
that are you doing to use your phone
again in direct sunlight and have a very
very beautiful vibrant display pictures
of gorgeous and video indeed
looks gorgeous as well so go ahead and
jump back here generally I've not been
the biggest fan of capacitive buttons
and the captivate does feature for
capacitive buttons across the bottom
although Samsung has done a very good
job of making them work on devices like
the nexus 1 for example the capacitive
buttons drove me crazy but here they
work quite well no need to worry from a
software standpoint
Samsung has skinned Android 2.1 with
their new TouchWiz interface which is
much less intrusive than previous touch
with interfaces that we've seen you've
got some Samsung dedicated widgets you
got through that four icons across the
bottom dock which makes things very easy
there are a decent amount of Samsung
widgets as well which do make things
quite nice they're got a calendar
buddies nowadays dual clock feeds and
updates and Yahoo Finance
Samsung didn't go too far with skinny
Android I think Android you needed
something to go too far skinning it
Android on its own is a very robust
nice-looking offerings with them
the Samsung just sort of added
additional capabilities there certainly
kudos to them for that so it's going
back to the screen it is a 4-inch screen
of course capacitive battery life it's a
1500 milliamp hour battery this is one
section where I wasn't overly thrilled
with the captivate they advertised top
time about five point eight hours of 3G
time at 340 hours at standby time I
would say that using this as my daily
phone so I'm on maybe two or three hours
of talktime a heavy Internet usage and
sort of cons of email checking the phone
was down to almost dead from being
turned on about 7:00 a.m. it was I'm
dead almost around 10:00 so you're gonna
have to manage your battery life with a
device like the captivate from a static
standpoint I think it looks fantastic
it's very thin this late form factor
something I'm a huge fan of it really
just feels good in the hands and the
four inch screen size may actually be
the perfect sort of compromise between
the mammoth 4.3 inch screen on the Evo
4G and the Droid X and maybe the smaller
3.5 inch screen found on the iPhone 4 4
it just feels right without making a
huge additional bulge in your pocket
when you're walking around enough
they're always gonna be worried about
breaking it or getting weird stairs by
holding a mammoth phone up to your head
so I think four inches probably is going
to be the perfect standpoint the camera
on the back is 5 megapixels and it does
take pretty good pictures I do wish
there was an LED flash most phones now
have at least one LED flash some even
have - this does not a can record video
though at 720p so that I believe is
going to be 1280 by 720 the video
recording autumn is actually very very
good one of the concerns I have that the
captivate is the build quality how it's
going to hold up over time this back
part is metal this is plastic and take
the back off this part actually slides
out have a concern that this parts going
to come loose I've had some issues with
samsung build quality in the past so I'm
a little bit dubious however I haven't
had any reason for concern on the
captivate it's more just based on the
Samsung build quality from previous
devices something to keep in mind and
again there's a little speaker grille so
overall I've really been very happy with
the with the phone and how it works how
it functions it's just been a fantastic
device I've reviewed a ton of Android
phones recently as you guys are well
aware and this one is probably one of
the best and I can definitely say that
the hummingbird process are found in
here which shares almost exactly same
architectures apples a4 make the
captivate an absolute screamer
this phone is blistering fast and hangs
down the fastest phone I have ever
tested after the iPhone 4 faster than
any Snapdragon phone I've tested this
thing is fast if speed is what you need
the captivate or galaxy s device is
definitely going to be the way to go
this thing handles everything I threw at
it I didn't have to go through and
closed applications I could leave
everything open and just work it's got
the RAM it's got the wrong and in turn
they has a processor to sort of back of
that up so TouchWiz is a bit processor
intensive but it hasn't slowed anything
down this is one of this one really have
to go sort of see to realise how quick
and fast it is so I'm about to rank this
on a scale from one to five I give it a
very very very solid by ranking and a
four point seven five and five stars
only for build quality concern
and the lack of an LED flash and perhaps
a higher megapixel camera would have
been nice oh this is about as close to a
perfect Android phone as I think you're
going to find so if you're sort of up in
the air and wondering what phone you
should get and you're looking towards
Android you're going to be hard-pressed
to find something better and it's thin
and a thin form factor like the
captivate I really highly recommend it
and this may be a phone that I like to
use sort of in place of my iPhone as my
daily driver it's it's fantastic it
works well you get access to all the
Android Marketplace and overall it's
just been a really pleasant experience
