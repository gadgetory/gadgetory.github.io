here unboxing the Samsung Galaxy gear
it's the SmartWatch everyone's been
talking about this fall I stay tuned
after the jump and let's get this thing
opened up alright so here is the box
this is what it comes in it's almost a
cube but not quite and of course the
same wood grain a sort of box packaging
that we have seen for all of the Galaxy
devices recently but let's open her up
and see what's inside there it is the
beautiful Galaxy gear so here is the
watch itself a SmartWatch for the ages
2013 this is the this was the big deal
this is the big SmartWatch for 2013 I'm
gonna put this right here and we'll see
what else is inside of the box
alright so it looks like of course we
have our charging cable and actually
this one's connected it's not a USB so
this is just by itself charging cable
and then we also have some manuals some
warnings all those things some different
stuff and then this is your charging
dock so you'll plug this right into here
and then you actually just dock your
watch right in there and you're able to
to use it if we take it out we can see
that a little bit better so what you do
is there's a little switch right here
you pop that open you open it up and
this is how your watch goes in so here
are the the pins here I'm gonna take the
lovely plastic off this so you guys can
get that noise that you so love but you
would put your watch right in here like
this and then close the door and then
plug this in so that's how that works
if you weren't curious about how to
charge your Galaxy gear SmartWatch but
that's it that's it inside the box
there's nothing else alright let's check
out the Galaxy gear itself this is a
really interesting little device I got
to see it at Aoife it's got an 800
megahertz processor onboard it's a
single core and it also has 512
megabytes of RAM let's take this film
off oh not as satisfying as I was hoping
but still
pretty good so yeah it has 512 Meg's of
RAM it is running a 1.9 megapixel BSI
sensor here on the camera and it does
autofocus and it records sound as well
so if you're wondering about that yes it
does I love how you actually are able to
resize this so I have really tiny wrists
and that's always a thing that keeps me
from buying watches one of the things
that I really liked about this when I
saw it at Aoife was that you are really
easily able to resize it there's a notch
underneath pull this out maybe push it
down you match it up with a smaller
notch then you can wear your watch so if
I were to wear it on this wrist just
like that and there you go see and it
fits which is great and so if you're one
of those people who if you wear watches
you don't want them jingling around on
your wrist like me you can definitely
fit this and this is still even a couple
of not just shy of totally small so if
you even if you have a smaller wrist
than I do you can go even one more and
two more notches up so certainly sizable
for just about everybody which is
fantastic now the screen is a 1.6 3 inch
super amoled it's 320 by 320 it is we
haven't tested it out in the Sun yet and
I've been really curious about that ever
since IFA Super AMOLED had it has a
tendency to be a little bit faded in the
Sun a little bit difficult to see in
full sunlight so I'll be very curious to
see how this performs outside in broad
daylight
let's see if the batteries charged a
little bit and there is our splash
screen samsung galaxy gear of course if
you are curious about the battery in
this it's a 315 million power battery so
should last you about a day that's what
they told us at IFA I'm sure over time
they'll do some battery optimizations
the build quality is really really nice
and well it looks like it wants to sink
so you have to tap your phone against
this and all this good stuff so I'm
gonna leave that to the next video for
our hands on
