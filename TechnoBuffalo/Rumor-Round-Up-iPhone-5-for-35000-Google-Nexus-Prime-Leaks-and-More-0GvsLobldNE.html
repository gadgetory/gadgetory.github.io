brought to you by carbonite welcome to
rumor roundup i'm jon rettinger filling
in for Noah kravitz who's left this
planet for the week we've got a lot to
talk about in the rumor roundup pasture
we're going to talk about not one but
two brand new iPhones and two new iPhone
carriers we're going to talk about the
blackberry torch 2 and the new
blackberry bolds what's coming next from
google and what their next nexus phone
is going to be and that pretty three
when are we finally going to see it this
is techno buffalos rumor roundup
so we are one hundred percent mobile in
this particular episode of rumor roundup
it is all cell phones all the time at
least for the next few minutes let's
start with big daddy of cell phones the
iphone coming out rumors this week that
we're not going to see one new iphone
which you're all knew was coming
eventually but two new iPhones the
interesting rumor is that the lower-cost
iPhone the second one will be three
hundred and fifty dollars available
completely off contract and may actually
just end up being an iphone 3gs it's a
great way for apples n turn to compete
with some of the lower end android
devices that are sort of flooding the
market so if you need to get a new phone
you don't want to sign a two-year
contract you can go ahead and walk into
your Apple Store strut on in hello apple
store and pick yourself up a brand-new
iphone 4 350 bucks and not have to sign
one of them soul-sucking two or
three-year contracts depending on what
country you are in the other iphone
rumor is of course the iphone 5 which
we're still hearing is on pace for a sep
tember release with an announcement in
late august which is not that far away
we're already middle of july so in about
five six ish weeks we should know what
Apple has in store presumably we're
going to see a larger screen perhaps
four inches edge-to-edge display 8
megapixel camera probably manufactured
by Sony and of course all that iOS 5
goodness but I wouldn't keep your
fingers crossed unfortunately for any
type of 4G which you can all let out a
sigh no 4g no LTE and probably no hspa+
but you might be able to pick up an
iphone on tmobile and sprigs the two
carriers in the US that don't currently
have an iphone presumably both of these
new models will be available so the
iphone 5 and whatever the iphone 3gs
that it's like the call as they revamp
it and remodel it will all be out and
available for any carrier so you can
walk into any store and pick up an
iphone and walk out on your way Apple
loving way I suppose the next big rumor
is actually one story that we broke over
on TechnoBuffalo calm and that is the
blackberry torch to which rim hasn't
even announced yet or acknowledge that
it exists we had some very few hands on
time with it we're able to put it
head-to-head against the blackberry
torch 1 and walk you through what's
coming when we turned on the device we
saw it was completely inundated with
AT&amp;amp;T software ATT was the original
carrier of the torch one that certainly
makes sense they'd be the carrier of the
torch to our sources are telling us it
is going to be at least in the u.s. an
AT&amp;amp;T exclusive and is on pace to launch
towards the end of august early
September right when the bold 9900 or
9930 on the CDMA side is scheduled to
launch that will launch at the very
least on two carriers verizon and AT&amp;amp;T
presumably t-mobile will be picking that
up as well I believe they've announced
that they will but they may not be the
first carrier to start carrying it on
the GSM side and I'll filter down to
sprint and other regional carriers as
well so if your blackberry lover you
need BBM you love the physical keyboards
that is coming and coming very soon the
next bit of tasty tasty rumor comes from
google land if you're a fan of the
original nexus one or the samsung built
google nexus s we've got another google
phone coming for you this is the google
nexus prime perfect timing now it
transformers out all the transforming
optimus prime jokes are out there i can
say it and not through this prime voice
exes Optimus Prime I can't say it the
gun Nexus Optimus Prime the guy does it
in the movies vetted also guided in the
cartoons which is a fun bit of geek
trivia does a very very good job this is
presumably going to be built by Samsung
it's going to have something we've never
seen before a 720p screen which is going
to be dubbed Super AMOLED HD so we have
super amoled super amoled plus will now
have Super AMOLED HD I've been rumors
that this guy might sport a 4.5 inch or
larger screen it will be rocking the
very first phone to rock android 4.0 ice
cream sandwich and will presumably see
this just in
time for the holidays so if you're
waiting and you're looking wistfully at
all this dual core action coming out the
google nexus prime will perhaps be the
first quad-core phone that we see
running on Nvidia's KL platform which is
pretty darn badass four chords thing is
going to be an absolute screamer
hopefully battery life will be longer
than 45 minutes I want to take a quick
minute to thank our friends and sponsors
at Carbonite computer disasters will
eventually happen to everyone your
computer crashes gets a virus you drop
it it gets stolen by ninjas or elves
come and take it away but if you get
carbonite online backup before your
disaster before those elves break in
then there's no need to worry because
your files will be backed up
automatically safely and off-site and
it's super easy to get them back plus
you get anytime anywhere access to your
backup files from any computer or on
your smartphone or ipad with the free
Carbonite app can argue with free that's
pretty awesome always Cartwright
unlimited backup for your pc or mac
itches fifty nine dollars a year that's
less than five dollars a month but when
you use offer code techno te CH n no not
only are you showing your support for
TechnoBuffalo and our channel but you're
also gonna be able to get a free 15 day
trial with two months free if you decide
to buy so pretty awesome all the details
are on carbonite.com remember to use
offer code techno to get your free two
months with purchase and also again guy
showed your support for the show let's
go to the next rumor and the poor poor
pre three we saw it announced back in
February we've seen it show it's priya
SH faced a little bits here in there but
we don't ever released it yet we've got
the touch pad out that's waiting for a
touch to share partner it is all dressed
up and there's no one to take it to the
ball free to this is old i want the
three where's the pre three come on HP
release the pre three and release the
kraken the pre three is coming
supposedly but it's going to be coming
with a new processor very sneakily HP
replaced a processor specs on their own
website what we had before was a single
core 1.4 gigahertz chip and now HP is
listing a dual core
one point two gigahertz chip so that
should make for a much faster pre three
experience it seems a bit of a reactive
move to go ahead and have to reconfigure
the hardware at this late like the game
but hopefully they're doing it to make a
very competitive product you're still
going to get all that pre three pneus
that was announced many many many months
ago including a three point six inch
screen with a resolution of 480 x 800
which flows you keeping track at home is
wvga resolution what is this guy gonna
get released do you even care if it gets
released at this point it's so late in
the game there's so many new phones
coming out from Android you got windows
phone 7 mango coming you got iphone 5
rumors even rim is starting to make a
little bit of a noise do you care about
the pre three anymore I cared about the
pre three in March I cared about the pre
three in april i started to get annoyed
in May come June I was totally
ambivalent July I don't care anymore
your phones already obsolete you don't
announce something in the release it so
many months later I'm big fan of webos
but HP is following the tradition that
palm said before it by announcing
devices and having a really hard time
getting them to market so that
unfortunately it looks to be the fate of
the pre three am I wrong let me know in
the comments love to hear what you guys
have to say for all your tech news be
sure to check out TechnoBuffalo calm
where you can see my shiny face and
other better looking ones seven days a
week I am jon rettinger and I'll see you
and Noah kravitz in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
