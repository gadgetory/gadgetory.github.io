to you by harry's what's up guys Ron
Puri to hear from TechnoBuffalo over the
last couple of weeks we've been taking a
look at some of our camera gear we made
a video on our travel bag link above and
there's all that kind of awesome stuff
so today I wanted to take a look at two
of my new favorite pieces of gear
they're from DJI their two gimbals with
very different sizes the Osmo is I call
it the osmosis jones and the DJI Ronin
which a Niven is filming with right now
which you can see here so let's for dive
into the Osmo so a quick rundown for
those of you who don't know the Osmo is
essentially a handheld 4k camera on a
3-axis gimbal it's basically the same
thing as the Ronin the phone mounts into
the side and the gimbal stabilizes the
camera there's a thumb operator to move
the camera left and right like that up
down and you can check double tap the
trigger show Niven and triple tap to go
into selfie mode which is really really
cool
again that's since the blogger thing so
the awesome I think is really really
cool for beginning youtubers vloggers or
filmmakers want to use this as sort of a
backup cam just to pick up like random
stuff on set I do not think the camera
quality is good enough to use like an a
cam or something like that but it's a
hell of a lot better than something like
a GoPro just the color rendition skin
tones as you can see you can judge for
yourself I think it looks pretty damn
good Dogma is also modular which means
you can switch out the top camera right
now we're running with a Zen news x3 but
you can put an x5 or an x5 raw which are
Micro Four Thirds sensors which is
insane to have that ability this is
actually the camera they also use on the
DJI inspire which is their they're crazy
drone things pretty awesome what a my
only gripe with the Osmo is really the
app so the app is is fine it's not the
greatest but it gives you a lot of
manual control over the camera and show
that it connects do Wi-Fi which is not
as it good as it could be using
something like the Phantom from DJI that
connects via a lightning cable and so
just in this kind of situation I don't
see why they couldn't have done that
instead of having to sync via Wi-Fi then
open the app and just sort of keep going
back and forth it becomes a bit of a
hassle to sync when you're trying to run
in gun but once you have it set up it is
pretty good and one more gripe as we get
down to about 5% battery life is the
battery life we charge this probably 20
minutes ago I think
and this thing is dying on us quick so
I'm gonna wrap this up and move on to
the Ronan
Saji scene ever not bring their own and
it's basically just a giant version of
the Osmo it's really good we personally
use on the blackberry proof video which
you can see the linked here it's a 3
axis gimbal but it allows you to put
bigger cameras on it right now we have
an a7 s mark 2 on here you can set a
Panasonic gh4 this is the Ronin
M you can get the full size run into
take cameras like the red epic Canon
c100 it's pretty versatile overall
really cool not really an issue with the
Ronin but just something to bear in mind
it does get pretty heavy since you're
holding your arms out like this as you
can see Niven is doing it can get heavy
after a long day of filming something
that you don't run into the dodge Mel
obviously cuz it's you know granted my
shoulder kind of hurts but that's just a
problem because I need to lift more I'm
done a 3% battery ok so those are kind
of my quick thoughts on the DJI Ronin
and gods Moses Jones with Moses let me
know what you guys think in the comments
he's are two of my new favorite devices
for filming because they're just so
flexible and versatile and they let you
get so many different kinds of shots and
looks and using so many different kinds
of locations let us know what you guys
think in the comments below as Nevin
hits a wall awesome products by DJI they
do have their flaws if you also want
check out something like the movi m5 and
m10 they do stabilize a little bit
better but if you look them up their
price tags are way way higher that's it
for me guys thanks so much for watching
