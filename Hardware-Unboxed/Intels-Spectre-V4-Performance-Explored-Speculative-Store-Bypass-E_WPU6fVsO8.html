taking a look at the impact addressing
this spectra variant full-floor has on
Intel's coffee-like CPUs now back when
the meltdown and spectra vulnerabilities
were first made public earlier this year
we knew this was going to be an ongoing
process the initial patches didn't
address everything they addressed a
variant one known as meltdown and then
two spectra floors known as variant 2
and variant 3 recently though Intel and
Microsoft roll that updates to address
variant for a related speculative
execution attack dubbed speculative
store bypass speculative store bypass
effects not just Intel but also AMD and
ARM processors that said the AMD an ARM
processors can be addressed much more
easily via a simple software update so
if you keep your operating system and
web browser up-to-date you'll be
protected against variant 4
automatically if you've got an Intel
processor fully mitigating the issue
requires not just these software updates
but also a firmware update so in other
words a BIOS update Intel started
shipping microcode patches for variant
forward to its hardware partners in beta
form just a few months ago now and we're
only just starting to see board partners
pushing them out in fact to my knowledge
a seuss is the only board partner to do
so thus far however while the latest
round of bias updates from a seuss does
include the updated micro code for
variant 4 it's not enabled in Windows by
default for now it has to be manually
enabled by adding a few registry keys
it's likely at some point this will be
done automatically and I suspect
Microsoft is worried about a repeat of
the disaster they encountered earlier in
the UN addressing the first wave of
unrealities so this summer and they've
taken a more cautious approach Intel has
said enabling the fix will lead to
approximately a two to eight percent
decrease in performance and this was
observed when benchmarking with sis mark
2014 on client and server test systems
but I'm sure what many of you want to
know is what kind of performance impact
this will have on your system
particularly for games now for AMD users
there should be no impact at all but I
will look into this in another video
soon for now we're going to see what
kind of impact this has on those using a
coffee
CPU and please note for now we can't
test older systems as the BIOS updates
don't exist yet so for this test I'm
using the cry 780 700 the non K version
on the isuzu ROG Strix z 370 F gaming
motherboard using bass version one zero
zero two I'll be comparing results with
SSB enabled and disabled and the enabled
results will be labeled as pre update
and the disabled as spectra v4 update so
with that let's get to the results first
up we have this Cinebench r15 results
and here we see no changes at all with
the variant for patch enabled the single
thread score goes unchanged and the same
is true for the multi threaded score as
well three points isn't well within the
margin of error here the CPU Z benchmark
here we saw a 3% decrease for the single
thread test but just a 1% decrease for
the multi-threaded test and those
results were repeatable over and over
again
the corona benchmark was run half a
dozen times for each configuration and
we found that the variant for
mitigations impacted performance by just
a single percent not a lot but we did
consistently see a 1% reduction in
performance here we see no change in
performance when testing with 7-zip less
than 1% difference between the two test
configurations now moving on to some
gaming and we find that little has
changed when benchmarking with
battlefield 1 the 1% low result was
consistently lower with the variant 4
update enabled that said we're only
talking about a 2% drop-off in
performance far cry 5 only saw a one and
a half percent drop off for the average
framerate with a 1% change for the
minimum and although the variant 4
update did make the core i7 8700
consistently slower by 1 to 2 FPS it's
not exactly a big performance here we
again only see a 1 to 2 FPS hit when
testing with Rainbow six siege so not
much else to say there and then finally
I took a look at for at night and here
we do see a slightly larger 3% drop off
for the average frame rate as well as
the frame time performance again not a
big change but we were consistently
seeing a 4 to 5 FPS drop in performance
so Intel claimed a 2 to 8 percent
performance it when addressing the
variant for vulnerability by disabling
speculative store by past but our tests
it looks more like just
one two three percent the impact for
Linux users appears to be more in line
with intel's own claim and we believe
that comes down to the windows scheduler
which is less efficient than the linux
scheduler previously we found when
patching variant one two and three this
reduced the gaming performance of the
core i7 eighty seven hundred k by up to
five percent though for the most part we
only saw a zero to three percent
decrease in framerate very four has seen
a further one to three percent dip in
performance though this time we were
testing with the non k 8700 but the
margins should be much the same across
the entire range what this all means is
since december last year the game
informative intel's coffee-like CPUs is
down by one to six percent for the most
part we're likely only talking one to
two FPS in games pushing over 60 FPS and
up to five FPS far higher refresh rate
gaming again not a big deal overall but
it's worth keeping in mind that intel
will suffer an IPC hit because of this
with future architectures that address
these vulnerabilities at a hardware
level for now though those of you who
own an eighth generation intel core
processor needn't worry about you came
is turning into a slideshow the
performance impact isn't that
significant that said even if it was we
would strongly recommend you update your
bias and enable the mitigations as soon
as possible because remember just like
Daniel Ricciardo hackers like I'm
vulnerable and in fact this is gonna do
it for this one for now if you did enjoy
