today's video it might surprise you to
learn that we're not benchmarking a new
cpu apu or even a GPU instead we're
checking out a slick new computer case
from corsair i'm sure many of you are
familiar with the Obsidian series and
many of the models like the massive 900
d or the slightly less massive 750 d
have been around for some time now and
they're still popular choices today in
fact it's been quite a few years since
Corsair refresh the Obsidian lineup with
a new face but today that all changes
with the introduction of the Obsidian
series 500 d and it's certainly a
departure from the norm with the
exception of the original 550d every
obsidian model has followed the exact
same design cues the 500 d though throws
everything out the window Corsair says
the 500 DS a state-of-the-art mid tower
design for enthusiasts featuring smoked
tempered glass side doors with premium
aluminium trimmings obviously looks are
subjective but I think most will agree
that the new 500 d is a sleek looking
computer case that's a bit more
adventurous than the traditional
obsidian cases before we get into the
looks I would like to just quickly note
this mid-town measures 508 millimeters
tall 502 millimeters deep and 233
millimeters wide empty it tips the
scales at 10.25 kilograms which is
reasonable given the size and the sheer
amount of glass that's included Corsair
has also slapped it with an MSRP of a
hundred and forty dollars u.s. but we'll
talk more about the value aspect of this
case towards the end of the video
getting back to the design the case
manages to merge clean lines with subtle
curves really well on the front panel is
a great example of this at first the
front panel appears to be a solid piece
of brushed aluminium but it's actually
mostly plastic that's then wrapped in a
sheet of thin brushed aluminium I can't
help but feel a solid aluminium panel
would have probably worked better here
and matched the side panels a lot better
speaking of the door panels they mostly
smoked tempered glass but the leading
edges they are attached to some thick
aluminium trimmings which not just help
make up the front panel but they also
act as handle so that's creative and it
looks very good
both the left and right side tempered
glass panels are hinged for quick and
convenient access it was also great to
find that when laying the case down flat
which makes it a bit easier to install
hardware inside that the hinged doors
didn't just fall off as this is a
problem I've run into with a few other
cases believe it or not to avoid this
happening Corsair has actually placed a
screw at the top of the hinge stopping
it from being able to move past that and
if you do want to remove the hinge then
you have to undo the screw first and
then it simply slides out of place when
it comes to opening and closing the
doors they actually lock in a place
really nicely using magnets though I did
notice a few times when moving the case
around so that is to say leaning on its
side or something like that the doors
would just fly open and smashing or
whatever was in their way so you best be
careful all that and trying to hold the
doors shut as you move the case around
moving around to the top of the case we
find an interesting sort of winged type
looking top panel constructed entirely
from aluminium it's also raised up at
the sides to allow for better airflow
but there are a heap of sort of
triangular shape ventilation straight
down the middle of it as well so plenty
of ventilation on this top panel then at
the front in the gap between where the
top and front panels meet there's a
smart little IO panel featuring two USB
3.0 ports a power reset button two audio
jacks and wait for it a USB 3.1 gen2
type-c port now I know a lot of you guys
will appreciate that so good stuff there
Corsair underneath the case there really
isn't anything too exciting going on
there's four pretty standard looking
plastic feet and a removable dust filter
for the PSU then finally around the back
it's also a pretty standard affair you
have seven expansion slots PSU in the
bottom of course and a rear-mounted 120
millimeter fan which we'll look at a bit
more closely in a moment before jumping
inside and checking out the interior of
the 500e I should just note that there
is also a large removable dust filter in
the top and front of the case and these
are both very easy to get up the top
filter is held in place by four magnets
while the front filter gets eight both
can be easily removed in a matter of
seconds without the need of tools so
it's a really great design by Corsair
now getting inside the case we find a
separate but quite compact basement
section for the PSU and
can be opened up if need be for extra
long PS use Corsairs also provided a
grommet in the top of the PSU cover for
running power cables to say your
graphics card all two-and-a-half inch
and three and a half inch storage is
found behind the motherboard train here
you can fit two three and a half inch
drives and three two and a half inch
drives Corsairs also provided removable
drive trays for mounting these drives
and in the case of the three-and-a-half
inch models it's a tool of design for
those of you after a few more storage
options I suspect at some point you will
be able to purchase a drive cage that'll
probably feature something like three
more trays and that'll sit adjacent from
the PSU shroud that location by default
though is reserved for those wanting to
install liquid cooling gear and here you
could install a pump and reservoir combo
for example Corsairs also provided
mounting holes for all the commonly used
kits speaking of liquid cooling the 500d
has room for up to a 280 millimeter or
360 millimetre radiator in the front a
120 millimeter radiator in the back and
a 240 millimeter or 280 millimeter
radiator in the top course has also made
the installation of the radiators and
fans very easy by including removable
fan trays and these can be found in the
top and front of the case essentially
what these fan trays allow you to do is
install the radiator and fans or just
the fans whatever you're going for but
you can do this outside of the case so
you don't have to work in the
confinement of the case itself as you
might have guessed given the radiator
support you can install either three 120
millimeter or two 140 millimeter fans in
the front and two 120 millimeter or 140
millimeter fans on the top by default
the 500 D comes with a 120 millimeter
pre-installed fan in the front it's in
the central location and then there's
one also in the rear when it comes to
clearance the 500 D will support
graphics cards as long as 317
millimeters so that covers pretty much
every model I'm aware of CPU coolers can
stand as tall as 170 millimeters and
again that covers pretty much all of
them then we have the PSU which can
stretch as long as 225 millimeters so
again you'll be hard-pressed to find
something that doesn't fit in this
generously sized mid tower case Corsair
has also made it possible to not just
install full-length graphics cards but
you can also take advantage of the new
vertical mounting fad that really took
off last year that said I don't really
recommend you take advantage of this
feature if you can help yourself with an
air-cooled graphics card for example it
just sits simply too close to the glass
panel and this will really restrict
airflow additionally you will need to
purchase the PCIe riser cable separately
and Corsair says that this standalone
accessory will be available from them
soon these things though they're never
cheap at a good quality shielded version
will usually set your back well over 50
dollars u.s. and I've found that even
the good ones do introduce a small
amount of latency so keep that in mind
as well finally when it comes to cable
management the 500 D looks after you
very well and it's really just a
pleasure to build in course areas
included they're removable cable routing
cover which makes it possible to create
a build that looks clean from all angles
which is important given it has glass
panels on both sides making life easier
our included velcro straps and cable
routing grommets for quick and easy
cable routing for my test build I
installed the MSI X 399 Pro carbon a/c
of standard ATX motherboards supporting
the big and bold thread Ripper CPUs and
of course I installed the granddaddy 419
50 X the graphics card of choice was the
MSI GTX 1080 TI trio and what a beast
that thing is then in terms of cooling I
really wanted to give the corsair h 150
i pro whirl but unfortunately right now
it doesn't support the tier 4 socket so
instead I was forced to test with the
naktu at U 14 s TR 4 SP 3 as well as the
Animax lick Tec 280 TR for all-in-one
liquid cooler and I do believe it's
called a lick tech but not a hundred
percent sure on that one anyway moving
along
although the naktu au 14s stands 165
millimeters tall it will fit with room
to spare and with the out of the box fan
configuration that is to say the - 120
millimeter fans that come pre-installed
in the 500 D temperatures were great the
CPU ran at just 61 degrees and a full
load and the GT X 1080 Ti trio from MSI
never went above 58 degrees when gaming
so that is an exceptional result so in
terms of temperatures it seems quite
good but I really just wanted to dress
the 500d up so I stripped
the stock fans and replace them of
course as flashy high airflow ml series
and I installed the Animax lick tech 280
at the same time this meant we now had
three 120 millimeter ml fans in the
front drawing air in and two 140
millimeter ml fans on the top pushing
air out through the lick tech 280
millimeter radiator then finally for
something a little bit different I went
with a 120 millimeter ll model in the
rear use that as an exhaust fan and well
what an RGB bonanza it was this
configuration dropped the gtx 980ti trio
low temp down to just 52 degrees and the
lick tech 280 saw the 1950 x max out at
just 58 degrees which again it's just
another exceptional result both the CPU
and GPU were left stock for these tests
I actually haven't had time to tinker
with the overclocking but this is
certainly something I would like to
explore with this system in a future
video in order to really show off the
Obsidian series 500d and all of the
glorious PC hardware inside you really
need to install a few LED light strips
and we're certainly not opposed to some
RGB goodness here at harbor unboxed as
long as it's not a case of form over
function anyway I feel like the 500d
does a good job of balancing looks with
practicality
it's a sleek looking case that doesn't
sacrifice airflow to give that clean
look that a lot of cases seem to be
doing at the moment and build quality is
extremely high as you would expect from
a corsair case and the features that it
does include are of the highest quality
most mid towers are priced between 75
and $100 u.s. so the 500 d is certainly
a premium product and you could fault
Corsair for not providing any extras
such as LED light strips or even a fan
controller I personally would have liked
to see at least one of these things
included for the hundred and forty
dollar u.s. asking price but I'm also
grateful that the features that are
included such as the hinge tempered
glass doors or of the highest quality
it's also worth noting the 750 d can
often be had for around $130 u.s.
despite the fact that it does have a 160
dollar US MSRP so chances are it won't
be too long before you can get the 500 d
and a more competitive price so in a
nutshell the 500 e is a well put
together case that's really second to
none
in terms of design and build quality
it's a little pricey at 140 dollars u.s.
but we've come to expect a premium from
Corsair for their higher-end products
overall though I really like what the
obsidian series 500d has to offer and I
think I found my new backdrop PC for
2018 and that's going to do it for this
one if you enjoyed the video then be
