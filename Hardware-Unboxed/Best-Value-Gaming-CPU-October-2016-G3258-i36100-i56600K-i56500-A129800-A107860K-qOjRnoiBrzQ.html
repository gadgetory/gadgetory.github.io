a great place to start with the CPU if
your goal is to build a cost-effective
gaming rig then I've got a few CPU
recommendations for you let's take a
look the honeymoon period is an overfit
intel's unlocked dual core pentium
processor the Haswell base g3 two five
eight comes clocked at 3.2 gigahertz out
of the box there's no trouble pushing
past four gigahertz for some seriously
respectable single and dual thread
performance of course you need a z97
motherboard but there are plenty of sub
$100 options to choose from should you
not be interested in overclocking that I
suggest looking into Intel's latest LGA
1151 platform the core i3 6100 is a
personal favorite of mine clocked at 3.7
gigahertz it's plenty fast and with
hyper-threading support multi-threaded
tasks aren't an issue I found even the
slower 3.2 gigahertz low-voltage model
is more than capable of getting the most
out of a sub $200 GPU this makes it an
ideal budget gaming option if your
budget allows for it I feel the more
expensive Core i5 processors are
actually the best value option for
gamers a processor such as the core i5
6600 K provides more than enough oomph
to tackle any modern game and you won't
see a noticeable performance improvement
by moving to the more expensive car
sever model this is still true when
looking at the latest DirectX 12 titles
as well unless you're running a pair of
tight next graphics cards in SLI then
there really isn't much need to invest
in anything more extreme than 6,600 K if
you don't plan on overclocking then the
slightly cheaper 6500 will be just as
good the 6500 operates all four cores at
3.2 gigahertz and it can boost as high
as 3.6 ki Hertz depending on the
workload I found for the vast majority
of triple-a gaming titles out there the
core i5 6500 provides roughly the same
performance
that's my overclocked 6700 K when paired
with graphics cards as fast the GTX 1080
for those of you looking to build an
ultra budget gaming PC without a
graphics card we recommend an AMD APU J
10 78-60 KS stands out as one of the
best options for playing eSports titles
such as rocket league dota 2 csgo and
overwatch for example AMD is a 1076
kay is part of the Kaveri refresh at
Bose for threads that operated a base
frequency of 3.6 gigahertz what's key
here is the integrated radeon r7
graphics featuring eight CEUs for a
total of 512 SP use the most of any apu
seen yet in order to get the most out of
the 1878 60 KS GPU be sure to pair with
ddr3 2400 memory as for the motherboard
there are plenty of really good
cost-effective AMD 888 X options to
choose from if you can hold off a bit
longer
AMD's new bristol ridge apu should
become available soon based on the new a
m4 platform they take advantage of high
clocked ddr4 memory and more importantly
take advantage of a more modern and
efficient CPU architecture AMD is
detailed several new AP use and standout
product is the a12 9800 using an updated
version of a Mia's Carrizo architecture
this is another four threaded apu
featuring 512 SPU enable GPU running it
up to one point one gigahertz of course
pricing and availability is still
unknown though we are expecting them to
start showing up in retail channels
shortly so those are my picks right now
for the best value gaming CPUs if you've
got any questions and let me know in the
comments I'm your host Matt as always
and I'll see you guys next time cheers
guys for joining me for another episode
of hardware unbox so those of you that
already support the channel thank you so
much it's truly appreciated and to those
of you that would like to support the
channel directly I do have Amazon links
and a patron link in the video
description below
thanks a lot and I'll see you guys next
