X SLI trooper 4k monitor experience I've
been working hard on getting a full
review together that'll show performance
across a bunch of games with graphs
galore but I thought it would be good to
give you a little preview first I've
chosen a few games work pretty well to
show you what it looks like so sit back
relax and enjoy first up is Far Cry
primal with everything maxed out we're
sitting right around 40 FPS for the most
part and it didn't fluctuate too much
from this point in the section when I
was playing caveman had no chance of
sneaking up on me on this day
next up was rising the true meter
another game I know to work pretty well
with SLI and surround aspires running
around and exploring these caves I was
getting a consistent 50 FPS and out here
in the temple it was around the same
again all the graphical settings were
set to their maximum
this flame we'll take a look at his Star
Wars Battlefront this game provides a
pretty good surround experience and
scales well with us alive the two great
looking games it is then it was pretty
immersive with world flying by on the
extra to streaming framerate wires we
were getting consistent 50 FPS in this
test which was obviously one of the
better results
the last game I checked out was GTA 5
and this extremely well refined game
worked pretty spectacularly with us
around setup and a pair of disgustingly
good graphics cards with this super
resolution we were still able to get
around 60fps and this was probably the
best gaming experience I have with the
triple monitors
so what did you guys think how many of
you guys messed around with triple
monitor setups as I said at the start
keep an eye up for a full review
including tight necks SLI performance
did you guys enjoy this video let me
know in the comments I'm your host Matt

time cheers guys for joining me for
