nothing short of spaceship s to this
point perhaps aside from the much-loved
G 710 that led the way some time ago you
can't help it immediately notice that in
terms of aesthetics the new G 810 of
Ryan spectrums gone back to basic shapes
offering a simple and straightforward
rectangular design being not however as
suggested by the spectrum moniker this
mechanical keyboard stays true to its
gaming heart and offers full
individually backlit RGB lighting few
last year we were introduced to Logitech
so in romaji switches for the g9 10
Orion's fire not quite like them the 25%
faster actuation was detectable and I
did like the tactile feedback that they
provided
having said that I'm very accustomed to
Cherry MX blue switches we should to
offer a much more snappy and clicky type
of feedback quite different to the Roma
G's the softer roma g switches are
certainly a lot quieter that's for sure
with the wealth of mechanical switches
available today it really comes down to
personal preference no switch is
objectively better than another in my
opinion personally Cherry MX Blues are
still my favorite I love that
over-the-top tactile and aural feedback
on every keystroke now as I mentioned
the g8n 4 goes the extravagant geometry
of its predecessors and it's a nice
refreshing change with a design that
reminds me quite a lot of the Corsair
strafe the Orion spectrum offers a much
more elegant and stylish appearance that
can fit into an office setting as well
as a LAN party the g8n wastes no space
either well it does include the 10 key
numpad and a few media buttons the key
layout presses right up to each edge
aside from the top and there's no rest
rest included I'm a big fan of a nice
big removable wrist rest so this would
have been a welcome inclusion but
Logitech have clearly gone for a space
efficient design this time around and
it's come off nicely
keeping with this space efficient theme
the g8 M spares the inclusion of any
dedicated macro keys although it does
include a Windows lock key
backlighting toggle and media keys
including a nice wide volume wheel which
allows accurate
look and single-handed volume adjustment
on the flyer browning out the face of
the keyboard is a sleek backlit Logitech
G logo at the top left corner on the
bottom we've got a nice diagonal
contours that you basically never see
but then also something pretty nifty the
little keyboard legs have three
different heights you can set the
keyboard too as well as the flat option
so you can tweak this to your personal
preference the GI 10 is of course
managed by the well-polished and
powerful logitech gaming software within
you can create profiles with different
games and applications create all kinds
of RGB lighting patterns and effects
reprogram specific keys and much much
more
the lighting options are nice and easy
to mess around with and if you like me
you don't to sit there for 10 hours
creating your own fancy pattern just
give me some cool presets and let me
choose one this is certainly a strength
of the logitech gaming software and you
can have waves of rainbows gliding
across the keys in moments the software
will also scan for installed games in
your system and can offer predefined
lighting profiles for each one pretty
nifty this makes it super easy to
customize profiles for each game too
performance wise g8n does everything
it's supposed to do
the keys are of course super responsive
and the faster actuation does feel nice
under the finger I really think your
performance of a keyboard is gonna have
a lot to do with how much practice
you've had and how many hours you put in
with those specific switches the Gio 10
and Roma G's aren't lucky in any area if
you have someone that relies on having
extra dedicated macro keys and you can
build a very good relationship with the
Orion spectrum over time overall I
really like the g8n Orien spectrum it's
sleek flat form and particular appeals
to me over Logitech some previous
offerings I can see this keyboard being
a popular choice the more mature gaming
for this reason logitech gaming software
as a gear strength and although they are
my absolute favorite
I'm a fan of the romaji switches and
there are a nice chance to use for five
or so days the g8n won't be taking you
over as my daily driver because I'm big
on wrist rest and find the pastor of a
USB pass-through very useful however I
can say the g8n is a very nice solution
I would have no trouble recommending it
at all at 159 USD or $219 redos it's a
little pricey for its feature set in my
but game is are getting used to these
kinds of prices or are they perhaps
Logitech we've forced to become more
aggressive on pricing over the coming
weeks it really depends on how much
gamers gobble these things up so as the
g8 anarchy board you'll be considering
what's your favorite logitech gaming
keyboard let me know in the poll and if
