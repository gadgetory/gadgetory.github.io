today's viewers bug is probably not the
usual sort of content we put up on the
channel you know with loads of
benchmarks and that sort of thing I'm
just going to have a chat with you guys
about my thread Ripper editing rig a bit
of an update to the build video I did
nearly a month ago to give you a bit
more info on how the system is doing a
few other upgrades I needed to make and
just our general thoughts on where we've
seen benefits to upgrading hardware in
our workstations so far thread Ripper
has been an enormous update to my
workflow I think we've mentioned a few
times in the past but both Steve and I
use Adobe Premiere for editing together
these videos and the difference in
performance between the thread Ripper
2950 X and the Rison 7 1700 X I was
using previously is massive
but before we get into that this video
has been sponsored by Vikings war of
clans a very addictive MMO iOS and
Android devices
inspired by PC strategy games from the
90s like Age of Empires one of my
personal favorites
in fact our soldiers might remember when
Age of Empires was included in Kellogg's
cereal boxes but I guess that might be a
story for another time
anyway Vikings were of clans is similar
to those lots of games and it has
amazing graphics for a mobile title
allows you to choose your own play style
and you can join in the fun with more
than 20 million online players fighting
over resources forging alliances and
competing in life events support

about thread Ripper obviously the big
one is rendering performance when we set
a video to encode with 2950 X is at
least twice as fast the big game
graphics settings comparison videos
you've seen before those were taking
between two and a half to three hours to
render on the Rison 7 1,700 X when you
ask premier to spit out I guess 4k 60fps
h.264 and a hundred megabits per second
using a to parsing code with a bunch of
GPU accelerated effects an 8 core CPU is
going to struggle with the 2950 X though
those encodes now taking roughly 50
minutes or so to complete so I guess
that's more than a 2x improvement but
it's really more than just rendering
performance the 1,700 X was absolutely
choked up to
maxximum when rendering those videos and
that made using my pc if anything else
pretty painful we're talking of loading
chrome tabs editing some Excel
spreadsheets or creating our YouTube
thumbnail in Photoshop
none of those tasks were responsive when
the 1700 X was told to render to my
surprise the 2950 X is pretty different
in that regard even when the CPU is
spending most of the time encoding
there's still a bit of headroom to allow
me to say create that YouTube thumbnail
while the encode is happening doing that
sort of simultaneous task isn't as fast
as if the CPU have been you know weren't
being used but at least other apps are
actually usable now during the rendering
process which is a godsend for
productivity especially when you're
previously the encodes would take nearly
three hours that's three hours I
couldn't really use my PC for anything
else I've also heard a few reports
suggesting Intel CPUs are faster at the
actual editing process I'm talking about
scrubbing through the timeline applying
effects playing the video moving through
the you know the premiere interface that
sort of thing I did notice a few delays
pauses slowdowns and the like with my
1700 X but the 2950 X again to my
surprise has actually been a noticeable
upgrade to premieres responsiveness
things like scrubbing a faster and
smoother with more frames rendered
during the scrub and skipping along the
timeline then hitting play is no instant
rather than say a half second delay
before the footage starts I did a bit of
experimenting with similar types of
actions on my 8700 K test rig and I
couldn't make out a significant
difference in responsiveness compared to
the 2950 X it's certainly not something
I'd normally notice while editing
previously the 8700 K was noticeably
more responsive than 17-hundred X so
very happy with how the 2950 X has
improved things of course the 8700 K was
always inferior to both the 1700 x and
thread Ripper for encoding which is why
I didn't consider it for my editing rig
in the past I also mentioned previously
that I used my editing room for gaming
again so no real change to performance
between the 2950 X and the 1700 X as
expected in fact if anything the 2950 X
is a bit faster in CPU demanding games
nothing I'm usually CPU bottleneck even
with the RT X 28 G I'm almost always GPU
bottlenecked at 34 40 by 1440 and yes
I've used an ultra-wide mana for gaming
it's the acer Predator X 34 in case
you're wondering one of the comments I
did see a fair bit on the thread with
build year was in relation to the CPU
cooler
they're Corsair h 150 i pro doesn't have
full tr4 HS coverage however this
actually isn't a big deal I'm not seeing
any hotspots and under full load
temperatures are sitting around the 65
degrees Celsius mark yes I guess it
probably would be cooler had I used a
cooler with full IHS coverage but it's
not actually necessary to get decent
cooling performance and for us to make
the video it was actually a lot easier
to work with Corsair to get the bulk of
the components sometimes with these
sorts of things
you know the logistics of actually
making a video wins out over getting
absolute top of line components which in
this case I didn't really need anyway
that said I haven't spent a lot of time
overclocking and I probably won't I'd
have to go all out to get better
performance than xfr and precision
Brewster already providing and I don't
want to risk stability when I'm working
on tone you know time-sensitive projects
it's with overclocking that you'd
normally want a cooler with full HS
coverage began for my rigs not really
necessary also if I was seeing very high
temperatures I probably want that larger
cold plate but yeah that wasn't the case
either but there were some things I
needed to upgrade and I'll talk you
through those now the big one is memory
capacity 32 gigabytes is simply not
enough for editing our 4k videos without
running into capacity bottlenecks with
my 1700 X I was mostly CPU bottleneck
throughout the editing and encoding
process but with fred.ropp I was running
into nasty Ram capacity bottlenecks
which were preventing the 2950 X
domination it's full performance
especially when overlaying you know
multiple 4k videos at once my RAM usage
would be pegged to the maximum basically
all the time so it's clear that I needed
more RAM and thankfully team group were
able to help out they provided 64
gigabytes of their T force nighthawk RGB
ddr4 we've got two kits here I've used
this stuff before and it looks I reckon
especially awesome in my third Ripper
build you can see it in there at the
moment because you have dims on both
sides of the CPU so that RGB lighting
flanks the RGB cooler visuals don't
really matter for an editing input so
it's nice to have a system that looks
good as well as being practical anyway
it's not the RGB lighting that matters
it's the specific modules team group
provided I specifically wanted for 16
gigabytes ticks rather than eight eight
gigabyte sticks just in case I need to
go up to 128 gigabytes in the future
there's really no other advantage to
four times sixteen gig over eight times
eight gig for this setup since IMC does
performed better with fewer dims but
that's largely negated when using jewel
ranked 16 gig modules in any case team
group provided to 32 gig kits at 3200 CL
16 speeds they were pretty similar to
this this is actually a three thousand
kit but similar enough this is Samsung
bead iron memory so it's the good stuff
and before you ask I guess I haven't
played around with timings yet so to see
if I could tighten those up any further
I suspect I can and my 2950 axe has no
trouble with 3200 CL 16 in a 4 x 16
gigabyte configuration as expected with
16 gig rather than 32 gig installed a
lot of my performance problems I was
running into have been solved entirely
especially when trying to play back
parts of those graphics comparison
videos whether you know like five pieces
of 4k footage overlaid with 32 gig of
ram that section would be played back at
like 1 to 2 FPS with 64 gig premiere
blows up to about 50 gig of ram and
playback is much smoother it's also
decreased render times by a small amount
for those graphics comparison videos and
this sort of application we're having 64
gig of ram could be the difference
between decent performance and poor
performance as we've mentioned many
times in the past you really don't need
more than 16 gig for gaming and modern
titles or any sort of basic productivity
up is when you going crazy in Premiere
or working with large datasets the
pushing up to near 32 gigs 64 gig and
even 128 gig can make a difference
unless you're doing something like that
or a heavily multi tasking we really
don't recommend spending big on Ram
capacity in fact before I switch to 64
gig 32 gig was more than enough for
basically everything else I use my PC
for even working with more basic
projects in premiere with 4k footage 32
gig was fine so if I was recommending a
system for a Content credit still go
with 32 key to begin with 16 gig won't
be enough but for a lot of people you
probably won't see the benefits from
upping that to 64 gig so that should
give you guys a bit of a basic rundown
of when we've seen the benefits from
higher memory capacities in our workflow
I guess 16 gig is the sweet spot for
gamers 32 gig is what you want as a
content creator with those higher
capacities only necessary for niche or
specialist tasks the other thing I added
in was a one terabyte Samsung and 970
Evo SSD and this was to use as a scratch
disk for Prem
yeah previously I had just a 500 gig
PCIe storage drive in there and that was
cutting a bit fine if I was working on
you know multiple projects we tend to
make you know hundreds of gigabytes for
each of our individual videos that we're
uploading the 970 Evo provides a handy
random access performance boost as well
which is helped with editing performance
I was tossing up between the 970 Pro and
the 970 Eero the Pro is a bit faster but
the Evo's have better bang for your buck
by that's why I went with it for this
one while PCIe nvme SSDs are nice I
actually think a lot of people wouldn't
be able to tell the difference between
PCIe and SATA SSDs for general things
like app loading windows booting system
responsiveness productivity tasks you
know and even game loading in
performance having recently built a few
systems that use SATA drives or sizes
their boot drives there's honestly there
isn't a big difference when you bump
those up to an nvme dry perhaps not as
large as the cost difference would
suggest in a lot of cases I think buyers
would be happier with a larger capacity
sided drive than a smaller capacity nvme
drive for general sort of things where
PCIe nvme drives become really handy in
these sorts of demanding workloads where
storage is constantly being accessed
you're having those blazing fast
sequential speeds backed up with great
random performance does hunk noticeably
for premiere time line performance at
those times when you're asking the drive
for data and needing to load stuff into
RAM but for a lot of other tasks they
don't benefit significantly from faster
storage usually there are bottlenecks
elsewhere like CPU performance so before
you buy an nvme drive it's always worth
looking at your workloads and seeing
whether faster storage would benefit you
compared to what you get with a solid
drive I guess I said for this video just
going over some updates with the thread
Ripper build and a bit more insight into
what we use at Hardware box as content
credits the hardware we need to do our
jobs and I guess as well where we've
seen upgrades impact our work for the
most there so if you like these sorts of
videos because I find it interesting
when other creators talk about how what
you know what they use to create videos
and how they go about it so hopefully a
few of you have found this video
interesting next up for me will probably
be sorting out a better system for
archiving storage on hard drives
currently it's a bit of a mess of hand
here with drive everywhere definitely a
better solution to that what else I
guess you can subscribe for more
