have a quick little sunday video for you
though I always say quick and they never
end up being that quick anyway I have a
video for you and yeah it's a follow-up
to the unboxing video that we did
earlier in the week if you missed it on
Monday we've got to unbox the new 2nd
gen and thread Ripper CPUs along with
MSI's x3 900 and creation motherboard
this one here the heat sinks are off but
I'll talk about that more later and we
got the absolutely massive Wraith Ripper
cooler in the unboxing video I suggested
that if I had time I could create a
build video with the thread Ripper 2990
WX the msi extra 9 creation and of
course the wraith ripper by making that
suggestion
it seems I'd pretty much committed
myself to the build video giving the
overwhelming response that I got from
that suggestion a lot of you guys wanted
me to make it happen so yeah here I am
making it happen so you might have
noticed that the complete system is
actually right here behind me on the
ground I filmed this kind of the wrong
way around a different order to how we
normally do the process but I was up
late last night putting the building
together it's about the only time I had
and I don't really want to film the
intro and talk about it late last night
so I've built it but I filmed the
process so we can check that out and
then after that I will talk a bit more
about the final product before we get to
that though please note as you can see
here well some of you might not actually
recognize what this is if you especially
if even watch any Computex coverage but
I have built inside the thermal take at
level 20 GT case which was announced
during the Computex trade show and you
got to see builds and things on that
depending on who you watched but it will
be officially released to the public I
believe this week so yeah something to
look out for sand we can have a bit of a
look at it and see how the thread refer
processor goes in it so anyway since
I've had this case sitting around the
studio taking up quite a bit of space I
thought what better time to put together
a build we can take advantage of the
twenty nine ninety WX and the Wraith
River and stick it all in there actually
look pretty good
I think it looks pretty good but we'll
get to that in a moment so yeah time to
cue up a smooth tune and show you guys
the build process
okay so there you have it my first 32
core 64 thread workstation build and
arts a bit awkward here I couldn't
really fit me and the computer in that
well so hopefully this shot doesn't look
too bad
and hopefully the microphone isn't
picking up too much noise from the fans
I'm not super loud but this close to the
microphone there might be louder than
you would expect them to be otherwise
anyway another issue I realized that the
RGB lighting is a bit hippie dippie bit
rainbow festival I was going to
synchronize them all and go with one or
two colors but I just ran out of time to
do that so with limited time we have the
thread Ripper rainbow build speaking of
time are massive and I do mean massive
review of the 2990 WX and 2950 x and
will be online at this time tomorrow so
yeah make sure you check that out it is
our longest ever day 1 video I've spent
every waking hour and they haven't been
many hours where I was asleep so yeah
it's been a busy week I easily put in
over 100 hours as crazy as that sounds I
definitely put in over 100 hours on this
content piece so it's very long it's a
very in-depth I hope you guys enjoy it
anyway getting back to this build video
I did attempt to configure the RGB
lighting although I was tight on time I
quickly did an install of Windows and
set it all up unfortunately I couldn't
get thermaltake string + software
working on the MSI x3 and I'm bored so
not sure if that was just an issue that
I ran into something that could have
been overcome with a bit more time or if
there's a fundamental problem there that
needs a new version not quite sure on
that one I don't know if I have I don't
think I have the software to control the
right the Ripper so that's something I
have to get from probably Coolermaster
not sure on that one and the other
problem I ran into with hi GB lighting
was the asou or a sync lighting only
worked for the top Vega 64 graphics card
and not the bottom one so I could only
yeah sync up the lighting on the top one
so that I just bailed on that idea
because it wasn't really worth it if
only one card was synced up and then
what else did I run into with the RGB
lighting it was one
thing actually it wasn't any I ran
into it was a suggestion
I think Thermaltake it would be wise to
include a hardware controller like an
inline optional control that you can put
in instead of connecting the USB cable
to the motherboard because if it doesn't
work and you can't use the software
you're stuck with rainbow fans and
although it's kind of annoying and if
you just want a red or blue or whatever
solid color with maybe some basic
effects and inline controller would be
awesome as far as I know they don't
include that I could be wrong I know
deep cool include that I didn't see
anything like that in the package that
said there were a few things missing
from my package but anyway if they don't
include it an inline like Hardware
controller for the RGB lighting would be
much appreciated as for the build itself
it was pretty straightforward as you can
see the level 20 GT is a large heavy
case I think there's really no other way
to put it it's a nice looking case but
it's very large and heavier with the
glass panels pretty much on every side
so you're the left and the right the
front and the top has a glass panel so
it makes the case very heavy considering
its dimensions but oh yeah nice looking
case I've got a few notes on the build
so I'll share those now and yeah go
there some feedback some constructive
criticism let's say well on that note
though of course this was just a build
video I'm just adding a few extra bits
of information it's in no way a review
so yeah don't expect a full in-depth
review or anything like that I can do
that later on but yeah this isn't that
one of the issues I ran into with the
build it's not a big issue but it was
one of the smaller issues I ran into was
the cable management there is a
reasonable amount of quite a large
amount of room really I mean probably
not as much as you'd expect for such a
massive case but there is still this
ample room in the back for cable
management the problem I've sort of had
with it the there's not enough anchor
points and things like that to cable tie
cables to and sort of separate things so
yeah I was a bit disappointed with the
lack of management let's say in the the
cable management section that makes
sense not a big issue that one but one
that was well certainly a bigger issue
is it there's really no cable routing in
the motherboard tray there are three
grommets I believe there was Sorrenti
where I covered them up quite quickly
with the x3 anion Croatian motherboard
that's the thing with an extender
ATX motherboard despite the fact that
this is a truly massive case you cover
all the cable management with that
motherboard so there's simply no way to
connect things like the 24 pin power
cable luckily in my situation I had some
individually sleeved cables which can
pack down quite flat so I was able to
put them under the motherboard and then
wrap them around certainly not a
traditional way of installing the 24 pin
power cable or even really a recommended
one but I got away with it in this
instance via the complete lack of cable
routing when using a large motherboard
is very disappointing especially in such
a massive case another issue I ran into
though this one should just be a problem
for my early sample I don't imagine that
the production cases will have this
problem but anyway it is the key so you
need a key or you should have a key to
unlock the doors and my sample there's
this that's the left and the right door
mind you my sample didn't come with the
keys so I had no way of opening the case
up so yeah I got the case out already to
build and I spent about 20 minutes of
time that I did not have looking for a
key that I did not have so that was a
bit frustrating so I either had the
option of bailing on this case I'm not
using at all
I didn't have another case to you so
that was the reason why I persevered
with this one in the end I shoved a
screwdriver in there turned it made a
couple of crunching noises nothing to do
with the glass thankfully and it opened
up and now I can turn it I can open and
close it quite easily with a screwdriver
and it does stay in place so yeah not
great for security if you were intending
on using the locking mechanism for
security purposes basically it's just to
stop really these panels pop open if I
can get my hand under there so they've
got quite strong magnets so that's nice
so that should that grabs it like that
so they work very well the magnets are
very strong I just saw they're quite
hard to pull open so they don't swing
open easily that's good but if you do
tilt the case or move it or you're
carrying it you don't want such a heavy
case with the doors flying open while
you're trying to carry it so you can
lock them but yeah as far as security
purposes go anyone with a small
screwdriver can just break them with
it's very little strength is required so
not great for security but good for
holding the doors in place and that
being the case I'd rather you didn't
have a key because
even if I had the keys and I owned this
case I don't want to be rooting around
for 20 minutes every time I've locked
the door I need to find the keys because
you know you're never gonna find those
things whenever you need them so if that
was just a little screwdriver thing that
would be kind of cool
so maybe ditch the keys and make it a
little screwdriver thing finally the
last spot of bother are the feet those
bloody sticks they just make a complete
mess of your desk the black mark so
they're easy enough to wipe away but
every time you put the case down a
movement it leaves some black well four
black circles on your desk it was pretty
funny after I'd finished the actual
build it looked like I'd hosted an RC
car burnout competition on my desk a
disappointingly I hadn't but yeah there
was a lot of black rounder circles and
skid marks and things everywhere so
those are all the annoying and somewhat
disappointing aspects of the level
twenty GT and my particular build
everything else though went really
smoothly the Wraiths Ripper
that's really nice cooler extremely easy
to install and remove so that's nice so
anyone that gets that you won't have any
problems there's just this full of screw
holes on the top so for such a massive
cooler really is extremely quick and
easy to install installing the tr4 see
people stalling CPUs and the tr4 socket
rather that's not that straightforward
but if you haven't done it before it's
probably a bit nerve-wracking especially
with an $1,800 u.s. CPU I made a joke on
Twitter about that but once you've done
it a few times it's really quite simple
as for thermals on the Wraith Reaper I
can't disclose anything at least with
the 2990 WX at the moment because the
ladies under NDA but that'll all be
included in tomorrow's video the MSI X
399 creation obviously looks great you
probably can't see it that well I won't
open the door now but yeah that looks
absolutely fantastic in there with the
Wraith Ripper on it and of course that
board has just an absolutely massive
verum so you can see it on this second
board I have here that I'm about to go
do some very informal temperature
testing with so that will be fun and
that'll be some content you'll see
probably later on the week there's the
big heat sink that cools down the vrm
and then the plastic shroud that goes
over that in the i/o but anyway no need
to get into that right now
now speaking of the VRM
on the crashing Motherwell quite a few
of you have asked me if it's a real 16
phase of e Corvair M and yes it is well
it's an eight phase-- vrm but there are
double as creating 16 phases
I created this block diagram that better
illustrates the design of the vrm but
you know go into more detail about that
in a future content piece MSI say it
should have no trouble delivering 720
watts and I'll dive into again the
thermal performance of the vrm when it's
under quite a lot of load can't specify
how much just yet but quite a lot alone
and I'll also compare it to flagship
boards from as Rock a Seuss and gigabyte
well that's really all I have time for
this probably wasn't that quick I do to
rattle on a bit there as I tend to do
when I do these builds but anyway I hope
you guys enjoyed the build sequence stay
tuned because tomorrow you are getting
hit with the mother of all CPU review so
hopefully you enjoy that and thanks for
watching
I'm your host Dave say again next time
cameras really too far away for that
snake anyway</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
