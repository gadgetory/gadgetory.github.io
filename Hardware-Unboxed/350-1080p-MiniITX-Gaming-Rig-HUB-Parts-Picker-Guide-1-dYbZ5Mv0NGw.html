focused on budget 1080p gaming the
budget have been set at 350 us which
works out to be around 500 Aussie this
is a very tight budget for a new PC that
includes a case and all the bits in it
so don't expect anything crazy but I
will make some upgradation to take this
thing to the next level as a fun little
twist instead of going for a more
typical micro ATX build we're gonna try
and make a compact mini ITX gaming room
for the cpu the intel celeron g90 300
has been selected at this price it's
pretty hard to beat a dual-core sky
processor in fact the reason we're going
this way is to secure LGA 1151 support
on the chetan this provides a rich
upgrade path to current and next
generation core processors in the short
term the G 9300 will be sufficient for
playing games such as rocket League an
overwatch for example still if you have
an extra 80 bucks you can throw out the
build then the 3.7 gigahertz core i3
6100 is a massive step up in my own i3
test rig the lower clock 6100 T is used
and it works a treat since we went with
a skylight processor a supporting
motherboard will be required the
cheapest option is aboard using the
Intel H 110 chip set the asrock h 110 M
HDS jumped out at me it's cheap and a
mini ITX board so win-win there you
could go with a larger micro ATX model
but I thought it would be cool to try
and build a cheap compact PC for land
parties
this is a basic motherboard as you might
imagine given the price still you get 4
USB 3 ports 4 side of 6 gigabit per
second ports decent audio and
dual-channel ddr2 NT 133 support all in
a neat little package occupying one of
the two memory dims will be G skillz NT
series for gigabyte ddr4 2400 memory
this stuff is dirt cheap if you want a
gigabytes of memory and dual channel
operations simply grab another stick for
storage we're going with 1 terabyte hard
drive right now I liked it to Schieber
p300 it delivers slightly better
performance than the WD blue 1 terabyte
for the same price you could also throw
in an SSD boot drive 120 gigabyte models
started around $40 and will make a world
of difference for more information on
the best value SSDs by
right now check out this video here by
far the single most expensive component
is the graphics card for this build we
suggest the newly released Radeon rx4 62
gigabyte model avoid the 4 gigabyte
versions for now as they aren't worth
the 20 to 30% price premium you can
check out my 2 gigabyte vs. 4 gigabyte
comparison video here there are cheaper
options but for the 1080p gaming this is
where I recommend you start since we're
going with a mini ITX build the cooler
Master Elite 110 seemed like the most
suitable choice it's a bit more
expensive than your budget micro ATX
cases but the build quality is excellent
and this thing is tiny and while still
being big enough to fit all that
hardware inside powering the system is
the ultra affordable EVGA 431 80 plus
power supplier power consumption is
still going to be less than trying to
once on a full load for this system so
the strain on the PSU is going to be
minimal still this 431 model would
definitely have you covered even if you
opted for a more powerful GPU and CPU
combo this EVGA power spider doesn't
appear to be available down under so my
fellow Aussies be better off with the
thermaltake TR 2's 450 watt which is
also an exceptional buy overall this
would be a great little PC capable of
delivering very playable performance in
many of the latest titles to ensure
nothing will slow you down consider
spending a bit more to get the core i3
6100 and perhaps adding a second stick
of memory doing so you'll essentially
have created something that's equal to
or even faster than the test system I
use to review the rx 460 here I hope you
guys enjoyed this quick little build
video if you'd like to see more covering
very price ranges please let me know in
