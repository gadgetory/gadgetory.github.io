series video and again we will be
looking at GPUs having just recently
giving you my top 5 worst picks it's
time for some quality options there were
a few ways I could have gone about this
video and I've decided that I will do it
in two separate videos this version will
be a bit more serious that's actual
consumer advice based on benchmarking
that I've done this year I'll be giving
you my top choice in one of five
categories and there will be price range
of study from 100 US or less right up to
$500 u.s. now this kind of thing is a
bit messy right now a little bit tricky
now I wasn't exactly sure how I could
tackle it as you no doubt aware GPU
pricing is just all over the place right
now particularly for the AMD models but
I didn't want to just recommend in video
because they're not being as heavily
impacted by the cryptocurrency mining
not just mining but also global memory
shortages are becoming a problem and
they're causing an uptick in graphics
card pricing and this is starting to
impact Nvidia graphics cards in fact the
cost of Nvidia based graphics cards is
also expected to rise and we should see
a continual rise till the end of the
year so with all that in mind I will be
basing my picks on the current retail
pricing but I'll also be discussing
choices assuming that they these GPUs
were selling at the MSRP that's that
manufacturer's suggested retail price
and they're the prices consumers can
expect to find under normal conditions
so that is to say when miners aren't
snapping up all the graphics cards left
right and center
sorry first we have the best value
entry-level GPU and this one is pretty
easy because just a few weeks ago I
compared the GeForce GT 1030 and Radio
rx 550 in a range of games for the most
part the 1030 was the faster of the two
it consumes slightly less power it does
overclock a little bit better and it is
of course more affordable it's pretty
much a slam-dunk II for in video the
only real hiccup being adaptive sync
technology and that is if you have a
free sync monitoring plan on getting one
in the rx 550 is probably going to be
the better buy to certainly keep that in
mind
sure that though the GT 1030 seems like
a no-brainer to me
the 1030 can also be easily had it for
the $70 MSRP while the rx 550 is usually
around $10 more than its $80 MSRP and
that makes it about 30% more costly
right now even so if both GPUs or at
least the RS 550 was selling at the MSRP
for me I think the GT 1030 would still
be my number one choice
for those of you with more than $100 to
spend but aren't comfortable going over
$200 there are quite a few options
available there is the GeForce GTX 1050
1050 Ti radio rx 560 and the rx 570 the
rx 560 and GTX 1050 are meant to cost
$100 u.s. and at that price it really
could go either way there much of a
muchness
that is to say very similar in terms of
performance right now though they are
both overpriced about 20 to 30 dollars
which is interesting as the GTX 1050 Ti
is just ten dollars over the MSRP and
$150 it's actually the better value
option right now in my opinion it was
previously a bad Buy in comparison to
those two GPS but with pricing the way
they are the 1050 Ti looks pretty good
adding to that I would normally up for
the radar rx 517 this price range at the
MSRP which is 170 dollars u.s. it's
really the best buy but sadly with
availability the way it is and the way
these things are selling two hundred and
sixty dollars u.s. is the current asking
price so while the rx 570 would be my
number one choice typically that is to
say during non boom times right now I
would snap up the GTX 1050 TI without
hesitation
gamer's looking to spend between 200 and
$300 u.s. they do also have a few
options though there are only three GPU
choices technically - but anyway the
GeForce GTX 1060 which is available it
with either three gigabytes or six Q
bytes of memory that is technically two
different GPUs as the three gigabyte
version is slightly cut down then we
have the rx 580 which can be configured
with either 4 gigabytes or eight
gigabytes of memory but both are these
same rx 580 GPU the three gigabyte GTX
1060 in my opinion is really it is a
good value option not gets hated on a
lot but I've still got one and four
1080p gaming it works really well I
haven't noticed any texture problems or
certainly no performance issues and
right now it is selling for two hundred
and ten dollars u.s. now that price it's
very affordable compared to the six
gigabyte model believe the six gigabyte
miles that ending up more towards $280
u.s.
so that means while the three gigabyte
model is only ten dollars above the MSRP
the six gear bike version is $30 above
and that's pretty much down to the fact
that it is the more desirable option for
not just gamers but also miners and of
course the increased memory pricing then
we have that now very elusive rx 580
which should cost just two hundred
dollars for the four gigabyte version or
$230 for the eight gigabyte model so the
MSRP I would get the rx 588 gigabyte
every day of the week but sadly right
now you can expect to pay considerably
more it's something like an eye-watering
three hundred and ten dollars which
means it's really just a complete
write-off
unfortunately so with that being the
case my pics probably going to shock a
few people and possibly even upset some
but I'm gonna go with the three gigabyte
version of the GTX 1060 given the
current retail pricing should pricing
calm down and return to the MSRP so sort
of the normal pricing that I would again
take the RX 588 gigabyte
have you ever around $400 suspend your
choices are very limited though they are
less limited than they were a few months
ago or at least they should be
along with the geforce gtx 1070 there is
now a second GPU that's been slapped
with a $400 MSRP and that is of course
AMD's Radeon rx Vega 56 and I know I
know
availability pricing it's a bit bad
right now so it's not technically a $400
GPU but hopefully one day it will be at
the time of research in this video the
gtx 1070 it was priced around $420 us
which isn't too bad
meanwhile the cheapest Vega 56 card was
selling for at five hundred and twenty
dollars us which is kind of bad so
obviously at those prices you'd have to
go with the gtx 1070 that said though
here in the land down under you can buy
vega 56 for six hundred and thirty
dollars aussie that's actually not too
bad because the gtx 1070 they typically
cost around $600 still though paying
more for vega 56 right now just really
isn't ideal for a few reasons
i'd say firstly which is the fact that
really only reference cards are
available at this point
AMD's stock cooler is pretty rubbish to
be honest secondly I know you guys any
upset when I say this but Vega really
isn't that efficient you can't improve
the situation by under vaulting but that
really only gets you so far and when you
sit it next to something like the gtx
1070 it just pales in comparison when it
comes to efficiency having said that
though for the most part vega 56 is
typically faster and i'm a certain
condition is a lot faster at the
low-level api performance in particular
is very encouraging so for me if the gtx
1070 and vega 56 GPUs were selling at
the $400 MSRP or close enough to I'd
probably get the radeon GPU
however at current prices the gtx 1070
is certainly the smarter choice
finally the last battle can be seen at
$500 or at least it should be looking at
the MSRP s we have the GTX 1080 and rx
Vega 64 GPUs at that price picking
between the two would be tough I'd say I
think once we get custom Vega 64
graphics cards you really could go
either way on that one however right now
we only have those shoddy reference
cards and to be clear when I say that
the PCB designer the components used by
AMD they're all perfectly fine it's
really the blower style air cooler
that's complete and utter trash unless
of course that is you have a 20 meter
display cable in your house your PC in a
separate room and then the reference
cooler isn't too bad
short of that though you're probably
going to need some impressive earplugs
to help you avoid any throttling issues
so for now the GeForce GTX 1080 is the
best option here at least in my opinion
and there are a few decent options for
around 532 $560 us I don't recommend you
spend much more than that I certainly
wouldn't go over $600 for example for
more premium 1080 models and that's
because the 1080i does offer
considerably more performance and base
model starters around 750 dollars u.s.
well I hope that helps out any of you
unfortunate if to be trying to purchase
a new graphics card in this current
climate really comes down to pricing so
make sure you compare the options in
your region typically speaking aim D and
NVIDIA are super competitive I'm pricing
at least by looking at the MSRP s well
that's gonna do it for this one if you
liked this video then you know what to
do your your a smartlock speaking of
which if I got anything wrong in this
video if you disagree with any eye picks
then be sure to let me know about it in
the comments below it probably goes
without saying but do let me know and
also let me know what your top five GPU
list from the last few years looks like
then I can steal that and make another
video it's pretty easy gig this I'm your
host Steve I'll see you again next time
when I present your work as my own</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
