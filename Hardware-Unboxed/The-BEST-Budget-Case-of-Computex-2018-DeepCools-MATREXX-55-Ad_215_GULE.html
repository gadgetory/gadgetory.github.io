video a big thank you to our sponsors
for supporting this year's Computex
coverage check out course has fancy new
vengeance RGB memory and if you're after
a new rig that won't send you broke
MSI's got you covered
check out the latest msi gaming pc
setups and learn how you can build an
incredible new gaming rig that's light
on your wallet make sure you check out
the link below in the video description
welcome back to Hardware unboxed I've
just been walking around the showroom
floor and I've come across the deep cool
booth and there are a couple of really
nice-looking new cases here one that is
particularly affordable some tempered
glass bit of RGB so that is definitely
worth checking out and there are a
couple of new all-in-one the liquid
coolers all right I'm gonna crouch and a
little bit awkwardly here but I do want
to show you the new captain 240 Pro this
is going to be released in August of
this year and it will be a hundred and
twenty dollars u.s. so they've added RGB
to the top of the pump housing here you
get two fans on this 240 millimeter
radiator they have left the pipe that
goes from the pump into the the top of
the block the sort of reservoir section
they've left that as a red so it doesn't
really fit in that well with the RGB so
I'm interested in what you guys think
about that I should also mention the
automatic pressure adjustment function
that's been stalled in the bottom of the
radiator it's able to adjust the
pressure inside the liquid cooler which
helps prevent leaks and therefore extend
the life of the unit the radiator also
features a dual chamber design which
sees the liquid flow in a single
direction and this allows for more
efficient circulation then for the fancy
RG B's this time they are addressable
for synchronized system lighting control
either by the motherboard or the
provided controller and while I'm are
crouched down here a little bit
awkwardly I also show you the new castle
series the castle RGB all in one liquid
coolers they've got a slightly larger
block here it's a very interesting
design it looks quite eye catching and
this will be available in 240 or 280
millimeter versions and they will be
available later next month the pump and
block housing sports dual window panes
and this provides an incredibly unique
look when lit up using the RGB lighting
it comes with five built-in effects and
36 interchangeable lighting modes but
again you can't
Crenn eyes the RGB lighting using an
addressable RGB header on your
motherboard out-of-the-box the castle
series can be installed on all the
latest platforms including thready
rivers massive tr4 socket so a great
looking all-in-one liquid cooler that
I'm keen to include and a build soon all
right so what I think is the main star
of the show here is the matrix 55
compact ATX case despite its small size
it will house extended ATX motherboards
and it's 210 millimeters wide so there
is plenty of headroom there if you do
want to put a large air cooler in
alternatively it is possible to mount a
240 or 280 millimeter radiator in the
top along with a 280 or 360 millimeter
radiator in the front the case also
measures 439 millimeters long and stands
480 millimeters tall giving a volume of
roughly 44 litres inside you can install
three two and a half inch drives and two
three and a half inch drives so quite
good on storage there given its size oh
and if you were wondering the matrix 55
can also accommodate graphics cards as
long as three hundred and seventy
millimeters and motherboards as wide as
three hundred and thirty millimeters
then for $60 u.s. there's the Matrix 70
and this model is the exact same length
as the lower end Matrix 55 it's 10
millimeters skinnier though but 29
millimeters tall so the volume remains
much the same because the case is taller
it actually extends the top mounting
radiator location and now you can
install a three hundred and sixty
millimeter rad so a three hundred and
sixty millimeter radio on the top along
with one in the front as well other than
that they are quite similar and storage
support also remains the same there is
one more model in the Matrix series
though and it's bigger again so let's
take a look at that here we have the
flagship matrix case the matrix 75 and
this is obviously the biggest case in
the Matrix series but one cool thing
about this one is you'll notice that it
has this nice glass panel in the front
that gives you that really clean look
but it does a limit airflow I know a lot
of you guys like a maximum airflow and
for those of you that don't really care
that much about the cases appearance
deep cool has included an extra front
panel is a button here you push that and
it pops out and included in the bundle
is a mesh panel as well so you can
maximize your airflow there with that so
that is a really nice touch there by
deep cool
the metric 75 is also the same length as
the lower end models but it's a little
beefier with a width of 220 millimeters
and a height of 500 and 10 millimeters
taking the capacity up to almost 50
liters for this model you can fit a 360
millimeter radio in the top and front
well it is also possible to store a 240
millimeter radiator in the bottom of the
case when using a short power supply
I imagine power suppliers around 140
millimeter mark the storage support has
also been upgraded to handle for two and
a half inch drives though the three and
a half inch support does remain at just
2 the flagship Matrix 75 model is
suggested to come in at $90 u.s. so some
really nice-looking coolers from deep
cool and I really like the new matrix
series some really great value cases
they're so keen to check those out
hopefully we can see them in unboxing
boxes in the not-too-distant future and
as always thanks for watching I'll see
you guys again next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
