corner normally this is Tim's segment
but he is out this week reckons he's got
a bit of a stomach bug I reckon probably
not enough megamix for the young fella
anyway I've stepped up to the plate to
deliver you guys some news so let's see
what's in there headlines this week okay
what have we got here
gtx 1180 rumor checks 1180 rumor more
gtx 1180 news GTX 20 no that's the same
thing an ad 1180 gtx 1180 a release date
gtx 1180 specs and yet more gtx 1180
rumens okay well rumors aside there does
appear that there's actually very little
news to report on this week so that's
going to make my job a little bit easier
I mean I do have like three benchmark
videos in the works but let's find him
yet better mate right so for the past
month we beginning slammed with pretty
much nothing but gtx 1180 rumors and
with the focus on what nvidia does next
AMD has seen a little attention that's
said in the last few weeks the rumors
have started to bubble over and many
have begun to suspect that the next
generation of Radeon GPUs are just
around the corner and this has all been
sparked by the apparent sell-off of Vega
56 and 64 stock and many of the models
are now showing up as discontinued
personally though I have to say at this
point I wasn't really expecting to see
any new AMD GPUs this year and none of
our contacts have mentioned anything and
they all seem to be pretty convinced
that nothing is happening this year and
that now looks to me the cases as rocks
shared some slides at the X fast Network
event in Taipei detailing its graphics
card strategy up till February of 2019
the slides also revealed that as ROC
plans to release a new mk2 series in
August based on the RX v 7t and rx 580
GPUs this new series will almost
certainly feature improved cooling as
the standard phantom gaming series is
fairly underwhelming when it comes to
cooling so that being the case is
extremely unlikely that asrock would
announce upcoming RX v 7t and rx 580
graphics cards in August if anybody had
any plans of releasing new GP
this year now looks highly likely that
we'll see new AMD GPUs about six months
later in March of 2019 now you might
have heard a story earlier this week
about Intel killing off the extreme
edition CPU family and this story hit
headlines when a former Intel engineer
tweeted out the following the extreme
edition brand is about to get killed
what a big mistake that tweet though may
have been a mistake and Intel spokesmen
set the record straight the very next
day giving the following statement -
tech report there is no change to the
branding of the Intel Core Extreme
Edition processor and Intel Core
x-series processor family so that's that
for now sounds like if you want to pay
way too much for a desktop CPU you still
can no new GPU news from Nvidia but the
company has developed an impressive deep
learning technique capable of
automatically removing noise and
artifacts from photos whereas recent
deep learning work in this field has
focused on training neural networks with
clean and noisy images invidious AI can
do so without ever being shown a noise
free example the new deep learning based
approach developed alongside researchers
from MIT and Aalto University can remove
noise artifacts and grain after only
seeing two dirty samples using Tesla P
100 GPUs and video training the system
on 50,000 images in the image net
validation set it then validated the
neural network on three different data
sets the results are rather impressive a
special and images corrupted with random
text and photos with excessive noise but
as is to be expected there is some loss
of sharpness when using invidious AI but
still overall very impressive stuff
Samsung has just put its fifth
generation v-nand memory into mass
production so that means even faster
solar set drives are on the horizon this
next generation v9 technology offers
better performance and higher yields of
usable chips through improvements in
manufacturing using over 90 layers
compared to the previous generation 64
the new memory achieves nearly a 40%
improvement in performance and will
arrive in 32 gigabyte chip capacities
each chip can reach speeds of up to 1.4
gigabits per second and despite having
more layers the chips are not all that
much thicker as they nearly 20 percent
reduction in layer thickness has been a
achieved energy efficiency remains
roughly the same since Samsung has been
able to run its newest generation just
1.2 volts instead of 1.8 volts for the
previous generations right speeds have
also been improved by up to 30% and
Samsung has bragged that it's fifth gen
v-nand can achieve the highest peak
right speeds on the market with bits of
data being stored in as little as 500
microseconds
even though manufacturing processes have
become extremely expensive for
semiconductor components samsung claims
productivity is up over 30% so faster
storage may not be more expensive than
current generation products big news for
gamers this week CD Projekt RED says
there will be a new witcha game but it
won't be called The Witcher for the
developer stated the first three tiles
made up a solid trilogy so any new entry
won't be called The Witcher 4 they did
go on to say though this doesn't mean
they'll leave The Witcher world behind
right now most of the gaming world has
its eyes on CD Projekt RED cyberpunk
2077 as the behind closed doors III demo
was in pre-alpha state it could be years
before the game arrives though
surprisingly the studio is working on
another title at the same time and
that's rumored to launch in 2021 though
no details have been revealed at this
time having sold over 33 million copies
you can understand why CD Projekt RED
doesn't want to abandon the witcher
series but it's a shame we went out of
play as jail anymore fortnight's 5th
season has officially arrived and with
it comes a host of new features map
modifications and cosmetic goodies set
in motion by last week's one time rocket
event fortnight now includes in-game
riffs these are small blue shimmers
scattered around the map hop in one of
them and you'll suddenly drop out of the
sky in a different location they're
probably going to be quite useful for
sneaking up on the enemy season 5 also
adds a new vehicle in addition to the
shopping cart and the new vehicle is the
all-terrain car nor 80k for short this
tricked-out golf cart has room for your
entire squads that's quite nice moving
all four of you around the map quite
quickly and as a fun little bonus the
roof also acts as a bounce pad map
updates include a new desert biome
complete with a racetrack and two new
locations Paradise Palms and lazy Lynx
as for the cosmetic stuff well there's
an all-new battle
featuring 100 tiers of items to unlock
this season includes toys and props that
can be used to play the games like
basketball and golf with your friends as
well as usual stuff like outfits and
whatnot as was the case previously the
Battle Pass will set you back nine
hundred and fifty bucks or around ten
dollars US Apple has finally faced
criticism for its lack of processor
updates on the MacBook Pro line despite
most of the Windows PC competitors
upgrading their respective models Apple
has failed to do so that is until now
Apple has also had to deal with the
keyboard reliability issues with the
butterfly switches and these issues have
no doubt kept many would-be Apple
customers from purchasing a new MacBook
Pro however Apple is finally dealing
with one of those issues with its update
of the 13 and 15 inch MacBook Pro with
touch bar the 15 inch version gets the
Intel 6 core 12 thread process
disappointing clock speeds up to 4.8
gigahertz
they can be configured with as much as
32 gigabytes of ddr4 memory and the GPUs
are of course discrete AMD Radeon pros
with 4 gigabytes of vram then for
storage the 50 inch model can handle up
to 4 terabytes pricing starts at 2400
dollars u.s. but can be as much as six
thousand seven hundred dollars u.s. if
you go all-out the 13-inch model gets
quad core Core i5 and i7 chips with
turbos up to 4.5 gigahertz those CPUs
are paired with integrated Intel
graphics and pricing starts at $1,800
u.s. Apple says that the keyboards in
the 2000 update contain third-generation
butterfly switches there's no indication
these were engineered to be more durable
but they are quieter of course Apple
insists that the keyboard reliability
issues only affected a small amount of
MacBook Pro users oh and just quickly to
round out the Apple news on July 7th the
Apple Store in Fresno California was
robbed of $27,000 u.s. worth of
merchandise the store which sits in the
middle of the always busy fashion Fair
Mall was open and serving customers at
the time the incident is still under
investigation but police have just
released footage of the crime on Tuesday
and are asking for help the surveillance
footage of the crime shows four
individuals entering the store in
quickly removing MacBooks iPods iPhones
iPads from their displays the crooks
were not violent but they were
aggressive as they push people out of
the way to get to the devices the entire
crime took less than 30 seconds google
recently enabled a new security feature
as part of chrome 67 that aims to
mitigate speculative execution
side-channel attacks like spectra it's
good news for security but as we've seen
with other fixes it will cost you in
terms of system resources in short
you're looking at around a 10 to 13
percent increase in system memory usage
so for those of you with 16 gigabytes or
more system memory this probably won't
be an issue but for budget rigs with 8
gigabytes or less there will likely be a
noticeable performance hit as I was
putting this video together I had over a
dozen tabs open and chrome 67 was
hogging four and a half gigabytes of my
editing systems 32 gigabyte memory
buffer if Google's estimates are correct
the previous version would have chewed
up around 4 gigabytes so again for
hiring rigs like mine probably not a big
deal
but it could be a problem for budget
systems on a positive note though with
time the Google team should be able to
optimize the security feature in future
versions and that is going to do it for
this week's news corner hopefully we'll
have Tim back next week but he's got the
next few days off anyway to recover
tomorrow I have a spectra variant for
benchmark that looks at the impact
addressing these speculative store
bypass vulnerability has on Intel's
coffee-like CPUs and then on Sunday a
quick look at how the Rison 520 600 and
risin 7 and 20 700 series stack up in
games so be sure to keep an eye out for
all that content I'm your host Steve and
I'll catch you again soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
