the one you've been waiting for the
showdown between Intel's Core i7 700 X
and AMD's risin 5 - 1600 we've seen how
they compare for productivity workloads
but if you like to game as well
does Intel still take the cake when it
comes to high-end gaming so just quickly
what do you need to know before we jump
into the benchmarks well about the CPUs
themselves the 1700 X currently costs
four hundred and fifteen dollars u.s.
but has an MSRP of three hundred ninety
dollars
meanwhile the 1600 currently retails for
just two hundred and fifteen dollars so
almost half the price and while that's
worth keeping in mind as we proceed
AMD's a m4 platform also cost
significantly less than Intel LGA 2066
but I'll touch on that a bit more later
for testing we have 30 games in total
all of which have been tested at 1080p
using the gtx 1080i and no i'm not going
to test at 1440p or 4k you'll have to
look elsewhere for those results I'm not
really interested in testing gaming
performance of CPUs under GPU limited
scenarios so moving on
both systems were configured with ddr4
3200 CL 14 memory though whereas the
Reisman system only gets 16 gigabytes
the Intel system gets 32 gigabytes this
shouldn't impact the results in any way
but the reason I've done this is quite
simple I don't have a 32 gigabyte kit
yet that works with Rison at the 3200
memory speed alright so into the
benchmarks and first that we have World
of Tanks and this isn't a particularly
demanding title but the idea here is to
include a wide range of games so not all
of them will be CPU demanding be aware
this game is captain 120 FPS and while
it is possible to circumvent that cap
it's not something most people are going
to do so I haven't bothered to do it
myself anyway here we see the Rison v
1600 had no trouble pushing the gtx
1080i to the frame cap and it was even a
few frames faster than the 7800 X which
is worth noting Grand Theft Auto 5 is a
game that never really played that well
with rising CPUs it is an older title
from 2015 and therefore does predate
Rison by quite a few years anyway
despite its age the game is still very
demanding that makes good use of all
system resources what's interesting to
note here is that the overclocked r5
1600 was just 6% slower than 700 X and
that's pretty impressive given its also
clocked 15% lower it's also a massive
improvement over the 20% margin at the
rise in CPU travel to the 7700 K by
previously I had benchmarked player
unknowns battlegrounds at the start of
the game you know that area where
everyone runs around in invincibility
mode waiting for the game to start I
feel like this was probably a mistake
for a few reasons firstly it is
extremely difficult to gather reliable
data here and secondly it's
significantly more demanding than the
actual gameplay itself you're never
going to find everyone in a small area
of the map when playing so that makes
that benchmark a little bit unrealistic
anyway I'm now testing within the actual
game so that is dropping in to the main
map and then starting at the same
location each time from there I do
follow the same path 60 seconds and the
data seen in the graph is an average of
three runs as you can see the r5 1600
performs very well in this title again
please note this game is frame capped at
144 FPS and I'm not sure if there's a
workaround to remove it that's
relatively easy or not I didn't come
across that information that said the
144 FPS
is plenty I can't imagine many players
will be able to take advantage of more
in this title although the game is frame
cap to the r5 1600 was consistently
faster than the 700 X by a small margin
delivering around 7% more frames when
looking at the minimums The Witcher 3
Wild Hunt plays well on both the 7800 X
and r5 1600 that said the Intel CPU was
faster the game isn't frame capped so if
the GTX 1080 I could deliver over 200
FPS using the ultra quality settings we
would likely see that with a CPU such as
the 7700 K anyway the r5 1600 was 15%
slower than the 1700 X out of the box so
it's a fairly decent margin however once
both CPUs are overclocked that margin is
reduced to the 6% so while still slower
an impressive result nonetheless for the
rise in CPU again we see this time when
testing with rise of the Tomb Raider the
r5 1600 is 12% slow in the semi area
I'm looking at the average frame rate
this time since the minimums are
identical however once overclock the r5
1600 was just one and a half percent
slower on average but twelve percent
faster for the minimum so it's a very
interesting result indeed again these
figures are based on a three run average
and the rise in CPU was consistently
faster for the minimum I have continued
to test ashes of the singularity
escalation using the crazy preset which
pretty much runs into a GPU limited
scenario with the Intel CPUs that said
the same isn't true for the Rison 5 or
1600 which I found quite surprising here
it struggled to get the most out of the
GTX 10 atti
overclocking certainly helped but it was
still a little bit off the pace one or
two frames down from maxing out the
GeForce graphics card the hakurei primal
is a bit of a funny game that was one of
the few titles that really baffled me
when testing Rison for the first time
all those months ago the performance was
just so much lower than expected when
compared to the 77 ok
and yet we found the exact same thing
when testing the semi 100x more recently
in fact the 7800 x and r5 1600 do
deliver very similar numbers in this
title and I'd say overall the
performance was decent frame rates never
did below 60 fps so a very smooth
experience at all times the division is
a GPU limited title and while the r5
6100 is slightly down on the 700 X and
7700 K so the average frame rate it does
roughly match the minimum result and it
well over 100 FPS you have to wonder if
the margins even matter at this point
they certainly don't if you plan on
running a graphics card equal to slower
than say a geforce gtx 1070 hitman is a
game that features a huge number of npcs
and this can be quite taxing on the cpu
and we've certainly seen that in the
past with this title this is another
title where the semi 100x fell quite a
way behind the 77 or okay and the same
is also true for the r5 1600 that said
whereas the 1600 was 15% slower than
semadar x at the stop cloth speeds
overclocking both processors reduce the
margin to 0 as both allowed for no less
than 61 FPS to be rendered I have to
admit I do have a confession to make
I completely botch the quantum break
benchmark results in the previous 7800 X
versus 7700 ok video so sorry about that
I'm not
sure what went wrong but for some reason
I seem to be frame capped at around
fifty to fifty three fps I wasn't
testing with vsync enabled or anything
like that in order to fix the issue I
had to actually delete all the config
files and start over something I should
have noticed and picked up on but I
didn't so again sorry about that a bit
of a strange bug there but anyway the
results are now fixed and I have
triple-checked everything
here we see that at the stop clock
speeds the minimum frame rate for the r5
1600 is down on the seminar X by about a
13% margin however as we've seen your
mist is already overclocked in the 1600
really helps it close the margin and now
it's just 4% slower moving on for
testing overwatch I used my standard
match test which is very CPU intensive
despite that the horizon 5 1600 stood up
very well and even edged ahead of the
700 X once both CPUs were overclocked so
a great result for the plucky little
Verizon 5 CPU here Doom has an obvious
200 FPS cap and unlike the semi 100x the
r5 1600 had no trouble reaching it at
the stop clock speeds not much else to
really say here so let's move on to
total war Warhammer and this is a game
I've tested out of interest sake using
both DirectX 12 and DirectX 11 the focus
will be on the more modern DX 12 API but
as I said the DirectX 11 results have
also have included purely out of
interest sake here the r5 1600 easily
beats the similar X and when overclocked
the minimum frame rate was 16% greater
the horizon CPU did still trail the 7700
K by a decent margin here and Intel's
quad-core proves to be quite the beast
in this game using the older dx11 api
the r5 1600 is now 22% fast and the 7800
X once overclocked the margin has opened
up thanks to the GTX 1080p eyes ability
to render more frames when using DirectX
11 out of the box the Rison processor
gets a little trampled Mirror's Edge
catalyst as it was a rather massive 22
percent slower than the semi 100x
when containing the minimum frame rate
yet once overclocked to 1600 did reduce
the margin to just 7% and again with
well over 100 FPS in fact 120 FPS at all
times you have to wonder how important
these margins really are nonetheless
this is a win for the Blue Man Group
let's move on to see what f1 2016 has
for us here the r5 1600 was 19% slower
than the 7800 X when comparing the
out-of-the-box performance that's a
pretty big win for Intel but yet again
we find that AMD is able to make up some
serious ground through overclocking at 4
gigahertz the 6100 is now just 6% slower
than the 7x which is of course clocked
at 4.7 gigahertz jumping back into
another DirectX 12 title we have Deus Ex
mankind divided and this is a rather
poor one for Rison at least when paired
with the GeForce graphics card something
about the way the Nvidia drivers handled
the DX 12 API just doesn't agree with
Rison even once overclocked the r5 1600
was still 19% slow in the servitor X so
this just like I said isn't a great
title for the red team
the performance is hardly poor from an
end users perspective but it's a lot
weaker when compared to the competition
moving on the show what I mean about
Rison doing poorly with the GeForce
graphics card using DirectX 12 is day
use X I already tested using dx11
as you can see a radically different
picture here is the r5 1600 is now able
to match the semi ahead of X in this
title battlefield 1 is probably one of
the more important titles in this list
and here the r5 1600 was able to match
the seven-hour X out of the box we find
much the same ones both CPUs are
overclocked as they allowed the GTX 1080
Ti to spit out no less than a hundred
and 60 fps
so while the 77 era came might be a
little faster the 1600 X is certainly
suitable for 144 Hertz gamers in this
title mafia 3 is a bit of a dodgy title
and I might even end up dropping it soon
depending on how many of you are keen to
see it remain initially arisin looks
great in this title however with each
patch Reisman's performance seemed to go
backwards while intel's improved so I'm
not sure what's up with that upon
initial release Rison was actually
beating the 7700 K in this title at the
stock clock speeds but now it trails by
a 32% margin we're looking at the
minimum frame rate so again I'm not
really sure what's up with that
overclock the 1600 does recover quite a
bit and is now just 7% slower than the
700 X but still those stock clock
results are concerning and I'm a little
suspicious as to what's going on here
anyway marthy 3 is a poorly
title and they will no doubt be some
better built games coming up soon so I
can probably replace it with one of
those gears r44 is another game like
Deus Ex mankind divided but just doesn't
play well with the rise in CPUs when
using a GeForce graphics card this is a
DirectX 12 only title so until AMD
release a high end GPU this is how
things are going to have to be Gears of
War 4 is a reasonably well put together
game though but I personally would love
to drop it because I just hate having to
deal with that rubbish Windows Store
this is the only game I test with from
the Windows Store and unless there's
some incredible game released in the
future it'll probably the last game I
ever buy on this horrid platform
titanfall 2 is a game that plays well on
just about anything and as a result it
doesn't actually provide us with any
interesting data that said though it is
great to see the more affordable rising
6 hanging in there with the more
expensive CPUs in this title moving on
we have Civilization 6 and we're back to
DirectX 12 but this one plays very well
with the rise and slash GeForce combo
and even out of the box the r5 1600 is
able to clean up the core i7 700x
overclock the r5 1600 is now 14% fast
and similar X though it is still 10%
slower than the 7700 K Dishonored 2
provides more interesting results though
they do reflect what we've seen in most
of the titles already tested stop the r5
1600 is 7% slow on the 7th her ex while
quite shockingly it pulled ahead by a 9%
margin once overclocked an incredible
result for the red team here that said
though it does go a bit south frame D
when testing with watchdogs - and this
is a title it's never really been that
kind - the rise and cpus here the r5
1600 was 24% slower at the stock clock
speeds though that rather large margin
is reduced to this 9% once both CPUs are
overclocked please note that previously
the 7700 K and 7800 X were tested in
Resident Evil 7 was a little bit of
upscaling going on for this test I have
adjusted the scaling to 100% and now we
are truly reflecting 1080p performance
for the first time we are seeing the r5
1600 full further behind in the 700 X
once both CPUs are overclocked stop the
rise on CPU is 4% slower while
overclocked it was 6% slower
these aren't huge margins by any means
but it is the first
we've seen this although for honor is
mostly a GPU bound game and we see that
as all three CPUs are able to deliver
around the same average frame rate there
is some variance when looking at the
minimum what's really interesting here
is that the r5 1600 actually beats not
just the 700 X but also the 7700 K when
stock and overclocked this is a very
curious result indeed especially in a
title where the CPU isn't that heavily
taxed Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon wildlands
is another GPU limited game for the most
part the r5 1600 and 700 X still have a
very similar performance and here we see
at the 77 ok isn't a great deal faster
Mass Effect Andromeda is a game that's
played well with Verizon since day one
and has continued to work well thrives
and after numerous updates overclock the
r5 1600 is able to get the most out of
the GTX 1080i and here it matched the
700 X and 7700 K boy oh boy did I waste
a lot of time trying to work out what
the heck was going on with Dawn of War 3
the game was recently patched I believe
it was the 11th of July don't quote me
on that but it was sometime around there
anyway it was sometime this month and
the hotfix
update completely crippled performance
in this title reducing the gtx 980ti to
around 50 FPS so I've had to use a
previous version of the game for this
benchmark because I didn't have the
horizon 5 results obviously so please
don't ask me how I was able to do that
anyway here we set the r5 1600 is able
to match the 700 X and Dawn of War 3 so
some very competitive performance here
indeed and just to touch on the issues
that I talked about at the start the
developers are aware of the issues or
the performance issues of the hotfix
created and they're working on a fixed
so hopefully that comes in the next week
or two moving on we have yet another
game this time pray and this one is a
very well put together title it's not
particularly demanding on the CPU but it
still doesn't hinder CPU performance
either like what we see with the game
such as Far Cry primal for example here
the 7700 case 700 X and r5 1600 all
deliver similar performance especially
once they're all overclocked
finally wrapping things that we have
dirt 4 and this title plays very well on
the rise in v 1600 stock the AMD
processor was able to maintain more
frames in the similar X and once
overclocked
it was just outright faster even
matching the 7700 K for the minimum
frame rate so a stellar result for AMD
here I have to admit this just seems
wrong I still can't get used to seeing
AMD CPUs consuming less power than their
Intel counterparts it feels unnatural
for the longest time those horrible FX
series chipset well on top of the power
charts and I'm so glad we've been how to
move on from that for what seemed like a
similar level of performance and we'll
touch on that at the moment the r5 1600
consumed quite a lot less power when
compared to the 707 the rising
system consumed 15% less power and 18%
less before we didn't you ever clocking
so that's a definite win for AMD right
there who would have predicted this at
the beginning of the year I'll admit it
certainly wouldn't have been me well I
did try to get to the point quite
quickly on this one but at this stage
I've blurted out something like 3,000
words so apologies for that anyway I
hope you like me found the results
really interesting I very much enjoyed
the testing and I'm quite surprised by
how well the Rison v 1600 is getting on
today it's always been good but it seems
like the fine-tuning AMD's done over the
past few months has come together to
make it that much better for gaming I
mean look at this game about to throw up
it's a good stuff I actually ended up
spending an extra two days going over
the results mostly retesting and
comparing the core i7 semi 7rk and Rison
5 1600 because the figures we're looking
at here just seems too close overall out
of the box the r5 1600 was just 13%
slower than the 7700 okay that's quite
incredible keep in mind though there
were a few GPU limited games and even
worse a few that were frame capped but
still they weren't frame cap to 60fps or
anything like that many of them had
frame limits of 120 or some even greater
so the rise in CPU was still pushing the
GTX 1080i very hard once overclocked the
r5 1600 was just 9% solid with 77 ok
while it matched the 7800 X that's right
it matched the $390 us processor ok so
I'm sure you're itching to see what the
overall
looks like so here it is right so what
you're looking at here is the risin 5
1600 versus the core i7 700x comparing
the overclocked results looking at the
minimum frame rates as we just saw both
averaged a minimum of 103 fps across the
30 games tested and here we can clearly
see at the r5 1600 enjoyed some wins and
suffered through a few losses it is
worth noting though that the number of
titles won and lost are very even indeed
and as such there are a few ways you
could adjust the data to give either CPU
a slight edge but let's be honest it
would only be that a very slight edge
for example removing AMD's
worst-performing title Gears of War for
the r5 1600 will become just 1% fast in
the 700 X and that's a negligible
difference remove the second-worst
titled a sex mankind divided using
DirectX 12 and the r5 1600 is still just
1% faster and that's the beauty of
testing with such a massive sample of
games also please note that because
there was a very large difference in
performance between running Deus Ex
mankind of vitae with DirectX 11 and
DirectX 12 with the rise in CPU I've
included both the results in this graph
however I've only include the dx12
results for total war Warhammer and not
the dx11 results since the r5 1600 was
much faster in both tests so I favored
the DirectX 12 results as they are based
on the newer API
no doubt some viewers will declare that
I'm biased towards a certain company but
if that were really true I would just
omit certain games from the results I
mean would you guys really complain if I
only tested 20 games how many other
media outlets conduct 20 game benchmarks
using 100% fresh data if I was biased
towards AMD there is no way you would
see Deus Ex mankind divided or Gears of
War 4 in this list meanwhile if our bias
towards Intel I'd drop total war
Warhammer and civilization 6 for example
anyway enough of that I know the vast
majority if you appreciate the lengths I
go to to try and deliver balanced fair
honest content right so if you have to
value for money it's pretty clear the
risin 5 1600 is the way to go
and this is why I recently named at the
best value performance desktop CPU in my
top 5 CPUs video
was unlikely the core i7 semi her ex was
going to change that but I had hoped
that the performance would at least be a
compelling reason to buy Intel's new 6th
core processor this slide that you've
been staring at for the past few moments
really says it all you can spend roughly
twice as much to receive essentially the
same experience and this is true if
you're a gamer or a worker yeah let's
let's go with the workout I'm sure there
are those of you who are chomping at the
bit to point out the 700 X system is
more memory and while you'd be right it
would be possible to save some money
here and get full gigabyte modules but
who invests in a premium platform to
have 16 gigabytes of memory and no less
for four gigabyte modules I've also
selected the very best premium 16
gigabyte kit for the rise in CPU as this
is what I used for testing but be aware
there are cheaper options out there
additionally Rison will hit 4 gigahertz
with the Box cooler but it will be a
more mild experience with a $20.00
aftermarket cooler like the cooler
master 212 so keep that in mind
the 7800 X on the other hand cannot be
overclocked to 4.7 gigahertz using a 240
millimeter all-in-one closed-loop
solution I required a 380 dollar custom
loop setup to achieve that overclock so
also be aware of that wrapping things up
I think it's fair to say that the Rison
5 1600 delivers a very similar
experience to the core i7 700 X and once
overclocked there's really no
distinguishing the 2 when it comes to
gaming it also consumes less power
that's the Rison 5 processor costs
considerably less and it comes with a
smart little box cooler actually it's
not really that little is it
aha anyway there are five 1600 in my
opinion is the obvious choice II and I
can't think of many arguments or reasons
I'd make for buying the 700 X over the
r5 6100 in fact I'd hate to be tasked
with that job you'd have to come up with
something ludicrous like AMD sticking
their CPUs together with glue or
something like that I'm your host Steve
see again soon guys
