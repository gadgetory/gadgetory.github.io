a fair bit of time over the last year or
so exploring the world of external GPUs
in fact just a couple of weeks ago I
published my review of the latest
gigabyte rx5 rated gaming box but this
whole time I've been testing each GPUs
and exploring how they perform I just
can't shake the thought that they just
aren't very good and in most
circumstances don't make a lot of sense
to buy the whole idea behind external
GPS is a good one in theory you can plug
in an external graphics processor to a
system that has a weak GPU and
immediately get gaming grade graphics
performance
this makes AGP you sound like a
fantastic option for those that have an
ultrabook
with integrated graphics or just want a
super portable gaming setup after all
each GPUs are generally quite compact
and designed as an add-on to slim light
systems while this is a great theory and
an idea that I think has a lot of
potential
right now a GPUs don't work like this in
practice there are a bunch of
fundamental flaws to the technologies
that facilitate external graphics and
that makes current generation products
either poor value or just not a good
option over alternatives for PC gaming
almost all the blame goes to Thunderbolt
3 it's a super fast interconnect and
great for attaching high-speed storage
devices high resolution displays and
other peripherals that require fast data
transfer rates but it's just not fast
enough for GPUs Thunderbolt 3 presents
bandwidth and latency limitations that
choke the living daylights out of a
graphics card forming the single largest
bottleneck for any a GPU equipped
system the wayy GPUs work is they
utilize Thunderbolt threes four lanes of
PCI Express 3.0 so the GPU can connect
and operate over familiar protocol a
cursory glance would suggest the maths
checks out to Thunderbolt 3 is a 40
gigabit per second protocol and pcie 3.0
x 4 requires just 31.5 gigabit per
second however this does not take into
account several key differences between
Thunderbolt 3 and Raw PCIe Thunderbolt 3
operates through the chipset so it's not
a direct connection to the CPU like the
standard PCIe lanes used to connect a
GPU in a desktop system on
top of that there is typically an
additional Thunderbolt controller at
both ends of the cable when you factor
in all these additional steps and chips
between the CPU and GPU and the added
protocols of Thunderbolt 3 you don't get
anywhere near 40 gigabit per second of
bandwidth for the GPU the bandwidth left
for the GPU typically sits between 17
and 21 gigabit per second in a
real-world memory copy test compared to
26 gigabit per second for direct to cpu
pcie 3.0 x 4 that's roughly 30% more
bandwidth from a direct connection and
let's not forget that we're talking
about just pcie 3.0 x 4 here not the
full x 16 you'd get from a desktop slot
we know from tech power ups previous
testing that a gtx 1080 running over a
pcie 3.0 x 4 interface will be kept to
about 96 percent of its full time 16
performance so when you can't bandwidth
by a further 25 percent or so next to
Thunderbolt 3 more of that performance
of roads but bandwidth is only one part
of the story the real killer is latency
when you add in the chipset Thunderbolt
3 controllers and the length of the
cable itself there's a massive uptick in
communications latency between the GPU
and other components in a desktop PC the
GPU is physically situated very close to
the CPU and communicates over direct
PCIe lanes that's not the case at all
with EGP is where the GPU connects
through the chipset and data is
transmitted over longer cables the
bandwidth limit but more importantly the
added latency caps any eg PS performance
to rents 70 to 80 percent of what the
GPU inside is actually capable of when
packed into a true gaming desktop or
laptop and it doesn't matter whether the
AGP use the gtx 1060 or gtx 10 atti
any GPU placed into a Thunderbolt 3
enclosure immediately loses about 20% of
its performance in the best-case
scenarios and in the most latency
impacted games like prey the performance
hit is more like 50 percent or greater
and when you start asking Thunderbolt 3
to do more on top of transmitting data
to and from the GPU for example using
the included USB or Ethernet ports on
some EGP enclosures you start running
into issues because there's just not
enough bandwidth you'll either
experience a performance hit and
stuttering in games or the USB port
simply won't work or
cut out at random times and you
especially shouldn't pass a display
signal from the GPU back through the
thunderbolt three cable to your laptop's
built-in display this is a supported
feature of a GPUs but again the lack of
available bandwidth to send the return
display signal leads to a noticeable
performance loss in games this means
that to get the most out of your a GPU
you need to hook up an external monitor
directly to one of the GPUs display
outputs and for those that don't already
have a monitor it's an added cost on top
of the e GPU purchase price as it stands
right now Thunderbolt 3 is just not
suited to external graphics technologies
it imposes far too many restrictions on
bandwidth latency and attached devices
such that it limits the performance and
usability of external GPU enclosures to
make these sorts of enclosures worth the
time money we really need a next-gen
connector technology something like
Thunderbolt 4 with double the bandwidth
and most importantly a significant
latency reduction the next-gen
Thunderbolt is probably a fair way away
but if it can provide an earful PCIe x 8
connection with latency much closer to a
desktop PC a GPUs wouldn't have anywhere
near as high performance penalty and
overall that make much more sense now
you might be wondering what about those
direct PCIe adapters you can buy the
transform an m dot 2 slot or a mini PCIe
slot into a full PCIe x 16 slot running
it for time speeds in this case for its
tone GPUs well these are better in
theory as they provide a more direct
connection but in practice they are not
particularly plugin players you need a
cable dangling out of your exposed
laptop also Steve bought one and
couldn't get it to work with several
different laptops there seems to be a
few compatibility issues there at the
moment the other issue with a GPS is
their price when you factor in the
performance and a GPU delivers relative
to its cost buying an a GPU makes very
little sense for most people compared to
other ways of getting gaming capable
systems let's say you want a system
capable of playing basic games like
fortnight overwatch or csgo and you
don't want to spend a boatload of cash
if you go to the e GPU route you'll need
to spend at least $200 on the enclosure
and then grab a GPU like the GTX 1050
which these days cost around 150 dollars
so
all up the EGP use costing you 350 bucks
and then on top of that you need a
laptop with Thunderbolt 3 and an
external display now when you factor in
the performance penalty of using an e
GPU through Thunderbolt 3 that gtx 1050
is going to fall closer to in videos
popular integrated GPU the MX 150 the e
GPU will probably be around 10 to 20
percent faster but the MX 150 is still
capable of playing games like Fortnight
on medium level quality presets
realistically there's not much point
buying the GTX 1050 EGP you if you have
an MX 150 or greater discrete GPU so
it's only worth buying for those that
are stuck with integrated graphics and
even then you need to already have a
Thunderbolt 3 equipped laptop with that
integrated graphics to consider buying
this a GPU combo if you don't have that
laptop my advice would be to buy a
laptop with a discrete GPU inside either
the MX 150 or preferably a true gtx 1050
Thunderball 3 laptops are already in the
upper end of pricing and there are
plenty of nice thin and light options
with the MX 150 or even up to a GTX 1050
Ti inside it is similar price point if
you want that sort of entry-level to
midtech gaming experience in a portable
form factor there's not much point
buying a laptop plus a GPU when gaming
capable portable laptops already exist
higher-end discrete GPU snake even less
sense if I'm honest take the Auris gtx
1070 gaming box which retails for 600 us
with the Thunderbolt 3 penalty you're
looking at performance around or below
the level of a gtx 1066 gigabyte gaming
laptop considering you already need an
external display to get the best EGP
performance why buy one at all over a
complete and fully upgradable gaming
desktop even on the budget here is a
basic gaming system I made for around
$600 that includes a quad-core Rison 320
200 G CPU a gig of ram and a GTX 1063
gigabyte this PC will perform about as
well as the e GPU hooked up to a laptop
sporting Thunderbolt 3 except it's a
full gaming system the EGP requires a
laptop to function so you'll either need
to already have a compatible laptop or
you'll need to buy one on top of the
$600 asking price for just the EGP you
it's a no-brainer to build the desktop
if you don't already have a compatible
laptop but II
then if you do already have one of the
compatible laptops buying a desktop PC
over Annie GPU gives you much greater
scope for upgrades in the future without
compromising on performance for gaming
right now now of course for some people
that want portability and a compact set
up a full gaming desktop isn't going to
be what you're after but even if
portability is your chief concern it
makes more sense to buy a proper gaming
laptop GTX 1060 laptops are available
for below $1000 these days which is
again less than the cost of a
Thunderbolt 3 laptop plus a GTX 1070 GPU
and you'll be getting better performance
anyway the only reason I could see any
GPU making sense is if you meet several
very specific criteria you'd need to
already own a slim and light laptop with
Thunderbolt 3 that doesn't have a
powerful discrete GPU and you need to be
unwilling to purchase a similarly priced
and arguably more powerful gaming
desktop because you want the portability
of an e GPU configuration you'd also
need to be unwilling to ditch your
existing laptop for a portable gaming
laptop or unwilling to buy a second
laptop for gaming for just a few hundred
dollars more than an a GPU if you don't
already own a laptop or if you're
thinking of upgrading from something
incompatible with a GPS for example if
it doesn't have Thunderbolt 3 my advice
would be to buy a fully integrated
system that meets your gaming needs
rather than an eg PU that's either a
full gaming desktop in addition to
whatever laptop you want as I've
described previously or just a laptop
with an appropriate discrete GPU inside
there are plenty of options on the
market for those that want entry-level
experiences all the way up to powerful
desktop grade hardware and often it'll
be cheaper than buying an e GPU on top
of a laptop without discrete graphics
even though I don't recommend an H GPU
for most buyers I still think the
concept has some merit and could be a
decent option once the technology
matures if you could buy a cheap
enclosure that uses a next-gen
Thunderbolt technology allowing the GPU
inside to provide its full desktop class
performance it would be a neat way to
upgrade a laptops graphics with that
needing to buy a whole new system that
was the goal of these thunderbox re
enclosures but unfortunately it'll be a
while before it becomes a genuine
reality anyway that's it for this video

external graphics in the comments but
I'm really interested
