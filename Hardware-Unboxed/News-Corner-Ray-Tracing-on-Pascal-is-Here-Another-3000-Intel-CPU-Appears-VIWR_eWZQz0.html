corner decent week of news has just
passed some interesting stuff has
happened in a few cool product launches
April can be a bit slow as we grind our
way to Computex at the end of next month
but there are some interesting goodies
in here so well let's get on with it
one of the most recent releases from
this week is invidious new GPU driver
that unlocks ray-tracing for owners of
Pascal ensuring gtx graphics cards
driver version for 2531 is now available
and provided you have at least a geforce
gtx 1066 gigabyte or faster you'll be
able to use various ray-traced effects
in games such as battlefield 5 shadow of
the Tomb Raider and Metro Exodus in
video first announced support for ray
tracing on Pascal last month and the
driver has arrived as promised but to go
along with the release NVIDIA has also
delivered a series of benchmarks to show
how Pasco GPUs stack up compared to
current cheering r-tx GPUs with the
company's RT cause for proper ray
tracing acceleration the general thing
we're looking through these charts is
that in the best-case scenario according
to Nvidia at least the GTX 1080i
performs a little below the r-tx 2060
with ray tracing enabled with DL SS not
factored in however as you increase the
number of ray tracing effects and the
intensity of those effects the RT X 360
pulls even further ahead
for example the 2060 is pretty close to
the 1080 to iron shadow of the Tomb
Raider with RT X shadows but in Metro
Exodus with global illumination the RT x
2060 is well ahead in the atomic heart
demo with both reflections and shadows
the 1080 jaw is only half as fast as the
RT X 2060 it's also interesting to see
the truing gtx 1660 perform above the
gtx 1070 across most of the charts with
ray tracing disabled the gtx 1070 is
generally the faster card via said that
Turing's ability to run FP and int
instructions simultaneously
does give truing gtx cards a performance
advantage over pascal which does not
have that ability although naturally
true in GTX still falls well behind
Turing RT X I guess it's also impressive
to see that yes having the RT cords in
the design
does seem to be more efficient than
brute-forcing ray-tracing on more cooter
cause for example the gtx 1080i with its
GP 102 GPU is 471 square millimeters
whereas the RT x 2070 with tu 106 is a
little smaller at 445 square millimeters
however the RT x 2070 is significantly
faster and ray-tracing according to
invidious numbers there is a different
process note involved here as well but
generally this does show that for
ray-tracing specifically including those
caused was better than adding simply
more cuda cores of course this data
should be taken with a grain of salt
because it comes straight from nvidia
and naturally they do have an incentive
to make their art X cards look better
than their older offering so people
upgrade in fact even just releasing this
drivers support for ray tracing or
Pascal seems to be designed to encourage
upgrades owners of Pascal cards can now
see just how horribly that GPS will
perform while knowing that performance
will be a lot better on an r/t X card if
you can't see how bad the performance is
for yourself it can be bit easier to
dismiss our hardware is to run ray
tracing but now you might get a bit of
envy when you can't run these games with
every effect cranked up to the maximum
we'll have our own investigation -
Pascal ray tracing in the coming days so
look out for that to see where the
Pascal can perform any better than
nvidia is showing here in related news
Nvidia also released three new ray
tracing demos that you can try out
either on Pascal or ensuring we have the
Star Wars reflection demo + demos for
upcoming games justest an atomic heart
both justice and atomic art combined ray
traced shadows and reflections for more
ray tracing than we've seen in currently
released games Intel's Core I $9.99 90 X
II is now on sale sawed off this monster
CPU that sits atop Intel skylake extra
fresh lineup was previously supposed to
be an auction only product for EMS and
other system builders well it seems that
at least one system builder and retailer
who bought some of these CPUs
has decided to sell it as a standalone
CPU in addition to building pcs with the
chip inside case qing-ge have put up the
9990 XE for 3,000 euros which puts it at
aus pricing of around 2800 US dollars
this is a lot to pay for this sort of
CPU however it does offer the highest
single core frequencies and the highest
base clocks
of any of Intel's h EDT processes it
does only have 14 cause as opposed to 18
in the ninth 980 XE but it trades a 3
gigahertz base clock and 4.5 gigahertz
turbo in the 1980 XE from a 4 gigahertz
base clock and 5 gigahertz boost in the
9990 XE depending on your workload the
extra frequency of this course is
important especially for something like
gaming which isn't normally suited to
hed t CPUs of course at this price I
don't imagine too many gamers will be
rushing out to drop nearly $3,000 on it
given most people will be fine with a
9900 K at a fraction of the price it
will also be interesting to see how
popular the CPU is or how sought after
it becomes relative to both the 99 ATX
II with its increased core count and
mere $2,000 price as well as Intel's new
28 core h EDT cpu the 0w 31 75 X which
is around the same price at $3,000 TSM
C's 5 nanometer technology is on track
the company has completed development on
the necessary tools for 5 nanometers and
is moving into the RISC production stage
with high volume production expected to
be on track for 2020 TSM CS 5 nanometers
which the company is calling either
con-5 FF or just n5 is using their
second-generation extreme ultraviolet
lithography tools the first one with
these tools has been used for the
upcoming seven animator plus node TSMC
have also given a few preliminary
performance metrics for five nanometers
compared to their current seven
nanometer node we're not going to get a
huge jump like the transition from 60
nanometers to 7 animators but TSMC are
expecting a 45% reduction in area as
well as either a 20% reduction in power
consumption at the same performance or a
50% increase in performance at the same
power consumption level with seven
nanometer plus sitting about halfway
between seven animators and five
nanometers we're going to get a gradual
improvement over the next few years from
the sort of technology next up we have
the official announcement of a OCS AG 35
3 Series headlined by the AG 3 5 3 ucg
now if you've been paying close
attention to the display market and
remember some of these terrible product
names the AG 353 ucg was actually first
announced around a year ago as part of
an videos ultra wired chasing HDR lineup
this panel is meant
34:40 by 1440 VA 200 Hertz maximum
refresh rate and has full proper HDR
support in fact it wasn't just last year
that we first heard about these displays
at Computex 2017 we first saw models
from ASA and a soos were which were
subsequently delayed until the end of
2018 and today still aren't available so
it's been a long process for these
particular panels in any case AUC is
finally ready to release the AG through
5-3 you see G onto the market saying it
will be coming in June 2019 at an
undisclosed price although TFT central
believe this launch date will end up
around September or October at the end
of it with the price of 1,800 to 2200
euros that is very expensive but this is
a super high-end juicing HDR panel with
display HDR 1000 if ocation it's
essentially meant to be an ultra wide
equivalent to the 4k 144 Hertz Jason
Ketchum monitors we've already seen in
addition to the AG 3 5 3 u cg a you see
has announced there will be a free sync
two variants hopefully with identical
specs including a crucial 512 own full
array local dimming backlight I'd be
disappointed if that backlight was
exclusive to the g-sync HDR model but
you never know as for the competing ASA
predator X 35 and soos rog swift PG 35
VQ still no word on when those models
will be available but you'd think it
would be around the same time as the AOC
Morel for around that 2,000 euro or more
price tag couple more quick monitor
stories I wanted to bang through before
the end of this news corner one is that
a suit is unveiled its first mini LED
monitors these are designed to be
professional-grade monitors rather than
gaming monitors and they're such pack a
4k resolution at 60 Hertz and reproduce
97% of the DCI p3 spectrum and come with
a whole bunch of creative specific
features but the cool thing about these
mini LED designs is in the HDR
capabilities the larger 32 inch PA 32
ucx has 1,000 local dimming zones more
than most current LCDs of this size the
27-inch model has 576 zones as well
again very impressive for a monitor both
can do 1200 nits of peak brightness so
they can get display hgr 1000
certification now before you get
confused mini LED is not the same as
laughs crew led micro LED is a tech the
basically allows for per pixel local
dimming with LCD technology similar to
an OLED this tech is still years away
mini LED is a stepping stone on the way
there it's a new backlight technology
and it allows for these high zone count
local dimming arrays hopefully we see
them in gaming grade monitors soon we
also have news of an 8k 120 Hertz
display from sharp with HDR capabilities
including 800 nits of peak brightness
it's a 32 inch panel using XO technology
not many other details were disclosed
but still a cool look at what is coming
in the next few years final story for
the week we have a few leaks for the
upcoming NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 as
expected this is a short card without a
power connector which indicates the card
will draw less than 75 watts of power
this ZOTAC card is a dual slot design
with hdmi displayport and DVI connectors
while the console gain wood and power
that have leaked have just HDMI and DVI
all these cards come with 4 gigabytes of
gddr5 memory and are expected to feature
Nvidia stirring T u 1 1 7 GPU if you're
getting full leaks like this it
shouldn't be too long until the 1650 hit
store shelves will be very interesting
to see where it ends up performance wise
