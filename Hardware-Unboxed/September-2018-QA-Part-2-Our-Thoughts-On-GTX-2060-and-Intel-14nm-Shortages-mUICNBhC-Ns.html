part 2 of our September 2018 Q&amp;amp;A you'll
be able to see well you should have
already seen part 1 on the channel if
you haven't seen part 1 you're doing
this wrong yes so definitely go back
check out part 1 first this is part two
brand new desk as we talked about in the
previous episode check out actually
behind the behind the scenes video I
don't think we mentioned that lots of
patrons yes so the patron exclusive boss
sign up so I know just seeing us build
this it's pretty rare let's go into the
rest of the questions already ok this
next question quite funny we've got this
one because we touched on a minute ago
and Tim and I I don't know if it was on
the patreon livestream I can't remember
today's a bit of a blur we did discuss
this at length before and we were both
sort of scratching our heads about it so
anyway I'll read the questionnaire I
will there be and GTX or RDX 2060 is it
worth waiting for
currently I don't have a GPU so that's
the choice 1060 or wait for the 2060 did
I say 2060 of using the 2060 1060 thing
I'm still trying to work out the 2080
and and they'll be the 2070 and yeah
small change but my brain doesn't
compute it that quickly it'll take six
months before it sets in so anyway it's
an interesting question because the
question that we discussed well if it
was in part 1 or part 2 I don't know
what part were in at the moment we've
answered a lot of questions but yeah
it's coming I mean that's it oh yeah
it's coming it hasn't been confirmed
that it's a GTX 2060 I think the room is
they're currently saying that it won't
be your r-tx oh it won't have the tensor
cause ray-tracing cause it would disable
it would make sense because there's no
way to be powerful enough to do any kind
of real ray tracing worth a damn yep so
probably a GTX 2060 the big question is
is it worth waiting for
Tim and I seriously doubt it we don't
see how it can be they've got to be
competitive there yes I was speculating
earlier that you know we're probably
going to see it becoming slightly more
expensive than a 1064 slightly more
performance just judging what we've seen
this generation so yeah so in terms of
if we're
the best case is price versus
performance will get unchanged yeah so
you'll pay a little better and know
you'll pay a little bit more and you'll
get a little bit more which is not
terrible I suppose if the 2080 and 28 ET
i was like that you know people would be
happy for 2080 - I was only 30% or 40%
more than the 1080i that would be good
I don't think it's a week worth waiting
for though is the short version of this
answer yeah next question what are your
predictions for how rate racing will
work when to RTX cards are placed in SLR
using n V link will we see decent
scaling performance and actual good
frame rates with r-tx enables that way
so the question is if you lump to 2080
two hours together can you do better
than what we think will be 60 FPS at
1080p um well first of all the game
would actually have to support us how
high right Tracy
which is so supporting SLI is rare
enough as it is and then rate racing on
top of that probably extra rare well
that would be a rarity in itself but do
we have confirmation yet the SLI rate
racing work together I don't see why
they wouldn't yeah I don't know I
wouldn't have thought I'm not saying it
they don't I'm not even suggesting they
don't understand we don't we don't know
we don't know and you can't know how
funny would it be if it turns out that
it doesn't for some bizarre reason work
I think it does because they have shown
demos in the past running on multiple
voltage cars scrapped so I'm thinking
that I just thought of advanced I think
I'm thinking that it will be support it
would have been very humorous yeah I
mentioned the scaling will be similar to
how the games themselves scale yeah yeah
yeah so basically very limited support
like it has been I know everyone's
really excited MV link we've had so many
requests to test it out but if guys it's
SLI so game support sucks driver support
is me and as you were saying there's
very few games that support it there and
then there's even fewer of the games
that support it the support a while and
you see like 80 percent 70 to 80%
scalings 70% would be amazing scaling
there yeah I think that'll feel maybe
though
before the one was pretty high all the
time you're lucky to get 50% I think
five high five
was an 80% scaling game but you're right
most of them it's pretty pathetic okay
next question how is your thoughts about
Intel CPU shortage in my country of
Denmark the 8700 K has already risen by
around plus fifty dollars since
September 1st and it looks like it will
continue will AMD benefit from this well
yeah they will because your Intel
products will become less competitive
but yeah it's really interesting how
they're sort of struggling big time on
their 14 nanometer well in terms of
production and it's a knock-on effect of
the failed 10 nanometer
if you can't shift focus to 10 nanometer
and then not have it not work yes I
think I mentioned this before this is
totally my theory of what's happened but
so the original goal was to push a lot
of the CPUs that should be coming out
now to ten nanometer so stuff like
whiskey like that we've seen should have
been like ice wake or whatever it was
supposed to be called Cannon Lake and
all that but then they've had this big
order of modems for the iPhone and so
the previous modem that was used in the
iPhone 8 and X was on 22 nanometer but
then the new one that they using for the
iPhone 10s or whatever it's called
that's on 14 nanometer so when they have
to suddenly make like a hundred million
of these modems to supply Apple suddenly
a lot of the things that they're trying
to get made for like CPUs and chipsets
and all that other stuff is you know
that of capacity for that because that
all that stuff should have been by now
on 10 nanometer so it's a really
interesting situation where you know
obviously you take apples order because
they're a massive custom and they'll
make some tons of money other cups LM
can't upset a customer like that but
yeah it's kind of hurt their other price
segments I'm sure that they're keeping
the server market is close to
competitive as they can but for US
consumers we're like a tiny segment of
what they're manufacturing you know we
get shafted and yeah it just sucks so
yeah Amy there's certainly you know the
Verizon was already competitive as it is
but now it's looking even more favorable
yes it was already better in terms of
price versus performance and that's
obviously just gonna keep increasing
yeah okay next question
ger I have a burn to pee
since your view products that compete
with products I like you must be paid to
ignore my brand so I get that right okay
the serious part of the question is can
you please retort
which oh sorry can you place your talk
with a summary of how you select
products to review slash content to
produce so I may stop calling you a
shill thank you very much I swear you
asked for it by reviewing relevant stuff
in a timely strategic manner and the
best fits your healthy PR relationship
so if that was all a bit odd that
question I believe this viewer has
cottoned onto the fact that a few people
were upset with follow-up r-tx coverage
of the Gigabyte and msi cards where i
basically said terms of price versus
performance they're not worth buying
as per our day 1 and day 2 coverage that
aside if you have decided you want to
buy an Archie X card for whatever
reasons being fully aware of our day 1
and day 2 coverage then fine that's your
decision we are now record record either
recommending or not recommending these
particular board partner cards in the
cases of the MSI and gigabyte models
they were great products there was I
couldn't find a thing negative to say
about them
but that upset a few people and said
that they were paid ads because we
didn't have anything negative to say
about them it's like guys I'm not gonna
trash a product for no reason like if
you hear me trashing a practice I've
done plenty of times on the channel
there will be a factual reason for it
that we based on some sort of data that
we've come up with yeah and to be fair
to you know partnered models of like a
28 it's not it's not gigabytes fault
that the 20 80 GPU and invidious pricing
is bad like so if they're pricing it you
know higher than is required then that's
not great but it's you know they've
they've taken the GP and they're making
a product based around that and all of
those cards are quite good so yeah and
we're not pushing it saying this is an
amazing product you have to buy it as I
said we're saying if you've decided you
are buying an ITX car and you're trying
to work out which one to buy here's how
this one performs in all the metrics we
test yeah and we have
nothing bad to say about it yes I mean
the question is you know a summary of
how you select products to review
content to produce you know a lot of it
is just stuff that we want to test
because we're interested not just
hardware like you guys so you know a lot
of the time it's you know for a launch
we just want to reach out to board
partners and see how all the models do
or you know we might need some cards for
our own testing the future so we'll just
reach out to you know companies that we
work with before have good relationships
with like MSI like gigabyte like these
companies it's also not we're not also
like denying companies access to our
channel so you can ping and why I
reached out the first time ever and said
can you review the art x20 Emily yeah
love to
I would love to review all the Archy
ex-partner cards yeah it's just about
that I mean I'm not gonna tell anyone no
yes we get paid by MSI or gigabyte to
give them positive reviews so anyone who
wants to send us 90 X card that we
haven't already tested will happily test
yeah so that's usually how it goes you
know companies reach out to us they say
we want to check this out yeah we it's
interesting we say yeah especially for
GPUs and we had a few companies just
before the r-tx launch and the
announcements say we've got some Pascal
cards we heard rumors that they had a
lot of inventory though trying to move
so if they get an influencer a reviewer
testing those cards might result in a
few sales but we said not interested
yeah we're not interested in testing
Pascal further you guys aren't
interested in seeing any AIB Pascal
reviews where they are to the our tech
stuff's coming and therefore we bust
okay next question have you showed fast
sync and enhanced sync in one of your
videos before there might actually be
better than gsync and free sync when
your FPS stays near but higher than your
monitors refresh rate so in my video
talking about how many frames per second
do you need I did cover fast sync and
enhance sync because you know there's
just like vsync and that sort of thing
there might actually be better than
g-sync your free sync well it's not
really an equivalent to those
technologies g-sync and free sync work
below your monitors maximum and
frustrate and don't work above it and
soon
we fastened Canon head sink work above
your mother's refresh rate and don't
work below it so the ideal sort of
situation is you'd have your adaptive
sink tech working below the minors
refresh rate like free sink for example
and then you'd have enhanced sink
working above it so you have both the
technologies working at the same time
there are some issues with enhanced sink
though for example if your gameplay is
only slightly higher than your more is
maximum refresh rate you can get micro
stuttering because of the way it's
trying to buffer the frames and
everything like that the best thing for
enhanced sink is to have it run twice
your maximum refresh rate so if you have
a 144 Hertz monitor it's pretty
punishing to try and rather at twice
that for a sink but yeah like I said
they're sort of complementary
technologies and you know you can't
really have say I'm running on enhancing
for donut free sink you still get the
benefit if you have both ok Steve still
struggling with this throw so I'm now
delegated to asking you all the question
registered Aska with Intel about to go
to eight cores in its mainstream
offering how long do you realistically
think older quad core i5 and i7 will
remain viable going forward do you see
developers making six plus physical
cores mandatory wants new consoles land
in a couple of years or do you think the
existing huge install base of quad core
parts will keep them as a priority for
developers for a long time yet hmm well
thanks for the hard question well first
of all I don't think the consoles have
much to do with it because right now
consoles already have eight core CPUs
they'd only shag your eight cores
exactly that is a very important thing
to make no they it's good that that
means they will scale well across a lot
of cause if available but as we saw in
my video I did a while ago where I can
try to work out how future-proof Rison
really is if you've got four cores that
are just insanely fast and combined they
have more throughput than 16 cores then
it's not gonna make any difference
they'll always be faster depending on
how the workloads are split up and
whatnot
but obviously four cores are four cores
without any kind of SMT
they're on the way out so you can play
your games like fortnight no worries you
can use your low end graphics cards with
them even in demanding games like
Battlefield and I'll be okay will be
playable because you will be used to the
odd frame hitch and stutter that's why
it's a bit funny because if you have
built just a massively high-end rig with
your RT X 28 et eyes and your core
annoying process or whatever you have
and it's an absolute beast little frame
hitches and stutters is going to be
terrible you're gonna declare that
unplayable and not not good so that's
why people had problems with crossfire
back in the day and stuff like that on
the flip side of that if you've got an
Athlon 200 GE and a gtx 1050 and
occasionally you get a frame start
playing battlefield 1 multiplayer or
it's even quite stuttery you're going to
put up with that and play because you
haven't spent that much on your system
but there's a million ways to sort of
tackle this topic but the quad cores are
definitely dead now above mid-range
entry level stuff yeah I mean apart of
that question was do see developers
making you know 6 plus physical cores
mandatory no I don't think yeah because
our going out and saying you know yeah
it'll just run like god yes they'll just
be making their games work with the CPU
resources of the time so whether that's
you know six core eight core CPUs or
four cores and simply if there's too
many things going on on the CPU to run
on a four core then it won't run in your
meter stick school I don't think they'll
be seeing there I mean obviously there's
been some games say you know just won't
run on a dual core yeah but I don't
think they're gonna be there's gonna be
a massive amount of game suddenly going
we're locking this to six cores when as
you say so many people serve quad yeah
well six costs ten years down the track
basically four cores is still very you
know this CPU sold today for gaming that
have quad cores so the 7700 K in the
battlefield 5 testing which admittedly
was early access was really good better
than the rise in seven 2700 X yeah okay
now the DL SS question can d/l SS be
theoretically activated on GTX 10 series
GPS similar to how the ten series cards
ray-tracing demos I'll be at poorly
without the Artie cause I I don't think
it is possible because it requires a
tensor cause AI networking and the
accelerated integer processing which is
I think how they do a lot of that deep
learning stuff so yeah as far as
activating on Pascal I mean maybe they
could do it really slowly but I don't
think sonís it certainly won't be
enabled well the good news at this point
is it doesn't seem like it's worth using
on charades yeah again if you've seen my
video from hopefully a few days before
now on DL SS it seems like you can do
pretty similar techniques on Pascal to
get the same sort of image quality so
even if you could enable do SS it
wouldn't really be worth it over those
existing techniques again very early
testing done there we want to test it in
actual games please someone make games
that have this in it so we can test it
properly but yet as far as we can see
now yeah no it won't be supported on on
tensors and it probably won't even be
that important that it's not okay guys
what's your favorite game and your top 5
of all time including retro well wish I
had more time to think of this we did
yeah I luckily did think sort of and
that I might be able to give a few games
let me think
ah well my all-time favorite gee that's
tough because it's like your all-time
favorite movie
then you have as a child then you go
back and you watch it and you're like
yeah and for me that's because my
all-time favorite was command &amp;amp; Conquer
command clock of gold on Windows loved
that game play that's what got me into
computers and computer gaming yeah and I
recently went back and had a look at it
that's just unplayable it's so bad I
wish I never went back because I
remember being aureus yeah well I think
you know game there's a lot more things
that games do these days it makes those
you know what would have been really
innovative back then is now just a set
right so if we're going more recently
for me it'd be Starcraft 2 I put a lot
of hours into that love it I still like
it today I just don't play it anymore so
you got two games you need three more
for your top five gee there's been so
many games that I enjoy I like I like
the Battlefield series
which one oh and peek I've liked a lot
of the cooler duty games not so much
recently but I did like it definitely
not recently I love July cops for
example I loved well I'm going back in
for though I level one Cod one Cod -
they were awesome
Modern Warfare it's all good yeah
they're all good I'm even enjoying
fortnight well that make you top 5 of
all time fortnight
it's if I haven't yeah if I have more I
mean I really enjoy I don't know if it's
top 5 but because I love strategy games
Starcraft all that sort of stuff
I love the strategy of building in a
first-person shooter on the fly while
you're attacking people like that I
think that's why a lot of more
traditional first-person shooter gamers
don't like it because it's just like
mind blown it's you know so such a
disconnect from the norm and it was like
that for me Nisha Lee
but now yeah I love it ok yeah I mean my
top five would be slightly different as
not as much I like strange again so I
would say I definitely would have
civilization 4 in my top 5 okay that's
definitely my favorite in strategy games
slightly different those other ones but
I'd certainly have to say my favorite
game I thought a lot about this because
there's a lot of games I played I'd need
more time for sure um my the game I
thought was it's probably too new to
definitively say I'd have to go back and
look at the games I played earlier but
The Witcher 3 would have to be right up
there for me as a big fan of
role-playing games that's one of my
favorite genres of games so yeah The
Witcher 3 just sort of had great story
great gameplay love I play through
everything in that game like I I'm not
really a completionist gamer but I like
to play all the side quests so and one
thing great things about The Witcher 3
was that you play a lot of the side
quests it wasn't just boring filler
fetch quests there was a lot of actual
you know reasonable story to some of the
side quests so yeah really fun game to
get into that one I also have to have
GTA san andreas in there for sure the
best GTA game I like the newer ones too
but if I could only put one GTA game in
there okay it would be so Andreas I'm
assuming I'm keeping this 2 PC games
well so maybe the 2005 version of
star wars battlefront 2 as a big star
Wars fan that was pretty limited wasn't
it and the scope of the game it was much
better than the recent ones what in
terms of what you could do in it
ok though I thought the recent one
actually wasn't too bad a pamphlet right
they screwed it up
this the second one was the newer second
one was quite good as well but that has
a bit of nostalgia factor as one of the
games I played a lot as a child so yeah
what's that is that for games now
so that's battle Battlefront 2 san
andreas The Witcher 3 civilization 4 and
maybe like an older Sim City as work a
little Addison so yeah maybe SimCity
2000 yes I loved that as well that would
yeah it's a hard list to construct
because we're talking about over 20
years of gaming yeah I mean and I love
not quite as money for me you've ever I
loved
Rocka trainer as well quite clear
ocarina that was cool even the original
quake was awesome that was so much fun
multi age of empires as well that was
cool I played battle loss so there's
been so many great games it's yeah yeah
probably some ones that I'm embarrassed
that I'm forgetting there's definitely
something that people will be been to
fiercely typing the comments like how
could you not have mentioned that all
time great dislike something like that
you're half white I think half-life 2 is
a great game I wouldn't have any of my
top 5 games yeah it was good but I
wouldn't mind either so it's very
interesting question another I think
it's the last the OSS question that
we've gotten to do you think the fancy
upscaling used in DL SS will be accepted
by the PC gaming community since PC is a
platform where native resolution gaming
has always been a selling point well if
we put aside that again
we didn't big deal SS who's that Steve's
just gonna split because they're sick of
the DL SS talk about yeah and we're
putting aside whether we think DSS is
good or not I do think there will be a
little bit of that not being accepted
people wanting to play firmly at their
native resolution because you can
already change the resolution slider and
it's one of those things that lots of
people don't even touch even though you
just write it down like 80% and gain
massive frames for not that much quality
loss so
yeah I think it will struggle to be
accepted from the native resolution
crowd that really want that crisp sharp
looking image on their native display
res so I think you'll struggle a bit but
again I don't think it's that impressive
compared to downscaling anyway so this
is one of those things I wouldn't know
like it doesn't support all games if
it's something that you could just
enabling Windows and it works for all
your games then that'd be maybe kind of
cool but how how often a game is gonna
go now does this game have deal I said I
really want to use it does it have DL SS
yeah like half the time they're gonna
have an Archie X card the feature will
be there and they may even want to try
they'll use it they just won't yep so
yeah I think that's knowing that one
okay interesting username clam dong clam
dong asks why don't we have OLED
monitors and laptops so ipredator laptop
over there just decide to turn it on so
I think it's just randomly decided to
burn itself up but so don't don't what
happen there anyway clam dong asks why
don't we have all their monitors and
laptops and I was just about to answer
that so there are a few OLED laptops but
they're not gaining widespread adoption
because oh it has two main problems
firstly burn-in if you're running your
desktop which has the taskbar and if
you're in Chrome or for example that
will burn in overtime like a plasma
would the reason why it's not a big deal
for TVs use watch lots of different
things and all they doesn't burn in as
easily as plasma so it's not not as bad
as that bit certainly if you're running
Windows all the time you know your
monitor will degrade over time and yeah
it's even an issue on Android phones
that will do crazy things like slightly
shifting the display really yes they've
like basically they will move the icons
on the screen slightly to avoid burning
and that sort of thing but yeah much
bigger issue for running desktop os's
and for laptops as well running a full
white image on OLED
tends to use more power than an
equivalent LCD in general it's fairly
okay for power but because of the way it
works you know the backlight isn't
there's no backlight in it so running
full white imagery like you
PMPC would use more power so not as
effective for that either so yeah be
nice to see OLED but I just don't think
you'll really ever gain widespread
adoption until they fix that problem
which they might not ever fix here's one
for you Steve do you think the artex
2080 is put on a leash by Nvidia and
going to have a massive performance
increase in future drivers I mean it
doesn't really work like that does it
they want to sell them now exactly I
don't really want to sell them later
that's why fine wine isn't something AMD
strives to achieve like that's just a
limitation of their development budget
for software development driver team
basically so the ITX 2080
we well in my 35 game benchmark you will
have seen what it kept like how much
faster it can be than a 1080i and I
think it was up to 20% maybe in one
title yeah up to 10% and a few others so
I doubt you're gonna see much more than
that over the next year I mean they'll
be somewhere it's a little bit slower
someone's a bit faster but overall be
much the same but they're definitely not
holding it back deliberately okay final
question for the Q&amp;amp;A this is one I
haven't seen before it's a pretty
interesting question does the length of
a cable ever affect FPS if my DP cable
is one meter and I can get a hundred FPS
will the same be true for a five meter
cable so as far as frames per second is
concerned there will be absolutely no
difference between your one meter and
your five meter cable because it's a
digital signal well I'm having the fact
that it's just what making a difference
to what you're cheaper you can render
out with digital cables like DisplayPort
it either works or it doesn't
so either you'll get an image or your
image will either just won't work and
you get pixelation or that sort of thing
so that's why expensive HDMI cables or a
crock
yeah so--but you you do need a high
quality cable if you get something when
it's like 10 meters long please be
shielded yeah it needs to be nicely
shielded so that you don't get signal
degradation over longer lengths but as
far as frames per second he'll be
absolutely no difference no difference
in picture quality it either will work
or it doesn't
as far as latency in terms of
getting the image from your PC to the
display because the cable is longer it
will theoretically take longer to get to
your display so input latency to your
display will be slightly longer but
unless you're running like a hundred
meter cable it should make any
significant difference or the maximum
the spec can handle I don't know how
long you can go with yeah well this wave
is interesting you know things for
example in a stadium for example when
you have those big screens you see in a
stadium to get those all running at
exactly the same time with different
length cables that actually have to
delay the signal going to some of those
displays if the cables are so long
otherwise they're all out of sync so in
terms of that setup there's definitely
your engineers work out the latency
penalty from running longer cables but
when we're talking about not you know
possibly a killer meter of cabling as
opposed to one meter yeah it's not a big
deal for definitely right no no yeah
your regular PC enthusiasts all right
that concludes September's QA sessions I
hope you guys enjoyed Part one and Part
two and you've watched both part 1 and
part 2 and yeah thanks for all those or
thanks to all those that ask questions
and I guess I'll see you again next
month yep see you then we'll probably do
some more videos between now next month
you hope so yeah we'll see you in a Cure
a next month</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
