I'm your host Matt and in this video
we're gonna overclock the new sky like 6
gen core i7 6700 K processor I'm not
going to go into a whole lot of detail
about the processor itself or skylake as
we covered all this background
information in the original video on
benchmark the two processes that Intel
lead in their skylake released with are
the i7 6700 K and the i5 6600 K this is
the normal strategy for Intel is these
enthusiast processors tend to generate
the most high we demonstrated in the
original 6 to 700 K and 6600 ka videos
that the standard clock performance of
these two new skylake processors was
nothing to get excited about Intel's
media release kit said there would only
be up to about a 10% performance
increase and they were right oftentimes
it was actually much less this is pretty
disappointing news for a lot of people
that were very excited about skylake as
the rumor mill had been working overtime
and leaked information out there was
suggesting performance increases of up
to 40% now we mentioned in our original
video that our unit was an overclocking
Beast let's go and put it to the test
and find out first we switch to Advanced
Mode in the BIOS and move to the OC
Tweaker menu where we selected load
optimized cpu Oct setting and grab turbo
4.8 gigahertz from the list next we
checked out the CPU configuration
settings and you note that all that's
been changed the CPU ratio 248 and the
cash ratio 240 next we move to the DRAM
configuration and made sure that XMP 2.0
profile 1 was loaded before saving and
exiting the BIOS
the system now restarts successfully
loads Windows 10 in a few seconds and
once a Windows 10 we brought up a
magnified version of cpu-z as you can
see the processor is holding steady at
4.8 gigahertz and the ddr4 memory is
clocked at 3000 megahertz now let's move
on to run a quick Cinebench
multi-threaded test please note the
score reported here might be slightly
different to the score reported in my
graph so that takes the average from
three runs not just a single run and
that's it let's move on to the proper
benchmark results first up we retested
with Cinebench is multi-threaded test
originally the 6700 K managed 882 CB
marks right on par with its Haswell
counterpart the 4790k overclocked to 4.8
gigahertz we were able to milk 19.6%
more out of the system for a score of a
thousand and fifty five cv marks next we
ran Stanner bench a single threaded test
where the overclocked 6700 K was again
impressive at 4.8 gigahertz that scored
17 percent better than its original
clock speed and 21 percent better than
the 4790k the next test was a benchmark
we've only recently started using web
export originally the 6700 K was
slightly behind the 4790k but our
overclocked colleague manish is 16.8
just an improvement for 438 web export
points much better the 7-zip results are
also a lot better as expected where the
6700 K was originally 8.3 percent behind
the 4790k it was now 11% faster and it
managed a full 20% higher total myth
Smith's overclocked state in our
Microsoft Excel Monte Carlo workload
tests we also saw a significant
improvement I was able to get the job
done in 2.7 seconds which was nearly 23%
faster this time the Photoshop custom
workload benchmark also produced much
better results this time was faster than
both the 5775 C and the 4790k
at was 6.8 seconds faster than its
original score and eighty and a half
percent improvement finally we assess
performance with the hand brake
conversion test where the original 6700
K already led in its class it was able
to average more than 10 frames per
second higher which made for just shy of
an 18 percent performance increase I
admit this is very much a lazy overclock
but forgive me time was not on my side
it does prove a few things though
firstly that it's very easy to overclock
the core i7 6700 K on a Zed 170
motherboard such as that adds rocks dead
170 gaming k-6 secondly 6700 K
overclocking is very promising as we
managed to increase the clock speed by
20% over the base clock and 14% over the
maximum turbo frequency this led to some
pretty significant performance gains
offered in the vicinity of 20% the
overclock was achieved using the Noctua
NHD 15 which is widely regarded as the
best air cooler on the market
temperatures hovered in the high
eighties when benchmarking and again at
no point did we encounter any stability
issues the core i7 6700 case certainly
seems to be a much better overclocker
than the 4790k which maxed out at around
4.6 gigahertz thanks for watching this
overclocking video this has been Matt
