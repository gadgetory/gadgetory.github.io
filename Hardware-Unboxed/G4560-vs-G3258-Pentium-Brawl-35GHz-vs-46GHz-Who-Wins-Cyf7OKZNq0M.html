now if you're as old as I am you might
remember the good old days of
overclocking I'm talking about the days
when you could purchase a relatively
inexpensive processor and overclock it
to achieve flagship level of performance
take the Celeron 300 a for example now
this is a processor I have very fond
memories of I use this in the first
computer I ever built back in my high
school days and the reason I use this
protester was because it could be
overclocked with a few minor adjustments
in the BIOS it could run as fast as the
much more expensive Pentium 3 4 50
megahertz processor well roughly 20
years after releasing the first-ever
Pentium processor intel decided to
create the Pentium anniversary edition
shipped back in mid 2014 which we now
know as the G 32 58 this was an unlocked
budget processor and it was the first
time we'd seen a sub $200 processor from
Intel that could be overclocked in quite
some time in a way the G 32 58 was a
small nod back to the days when Intel
overclocking was fun and wasn't
exploited for profit as good as an
unlocked as well Joule core was back in
2014 for just $70 u.s. it was after all
still just a dual-core with support for
only 2 threads at the time we dreamt of
a similar core i3 chip and was
eventually rewarded with this 73 50k
almost three years later actually
rewarded is probably the wrong word to
use
but anyway Intel 7th generation Core i3
range looks pretty lackluster even with
an unlocked core i3 at the head of the
family the same thankfully can't be said
for the new hyper threading enabled
Pentium lineup these new cable 8
processors look really good well at
least the $64 g45 6 years anyway out of
the box the G 45 60 comes clocked at a
respectable 3.5 gigahertz of course
while this is 300 megahertz high in the
G 32 50th anniversary edition this older
unlocked Pentium processor can easily
hit frequency such as the 4.6 gigahertz
that I tested up that has the older
Pentium processor more than a 30% clock
speed advantage so it can
hyper-threading really make up the
difference this is the question a lot of
G 32:58 owners have been asking me over
the past few weeks so I decided to find
out I'm not going to bother testing the
G 32:58 at its stock out of the box
frequency I can't imagine anyone who
bought this chip knowing that it is
unlocked would do so also I won't be
using the GTX 1080 or Titan XP for
testing rather than more modest RX 470
will be used this should give us a good
idea of how these CPUs compare under
realistic conditions so with that let's
get to the results first that we have
battlefield one and not a lot needs to
be said here the G 4560 does a great job
with the RX 470 while the G 32:58
performs horribly even though you do see
a 37 FPS average with frame rates
constantly dipping below 20 fps the game
with a stutter II mess much the same
with in at 1440p and although the RX 470
does limit performance in the higher-end
CPUs the G 32 58 is still in no way
comparable given what was just seen when
testing with battlefield 1 I was shocked
to see such strong performance from the
overclocked G 32 58 in the CPU intensive
Civilization 6 apparently two cores will
work just fine here as long as they are
cropped I enough similar margins of Sena
1440p and again the overclocked
Anniversary Edition ship pulled ahead of
the G 45 60 and I have to say gameplay
was very smooth the performance when
playing deus ex man kind of either was
very similar to that of battlefield 1
though not quite as bad still with an
average of 50 FPS those dips down below
30 FPS were very noticeable when they
occurred at 1440p we see a 5 FPS
difference between the minimum and
average frame rates on the processors
with 4 threads or more the G 32 58 on
the other hand had an 11 FPS variation
and again this was noticeable due to the
stuttering effect that it created even
if one 2016 saw the framerate drop as
low as 30 FPS with the G 32 58 and this
limited the average frame rates are just
49 fps this meant the G 45 60 was over
30% faster and able to maintain much
more consistent performance once again
we find that even at 1440p the
anniversary edition ship is severely
lacking in terms of performance when
paired with the RX 470 usable for might
be a DirectX 12 title but it didn't help
out Intel's dual-core budget processor
from 2014
again the G 32 58 is considerably slower
than G 45 60 despite a massive clock
speed advantage the 1440p results didn't
look too bad but again with a larger
frame rate variation between the minimum
averages the G 32 58 didn't provide the
same smooth experience performance for
the G 32 58 in grand theft auto 5 was
very similar
under work was experienced in
battlefield 1 in other words it was
pretty much unplayable and a complete
stutter fest moving to 1440p things got
even worse and despite the 54 FPS
average for the most part I was watching
a slideshow the original South Park
series offered smoother animation
although frame rates were down the
Hitman the GCD 258 didn't play that
poorly in fact the game was very
playable that's it with the RX 470
taking care of rendering performance was
considerably better with the G 45 60 the
margins closed up at 40 and 40 P and
here the G 32 58 isn't terribly
different to the higher-end CPUs thanks
to the GPU bottleneck mafia 3 plays like
rubbish on most high-end systems so
unsurprisingly it's not a fan of the
dual core Anniversary Edition processor
like that'll still won and Deus Ex
mankind divided we find unplayable
performance even at 1080p things don't
improve in 1440p and that 11 FPS minimum
really says it all I actually expected
Mirror's Edge catalyst to play quite
well in the dual core performance was
extremely choppy just as I'd experienced
previously and a few modern titles such
as battlefield 1 there obviously wasn't
much point going on in testing 1440p but
I did so anyway just quickly here the
results not much else needs to be said
really so let's move on again I was a
bit surprised to find that even our
overwatch bot test hammered the G 32 58
so hard
despite its 4.6 gigahertz clock speed
that said the bot test is a very CPU
intensive test so the results shouldn't
be entirely surprising moving to 1440p
we still see a massive difference
between the average and minimum frame
rates when using the g3 258 quantum
break was playable using the g3 258 but
as you can see this processor loses
serious ground to the G 45 60 even at
1440p the average frame rate is in the
RX 470 as well down with the dual-core
processor
rise of the Tomb Raider around horribly
using either Intel Pentium processor
when paired with the RX 470 despite the
positive looking average frame rate the
minimum led to stuttering issues this is
of course also seen at 1440p and this is
one of the few games where I previously
found the g4 560 to perform much better
with the GTX 1050 TI
than it did the RX 470 finally have
total war Warhammer and here we see
despite being slower the g3 258 did
deliver play will perform
still this title really calls for a
quad-core at least a hyper threading
enabled dual-core with a hefty operating
frequency the numbers do even up at
1440p as the game becomes more GPU bound
thanks to the use of the rx 470 well at
this point I'm not even sure you need me
to summarize the results or give you my
opinion but as always you're going to
give it anyway the Pentium g3 258 didn't
cut the mustard in 2016 and it's
certainly not going to in 2017 for
modern gaming the dual core is well and
truly dead if you're playing games such
as rocket League than something like the
G 32:58 will work fine but for games
like Battlefield ones not so much
importantly I should also note the games
such as Far Cry primal Tom Clancy's the
division titanfall 2 Call of Duty
infinite warfare and doom will all
remove from testing as none of these
games played nicely with the dual core
they either failed to load crashed in
the game or performed so poorly I wasn't
able to run my tests meanwhile games
such as battlefield one day u6 mankind
divided grand theft auto 5 mafia 3
Mirror's Edge catalyst and rise of the
Tomb Raider were all unplayable using
the G 32:58 although I didn't look at
power consumption for this comparison I
can assure you that an overclocked G
32:58 consumes considerably more power
than the G 4560 so that's another nail
in the anniversary edition processors
coffin then overclocking the penny mg
32:58 anniversary edition ship was fun
while it lasted
but I think it's now time to move on the
G 45 60 is the new kid on the block and
I have been hyping the health out of
this thing for the last few weeks at $64
u.s. or seventy eight dollars Aussie
there's no denying it tastes seriously
goodbye and with the ability to upgrade
to a more capable core i5 processor or
perhaps even a core i7 down the track
makes it a safe investment I just wonder
though that if in a month's time we'll
still be singing the praise of the G
4560 things move pretty quickly and with
what's happening next month it may not
be the case but we'll just have to wait
and see on that note science meted out
of here and back to some more
benchmarking I'm your host Steve I'll
see you again soon
