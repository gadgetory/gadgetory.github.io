for this video we have a watchdogs to
performance benchmark and I have
gathered a shipload of results for you
guys as usual I have tested a low
current generation GPUs with pretty much
all the previous generation stuff as
well
the average and minimum frame rate data
has been recorded using the ultra
quality preset at 1080p 1440p and 4k for
the most part the core i7 6700k test
system clocked at 4.5 gigahertz was used
to measure GPU performance towards the
end of the video we will take a brief
look at CPU performance and CPU
utilization by comparing the 6700 K and
6600 K processors I'll also show you how
the games scale using various quality
presets on the Radeon R X 480 a gigabyte
and GeForce GTX 680 6 gigabyte graphics
cards testing takes place in a built-up
City area I picked a corner block to
load in to hijack a card did a lap of
the block and then returned to the scene
of the crime since you always load back
into the game where you left off it was
important for accuracy that we started
and finished in the same location each
time so without wasting any more time
let's jump to the results first up let's
check out how the old fellas get on here
we have the previous generation AMD and
NVIDIA GPUs surprisingly the fury X is
only able to match the standard gtx 980
while the TI model is a good bit faster
the r9 390x is also only slightly faster
than the GTX 970 not something you often
see and on that same note the GTX 970
outpaced the vanilla 390 the GTX 960 was
also able to match the r9 380 as well
though both I only averaged 29 fps using
the ultra quality preset at 1080p the
ultra quality preset is pretty brutal on
the previous generation GPUs the GTX 980
I was only able to average 45 FPS while
it dipped as low as 39 FPS the fury X on
the other hand only averaged 39 fps and
would at times go as low as 35 fps
basically it isn't really possible to
play on anything less than a GTX 980 or
nano here goes without saying that you
won't be playing watchdogs 2 and all of
its glory at 4k with a previous Jenner
raishin GPU even the frame rates on
current generation GPUs are a bit
miserable at 1080p the gtx 1066 gigabyte
for example only average 51 FPS and
while it is perfectly playable
performance at this resolution we hoped
for more the RX 480 is even worse
averaging just 45 fps and dipping down
to 39 fps using anything slower than the
RX 470 such as a gtx 1050 TI for example
gamers will really want to reduce the
quality settings
even the mighty gtx tandy can't average
60 FPS at 1440p and at times was found
rendering just 46 FPS gamers wanting to
push over 60 FPS or 1440p will require a
tie in XP yeah that's gonna go over well
the Titan XP was only able to average
forty-six FPS at 4k and yeah it costs at
least $1,200 us still if you have a lazy
$2400 us lying around then it is
possible to push over 60 FPS for GT X
1080 owners stick to 1440p and even then
the experience is less than desirable
here we have all the previous and
current generation GPUs thrown together
in one big mosh pit of results the 1080p
performance looks more like what we've
come to expect from these various GPUs
at 1440p in most games now for all the
1440p results hit pause here if you want
to have a good look at all the results
you probably don't need to see the 4k
results again but briefly here they are
please note the only reason I threw in
tight and XP SLI results was because I
used this setup for measuring high-end
CPU performance since I had the results
I added them to the graph since I don't
have a second fury X please AMD fans let
me get away with not testing high-end
crossfire performance from what I have
seen no crossfire does scale well on
this title so there is that next I
decided to see how the quality preset
scale using the gtx 1060 and RX 480
graphics cards first let's check out the
1060 results reducing the quality
settings to very high we see a rather
large 33 percent increase in performance
then from very high to higher further 18
percent performance bump can be seen
this means from ultra high we saw almost
60% more performance clearly those
rocking a mid-range GPU will want to try
out their very
or even high quality settings the RX 480
is still slower than the gtx 1060 every
step of the way but like the 1062 sees
huge performance gains when backing off
the quality settings dropping down a
very high improved performance by 38%
while going from very high to high
booster performance by another 23% here
we have a comparison between the gtx
1060 and our X 480 side-by-side please
note that overlays aren't working in
this title at this point in time so I
can't provide the usual on-screen
statistics using the Reaver tune-up
anyway you can see the fraps framerate
counter so keep an eye on that as we go
through this quick comparison
lastly let's compare the GTX 1063
gigabyte and six gigabyte models
side-by-side as you can see the three
give our model plays just fine at 1080p
and I should point out that we found a
similar experience between these two
models at 1440p as well
using the core i7 6700 K clocked at 4.5
gigahertz with the Titan XP handling the
rendering work I was shocked by how
demanding this game was on the CPU the
second we loaded into a game CPU
utilization was pegged at 100% where it
remained we notice no dissing
performance though or any kind of
stuttering
unsurprisingly given what we just saw
when using the 6600 okay the CPU
utilization was again locked at 100%
however we notice no large dips and
performance or any stuttering that said
the Titan XP was at times 30fps slower
when compared to the 6700 okay still the
core i5 processor had no issues
maintaining over 60fps at all times in
our test so it will work perfectly with
a gtx 1070 or something slower also I
should note that shadowplay was used to
record gameplay footage here using the
maximum bitrate and when not recording
the 6600 K allowed for slightly better
performance
well that concludes my testing of
watchdogs 2 for now at least anyway I am
keen to do a bit more CPU testing with
this title over the coming weeks I'm
also interested Ubisoft released any
performance patches over the coming
weeks
/ months visually the game looks good
not mind-blowing and not as good as the
framerate performance would suggest
still don't get me wrong I'm not
complaining about games being too
demanding if the game raises the bar for
visual quality then I will happily
accept low frame rates if the game
requires a Titan xp for 60fps
performance at 1440p but doesn't really
look that much better than last year's
Grand Theft Auto 5 expect an eyebrow to
be raised looking at the AMD vs. in
video battle it seems quite clear that
for now at least in videos GeForce GPUs
have a rather large advantage over their
Radeon rivals to anyone that says NVIDIA
giimpse their older generation products
just look at those gtx 980ti vs. fury x
results of course this is just one game
but it is a new game and the results for
end videos previous generation maxwell
GPUs look good for those rocking and
mid-range to low end GPU I suggest
trying out the very high or even just
the high-quality presets as we saw
significant boost in performance when
doing this with the rx 480 or gtx 1060
and the good news here being that the
down grain and visual quality isn't that
huge either well that pretty much wraps
things up for now I hope you guys
enjoyed the testing and as always stay
tuned because we do have more benchmark
videos coming later in the week I'm your
host Steve go get hacking</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
