soundblaster x85 gaming headset and was
very impressed with it overall the build
quality was there sound was good for the
price and creative armed it with some
practical useful features such as the
removable mic today I'm taking a look at
the H 5s little brother the Sound
Blaster xh3 designed as a portable more
affordable entry level gaming headset
the h3 headset can now be had for 70 US
dollars on Amazon a full 60 dollars
cheaper than the h5 model once you pop
this headset out of the box you can feel
how light it really is but it's
lightweight and all-around plastic build
the build quality is still there and
it's nice for an entry-level headset
nothing rattles when the headset is
shaken and the smooth black plastic is
nice to the touch an important feature
that lends to the headsets portability
is the way in which it folds down into a
smaller size the ear cups don't rotate
however to fold down to a flat form
they're simply folded side is small
enough as it is to fit into all kinds of
small backpack pouches the h3 is a very
light headset as mentioned and the ear
cups of soft and pillowy like those of
the h5 yarn between the ear caps is not
as prominently padded as that of the h5
there was a lightweight form factor this
was never a comfort issue unfortunately
for me my ears don't quite fit into the
ear cups of the h3 and actually find
this to be a bit of an issue during long
gaming sessions light weight of the
headset does help with this but I much
prefer ear cups that do fit around my
entire year now let's talk about the
sound as we know this is a smaller
cheaper headset so we aren't expecting
the same level of sound performance the
h5 delivered rather we hope they deliver
good clean sound for the price packing
40 millimeter drivers the h3 is able to
deliver just that it's not as rich and
full as that of its larger and more
expensive counterparts as you'd expect
but for the casual gamers not too picky
with the audio I believe will be very
satisfactory to wade with this the
headset comes pre tuned by creative to a
warm sound signature how much
this house is pretty hard to determine
you can also tune the sound some
predetermine sound profiles provided by
creative in their sound blaster execuse
tech engine light software similarly to
the h5 you aren't able to create your
own custom profiles however the inline
mic cable is braided however the remote
only features a volume wheel and a
microphone mute toggle unfortunately
there's no play pause answer hang up
button to control your media device or
smartphone the h3 is an analogue headset
and creative apps applied to
connectivity options you can choose from
e to the four pole single plug
three-and-a-half millimeter cable which
is suitable for smartphones media
devices and consoles or the wire split
cable that will suit most PC gamers
instead overall I'd say the sound
blaster
xh3 headset slots in nicely as the
entry-level headset in creatives range
just $70 they get the job done and will
suit gamers on-the-go who want a quick
and easy no fuss headset the won't take
up too much room in their bags the sound
quad is their - and suits the
entry-level as consumers at this price
point are unlikely to be hooking these
up to an amplifier or a sound card
anyway the detachable mic and supply
connectivity options are a bonus for me
however the lack of inline remote
functionality could be annoying for
those who want to use these on the go
