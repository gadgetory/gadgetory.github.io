we're grabbing a bunch of second-hand
graphics cards and pairing them with the
core i3 8100 to see how they compare to
the new Raven Ridge ap use and as always
we won't be just focusing on performance
but also value during a time of extreme
graphics card prices the Rison 320 200 G
and Verizon 520 400 G off the game is a
very affordable means of building a
basic gaming PC in terms of value the
2200 G has appeared unbeatable in all of
our tests so far but what if you pick up
a secondhand graphics card at a great
price
would that be a better option well today
I plan to find out but before we get
into it today's video has been sponsored
by Alliance heroes of the spire and this
is a must-have mobile game through you
RPG fans with over 10,000 combinations
and 400 unique heroes Alliance offers
ultimate freedom of choice like no other
not only that but all the different
modes will keep you engaged and
entertained there's a real-time PvP mode

course massive guild and nation battles
Alliance is also free to play and if
that wasn't sweet enough download
Alliance by the link in the video
description and get a bonus 50,000 gold
and 50 gems right away so go check it
out and thank you to Alliance for
sponsoring this video so for this
comparison we have eight games on the
menu and six secondhand graphics cards
covering a range of prices for the most
part all of the discrete graphics cards
have been tested with the core i3 8100
using 16 gigabytes of ddr4 2,400 memory
then for comparison the Raven Ridge ApS
have been tested using their Vega r8 and
vaguer 11 integrated graphics and
they've been paired with 16 gigabytes of
ddr4 3,200 memory for the most part I'm
not focusing on overclocking performance
but we will touch on that briefly
towards the end of the video along with
a quick look at discrete GPU performance
with the 2400 G testings being conducted
at 30 P and 720p and yes budget gamers
do often play at this low resolution and
believe it or not you can still have a
whole heap of fun you'll also have to
compromise on image quality settings as
well so
I've tested using appropriate quality
settings so keeping all that in mind
let's jump into the benchmarks starting
with the 720p results we see at the 2400
years only able to roughly match the GT
1030 which is a current generation
entry-level GPU it's interesting to see
that the now eight year old flagship
GeForce GTX 580 was 13% fast in the 2400
G of course that gull is about 20 times
more power so keep that in mind the gtx
750ti
is a standout here offering 23 percent
more frames on average and that's a
pretty decent performance uplift right
there that said the r7 370 runs away
even further offering over 40% more
frames while the GTX 760 and HD 7950
were faster again before you get too
disappointed though be aware these older
graphics cards aren't cheap and we'll
discuss that more towards the end of the
video then jumping at 1080 P this really
hurts the AP use in star wars
battlefront - even with the low quality
settings the games just two memory
intensive and the lack of dedicated
video RAM really is a problem here as a
result the ultra entry-level GPU such as
the GT 1030 and rx 550 start to pull
ahead well ahead in the case of high rx
550 meanwhile the gtx 750ti was 35%
faster on average and 46 percent faster
when comparing the 1% low data moving on
we have csgo and this title is as much a
cpu test as it is a GPU test especially
at 720p I suspect those 1% lower results
are a limitation of the rise in CPU or
the games ability to properly utilize
horizon but we won't get into that I
think it's more of a CPU limitation than
it is a Vega GPU limitation in fact we
do see clear evidence of this we're
moving into tiny P here the Vega 11 GPU
and so the 2400 G is now able to match
the GT 1030
for csgo players seeking big frame rates
you'll ideally want an Intel quad core
but it has to be said value for money
the 2200 g and 2400 g do do very well
here providing a smooth playable
experience still the core i3 8100 with
the old gtx 660ti
does allow for over 70% more frames on
average next up we have dota 2 and the
Raven Ridge abs are much more
competitive here particularly at 720p
that said the core i3 8100 with the G
check 752 I was almost 50% faster when
comparing the 1% low data and 65% for
the average framerate the margins remain
much the same at 1080p and while the
experience was still very good with the
AEP use it was noticeably smooth than
with the core i3 8100 and gtx 750ti
combo for example the r7 370 also
allowed for a minimum of 60 FPS at all
times in our test fortnight battle
royale plays very well on the Raven
Ridge ap use at 720p you can't really
complain with the 2400 G though the fact
that the r7 370 and gtx 750ti are over
40 percent faster means that you will be
able to crank up the visual quality
settings and still maintain over 60 FPS
at all times
moving on to turn EP shows how limited
the AP use can be in terms of
performance and while the 2400 g did
manage to roughly match the rx 550 and
GT 1030
it was world's slower than the gtx 750ti
on r7 370 those particular discreet
graphics cards offered 60% more
performance which is obviously very
significant like csgo overwatch is
another title that's primarily CPU bound
at 720p
however unlike csgo overwatch does do a
good job of utilizing the rise than CPUs
as a result the 2200 g and 2400 G looks
very solid and this time are comparable
to not only the rx 550 and GT 1030 but
also the HD 7950 and r7 370 has to be
said though that these AMD GPUs do
appear to be running into some kind of
bottleneck that isn't faced by the
GeForce competition removing at 1080p
sees the r7 370 HD 7950 pull away though
they still trail the GeForce GPUs by a
reasonable margin the gtx 750ti for
example is faster than the HD 7950 and
41% faster than the 20 or 400 g so while
still very playable on the AP use at
1080p you can get a much better
experience with a previous generation
budget discrete graphics card moving on
now one of the worst experiences had
when testing the Raven Ridge ApS for the
first time was seen in pub key the game
was playable at 720p though the 2200 G
did suffer from stuttering issues at
times that said though in this
so we can see the graphics cards such as
the gtx 750ti we're only 19 percent
faster than the 2400 g you really need
an r7 370 or a gtx 660ti to push past 60
FPS at all times using these low quality
settings in fact despite using the low
quality preset pomp G is difficult to
run at 1080p and I don't recommend
either apu for this task based on the
data he'll ideally want a gtx 760 or HD
7950 for a smooth experience the second
last game tested is Rainbow six siege
and here the AP use were very
competitive interesting with the GTX 580
tanked at 720p though this is likely
down to a driver issue meanwhile the
2500 G wasn't a great deal slower than
the gtx 750ti the AP users remain
competitive at turning opinion the 2400
g was able to live with gtx 750ti light
performance that said upgrading to the
gtx 660ti r7 370 or even the GTX 760
will net you between 40 to 50 percent
extra performance finally we have rocket
League and although the AP who's managed
to maintain over 60 FPS throughout our
tests they were significantly slower
than almost all the discrete graphics
cards tested on the core i3 8100 this
was again the case at 1080p
here the gtx 750ti was a whopping 81
percent faster than 2400 g while the gtx
760 wasn't that far off being three
times faster so while playable in rocket
league this wasn't a great result for
the AMD apus in terms of cost per frame
of course you can overclock these EPS
for higher frame rates but for best
results you will want to spend an
additional 10 to 20 dollars on a tower
style air cooler for a quick look at
this I overclocked the GPU in both
models to 1.6 gigahertz and the CPU
cores to 3.9 gigahertz and checked out
the performance in Rainbow six siege
here we see that overclocking the 22
energy boost performance by about 20%
and this is enough to place it on party
stock 2400 G meanwhile we could only
improve the 2400 GS performance by about
8% though in this test that was enough
to place it ahead of the gtx 750ti
and rx 550 of course while you can't
overclock the core i3 8100 you can
overclock all of these graphics cards to
receive at least 10%
performance so it's somewhat of a point
finally I just wanted to take a quick
look at how the Radeon HD 7950 performs
on the rise and 520 400 G compared to
the core i3 8100 I will look at this in
much more detail in a future video but
for now this should give us some idea of
what to expect here we see in Rainbow
six siege at 1080p using the low quality
preset the core i3 8100 is 17% fast and
the 2400 G when comparing the 1% low
data that's a pretty significant
advantage and while we might not see
this in all titles it means for gaming
with a discrete graphics card the
coffee-like CPUs can at times enable
much greater performance despite using
much slower ddr4 memory okay so that
didn't look particularly good to be
honest it has to be said though that
virtually all of the discrete graphics
cards feature in this comparison are
very good
well most gamers might scoff at a gtx
750ti in 2018 but it does still pack 640
cuda cores in a 148 millimeter squared
eye and with 2 gigabytes of dedicated
gddr5 memory on a 192 bit wide bus and
enjoys a bandwidth of 88 gigabytes per
second my point is no integrated GPU
that existed ever has been able to hold
a candle to something like that and well
you could argue that neither can the
Raven Ridge AP use they do do
significantly better than anything
that's come before them and here's a
quick look at the eight game break down
using the 1080p data across the eight
games tested the gtx 750ti was on
average 38 percent faster than the 2400
g and 60 percent fast and the 2200 g so
that's a bit brutal to be honest it also
gets quite a bit worse when you look at
the r7 370 gtx 660ti and so on so we
know the 2200 G with its CPU and GPU
combo cost just $100 u.s. and the 2400 G
170 dollars u.s. but how much do these
older graphics cards cost on the
second-hand market well this is a bit of
a difficult question to address because
pricing in the used market varies quite
a bit as is the case with new graphics
cards pricing from just a few months ago
is completely irrelevant today for
example you managed to get a gtx 750ti
for $30 three months ago and while
that's a great price getting one for
that price today though might not be
possible especially depending on where
you're situated in the world but in any
case it's still going to be mighty
difficult hopping over to ebay.com and
pulling up all the completed listings so
far this month we see that the average
selling price for gtx 750ti was $68 u.s.
that then is about what you could expect
to pay for one of course you might get
lucky and get one for $40 or you might
get unlucky not do your research and get
rolled for say $90
you might also of course get rolled
paying just $40 the card could rock up
and be dead on arrival and then you have
to deal with all that and that's just
the fun of second-hand shopping anyway
all that aside I've got to worked out
the average selling price for all they
used graphics cards featured in this
video and done a cost per frame analysis
this then is what we're looking at and
it places the AP use in rather poor
light however we are missing a key
ingredient the CPU while the 2200 G with
its rise in CPU cores and vaguer eight
GPU costs just $100 u.s. the r7 370 or
the gtx 750ti or any other of discreet
graphics card featured in this video
aren't much good without a CPU for
testing I used the core i3 8100 and that
costs 115 dollars u.s. so that value
really needs to be added to the GPU cost
so adding in the core i3 8100 price
let's see how the graph looks now okay
so that looks much better for the APU so
the 2200 G in particular is very
competitive but you'll have no doubt
noticed that it's still not the best
value option the core i3 8100 paired
with the gtx 760 was about 10% better in
terms of value despite costing twice as
much the GTX 580 is also slightly better
as well though that particular graphics
card does consume copious amounts of
power making it a very hot item
basically though what this is showing us
is that in terms of value the 2200 G is
excellent especially when compared to
brand-new hardware the 2400 G is still a
decent option but for budget shoppers
it's far less attractive and it's not
terribly difficult to get a better deal
shopping secondhand
and all this pretty much falls in line
with what I said in our day 1 Raven
Ridge coverage that said though this
still isn't the full story both the core
i3 8100 and Raven Ridge ApS will require
a new motherboard and ddr4 memory if you
already have a be 350 motherboard you
probably are upgrading to an EP you so
that scenario doesn't really make sense
chances are if you're getting an APU you
do need to buy a new motherboard so if
we factor in the motherboard and memory
prices things do change quite a bit
this next graph adds $70 to all the
configurations for a B 350 or a B 360
motherboard I expect those will be out
quite soon and then $85 for 8 gigabytes
of ddr4 2400 memory and that is for the
core i3 configurations which there's all
the discrete graphics cards and then 105
dollars for ddr4 3200 memory for the AP
use the turtle platform cost of each
configuration is listed in the following
graph and like that the AP you look a
lot less attractive once you factor in
the entire platform cost they're
actually considerably poorer value when
compared to the core i3 8100 with a
secondhand GPU as I noted my day 1
review they are better value than the
core i3 with a new graphics card but the
second-hand stuff gives this combo the
edge it's also interesting to note that
while the 22 energy was 32% cheaper than
the 2400 G when comparing just the price
of the AP use the 20/20 is just 8%
cheaper when comparing the entire
platform cost okay so how useful these
new AMD AP use really are depends on
your needs and how you go about
upgrading or building your new system
if you're building a brand new PC from
the ground up and you're confident you
can get a decent graphics card on the
second-hand market then you're probably
best off with the core i3 8100 for
example the core i3 8100 and geforce gtx
760 for example might cost twice as much
as the 2200 g but once you factor in the
price of the motherboard and the memory
modules that $100 difference over the 22
energy becomes a lot less significant in
fact that combo cost just 30% more now
once you factor in those additional
components then if you will also factor
in the cost of a case power supply and
all the others
stuff then the margin just continues to
shrink and it becomes very insignificant
at that point so at this point you might
be wondering why I recommend AMD APU at
all well compared to other new harbour
options they are actually very cost
effective not everyone can all wants to
buy a secondhand hardware and there are
obvious pitfalls to doing so for those
content with a low end gaming solution
but would like a platform they can build
upon for years to come
the 2200 G is a unique choice get
yourself a decent be 350 motherboards
some ddr4 memory and in a year or two
you could be rocking an affordable 8
course 16 thread CPU the 2400 G isn't
quite as attractive but with 4 cores and
8 threads it is a very solid gaming
choice and it will be for years to come
and it offers excellent frame time
performance and drop in a mid-range or
high-end graphics card down the track
and you're good to go
of course it all gets more complicated
when you introduce other CPUs for
example you can purchase the Pentium G
45 60 with a H 110 motherboard plus a
secondhand geforce gtx 760 graphics card
for about the same price as the 2200 g
combo and in most games it will be a lot
faster for non-gaming tasks though the
2200 G is a much more powerful CPU and
for the G 4562 really makes sense you
have to rely on getting a good
secondhand graphics card for the right
price with almost limitless options I'm
