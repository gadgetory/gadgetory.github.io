companies in the network-attached
storage business right now is QNAP
having just reviewed their niche but
still very cool TBS 453 a a compact book
size Nast we now have an ass that
doubles as a massive USB storage device
the new TSX five point a series that's a
few tricks up its sleeve the most
unusual of which is called USB quick
access of course you can do all the
other stuff that we've come to expect
from Coon apps high-end home storage
devices for example the inclusion of
HDMI means you can connect these new
Neph servers directly to your TV
allowing them to act much like a home
theater PC 4k playback and transcoding
as an offer year - powering this new
series is the latest generation Intel
SOC codenamed Braswell the particular
model in question is the sour one and
30-60 at least this year it's a 4 watt
system-on-chip
featuring a dual-core processor clocked
at 1.6 gigahertz but can run as high as
2.4 gigahertz depending on the workload
there are two models of this nass one
supporting just two three and a half
inch drives and the other supporting
four on hand with the larger 4 bay
version notice the t s 4 or 5 1/8 apart
from the snappy little sour on process
that this model also comes with a base
memory configuration of 2 gigabytes and
those were the bit more cash to splash
you can pick up the 4 gigabyte version
the 2 gigabyte model retails for 407
u.s. or 700 Aussie while the beefier 4
gigabyte model sets your back 510 or
roughly 740 Ozzy my advice would be to
grab the 2 gigabyte model and then spend
the difference upgrading to 8 gigabytes
using a pair of four key but modules low
voltage ddr3 1600 memory is very cheap
right now suspending for us or a little
over 50 Ozzy won't break the bank
the advantage to running more memory in
this device is much the same as the
Disney's standard desktop system you can
run more stuff at once without getting
bogged down
externally the ts 4 or 5 1a looks good
it comes exclusively and wide and
features a greenish looking strip down
the side which houses all the activity
lights and i/o stuff speaking of which
you'll find 8 LED status lights which
indicate things such as Network hard
drive USB and SD activity speaking of
which there's an SD card reader position
alongside the led
it's and this is the nice type so it'll
be greatly appreciated by content
creators and photographers below that we
have the power button which illuminates
blue and active followed by a quick copy
button and an accompanying USB 3 port
then we have a USB 3 micro beep or which
seems strange until you realize that
that's part of the USB quick access
feature more on that shortly the device
measures 160 millimeters wide 169
millimeters tall 219 millimeters deep
and tips the scales are just three
kilograms when empty of course once
loaded with four hard drives that would
get a good bit heavier and I can't
imagine to many will be keen on lugging
it around with them around the back
there's a surprising amount of
additional connectivity starting from
the bottom we have a connector for the
96 watt power brick dual Gigabit
Ethernet ports two USB 3 ports an HDMI
output 2 audio jacks for audio out and
in and finally a system maintenance port
as you might expect there are four
hot-swappable drivetrains these can't be
locked into place and said simply unclip
and slide out as the hard drives
themselves you're free to use any two
and a half inch or three and a half inch
drives the latest and greatest 10
terawatts are also supported of course
whatever you install you'll be limited
by the Gigabit Ethernet connection which
is good for roughly a hundred megabytes
per second the biggest performance
limitation on today's high performance
nas devices is unfortunately the gigabit
network interface recently IAEA which is
short for Institute of Electrical and
Electronics Engineers did approve the
new standard for two and a half gigabit
per second and five gigabit per second
Ethernet which will deliver up to five
times the bandwidth across existing
cat5e or cat6 cables very cool stuff
indeed but it'll be some time before
supporting controllers arrived so this
won't impact the tiers 4 or 5 1a at all
I just thought it was cool and well I
got a bit off-topic getting back on
track let's talk more about bandwidth
but this time focusing on the USB quick
access port so the idea here being that
those without convenient network access
at a certain location can just use the
USB port to access data on the NASS
using it much like you would a large USB
hard drive they'll be at a massive one
alternatively at home you didn't have a
wired connection available but wanted to
backup your laptop for example rather
than spend all week doing it wirelessly
you can connect it by your
speed of the NASS and do it that way
sadly you won't be able to enjoy full
USB three speeds though rather you're
still limited to a gigabit bandwidth as
the controller supporting this function
is actually a gigabit network controller
with USB functionality so a bit of a
downer but still worlds faster than most
wireless connections the only other
issue being for some reason Cunha didn't
include a USB 3 micro B cable in the
package so if you plan to use this
feature and make sure you acquire that
cable because the TS 4 v 1a is much more
than just a dumb USB Drive you can
change the authentication mode required
for access and data for those not
concerned with security measures you can
set access to anyone meaning any user
can access the data without needing to
authenticate with a username or password
alternatively accessed by a USB can be
restricted to certain users or groups or
set to the NASS default which means
users will have access using the
username a password USB quick access is
a unique feature though I'm not sure how
many of Coon apps customers will find it
useful it isn't a feature I personally
find useful although that doesn't mean
others won't what I do find useful the
home theater PC like functions largely
made possible by the HDMI output it is
worth pointing out that while 4k
playback is supported it is limited to
30 Hertz still for movies and other
media this shouldn't be an issue
complementing these media functions
isn't included c√ºneyt remote which is
an essential bit of kit when using the
ps4 v 1a as a home theater PC
replacement performance wise the ts4 v
1a is more than fast enough when moving
large files that easily maxes out the
Gigabit Ethernet connection and even
when moving heaps of smaller files such
as images we found that upload and
download speeds staying above 70
megabytes per second for this review I'm
not gonna dive into the qts operating
system it's simply too massive and
feature-rich to cover here I will say
that software setup and usability is
amongst the best in the business the
user-friendly interface will keep even
the most inexperienced users out of
trouble while the tech savvy guys will
still enjoy getting to the more advanced
stuff combined with the excellent
software hardware and features said the
QNAP ts4 v 1a is without question one of
the best nas devices have seen for home
users the only problems I have a mostly
focused on the new USB quick access
feature the package should include a
micro beaker
and ideally we want the true USB three
speeds when using this feature I
strongly recommend the forebay version
over the smaller tube a model as well as
you get the most bang for your buck
other than that it was happy times with
the TS four five one nine what do you
guys think cuz this an ass you'd be
considering for home use let me know in
the comments I'm your host menace always
and I'll see you guys next time cheers
guys for joining me for another episode
of Hardware unbox so those of you that
already support the channel thank you so
much it's truly appreciated and to those
of you that would like to support the
channel directly I do have Amazon links
and a patreon link in the video
description below thanks a lot and I'll
see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
