another day another set of testing to be
done this time we're looking at the very
first set of official rise and mobile
GPO drivers to come from AMD themselves
owners of Ryze mobile app drops
everywhere have been waiting for this
day for months and months now so the
fact these drivers are finally here is
great news for the small growing
community of rising laptop early
adopters so let's backtrack for a moment
to tell the full story of rise and
mobile laptops the first devices to use
rise in mobile launched at the tail end
of 2017 and while performance in some
cases was pretty good thanks to the
powerful integrated GPU it quickly
became apparent that work needed to be
done on the software side GPU
accelerated productivity apps either
crashed frequently or didn't work at all
there were issues playing some games
than the laptop despite having enough
GPU horsepower plus there were plenty of
odds and ends that needed tidying up
with new drivers the hard way was there
just wasn't very polished and there was
a quintessential early adopter feel to
the platform over time it became
apparent that AMD and the OEMs weren't
going to patch these problems in a
timely fashion
aim he blamed the OEMs for being
extremely slack and pushing out software
updates and that's true to an extent but
realistically the platform needed proper
drivers available through AMD calm
throughout 2018 many users discovered
that hacking aimed these newer apu
drivers to work on their reisender
laptops delivered a more stable
experience with better performance but
this was an unofficial hack to get a
solution rather than AMD or or ems
directly addressing the problems through
official update streams those who had
bought rise in mobile laptops for the
fast integrated GPU and a portable form
factor quickly became frustrated users
became annoyed at the lack of day one
driver optimizations for new games which
were available for APU and discrete GPU
owners that annoyed screw into anger as
some systems hadn't received a single
GPU update for a year while those within
video even Intel GPUs received
reasonably regular updates plus with
that proper drivers rise and robot
owners Werft without a lot of the cool
driver features available for discrete
GPU owners thankfully Amy listen to all
the complaints and as of this week has
finally launched
official rise in mobile GPU drivers you
can download through AMD calm these
drivers can be installed on any rising
mobile device whether that's a new
system or one of the original rise and
laptops it's not locked down by OEMs
it's designed to work as a generic
updated driver for all it may have taken
over a year but at least the drivers are
now available naturally I wanted to test
these new drivers and compare them to
the original drivers that shipped with
rise in mobile laptops and that ones
that didn't get updated for ages and
that's what this video is all about I
still have my original HP Envy x-360 15
inch with the risin 5 2500 you inside so
when the new drivers were available I
installed them updated a whole bunch of
other things like windows the BIOS and
other utilities that had received
updates since I reviewed the system and
put the updates through their paces so
the driver version I'm testing here is
Randy on software version 19 2.3 the
latest version isn't filming I'm going
to go through our usual suite of laptop
benchmarks to see how the HP Envy x-360
performs now compared to how it launched
back in 2017 there's also going to be
some game testing later with direct
before and after comparisons focusing on
improvements from just the drivers alone
I'm not going to bore you with the
results from our CPU limited workloads
like PC mark 10 video encoding MATLAB
7-zip and so on there's really no
difference in performance between the
original launch state of rise and mobile
and today with the updated drivers this
makes sense the drivers are GPU drivers
and many of the apps we benchmark don't
use the cheap you at all so if you're
expecting a few more Cinebench points
from updating windows installing a new
bios and grabbing Radeon Software 19.2
2.3 well pretty much think again where
the benefits start to come in is in GPU
accelerated productivity workloads
blender is a prime example I reviewed
the envy x-360 I could only get blender
to successfully complete our benchmark
render once every other time it crashed
or stalled was pretty much a complete
disaster the app was unusable for anyone
that actually was going to go and do any
creative work in it since these driver
updates with that updating the blender
application itself the benchmark now
completes every single time so that's a
massive stability improvement
performance is also improved our blender
benchmark which runs entirely on the
EU was 17% faster after all of these
updates that's a pretty handy
improvement placing Amy's integrated GPU
around the mark of Intel's latest Core
i7 85 65 you in a 25 volt configuration
running the workload on the CPU given
this is comparing a verizon 5 APU to a
generally much faster Intel Core i7
that's a pretty good result purely from
software tweaks and GPU acceleration
even better is the ability to run some
benchmarks that didn't work at all
previously Adobe Photoshop for example
had problems with acceleration with the
initial set of drivers now it does work
allowing the Rison 5 2500 you to
slightly outperform the Core i5
8250 you in our iris blur test Compu
bench is another workload I had a lot of
problems with originally half the test
didn't work at all the other half would
frequently crash to the tune of about 10
crashes for every one workin benchmark
run with the latest drivers there were
still a few crashes but they are pretty
infrequent and generally it's now
possible for the entire benchmark suite
to run with that issue performance isn't
improved but better stability is
certainly welcome I still had issues
with Adobe Premiere though even with all
the latest updates horizon 5 2500 is
still unable to GPU accelerate the
crucial de mettre color effect in
premiere with 4k footage limit trees are
widely used affect among creators for
color correction and while applying this
to 4k footage might seem intensive it
can easily be GPU accelerated on intel's
integrated graphics and all of invidious
recent discrete GPUs the effect not
working with rising mobile is a definite
outlier
although lumetri is bizarre is still
compatible with 1080p footage and below
with this processor many other GPU
accelerated effects also work however
our premier benchmark uses 4k footage
and lumetri color effects this means
even today
rice and mobile gets destroyed by a mere
Intel Core i5
8250 you taking over 30 minutes to
render on the CPU alone without luma
tree effects the risin fire of 2500 U is
faster I have flagged this issue to aim
B again so hopefully their driver team
will look into it or at least provide an
explanation as to why this GPU
accelerated effect is incompatible with
rise of mobile cheap
if it turns out it's not possible to fix
moving on to games and once again here I
want to stress how much better this new
drivers with regards to stability
crashes and other technical issues
previously I had all sorts of problems
with rising mobile gaming sometimes I've
learned a game and the GPU had under
clocked itself massively compared to the
previous load sometimes a game would
only work in full screen mode and
present artifacts when using borderless
windowed mode sometimes a game would
have vsync forced on despite the option
being disabled everywhere there are also
generic crashes and system reboots it
was pretty much a disaster even in
lightweight games like fortnight with
the latest drivers I haven't experienced
any of these issues all the games that I
previously had trouble with now work
fine crashes have gone basic
functionality works it's like the system
has gone from a pre-release set of
software in an alpha stage to a proper
finalized driver that's been tested by
more than two people so it's pretty
great in terms of performance amy has
claimed this is where users should see
big improvements over the launch drivers
specifically 17% average performance
gains in eSports titles when comparing
driver versions 17.4 to 19.2 3 however
all my previous testing was done with
version 17.7 not the older 17.4 so let's
see how the difference is compared there
with 49 I recorded a 5% improvement to
average frame rates and no improvement
to 1% was with my 17.7 driver data
coming from runs where the game did not
randomly underclock the GPU a 5%
improvement is good it's nothing to
complain about but it's certainly not a
huge update the big improvement is that
you're now going to get maximum
performance every time you boot the game
and not a random water of varying
performance and the GPU still provides a
good experience at 1080p with low
settings when testing csgo there was no
difference in performance before and
after the driver update this is another
game that runs well on the rise and 520
500 you but don't expect a performance
improvement performance is much better
in Civilization 6 increasing by 15%
which is certainly up there with only 17
percent improvement claims for a game
that I think is well suited to a laptop
form factor getting up near the 60 FPS
mark in intensive scenarios at native
1080p is a pretty good result with GTA 5
are so no difference in average before
it's but a handy increase in 1% low
performance that allows the game to run
slightly smoother in general while you
will still have to play on the lower
settings performance is respectable from
a low-power APU Metro last light is the
most punishing game I tested despite
being an older game at this point it's
also the final game that we use for our
ultrabook game testing sweet average
perform is decreased by around 9% which
was disappointing to see however this
was compensated for with a large
improvement to 1% Louis allowing the
game to run more smoothly battery life
is another thing I want to mention
Verizon mobile was never amazing from a
battery life perspective an early system
is tended to have a strange idle clock
behavior such as idling too high on the
GPU but that's now been resolved which
in a few battery benchmarks resulted in
up to a 7% improvement nothing amazing
but I was surprised to see an
improvement at all over all these
drivers definitely do bring a number of
improvements before words is probably
the least exciting improvement here most
steps in games either saw zero
improvements are only minor gains there
were a few outliers notably blender and
Civilization six that saw gains around
15% but I don't think it's reasonable to
expect games like that in general a
small improvement is still an
improvement though the more important
improvements come in the form of
stability and bug fixes almost every
show I had with rise in mobile whether
that was crashes incompatibilities or
other problems has now been resolved
apps that didn't work previously now
work games are much more stable and
deliver more consistent performance it's
not perfect there are still issues with
things like lamenting premiere and a few
apps still do hang or crash more often
than I would expect but overall this has
been a significant step forward one
thing I haven't mentioned yet is support
for some of ambe's driver features that
are accessible on discrete GPU such as
Reliv unfortunately that's not available
yet which will disappoint a few people
however these drivers are still a work
in progress
and it seems AMD spent most of their
efforts here on stability and
performance with features to come later
and I guess that's part of the beauty of
this new driver ecosystem for rising
mobile we won't have to wait months for
a new GPU driver for their laptop abused
we should expect monthly updates in line
with their desktop cards like with their
discreet GPUs over time I expect bugs to
be patched features to get added and
performance to improve
of course the sudden you promise at this
stage but we'll have to wait and see how
this all plays out and I am expecting
things to definitely improve over the
coming months sure you have taken Amy
this long to get their act together on
rise and mobile drivers definitely not
but at least they have and as the rise
in mobile platform grows this shouldn't
be as much of an issue as it was for
early adopters that's it for this one an
X update on rising mobile will hopefully
be checking out new 3000 series laptops
in the next few months I'm not expecting
to see massive performance improvements
but it will be interesting to see how
the minor speck bump stacks up against
Intel of course you can subscribe for
more reviews consider supporting us on
patreon and I'll catch you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
