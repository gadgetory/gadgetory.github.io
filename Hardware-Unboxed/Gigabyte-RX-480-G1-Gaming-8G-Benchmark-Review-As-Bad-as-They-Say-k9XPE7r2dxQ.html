480 g1 gaming graphics card on the
channel and quite a few of you been
begging for a review ever since so today
I'm delivering you that review and if
you remember two weeks ago I looked at
the very impressive MSI R X 480 gaming
x8 G MSI's gaming X version offered
vastly improved thermal strong
performance that didn't suffer from any
throttling and a quiet operating volume
unfortunately overclocking wasn't great
but we've come to expect that with this
latest generation AMD and NVIDIA GPUs
apart from the disappointing
overclocking the only other issue is the
price right now it still costs $290
which is well above the $240 MSRP though
to be fair the cheapest ballpark the
card of seeing cost 260 dollars for the
power color Red Devil Down Under we're
paying at least 370 dollars though the
vast majority are priced over 400 the
gigabyte our X 480 g1 gaming comes at a
slightly more wallet-friendly 270 US and
in Auslan that translates to 430 bucks
currently gigabytes gtx 1060 g1 gaming
is also selling for 270 US or 450 ozu so
some stiff competition can be found at
this price point having already looked
at the GTX 1060 g1 gaming and extreme
gaming graphics cards both of which are
very impressive I might add
despite some hefty price premiums I'm
keen to check out how the our X 480 g1
gaming shapes up so let's take a closer
look at our test subject shall we the RX
480 g1 gaming is a relatively compact
graphics card measuring just 232
millimeters long and 116 millimeters
tall since it's a dual slot card it
measures 40 millimeters wide it has to
be said this looks more like a basic
windforce graphics card rather than a g1
gaming model the card is wrapped in a
black plastic fan shroud with orange
highlights it feels a little cheap and
flimsy though it will be more than
durable enough to serve its purpose
attach the shroud or a pair of 90
millimeter fans using gigabytes blade
fin design the side of the shroud which
typically faces outwards sports 90 be
backlit gigabyte logo and fan stop logo
something I noticed right away was just
how light this graphics card is
although it is much smaller than the msi
car we looked at a few weeks ago it's
still actually lighter than I was
expecting
in total the card weighs 715 grams which
sounds quite hefty until you realize
that the msi card weighs almost an
entire kilo at 970 9 grams making it
almost 40% heavier
pulling the cooler off reveals that the
g1 gaming cooler weighs 400 15 grams
itself so it accounts for almost 60% of
the cards total weight the MSI gaming X
cooler weighs 5 min 6 grams mini and
accounts for a little over 50% of the
cards total weight the difference being
the msi is gone with a much larger PCB
along with a huge heat spreader on the
front side of the graphics card covering
the memory chips and power circuitry
still gigabyte of working with almost
20% less metal so it'll be interesting
to see how this impacts the cards
ability to dissipate heat the coolers
are pretty basic affair featuring a
single array of aluminium heat sinks
measuring 205 millimeters long 70
millimeters wide and just 18 millimeters
tall gigabyte is gone with a cheap
aluminium baseplate though they do use
smooth direct contact copper heat pipes
to try and maximize thermal extraction
there are three six millimeter copper
heat pipes in total along with the R X
480 GPU this same cooler is also used to
take care of the 8 gddr5 memory chips as
well as the 6 plus 2 power phases that's
a serious amount of combined thermal
output that this little heatsink has to
deal with as is expected from Aalborg
partners gigabyte has included an 8 PN
PCIe power connector to ensure the card
doesn't over draw from the PCIe slot
though gigabyte does appear to have gone
a bit lighter on the cooling they've
still included a nice full sized back
plate to protect the rear side of the
graphics card around at the io end we
find three display ports a single HDMI
output and a dual link DVI output and
worse I went with a more VI friendly
setup by offering two HDMI outputs but I
don't have an issue with the
configuration power in this card ok so
Before we jump to the benchmarks let's
just quickly tell clock speeds the
reference clock speeds see the arcs 480
operated up to 12 66 megahertz gigabytes
blown the lid off that increasing the
ceiling by 1.8 9% to 1290 megahertz
still I can't get gigabyte to much of a
hard time here
MSI with their big
beefy cooler only went to 1303 megahertz
anyway the memory has been left 2,000
megahertz so don't expect to see any
real gains over the AMD reference card
for the most part overclocking which was
attempted using both what man and MSI
Afterburner with various over and under
voltage settings again resulted in a
maximum stable overclock speed of 13
hundred and 60 megahertz I was able to
gain for 30 to 60 minutes at 13 70
megahertz and even 13 80 megahertz the
system would eventually crash I'm not
interested in overclock so that a good
to write a set of benchmarks with failed
to provide 100% stability after an hour
more of gameplay so by far the majority
of my time on these reviews is found
finding the maximum stable overclock
anyway let's get on with the benchmarks
starting with Star Wars Battlefront we
find as expected the g1 gaming is able
to hang with the game e^x making a few
frames faster than our reference card
Far Cry primal sees the g1 gaming match
the msi card exactly along with the
stock r9 390 again it was a few frames
faster than the AMD reference our X 480
card again the g1 gaming matched the
bigger fatter gaming X card with 47 FPS
on average when testing with Mirror's
Edge catalyst of 1440p the our X 480
board partner cards have really
delivered in Tom Clancy's the division
again gigabyte is able to match the MSI
card with 49 fps making both cards
slightly faster than the stock GTX 1060
this time in the witcher 3 the partner
RX 4 ID cards matched the stock gtx 1060
with 44 FPS and once again the g1 gaming
hung in there of the gaming x card
overwatch has been used to showcase our
overclock as unimpressive as it is at 13
60 megahertz the maximum stable
overclock we achieve managed a 5% bump
in frame rate this is in line with a 5%
increase in clock speed over the factory
overclocked power consumption was on par
the MSI gaming X card as we saw a total
system consumption of 285 watts this is
comparable to the hrs Radeon r9 390 and
I know nano the g1 gaming has been able
to hang with the gaming apps for the
majority of our tests but this result is
a real letdown
remember we discovered that the gigabyte
card is 20% less metal in which to
dissipate heat well here's the result of
that downgrade the g1 gaming runs 9
degrees
ha-ah reaching 80 degrees making it just
a single degree cooler than the AMD
reference card thankfully unlike the
reference cards g1 gaming did remain
very quiet even under full lobe and
operating at 80 degrees that said when
overclocked the fans did certainly spin
up to an audible level so not not ideal
graphics card for overclockers I've
noticed gigabyte have been copying a lot
of flack over the past week or so
regarding the performance of the RX for
adg-1 gaming graphics card as you might
expect the operating temperature has
been front and center of the drama I
think at this point it's pretty much
unanimous that the reference card
doesn't put the RX 480 in the best
possible light and well by that I mean
it sucks there are a few issues with the
reference card but essentially it boils
down to the fact that runs hot loud and
doesn't overclock worth a damn sadly the
g1 gaming only improves on one of these
things the operating volume as it's
genuinely quiet of course the problem
being it still runs bloody hot MSI
however managed to create a model that
not only runs very quietly but also much
cooler than a DS reference card
still it's not all bad news gigabyte are
currently selling the g1 gaming for
twenty US dollars less granted this is
less than a 10% saving but for those on
a tight budget that could make all the
difference that said I would be very
motivated to pay the slight premium for
the card that ensures much lower
operating temperatures overall I don't
feel the gigabyte RX 480 g1 gaming is
nearly as bad as some are making out yes
it does run relatively hard but for
those that just want an affordable
graphics card to stick in their machine
and forget about the g1 gaming does fit
the bill you certainly aren't
sacrificing any frame rate performance
though if you intend to overclock then
we suggest looking for an alternate
option with graphics card such as the
power color red devil on offer for even
less money it really does make a
difficult to recommend the g1 gaming
model at the current asking price so
what do you guys think of this gen one
gaming card is it one you pick up
yourself let me know in the comments I'm
