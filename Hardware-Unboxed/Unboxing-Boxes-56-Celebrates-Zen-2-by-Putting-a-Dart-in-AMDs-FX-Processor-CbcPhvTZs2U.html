sorry from a little quieter than usual
I'm just a little bit intimidated right
now over to my right here these are the
boxes that we have to unbox I can't
actually easily fit them all in the shop
but there's a lot of boxes there so
normally we do five we've probably got
over 20 so yeah there's gonna be some
mega jump cuts in this one this is gonna
be filmed quite differently to the usual
unboxing unboxers not going to do many
product overviews or first impression
things we're just going to rip them out
the box hey we have this and move on if
there's anything that I don't think I'll
get too quickly on the channel we'll
we'll go over that in a little bit more
detail but things that I think I'm going
to be reviewing or featuring on the
channel Linux few weeks to the next
month we'll just show you the box and
move on okay so let's get into it
box number one okay kind of an inch it's
very heavy box kind of interesting box
looks like there's a lot of a soos and
Tim dirt maybe I'll grab the stuff out
we'll quickly look at these boxes and
we'll move on okay we have the isuzu ROG
Thor power supply the Platinum 850 watt
I will be doing an all a soos build soon
so as sue said they could send over a
whole heap of hardware for that if we
were interested it sounds pretty good to
me for storage we have a team group
Delta R so that or Delta s rather that's
all they've got a tough gaming themed
SSD so that makes sense and then we've
got some tough themed T Force memory so
what do we got here six thinking about
kids sales 16 ddr4 3200 so that's pretty
good stuff and it looks like we'll be
doing an intel build for this one
because we have a z3 90 plus or tough
tough Zed 390 plus a gaming Wi-Fi
motherboard so yeah you'll see that in
the building soon I won't bother taking
that
box but we've got a motherboard what
looks to be probably a pretty overkill
power supply for that build extremely
heavy box you'll see that in the build
then we have the right year the rog ryu
probably getting that wrong and it looks
to be a 240 millimeter all you own the
liquid cooler so very cool and then we
have a phoenix gtx 1660 graphics card
and this is actually really cool this is
probably the thing I want the most out
of that build the other stuff looks good
but I'm came to when I was planning on
buying a whole heap of 1650s when they
come out but maybe I can buy a couple of
other base models 1660s and show you
guys how the base models compared to the
high-end models so yeah that's something
I've been wanting to do for a while I
was gonna use my patreon money for that
but anyway I have the base model phoenix
card from a soos so that'll be going in
that bill it's gonna be an interesting
build sort of a seems to be a mismatch
of components on the surface there but
we'll make it work
it should be good fun so there'll be an
upcoming video anyway I'll move this
stuff off and we'll get another box and
we'll just keep getting you know it
bella box okay that box had six fans
from ends and XT and might need your
help on this one as well they're the GB
- yep anyway there's three 140
millimeter fans and there's three 120
millimeter fans and they are designed
for the hue - so I reckon there's
probably some more NZXT stuff in that
mega pile of boxes because it would be
weird for them just to send me six fans
so I'll move them off to the side there
and we'll keep hunting through the boxes
okay
little box here we'll see what's inside
the little box we have a scythe cooler
and it is the why can't I think just
have a really easy to pronounce name
think it's the mutant five not quite
sure on that one it has a big fan
and a big heat sink and it's designed
for pretty much every platform but TR
for I think obviously it's an air cooler
120 millimeter fan out and there is the
beefy heat sink there where we got one
two three four five six it looks like we
have six Joule heat pipes that go
through an aluminium fin are a fairly
small baseplate there so you wouldn't
want to use that on any really big
processors but your mainstream chipset
had probably worked well with probably
feature this in a build test it out in
the not-too-distant future
okay package chief from Logitech it's
extremely heavy this one so no idea what
we've got in here maybe two assortment
of products not quite sure one big heavy
box really please oh it's going it's
going
put me out of my misery
okay we have the Logitech G 560 s I
think I've had these sitting in a box in
my house since probably last year so
sorry about that Logitech it kind of got
lost you know all the packages but
anyway it's a it's a set of speakers it
looks like it's a 2.1 it incorporates
some kind of light sync technology and
yeah whoever will have a quick look at
the speakers I might set them up by the
end of the episode more play some music
for the outro we'll see how we go for
time we've got a fair waterboxxes to get
through still actually that's just got a
whole lot of packaging let's move on i'm
a deal with that towards the end of the
episode if we have time I'll put this
off to the side sorry for bailing on
that last one we really just time is not
on our side with this episode
we're going for an unboxing boxes record
some interesting packaging here not sure
that was all about
maybe someone's trolling me okay well
it's not more NZXT stuff this is
BitFenix so we've got some RGB
accessories some addressable GBA LED
light strips so it's probably more of
that story as well so put that in the
pile I'm off we'll keep moving forward
ah
we actually have an interesting package
here that was sent to our P o box so
this is from a viewer most likely
probably an interesting package but
anyway will hell is this all about it
looks to be a dartboard why someone sent
me a dartboard I have no idea not in on
the jerky okay so we have a AMD FX
processors so someone has made me an AMD
FX dartboard because they know how much
I love AMD FX processes so that is
actually a very funny I don't know if
I'm gonna be able to sit this anywhere
I'll clear some space quickly oh just
beats by about a millimeter so there we
go let's uh start with the red darts I
think that seems appropriate
I have not thrown a dart in a long time
this could uh this could be dangerous
actually you know what I'm just going to
move my chair out of the way I'm only
about four meters away but I'm off to a
slight angle here okay we need a bit
more power more power we need even more
power the a bit FX is too strong well
there we go we've got a six hang on I
won't be satisfied until we have drilled
a hole in the AMD FX processor that was
pretty bad come on this episode may run
a lot longer I'm sort of throwing
downwards as well next to the camera
he's alright
I need to sharpen these dots oh oh it's
kind of its kind of managed to penetrate
the aim being a fix processes armor that
was sidearm oh yeah okay there we go I
got it
put one there okay well whoever sent
that thank you that's quite funny really
moving along okay we'll jump into a bag
for this one tear that apart okay we
have the deep cool MF 120s fans 3-pack
and we have the deep cool MF 120s fans
3-pack where we have two of those three
packs so I think that's six fans in
total yep I think I got that right and
so now we have six NZXT fans six deep
cool fans and three BitFenix RGB LED
light strips I'm not sure what we're
working towards here but yeah I think I
have some b-roll of these guys so if I
do Steve
editing Steve throw it up now hopefully
you weren't just staring at me staring
at the camera hopefully hopefully I
found that barrel okay moving right
along box these speed unboxings it's a
serious sport what do we have here what
do we have here
more NZXT stuff cat mouse pad oK we've
got everything here we have got
absolutely everything
get out of here box with your rubbish
okay we could have just done an end the
next east speed unboxing the way this is
going okay this looks suspiciously like
a mousepad while the mouse pads getting
really dirty so maybe you can do some
protection work mousepad hat feels a bit
small for my head but how's that look if
I unbox this cap correctly good I was
hoping so okay we have an under Glo
accessory so I believe that's like an
LED light strip it's a fancy fancy name
for an LED light strip again that's for
the hue to need the elusive future and
we have a cable comb accessory that
looks like it also has some sort of RGB
lighting and that works with the hue as
well what do we have here we have the
hue tune so this is the RGB lighting kit
controller thingy majiggy kind of like
Corsairs node so we've got that we have
the z2 370 motherboard I don't know if
I've got the Zed 390 version out by now
I think they may have if they do and I
end up doing ends at it and zxt build
then maybe that would be a better board
to use to anyway it's a good looking
board I think it's made by ECS so so
anyway moving along we have a massive X
72 Kraken X 72 3 and 16 millimeter all
in one liquid cooler so that'll go
nicely in a case I suppose that will
support it and we have another hue to
ambient RGB lighting kit so yeah I've
got that then we have an x XL NZXT
t-shirt so I don't know whether to be
offended or not buy that XXL maybe it's
maybe it's asian sizes I'm not sure in
which case I might be in XXL but all
them just a large okay all right
and we have a hoodie here which also
looks and well this is just a large
hoodie what we'll try the hoodie out how
do I break that dressing room music
please holy moly
yeah I mean that just fits I'd call that
more of a medium than a large but it
fits it's a bit snug a bit tight around
the old arms and whatnot but yeah I like
it looks pretty cool
looks pretty pretty snazzy yep yep good
it's maybe the double XL t-shirt is what
I'd require anyway well we won't try
that on cuz this is a speed unboxing we
don't have time for getting changed more
than once I think you guys get the idea
well thank you for all that year ends
and XT hopefully I'll be able to do a
build soon except I'm already running
out of space we have another sample this
one is for Steve Walton so looks like I
made this the right place
oh it was heavier than I was expecting
okay what do we got here
formula gold 750 watt is this BitFenix
who is this who makes it is bit Fink's
they're little sir a logo on the front I
think they're anyway this one up here so
it is a bit Phoenix power supply so
we've got some LED light strips and our
power supplies out there okay I don't
need to be in shock for this one we'll
open it up most likely we have a case on
our hands here
I've made a big mess in office love to
say it
okay it wasn't just a polystyrene bomb
it was actually the matrix 70 from deep
cool so that is a pretty neat standard
ATX case tempered glass side panel looks
like we've got a glass front panel so
that will be interesting there for
airflow but we'll look into that
probably going to do a building this at
some stage on the channel so anyway
that's the case moving on small box to
relax with get a bit of a breather oh
well it looks like we have six 120
millimeter RGB addressable fans this
time from BitFenix so we have six six
six hmm right well we'll just put that
aside and hope for the best I think okay
we have the NZXT H 700 I don't think we
need to take other box you guys are
possibly in this case I will be doing a
bill with it at some point so yeah we've
got a case with all the rest of our NZXT
stuff and we have another case this one
from MSI mpg Gungan er don't yep I'll
work on that it's yeah it's another case
we'll move on
okay we have the fractal design define
s2 vision yep it's another computer case
okay moving on
I've really got to work on my case
cardio damn okay so we have another case
this one has sort of a fabric II kind of
handle on top that says tough gaming
kind of cool it has a a standard
tempered glass window what they call see
me that here you guys yeah I mean
there's a reasonable amount of
ventilation it's a steel front panels
that's kind of neat
it's actually a really cool looking case
this really liked the look of it it's
got three fans and standard in the front
140 in the back it looks like three 120
s or maybe they're 140 s in the front
yeah I'll be doing all that other Seuss
hardware so we'll be going in this case
in a bill real soon so well it's been
too much time on it yeah it's a really
it's a surprisingly cool in case I have
to say
okay the last big case up in Centennial
a full-size ATX case is the BitFenix
endzone mesh we've seen we built the
Enzo in Matt's PC a while ago Matt came
back and we built him a new rig and that
one in the Enzo
now if the Enzo mesh so better air flow
and all that probably you're building
this as well on the channel in the near
future
okay we'll open just one of these these
are doctors amber cases they're their
century 2.0 they've sent me out two of
these quite a few youtubers have already
shown this particular case off it is
very impressive I saw a great video from
one of my favorite youtubers Paul from
Paul's Hardware also Kyle at bit wet he
did a cool video I think Leo's over ufd
tech did a couple and yeah there's quite
a few videos of it already but I think
actually we're getting down we'll get
out of the box before I do any thinking
I'll do my best thinking once things are
unboxed saying a lot okay
century 2.0 getting unboxed oh wise
there little stickers here as well some
nice foam really cool plastic sort of
bag that it's in tin case and then
there's a whole lot of accessories like
a really cool screwdriver in here you
got your stand whole heap of stuff we
won't gobble all of that now because
I'll do that in the build video but
hopefully won't take too long here too
so the case comes in that neat little
carry bag pop it out and this is the
gray version so that in the other box we
have the black version I believe it is
so we've got a kind of a cool industrial
kind of gray version here yeah it looks
very very nice so keen to do a build in
this what I'm thinking is I don't know
if this will happen so no promises but
since we've got two of these this year
two Computex I would like to take a mini
ITX or a slim compact build rather than
the laptops that we've done for last two
years because laptops it is slow loud
and yeah I think we can make something
more powerful and more impressive in
something like this so maybe I'll do a
build video for Tim and I to myself new
Computex rigs mini ITX slim rigs so yeah
anyway that's a possibility see how we
go for time we have about two months
before we're leaving for Computex so
yeah okay really really neat-looking
case this from a DHL bag comes TNT
bubble wrap okay we have the new deep
cool captain 240 Pro this thing is lit
it in RGB and it has some pretty cool
features over the previous version one
of them is the automatic pressure
adjustment so basically when you get a
few temperature increases and things
like that the liquids do expand and
whatnot and to stop that from causing
the all-in-one liquid cooler to burst at
the seam it will adjust for pressure so
I think deep cooler making an extremely
bold claim that this will never leak
that it's it's leak proof so yeah for an
all-in-one liquid cool that would be
exceptional if that is the case but
anyway that will be going in a build
like everything else at some point in
the future and that to my surprise was
actually the last box actually I'll just
go check and make sure because there's a
there's a whole lot of rubbish right now
I won't show you it the it's quite
embarrassing the mess I've made okay so
this is normally the part of the video
where I quickly recap over the five or
six products that we unboxed and give my
last impressions of them we're not gonna
do that this time I think we're just
gonna go well that was that was
something I'm not really sure what that
was but you guys have been asking for
unboxing uh boxes episode so this is
kind of one where I'm boxed a hell of a
lot of boxes not not many products but a
lot of boxes so hopefully is satisfied
anyway thank you for watching this
episode of whatever this was
and normal content will resume tomorrow
on the channel thanks for watching I'm
your host Steve I'll see you again next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
