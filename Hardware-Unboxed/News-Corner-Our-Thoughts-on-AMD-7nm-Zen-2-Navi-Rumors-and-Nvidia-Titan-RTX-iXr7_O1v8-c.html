news corner on this hot summer in
Australian Day today's episode is
probably a little different from some of
the usual episodes we do and now we're
only going to talk about two topics the
recent slate of leaks relating to Amy's
upcoming products and invidious new
Titan r-tx will be giving a few of our
thoughts on these things throughout this
video so a bit of the news pinions
episode or something like that so we're
going to start with the AMD rumors
because there's a lot of stuff to cover
and a lot of you guys have been asking
for opinions on it all of this
information first appeared in a video
from Jim over at a dog TV who has leaked
a few things in the past and let's just
say these rumors have sent our tech
enthusiast into a bit of a whirlwind
this week I think the Navi related GPU
rumors are probably the best point to
start the basics for these rumors are
this AMD is allegedly planning to
release an RX 30 80 RX 30 70 and rx 30
60 based on their upcoming Navi
architecture the RX 30 80 will be about
15% faster than Vega 64 at 150 watts
allowing it to compete with the RT X
2070 and it will be priced at $250 the
RX 37 t will be around Vega 56
performance for $200 and the RX 36 t
will be 75 watts at a hundred and thirty
dollars and it will compete with the GTX
1060 now at first glance this sounds
amazing
at $250 GP from AMD competing with a
$500 GPU from Nvidia that sounds well I
guess it sounds too good to be true and
basically that's because it is this
rumour simply fails the common sense
test on a number of grounds so let's go
through and cover them all I guess I'll
start with the pricing here firstly
companies do not set pricing this far
ahead of launch even if we're talking
about a full unveil at CES that show is
roughly a month away and there's simply
no way a company has finalized pricing a
month in advance it just does not happen
it's actually quite common for us to
receive a GPU or CPU under MDA maybe a
week in advance and it will only be a
few days before launch that pricing is
actually finalized and given to us
people in the industry have mentioned to
us that typically though pricing is too
so about a week before launch for most
products while these sorts of products
are designed around you know rough price
targets for example in a mid-range
high-end enterprise that sort of thing
the products themselves are typically
finalized without an exact price point
in mind the company would then figure
out how much the product will cost to
make based on yields and potential
binning though then factoring a margin
and then only decide on a price near
launch after also factoring in current
market conditions so while it's not out
of the question to have rough
specifications finalized well before
launch pricing and even final clock
speeds and that sort of thing often
aren't decided until much closer to the
actual release then for these GPUs the
pricing simply does not make any sense
from a number of angles AMD may want to
undercut in video with a next generation
of GPUs that would make sense you know
they've done that sort of thing in the
past but no sane company would choose to
create a product and sell it for half
the price of their only other competitor
so now opinion it's completely
ridiculous to suggest ambi will release
a navvy GPU at two hundred and fifty
dollars that delivers performance
equivalent to invidious $500 RTX 2070 it
makes zero business sense and no
executive at AMD would ever sign off on
pricing like that if a company wanted to
undercut its competitors you maybe be
looking at a 20% lower price at best so
that would mean AMD competing with an RX
2070 equivalent for around $400 that
would sound reasonable
but AMD isn't going to sacrifice juicy
margins just for the sake of destroying
in video or whatever they're a business
they want to make money so they're going
to price their products with current
market conditions in mind but that's not
the only thing that makes no sense
AMD literally just released their Radeon
rx 590 at two hundred and eighty dollars
and now we have a leak suggesting they
will announce a product in a month that
is twice as fast at a lower price that's
just completely out of little OOD Icarus
the only thing about this GPU leak that
makes even the remotest sense is the TDP
and memory configuration perhaps the
naming as well though I'm not sure any
of it is true AMD is publicly stated
that seven nanometers is allowing the
company to produce products that deliver
the same performance at half the power
consumption so further suppose at rx 30
77 nanometers should allow AMD to create
a product that performs around the
same level as the 210 watt Vega 56 120
watts for pricing it at $200 yeah I'm
not sure about that one then we have the
third-generation risin products this
leak talks about ten separate products
ranging from the risin three 3300 up to
the rise in 938 50x you'd think AMD
might go with a naming scheme like that
so I guess we're off to a good start
mostly CPUs Sandler there within the
realm of possibility inch level parts
getting a bump up to six cores and
twelve threads rise and five reportedly
becomes eight cores and 16 threads rise
in seven goes up to 12 cores and 24
threads then rise in nine comes in
offering 16 cores and 32 threads these
designs are suggested to use AMD's 40
nanometer IO die in conjunction with one
or two seven animators and two dies
which again would make sense going on
what AMD has shown for the upcoming
server products but when you look a
little closer again things don't really
line up take this one example the rise
in 730 700 X this is claimed to be a 12
core part with a 4.2 gigahertz base
clock 5 gigahertz boost and 105 watt TDP
you look across the rest of the table
yeah I guess that looks reasonable on
face value but back with second
generalizing the Rison 720 700 X was
also a 105 watt part but this time only
included 8 cores a base clock of 3.7
gigahertz and a max boost of 4.3
gigahertz
so this leak is essentially claiming
that third gen risin is providing for
extra cores
plus an additional 500 megahertz on the
base clock within the same 105 watt
power n voice so 50% more cores and a
14% higher base clock now we have to
remember when AMD said it there's an to
unveil the seven nanometers is allowing
them to achieve upwards of one point two
five times the performance at the same
power consumption so does it sound
realistic that AMD would be able to put
in 50% more cause and clock them or 14%
higher within the same TDP the TDP is I
guess never been a great metric and
nobody's previous rise in line ups have
also a few oddities but I could list
several more strange things about this
lab that just don't sound right when
measuring up the clock speeds and Teddy
pace and
aligned with what AMD has done in the
past like how there's a 4 gigahertz 8
core chip in this lineup at 95 watts but
then a 16 cord ship at 4.3 gigahertz and
that's only 135 watts the clock speed
increase and the core increase doesn't
seem to be matching the TDP there as
well it's just not adding up to me but
on top of that there's one key part of
the CPU that makes the least sense and
that's the unveiled date at sea yes and
I guess this also applies to the GPU
lineup as well which is supposedly going
to be unveiled at CES as well at this
point I think a lot of people are
expecting a and B to do a big unveil of
these products CES considering CEO Lee
Suh will be on stage talking about seven
nanometer products but from what we are
hearing that simply isn't the case and
by from what we're hearing I actually
mean from what we're not hearing
whenever AMD releases a new lineup of
CPUs or GPS that host a tech day where
all the enthusiasts mean together to
learn about these new products it's at
these events we usually hear about the
products in detail and there's you know
several NDA dates afterwards for
announcements reviews and so forth this
is the way ambi has been operating for
the last few years at least so far there
is no planned tech day for AMD at CES in
fact at last year's CES AMD did host a
tech day it's where they announced the
Rison apu lineup and a few new rise in
mobile SKUs but we heard about that
event as early as September so nearly 4
months ahead of time which is fairly
typical for planning these sorts of
trips so if there was a tech day we
would have heard about it by now
AMD are planning a few small things that
CES this year there will be a press
reception and some meetings available
you know typical sort of things that
these major events but if there's no
tech day you can take it to the bank
that there won't be a major unveil of a
full product liner now it's likely that
Lisa sue will take the stage at CES and
announce something considering they have
this big keynote to talk seven animators
blood only be expecting a product teaser
at this stage and here's another example
for what I made at Computex 2018 AMD did
not host a tech day but they had a press
conference there they announced second
gen thread Ripper but only talked about
a handful of specs near 12 nanometers up
to 32 cores and some ballpark specs
there were no official product names
there were no finalized SKUs
spec's and there were certainly no
prices I think that's the sort of thing
we can expect at CES not some massive
unveil of an entire lineup of cpus and
gpus with pricing specs and everything
else finalized on top of that ambi has
already said and reiterated that the
first seven nanometers n2 products will
be their second generation epic CPUs
which haven't been officially launched
yet so it's unlikely that we'll see a
full third gen rise and unveil until
after 2nd gen epic is unveiled and by
unveiled I mean the full lineup of SKUs
you know all the specs pricing and
everything for that so this has been a
lot of discussion on the one topic but
there's just a lot of things about this
leak that failed the common sense test
don't align with Amy's previous stated
claims don't align with what AMD has
done in the past and simply don't fit in
with what we know about AMD's release
timeline for the next couple of months
well I stopped I'm going to have a quick
discussion about the Titan r-tx which
Nvidia officially unveiled earlier this
week after a few suspicious product
placements from a few top influences in
case you missed it it's a $2,500
graphics card that uses a fully unlocked
churring tu1 or two GPU so it comes with
the full complement of 4608 cuda cores
576 tenths of course and 72 RT cause in
comparison the artex 2080 Ti is cut down
slightly with 4352 two cores clock
speeds are similar to the 20 atti
founders Edition at 13 50 megahertz
based though it has a higher boost clock
up to 17 70 megahertz you're also
getting 24 gigabytes of gddr5 4-bit bus
for 672 gigabytes per second of
bandwidth and everything comes with a
280 watt TDP the Titan ITX isn't a
really interesting position in the
market in a video sort of positions this
as a gaming card claiming it's the
fastest single GP on the market and all
that stuff but at $2,500 it's really not
going to be on the radar of most gamers
especially when the 2080 TI is already
out and available for $1200 we're
looking at around 15% more performance
than the 2080 I for more than double the
price so yeah not something game is
going to rush out and buy this leaves
the Titan X is more of a workstation or
can
focus card but when you look at the
specifications it's a bit weird yes it
has 24 gigabytes of vram and more single
precision and tensor compute performance
than its predecessor the Titan V as well
as more memory bandwidth at the same
time you aren't getting a half rate
double precision compute like you get
with the Titan V instead double
precision compute is cut down
considerably
this makes the Titan V still faster for
double precision workloads so someone
interested in a Titan RTX would need to
be after a car with lots of VRAM but not
for FP 64 workloads if you want FP 64
performance you should go for the Titan
V but then you miss out on the large
amount of memory and compute performance
in other areas isn't as good to get the
best of both worlds you need the Quadro
gb 100 as even in videos Quadra RT x
cards don't offer half rate double
precision but then a tight 90 x-pyr
would also need to not be interested in
the certifications you get from Quadro
cards the different line of drivers or
ECC memory support which are all reasons
to buy GPU like the more expensive
Quadra RT x 6000 so yeah like past titan
launches the Titan HX is a strange one I
think its value to buyers has been
dampened a fair bit with the 28 each eye
laundering before the Titan RT X usually
the Titan card comes first that interest
you know few games with deep pockets
then later we get a high in Ti model
that's a more reasonable price but
there's really no incentive for gamers
to buy it and for workstations it's a
pretty niche product compared to Nvidia
squadra and volta offerings anyway
that's basically it for this week's news
corner just two topics covered but I
really wanted to dig into the amb rumors
because they're blowing up and I think
people are getting a little bit ahead of
themselves honestly these sorts of
rumors aren't good for the industry at
hypes people hype for mythical products
and when the real products are unveiled
people can get disappointed because it's
not as awesome if the leaks suggested it
would be and that can even be the case
when the products are still good value
good products in their own right so
that's why we tend not to focus on
rumors too much you can subscribe to get
