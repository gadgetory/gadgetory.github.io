for another episode of what does it take
to play previously we looked at what
kind of hardware gamers need to play
dirt for at 1080p and maintain over 60
FPS at all times the focus here is on
new hardware so we went with the pentium
g 45 60 and Radeon rx 5 70 and that
combo delivered very impressive results
for those of you unfamiliar with this
series the point is to quickly show
gamers in five minutes or less what kind
of hardware they need to achieve a set
performance criteria in this case we
want to play destiny 2 at 1440p and
maintain around 60 FPS for the most part
Justin you too as a brand new toddler
just hit beta status and I have to say
the game looks amazing developer Bungie
recommends gamers ensure their systems
packing at least 2 geforce gtx 970 or
radeon are 390 and for the cpu a core i5
2400 or horizon 5 1600 x currently i'm
testing around 30 GPUs in destiny 2 up
to P 1440p and 4k using the higher
quality preset so I've already got a
pretty good idea of what kind of
performance gamers are looking at with a
varied range of hardware for those
wanting a game at 1440p I found that
Bungie are right on the money as I found
both the GTX 970 r9 390 deliver a great
experience pushing over 50 FPS at all
times and often hovering around 70 FPS
and of course this is with the high
quality preset for a similar experience
though on modern hardware the three
gigabyte version of the gtx 1060 works
very well in this title as i'm about to
show you
unfortunately though please be aware
whenever i enabled the on-screen
statistics the game would crash after
about 60 seconds or so and then I would
have to restart the single-player
tutorial from the start so unfortunately
I do have very limited footage with all
the information up on the screen and you
know I realized that's quite
disappointing before we get into that
though here is a look at the quality
settings used for now I've avoided using
the highest preset which uses msaa and I
found the impact on performance was
massive while the improvement in quality
really wasn't noticeable so with the
high preset enabled the anti-aliasing
mode is said to SMA an HD IO screen
space ambient
is used I found that with most of the
graphics cards tested even the ultra
high-end models dropping down from the
highest quality preset to the high
quality preset improved frame rates by
over 80% and like I said there was
really no noticeable difference in image
quality the GTX 1063 gigabyte wasn't
much slower than the six gigabyte model
and even at 1440p there were no missing
textures or issues with the
single-player toriel which looked
amazing I might add as for the CPU the
developer recommends the horizon 5 1600
expert I found the exact same experience
with the horizon 3 1200 and that's
without overclocking the CPU so for this
what does it take to play episode I've
used the r3 1200 and GTX 1063 gigabyte
for the most part frame rates at 1440p
did stay above 60fps and the small pass
I was able to show before afterburner
caused the game to crash we saw a
minimum of 51 FPS and an average of 63
fps for those of you wondering the same
hardware combo was good for an average
of 102 FPS at 1080p with a minimum of 78
FPS for a game that looks this amazing
and isn't even released yet I have to
say destiny 2 appears extremely well
optimised for the PC at least that's
been my experience so far destiny 2 does
utilize core heavy CPUs very well and by
that I mean it spreads the load across
all physical cores very well and I've
seen this on the horizon 5 1600 and r7
1700 that said the game doesn't give the
CPU a huge amount of work so while the
work the CPU does have to do is balanced
across all the available calls very
nicely it's still not enough to
overwhelm a modern quad core at times
though the Rison 3 1200 did see CPU
utilization spiked at around 90% but for
the most part it was really hot ring
John around 60 to 70% looking at the
frame time data the game played
extremely smooth with the r3 1200 and
GTX 1063 gigabyte combo so this is what
I recommend gamers bring to the table
for playing destiny r2 and all of its
glory
at least with settings that make sense
are there any other games you'd like me
to check out with certain test criteria
such as targeted framerate quality
settings or resolution for example
anyway if so let me know
at section below and I'll do my best to
make that happen also keep an eye out
for the massive destiny to GPU
comparison coming in the next day or two
I'm your host Steve have fun gaming guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
