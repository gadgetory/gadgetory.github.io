i'm your host Matt and it's been a busy
few weeks to me after holiday in Vietnam
and Cambodia I hope you enjoyed the last
few videos that I filmed in advance but
now I'm back with something relatively
new md's radiant iron iron a no i won't
go into too much background behind the
fury line and the nano as it covered
this in detail in our fury nano preview
video there's only a few things you need
to know firstly the nanos the compact
card and the fury lineup coming in at
forty percent shorter than the reference
290x it features the same 4096 stream
processors as the furious but runs at a
lower average clock speed and thus
consumes around thirty six percent less
power because of this the Nano doesn't
require liquid cooling AMD is claiming
that the nana will be the fastest and
most power-efficient mini ITX card on
the market feeding the gtx 970 by thirty
percent we're going to test the two
resolutions for you guys now let's head
to the benchmark lab and find out if
AMD's claims are true first up we tested
far cry 4 which tends to favor the red
team at 4k the Nano amazed 36 frames per
second just one frame shy of the fury
three frames showed the tight necks and
six frames shy of the fury axe at 1440p
the nano produced 71 frames per second
again this was just one frame shy of the
fury and three frames shy of the tight
necks it edged out the 980 TI both
resolutions a feat we don't expect it to
repeat in any other games next up we
have GTA 5 a 4k this time the nano
managed 41 frames three friends behind
the 980 TI and the timex led the single
GPU pack the regular fury only managed
one frame per second higher again and
the fury ax managed four more frames the
Nano clocked 80 frames per second in GTA
at 40 and 40 p again only just trailing
the fury 980 TI and fury acts by a
fairly negligible
amount all five or less in battlefield
hardline the Nano produced to possibly
playable 36 frames per second on average
at 4k this one's again comparable to the
fury and just three frames shy but fury
ex battlefield hardline at 1440p was the
only time I saw the gtx 980 beat out the
r9 owner and the I no fury though not by
much all cards tested produced it
comfortably smooth 68 frames per second
or higher at 4k and thief the nano clock
36 frames per second this time edging
out the 980 TI by a couple of frames
consistently with our other test results
it was a single frame behind the fury
but only two frames behind the fury axe
and the tight next this time at 1440p
the rankings stayed the same the Nano
again edged out the 980 TI and was only
a little behind the fury fury axe and
tight next in thief watch dogs at 4k saw
the Nano produced 37 frames per second
right in its standard 4k ballpark and a
little behind its bigger brothers at
1440p 70 frames per second was enough to
hold its place over the gtx 980 and
again slide it in behind the fury fury
axe and high-end geforce cards in the
witcher the 4k resolution is pretty
unplayable with any single card set up
the Nano at self-managed is 25 frames
per second and was consistently behind
as longer rivals tested by the 390 x and
the gtx 980 in our final game test and
then I was able to make 50 frames per
second in the witcher 3 at 1440p this
was a single frame behind the fury three
frames behind the fury axe and six
frames behind the 980 TI as we mentioned
the unknown Nana was a very power
efficient card plugged into our gaming
system the entire setup consumed just
288 wats while scamming compared to 302
wats with the fury 318 wats with the 980
TI and 336 wats with the fury axe the
Nano is on the higher end of the
temperature scale when gaming compared
to its rivals and of course much hotter
than the fury X which is liquid cooled
we expect that the board partner models
with improved cooling systems will be
able to bring this figure down power
limit increase by 50% we're able to
squeeze an extra
frames per second out of the Nano at 4k
and battlefield hardline allowing it to
leapfrog the fury and fall just a frame
behind the fury acts in thief at 4k the
overclocked Nana was again able to
produce an extra two frames per second
bring it up to 38 frames per second also
4k watchdogs told the same tale with the
overclocked nano pumping out just an
extra two frames per second with the
power limit increased this again allowed
it to outperform the fury if only just
at 40 and 40 p the Nano again managed
next to two frames per second in
battlefield hardline so percentage-wise
you get a bigger performance increase in
battlefield at 4k resolutions 1440p
thief allowed us a three frames second
increase of the Nano overclocked this is
again enough to beat out of fury it but
not quite enough to jump in front of the
fury axe watch dogs at 1440p also
managed to three frame per second
increase 473 frames per second on
average compared to just 72 frames from
the standard clock fury and 74 frames
from the standard clock fury acts so as
you've now seen the Nano is only really
slightly slower than the full-sized
theory and it also managed to beat the
GeForce 980 at both resolutions tested
although unless you've specifically
after a very short graphics card for a
hundred fifty dollars less a strong case
can certainly be made for the 980
compared to the 980 TI it fell short
performance wise as expected but did
manage to be more power efficient which
is a plus with the nano and the 980 TI
come in at six hundred fifty dollars so
again we'd only really recommend the
nano to those who are really looking to
save space the 650 dollar price tag also
matches that of the fury x itself and
you saw the nano of course fall short of
its fully fledged big brother in our
tests obviously you sacrifice some
performance for the uniquely small form
factor however I think it's really tough
sell considering the fury ax is
reasonably small itself and fits into a
lot of mini ITX gaming cases already
granted you need to squeeze the radiator
in too but for the most part this is a
non-issue also once you factor in the
rear position of the 8-pin PCIe
connector the NATO isn't quite as small
as first thought in terms of
overclocking raising the clock speed
gave us no return and in some cases
actually slowed down the performance
slightly increasing the power limit
however
that the Nano was able to maintain
around 1000 megahertz clock speed and
boost performs the just about match the
fury ex temperatures weren't affected
too much hovering only a couple of
degrees higher than standard but the fan
speed and subsequent noise was higher
annoyingly and nano did produce quite a
lot of coil wire which is a real shame
and not something any 650 dollar
graphics card shouldn't suffer from so
come on please AMD no more squealing
graphics cards please after checking our
AMD's reference design of the Nano we're
optimistic about seeing some great
designs and performance from the boiler
partners with improved cooling setups
and increased power limits we could see
some production cards that match the
fury acts for performance All Things
Considered I think the Nano is certainly
a reprised it's not quite unique enough
to justify the price tag although it's
impressively small and efficient balk a
performance is potentially playable but
not sufficient to satisfy true
enthusiasts and the nano certainly
delivered a more enjoyable experience at
40 and 40 p overall the Nano is an
exceptional graphics card though
unfortunately it does suffer from a few
minor design flaws and ultimately a bad
asking price as always thanks for
watching another hardware on box review
i'm your host Matt and I'd love to hear
what you guys think to the know know in
the comments hit like hit subscribe and
we'll see you next time yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
