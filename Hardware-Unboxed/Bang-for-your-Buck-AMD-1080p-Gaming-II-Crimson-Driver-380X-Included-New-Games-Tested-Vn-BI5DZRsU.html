looked at 1080p gaming performance using
just AMD graphics cards with the aim to
determine which GPU in their current
lineup offered the best bang for their
bark at the most commonly used
resolution despite being what I felt was
an interesting comparison in hindsight
it was unfortunately poorly timed just
two weeks after the release of that
video md released another new sub $300
graphics card the r9 380 x and not only
that but a week later the new AMD
crimson suite was released offering a
flashy new user interface and even
better performance one would think AMD
might have timed the 380 x and crimson
driver released to coincide with one
another not only would this maximize the
impact of the 380 x but it would have
also better showcase their news user
interface it seems the more things
change is AMD the more things stay the
same but I digress so not only as AMD's
GPU line not changed but so too is the
performance if only slightly other
changes include more aggressive pricing
from both AMD and nvidia for the holiday
spending season well we have a new range
of game to test with as was the case
with the previous 1080p gaming video
we'll be focusing heavily on price
versus performance prices will be based
on what we can find at major US
retailers such as newegg.com and
therefore all prizes will be based on
the US currency ideally we'll be looking
for an average of 60 FPS though we
understand the sum game is one upwards
of 120 FPS for the 120 Hertz 144 hurts
gammy monitors the testing we've
selected nine games and almost all of
them are very new the list includes the
not so new battlefield 4 along with Tom
Clancy's Rainbow six siege Just Cause 3
star wars battlefront fallout 4 mad max
batman arkham knight call duty black ops
3 and game of the year the witcher 3
wild hunt for almost all of the games
fraps was used to measure framerate
performance and we recorded 90 seconds
of game play in each game the only game
where we didn't use fraps was very much
succeed as the built-in bench mark works
nicely finally all graphics cards use
with clocked according to the default
AMD specifications an overclocking
performance way be taken into account
here testing takes place exclusively at
1080p using a core i5 6600 k processor
with the latest graphics card and system
drivers under Windows 10 first up we
have battlefield 4 which is the only
game we've tested that wasn't released
within the last nine months still
despite being two years old now
battlefield 4 is still extremely popular
and visually stunning making it very
demanding on the GPU bang for your buck
the r9 380 2 gigabyte model looks like
the best deal here with an average of 58
FPS and a minimum of 48 fps the same
performance was also delivered by the 4
gigabyte model the 380 x was
disappointing here is it delivered just
5 FPS more on average the 390 proved to
be a huge step forward with 87 FPS and a
minimum of just 72 FPS crazy to see the
390 minimum frame rate sitting above the
380 X's average frame rates in the
section of batman arkham knight that we
test the 2 gigabyte 380 is a good option
for an average of 60 FPS though it does
dip as low as 39 FPS at times while the
4 gigabyte model is really no faster the
380 x again only offers a few extra
frames per second while the r7 370 is
only just playable with an average of
forty for FPS 390 is incredibly fast at
1080p with an average of 96 frames per
second making it just for PS lower than
the 390 X the fury was a lot faster
again hitting 122 FPS while the fury X
were just 6fps faster averaging 128 FPS
the 382 gigabyte is considerably slower
in call of duty black ops 3 dropping
down to 47 MP
staybridge with a 40 FPS minimum this
time the 4 gigabyte model is able to
offer a little extra performance is the
average frame rate increased 252 FPS so
the minimum was only slightly higher at
42 FPS again the 380 x offers a
disappointing gained over the 380
particularly when looking at the four
gigabyte model the 390 was again much
faster as the 69 FPS minimum frame rate
was much higher than the 380 X's average
frame rate the 380 was able to deliver
very playable performance in fallout 4
with an average of 60 FPS and a minimum
of 50 FPS the 380 x was on average nine
frames per second faster while the 390
was 27 frames per second faster and yet
again we see that a 390 minimum frame
rate which was 70 FPS this time was
slightly higher than the 380 x is
average Just Cause 3 is an awesome
open-world game that plays surprisingly
well on mid-range hardware the two
gigabyte 380 is a perfect example of
this with 50 FPS and the 4 gigabyte
model wasn't able to improve upon this
frame rate the r7 370 is struggled with
34 FPS and did dip down to 27 FPS but
for what you pay this isn't bad
performance one of the latest computer
games with the quality settings maxed
out of 1080p moving past 380 you we find
the 30 DX delivering 5 FPS more on
average at 55 FPS while the 390 brings
us up to 66 FPS beyond that the games
are pretty small given how much more
than 3 90 x fury and fury ax costs Mad
Max is probably the least demanding game
that we test with and using the highest
possible in game quality settings is
still playable on the radeon r7 370
which is impressive given the game looks
quite good the 380 provided excellent
performance with the minimum of 60 2 FPS
and an average of 75 FPS and again the 2
gigabyte and 4 gigabyte models delivered
the same performance Rainbow six siege
is the only game we didn't use fraps to
record a section of gameplay and instead
relied on the in-game benchmark which
seems to represent demanding game play
very well the r7 370 performs
surprisingly well and the minimum frame
rate never dipped below 30 FPS while an
average of 46 FPS
loud for relatively smooth and playable
gaming performance something else he
found interesting was the fact that the
4 gigabyte 380 was considerably faster
than the two gigabyte model delivering
almost thirteen percent more performance
this meant that the 380 x was just six
FPS faster than the four gigabyte 380
but 13 frames per second faster than the
two gigabyte 380 star wars battlefront
is another new game that despite looking
amazing isn't overly demanding
especially at 1080p here the r7 370
average 44 FPS while the 382 gigabyte
and 4 gigabyte models much faster with
60fps the 380 axe was only able to
average 66 FPS making it much slower
than the 390 which rendered 87 FPS on
average the r7 370 fails to provide
playable performance in the witcher 3
wild hunt the visual settings maxed out
this isn't entirely surprising as we're
using rendering technologies such as
hair works even the 380 struggled with
an average of just 35 FPS for the 2
gigabyte model while both the 2 gigabyte
and 4 gigabyte models dip down to the
same 23 FPS minimum ideally gamers are
want at least a 390 for this game as
this graphics card ensured that the
frame rate never dipped below 30 looking
at the power consumption and fallout 4
we see that a 382 gigabyte and 4
gigabyte models are reasonably efficient
particularly when compared to the 380 x
which consume almost the same amount of
power is the 390 the fury and fury acts
are also reasonably fuel-efficient given
the performance they deliver while the
390 X is a bit of a power Pig as the
entire system consumption reached 351
wats in this title the star wars
battlefront consumption figures are
interesting and don't really make that
much sense these are the kind of figures
i would expect to fire them from a game
such as the witcher 3 where the fury and
fury ax weren't a great deal faster than
390 for example the reason being that
the fury graphics cards are seen to
consume less power than the 380 x 3 90
and 3 90 X the margins aren't drastic
but it is unexpected that a fury
graphics card would consume less power
than say the 380 x in any game again the
380s consumed considerably less power
than the 380
x3 90 and fury graphics cards and as
expected the r7 370 consumes the least
amount of power initially I hadn't
planned to redo this video with the 380
x as was already quite clear the 380 and
390 were the best options for 1080p
depending on how much you want to spend
again we found on average that 380 x was
just ten percent faster than the vanilla
380 and given a COS almost thirty
percent more than the two gigabytes 380
it just doesn't make sense that said the
380 x isn't bad value or a bad graphics
card the 380 is just an incredibly good
bye and the 3 DX failed to change that
the plan initially was to move on and
create another 1080p gaming performance
video using the nvidia geforce 900
series in the end it made sense to start
over using the latest games and drivers
and well now that we've achieved that
you can expect the nvidia version next
week pricing is another reason to update
this video before the holiday season
there's been quite a few changes to the
AMD lineup since the 380 x is arrival
the 370 380 of 39 TX and now all twenty
dollars cheaper the 390 doesn't appear
to have moved in price and this is
probably due to the fact that it was
already much better value than the 390 X
the biggest price cuts have been made to
the fury of fury X both a fifty dollars
cheaper than they were a month
previously before we look at the cost
per dollar numbers let's just summarize
the performance seen in the nine games
tested on average the radeon r7 370 was
good for 41 FPS which isn't bad
considering every game was tested using
the maximum quality settings still for
smooth lag free gaming you want the 380
which averaged a healthier 56 FPS of the
nine games tested the four gigabyte 380
was noticeably faster than the two
gigabyte model in just two of them which
include a call of duty black ops 3 and
most notably Rainbow six siege given the
4 gigabyte model will cost us twenty
dollars more it's probably worth getting
over the 2 gigabyte model though be
aware for the most part there's little
to be gained at 1080p but of course this
could change in the future the 380 x
offers only a very minor performance
bump over the 380 while the three 90s
worlds faster we found
more often than not the minimum frame
rate was higher than the 380 x is
average so with all the new pricing data
taken into account which graphics cards
represent the best value at 1080p as you
can see despite being slow the 370
actually represents the best price per
frame ratio so those are a tight budget
this is your best option just be
prepared to scale down a few quality
settings the two gigabyte 380 also
represents excellent value as we found
previously and with an average of almost
60 FPS it comes into the cost of three
dollars 21 / frame while the 4 gigabyte
model costs three dollars fifty per
frame here we see that despite being
seventy dollars cheaper 380 x actually
cost slightly more than the 390 per
frame thanks to the 390 superior
performance as we found last time the
390 X fury and fury X all come at a
serious price premium and aren't really
worth it for 1080p gaming unless you're
chasing big frame rates for monitors
with extreme refresh rates this again
leaves us with the 380 and 390 is the
best value options named is product
staff and both work very well with all
the latest triple-a titles released over
the past few months the revised crimson
drivers not only look great but seem to
be working very well delivering small
performance boosts across the board
finally for those of you who want to
study the graphs in a more practical
format we've uploaded them in our forum
