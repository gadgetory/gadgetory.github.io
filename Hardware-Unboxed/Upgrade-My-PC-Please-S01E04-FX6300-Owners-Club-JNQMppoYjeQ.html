please if you missed any of the previous
episodes of the video explaining what
the series is all about and be sure to
check those out I'll provide links in
the video description so on last week's
episode we had 5 Core i5 PCs that roll
in need a very sup grades and you the
viewers voted a Keys Akatsuki the most
worthy of receiving the proposed
upgrades therefore we now have our first
new zealand-based winner and coming
Aki's way we have a brand new Core i5
1400 CPU a gigabyte be 350 motherboard 8
gigabytes of ddr4 memory and the fractal
design focus mini G computer case so
congratulations to Aki and the good news
is the 4 runners-up will be receiving a
Rainbow six siege game code from Ubisoft
big thanks to Ubisoft for supporting the
series and providing our contestants
with free games once installed we'll
have a key senders some updated photos
of the refurbished rig and then we'll
show them off to you guys there's a
special feature at the start of next
season also do not forget to vote each
week as that will place you in the
running to win some cool prizes and
those are global giveaways last week we
had ed some Ewell's who won the horizon
5 1600 processor and the week before ET
3d won a Seagate Barracuda 4 terabyte
hard drive so congratulations to those
guys as well
this week we have another cool prize and
I'll announce that later in the video
for now we have 5 pcs all in need of
various upgrades so let's check them out
samuel is a young guy who saved for over
two years to build a system or at least
a version of the system you see here in
late 2014 he pieced it together and back
then it had a single 8 gigabyte memory
stick the Radeon r9 270 graphics card
and a 500 gigabyte hard drive which was
being used as a boot drive since then a
few upgrades have been made most notably
of which is the geforce gtx 1060 which
samuel saved up for for quite some time
but he pulled the trigger on it in late
2016 he also scored a free 8 gigabyte
memory module from his mate very nice
bonus there the 500 gigabyte hard drive
was also dumped for a larger 1 terabyte
model and that holds all Samuels games
and he's also made the move to a speedy
SSD for the OS so that's a nice upgrade
there further upgrades though had been
put on hold as Samuels now saving to
study abroad next year in Japan while he
completes your 11 so the
dream would be to take this gaming PC to
the next level so we can enjoy that when
he's not studying speaking of games
right now he's enjoying subnautica GTA 5
and hearts of iron 4 but also works with
Photoshop and Premiere apparently the FX
6300 really takes its sweet time
encoding videos so Samuel has been
dreaming of horizon 5 6 800 upgrade but
hey who isn't these days so that being
the case propose we go ahead with the
risin 5 1600 grade and throw that eye
standard ATX as rock a be 350 pro 4
motherboard which will fill that Krueger
MX surrounded case at a bit better we
can only squeeze an 8 gigabyte kit into
the budget but the asrock board will
have two dims free for expansion then
because we can I think the be quite
system power 800 600 what would be a
worthwhile upgrade the 500 watt unit in
there is I suppose decent but it's one
of those included PSU deals and they
generally tend to be a bit cheap plus
those non sleeved cables are a bit ugly
am i right then the only last thing
would be the hydro Series H ATI I know
you can buy an adapter for the am 4
socket for this cooler and I'm not sure
if that will be required or not missus
something Samuel will have to look into
overall the upgrade package will
dramatically reduce using code times and
enhance the gaming experience so a win
win next up we have another FX 6300
powered rig and this one was also built
back in 2014 that was built by kevin as
a project for college to learn what
makes computers tick or in Kevin's case
really slow and have the hopeful gamer
to get completely bulldozed then Kevin
also started with the Radeon r9 270x and
eight gigabytes of memory along with a
single one terabyte hard drive over the
use he added a second one terabyte hard
drive another 8 gigabyte ddr3 kit and
the geforce gtx 980
which is comparable to the gtx 1060 in
terms of performance today the pc is
used exclusively for gaming to help keV
unwind and ease down time and well
that's exactly what a good gaming rig
should be used for the hope though is to
enjoy games such as battlefield one rome
2 total war and GTA 5 with less frame
jitter as kevin puts it with three
modules and six cores I can only imagine
how do
the experiences with the FX 6300
processor at the risk of being a bit
boring where once again going with the
horizon 5 1600 maybe in a few weeks
Intel can offer an alternative for
future episodes in the series anyway
since keV has a really nice black and
red theme going on I suggest the as rock
a be 350 gaming k4 and this time of
course we will be sticking with an 8
gigabyte ddr4 memory kit with the
leftover money the biggest impact we can
make is a 240 gigabyte SSD from Kingston
the UV 400 the SSD alone will live in
this PC right up and Kevin will be
loaded into games quicker than he can
say I don't miss my old FX 6300 me
minion minion meet the upgrade my PC
please audience don't upset them trust
me you don't want to do that
alright so minion was purchased as a
pre-built system from Ironside computers
in the US many it is Alex's first
desktop PC and I believe it was
originally purchased with gaming in mind
but alex has since gotten heavily into
music production as well as a little
video editing of gameplay footage the
system originally came with the geforce
gtx 960 - you give out graphics card but
that since been swapped out for a gtx
1060 other than that the system's pretty
much gone untouched what alex is looking
for in an upgrade is something that he
can improve upon in the future obviously
the am3+ platform turned out to be a
dead end his master plan right now is to
get the Rison 3 1200 processor and stick
that on the MSI be 350 PC mate with a
250 gigabyte SSD or there abouts well we
can certainly make that upgrade happen
with our budget in fact we can probably
even do a little better with the SSD and
CPU rather than dropping the Rison
through 1200 let's go for the horizon 5
1400 for those extra threads and as per
Alex's request let's go for the MSI be
350 PC mate motherboard with 8 gigabytes
of ddr4 memory then capping it all off
we can probably squeeze in the crucial
MX 300 and we can go with the 525
gigabyte model that is a seriously good
buyer right now now we're heading over
to New Zealand for the first time this
episode to check out Mackie's AMD FX
6300 rig yep another one
not lying with the title Mackey built
this system in late 2012 and I must say
you have to admire how well he's hung in
there at the time it wasn't even a
full-blown conclusion yet that the
bulldozer architecture moved about as
quickly as a bulldozer as the years went
by Mackey's love for his FX processor
remains strong and he decided to treat
it in 2015 all it needed was a shine in
UK so he purchased the NZXT h 440 and as
you can see here it does look quite nice
the following year the power supply was
upgraded because his existing model blew
up probably the FX pro saw the corsair r
MX series 550 what was dropped in to
take care of that power-hungry cpu then
this year Mackey's brother who sounds
like a real top bloke brought him a
shiny new rx 480 graphics card I suspect
though there might be a miner in New
Zealand trying to work out who stole his
R X 480
the impressive w25 15h monitor was
purchased secondhand and the pcs now
mostly used for 3d CAD modeling and
rendering as well as content creation
and photo editing so ideally what we
really need here is a CPU with more
cores and cause that are more efficient
than a coal power plant yep you guessed
it there isin 5 1600 is the best and
only sensible choice right now
for such a budgets of course we're
picking it for this build I think the
asou Spri be 350 plus will work well and
it'll look great in the NZXT and 440
unfortunately with pricing the way it is
in New Zealand the moment we can't
afford any more memory or perhaps a
bigger SSD still the upgrade from the FX
6300 to the horizon 5 1600 is
significant enough as it is and it will
provide Mackay with an awesome platform
to work with last but not least we have
the death star and if we're lucky with
the help of the force we can fire two
proton torpedoes into the am3+ socket
and end it Gabriel built the system
about a year ago he says and I've really
got no idea what his excuses if he'd
been following the channel or reading
the content over on tech spot we could
have saved him a lot of heartache
anyway Gabriel says it was meant to be
more of a workstation slash mid-range
gaming PC but today it's really just no
longer cutting it games such as
France Skyrim and battlefield 4 they
play okay he says but more modern titles
are really becoming an issue the FX 6300
and gtx 1050 TI combo is really going to
struggle at 1080p with modern games so
we really do have to focus the budget on
getting a new cpu as well as a GPU
ideally I would have liked to upgrade
the raid max power supply but that I'll
just have to do for now thankfully the
upgraded PC probably will draw less
power than what the FX system is using
currently Gabriel already has an SSD so
we can leave the storage alone so I
propose we opt for the rise and 5 1400
on the asrock a be 350 pro 4 with 8
gigabytes of ddr4 memory then to really
improve the gaming experience we'll
ditch the gtx 750ti in favor of the gtx
1050 - i and that right there is a big
step up indeed the 1050 Ti is capable of
tackling all the latest styles at 1080p
using reasonably good quality settings
so Gabriel won't know himself alright
guys there are 5 power-hungry
FX 6300 pcs all in need of various
upgrades it's now your job to let us
know which one you think is most
