sponsoring our Computex 2018 coverage
check out courses fancy new Vengeance
RGB memory and don't forget to arm
yourself with the game-changing
performance that only msi geforce gtx
ten series graphics cards can deliver
give yourself the competitive edge
you're looking for even in the most
challenging titles fast powerful and
made to game visit the link in the
description now to learn more welcome
back to hardware own box where he at the
asrock booth to check out some of their
latest Intel products now I was
expecting to see some Intel's e3 90
motherboards here at the show at
especially the asrock booth but as it
turns out Intel's e3 90 platform hasn't
been launched at Computex 2018 we
haven't seen any z 390 boards at the
asrock booth or really for any other
company here at the show so clearly
Intel is still working on this l3 19
platform and we'll be showing it off
perhaps later this year of course we
have seen some said 390 leaks in the
past couple of months but like I said
they're just not here at the show yet so
again we were waiting to see that later
in the year hopefully alongside their
new 8 core CPUs that have also been
rumored and that's pretty disappointing
to be honest aside from the core i7 8086
K that was leaked a couple of days
before Computex kicked off Intel really
hasn't shown any new consumer components
or platforms that you'll be able to get
your hands on in the coming months we've
been hearing about Z 390 through various
rumors for months and months now and in
fact it was just a couple of weeks ago
that Intel themselves accidentally
released documents for the Zed 390
chipset detailing every aspect of the
platform we thought this accidental
document leak would definitely mean said
390 was coming at Computex but we're
here at the show now and not one company
was showing off new Zed 390 boards so if
you are eagerly awaiting the Zed 390
platform for its native USB 3.1 gen2
support and integrated Wi-Fi 802 dot 11
AC support we're sorry to say that you
might be waiting a bit longer with Intel
struggling to get next gen chips out the
door intend animators it's looking more
and more likely that eight core coffee
Lake will launch later this year is
Intel's Knight's generation of desktop
processors perhaps said 390 will launch
alongside it or a bit before those CPUs
it's hard to say for certain at this
point but it was a bit surprising tip
the Computex show
for only to find nosey 390 boards
anywhere but we do have some other cool
things to check out here from asrock and
Intel so let's get straight into it
okay so we're here with as Rox latest Z
370 Taichi platform that they're showing
off here at Computex 2018 in fact it
actually has two of their rx 580 phantom
gaming GPUs in there as well so it's
pretty exciting but the key feature of
this particular system that they're
showing off is intel's obtain memory now
if you do have a mainly hard drive
driven system maybe ever start an SSD in
there as well obtain memory does have
the ability to accelerate your game
loading times which is partially what
they're showing here with some of their
benchmarks now actually built an Intel
obtain memory system in a live stream on
the channel just a couple of weeks ago
and I might be doing a bit of testing on
octane in the coming weeks with that
particular system so it'd be really
interesting to see how it actually goes
as far as speeding up games and
accelerating that sort of thing so stay
tuned for a bit more of that on Hardware
unboxed all right we're here with
another Intel system at the azrog booth
in fact on this side I'm actually being
cooled by one of their mining rigs
that's running at the moment pretty nice
to get some of that cool breeze for the
Taiwanese heat but on this side we have
a fatality X to 99 system and the cool
thing about this particular system is
that it's running their ultra quad m dot
two cards that's a PCIe 16 x expander
card it's got four m dot two cards
inside and running in there are four of
Intel's obtained SSD 905 piece and we'll
show you some of their benchmark runs
that they've got with that in raid zero
and let me tell you there's some
extremely impressive performance numbers
with that super fast SSD of course we
already know Intel so obtain SSDs are
really really fast and it's cool to see
that as a demonstration here at the
asrock booth alright so that's it for
this video from the asrock booth as we
were leaving both Steve and I were given
these phantom gaming bags with some cool
goodies inside actually let's take a
look and see what asrock has been given
us so we have here's something in a
package looks like a custom asrock hat
here so do I look cool Steve oh good
yeah alright and there's there's one
other item in here we've got an phantom
gaming something but this is a mousepad
what do you reckon
yeah definitely a mousepad steve says
quite a nice-looking mousepad there so
that's all the cool goodies that we were
given at the asrock booth hope you liked
