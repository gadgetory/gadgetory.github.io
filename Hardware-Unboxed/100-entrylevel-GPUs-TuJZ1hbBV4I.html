hardware unbox video I hope you're ready
for some serious benchmarks because
that's exactly what we have on the menu
for you today as most of you are
probably aware and video just recently
released the new GT x 1050 series if you
didn't check out our reviews on the msi
cards you can check them out here and
here ensure MSI's base model versions of
the GT x 1050 and 1050 Ti gave us a good
look at what these new GPUs have to
offer Matt and I were quite impressed
with both GPUs particularly the hundred
and ten dollar base model 1050 which is
surprising because some of you guys in
the comments weren't that impressed with
the 1050 particularly in relation to
last generations Maxwell base 950
granted it isn't worlds faster but you
have to remember the 950 came in with a
launch price of 160 US and it only been
discounted recently to combat AMD SRX
464 less money the RX 460 roughly
matched the now discounted gtx 950 and
given the choice of either I would go
with a meze option here every time in
our previous eight game test the 1050
might have only been 7% faster than the
950 on average but it also comes in the
same launch day price as the rx 460 the
1050 is also responsible for AMD Swift
price reduction of the rx 460 though if
initial impressions are anything to go
by further price cuts might be in order
that's why we're here today to work out
exactly how the gtx 1050 and RX 462
gigabyte graphics cards compare in a
head-to-head battle on the menu for you
guys we have 23 games in total all of
which have been tested at 1080p using
suitable image quality settings
overclocking won't be a focus here as
neither model we have on hand is
particularly great when it comes to
squeezing out extra performance so there
isn't a clear advantage here that said
performance per what will be
investigated and naturally we'll be
looking at cost per frame as well as was
the case with the original reviews we
will be benchmarking with our core i3
test rig despite featuring a Zed 170
motherboard and only one liquid cooler
and excessive power supply this system
does do a good job of representing
typical mid-range gaming rig performance
thanks to the use of a core i3 6100 T
processor the low voltage CPU has been
included on purpose because at 3.2 GHz
better represents our core i3 Ivy Bridge
older processors perform as for the
graphics card we're using the MSI GTX
1050 to GOC and the XFX rx 462 gigabyte
5d the MSI card features a 4.3 percent
factory overclock while the XFX card has
been overclocked by just one point six
percent now you might be thinking that's
a bit unfair the Nvidia card is factory
overclocked higher giving an advantage
albeit a tiny advantage in a way you
would be right however please let me
explain why we did things this way there
isn't a reference version of either the
rx 460 or gtx 1050 so we have to use
partner cards for this comparison and it
makes more sense to use projects you can
actually buy anyway the highest clock
are x4 62 gig card we could find was the
assist dual fan model though it's
clocked just 4 megahertz higher than the
XFX version we have on hand and it cost
$20 more to boot so almost all factory
overclocked RX 460 cards operate it
between 1210 and 1220 megahertz
meanwhile factory overclocked gtx 1050
graphics cards operated a boost clock of
between 1493 and fifteen hundred and
fifty-six megahertz
the MSI model runs at a conservative
fifteen hundred and eighteen megahertz
making it one of the lower clocked
partner cards crucially is also
available 110 dollar MSRP so I hope that
clears things up for those of you who
were concerned about the cards used for
testing and their operating clock speeds
with that I think we've spent enough
time explaining and even justifying how
we're testing let's just get on with it
first up we have Assassin's Creed
syndicate and four playable formats we
were forced down to the still very
respectable medium quality preset the
460 was good for 43 frames a second on
average while the 1050 delivered a more
desirable 56 frames per second this gave
the geforce cut a 23 percent performance
advantage here batman arkham knight
provided slightly more competitive
results though the 1050 was still 18%
faster rendering 53 frames per second on
average to the rx4 60s 45 frames per
second in our opinion battlefield one
plays best using the DirectX 11 API for
both AMD and NVIDIA owners still for
this comparison we'll be testing the
game using both AP is an effort to keep
things fair using the ultra quality
settings at 1050 is able to deliver a
playable 49 frames a second whereas the
460 struggles with the
five frames a second giving the geforce
card a 40% performance advantage here
shifting gears to DirectX 12 we see a
massive 22 percent reduction in
performance for the 1050 meanwhile the
RX 460 does gain 9% more performance
thanks to reduced overhead and the fact
that we're using a core i3 processor
here that said the big issue here is the
fact that the minimum frame rate doesn't
improve overall when using DirectX 12
the 460 has an 8% performance advantage
over the 1050 we were probably a little
too aggressive with the quality settings
in Crysis 3 that said dropping down to
high or even medium shouldn't change
performance margins between these two
GPUs using the very high settings the
1050 averaged 35 frames a second making
it 21 percent faster than the 460
mankind divided is an AMD special and
here the 460 enjoy a 9% performance
advantage rendering 36 frames per second
to the 10 50s 33 frames a second these
are quite low frame rates and it is
worth pointing out here that we were
using the medium quality preset the 1050
blew through the dirt rally benchmark
rendering an average of 76 frames per
second and never dipping below 62 frames
per second in fact the 10 50s minimum
frame rate was quite a bit higher than
the full 60s average in this game making
the 10 50 36 % faster using Vulcan in
Doom the results are very interesting
we found previously that graphics card
is limited to a 2 gigabyte frame buffer
really struggled in this title when
using Vulcan the rx 462 gigabyte for
example is much slower than the full
gigabyte version
despite delivering our healthy 51 frames
a second whereas AMD generally has a
nice performance advantage when using
dooms Vulcan implementation this isn't
the case here the 10:50 superior memory
compression gives it the edge in this
memory hungry game allowing it to
deliver almost 40% more performance f1
2016 is another racing simulator that
favors the 1050 though this time the
GeForce graphics card was just 14
percent faster interestingly the 460 did
seem to take a slightly larger
performance hit when looking at the
minimum frame rates the fallout 4
benchmark resulted in a dead heat with
both GPUs rendering a very playable 51
frames a second on average using the
high quality preset the 1050 did dip to
a slightly lower 42 frames a second
though this won't be noticeable and is
technically within the one to two frames
per second margin of error even after a
three run average the GT x 1050 streaks
or laying Far Cry primal rendering 51
frames per second on average to the 460
s 40
one frames a second this gave in video
our 24 percent performance of energy
when comparing the average frame rates
right so if you've made it this far
you've definitely wrote yourself a drink
I'm sticking with water I'll probably
need that to get through the rest of
these results but feel free to drink
something a little more exciting as we
continue back at it we have Gears of War
4 running the higher quality preset the
1050 averaged 54 frames a second and
this was enough to give it a 15%
performance advantage over the 460 the
460 still played quite well though never
dropping below 37 frames a second
stealing cars is a more enjoyable
experience at 60 fps and the 1050
delivers that for the most part
averaging 61 frames a second at 1080p
using the high quality settings using
the same quality settings the 460 was
20% slower averaging 49 frames per
second when mafia 3 was first released
the developer hard capture the game at
30fps in protest PC gamers band together
forcing the cap to be removed sadly it
is now evident why the cap was put in
place optimisation sucks and I guess
they thought hiding the fact with a
30fps frame cap rather than fixing it
was the way to go the end result for
budget game is a low quality experience
at low frame rates the 1050 spat out
just 41 frames per second though this
did make a 24 percent faster than the
460 cutting up orcs requires a steady
framerate and for this a weapon
exceeding 2 gigabyte of VRAM is likely
required the 1050 averaged a relatively
high 51 frames a second but at times dip
down to 30fps
meanwhile the 460 suffered a similar
fate fluctuating from an average of 42
frames per second all the way down to 26
frames per second of course there is
plenty of room to move on the quality
settings here as we did load up the
ultra preset in the end the 1050 was an
average 21% faster using the medium
quality preset both GPUs glided through
Mirror's Edge catalyst rendering at
least 50 frames per second on average
the 1050 pushed a little higher
averaging 59 frames a second making 18
percent faster than AMD SRX 464 fans of
overwatch we have good news
both GPUs are able to maintain over 60
FPS at all times using the ultra quality
settings on our core i3 test system for
optimal performance the 1050 is the best
choice here though as it was 34% faster
Steam's version of Quantum broken
doesn't play particularly well with the
460 despite delivering play
performance the full 60 was 31 percent
slower than the 1050 which managed a
buttery smooth 68 frames per second for
raiding tombs as a fire young lass
either GPU will suffice both delivered
much the same performance though they
did also both suffer from rather large
frame dips using the high quality
settings so some tweaking here will be
required these are the results you're
looking for
both GPUs rendered over 40 fps at all
times using the high quality settings
with the average exceeding 50 FPS the
1050 might have been 18% faster here but
the 460 still provided ample performance
The Witcher 3 was tested using the high
quality settings and here the 460
averaged 40 fps to the 1050 s 46 fps
this gave the GeForce GPU of 15 percent
performance advantage and meant
performance never dipped below 41 fps
Rainbow six siege was tested using the
higher quality preset and even here it
is still a bit of a memory Pig the 460
for example averaged 54 frames a second
but at times dropped as low as
twenty-nine frames a second meanwhile
the 1050 average 63 FPS but would drop
as low as 38 fps in the end the 1050 was
17% faster on average the division is a
very demanding game even with the high
quality preset as a result the 1050
averaged 41 fps making it just 5% faster
than the 460 finally we have total war
Warhammer which was tested using the
DirectX 12 API which is still marked as
beta for this game the 1050 was a single
frame fast in the 460 so at I hear then
well there you have it an in-depth look
at how the gtx 1050 and RX 462 gigabyte
comparing a good number of titles from
2015 and 2016 now to wrap things up
let's try and quickly break down the
data into something that makes a bit
more sense as you can see the 1050 is by
far and away the faster GPU winning in
20 of the 23 games tested 18 of which at
1 by a 10% margin or greater the 1050
was slower in just two games and the
results were questionable from one of
these games as we aren't happy with
battlefields DirectX 12 performance at
the moment for either camp probably the
most surprising result was seen when
testing with doom using Vulcan as this
handed the 10:50 one of its strongest
wins overall the 1050 was on average 18
percent faster when telling up all 23
games before jumping to the cost per
frame figures let's just take a
we look at efficiency by comparing power
consumption against average frame rates
again we know that the 1050 was 18%
faster rendering 53 frames per second on
average to the 4 60s 45 frames per
second yet despite being almost 20%
faster it allowed our core i3 test
system to consume 20% less power when
gaming this is a huge advantage and
invidious favour when it comes to
efficiency and this is certainly
something to keep in mind when making
your buying decision okay so now it's
time to look at the all-important
pricing metrics we know that the 1050
costs just $10 more than the 460 which
is obviously a negligible difference
despite being a 10% price hike although
you will pay slightly less for the 460
that doesn't mean it actually works at
being cheaper taking the resulting
performance into account we know that
the 1050 was 18% faster but actually
cost 7 percent less per frame in the end
it's pretty simple you're paying 10%
more for a 10% more performance for the
RX 462 you gabite to be truly
competitive
I feel aimed at really need to knock
maybe another $10 off the asking price
of course as many of you often point out
pricing does vary from region to region
and in Australia we know this all too
well in the u.s. right now it's possible
by the RX 462 year but for as little as
$100 whilst there are some 1050 selling
for the MSRP which is 110 dollars and we
expect more cards to be selling at that
price in the near future
however down under the 1050 cost 210
ozzie while the RX 460 starts at just
165 ozzie for now that actually makes
the RX 460 a better buy for my fellow
aziz and i suspect the same is true for
other regions when these new cards come
out they don't often meet the MSRP for a
couple of weeks so be sure to check
prices for both products in your region
I personally really like our fish at the
GTX 1050 years the fact that the card
doesn't require a PCIe power connector
is awesome and should be of great
benefit to those making do with all the
computers on the other hand though the
RX 460 is slightly cheaper and can take
advantage of the ever-growing army of
affordable freesync monitors in the end
what's clear here is the fact that
budget gamers have two great options
capable delivering impressive 1080p
gaming performance so what do you guys
think and let us know about pricing in
your region also let us
if you're considering buying a graphics
card with either of these GPUs and
finally if you liked this video please
take a moment to give us a thumbs up we
really appreciate that and if you found
the testing useful even consider sharing
it but as always we greatly appreciate
the support and look forward to seeing
you guys in the next one so those of you
that already support the channel thank
you so much it's truly appreciated and
to those of you that would like to
support the channel directly I do have
Amazon links and a patreon link in the
