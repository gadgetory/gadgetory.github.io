probably noticed that 2017 was one of
the most exciting times in a long time
to be building a new computer
despite that though it did actually all
start off with a somewhat boring and
disappointing fashion in January with
the release of intel's underwhelming kb
lake cpus which offered no real
improvements over 2015 skylake
architecture factory overclocking really
was the name of the game there things
though change dramatically in March as
AMD finally released their hotly
anticipated Zen architecture with the
rise in seven series and with that ended
half a decade of getting bulldozed by
the competition from that point forward
it was a busy we also got some new GPUs
and Intel had a second go at things with
coffee-like however while there was a
lot to get excited about when it came to
PC Harbor in 2017 it was also plenty to
be upset about as well or at least
frustrated unfortunately some of these
problems have gotten worse and probably
will continue to worsen throughout 2018
and it's making building a PC right now
increasingly difficult so let's talk
about these issues I've decided to break
this topic up until what will probably
end up being a three-part series and in
this part part 1 we're going to talk
about ddr4 memory pricing and why it's
so high right now so let's get into that
the big issue plaguing those wanting to
build a new computer even update an old
one whether it be for gaming or
productivity is ddr4 pricing from July
2016 to July 2017 a 111 percent increase
for the average selling price of ddr4
memory was seen that's an insane
increase over a 12-month period and the
worst part being that it's continued to
increase since then what this means is
for the consumer an 8 gigabyte ddr4 2400
memory kit cost around $35 u.s. in 2016
a year on you could expect to pay a
little over $70 for the same product now
fast forward today and consumers are
faced with an asking price of at least
$90 so
that's about a hundred and seventy
percent more than what we were paying
roughly eighteen months ago so why has
DDR for pricing increased so much in the
past eighteen months as is always the
case when DRAM pricing explodes it's a
supply and demand issue right now demand
is heavily outweighing supply it's
difficult to predict when supply will
improve but most reports suggest that
this will happen in late 2018 when the
manufacturing of 64 layer and 96 layer
3d NAND flash reaches maturity okay so
it's a supply issue but why what does
cause supply to either decrease or
demand to increase well I believe we've
been faced with a sort of double whammy
situation the major DRAM suppliers
shifted focus away from ddr4 production
due to tight margins had I've been
investing production elsewhere in
previous years growth in the traditional
desktop computing sector was slow and
this meant nobody wanted to pay a
premium for ddr4 products and as a
result manufacturers didn't want to make
the memory if they're not going to
achieve their planned targets and
returns with limited demand in late 2014
with Intel's Haswell II and has multi P
range which continue in 2015 with
skylake and then again 2016 with
Broadwell the limited supply wasn't
really an issue however in 2017 we saw a
rapid shift in market demand towards
desktop computing not just Intel but now
AMD were also shipping process is
supporting ddr4 memory no doubt you can
also blame cryptocurrency miners for the
demand in ddr4 memory in 2017 I'm sure
many of the mining rigs built that year
did use ddr4 memory further increasing
the demand and this is probably an even
bigger factor is the smartphone industry
which drove up the demand of not just
DRAM but also NAND as well it's a
different type of ddr4 memory that's
produced for the mobile market a low
powered ddr4 lpddr4 for short memory
manufacturers such as Samsung they make
more profits selling lpddr4 memory and
premium smartphones
hence the shifting capacity so at that
point demand started to outweigh
supply prices increased and ddr4 margins
were no longer tight by mid 2017 the
price of memory modules has soared
significantly as we saw in the example
given earlier ok though that's not
really a problem memory manufacturers
will just ramp up production and we back
to the way it was in 2016 happy times
for PC builders well sadly no according
to market research firm DRAM exchange
the three major ddr4 supplies being
Samsung SK Hynix
and micron slowed down their capacity
expansions and technology migrations to
maintain prices in 2018 at the same
levels seen in the second half of last
year obviously they're doing this to
sustain strong profit margins this means
you probably shouldn't expect ddr4
memory pricing to fall anytime soon
certainly not too much later in the year
the construction of new fabs
is underway to help the strain supply
but they won't be ready for mass
production until 2019 at the earliest
that's predicted by Gartner that ddr4
pricing will crash in 2019 history would
suggest this is likely to happen as it's
the sort of cycle we go through every
few years with memory pricing China does
have the potential to change things here
though their aggressive approach to the
semiconductor market could cause price
and become even more unpredictable for
example Chinese memory could flood
markets worldwide causing pricing to
plummet right now there is a large
number of Chinese owned fabs under
construction and it is expected that
China will overtake second place for
investment in semiconductors this year
as it equips many of the new fabs that
began constructing in 2016 and 2017 it's
also been reported that China's National
Development and Reform Commission is
investigating the possibility of DRAM
price fixing between the major industry
players and this of course has been
sparked by the price surge that we've
been talking about if found guilty I'm
not sure what the ramifications would or
could be so we'll have to see how that
story plays out it would appear though
that they do have quite a bit of power
here as SK Hynix and Samsung both have a
number of facilities within China
so in 2018 you have a choice hold off on
building your new PC or just take the
hit on memory pricing ideally these days
PC gamers will want a 16 gigabyte kit
and those cost at least a hundred and
seventy dollars u.s. though decent kits
our price closer to $200 granted it
would have only cost you around 70 to 75
dollars in the good old days but try not
to dwell on that
unfortunately it's out of our hands the
problems PC gamers face looking to
upgrade or we're still build a new PC
from the ground up and more than just
inflated ddr4 memory prices in the next
part of this series which will be online
in a few days we're going to discuss
graphics card prices we'll talk about
what happened last year and why why it's
continuing and what you can expect later
in 2018 so stay tuned for that I'm your
host Steve
I'll catch you again next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
