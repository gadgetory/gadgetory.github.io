talking best CPUs best value best
performance best at melting a hole in
your motherboard bested emptying your
wallet
leaving your homeless I was just joking
about those last two that said though
the core oh nine series does get an
honorable mention anyways the top five
best is a series I just started it's not
an original name I'll admit and there
are lots of clickbait dish type top 5
videos on YouTube but I like to think my
content rises above that least a little
bit over at tech spot we do have the
best of series but I thought rather than
rip that off and make up my own I just
go with the generic sounding top 5 best
for now naming aside given how well the
first episode was received which covered
the gtx 1070 graphics cards I decided to
make this a regular thing I'll be
looking at other graphics cards soon
such as the 1060 1080 and tell you ti
models along with some stuff from the
red team for now though for this one we
will be looking at CPUs that said this
isn't just a pick the best CPU for
whatever category that I decide we'll
also be taking the platform into account
so this means like the best value CPU
for example must be supported by the
best value motherboards so the
categories I'm going with include best
budget CP it's pretty straightforward
best value quad-core that will be a
little bit interesting our best
performance desktop CPU gain that kind
of self-explanatory and best value
productivity or workstation class CPU so
that's something with a higher core
count that makes sense and then best
extreme desktop CPU which is pretty much
the best extreme desktop CPU about a
year ago now my best budget pick was an
AMD APU the a 876 50 K to be precise for
the price the CPU lent itself well to a
multitude of tasks including gaming well
entry level gaming anyway
times have changed though and if you
want the most bang for your buck I feel
Intel's Pentium G 45 60 can't be beaten
prices are $64 us this jewel called ship
comes clocked at 3.5 gigahertz and
boasts hyper threading support for 4
threads essentially it's a soup
core i3 the G 4560 is arguably the only
good thing to come out of Intel
seventh-generation KB Lake series and
it's that good we'll take it even if you
plan to game the G 4560 Trump's the a
876 50k and not because the HD graphics
6/10 is any good it's certainly not but
rather because if you take the $40 you
say by buying the cheaper Intel CPU you
can reinvest that any more powerful
discrete graphics card there are some
cheap options to choose from but I
recommend coming up with a little extra
cash and picking up a gtx 1050 for
around $100 finally the g 4560 can also
be paired with an inexpensive h 110
motherboard prices start at just $50
u.s. for a brand new board and all the
essential features are on offer
alternatively you might be able to find
a h1 70 or Zed 170 motherboard for
around the same money on the second-hand
market the dead 170 in particular will
offer a richer upgrade path allowing you
to take advantage of unlocked Core i5
and i7 CPUs as well as higher clocked
memory the best value quad core well
there really are just two contenders for
this category and we'll get to them in a
moment
first the reason I went with the best
value quad core category is because many
still see the quad core as a requirement
for mid-range gaming these days and
they'll turn their nose up at the ultra
affordable G 45 60 so the contenders are
the core i5 7600 K and the Rison v 1400
I've ruled the 1500 X out as I recommend
going for the six core 1600 if you're
going to spend a bit of extra money also
for mid-range GPUs there's zero
difference between the 1400 and 1500 X
for gamers now remember there's a big
emphasis placed on value here so I'm not
going with whichever one is the best for
allowing high-end GPUs to render 1000
frames and csgo for example for two
hundred and forty dollars you have the
core i5 7600 K which requires a dead
series motherboard and they start at
about $90 you also need to add another
20 to $30 us for a quality air cooler so
the total bill I would say is at least
350 dollars u.s. the horizon 5 1400
comes in just 170 dollars us a decent be
350 motherboard cost $70 and there's no
need to buy a cooler as the race stealth
is pretty good so total damage on this
one is just 240 dollars u.s.
the 1,400 also has the advantage of SMT
support meaning it supports eight
threads whereas the 7600 K is limited to
four threads
generally speaking the 7600 K is a
superior performer for CPU intensive
games such as battlefield one but the
1400 is certainly very competitive
chances are though
over time the horizon v 1400 will grow
stronger and stronger in relation to the
7600 K so saving 30% on the rise in CPU
seems like the smart option unless you
absolutely need those extreme frame
rates for competitive gameplay I know
I'm certainly not that good
prior to Rosen's release I was
recommending the core i5 6600 K is the
best value enthusiast grade CPU it might
only have 4 cores but it crushed
AMD's FX series in any and all games and
also pretty much every workload you
could throw at it
priced at $240 u.s. it was also
reasonably affordable unless you wanted
to pay more for a hyper threading
enabled core i7 there were no better
options earlier this year the KB lake
7600 was released at the same price but
with no IPC gains on offer so basically
a factory overclock Department now for
as little as two hundred and ten dollars
u.s. we have the horizon 5 1600 which
comes armed with two additional cause
eight more threads and a whopping 10
megabytes more level 3 cache the 1600
also includes a decent box color in that
price whereas the 7600 K doesn't come
with a cooler at all for productivity
workloads that can take advantage of
multiple threads the 1600 and Nile eight
to the 7600 K even taking overclocking
into account for gaming there is still
the argument to be made that intel's
higher clocked quad-core is better but
as more games starts to utilize risings
many cores like ashes the singularity or
total Warhammer for example the 7600 K
is going to look vastly inferior in
comparison bottom line how can you not
love a 6 core 12 thread CPU that can be
overclocked to 4 gigahertz on all cores
using the stock cooler they're near
enough to $200 us Australians can also
pick up the processor for the bargain
basement price of 290 dollars Aussie
not everyone games I know it's quite
shocking and not everyone who games only
games some of us actually do some work
now and then it's a cruel fact of life
anyway if your work involves heavy
processing you'll want a very capable
CPU preferably something with a lot of
cause that can make short work of big
tasks well if that's the case I
recommend Intel's upcoming Xeon Platinum
81-73 M it's a 28 call 56 thread Beast
expected to cost around $16,000 u.s.
it'll send emails quicker than you can
say shoot I forgot the attachment okay
so refinancing your home isn't an option
then perhaps I can interest you in the
AMD Rison 7 1700 seriously the 1700 is
the only choice here at 310 dollars us
the core i7 7700 K is a slick CPU but
for 340 dollars it pales in comparison
for similar money you get pretty much
half of everything half as many cores
half as many threads half as much level
3 cache meanwhile the core i7 1700 X
cost $80 more and still can't match the
1700 s core count or processing power
the horizon 7 1700 not only eliminates
everything from Intel priced above $300
but it does the same for AMD zone lineup
as well there's little point in
purchasing the 1700 X at $400 I think it
has been a bit discounted since I
checked this pricing but anyway it's
still not as cheap as the 1700 and the
same goes for the 1800 X at $500 given
we have found all three rise and 7
models are capable of hitting the same
clock speed of around 4 to 4 point line
gigahertz I don't see the point of the X
models as a nice little bonus this base
model horizon 7 CPU also includes the
AMD rate spire cooler this then makes
the horizon 7 1700 the ultimate
all-round high-end CP on my opinion if
you're not big on overclocking can also
pair it with an inexpensive be 350
motherboard so well under $100 us
okay so you've got money to burn
and as a proud PC user you want everyone
to know it previously I recommended such
an ego go with the core i7 69 50 X for a
cool $1,700 us I have one myself I got
it for free though and I'm kind of
embarrassed to admit that I use it if
you in any way care about value then
there isin 7 1700 is the obvious choice
but if you want the most expensive
desktop see if you available right now
the core I 9 1700 X is it well still
hideously expensive Intel's new 10 core
CPU is considerably better value than
their previous generation 69 50 X at
$1000 it's a little over 40% cheaper
while delivering much better performance
thanks to higher operating clock speeds
and a reconfigured cache hierarchy
apart from being incredibly expensive
the seventh 100x does run very hot when
overclocked at the very power hungry and
it doesn't come with a cooler and the X
299 platform it's also very expensive
however it's also blistering fast and
with a custom liquid cooling solution
the overclocked performance is nothing
short of incredible I would just like to
point out though that I have made it
clear in the past I don't recommend
buying the 700 X until AMD's thread
ripper arrives and we've had a chance to
reevaluate still if you must buy now and
you're aware that a competitor is
incoming then she'll get the 700 X it's
still a beast well there you have it my
CPU Peaks for June 2017 the pentium g
4560 pretty much the obvious choice for
budget shoppers and I don't think the
upcoming rise and three CPUs later this
year will probably change that we'll
have to wait and see of course I'm also
keen to see what the Raven Ridge ap use
have to offer very excited about those
ships the best value quad-core was a
close one you could easily make an
argument for the 7600 K but I feel the
r5 1400 is the better or rounder the r5
1600 seems like the obvious choice to me
for the best performance desktop CPU and
likewise the r7 1700 as the best value
productivity CPU and then picking the
core I 970 100x as the best extreme
desktop CPU whoo that was um yeah that
was an interesting pick I have to admit
and it's no doubt going to stir up some
controversy in the comment section so I
can't wait to see how that play
it's going to be a lot of fun speaking
of which while you're battling over the
best CPU pics in an effort to defend the
honor of your clan let me know what your
top five worst see for you list it looks
like quite a few of you asked me to do a
top 5 worst series after I did the first
episode of the top 5 best last week and
yeah I have to admit that's kind of a
fun idea we could have a bit of fun with
that one anyway that's going to do it
for this one I'm your host Steve see you
again next time guys
