episode of unboxing boxes with Matt Matt
hey guys and welcome back to another
episode of unboxing boxes without Matt
hey guys welcome back to harbor unboxed
hey guys welcome back to another episode
of unboxing boxes with Steve um yeah I
guess that's what we're going with
alright well let's do this Matt hasn't
trusted me with his famous knife so I
think that's the star of the show so
he's not gonna risk letting me use it so
I've just got a little multi-tool that
I'll use here and we'll get into it
let's have a look at what's inna this
box shall we alright it's very very
light trying to cut myself I've been
excited to do this series so hopefully
there's some good stuff for me to play
with well we have oh it's Western
Digital brand-new WD blue SSD and we
have the one terabyte model on hand well
looking at the picture on the box it
looks like it's a 2.5 inch SATA SSD and
as I said it's the one terabyte model
let's just pop it open and have a quick
look at this see what we got nothing
else in the box just the SSD itself no
screws or 3.5 inch adapter and well that
way for that side that way for that side
yeah so these are based on the SanDisk X
400 series which is wildly regarded as
pretty much one of the best performing
TLC based SATA SSDs it uses a Marvell
controller and 15 nanometer NAND flash
so pretty good driver I have no idea I'm
pricing or anything like that at this
point and hopefully it's a little more
competitive in the X 400 series but we
won't know just yet or at least I don't
okay that was cool
and I'll probably get stuck reviewing
that as well since Matt's taking a bit
of time off with these knee
all right next up I reckon this box here
looks pretty good I'll take leave this
one the shrink wrapped monster and we'll
see what's in this cut straight I'll try
the rematch trigger opening it without
cutting it Oh Matt makes it look hard
but I don't know all right this I have
no idea what these are pull the master
master pulse headset I haven't actually
seen these before
Matt sort of the headset expert around
to you so there you go I'll um I might
do a bit of quick research so I can tell
you something about it because the box
doesn't give away much but they they
look very impressive anyway one second
all right I've got a few notes here they
are virtual 7.1 surround bass FX system
RGB of course RGB cups why the hell
wouldn't you have those 44 millimeter
drivers inline USB remote suspended
headband and extra padded ear cups okay
well they look impressive they seem
reasonably priced as well 109 dollars is
the recommended retail price in
Australia which to me seems good because
the cloud revolver Pro is 120 and
Logitech's g63 3 animus spectrums cost
like 170 so that's pretty good since I
can't tell you a huge amount about and
we might we'll have a good look and see
what they're like not sure when you'll
be seeing a review on these well they do
look and feel really good though a
couple of twist ties at the back here
come on okay single cable and you can
split off to individual or the headsets
and mic little nice little control box
for volume and enable/disable my got a
bit of weight about them I like the
steel frame it looks good and feels good
and yep that's left well they're
actually very well padded I can't hear
myself virtually how they look
thanks cool well hopefully Matt can
recover before two longer check them out
otherwise I'll have to do it and that
will require a bit of research on my
behalf
anyway that was fun I'll probably end up
playing with them later this afternoon
might even play some battlefield one
testing purposes of course alright time
for this little box to reveal what is
hiding inside I don't know why Matt
makes the ripping the boxes open look so
hard it's okay he's not as strong as he
looks like those ah you may have seen
this already on the channel the aiders
new portable SSD it's got an exciting
name it's the SE 730 only comes in 250 C
250 gig sorry and if you recall Matt
looked at this a few weeks ago or got
this a few weeks ago and had a few
problems with it basically when he
plugged it in it took at least 20
seconds to be detected show up in the
Windows Explorer so you could actually
start using it which is weird because it
should only take 2-3 seconds at the most
after going back and forth with a data
trying to work out the problem they
eventually discovered that it was a
firmware issue on the early review
samples they've since updated that sent
him a new one this one should detect
within a couple of seconds and
performers expected so I might actually
that towards the end of the video if we
have time but there'll be a review on
this on the channel pretty soon anyway
alright
just stick that there now we've got two
big boxes here from Thermaltake maybe
they've sent me a water cooling kit and
there might be a case coming so I can
build myself one of those core P threes
just an idea thermaltake keep that in
mind all right well that's should we
start with the beer
we'll start with what's that with the
big one actually I can tell you it
weighs a lot a ton would be an
exaggeration but that's how I would
describe it interesting very interesting
I'm not sure what's going on here
okay well fortunately it's no water
cooling set up for my imaginary p3
system that I'm hoping to build soon but
it is a heap of power supplies well we
got one two three four five here
well I better take that and show them to
you so we've got the smart DPS G 750
watt there and this is why the box was
so heavy it's full of power supplies we
have this 600 watt model and we've got
what looks like to me a little STX or
SFX STX that's the bloody new Intel
thing 600 watt SFX tough power power
supply that's a huge capacity unit in a
tiny form-factor seven-year warranty
still don't know why I have all these
but let's keep going TR to s I think
that's their new budget power supply
series we've got a 550 watt model there
and a 450 watt model so it's a lot of
power supplies I'll get rid of this box
push your piece to the side till I can
work out what to do with them and we'll
see what else they've sent water cooling
gear come on
you're kidding me
well believe it or not we have another
tough power this is an 800 watt model we
need more power supplies on this episode
and a 500 watt model at this point I
think I'm going to have to ring Matt to
find out what this is all about
we'll give him out a quick quick call on
the phone and see if he can explain why
we have what is it like seven or seven
power supplies no idea what he's got
planned
hey man it's Steve hey down there as
well as to be expected then I suppose um
quick question if you don't mind I just
I'm in the middle of unboxing boxes
without making on the title anyway it's
not important we have seven or so
Thermaltake power supplies what's the
deal with that okay all right and so
when are we doing that you want me to do
that all right
you want to why do you want to say
something that's enough mate stop asking
everyone for drugs we'll see you later
bye okay well it was interesting the
idea with the more than half a dozen
power supplies is Matt was saying you
get us in the comments all the time what
sort of power supply needs you know for
this build do I need this power supply
all that power supply basically it's all
about power supply capacity and what you
need for you know core i3 system core i7
or an AMD system or whatever so I wanted
to get a heap of different powers
flyers as in different ranges of
capacity build a couple of different
systems and rotate the power supplies
through the systems to see how much
draws on them how they're handling it
and all that sort of stuff
I don't know if the aims to try and blow
any of them up but we'll see so
basically that's what's happening there
it looks like I'm gonna have to do all
that and that gets out of it so I'll be
testing a hell of a lot of thermal tape
power suppliers so on today's episode we
got to look at all the thermal tape
power supplies Westerner yields new SSD
which I'll probably be testing in the
next week or two on the channel we've
also got the a data portable SSD which
I'll also be testing on the channel in
the next few weeks when we filled in
with the time at the moment I'm heavily
well I've just actually finished filming
the GTX 1050 2 gig versus the RX 462 gig
and that's a pretty interesting
comparison actually so that'll probably
be live on the channel tomorrow
afternoon and then either later in the
week depending of how I go with time or
next week we will have the GTX 1050 tii
2 gig versus the RX 464 gig and RX 474
gig cards because it sort of sits in the
middle of those two and I think that one
is going to be a really interesting
comparison so that's all for me for now
this has been unboxing boxes with Steve
hope you guys enjoyed it if you did give
me a thumbs up a like that it'd be
awesome and I'll probably see you guys
next week when we do it all over again
see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
