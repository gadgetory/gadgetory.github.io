are looking into revisiting the original
9900 doing a bit of a retest quite a few
people over the last few weeks have been
requesting that we do that so I put
together a video outlining the issue and
then handing over to you guys and asking
if you think we should revisit the
testing and if so how and basically the
most popular voted option there was to
retest the well retest the 9 ROK and 95
watt TDP limit and then compare those
results to the results from our original
review so that's what we're going to do
in this video if you missed the previous
video which led up to this one and
outlines in a bit more detail why we're
doing this test then you can check that
out it's called do we need to re review
the core I $9.99 or okay I'll provide a
link for that in the video description
anyway I won't go over all the details
again but in short motherboard
manufacturers are currently getting the
blame for running the 90 100 K AB spec
when in reality we strongly believe it's
Intel who's cheating their own spec and
pushing board partners to run the 99er
okay at the default clock multiplier
table rather than the official power
spec whatever the case out of the box
the 900k isn't running at the Intel spec
it's essentially overclocked and this
has caused power and thermal results to
go through the roof so in today's retest
we will be showing how the coronoid 9rk
performs when adhering to the Intel
specification and comparing that data to
the current out-of-the-box experience
doesn't really matter where you stand on
this issue having a resource that shows
how these configurations compare under
the same conditions is useful
information in our opinion for the
unlimited testing the msi Meg Zee 390
godlike has been used and for the 95
watt limited testing I use the Isuzu ROG
Maximus 11 hero I loaded up the extreme
memory profile and opted to use Intel
settings which enforces a 95 watt TDP
limit so let's get into the results
first up let's look at the Cinebench r15
multi-threaded scores previously we
found the 9900 K breaking the tooth
Point barrier however with the TDP limit
in place the score is reduced by
fourteen percent down to seventeen
hundred and sixty three points and that
place is at roughly on par with the core
i7 78 20x and crucially this meant it
was a few percent slower than the 2700 X
already you might be getting a sense of
why Intel is happy for board partners to
run this CPU out of spec next up we have
our blender short run test and here the
TDP limited configuration can only short
bursts up to 119 watts for roughly 10
seconds this means for half the test the
900 K is still close to fully Unleashed
this is why we're only seeing a 9%
reduction in performance but still a
reasonable drop off but it's not the
full story almost every professional
looking to invest in our rendering rig
will be running workloads that take much
longer than 20 to 30 seconds generally
we're talking well hours of rendering
work well we saw a 9% reduction in the
short run test here we're seeing a 14%
reduction in the more realistic
rendering workload that's a pretty big
drop-off and it means the 900k is now
only keeping pace with the much cheaper
rise in 7:20 700x the corona benchmark
runs for over a minute and here we see a
13% decrease in performance when power
limited this means whereas the 99er ok
it was 25% fast in the 2700 x1 allowed
to run without a power limit with the 95
watt TDP enforced it's just 9% faster
it's still faster but for those of you
who aren't interested in overclocking
and spending big on cooling that margin
isn't really impressive particularly
given the price here we see a 15%
reduction performance for the 9900 can
using the 95 watt limit and this minute
was just 4% fast in the 2,700 X whereas
we've found it to be 23 percent faster
previously running the 7-zip compression
test we see that performance isn't
really impacted that heavily by the 95
watt limit a 3% decrease is almost not
worth discussing so let's move on to the
decompression results here the 99 her
okay was 7% slower with the TDP limit
enforced and that was enough to make it
slower than the horizon 720 700 X so
it's not a significant difference but
the fact that the 99er okay now appears
to be slow on the rise and 7 processor
isn't a good look for Intel
moving on Excel
is the perfect example of a short
workload at well under 10 seconds the
99er okay isn't really impacted by the
official Intel spec and we see much the
same performance with and without the
TDP in place testing with handbrake we
see another 14% reduction performance
with the TDP limit enforced and this
meant that the 9900 K was now just 4%
faster than the 87 era K and 13% faster
than the horizon 720 700 X that said the
first and second generation rise and
CPUs don't do that well with a VX
workload so let's check the margins
again with the h.264 test where we
previously saw a 14% reduction
performance running h.265 encoding we
only see half that hit with a non AVX
encoding workload using h.264 we saw a
7% reduction but given how much better
Rison does here this meant the 900k was
now slower than the 2700 x it also
wasn't much faster than the 87 okay for
those of you wondering the 99er okay
with the TDP limit in place dropped down
to an all core frequency of 4 gigahertz
in the h.265 test but it did sustain 4.2
gigahertz in the h.264 test moving on
here we see another example where the 95
watt TDP sees the 9 RK come in behind
the 2700 X or bit by a small margin it's
also interesting to note that in this
Premiere Pro CC export the unlimited 99
hurricane configuration matched the 78
20x a 140 watt part on the same process
I've said previously that the 9900
could have at least a 140 watt TDP
rating and that does seem to fit with
what we're seeing here the premier warp
stabiliser test doesn't max out all
caused all the time it's a pretty
typical editing workload and here we see
just a 6% reduction in performance with
the TDP limit in place still that was
enough to see the 9900 K come in behind
the 8700 K okay so these results explain
a lot previously we saw a few reviews
that claimed the 19 on her okay consumed
a less power than the 8700 K which
doesn't really pass the common sense
test and for good reason however if we
test the 99er okay with a 95 watt TDP
limit and leave the 8700 k without a TDP
limit you get this that said even with
the TDP limit in place the 87 or okay
and at 6 cores won't
be impacted nearly as much as the 9-yard
okay and it's eight cause for things to
remain relatively even the 99er okay
would need a TDP limit of at least 125
watts anyway what we see here is a 31
percent decrease in total system
consumption as all eight cores are wound
down from 4.7 gigahertz to 4 gigahertz
and as you can see that 15 percent
reduction has a profound impact on
system consumption as we're also taking
a lot of voltage out of the chip at the
lower clock speed in blender we see a
27% reduction in total system
consumption and now the 9900 K looks
like a mighty efficient CPU it was a few
percent fast in the 2,700 X and here we
see a reduced total system consumption
by 12 percent previously it was 19
percent faster than 2700 X but it also
pushed consumption 21 percent higher
well given what we just saw from the
total system power consumption results
and these thermal numbers while shocking
hot that's surprising
using the Noctua NHD 15 and Corsair
hydro h 100 i pro we found that nine
200k to hit temperatures in the mid 80s
when fully Unleashed however using the
95 watt TDP spec the 1900s out at just
64 watts in our blender stress test and
that figure was dropped to just 58
degrees with our open custom loop so
when operating all cores at 4 gigahertz
the 99 are ok he's as cool as a cucumber
but at 4.7 gigahertz it turns the CPU
socket into a fiery pit of melting
silicon okay it's not that bad but it's
pretty bloody hot in comparison okay so
what about games well here we see when
testing with Assassin's Creed Odyssey
that there is a measurable performance
hit in CPU intensive titles though even
then it's only under unrealistic
conditions so gaming at 1080p with a 90
X 20 atti
so at 1080p we do see an 8% hit to frame
time performance that margins reduced to
three percent at 1440p playing GPU bound
titles like Forza horizon 4 shows no
impact and I expect this is how the
1080p results will look in most titles
so please keep that in mind as we are
mostly focusing on CPU bound games in
this video fours are being the exception
here we see a 7% hit to frame time
performance when testing with hitman at
turn EP
that's said we still see a 6% hit at
1440p that's not until he hit the 4k
resolution
the margins evaporate interesting that
we see no real impact in project cars
too though this title is a bit odd in
the sense that the 9900 K is so much
faster than the 87 or ek I'm not exactly
sure why this is but the game certainly
doesn't require a cause but other
sources have confirmed these margins so
it's not some strange bug with my test
system there's also no real margin to
speak of when testing with Rainbow six
siege any modern CPU running at around
four gigahertz seems to work well here
we do see a pretty hefty 15 percent
performance hit in frame time
performance at 1080p and shadow of the
Tomb Raider though once you get to 1440p
were almost entirely GPU bound then
finally we have Star Wars Battlefront 2
and here we see a small performance
drop-off at 1080p nothing extreme again
by the Tommy at 1440p the margins close
up to nothing okay so gamers need not
worry about the 95 watt TDP spec it
really doesn't make much difference
either way and with a run at overclocked
out of the box or with the 95 watt limit
motherboards won't run or the 1900 K
rather won't run at insane thermals or
power consumption at least for gaming
having said all that if you work on your
PC as well as game and your work
involves intensive CPU workouts they're
about the only kind of workouts I seem
to do these days then yeah it's a quite
a different story in our long run
blender workload the 1900 K temperatures
really do go through the roof when not
abiding by the 95 watt limit we saw an
increase of about 20 degrees so pretty
significant that and of course that
being the case it was a similar story
for power consumption that's obviously
what led to the higher thermals and we
saw a total system consumption climb by
almost 40% so a lot more power being
used there but of course it is running
about 700 megahertz higher so yeah quite
a difference there in clock speed but
basically what this means is if the 1900
K was forced to run at Intel's TDP spec
or their power spec whatever you want to
call it and well abide by the power
limits it would be a much more efficient
eight core processor it actually be a
mighty efficient eight core processor
you get 2700 X light performance while
saving a little
10% on power and the 2700 X is already
quite an efficient processor this is
actually a pretty big problem for Intel
the 1900 was already a tough sell in the
overclock configuration used by
motherboard makers and well I suppose
Intel knew that would be the case it's a
$500 eight called desktop CPU
campaigning with a $300 eight core
desktop CPU and as we just saw with the
95 watt limit in place it's barely any
faster than the rise in 727 hundreds in
fact in some tests it was slower man
that's a bloody awful result for a CPU
that costs around 70% more so again that
really is a big issue for Intel and as I
say they've kind of painted themselves
into a corner for the 1900 K to make an
ounce of sense for anyone who isn't an
extreme overclocker it really needs to
run at around 70 degrees with a quality
aftermarket cooler and for that the TDP
can't really go any higher than about
105 watts which is the TDP rating for
the 2700 X though Intel and AMD I
arrived at their TDP ratings quite
differently however even at 105 watts
it's barely any faster than the uncapped
8700 cane it's only a whisker faster
than the much cheaper 2700 X so you
can't really have that with a core I
name processor now for those of you
wondering at 105 watts or a hundred and
five watt limit that sees the knight RK
sustain a clock speed of four point one
to five gigahertz in our blender
workload and it runs it up to 69 degrees
using the course at age 100 I approach
that's a hundred and fifty megahertz
increase over the 95 watt TDP and that
increase to the operating temperature by
about five degrees basically the 99 or
okay is I was going to say a really good
overclocker
suppose it's a good overclocker and if
you could say it's a really good
overclock if you invest big in cooling
it is quite good it's certainly better
than the 2700 X and that was the point I
was working towards making the 2700 X is
pretty much maxed out out of the box you
can squeeze a little bit more out of it
if you get a really good chip then
there's a little bit more there to be
had but most of the gains will come from
tightening up the memory sometime
because that really helps out the
horizon processors yeah my point is you
can't really overclock the snot out of
the
like you can with the Intel CPUs that
said with motherboards technically
overclocking the 9900 k2 ad the default
clock multiplier table which sees 4.7
gigahertz as the old core for example
under those conditions there really
isn't that much left on the table for
most 5 gigahertz will be the limit and
going beyond that good luck keeping it
cool requires a serious amount of time
effort money spent on cooling and then
probably a bit of risk involved with
dealing it and if you really want to get
serious sanding down the die so yeah not
for the faint heart of that one so
realistically you're talking up to maybe
6% extra left in at a 6% boost from a 5
gigahertz overclock that's really the
most you're looking at there and that is
that's over the unlimited results I
shouldn't say so not over the 95 watt
TDP but that's kind of irrelevant since
none of the board's use that out of the
box so not a huge amount of overclocking
Headroom left with the way the 1900 K is
coming
technically overclocked out of the box
for those of you planning on buying the
900 K because you want to take advantage
of the fact that it is an unlocked part
and by that I mean you plan overclocking
it then you'll want to look at how much
overclocking head room there is in
reviews and whatnot and see how it
performs there however believe it or not
for at least half of our viewers that by
these unlocked K type processors from
Intel such as the 8700 K or the 99 her
okay don't actually plan on overclocking
them you might find that hard to believe
but we've done some polls on the channel
before and it's about 50 percent for
overclocking 50 percent for not
overclocking and even out of that
overclocking bunch some of them admit to
just enabling things like MC so enabling
those kind of auto overclocking type
features which is kind of what we're
seeing here out of the box
anyway with these ed 390 motherboards
I've had a few people who've managed to
buy the 1900 back and some of them have
been trusted patreon members and for the
most part they do appear very
disappointed and the common theme that
I'm seeing is that it has unmanageable
thermals and that's certainly what we've
found in our day 1 review and then they
say enabling the Intel spec which avoids
the thermal problems
you then get a situation where the
upgrade wasn't really worth it
so I suppose you could come up with your
own spec that's sort of somewhere in
between there maybe a hundred and twenty
watts
keep it there but rather than letting it
go up to a hundred and fifty plus so
yeah I think Intel could do a much
better job with these unlock parts of
creating a spec that makes sense and
just as a side note I guess you could
blame the people who bought the 900 K
for buying it and then finding out that
it runs like a toaster on their
motherboard at least with the sort of
well the unlimited type conditions I
suppose you can say but they would be
basing their purchase on the results
that we showed and most other reviewers
showed so you have to admit the day one
reviews the productivity results were
quite impressive I know they didn't
justify the price but yeah it did leave
the 2700 X and the dust for quite a few
tests so not a bad processor anyway
moving forward I think the best course
of action to do is stick mostly to the
sort of typical out-of-the-box
experience and if that means testing
overclocked CPUs well that's what we'll
do if there was just one or two
motherboard brands or even one or two
motherboards showing these overclocked
or running the cpu out of spec something
like the MSI god like for example then
we would have redone our review
completely because that wouldn't reflect
the typical out-of-the-box experience
but that's not the case as far as I can
tell all of the Z 390 motherboards or
just almost all of them run out of spec
and the asou spawns do as soon as you
load XMP and agree to the asou optimized
settings so I think that's pretty much
it for this one on a final note if we do
find situations where we need to do
alternate testing or a follow up like
we've done this video then I'll create
videos just like this one and hopefully
that helps avoid some of the confusion
anyway I think that's about enough for
this one I hope you enjoyed the video if
you did hit the like button subscribe
for more content just like this we have
a lot of really cool videos coming up on
the channel over the next few days few
weeks and probably the next few months
that I can't see that far in advance
just yet anyway thank you for watching
I'm your host Steve I'll see you again
