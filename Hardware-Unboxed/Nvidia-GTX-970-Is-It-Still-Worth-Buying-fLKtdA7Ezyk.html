I'm taking yet another detailed look at
a previous generation GPU a few weeks
ago I checked in how the fury X is
getting on in today's games and then
followed that video up with a look at
the gtx 980ti since a lot of you thing
you enjoy that series I have decided to
revisit the GTX 970 which I will then
end up comparing in part two to the r9
390 the GTX 970 is a particular interest
for a few reasons it's the only GPU that
I can think of that was went with so
much controversy and drama upon release
and yet despite that became one of the
biggest hits ever out of the gate it was
met with rave reviews for its unbeatable
value on launch day in my own review I
gave it a stellar score of 95 out of 100
claiming it brings top-notch value and
performance and noted that there's even
more to see if you plan on overclocking
I was less impressed with the GTX 980
suggesting that was a tad too expensive
but did note that overall it was still a
very impressive GPU right so none of
that sounds controversial all that drama
infused at all that came shortly after
the glowing reviews when it was
discovered that roughly 13% of the full
gigabyte vram buffer was partitioned off
limiting that memory to a much narrower
memory bus the card was advertised to
have the same 256-bit wide memory bus as
the GTX 980 resulting in a bandwidth of
224 gigabytes per second however due to
the core configuration is wasn't
possible and rather than risk harming
the cards marketing potential with a 3.5
gigabyte memory buffer Nvidia awkwardly
tacked on another 512 megabytes using a
narrower 32-bit wide bus so while the
card did technically have a full
gigabyte via Ram buffer it wasn't
capable of the performance claims rather
the GPU was limited to a memory
throughput of 196 gigabytes per second
when working from the primary partition
and just 28 gigabytes per second from
the smaller half gigabyte partition the
controversy prompted a class-action suit
against Nvidia as well as board partner
gigabyte Nvidia CEO issued an apology to
gamers on the company's blog in an
attempt to appease gamers
but in the end ultimately had to offer a
refund to those who previously bought a
GTX 970 this however didn't change the
fact that at the time the performance
seen in those glowing reviews was the
exact same performance gamers were
receiving the worry though was that
gaming titles would inevitably become
more bandwidth hungry and at the GTX 970
would eventually fall into a heap that's
a legitimate concern at least to a
certain extent many gamers though do
grossly seem to overestimate the
importance of the vram buffer and think
that having more memory somehow always
equals more performance overlooking the
fact that the GPU itself might not have
enough power to actually crunch that
much data efficiently we saw this with
the r9 390 which went from the r9 290
full gigabyte buffer to a much larger 8
gigabyte buffer with no real upgrade to
the GPU itself last time we looked into
this by matching both GPUs o'clock 4
o'clock and the playable conditions they
both delivered the exact same
performance it might be interesting to
look at this again now that we have a
newer and more demanding games anyway
back to the GTX 970 despite the
controversies and the negative backlash
and all that angry pitchfork stuff this
GPU actually strengthened invidious
position despite the odds that went on
to be one of their best-selling GPUs of
all time roughly two and a half years
later the GTX 970 is still by far the
most popular GPU used by those that game
on the massively popular steam platform
according to their hardware and software
survey last month almost 6% of all
gamers that use the service did so with
the GTX 970 in their rig just three
percent of gamers now run with a GTX
1060 and disappointingly less than one
percent used the highly underrated RX
480
with so many GTX 970 graphics cards
having been sold it's not surprising to
find a huge number of them on the
second-hand market it's possible to
easily snap one out for under $200 u.s.
in fact I had seen some selling Frizzles
150 dollars u.s. and that's a quite a
few of my viewers asking me should they
consider snapping one up the
alternatives at that price ranges these
are three gigabyte gtx 1062 the RX 470
or the RX 484 gigabyte model so I've
taken my old game with GTX 970 phantom
graphics card benchmark
getting the out-of-the-box configuration
and then again with a custom overclock
in the past I have to say the GTX 970
has looked very weak when tested using
the in-video reference clock speeds
admittedly though this can be a bit
misleading as in video were very
conservative when it came to clocking
their Maxwell based GPUs game would for
example shift their GTX 970 with a 10%
factory overclock and that has a rather
significant impact on performance as you
might expect not only that though but I
was able to boost the clock by further
10 percent taking the core to twelve
hundred sixty-five megahertz which
resulted in a boost frequency of just
over 1.4 gigahertz what I want to know
is though can the GTX 970 still cut the
mustard and is it worth purchasing if
you can get it for somewhere around the
GTX 1052 o or rx for 70 money so let's
go find out rise of the Tomb Raider is a
very memory intensive video game and
here at 1080p the GTX 970 does very well
matching the three gigabyte gtx 1060 out
of the box through overclocking it does
find a further 12 percent performance
hitting an average of 104 FPS and
consequently overtakes the six gigabyte
gtx 1060 which happens to be none other
than a factory overclocked for the wind
plus model now at 1440p the GTX 970 does
start to struggle though the out of the
box configuration still manages to keep
pace with the RX 470 and matches the
minimum frame rate of these three
gigabyte gtx 1060 and four gigabyte our
X 480 overclocked it is able to sneak
ahead of the a key of our X 480 but does
fall short of the EVGA 6 gigabyte 1060
keep in mind this is an Nvidia sponsored
title so I'm certainly not expecting the
GTX 970 to look this good in relation to
the RX 480 and all of the games tested
Far Cry primal was tested with the HD
texture pack installed and enabled out
of the box that matched the RX 470
though it's true potential was realized
only once overclocked here we see a 20%
boost in performance reaching an average
of 65 FPS to match the EVGA gtx 1066
gigabyte card overclocking doesn't help
the gtx 970 out of 1440p which is
interesting that said it's not a
complete disastrous performance is still
on par with the gtx 1063 gigabyte an RX
488 about graphics cards
although in videos Maxwell Hiro looked
quite impressive and rise of the Tomb
Raider and Fire Cry primal the same
can't be said for the division when
using the direct x12 API the performance
isn't horrible but here the 970 can only
match the 470 once overclocked the
performance margins are similar at 1440p
and here the our X 480 a gigabyte and
gtx 1066 gigabyte are out of reach of
the previous generation value champ
despite sparing at some embarrassment by
using dx11 the GTX 970 still doesn't
make out particularly well in hitman
though to be fair it was at least as
fast as a three gigabyte gtx 1060 at
1080p similar margins are seeing at
1440p and again out of the box the game
with GTX 970 phantom match to the GTX
760 3 gigabyte now these results are
very interesting indeed and dare I say
is this evidence of Nvidia neglecting to
optimize their previous generation GPUs
even when overclocked the GTX 970 is
well down on the 3 gigabyte GTX 1060 not
something we've seen previously the same
is true at 1440p and here the GTX 970 is
14% sold in the 3 gigabyte GTX 1060
still it was able to roughly match the
full gigabyte our X 480 the GTX 970 does
get back on track for the overwatch test
and out of the box they will roughly
match the 3 gigabyte GTX 1060 making it
faster than the RX 488 gigabyte graphics
card overclocked it was also able to
catch up to the 6 gigabyte gtx 1060
bumping the resolution up to 1440p we
find similar results and again the GTX
970 looks very impressive in this title
brace yourself the Doom results are
unexpected oddly the GTX 970 is faster
than the 60 watt GTX 1060 once
overclocked here at roughly matched the
RX 470 with a very unexpected 167 fps
that's an 11% boost over the factory
overclock which did see the game would
phantom graphics card trail d6 gigabyte
gtx 1060 even at 1440p the margins
remained much the same in fact here the
GTX 970 is able to slightly pull away
from the RX 470 once overclocked again
we find some rather unexpected results
this time when testing with total war
Warhammer
here the GTX 970 matched these three
gigabyte GTX 10
60o the box and wasn't a great deal
slower than the six key of our model so
nothing unusual there however once
overclocked performance was boosted by
11% as we reach 79 FPS making the game
woods graphics card faster than the
floor gigabyte our X 480 only slightly
sold in the 8 gigabyte model bumping up
the resolution didn't change too much
again we saw a 10% boost from our
customer overclocked Mirror's Edge
catalyst throws up performance that's
probably more in line with what we would
expect to find here the GTX 970 is on
par with the RS 470 and therefore not a
great deal slower than the 4G but our X
480 meanwhile through overclocking it is
able to keep up with the eight gigabyte
rx 480 and six gigabyte gtx 1060
graphics cards moving to 40 and 40 P we
find similar margins though here the GTX
970 isn't quite as strong but the
reduction in performance when compared
to its nearest competitors is almost
unnoticeable out of the box the cut-down
Maxwell GPU is roughly able to match the
six gigabyte GTX 1060 and more
impressively once overclocked it finds
itself sitting between the our X 480
GPUs moving to 1440p the GTX 970 with
its factory overclocked for slightly
further behind the 6q byte gtx 1060 but
again it is able to match the 8 gigabyte
our X 480 once overclocked much like
what was seen when we tested the
division using DirectX 12
it seems Maxwell's inferior low-level
API performance is once again a problem
this time in Deus Ex mankind divided out
of the box the gang wood GTX 970 was
slowly our X 470 though overclocked it
was able to match these 60 about gtx
1060 we find similar results at 1440p
though it is very interesting to note
that unlike the three gigabyte gtx 1060
the GTX 970 didn't fall away here
that'll feel one puts forth quite the
challenge for the GTX 970 though
matching our x4 70 out of the box was
still very impressive overclocked we
reach our X 480 for gigabyte levels of
performance but we're still quite a way
off the gtx 1066 gigabyte the 1440p
margins are much the same and with an
average of 63 FPS once overclocked it
really is hard to deny that the gtx
hasn't gone the distance for those who
purchased that over two years ago the
GTX 970 even does reasonably well in
mafia 3 at least in relation to GPU such
as the
4:17 our X 480 it does require clocking
to match the our X 480 a gigabyte
graphics card and this meant that it's
still quite a bit slower than the gtx
1066 gigabyte now 1440p we see an 11%
performance boost from our overclock
though this only netted us an extra 3
FPS on average having seen weaker than
expected performance in the division and
Deus Ex mankind divider when using
DirectX 12 the Gears of War performance
is surprisingly strong out of the box
the GTX 970 delivered a strong minimum
frame rate and once overclocked to match
the gtx 1066 gigabyte and our x4 88
gigabyte the GTX 970 did follow a
slightly at 1440p nothing extreme but it
was certainly more impressive about
1080p the Maxwell GPU doesn't look
particularly impressive out of the box
when testing with titanfall 2 at least
when compared to the RX 470 for example
that said it does still manage to
maintain over 60 FPS with the very high
quality settings and effect overclocking
boosted performance by a massive 14%
margin and I suspect the memory
overclock was particularly useful here
overclock the game wood card was able to
match the gtx 1066 gear but moving to
1440p the GTX 970 now looks much better
with the factory overclocked one
compared to the GTX 1060 s regular once
we apply the manual overclock it is
again able to match the gtx 1066
gigabyte once again we see strong
performance gains from the GTX 970 once
overclocked and here it was able to
match the rx 470 rx 480 and GTX 1063
gigabyte graphics cards in Civilization
six now at 14:40 Peters able to match
the GTX 1063 gigabyte and rx 470 once
overclocked the Call of Duty infinite
warfare performance is fairly typical of
what we've been seeing out of the box
the game wood GTX 970 matches the RX 470
and once overclocked is able to catch up
to the gtx 1066 gigabyte the GTX 970 is
slightly weaker at 1440p and although
still very playable it does fall further
behind the RX 470 in its out-of-the-box
configuration the watchdogs true
performance is very similar to what we
just saw when testing with infinite
warfare at 1080p the GTX 970 is faster
than the rx 470 but slower than the rx
484 gigabyte then once overclocked it
roughly matches the GTX 10
six gigabyte once again cranking the
resolution up to 1440p does slow the GTX
970 down slightly but of course the
results are highly disastrous I have
updated my benchmark results to include
Resident Evil 7 biohazard as many of you
know this game is a massive vram pig
this can already be seen at 1080p here
the 3 gigabyte gtx 1060 does suffer
quite a lot and so too does the GTX 970
in relation to the RX 470 that's at
overclocking liqueur and memory really
does help out the Maxwell GPU and now
it's able to match the RX 470 of course
this is hardly something 970 owners
would brag about but it does help save
face much the same as seen at 1440p
though out of the box the GTX 970
appears very weak again no overclocking
is able to regain quite a bit of ground
all right so we're almost the finish
line last up we have for honor here the
GTX 970 wasn't a great deal slower than
the full gear by our X 480 out of the
box overclocked it was able to close in
on the GTX 1066 Q button our X 48
gigabyte graphics cards this time at
1440p the GTX 970 remains very strong
with the margins going almost unchanged
when it comes to power consumption
Maxwell was very efficient for its time
and even today it's still very
impressive the factory overclocked game
wood model only consumes slightly more
pals and MSI's our X 480 gaming x8 g/mol
meanwhile our overclock only increased
system consumption by 9% which is very
good of course that is almost a 50% jump
in total system power consumption when
compared to the EVGA gtx 1066 gigabyte
card and for the most part the 970 was
slower right so now that we've looked at
how the GTX 970 performs in 20 modern
games let's tally up the results and
take a look at the averages as we often
found the game with GTX 970 phantom
delivered similar performance for the RX
470 out of the box once overclocked we
saw a performance boost of 12% on
average and this allowed the GTX 970 to
match the RX 484 gigabyte while falling
slightly short of the GTX 1066 gigabyte
those GPUs were of course only factory
overclocked and do have a bit more
headroom left when custom overclocking
them further
take the RX 470 for example although not
overclocked here in the past we have
been able to extract somewhere
between ten and fifteen percent more
performance out of this graphics card
this then would place the RX 470 on par
with the overclocked GTX 970 results
that you see here that being the case
you can safely say that the GTX 970 now
performs similar to that of the RX 470 a
graphics card that sells around 170 us
or 270 ozzie today therefore second-hand
shoppers will really want to be paying
no more than 150 dollars u.s. or say 250
dollars Aussie for a secondhand GTX 970
graphics card even at that price though
you have to wonder if you're not just
better off buying new and investing in a
GPU that's proven to deliver better
DirectX 12 performance one thing I will
say for those of you who purchased the
GTX 970 back in 2014 or even 2015 for
the $330 US MSRP you have certainly
gotten your money's worth if you do
indeed agree that it's on par with the
RX 470 then the card is only depreciated
by $75 a year or 47% of its initial
retail value that's pretty good and the
fact that it's still such a capable
1080p gamer and really for the most part
can handle 1440p without much trouble it
means that will continue to deliver for
some time yet anyway in summary is the
GTX 970 worth buying well obviously it
comes down to the price and based on all
the testing we've just done the results
we've found I believe that price to be
no more than 150 u.s. or 250 ozzie so if
you can get one for that price or less
then yes it is worth buying so if you
guys enjoyed this video please hit that
like button really really appreciate
that
support is great and I am still working
on the r9 390 benchmark results and I
hope to have them up soon it takes a
huge amount of time to do all this
testing testing the card and it's out of
a box form and overclocked but I will
definitely get that done because I'm
very keen to see how the 390 compares to
the 970 in the games you've just seen
tested anyway that's all for this one
I'm your host Steve I hope to catch you
again very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
