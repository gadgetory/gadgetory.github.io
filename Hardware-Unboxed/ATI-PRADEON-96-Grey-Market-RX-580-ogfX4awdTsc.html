of a weird one here wasn't quite sure
what to do with this but anyway we're
making a video so a patreon member
actually it was the guy that gave us
these really cool knives so supplied
these 4 unboxing boxes anyway
same guy that owns so that's sky soldier
blades he also owns silver knight pcs
calm and yeah recently he came across
this well a lot of these so this is
meant to be or is an rx 584 gigabyte
graphics card now he was offered around
3,000 of these he could buy them in I
think it was 15 lakh quantities for a
discount and then he could just resell
them or use them in the pre-built
systems that he makes anyway
he passed on that because they're not
the kind of components he uses in his
pre-built systems it usually sticks to
the well-known brands and brands it'll
you know give you a warranty and all
that sort of stuff but these were
extremely cheap for our x5 80s anyway as
I said he passed on the offer but yeah
because they were so cheap and quite
interesting and wasn't sure if they were
a scam or not he decided to buy a couple
of them and just check out what the deal
was and he offered one of them to us
wanted to know if we wanted to buy one
and say well yeah we bought one I
thought it would make for a pretty cool
video so hopefully it does really wasn't
sure if it was a scam or not that's
always kind of interesting to look into
because if there are large volumes of
this particular card floating around
then chances are before too long some of
you guys hunting for deals will run into
them anyway the guys at silver knight
pcs as I said bought a few of them
they've tested one of them they sent me
this one and they believed there
probably are x5 ATS sorry Rx for ATS
that have been reflashed to five ATS so
not a big deal if that is the case
anyway they said they were available in
bulk orders of 15 they were $70 us which
is dirt cheap and that was including
shipping as well so yeah potential
bug in there for anyone trying to get a
really cheap rx 584 gigabyte card and
really being able to get these for under
$100 is pretty awesome and then if they
were to buy them just I think like I
said they ordered three so there were
$96 us each so still a really good
purchase they're $70 is insane if it is
what it's meant to be but yeah $96 for
this graphics card but was it worth
buying right now graphics card scams
running a bit rampant on places such as
eBay freeing random example you see
things like what a GT seven tens or yeah
GeForce GT seven tens they get sold for
well they get reflashed and sold as gtx
1050 s of course they're they're
definitely not gtx 1050 s so very sad
that that thing is becoming quite common
on ebay from Chinese sellers and I
haven't looked into it recently I'm
going back quite a few months now but
back then there there was a lot of them
on eBay and eBay didn't see any doing
anything about cleaning them up so yeah
bit upsetting there that so many people
were getting ripped off thinking they
were getting a really good value GT 1050
anyway I wanted to know if a similar
thing that was going on with this is
this like an RX 470 that's been a
rebadged we see that sort of thing
happened for internet cafes and things
like that over in China is it an RX 460
or is it something worse so we're gonna
find out beyond initial sort of
inspection I had definitely suspected
this to be a scam so right away not sure
how well you guys can see this for the
camera might throw up some b-roll but we
have ATI branding on the fans so yeah
ATI branding in 2019 I'm not even sure
who still has ATI stickers bit of a
blast from the past that one I was kind
of shocked when I saw that for our
younger viewers who don't know who ATI
is well the reason you don't know is
because AMD acquired them way back in
2006 so yeah ATI hasn't been a thing for
over a decade now anyway apparently this
is an ATI Radeon at graphics card
actually no that's not even correct
it is and I'll get this out here this is
a bit of a a laugh this one it's an 80 I
prayed Eon
yep that's a prayed Eon so that's what
the the disk here reads if only I had an
optical drive so I could read what's on
this ancient media frisbee Benny wait
what but but so getting back to the car
itself as I said I suspected it was a
bit of a scam but when I picked the
thing up for the first time I quickly
started to well I had my doubts that
maybe it's not a scam that's because it
weighs almost as much as this massive
gigabyte horas xt r RX 580 so yeah these
things are I think this is just not even
a hundred grams heavier something like
that this one here this is 830 grams so
that may surprise some of you it's a
very heavy little graphics card and that
would indicate that there is a huge
amount of copper in this thing so have a
look at that in a minute actually we'll
do that now so if we whip the cooler off
which will have a quick intermission
while I undo these four screws give me a
moment
there is only four screws holding on the
cooler so it's extremely quick and easy
to get off as you can see here it does
have a it does have an aluminium
backplate as well which is relatively
thick regal that off I've probably lost
that screw forever now
one moment obviously if I can recover it
you know I'll just look for that screw
later not super important what I wanted
to show you is this that is a very big
copper base plate it looks
I haven't actually measured it I
probably should have done that but it
looks like it's about one and a half mil
thick something like that maybe only a
mil but it is a big copper base plate
anyway it's quite heavy we've got four
nickel plated copper heat pipes but
what's really interesting what's what's
really quite bizarre about this cooler
is it is a quite a good quality cooler
the card does run quite cool but what's
bizarre is the fact that only well just
over half the thermal pads are there for
the gddr5 memory so half the memory
is just completely naked it's coming in
contact with nothing so maybe that means
EVGA are the ones that made these things
the cooler also has two aluminium fin
stacks and the smaller fin array is
connected to the baseplate via four
copper heat pipes anyway it's a pretty
decent looking cooler show about the
quality controlled those thermal pads
though and the guys at silver Knight pcs
I check the other models for me and they
found they were also missing some
thermal pads the PCB design and
componentry also looks pretty legit and
the GPU does appear to be an RX 580 it
also looks like a fairly decent 5+1
phase of erm as well so everything here
checks out throwing it in the test
system and it's definitely looking like
an rx 580 and under clocked rx 580 but
an RX 5 value all the same it has an OEM
device ID while the sub bender is listed
as AMD slash ATI again pretty funny to
see hei there of course we only have
four gigabytes of memory but there are
four gigabyte five ATS and this was
advertised to only have four gigabytes
of memory so out of the box this thing
runs at just 1,000 megahertz and that's
a locked frequency so it has no ability
to boost beyond that without you going
and manually overclocking it so that is
the operating frequency of this
particular model out of the box this to
me suggests that these cards were
intended to be mining cards and because
of this the max core clock and the
voltages have been locked to protect the
card from 24/7 mining and I'd say the
out-of-the-box specs have been
calculated for maximum power and hash
rate efficiency and that's of course to
maximize profit the memory is also
clocked at just 1600 megahertz that's
6.4 gigabits per second and not the
typical 8 key bits per second memory
with the standard bios the card can only
be overclocked as high as one point
three gigahertz and again this would be
the peak operating frequency as there is
no type of GPU boost technology enabled
I was only able to hit one point at
gigahertz for the memory and this did
limit us to 7.2 gigabits per second
using ATI flash yeah it is still called
ATI flash anyway I was able to unlock
the frequency cap and hit a stable
fourteen hundred and fifty megahertz not
amazing but that's much closer to the
full potential of an RX 580 so let's see
how that stacks up against the gigabyte
RS RX 5 80 XTi
okay so out-of-the-box the ATI Radeon
performs much like an RX 570 Judah t
heavy underclocking boosting it up to
the maximum frequency using the unedited
BIOS saw a nice 18 percent performance
boost in battlefield 5 basically placing
an umpire with this stock horas 580 then
with a little tinkering we managed 82
FPS with the 14 hundred and 50 megahertz
overclock and that's basically rx 590
performance results in Far Cry New Dawn
were quite as impressive but here the
Auris card does clock quite well still
at 1450 megahertz we were basically able
to match it despite the lower clocked
gddr5 memory performance trends scene
and show of the Tomb Raider was similar
to what we saw in battlefield 5 out of
the box we're looking at rx 570 lat
performance a little down here but not
really a big difference then a quick and
easy overclock got us to rx 580
performance and a bias flush allowed us
to hit rx 590 performance then finally
we have World War Z and here the
overclocks again got the ATI Radeon back
on track they're out of the box it was
pretty slow so there you have it the ATI
Prady on not really short to call this
thing I mean it is a 4 gigabyte R X 480
but yeah I'm going with ATI prey young
because it's kind of funny but anyway it
seems pretty clear that these things
were purpose-built or repurposed for
mining and then while the mining boom
stopped booming and then the
distributor's that deal with these sort
of gray market cards while though they
were there for thousands of them and I
suppose they have to try and make some
money off them so they turned to
boutique PC builders like silver Knight
pcs and tried to flog them off to them
but as I said the guys over at silver
Knight pcs didn't buy these in bulk and
they won't be appearing in their pre
built systems they'll be sticking to
other more well-known brands so yeah
they didn't buy them but they picked up
a couple of them and they offered some
to well guys like me I think maybe one
of them went gamers Nexus way as well so
perhaps they'll be doing something with
it but anyway that's that's pretty much
it they are currently listed over on
Alibaba as China cheap price wholesale
em D minor RX 5 OD a gigabyte ddr5 256
bit
scarred and they're selling for between
90 and 110 dollars u.s. I also noticed
over on you egg calm that you can buy a
corn AMD rx 584 gigabyte for 110 dollars
u.s. sold and shipped by corn
electronics corn electronics is a
subsidiary of corn group so basically
it's a corn cartel making their natural
progression into PC gaming alternatively
right now you can buy a refurbished MSI
rx 584 gigabyte armored card from you
egg for one hundred and twenty dollars
u.s. opposed to the one hundred and
seventy dollars u.s. you'll pay for a
brand new rx 580 from wealth the usual
suspects so is it worth saving around
sixty dollars on one of these gray
market models honestly no I don't
believe it is it's just too sketchy and
without a warranty you might as well
just buy an msi a soos gigabyte or any
other quality AIB models secondhand you
get no reassurances with these gray
market deals and as we've seen with my
particular model here and the other
models that the guys at silver Knight
pcs bought the the quality control isn't
great and then performance out of the
box isn't good either because these
weren't designed for gamers but you can
solve that but yeah for the other the
other reasons I just mentioned it's
probably not worth the time and effort
and yeah I think that's gonna do it for
the ATI pray Dion if you enjoyed this
video hit the like button subscribe for
more content that will be quite
different to this content this was sort
of a one-off for us but I thought this
was worth taking a look at because it'll
be a similar deal to things like the the
corn rx 580 probably worth avoiding
those unless you are confident you can
get some sort of warranty with them
anyway yep that's gonna do it for this
one thank you for watching I'm your host
Steve and I'll see you again next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
