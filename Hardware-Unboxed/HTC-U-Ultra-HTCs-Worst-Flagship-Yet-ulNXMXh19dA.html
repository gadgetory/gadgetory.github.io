our box today we'll be taking a look at
the HTC u ultra now I've been a big fan
of HTC for several years now ever since
they showed off the One m7 prior to that
point
HTC was mostly known for their budget
devices but with the One m7 they really
showed that they could make a
high-quality flagship handset but since
then the company has been struggling
they've had a number of poor product
launches and unfortunately for the HTC u
ultra and HTC as a company this device
is well I don't think it really lives up
to the standard that we knew of HTC in
the past some of you are probably
wondering what on earth is the HTC u
ultra well it's a flagship large screen
device it's got a 5.7 inch 1440p display
on the front it's powered by the
Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 1 SOC and it has
a 12 megapixel camera on the back it's
meant to compete with phones like the
Samsung Galaxy Note 7 which I guess
doesn't exist anymore cuz it exploded
too often and other products like the LG
v 20 but to be asked the quality there
well probably doesn't live up to what
you can get from either of those
offerings and that's something that
we'll be exploring a little bit in this
review this phone definitely feels like
a premium device in your hand it's got
glass on the front and the back as well
as metal around the sides this does mean
that it's quite a significant
fingerprint magnet the glossy back which
reflects so much light also traps a ton
of fingerprints and for those that want
to keep their device looking nice and
clean you'll have a lot of problems
keeping the HTC u ultra fingerprint free
it's also reasonably slippery thanks to
that glass back and it's quite a large
phone as well so for those of you who
are a little bit clumsy and tend to drop
your phones you might prefer something
with a metal back and for me personally
as well I feel like metal bat phones
tend to be a little bit better to use
and look a little bit better but as far
as the HTC ultras design goes there's
not a whole lot of problems with the
materials that they've used the main
problems that come with this phone and
this is something that Marcus Brownlee
covered quite well in his video review
of this device it's a really massive
phone it's only got a 5
seven inch display on the front but the
bezels around the display are enormous
especially on the bottom of this handset
it's got a huge chin and that's where
you'll find some of those navigation
buttons some of these navigation buttons
are actually reasonably difficult to hit
thanks to the size of the phone you're
trying to manage that 5.7 inch display
and hit something like the back button
while using the phone one-handed that
can be a difficult task and I wish that
HTC spent more time slimming down the
front of this handset there are some
aspects the HTC u ultras design that I
like I enjoy the fingerprint sensor on
the front I think that's a great way to
secure your device and I appreciate the
inclusion of a micro SD card slot to
expand on the 64 gigabytes of storage
you'll find inside this device something
that is not acceptable though in any
smartphone of this era is a lack of a
headphone jack this is something that
started with Apple I know some people
say oh you know wireless headphones are
better or you know the digital audio
from the USB C port on this phone is
supposedly better but for people who
have wired headphones that use a 3.5 mm
audio jack and that's the majority of
you guys out there you will not be able
to use your headphones with the HTC u
ultra and for someone like me who has a
pair of wide headphones that I wanted to
use with this device I simply couldn't
use it with the u ultra and that is a
deal-breaker
there's no USB C 2 3.5 mm audio jack
included with this handset admittedly I
wasn't given retail packaging but I
would expect in a phone like this that
you really should include that sort of
adapter and even when I tried to plug in
an on HTC adapter into this device at
USB C the 3.5 mm audio jack adapter it
told me it was incompatible with this
device and requested that I use the
headphones included in the Box this is
not acceptable behavior
HTC I want to reiterate that so clearly
to you you should be allowing consumers
to use the headphones that they want to
use with their handset even if that
means using adapter and you shouldn't
force people to use the headphones that
are included in the box this is a big
no-no for the HTC u ultra and a massive
downside to purchasing this device one
thing you may have noticed
the you ultra already is its secondary
display above the 5.7 inch 1440p LCD is
a 160 by 1040 additional display and in
here you'll find things like shortcuts
to apps weather notifications some music
controls and also contact shortcuts but
to be honest this doesn't add a whole
lot to the experience and a lot of the
things that the secondary display can do
could very easily be done just on the
regular display things like app
shortcuts contact shortcuts are all
possible on the regular home screen and
only adds a little bit to be able to see
things like additional notification info
in that additional part of the display
it also works when the display is off
you can simply pick up this phone from
your desk or tap on the top of the phone
to receive say the time and some
notification information but again
this is something that competitors have
been doing with a more LED and LCD
displays through always-on displays in
the past and HTC isn't really adding a
lot through this additional display to
be honest like I was mentioning before
if they didn't include this and slim
down the bezels I think the design of
the phone would be quite a lot better
but oh I guess HTC didn't do this with
the new ultra as far as display quality
is concerned unfortunately I couldn't
run my usual color accuracy test because
the app crashes on the Ultra for some
reason but I can tell you the maximum
brightness is 415 it's on this handset
which is a little low for modern
smartphone LCDs but it's still
reasonably visible outdoors contrast
ratio is great at 1500 to 1 and black
levels also very good but in general at
least default calibration color
temperature is a little bit too cool
though this is something that you can
modify slightly through the display
settings moving on to the performance
now and the HTC u ultra includes a
Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 1 SOC which
we've seen in smartphones effectively
since the beginning of 2016 and it may
feel a little dated when phones with the
Snapdragon 835 come out in the next
couple of months as far as performance
for today's smartphones is concerned
though the Snapdragon 820 one still
holds its own in the HTC u ultra it
performs effectively the same as other
821 smart phones that I've reviewed like
the Google pixel XL which you can see in
some of these benchmark
that we're showing here compared to some
handsets that include more powerful CPUs
in the SOC s like the Kiran 960 in the
mate 9 it's around 8 to 12 percent
slower the 821 compared to the Kiran 960
so that's just something to keep in mind
and actually reflects all of the
performers will expect from more modern
associate the year GPU performance was a
bit surprising from the new ultra it
seems like HTC is down clocking the
audrina at 5:30 in the Snapdragon 820 1
and other Snapdragon 820 one devices
produce performance even 30 to 40%
better in some GPU intensive off screen
benchmarks something like the pixel
excel for example in a you know 3dmark
sling shot test let's just say performs
about 30 percent better than the HTC
ultra and it seems like you know for
battery life and thermal reasons that
HTC has decided to reduce the
performance of the GPU somewhat that
said in modern games on Android I don't
think you'll find any performance issues
with the GPU on this device but it's
just something to keep in mind that some
other Snapdragon 820 one phones will be
faster in a GPU perspective as far as
storage performance goes this device has
64 gigabytes of NAND insight and
performance is really excellent across
the board actually really surprised me
here is some of the things like
sequential write performance which is
outstanding and also the Aranda
performance holds its own and that leads
to very fast app loading times and
general app usage on this phone it feels
like a snappy handset to use in that I
think is reflected in some of these
benchmarks here it's time to talk about
the battery life though and that's one
of the major disappointments to the HTC
u ultra for some reason HTC was only
able to cram a 3000 milliamp hour
battery into this handset when another
5.7 inch devices are pushing more like
3500 or even 4 thousand milliamp hour
batteries it's a massive disappointment
here and really hurts The Bachelor of
this device in fact I'd go as far to say
as The Bachelor life is actually
inadequate in this device for general
day-to-day usage in the PC market
battery test for example the Google
pixel XL whilst nearly 4 hours longer
than the HTC u ultra and this is a
massive discrepancy the pixel XL
performs quite well in terms of battery
life but you can see quite clearly here
that the HTC
Ultra falls well behind a lot of modern
smartphones in fact to be honest it's
almost galaxy s6 level battery life and
that was not a good device in any means
as far as battery life was concerned as
we move here to our web browsing test as
well you can see a big discrepancy from
the HTC u ultra to the pixel XL as well
and even a large screen phone like the
why away mate 9 absolutely obliterates
the HTC you hole true as far as battery
life is concerned so if you a big
battery life user you like having a
large battery and a phone that lasts all
day you definitely won't want to buy the
HTC u ultra because The Bachelor life
simply isn't up to scratch the camera is
a really important aspect of smartphones
these days and the HTC ultra is a decent
performer here it's not as good as the
Google pixel XL the galaxy s7 or the
iPhone 7 but you still get a fairly okay
camera experience it's a 12 megapixel
sensor with 1.5 5 micron pixels so it's
good in low-light here it's got an F 1.8
lens optical image stabilization and
both face detection and laser autofocus
as we bring up some of the images here
from this camera we'll just talk a
little bit about some of the good things
there's a fast shutter and good focus
times we're not using HDR that leads to
a quite snappy camera experience here
there's excellent image detail even at
100% crops from these 12 megapixel
images which shows that HTC's image
processing isn't affecting the detail of
this image significantly which can be an
issue on some competing devices there's
accurate color reproduction and metering
there's low noise in most situations and
great low-light performance with solid
noise reduction that doesn't lead to you
know that oil painting effect that you
can get from some competitors there's
some blur in images that you take in the
darkest situations but this is pretty
typical for smartphones and when you're
looking at macro photography there's
reasonable bokeh and background blur
that you can see here but nothing too
outstanding there's also a good
front-facing camera it's 16 megapixels
includes autofocus you can get some
great selfies here and there's
reasonable 4k video recording also
included in the HTC u ultra as far as
the less than good things about this
camera when you're using the auto HDR
mode which thankfully is included it can
be
it's slow to take HDR shots and the
actual quality of the dynamic range in
these photos isn't particularly amazing
especially compared to something like
the pixel excel which has a fantastic
HDR mode and great dynamic range there's
also less vibrance and you know that pop
that you can get from a really top
quality camera like the galaxy s7 or
pixel excel and while images are very
accurate as I mentioned earlier the lack
of vibrance and saturation that might go
a bit beyond what you consider
necessarily accurate makes them less
shareable for social media without some
editing you will want to put this in
Instagram maybe add some filters or some
effects here to really make those photos
as vibrant as you usually see on those
social platforms in general it's also
not as fast to take images as the galaxy
s7 or pixel excel across the board and
there's no secondary rear camera or
other amazing features as part of this
device zoom the single rear camera and
the single front camera where some other
competitors like the LG G 6 for example
have that additional wide-angle lens on
the back and now for the final section
of the review where we talked a little
bit about the software it's running
Android 7.0 out of the box with the
January security updates as well as HTC
Sense UI now I definitely wouldn't be
purchasing the HTC u ultra if you're
after a fast software updates like from
the pixel line HTC's track record for
updates it isn't terrible but it's not
fantastic either and the fact that this
device is still on the January security
patches is a little bit of a concern for
me
so if you're after fire software updates
stick to something like the pixel as far
as the actual quality of the software is
concerned I'm generally a fan of stock
Android but HTC Sense UI isn't too bad
these days they're definitely improved
it significantly in recent years to rely
less on custom elements and they've
included a design here that fits in
quite well with most of the other
Android elements that we usually see
across the operating system there's no
duplicate apps on this phone which is a
big plus there's only one Photos app one
browser and one music player which
really cuts down on the bloat where
there are some unnecessary apps included
here but I prefer including unnecessary
apps as opposed to including duplicate
apps because you won't get any of those
annoying pop-ups and in general some of
the features that they've
are simply stock Android features like
the notification pane which is
essentially the same as what you will
see on vanilla Android devices and you
get quick access to some of those
settings and things here with that HTC
messing around too much which is great
to see as far as other features are
concerned there's not too much else to
be found in the U ultras software and
that could be considered a definite
positive there are things like blink
feed to the left of the home screens
which it's actually a decent news
aggregator but I know some people have
their own apps that they use for that
and you can disable it on the U or if
you don't want it and that's like the
boost plus feature do include some handy
features like optimizing battery life
and app performance as well as the
ability to clean out some of the junk
files to free up space in your handset
those are all handy features and
additions that don't add bloatware or
unnecessary junk into the software
I think HTC has been really improving
their software over the recent years and
it's generally a fairly decent
experience provided by the U ultra not
necessarily as good as stock Android on
the pixel but good nonetheless that said
this phone does lack support for some of
Google's latest software initiatives
that you will find on competing devices
there's no Google assistant included on
the U ultra at least just yet this
feature is supposed to be coming to a
whole range of Android smartphones in
the near future there's also no support
for Google's daydream virtual reality
assistant if you were interested in
using that feature so as you might have
been able to tell throughout this review
I haven't been too impressed with a
number of aspects to the HTC u ultra
this phone is too large for a 5.7 inch
device and the additional display really
adds nothing to the experience the
battery life is very very disappointing
for a 5.7 inch handset and it's
obliterated by phones like the pixel XL
and the huawei mate 9 the camera and
performance are decent but again I
worried that they're not going to
compete with the latest smartphones and
even things like the camera at the
moment aren't as good as you're finding
the pixel XL and the biggest kicker here
the main reason why I can't recommend
the HTC u ultra to anyone is its price
this device costs 749 US dollars or 1199
Australian dollars putting it at the
upper end of smartphone pricing this is
the price you would expect to pay for an
iPhone or a Google pixel XL or something
like that
it's a
very expensive handset and to be honest
there's no reason to buy it over a
better phone like the pixel XL a better
phone like what we expect to see in the
LG G 6 and galaxy s 8 and a better phone
like the iPhone it's just not worth it
if it was a bit cheaper maybe if they
cut the price by 2 or $300 I could
potentially recommend the HTC u ultra
but at its current price it's simply a
no-go whatsoever and that's it for this
review of the HTC u ultra hope you guys
enjoyed it you can check out a written
review on Tech's bottom where you can
pour over all of the benchmarks and we
will catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
