thought it was about time I did an
unboxing boxes episode mostly because
you guys have just been asking me when
the next unboxing box's episode is and I
hadn't really planned one had a few
things laying around a couple of things
build up while we're away at Computex
earlier in the month
so I suppose now is as good as any time
to get into it so let's do that we'll
start with this box here because this
one has fragile glass fragile do not tip
written on it it's probably been tipped
a lot hopefully sounds a bit odd I'm
gonna start with this one though for a
reason sometimes we do this randomly but
this one has my Asian grocer return on
it and that sounds a bit odd but for
those of you who missed it we did do a
very silly livestream while at Computex
I just realized I picked up this and I
have bear with me it's been a while
since I've done one of these episodes
and I'm forgetting that we have a proper
or an official unboxing boxes knife now
sent to us by the guys at sky soldier
blades I'll put the link in the video
description if you want to know more
about this insane knife where was I
we did a crazy livestream while at
Computex and the plan was to just talk a
bit of tech and we've got a couple of
the local drinks I suppose from 7-eleven
that was just meant to be a fun taste
testing kind of thing that went a bit
sideways when all you guys in the
comments decided that we should mix all
the drinks together at the end and see
what that tasted like and yeah it didn't
taste good so why I bring that up is
because one of our one of our much-loved
patreon members Zed's in our hearty said
I'm going to order you something from my
Asian grocer for the next unboxing boxes
and we have a list here
of the drinks it looks like there's a
fair few drinks yep there's a lot of
drinks
he said that they shouldn't be bad or
there shouldn't be many bad ones it
should be quite interesting so Wow okay
there are a lot of drinks here what I
thought we would do is just try these
drinks out as i unbox products and i
guess i'll comment on how these taste as
i unbox new pc highway that's now a
thing at the channel i'll probably be
doing benchmarks soon while trying
interesting drinks okay so just quickly
I'll go through the drinks this one has
no English on it so that's gonna be a
mystery drink so that'll be fun
this one is calamansi juice drink
calamansi looks like it's some kind of
fruit never heard of it I don't know if
it's unusual that I haven't heard of it
but I haven't we have something else
that looks like it'll be a surprise not
sure what to expect to there mangosteen
nectar not sure if I'm pronouncing that
right again something I've never heard
of ah grass jelly drink am i well that
definitely says grass so I'm not
mispronouncing that roasted coconut
juice okay we have a six pack of Red
Bull that is pretty cool so some Asian
Red Bulls might only drink one of those
or I could be a buzzing a bit and then
this has me slightly concerned it's
probably just glass that's why it's
wrapped up weird uh put the big knife
where's my knife spotted it it's alright
you can all stop looking I have found it
yes it is in a glass bottle and it is
bird's nest with panda drink I'm not
making this stuff up that's really what
it says and yeah there's some certainly
weird stuff in there I can't wait to
drink that one anyway thankfully that
brings us to the end so thank you said
Zed are hearty I will enjoy sampling
this as we unbox and boxes or move them
or forward here
sort of semi get them out of the way all
right
well actually we probably should start
with one let's try grass jelly drink
grass jelly drink let's keep the shell
off with one of those hmm it's bringing
bringing back a lot of memories it
smells very much like some sort of
Taiwanese tea drink yeah I'll move that
over there it's not bad now these two
packages are from element a III who is
one of our patreon members so thank you
mate for sending these over I don't know
what they are this one said mouse pad
though and it feels very mouse pad ish
so hopefully this is work safe sort of
stuff we'll stick you up we end up with
you
the patreon members like to send me a
lot of unusual things like drinks and
whatnot okay well so far it's looking
like a backside of a mousepad alright
you guys ready
what are we looking at here that's up
that is cool that's awesome the Patriot
members have been hassling me to make a
mouse pad and it looks like someone has
they've got one made up but that is
awesome that is so cool
Wow I have a good look at it wow I like
that that actually looks pretty good
sitting here on this sets that's might
might be where I keep it well thank you
very much for that that is that's
awesome
that's got me bit excited to see what's
in the next box because I wasn't wasn't
expecting something that nice so
whatever is in this package has been
ordered from JM mods so you can get all
kinds of custom stuff from them so yeah
hopefully there's some cool stuff in
here and again this is from element 83
so we'll see what else sees he's ordered
but yeah more he's already won me over
with the mousepad that is seriously cool
ok we just got a bit of white foam at
this point get that out that always
makes a bit of mess in the office more
fragile handle with care' stuff so we've
got what that looks pretty cool the
episode is from JM mods you can go to JM
Montcalm to get this kind of stuff it's
looking very cool indeed first let's
start with this a big thing here we've
got a couple of thermal pads and stuff
like that so I'm not sure how that all
goes together but this is looking like a
graphics card backplate and wow wow that
is awesome Wow
so it looks like it's got LED
backlighting of some description
yeah GB lining nice flexible cable that
yeah I don't know what to say about that
that looks incredible
really nice work there by j-mods love
that and again thank you element a III
and the last little package here hahaha
that is also very awesome little
hardware unboxed think that would be an
SSD sort of cover you put that on top of
the SSDs but I mean that would look cool
just mount it anywhere in a system
really might try and put that in the
background or something you know that is
awesome really awesome
well once again thank you very much
element 83 you guys really do spoil me
sometimes loving these and I think that
deserves another drink I'm gonna put
these just safely out of the way
well I'm gonna celebrate that with some
calamansi juice see what uh I don't
really want to open it on the mousepad
Oh smells very lemony citrusy oh very
citrusy
that's lovely yeah well that's enough of
that one for now okay okay let's see
what's in this little package here so
what's in this guy you ready
oh another Google product this is the
new Corsair Vengeance RGB pro ddr4
memory and it's the 4000 kit ddr4 4000
for 8 gigabyte 6 32 gigabytes that will
be worth a small fortune let's have a
look at this stuff for those of you who
aren't aware Corsair has had RGB memory
for a while now they're in their
vengeance series and you can see some of
it there but it's not the most flashy
and showy of the RGB memories available
out there so they stepped it up a notch
with their Pro Series which they
unveiled at Computex and we featured at
one of our videos and I reckon this
stuff is now some of the best if not the
best looking GB memory on the market the
effects that does are really cool and
it's just really vibrant I'll throw up
some b-roll so you guys can see how good
they look but yeah really cool memory
and the cool stuff about this memory is
it's not just about all the flashy RGB
lighting or like kind of stuff even
though they're quite impressive in that
regard but they're available in a wide
range of frequencies so as I said this
is 4000 so that's extremely fast memory
dunno how high we got to get with
horizon 2nd gen rise and we'll give that
a go in a later video but anyway it's
some very cool memory there from Corsair
I'll put some links in the video
description so you guys can check
pricing and availability of all the
different models anyway I'm sure the
b-roll of this memory it looked very
impressive very flashy and all that good
stuff before we move on from the memory
we might try some photo pomegranate
juice drink give that a shot see what
that's all about this could be
interesting again another juice fruit
thing that I've never heard of before
this one's well I don't know how to
describe that it smells very sweet but I
can't place that it's so unusual maybe
won't get we go
yeah it's not bad it's just not that not
that much flavor to it
hey moving right along whoa
okay that is a lot of what looks to be
thermal page we've got 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
10 11 12 13 15 I think perhaps and is it
all the same is it all the same is it
all the same right so what we have here
is more than half a dozen of Arctic's a
thermal compound there mx4 stuff which I
do use on a daily basis so they sent me
a big huge tube of that not that long
ago but anyway I've used nearly half of
it so that was about time or won't be
too long before I need more and they've
set me a heap of convenient sizes so
yeah I've got loads of this stuff for
what I'm testing CPUs as you can imagine
I go through a lot of thermal paste
because every time I test or change a
CPU more thermal paste is required every
time I change a cooler more thermal
paste is required so we go through
boatloads of it so big thank you to
Arctic for sending this over so I have
to go rummaging through old product
boxes trying to find tubes of thermal
paste very handy indeed and this stuff
is really good I do recommend using it
well I'm probably not the best
performing thermal paste you can come
across it's certainly very good and
there isn't a huge amount of difference
between the various little pastes out
there
but in terms of value it is very good
it's not stupidly price like some of
them are so really good fella paste that
does the job well and lasts a long time
they've got an eighth year during I sort
of guarantee on the packet so if you are
happen to install your CPU and then not
do anything with your system for eight
years then that's really good value
we'll move that all over there I think
I'll save the old bird's nest for last
because not only does it look kind of
nasty it's also one of the more
interesting sounding ones that I can
actually pronounce
we'll leave that there we'll go for this
concoction kinda looks like an up and go
pretty sure it's not an up and go but
well I'm not pretty sure I don't really
Atari but anyway we'll give it a go and
then we'll get into the next the next
package mm that's um yeah that's that's
triggering a bit of a gag reflex there
that smells whoo that smells a lot like
the peanut rice milk that was one of the
worst absolute worst ones we drank at
Computex it was very it's had a very
strong peanut butter kind of smell which
I suppose isn't that bad but the taste
was overwhelming and it just had the the
viscosity or whatever you wanna call it
was just weird and this is this is a
little bit like that so I feel like I
should move the mouse pad but I won't
we'll give it a go mmm
okay that's actually not too bad it
smells way worse probably just because
of the experience I had not that long
ago but uh yeah it's it's okay yeah I'm
not sure I'll finish that one but Cheers
all right let's move it right along what
do we got here oh I think we have
something kind of exciting in this it
probably would have been exciting six
months ago maybe not that long ago but a
little while ago if it's what I think it
is well that sneak peek didn't uh give
anything away but if it is what I think
it is I'll have a lot of benchmark
updating to do so let's have a look
let's have a look
is it what I think it is yes it is what
I think it is can't believe it's taken
me this long I finally have a custom
Vegas 64 graphics card and I have word
that Vega 56 is on the way so I can redo
my gtx 1070 TI vs vega 56 comparison and
i will be doing a vega 64 vs GT x 1080
comparison in the next few weeks once i
get testing but yeah so these have been
extremely difficult to come by
I realize it's now quite late in the
product cycle and you guys or a lot of
you probably aren't that interested in
buying what's still a current generation
graphics card because the next
generation hopefully won't be too far
away but if you're in desperate need of
a graphics card updating your card wait
however many more months it's going to
be before we get new graphics cards then
these are an option and this is the
first time I have held this particular
model and it's the first time I've
received a custom Vega graphics card of
any description so that is a mammoth
heatsink big three fan cooler nice
backplate yeah
so hopefully that performs a lot better
than the reference air-cooled model that
I have I do have Vega 64 liquid as well
but anyway it's kind of a relief kind of
nice to finally get one of these and
sort of test it out and then we won't
have all the problems we have when we do
those comparisons where I'm using a
reference card versus a custom Pascal
card so thank you very much to a soos
for sending this along and that deserves
to be celebrated with a drink let's go
with this one here that I don't know
what it is milk is milk ease sounds like
something one of my kids would say okay
it's sort of it looks like some of the
fancy coolant you see it's kind of
what transparent almost but whitish and
it's swirling a bit and a little bit
like this stuff anyway we'll give it a
go
and it smells like nothing so hmm it's
actually quite nice but again I can't
really explain it or describe it it's
kind of like it's a fizzy drink it's a
kind of soft drink it's kind of like
lemonade I suppose is the closest thing
I can come up with it's kind of like a
nicer version of your typical lemonade
yeah quite like that I might finish that
one later I'm putting a lot of drinks
here near my expensive computer anyway
okay well we're gonna have to do a bit
of drink testing how's this I drink
drinking at the end of this one because
I'm running out of packages here you've
only got well we know what that is so
we'll get into that one last and we have
two boxes stuck together in this one
okay we have what looks to be the
world's smallest Mouse potentially in
that one and in this we have all heard a
lot about this thing this is the swift
point Z naught the swift point is edit
swift point and Z is how the makers of
this Mouse pronounce it but I'll
probably alternate between boeuf it'll
be the swift point Z yeah the swift
point is in depending on how I feel at
the time this is a very expensive Mouse
but it's also very very unique let's say
I obviously haven't used it this is the
first time I've ever got it but it has a
gyro in it and it can just do pretty
much everything you could ever imagine a
mouse doing it does pretty much more
than any other mouse that's ever come
before it I think it costs around 230
dollars u.s. so just two quick heads up
on that but there'll be some links in
the video description and check it out
and I'm not gonna even come
close to covering everything this thing
can do I quickly checked it out when
they when the makers of the mass said
they were sending it had a quick look at
it and it was quite overwhelming the
list of features and things that it
could do which you'll sort of get some
idea of in a moment as we go through
just some of the stuff that comes with
it
actually before I pull that out as you
can see it's kind of cool little kit
with the mouse plus a million little
things that can be modified on it so
honestly for unboxing boxes episode I
don't even really know where to start
with this thing I feel like you've
probably got to use it for a while to
understand everything that can do and
how it works and how well it works and I
will be using this as my daily driver
from this moment forward so the second I
wrap this episode up I'm going to take
this upstairs and start using it
straight away hopefully fit in a couple
of games tonight if I get a chance so as
I said I'm really not gonna be able to
do this one justice in an unboxing boxes
episode because there just are so many
features and aspects of this mouse and
it's kind of one of those mice that
sounds too good to be true one of those
products that sounds too good to be true
because it really sounds like a can
doodle and some of the stuff that they
claim it can do is just amazing so I
want to give it a go a really good go
and see if it is all that it's cracked
up to be but on the back here one of the
coolest features it can do is when
you're gaming to look sort of left or
right you can tilt the mouse so you can
be using the mouse as you normally would
well be gaming and then you can just
tilt it ever so slightly and your
character in a first-person shooter if
the game supports that which most do
will sort of will tilt and you can tilt
in fire rather than have any use a
keyboard control to do that so it allows
you to do a lot more with your with your
mouse controls so by default it comes
with the so the tilt piece is installed
and I can clearly feel that the mouse
rocks from left to right some it's it's
not I don't know you definitely take a
bit of getting used to it feels kind of
strange to me it feels like there's
something under the mouse but again I
haven't used it yet so I can't really
comment on how well it does or doesn't
work but then if I put this piece in if
I can work out how this piece goes in
so if you put in these pieces with the
number three on it with the little lock
that basically locks out your tilt so
now it's just a traditional Mouse that
you can't take advantage of the tilt
with then there are a heap of other
buttons so you've got your two main
clickers then there's these two
secondary clickers here and then a third
row up here and they can also be clicked
sort of you can pull them back to click
so they click upwards or you can click
down on them so there's just so many
different ways you can use this mouse
and then you can change the size of the
rubber pads that go on those clickers so
now that one's easier to access and then
these little quickfire buttons down here
you can pop the little tab that makes
that way easier to reach you've got your
normal clicker then you can pull back
and hit that one like that and then for
the one here you can hit it with your
finger like that or you could pull back
on it if you wanted to so yeah I mean if
you're pretty good at adjusting to
different mice setups then this mouse
will be something that you'll really
enjoy and for these buttons that are the
secondary buttons you can either have
that big piece there or a small one
depending on which one you prefer to
keep it more out of the way and then for
these two top buttons again there's sort
of a lower profile how well you can see
that I'm have to do some b-roll we've
got a low profile switch and then a sort
of taller profile switch less low
profile that makes perfect sense that
one sort of gets more in the way for me
but it is easy to click as well so no it
depends on what you prefer then of
course you've got two buttons here
you've got two buttons on the on the
right side as well that you can activate
with your thumb so there is a hell of a
lot of buttons on this Mouse it doesn't
say on the box but there's a lot a lot
and then comes with software so you can
program all the buttons through
different things and set it all up it
has a liftoff mode which you can use for
flight you know if you're playing
battlefield or something like that you
jump in a plane you can lift the mouse
off and use the gyro to fly so that's
pretty insane
there's a whole lot of crazy stuff this
mouse claims to do really well so
Keena start testing out and see how well
it does but again if you'll want to
check it out for yourself there is a
link in the video description and I read
a quite a few our user reviews and they
all seemed very positive there are a
couple of negative reviews as there
always is but most of them were from Mac
users who were claiming that it doesn't
work with Mac there is no that says
Microsoft or Windows and Apple down the
bottom there so I don't know if those
claims are true if they had some early
Mac Apple support issues I don't know or
it could just be that though is using
Apple products are still trying to grasp
the concept of having more than one
mouse button so that's quite possible as
well so that is an awesome-looking mouse
great little accessory kit there I'm
keen to plug that in and start testing
it to see if it really is as good as it
claims to be oh and I almost forgot
there's a second little package here
they've sent along I don't know what
this one's all about I thought at first
this might be sort of an accessory for
that Mouse if there wasn't already
enough with it but it turns out that it
is a swift point GT Mouse okay so with
this one we get a neat little carry case
little pouch thing to put it in looks
quite good open it up and we have this
thing that so what we have here is the
little USB dongle which would be a
Bluetooth or Wi-Fi dongle that plugs
into your laptop and then you can charge
this little guy using that so just clips
I like that it's very powerful the
magnets that's magnetic so that holds on
there you can actually leave it plugged
in the side of your laptop to hold it as
well so you'd plug that in to charge it
up once it's charged you just leave that
in your laptop you take this out and
this replaces your mouse so it moves
around probably need to get some b-roll
of that but it's surprisingly
comfortable and it can work next to like
your trackpad on your laptop because
it's that small it fits there quite
nicely so a really cool feature about
this little compact tiny Mouse so you've
got your left and right clickers there
you've got a scroll wheel
but the really cool thing is it's got
like a stylus tip like a sort of the
point of a stylus embedded in the bottom
there so when you're moving it around as
you normally would with them out using
you know the mouth sensor and using the
clickers you can also tilt it to the
right and then swipe it and move it
around to use the kind of stuff you
would do with a stylus art makes sort of
touchscreen stuff scrolling around
screens and stuff rather than using the
wheel to slowly scroll sideways you can
do that to sort of flick left and right
so that's really interesting again
another Mouse or sort of it's probably
more than just a mouse but anyway
another peripheral from Swift point that
I am keen to give a go and see if it's
all it's cracked up to be interesting
little device there again I will provide
a link in the video description for you
guys to check it out a bit more get a
bit more info on it I think it's time
for some roasted coconut juice what are
your a Ken Ken it's a good time for that
I've got a lot of open cans over there
better be careful not to knock any of
that off all right roasted coconut juice
let's see what that is all about well I
can confirm this bits of coconut
floating around in this juice that
doesn't smell good at all
mmm dammit alright well that smells
really bad
that's enough of that one moving right
along that go I don't even that just
tastes wrong Oh crazy bad aftertaste
okay you guys are probably familiar with
the course as new crystal 280x case but
I now have one it is in I think the
black finish which is I think probably
the better-looking finish of the two
options black and white but we'll open
this up and get a closer look at it well
I've got to say this case looks quite
good in black
I saw it only in white at Computex and I
was a bit on another file like that it
just didn't I don't know the white bits
here with the the sort of the what would
you say the tinted glass the smoked
glass it just didn't I didn't work that
well for me I didn't like it I don't
know if you guys agree if you've seen
the white one what you think but the
black one sort of blends together a bit
more looks a bit cleaner in my opinion
but basically this is a dual chamber
case Oh on this side here which is the
main chamber you can put a micro ATX
motherboard all the other bits your
graphics card and all that kind of cool
stuff then around the backside here we
have sort of the secondary chamber I
undo these yes you know sometimes these
thumb screws yet damp extremely tight
from factory but not the case here so in
the back here it looks like we can put a
pair of three and a half inch drives it
looks like three two and a half inch
drive so your SSDs and then at the
bottom here a power supply and it looks
like you're not really limited on the
length of the power supply too much
there the longer you go the less of
these cable management holes you'll have
then it looks like we've got some
lighting control in here for the fans
because it does come with a pair of
Corsair note just one sorry rewind
because it does come with a Corsair fan
in the front a 120 millimeter RGB fan so
that is quite nice nothing in the back
in fact there's no possibility for any
rear exhaust fans it looks like they
would go on the top so there is a second
RGB fan on top I know a lot about the
standard configuration of this case so a
120 millimeter
fan in the top and in the front so
that's a nice configuration there
usually don't get the high quality fans
out of the box but that's kind of cool
and then at the top here we have front
IO which is a pair of USB 3 ports no
type-c and then power and reset buttons
and you've got just your standard audio
jacks so you know fairly standard i/o
there nothing too fancy type C would
have been nice I think a few of you will
be a bit upset that's not included but
then some people claim that there's
really no need for those and they don't
use them anyway so I don't know which
side of the offense you stand on that
one and then we've got a dust filter in
it's an external dust filter as well
magnetic I think yes magnetic dust
filter that just clips on there nicely
looks like you can install a fan on this
panel as well looks like it's about the
140 millimeter variety but I couldn't be
wrong I don't have a fan laying around
anywhere so I can't confirm that right
now but yeah it has to be said I do much
prefer this case in the black finish it
just as I said it looks much cleaner
sort of goes together a bit of the white
just a it just didn't work for me so let
me know what you guys think if you think
that the black version of the 2a DX just
looks bit more sleek of it nicer and if
that's the the color choice you would
prefer and on that note I think it's
time for another drink so what have we
gonna leave the bird's nest still ok so
we have the mangosteen or mangosteen
nectar whichever one of the two that is
and yeah I think we'll just jump
straight in this one I have no idea what
to expect here enough my I've had a bit
of a cold lately so my my sense of
smells a bit off but it smells kind of
like or actually a lot like a lot like
passionfruit so it smells yeah very
sweet quite a nice smell so I don't know
if that's accurate or not but that's
what it smells like to me I'll give it a
go
hmm it's quite nice it's not exactly
what I expected but yeah it's kind of
passionfruit II kind of it's probably
the best way I could describe it but if
anyone else has had this before and they
do or don't agree with me let me know
what you think it tastes like I suspect
it tastes a lot like mango steam or
mangosteen but whatever that is all
right we'll do it we'll have the bird's
nest we're gonna outdrink the bird now
bird's nest I'll try and get some b-roll
this as well because it's um it's kind
of weird actually it's probably a way to
open that without a knife it is just a
drink calm down
Daffy to unbox everything okay I did it
so what we're having here is just your
classic bird's nest drink well I'm gonna
I'm gonna approach this pond with a bit
of caution because it smells like
nothing and generally when they smell
like nothing in my experience they're
kind of bad it's definitely not just
water hmm it's actually quite sweet
okay the liquidy part of it's quite nice
the bird's nest II part of it's quite
like quite a chunky and weird tasting
and off-putting so I noticed bad as I
thought it would be but also not
something I would like to drink not a
big Red Bull drink craft to say but I do
like the Red Bull f1 team so that's
probably why Zed Zed are Hardy bought me
some Asian Red Bulls but I do know what
a Red Bull tastes like so I'll be able
to tell you how close this is to our the
sort of western Red Bull it smells very
much like a Red Bull which is yeah
smells like it's not fit for human
consumption and it'll probably burn a
hole in your body so good Red Bull stuff
and it looks sort of the orange petrol a
color that Red Bull normally looks like
so about to see if I'm gonna get some
wings or a trip to the doctors it's kind
of like it's kind of like the Red Bull
we get better taste flat like it's not
very carbonated it's more like Red Bull
juice yeah I really like that one at all
that's disappointing I was hoping for a
nice red bull or perhaps a slightly
different version the Red Bull Red Bull
where you get but yeah it just tastes
like yeah Red Bull juice is probably the
best way I could describe it it's just
like flat so yeah that was disappointing
way to end it but nevertheless thank you
very much as Ed's and our Hardy for
sending all those drinks they were quite
interesting there are a couple there
that I enjoy so that was good
then a big thank you to element 83 for
sending not only this amazing mouse pad
which I very much love and I'll probably
end up staying here now this is just
amazing this graphics card back plate I
don't know what graphics card I should
put this on and it's really impressive I
don't know if there's a graphics card
that would would do this justice but if
you guys have a suggestion for what
cactus card I should put these
like that so your graphics cards sitting
in your computer like that and that's
how it looked from the top so let me
know what graphics card you think would
do this justice because you're I
absolutely love it it's almost too good
to put inside a PC certainly wouldn't be
putting on a graphics card that's
mounted like that because then you might
be on a set because it will be on the
backside of course and then this little
thing this little SSD cover so that
would mount up something like that if I
don't know if that's in the shot but
yeah that looks really cool as well so
I'll definitely install that in my
system anyway big thank you for sending
that stuff big thank you to a soos was
finally sending me a custom Vegas 64
graphics card and I'm looking forward to
the Vega 56 model which I'm also told us
on the way pretty keen to do some sort
of building this hopefully I have the
opportunity to a micro ATX build in the
not-too-distant future
are there any X 470 micro ATX boards you
know I don't think there is but if
someone makes one it would be cool to do
a second gen Rison building match I will
be installing this Corsair memory in a
build I might even put it in this system
here so actually I can probably shut the
system down and put it in and it could
work let's try that quickly there we go
now you can see the original Corsair RGB
memory next to the new Pro Series memory
and this the red Ripper system will have
no idea what is going on memory wise
because we just have a randomly
populated DIMM slots but that's fine
yeah so you can see them side by side
there Eric and the new stuff looks
absolutely fantastic but as always I'll
be interested to see what you guys think
so I think that about wraps up this
episode of unboxing boxes one of my
favorite episodes so far for sure we had
some some interesting drinks to keep us
as attained along the way love this
stuff of course and my mouse pad really
really cool can't can't believe how cool
that stuff is I'll get some photos and
put them on Twitter or Instagram when I
finally install in my system you may see
them in a future video who knows
thank you to Arctic for my more than one
dozen thermal paste tubes that'll come
in very handy if I get a chance to
night I will try to find it I've got
stuff everywhere
I'll give this mouse ago might try some
overwatch or something with it and a few
other games and while I am gaming with
the new swift point mouse switch point Z
or Zed
I will land on it like that one oh I
definitely didn't like that one I think
this one was so that's the okay pile Oh
apologies for that that's the roasted
coconut that's nasty
that's in the no good pile that's the
good tasting lemonade good tasting
lemonade I love that already yep
the grass jelly that was okay not great
not terrible and me pretty pretty mad so
we got three like okay drinks if you
were dying at first and there was
nothing else available they'd probably
work you'd have to be pretty close to
death to take anything out of that pile
and then this is the only one that's
actually nice and we then of course we
have the the juice ball the redbull
juice which is okay bitches pointed I
was looking forward to drinking that
whole six-pack there while I game
tonight but that's not gonna happen I
can probably come up with something
better I'll finish this one off in a
moment so anyway thank you for watching
this episode of unboxing boxes while
drinking mostly rubbish drinks hope you
enjoyed it I'm your host Steve and I'll
catch you again really soon for some
