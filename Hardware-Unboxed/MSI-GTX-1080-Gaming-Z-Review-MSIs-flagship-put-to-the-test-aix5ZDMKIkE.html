features more GT X 1080 graphics cards
and you can focus stick-up announced
today is the GTX 1080 gaming z 8g using
the latest twin frozen 6 cooler from MSI
this is the company's most extreme
air-cooled option so I'm pretty keen to
check it out there are three twin frozen
six models which are called the gaming
8g gaming xog in gaming zjg the standard
gaming model apparently misses out on
the RGB lighting in operates at the
reference clock frequencies then we have
the special x and z models both of which
featured fancy lighting and come factory
overclocked you might assume the X
version is the more extreme of the tube
that is in the case the Z actually comes
the highest clock speeds but before we
check out the clock speeds let's take a
look at the 1080 game use at 8g board
design and cooler the latest generation
Twin Frozr features talks 2.0 fans zero
frozen stay smooth heat pipes and
airflow control technology having been
very impressed with twin frozen 6
implementations on MSI's RX 470 R X 480
GTX 1060 and GTX 1070 graphics cards
we're expecting good things from this
flagship 1080 model unlike some of the
extreme cards we've seen from the likes
of gigabyte and game with this MSI model
isn't a triple slot card instead we have
a 42 millimeter wide dual slot card and
despite that it still manages to squeeze
in two large fans on top of a rather big
heat sink which is supported by a squad
of six nickel plated copper heat pipes
these heat pipes have been smooth to
ensure maximum contact with a copper
base plate which has also been
nickel-plated MSI tells us that a
premium thermal compound has been
applied to ensure optimal heat transfer
from the GPU to the base plate it looks
like pretty standard stuff but then I
guess you can't really tell how premium
a thermal compound is just by looking at
it so we'll have to take that word on it
covering the heatsink is an impressive
red and black theme fan shroud that
becomes even more impressive once the
cards have been powered up once active
the embedded LEDs make this graphics
card come to life
lighting can be controlled with the MSI
gaming app and there's a few pretty cool
effects on offer here on the rear of the
card we find a full sized backplate
which features some neat looking cutouts
along with the cool silhouette of a
dragon there's a gaming series logo as
well which is LED backlit and
pretty cool the Shroud just overhangs
the PCB taking the card to a total
length of 279 millimeters so pretty
standard stuff for a GTX 1080 graphics
card however what isn't standard is the
height this thing stands 140 millimeters
tall thanks to a super-sized PCB that
we'll take a look at now removing the
bulk of the coulomb you find two
additional heat spreaders covering the
gddr5 X memory as well as the vrm area
so that's great to see
with the 1080 gaming set a cheese strip
completely naked we get a good look at
the massive PCB and how msi has designed
this graphics card as is often the case
of high-end MSI graphics cards their
military class for grade components have
been used this is another marketing
exercise for the most part but there's
still some good stuff here such as the
super turret chokes speaking of chokes
we find a 10+2 phase design on board
which when coupled with an additional
six pin connector will be able to keep
the gtx 1080 fare with enough power to
maintain those 2.1 gigahertz overclocks
before we push the 1080 gaming zhg as
far as possible let's check out the
factory overclock settings out of the
box the card operates at a base clock of
17 33 megahertz with a boost clock of
1873 megahertz which is an 8 percent
factory overclock using the msi software
gamers can switch to an OC mode setting
which improves the base clock to 1771
megahertz for a boost of 1911 of course
thanks to him videos are unpredictable
GPU boost 3.0 technology the card will
likely run higher than 1911 megahertz
for the most part for quick and easy
overclocking gamers can refer to the MSI
gaming app which allows for quick
switching between the various operating
modes gamers can also control the LED
lighting here as well and it's possible
to enable on-screen overlay information
too
then for the serious overclocking your
MSI has their separate afterburner
utility afterburners a program I often
use for GPU overclocking but it's nice
to actually use it to overclock and MSI
card with afterburner we increase the
voltage percent to plus 100 and the
power limit to 126 percent this allowed
the core clock to be increased by 85
mega Hertz and the memory clock by 545
megahertz
GPUs there tells us this is an eighteen
sixty three megahertz base clock in a
1996 megahertz boost clock of course to
doing videos GPU boost 3.0 we know the
car can run faster than the suggested
boost clock if kept under the
thermal and power targets during our
testing the boost clock hovered between
2150 megahertz and two thousand one
hundred and eighty megahertz which is
very impressive so then I guess it's
time to see our performs to the
benchmarks out of the box the gaming Zed
is much like the other hand ten eighty
cards we've already looked at matching
the gigabyte extreme gaming in game wood
goes like hell overclocked it's much the
same story here the gaming Z average
sixty-four FPS to match the game with
GLH it's much the same story in Far Cry
primal the gaming said proves that it
has what it takes to hang with the
massive oversized cards from gigabyte in
game wood wrapping up the gaming
benchmarks a Star Wars Battlefront and
it's again the same story here that said
the gaming said did pull a frame ahead
of the game with GL age once overclocked
though that's of course in the margin of
error even with a three run average the
gaming Z isn't particularly power-hungry
when compared to the fans edition card
with a total system consumption of 271
watts overclocked it was quite a bit
more efficient than the gigabyte extreme
gaming consuming a similar level of
power as the game with GLH card
impressively the gaming said is the
coolest GT X 1080 we've tested yet with
an out-of-the-box load temperature of
just 66 degrees that's a single degree
cooler than the huge gigabyte extreme
gaming and two degrees cooler than the
game of GLH overclocked the gaming said
an extreme gaming both ran into 68
degrees so pretty impressive stuff once
again the MSI gaming Zed is yet another
excellent GTX 1080i offering that
provides top-notch performance without
making a big fuss about it even when
overclocked this graphics card runs
extremely quiet and wasn't audible over
my case fans which I have to say are
already pretty quiet to begin with as
far as I'm concerned the gaming said
ticks all the right boxes and in my
opinion is just as good as the gigabyte
extreme gaming a graphics card I liked
dearly unfortunately like the extreme
gaming the gaming said comes at a
serious price premium in fact more so
while base model 1080 is they're selling
for as little six hundred and thirty US
dollars the extreme game you will set
you back seven hundred for the premium
pack model the MSI gaming Zed is even
worse at 720 us pricing alongside the
Isuzu rog streak so C of course at these
prices what's an extra twenty dollars
that's barely a three percent bump still
at almost fifteen percent more than the
base models such as the gigabyte g1
gaming you have to wonder if these
premium
the worth of premium MSI zone GT X 1080
Seahawk card only cost $20 more than the
gaming Z at 740 us and I have to imagine
this is a better more extreme option for
enthusiasts down under the gaming Zed
cost one thousand one hundred and thirty
dollars while the liquid-cooled Seahawk
has just $10 more the gigabyte extreme
game is slightly more competitive at
$1100 though keep in mind 1080s do start
at 970 overall the MSI GTX 1080 gaming
set is a mighty impressive graphics card
I just feel the pricing is a little
inflated right now and that doesn't just
apply to MSI what do you guys think let
me know in the comments I'm your host
Matt as always and I'll see you guys
