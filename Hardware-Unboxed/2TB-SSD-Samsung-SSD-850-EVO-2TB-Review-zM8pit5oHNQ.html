your host Matt and today we have on-hand
Samsung is not so new SSD 850 Evo
released at the start of the year the
Samsung SSD 850 Evo has been around for
months now and around 380 dollars for
the one terabyte model it's a serious
deal for those seeking big SSD storage
the only tempting alternative in the
affordable SSD market is the crucial MX
200 one terabyte for a slightly more
wallet-friendly 360 dollars if you kind
of use that this says hey I can do with
a bit more storage in this drive and sit
back and relax because Samsung has got
you covered
into the new mouthwatering 2 terabyte
model now it's a serious amount of
high-speed storage unfortunately at $800
it's cheaper to purchase a pair of the
one terabyte models but if you limited
to just a single two and a half inch
band you'll require a serious amount of
SSD storage then the Samsung SSD 850 Evo
2 terabyte makes sense the reason for
the added cost over to one terabyte
models comes down to the fact that the
two terabyte model makes use of the new
Samsung MH X controller and more
importantly a 2 gigabyte lpddr3 DRAM
buffer whereas the 1 terabyte model
features a one gigabyte LP ddr2 buffer
the increased memory buffer means that
the read and write performance remains
the same with a claimed sequential read
speed of 540 megabytes per second and a
variety of 520 megabytes per second
first up here are the sequential read
results using crystal diss mark now as
you can see that 850 Evo 2 terabyte
roughly matches the smaller 500 gigabyte
Drive with 528 megabytes per second the
sequential write formats was again much
the same in comparing the 500 gigabyte
model and the two terabyte versions of
the 850 Evo both were slightly faster
than the crucial MX 200 one terabyte SSD
and slightly slower than the 850 Pro the
850 Evo 2 terabyte was surprisingly
strong when looking at the random 512 K
read performance and provided similar
performance to the 850 Pro the random
512 K rack performance is much more
competitive and although the two
terabyte 850 Evo was still faster than a
500 gigabyte
it wasn't a great deal in it the crucial
BX 100 series is surprisingly fast
measuring for K read performance
matching the 850 Pro Series the 850 Evo
is around 50% slower with a throughput
of 27 megabytes per second the 850 Evo 2
terabyte is much closer in performance
to the BX 100 when measuring 4k right
though it's still much slower than the
more expensive 850 Pro the read access
time for the Samsung 850 Evo 2 terabytes
was impressive at around twice the speed
of the crucial B X 100 and MX 200 the
right access times were similar when
comparing the budget SSDs though the 850
Evo was still able to outpace the bx 100
NM x 200 SSDs the 850 Evo 2 terabyte
performed well in the PC Mac 7 video
editing benchmark moving 280 megabytes
per second of data making it much faster
than the crucial B X 100 and ms200 SSDs
it also performed well in the PC Mac 7
gaming benchmark with the throughput of
141 megabytes per second finally we have
the storage bandwidth result from PC
mark 8 and surprisingly that 850 Evo 2
terabyte was faster than the SSD 850 Pro
with 300 megabytes per second
performance wise the two terabyte model
was no faster than the 1 terabyte model
that shouldn't come as a surprise is
even the 120 gigabyte model saturates
the stylistics key bits per second bus
that said performance was great and even
power users will enjoy the 850 Evo the
two terabyte model faces no real
competition because other than is bigger
brother the 850 Pro there were no other
two and a half inch 2 terabyte SSDs on
the market
backed by a five-year warranty in a very
reasonable endurance rating of 150
terabytes
we're gonna see how you could go wrong
with Samsung's SSD 850 Evo a 2 terabyte
model especially just 40 cents per
gigabyte this has been Matt for
