Nvidia opened up support for adaptive
sync monitors on NVIDIA GPUs I've seen a
ton of comments asking me what free sync
monitors I would recommend I guess with
free sync now working with GPUs from AMD
and NVIDIA with Intel also to support it
soon people looking at upgrading to
something new and the good news is
NVIDIA GPU owners can finally upgrade to
an adaptive sync monitor without having
to pay the g-sync tax I've done a few
monitors in the past going over some
monitor recommendations and they have
usually ended up as mostly free sync
monitor recommendations because for a
while now I haven't felt as though the
premium for J sync has been worth it
even when NVIDIA GPUs didn't support
free sync but this video is going to be
a little different in that I'll be
recommending a lot more products over
many more categories hopefully trying to
cover what most people will be looking
for I won't be covering everything
though there will be a strong focus on
gaming monitors because I assume most
people after an adaptive sync display
want adaptive sync for gaming it's not
really a necessary feature for
workstation creative or office focus
monitors so those types of displays well
they won't be talked about here as is
the case for most of our monitor
recommendations there is also a strong
focus on value products so those that
deliver the best bang for buck in any
given specification bracket I've also
made sure that every monitor I'm talking
about here supports free sync via
DisplayPort a key feature that's
necessary for NVIDIA GPU owners as well
as low framerate compensation a feature
I feel is necessary for a good adaptive
sync experience as a quick refresher low
framerate compensation or LFC is a
technique that extends the monitors
refresh rate window from the minimum
listed value to an effective refresh
rate of one Hertz so a 48 to 144 Hertz
monitor that supports LFC will
effectively support a refresh rate range
from 1 Hertz to 144 Hertz pretty much
all high refresh free sync models
support LFC but I double checked for
this video and as a result I won't be
discussing refresh rate windows all that
much
so let's kick things off with a look at
1080p monitors at this resolution there
are a number of options but most are
either 24 or 27 inches in size you can
find some 32 inch 1080p monitors but
that sort of sighs I don't think 1080p
is sufficient for a monitor you should
be looking at 1440p or higher while
there are three main monitor
technologies those are t NVA and IPS we
can rule out IPS for 1080p monitors
because there aren't any high refresh
IPS panels at this resolution so we're
down to TN and VA and the choice between
those two could depend on whether you
want something curved or something flat
TN monitors at this resolution insides
are flat whereas VA panels are curved if
this is a big factor view well I guess
we're narrowing things down a bit
further the other big consideration
between TN and VA comes down to color
quality VA panels have higher contrast
ratios and better viewing angles and
some models are more color accurate and
have a wider gamut so if you can put up
with the curve all those factors will be
an advantage however response times are
slower making TN the faster option with
less ghosting and in some cases higher
refresh rates TN panels also tend to be
slightly cheaper although that depends
on the model so let's go through my
recommendations for VA panels which I
typically prefer over TN for the reasons
just mentioned it's a clean sweep for
biotech here at 1080p I'd recommend the
vo-tech GN 24 C and GN 27 C at 24 and 27
inches respectively both pack 144 Hertz
refresh rates and new Samsung VI panels
which are pretty decent from what I've
tested in the past delivering noticeably
better colors than the 10 pounds I'm
about to go through both options also
great value the 24 inch is just $200 and
if you want the 27 inch model that's
going to be 240 us which make these
monitors some of the cheapest in its
category so these are my go-to
recommendations for 1080p gaming Moroz
however some people might want a TN
display instead either because they're
flat faster or cheaper the best value
options here tend to be the 1080p 24
inch 144 Hertz offerings you can get an
Acer GN 2 4 6 hl4 around 190 us which is
a popular choice but actually sway
towards the AO
CGT to 590 FX while this panel is the
same 190 dollars on new egg the design
is nicer the panel is decent and you get
the bonus of it being officially g-sync
compatible of course the precinct
wonders I've already talked about will
still work with invidious GPUs
through the toggle in the Nvidia control
panel but as the g2 590 FX is g-sync
compatible adaptive sync will be enabled
by default at 27 inches 1080p 144 Hertz
and TN there are any decently priced
options right now so I'd go VA in this
category the final consideration for
1080p monitors is the super high refresh
category so 240 Hertz personally I don't
think the price premium for 240 Hertz
monitors over 144 Hertz model is is
worth it right now you're looking at
over $100 more for a small increase to
smoothness at the higher refresh however
if you are interested in this refresh
rate I'd look at the $300 a set xf 250 q
at 24.5 inches and the 370 dollars xf 2
7 th at 27 inches right now basically
all 240 hertz monitors use the same a
Optronics pounds so there's no real
difference between any of the options on
the market
alright let's move on to 1440p and this
is where the market really opens up a
lot with a wide variety of options 24
inches is the easiest category to make a
recommendation in because options are
limited here you're basically stuck with
a TN panel it's a decent TN panel but
it's still 10 for what it's worth
anyway the monitor I recommend is the 24
inch 1440p 144 Hertz
IOC AG 2 for 1 QX which also has the
benefit of being chasing compatible and
it's only 310 dollars making it one of
the cheapest 1440p high refresh monitors
I'm not sure how many will be interested
in a 1440p monitor that's only 24 inches
in size but one does exist and this is
pretty much won't go with at 27 inches
1440p and high refresh there are tons of
options including all of TN VA and IPS
panels again the choice between these
technologies is similar to what I
previously mentioned in that TN panels
are the fastest and cheapest v err
panels have the best contrast ratios and
at this size are exclusively curved
while IPS provides a balance of color
quality and more
response times while being flat so let's
start with the TN option and this is the
monitor you choose if you want something
fast in terms of response times again
considering most monitors here use the
same panel I'd go for the pix UOP X - 7
6 if you can find one in stock and just
310 dots it's great value for these
specifications and I really do like the
design as well if you can't find one
you're probably looking at spending $400
on the aoc AG 271 QX which considering
the price of ba options I'm about to
discuss probably isn't a good buy right
now VA monitors in this category have
become extremely competitive lately with
lots of options thanks to a price drop
for Samsung's 27-inch 1440p 144 Hertz
and VA panels the standard option here
is biotechs GN 27 d it isn't anything
fancy but it offers basically the same
feature set as other monitors around
this price on just three hundred and
thirty dollars through amazon it's a
great buy for a free sync compatible
monitor from a brand i've tested again
this is the monitor I'd recommend for
most people while it is curved it has
better black levels than the TN option
and while response times aren't amazing
personally I'd choose colors over
response times one very important note
here relates to the Samsung JG 50 though
yes this is the same price at three
hundred and thirty dollars for the same
specifications and panel however Samsung
has chosen not to support adaptive sync
with this monitor presumably to save a
few dollars
considering the vo-tech option is the
same price but does support free sync
this is a much better choice even though
it may not be as big of a brand as
Samsung 27-inch 1440p high refresh IPS
panels are effectively a premium product
as prices start around $400 the key
benefit here is they are flat and in
most cases have somewhat superior
response times compared to their VA
counterparts however unless you're a
massive curved display hater I don't
think these factors justify the price
increase especially as VA panels also
have deeper blacks for a superior
contrast ratio the pic 0px 277 H is my
recommendation here at 420 dollars but
the GN 2070 is overall better value a
quick note on 165 Hertz Morrow's to most
of these options at 27 inches are g-sync
so the
carry a bit of a price premium starting
at $600 for an IPS version considering
there was almost no difference between
144 and 165 Hertz in practice the
massive price increase however the
cheapest 144 Hertz options is definitely
not worth it
while not as cheap as 27 inch monitors
32 inch 1440p high refresh precinct
models are also a great option right now
because I feel they're priced at an
appropriate amount higher than the
27-inch equivalents if you want the
extra size you can spend a few extra
coins without it feeling like a stretch
at this size resolution and refresh rate
we're looking at VA pounds exclusively
however the good news is there are both
flat and curved VA options at this size
the overall best option in my opinion is
the pic 0px 3 - 9 which is flat and
supports up to a 165 Hertz refresh rate
there freesync is limited to 144 Hertz
contrast isn't as amazing with this
panel of some of the best videos out
there but for 307 US dollars and without
a curve I think it's a pretty good buy
if you want a curved monitor right now
you're looking at spending a little bit
more my recommendation here goes to the
AOC AG 322 QC X again contrast isn't as
good as other VA s because it's
essentially just a curve version of the
flat panel used with the px 3 to 9 but
otherwise it's decent and this monitor
is available for a touch under $400 at
4k there aren't many good free sync
options every 60 Hertz 4k free sync
monitor on the market does not support
LFC so I can't recommend them because
the adaptive sync experience won't be
very good thanks to a narrow refresh
windows typically 40 to 60 Hertz in
these situations you have to go with
something g-sync for example the 28 inch
Acer predator xB 2 8 1 HK for around
five hundred and thirty dollars as a
teen option all the ASA predator xB 271
HK at 27 inches and IPS for a touch
under $700 there is one 4k free sync
monitor I can recommend though and
that's the a-sun nitro XV 273k a 27 inch
IPS panel with a maximum 144 Hertz
refresh rate this is essentially the
same panel as used in the g-sync HDR
monitors like the ASA Predator X 27 but
without the local dimming backlight and
at a low
cost this is a relatively new display
and it's not particularly cheap at nine
hundred US dollars but it does offer
both 4k and 144 Hertz at a compelling
price much cheaper than the x27 if you
don't care about HDR and it's better
value than the 60 Hertz IPS g-sync
option as I mentioned before due to its
higher refresh rate next up we have
ultra wise and there are lots of
different sizes and revolutions here
especially as this category of displays
is growing at a pretty rapid pace
however I'm gonna keep things simple
here and stick to 21:9 as I feel if
you're thinking of buying say a 32 9
super ultra wide there are lots of
compelling options scheduled for release
later this year that I think are worth
waiting for either as they pack higher
resolutions higher refresh rates or a
combination of the two a 21-9 the main
size to be concerned with is either 34
or 35 inches which are basically the
same any way you can get 2560 by 1080
monitors at this size but I don't think
they're worth the price considering a
good high refresh model is at least $400
as is so I feel the best value is in 34
40 by 1440 displays at the moment my
recommendation here is the msi optics ma
g3 for one C cube which is an 1800 hour
curvature uses VA Tech and tops out at
100 Hertz this uses the same 34 inch
Samsung panel as most others in this
price bracket and it's a pretty decent
panel under cutting 35 inch a Optronics
VA s and 34 inch IPS LG models by a
significant margin while offering
comparable image quality the msi variant
is 480 dollars and I think that makes it
the best bang for buck offering there
are 34 40 by 1440 ultra wives at 120 +
144 Hertz these days but we're looking
at prices over 780 dollars for these
monitors and I don't think a $300
premium over the 100 Hertz models is
worth it considering the relatively
small increase in refresh rate the final
category I want to mention is HDR
because this is the topic I get asked
the most questions about in our Dischord
community is such a large selection of
HDR monitors on the market now
recommendations for HDR displays are a
bit of a hot topic among hardware and
box viewers wanting to buy a new monitor
however I've been largely unimpressed
with free
hgr offerings the majority of monitors
advertised the supporting HDR don't
deliver a good HDR experience usually
these are display HDR 400 certified and
simply don't offer much over an SDR
presentation it's really not worth
buying a monitor with this level of HDR
especially if that monitor is priced
higher than the competition of course if
the monitors still delivers a good SDR
experience for a good price it could be
worth considering but there's no reason
to spend more only to receive crappy HDR
in return so far I haven't seen a single
freesync monitor that delivers a good or
real HDR experience so my recommendation
right now is not to buy a free sync
monitor for its HDR functionality yep in
my opinion there is no freezing gauge gr
monitor where the free sync to or
otherwise there's worth buying it
because the HDR support simply isn't
good enough this is largely because
there are only a limited selection of
monitors that have a proper full array
of local dimming backlight which is
necessary to achieve the contrast
requirements of a good HDR experience
with an LCD panel outside of invidious
g-sync ecosystem F Ald back lights are
reserved for high-end professional-grade
displays which tend to be expensive and
not well-suited to gaming due to limited
refresh rates I hope this will change in
the future I hope we get some decent
affordable fruits and kamana meters with
an F Ald backlight that's suitable for
gaming but right now they pretty much
don't exist the closest to a good HD
experience you'll get right now is with
Samsung's chg series and the free sync
side however as these are edgelet
locally dimmed panels they're only semi
HDR in my opinion not true HDR displays
now across these recommendations I've
mostly focused on quality panels with
good specifications and this tends to be
pretty straightforward considering in
anyone's spec category most monitors end
up using the same panel in my opinion
the panel is the most important aspect
to a monitor which is why I'm
comfortable recommending brands like
fire tech that don't pack in as many
features as say and equip on a sous
monitor things like cheap crosshairs RGB
lighting headphone stands FPS counters
and so on don't really interest me all
that much so these things didn't really
factor in whatsoever there are some
reasons I would consider a more
expensive monitor of
those I listed for example if it comes
with a height-adjustable stand where the
option I recommend doesn't offer its
factory color calibrated unfortunately
though not many gaming monitors are
factory calibrated that's more of a
professional-grade feature so unless
you're spending hundreds of dollars more
you're unlikely to get a calibrated
monitor at a good bang for buck price
that said these are just suggestions and
recommendations if there's a particular
feature you're after that my
recommendations don't have of course
just do your research read reviews
because there are lots of other good
models out there that I haven't
mentioned here and of course pricing may
also vary if you're in other regions
like Europe or Australia because I've
recommended a lot of products in this
video here's a quick summary that goes
over everything with up to date prices
as of this video being made if you're
interested in current prices we have
links in the description for that anyway
that's it for this video hopefully this
has helped any prospective adapter
similar buyers make a choice as to what
they should go with seems like there's a
lot of excitement in the Nvidia chip you
own in community right now about having
access to a wide range of adaptive sync
motors which is always good as always
