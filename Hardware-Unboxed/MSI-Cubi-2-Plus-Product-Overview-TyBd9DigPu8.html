computer from well-known motherboard
maker MSI called the q2 plus the small
form-factor PC is based on the new Intel
mini STX form factor which sees the
motherboard measure a tiny 5 inches by 5
inches this typically means mini STX
computers are slightly larger than the
NUC counterparts but without added size
comes a number of worthwhile advantages
PC enthusiasts will no doubt take notice
of the QV 2 pluses upgrade ability for
things like the CPU memory and storage
that's right inside this tiny package
you'll find an LGA 1151 socket 2x o DIMM
slots and a pair of em 2 slots for
taking a peek under the hood let's get a
closer look at the q2 + design and check
out the connectivity from the front we
have quite a busy looking device that
looks a bit like 2 separate small
form-factor pcs sandwich together
I assume they'll be models without the
attached bottom section which includes a
pair of USB 2 port and an SD card reader
for good measure above that we have the
storage device LED indicator and an
infrared receiver while to the left of
that are two more USB ports this time
we're lucky enough to get a USB 3.1 type
CD port though oddly enough next to it
lies another USB 2 port where's the type
a USB 3 port MSI up top we find a snazzy
looking power button that blends into
its triangle ish square surroundings
then to the right we find an interesting
looking rubberized strip that's hiding
yet another freaking USB 2 port but hey
at least this one supports msi
supercharger technology which allows
users to charge the devices even when
the system is powered off well I do
appreciate the single USB 3.1 type C
port up front my external USB 3 storage
devices certainly would have appreciated
single USB 3 type-a port I mean a
standards only 8 years old now spinning
the cube u 2 + around we find what I've
been looking so desperately for a pair
of USB 3 ports why these USB 3 ports
hiding around the back when we have 4
USB 2 ports up from there must be a good
reason I just can't think what it would
be around the back we also find a
gigabit network port along with HDMI and
DisplayPort outputs these worth pointing
out that there's an alternate
configuration which includes two HDMI
ports along with the display for
output but this might not be
particularly useful as the h 110 chipset
only supports dual monitors it's also
the DC power jack which connects to the
included 90 watt power brick apart from
all the ports just mentioned a large
section of the rear i/o has been
dedicated to cooling the rear grille has
been made from a series of triangles
which do look quite restrictive so it'll
be interesting to see how much this
impacts cooling performance underneath
there are four rubber feet each of which
includes a Philips head screw in the
middle removing these screws allows the
base cover to be removed and after a
little more work it's possible to gain
access to the motherboard inside we find
the MSI MSB one two three a tiny little
mini STX motherboard that's been custom
built for the qb2 plus at the heart of
this motherboard is the H 110 chipset
enticements basic desktop offering
having said that this chipset offers
more than enough features for this tiny
PC onboard we find a pair of s o DIMM
slots supporting up to 32 gigabytes of
ddr4 memory
assuming you can find 16 gigabyte
modules given this little PC specs we
feel a gigabytes of memory will be
plenty while 16 gigabytes could have
been considered overkill that being the
case I went with overkill using a pair
of Kingston 8 gigabyte ddr4 2133 modules
I suggest getting 2 modules to take
advantage of the sky processes dual
channel memory controller along with the
dual DIMM slots we find 2 m2 slot one
for a Wi-Fi module and the other for a
higher speed storage device for testing
I went with my samsung SM 951 512
gigabyte SSD since my 950 Pro was
otherwise engaged
those wanting to take advantage of
larger storage devices will like the
fact that a two and a half inch serial
ata hard drive or SSD
can also be installed in the bottom of
the device now because the QB 2 plus is
classified as a barebone PC as we've
just seen you have to bring your own
memory and storage however the CPU comes
pre-installed it is part of the upfront
cost the q2 plus supports of 6
generation Intel skylake s power saving
processes and you can choose between the
core i3 6100 T Core i5 6500 T or cry 7
6700 T because I'm cheap I went with the
6100 T which features just to cause
operating a 3.2 gigahertz it does
support hyper threading so there's four
threads on offer making the solution
plenty of snappy for general computing
still if you require more power the 6500
T boasts four cords operating with
two-and-a-half years
turbo frequency of up to three point one
gigahertz then there's the 6700 T which
also features four cores the hyper
threading support means there are eight
turns to work with and they operate it
between 2.8 and 3.6 gigahertz MSI's
going the laptops are CPU cooler
complete with the brushless blower from
power logic the heat sink features a
copper base the maximizing cooling
efficiency is a pair of copper heat
pipes which help transfer heat to a
small bank of aluminium fins also
included as standard is an Intel dual
band wireless AC 3165 Wi-Fi adapter
which like the processor comes
pre-installed all out the QB 2 plus
weighs 1.2 kilograms and measures 148
millimeters wide 155 millimetres deep
and just 62 millimetres tall the
all-black design looks sleek and I can
see this tiny PC fitting in nicely to
just about any setting finally for those
buying the QV 2 pluses of barebone
be aware the msi doesn't include any
software in the package so is this a
little STX you'll be considering let me
know in the comments have a great day
and I'll see you guys next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
