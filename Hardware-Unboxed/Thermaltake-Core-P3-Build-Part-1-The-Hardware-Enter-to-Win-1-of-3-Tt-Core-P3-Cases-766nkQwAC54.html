latest chassis in their unique open
frame wall-mountable core p series the
core p3 late last year we saw the
arrival of the core p5 and since then
the pc modding community has gotten wild
with this case
creating loads of amazing custom
liquid-cooled builds given the success
of the p5 thermaltake has been looking
to create yet another case to entice
models that case was announced early
this month and is now known as the core
p3 and it's surprisingly similar to the
p5 in many ways well being quite
different at the same time let me
explain essentially what we have here is
a miniaturized version of the p5 however
this isn't a mini ITX or even micro ATX
version rather standard ATX motherboards
are still supported despite being a
little over 30% smaller the hardware
support remains much the same as popular
as the p5 was many complained about its
size even for a case supporting the ATX
form factor it was still pretty big
unless you went all-out with the liquid
cooling the p5 had a lot of wasted space
the p3 corrects this while still
offering plenty of room for extreme
liquid cooling setups prior to the p3 s
release then will take us for I'd like
an early review sample and well how
could I turn down an offer like that
having seen all the epic hard pipe
liquid cooled p5 cases online I thought
it'd be cool to try and make one of my
own completely ignoring the fact that I
haven't really played around with custom
water cooling before I promptly fired
off a cheeky amount of thermal take
asking if they'd supply the hardware for
a custom hard pipe liquid cooled p3
build to my slight surprise they came
back and said sha Matt that sounds great
let's work out what you need from the TT
premium store and we'll make it happen
with that I didn't hesitate for a moment
then began shopping before long I made a
list of over a dozen individual parts
that what I'd hoped would make for an
awesome build Thermaltake agreed to
sponsor my spending spree which totaled
well over $1000 dollars for all the bits
along with the p3 case and their new
tough power RGB gold 850 watt power
supply
shortly after all that everything
arrived and a quickly dawned on me that
I had almost zero experience with this
stuff thermaltake he made a big
investment in this video so I couldn't
let them down
so then other than all the great-looking
thermaltake gear what else was planned
for the build at the heart of the build
thought as rocks x99 Taichi motherboard
will look the part plus I've received
about 10,000 requests for review of this
thing this new external onboard sports
an amazing looking black and white theme
with a nice pattern splashed on the PCB
the board doesn't just look pretty
either there's some great features on
board to features such as purity sound
three julienne tail Gigabit LAN a 12
power phase design dual band AC Wi-Fi
dual altar m2 slots
USB 3.1 and much much more included what
shocked me the most about the x99 Taichi
is the price incredibly it costs just
220 us or $300 dollars for a motherboard
of this caliber I would expect to pay a
lot more in keeping with the black and
white theme of as rocks externally
ngayon Taichi g.skill is graciously sent
along one of their tried and said 64
gigabyte 32 hundred megahertz
black-and-white ddr4 memory kids priced
at around 450 US dollars or $650 dollars
this memory isn't cheap though this is
the asking price for 64 gigabytes of
ddr4 3200 the new tried and said
Callaway looks amazing and this black
and white memory is going to look right
at home and our p3 build for storage
I'll be installing a single kingston UV
400 480 gigabyte of solid-state disk
which is actually a pretty sensible
cost-effective option so i'm not sure
how that happened
just kidding it's new and it's also
going to suit the build to a team anyway
at 125 US dollars 165 odd z dollars the
UV 400 480 gigabyte is a very affordable
SSD performance wise it's very much what
you'd expect from a modern SATA 6
gigabits per second SSD of course if you
want something with a little more punch
a pair of samsung 950 pro m2 SSDs can be
installed as well rather than use my
insanely overpriced core i7 6950 x4 this
build are we going to previous
generations 59 60 X since this will be a
gaming machine unless it has well a your
Broadway lyricist would work just as
well
that said the 59 60 X wasn't my current
gaming rig and since I plan to make the
p3 my new gaming machine I brought it
over
speaking of gaming the nvidia geforce
gtx 1080 founders Edition will be my GPU
of choice wait what why the fans edition
I hear you say yep there's a reason I'm
going to use this and it has to do with
all that thermal take liquid cooling
gear you might have seen me unboxing the
Pacific GTX transparent 10 series
founders Edition waterblock earlier this
week
well this Bluffs going to be installed
on the founders edition 1080 in this
build so I hope the graphics card choice
makes more sense now powering all this
Hardware is the new tough power RGB Gold
850 watt power supply this unit sells
for 180 us and although it's yet to go
on sale down under I'm told the
recommended retail price is $229 this
power supply comes complete with a 140
millimeter RGB fan and features a 100%
Japanese capacitors ideally for this
build its 100% modular and I'll be using
TT mods blue and black sleeve cable
extensions to making up the rest of the
system a heap of bits and bobs from
thermal tape keeping the core i7 1506 TX
cool will be the Pacific w3 CPU water
block this block features extremely thin
point one five millimeter fins connected
to a copper base which maximizes heat
extraction and prevent corrosion showing
all this off is a high quality PWM a
cover that allows users to see directly
through the water block the next piece
of the cooling puzzle is the dual 140
millimeter fan radiator notice the
Pacific RL 280 thermaltake status
radiators been constructed from
high-quality German zinc alloy aluminum
and aerospace grade materials it's
available in configurations of 140
millimeters 280 millimetres 420
millimetres and 560 millimeters pumping
air through the radiator will be a pair
of ring 140 millimeter blue LED fans
then we have the Pacific PR 22 d5 silent
kit reservoir and pump combo the acrylic
tank can hold 300 mil of liquid while
the pump features a maximum flow rate of
1135 liters per hour this version of the
pump includes an aluminium kit that not
only hides the ugly pump but also helps
to reduce noise hopefully directing the
liquid Rhodes meant to go a thermal
takes v to blur ptg tubes in total I've
got 4 1 metre tubes and depending on how
well things go I suspect I'll only need
two of them helping things progress as
planned would be the pacific hard to
bender kid a must-have item at $98
finally finishing the system off and
hopefully giving it that hardware in box
blue Lucas Thermaltake C 1000 blue
liquid coolant made in Germany the C
1000 opaque coolant is virtually
odorless non flammable and high
performance liquid offering superb
protection for copper nickel brass and
aluminium so the plan is now to install
all this hardware into the p3 which I'll
do shortly in an upcoming video entitled
part 2 component install
a simple way of saying what have I got
myself into that'll be followed by part
three the liquid cooling where I'll no
doubt have a blast bending tubes at all
the wrong angles finally part four will
include some good old-fashioned
benchmarks and a look at the CPU and GPU
temperatures assuming the GTX 1080s
survives the ordeal in part three now I
actually have an awesome announcement to
make
I've teamed up with thermal tey to give
away three yes three of these awesome
Corp III cases and the competition is
international so three lucky viewers are
going to be receiving the exact same
model case I'm using this build all you
have to do to enter is head over to
Hardware unbox comm sign up for the
forums and post up a photo of your
current rigs some info about your specs
and a short explanation of why you want
the Corp III good luck for the
competition and let me know what you
guys think in the comments I'm your host
