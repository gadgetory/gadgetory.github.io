recently i've seen a huge amount of
comments on our archie ex 2060 gtx 660ti
and 1660 coverage celebrating how fast a
vega 56 has become quite a few viewers
have claimed that vega 56 is now caught
up to the gtx 1080 and I suppose that's
been brought on because we have seen
quite a few impressive results recently
new titles such as Forza horizon for
dirt rally 2.0 and a Resident Evil 2 for
example and that's pretty impressive it
also certainly seems like progress given
back when I first reviewed Vega 56 in
late 2017 out of the 25 games tested at
beat the GTX 1080 in just a single title
dirt for using CM AAA this meant on
average it was 14% slot on the GTX 1080
at 1440p certainly not a bad results at
the time but I wonder in 2019 has that
margin shrunk since so many of you have
asked me to look closely at the GTX 1080
and Vega 56 comparison I thought we
might as well do that however when I
make these sorts of videos I always run
into the issue of not being able to
please everyone if I only compare to
Vega 56 week the GTX 1080 I'd get Vega
56 was never meant to compete with the
GT X 1080 unfair comparison you shal
unsubbed
then if I only compared value 56 with
the gtx 1070 i'd get the gtx 1070 i was
released for a reason unfair comparison
you shal unsubbed I guess I could just
compare Vega 56 to the gtx 1070 TI
but that's not really the comparison
many of you have been requesting so to
cover all my bases i'm going to see how
vega 56 stacks up against the gtx 1070
1070 TI and at 1080 and 37 games at
1080p and 1440p you happy good let's get
on with it for this one we'll be looking
closely performance at 1440 paint about
a dozen titles and then we'll jump to a
37 game breakdown comparing vega 56
head-to-head with the gtx 1070 and 1080
the graphs also include 1080p data but
i'll skip over discussing that purely to
save time finally the test system used
in
a quarry 999 hurricane clocked at 5
gigahertz with 32 gigabytes of ddr4
3,200 memory ok let's get into the
results performance in shadow of the
Tomb Raider hasn't changed since our
original testing but that's good news
for AMD as Vega 56 is just a few frames
long the gtx 280 and well ahead of the
gtx 1070 it's certainly not a win over
the 1080 but it's almost close enough to
call a tie at least 1440p anyway moving
on AMD hit the ground running in Forza
horizon four and it's been a solid title
for them ever since release as you can
see Vega 56 beats the GTX tannerite are
both tested resolutions and was 5%
faster at 1440p not a massive win but
then any win over the GTX 1080 really
can be considered a massive win for Vega
56 generation zero is a newly released
title and a few patreon members
requested that I add it to our battery
of game benchmarks so here it is
AMD look as though they're yet to do
much optimization work and this one is
Vega 56 does fall behind even the gtx
1070 so that is a bit of a shame yes
anthem I'm finally testing with it for
the first time I actually bought this
game with our patreon money before
release apologies to all our amazing
patreon members for effectively wasting
that money anyway because the game
tanked I never actually installed it
that is until now not sure what to tell
you really I was just trying to get to a
40 game benchmark with this fun Vega 56
does quite well at 1440p edged ahead of
the gtx 1070 i by amie 4% margin to come
in just 5% slot on the gtx tane so
overall quite a good result as was the
case with dirt for the radeon GPU is
completely dominating dirt to here Vega
56 outpaced the GTX 1080 by 7% margin so
it's obviously a great result for the
red team and I can see why people are
starting to believe Vega is making a
late charge with results like these the
GTX 1080 and Vega 56 are evenly matched
in the division to the GeForce GPU just
managed to energy ahead by a few frames
very Vega 56 did just that when looking
at the 1% low performance so as I said
they are very evenly matched performance
is also competitive in Far Cry new
donnas GT X 1080 was a few frames faster
on average while both produce
the same 73 FPS 1% low result needless
to say Vega 56 performed much more like
a gtx 1080 in this title than did gtx
1070 TI and it pretty well smoked the
vanilla 1070 moving on we have apex
legends and here all four GPUs performed
very well at 1440p that said Vega 56
edged out the gtx 1070 TI very this one
is basically close enough to call a tie
the GT X 1080 was 11% faster so a
reasonably comfortable victory for
NVIDIA is more expensive GPU in this
title Ace Combat 7 skies unknown is
another patron requested game so
naturally I've added it that said it's
not a particularly great title for AMD
and we're starting to see a bit of a
trend T with these lesser known games
seems AMD just doesn't have the budget
to optimize for everything moreover a
lot of these games are likely developed
using Nvidia hardware anyway Vega 56 was
slower than even the gtx 1070 in this
one and making it 26 percent slower than
the GTX 1080 next up we have Rainbow six
siege and here Vega 56 just edged out
the GTX 1080 at 1440p despite winning
rather comfortably at 1080p anyway this
is at the very least to tie and that's
an exceptional result for the radio and
GPU it also meant that vega 56 was 19%
fast and the gtx 1070 in this title the
strange brigade results are quite
interesting here vega 56 managed to
match the average frame rate of the gtx
1088 1440p but was down quite a bit for
the 1% lower result and we often see
this with AMD GPUs in this title still
the 1% lower figure wasn't horrible and
Vega 56 did manage to match the gtx 1070
TI so overall another good result for
AMD now this is very interesting back
when I did my 40-something GPU benchmark
of battlefield 5 Vega 56 was actually
11% slower than the GTX 1080 at 1440p
the games now gone through several
patches since then an AMD has released a
plethora of driver updates I'm also
testing a slightly different section of
the game but I'm certain that last point
doesn't account for the difference we
see here today from 11 percent slower
upon release Vega 56 is now 5 percent
faster than the GTX 1080 at
when comparing the average framerate
performance the one percent low
performance is a little weak but even so
it's still edged out the gtx 1070 TI
here overall very impressive stuff from
the red team in battlefield 5 Metro
Exodus is an nvidia sponsored title so
not terribly surprising to see vega 56
trailing the gtx 1080 by a 13% margin
vega 56 finds itself slotted in between
the gtx 1070 and 1070 TI and this one so
not a bad result but I feel with some
optimization work we would be looking at
a better result these are the
performance figures we got in late
January when testing Resident Evil 2 for
the first time and the layers display
drivers don't change anything here so
Vega 56 retains its win beating the gtx
10a by a 5% margin though they were
basically identical we're comparing 1%
low performance at 1440p still this is
an exceptionally good result for Vega 56
I think based on what we just saw there
it's pretty clear that Vega 56 hasn't
actually caught the GTX 1080 at least
not overall but there certainly were a
few impressive results I suspect it's
doing a little better than the 14% loss
we saw in our day 1 coverage so let's
jump over to the 37 game breakdown and
take a close look at the current
situation ok so this time out Vega 56
was found to be just 9% slower than the
GTX 10a on average across the 37 games
tested impressively it enjoyed big wins
in Rainbow six siege and dirt 4 though
neither are particularly new titles
while it was also faster in dirt rally
to Forza horizon for Resident Evil 2 and
battlefield 5 there were a few games
where Vega 56 gets shafted may include
Assassin's Creed Odyssey Ace Combat 7
project cars 2 and World of Tanks still
overall a pretty positive 2019 test for
value 56 it's also really interesting to
note that while Vega 56 was just 2% fast
and the GTX 1070 back in late 2017
it's now 9 percent faster and better
still it was slower by more than a 5%
margin interest three of the 37 games
tested while it's faster by more than a
5 percent margin in 23 of the titles
tested
so in conclusion yes value 56 is
certainly looking better today than it
did
release so that is good news the bad
news being that none of these Pascal
GPUs featured in this video value 56 is
current competition today Vega 56 is
priced at best to compete with the RT X
2060 and at worst the RT X 2070 given
the ITX 2060 is 7% faster an average
that paints Vega 56 into a rather tough
spot and as I said in my RTS 2060
coverage unless you can get Vega 56 for
$300 or less I wouldn't bother
hopefully AMD can make more of an impact
with na'vi soon we can only hope and
that is going to do it for this one if
