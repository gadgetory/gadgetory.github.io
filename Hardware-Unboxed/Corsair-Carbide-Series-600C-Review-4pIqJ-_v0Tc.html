I'm your host Matt and say we've got the
first look at the corsair carbide 600 c
inverted ATX case Corsair is a well
liked and often utilized company for the
variety of products and the range of
cases covers nearly every nook and
cranny of the market today we're taking
a look at a product that fills one of
the few gaps to have left the carbide
600c is an inverted motherboard ATX case
there's much more to the 600 C than its
motherboard orientation party trick
however the design and build quality is
excellent and the case gives a high-end
first impression with its sleek and
elegant appearance the front sides very
minimalist presenting just two panels in
the Corsair logo at the bottom right the
panel itself is mostly plastic
however the face has been wrapped in a
sheet of painted steel which gives it
that premium look and feel the upper
panel is actually a clever little door
that opens up to reveal a pair of five
and a quarter inch drive bays courses
attention to detail is on show here with
the door panel sound deadening
insulation and a small set of magnets to
keep the door closed the entire front
panel is removable by six tabs inside
the case moving on to the sides of the
case
there's not much to mention on the left
just a nice steel panel that slides on
and is secured by a pair of screws at
the back the right side however is a
brilliant hinged door made from tinted
acrylic that allows you to show off and
easily access your upside-down hardware
which can be quickly released by the
sliding door handle at the front the
door can also be completely removed
easily when you need to do so up top
there's another simple steel facade with
nothing bid neo panel featuring two USB
to ports two USB 3 ports two audio jacks
a 3-speed fan controller and your power
and restart buttons on the back side
you'll find a 140 millimeter fan grill
and motherboard i/o cutout at the bottom
followed by eight expansion slots and a
vertical grill for air flow
finally at the top is the removable
power supply bracket as the world gone
topsy-turvy finally lined by a large
magnet attached to dust built on the
bottom of the case features four large
feet that will allow
pays for bottom mounted fans if
necessary now let's take a look inside
as expected from Corsair the internal
design is great the motherboard trade
features a large cutout which allows for
aftermarket cooling and cable routing is
be catered for by four large grommets
one at the top of the case and three
running vertically down the front end of
the case behind the motherboard tray
there's between 25 and 35 millimetres of
space for excess cabling and coarser has
included some handy tabs to zip-tie
cables to cooling wised all of the
supplied fans cater to the main section
of the case rendering three and a half
inch bays up top to them for themselves
and the PSU is also limited to air
supply from the front intake fans which
we hope won't be a problem to front
intake fans have draw the air in while
one exhaust fan the back will pump the
air out but you can also install
additional fans at the bottom of the
case as mentioned in terms of radiator
space the bottom of the case can support
sizes up to 360 millimeters the front
can handle 280 millimeters and the rear
is limited to 140 millimeters there's
plenty of room for CPU coolers with
space for aftermarket coolers as tall as
200 millimeters there's plenty of space
for your graphics card too with the 600
C excepting lengths after 395
millimeters without interfering with
anything else inside the case at the top
of the case the repair of plastic panels
that shield the drive bays from view
which can be removed at the user
discretion and the opposite side also
grants access for installation of the
power supply and drives to all up the
600 C allows for installation of two
five and a quarter inch drive bays two
three and a half inch drive cages and
three two and a half inch drive cages
which isn't a huge amount of storage
considering the case of size however it
will be sufficient for most users the
three and a half inch bays feature quick
and easy to lose cages and the clever
two and a half inch slots don't even
require removable trays now it's time to
have a look at our building
installations despite a sixty three
litre capacity the 600 C is still just a
mid Tower so while it's got plenty of
room it isn't designed to fit ridiculous
amounts of hardware inside for our build
we decided to go with an AMD rig at
least for the CPU which is
something we've done yet it's a thumbs
up for a little AMD FX loving the
motherboard of choice is the MSI 970
gaming which has been pre fitted with 16
gigabytes of Corsair Vengeance ddr3 2133
memory and the FX 8350 processor once
the motherboard was installed inside the
600 C we fitted the massive nock to our
NHD 15 which fit with ease the
installation was aided by the fact that
the motherboard tray provides a huge
cutout for access to the rear side of
the CPU socket multiple GPUs fit easily
and it's even possible to get up to four
cards inside at once which we can't
picture many 600 Sione's wanting to do
but the option is there for something
slightly more realistic we went with a
pair of g-force gtx 980ti graphics cards
but should provide plenty of GPU power
for 4k gaming powering the FX 8350 and
it's battery of 980ti graphics cards the
silverstone Strider gold S series 850
white gold certified fully modular power
supply
finally for storage we equipped the 600
C with a pair of crucial BX 209 60
gigabyte SSDs and a crucial MX 201
terabyte SSD the two three and a half
inch drive bays were fitted with a pair
of Western digital black six terabyte
hard drive some big capacity storage the
Carbide series 600 C was great to work
with thanks to a spacious interior and
practical design tucking away the cables
at the rear was easy to once everything
was installed the system looked clean
tidy and anything but cramped for
temperature testing we overclocked the
AMD FX 8350 processor to 4.7 gigahertz
and surprisingly under load the CPU
temperature never exceeded 50 degrees
which to my knowledge is very low the
reference design geforce gtx 980ti has
never exceeded 83 degrees and when idle
is just 30 degrees with an ambient room
temperature of 21 degrees
overall the 600 C is a really nice case
both aesthetically and functionally well
it does kind of look like a mini fridge
to in front I really like to clean a
minimalist design
well it's wide design won't suit this
space conscious particularly well
users who frequently upgrade their
hardware will enjoy the spacious and
of the interior and ears of internal
access as well as the opportunity to
show off their gear in a new and
interesting way upside down we had
concerns about cooling G of the location
of the supplied fans but the proof is in
the pudding this 600 C called just as
well as other cases in its class
I think Corsair is on to another winner
here with the carbide Sirius 600 C which
we expect to come in at around $150 upon
release thanks for watching another
