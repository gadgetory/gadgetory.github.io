video now this one features many many
benchmark runs though most of them you
won't actually see but I'll get to what
that's all about in a moment back in
January I made a series of videos
discussing why right now is a bad time
to build a gaming PC and all I really
did in that series was deliver bad news
so sorry about that more positively
though I have recently been revisiting a
few older graphics cards to see how they
hold up in today's games and I found
that GPUs such as the GTX 680 r9 280x
and even the GTX 760 still perform very
well in the latest games using medium
quality type settings at 1080p the GTX
680 and r9 280x were comparable to the
GTX 1050 Ti in terms of performance but
at today's prices can be had for around
the price of a gtx 1050 or rx 560
meanwhile the GTX 760 cost about as much
as a GT 1030 but offers way more
performance of course there's always
been bargains to be had when shopping
for use graphics cards so none of this
is terribly surprising however we're a
secondhand shopping is usually reserved
for bargain hunters today with the way
prices are many more gamers are
considering buying a used graphics card
with so many options available it's
really hard to work out where to even
begin do you work at which GPU you want
or do you work out what your price range
is but then how do you know how much you
should be spending on a particular model
it's all a bit complicated really so to
try and make the process a lot easier
I've spent a huge amount of time working
at the average selling price for each
model and then the average performance
to work out the average selling price
I've turned ebay calm so all the figures
are in US dollars it really wasn't an
option to do some more currencies if I
ever wanted to see my kids again still
for the most part this information
should translate quite well into other
markets of course pricing is just part
of the puzzle and it was the quicker and
easier part of this puzzle to work here
far more time-consuming and difficult
was benchmarking all 44 graphics card
in three different games by providing
all of this data though it means that
you guys can quickly and easily work out
how each of these graphics cards
compares in real-world games which I
feel is significantly more useful than a
quick and easy to run synthetic
benchmark so for this I really wanted to
test games that are fairly neutral and
by that I mean don't favor one
particular brand of GPUs therefore I
looked back at one of our recent 35 game
benchmark comparisons which featured a
gtx 1016 and rx 580 along with the gtx
1070 and vega 56 and I chose the games
where these graphics cards delivered
similar performance to one another this
led me to choose battlefield 1 f1 2017
and rise of the Tomb Raider all of which
we tested using the DirectX 11 API with
the medium quality settings at 1080p
frame rates for all the graphics cards
were higher in battlefield 1 and F 1
2017 while they were about 35% lower in
rise of the Tomb Raider so this caused
some issues for the lower end models but
I still feel like this is a good example
of what you can expect to find from
modern games using mild quality settings
before we get to the french ii results
though let's talk about the average
selling price of each model okay so what
you're looking at here is the average
sale price for the GeForce graphics
cards so far during the march period and
I've included all the GeForce 500 600
700 and 900 series GPUs there are 20
different models here so a wide and
varying range of options and please note
pricing has been rounded to the nearest
five dollars for a bit of context on
just how bad graphics card prices have
gotten as if you needed it here is the
average selling price information for
the September 2017 period as you can see
graphics cards such as the GTX 970 have
increased by almost 70 percent of course
it's the newer more capable models that
have suffered the highest price
inflation but even so we're seeing about
a 15% increase for the older mid-range
models as well and pricing had already
started to increase by September moving
over to the radio and GPUs we have 24
models but please note I haven't
included factory overclocked options
like the 79 78 gigahertz edition or the
7950 boost those versions have just been
included
with these standard models again here's
a look back at pricing in September of
2017 as you can see AMD graphics cards
have increased in demand significantly
with most having increased by 60% or
more in price over the past six months
it's shocking to see the ultra
entry-level models such as the r7 360
increasing by almost 90 percent in value
that's pretty insane really but even
with all this pricing information sorted
out you might now have a good idea of
what each of these models is roughly
worth but you probably still have little
idea about which one you should actually
buy so there let's talk performance
here's how the GeForce GPU stack up when
benchmarked in three modern games using
medium quality settings
Tandy P also please don't I've included
the GT 1030 GTX 1050 and GTX 1066
gigabyte so you can see how the older
second-hand graphics cards stack up to
these modern entry-level and mid-range
offerings as you can see the GTX 980 is
comparable to the GTX 1066 gigabyte the
gtx 960 and 760 are comparable to the
gtx 1050 while the GTX 650 Ti is
comparable to the GT 1030 for those
wondering I am using the 384 CUDA core
version of the GTX 560 Ti and for
whatever reason it just stinks it's way
worse than the GTX 570 and I have tried
two different models and I've got the
same results so yeah it just hasn't held
up well over time so I'd scrub the base
model gtx 560 TI and 560 of your list
most of these graphics cards though did
provide playable performance though be
aware models with less than 2 gigabytes
of vram can and will deliver mixed
results in modern titles here's a quick
look at the price versus performance for
the GeForce GPUs I won't focus on this
graph for too long as I do have a proper
cost per frame analysis coming up in a
moment at a glance though the GTX 670
and 760 look very good moving on to the
Radeon GPUs we see fairly respectable
performance across the board with the
exception of the Radeon HD 7770 and 77
90 the r7 360 was also a bit of a
battler and the r7 to see
DX will struggle in some titles
requiring lower quality settings and
perhaps even a lower resolution here we
can see that the RX 580 sits between the
r9 390x and r9 nano while the RX 560 is
comparable to the HD 7870 and r9 270x
then the rx 550 can be found sitting
between the HD 77 90 and r7 360 then
finally before moving on here is a quick
look at the price versus performance the
r9 290 looks good along with the 285 and
HD 7970 okay so here is the cost per
frame analysis for the GeForce GPUs and
as you can see the gtx 570 offers the
most bang for your buck at the current
prices the GTX 670 760 and 660ti also
offer exceptional value for me a
standard here though was the gtx 770 as
it was very capable and all of the aims
tested but it also comes in at a cost of
just a dollar 53 per frame as expected
the AMD cards are a little more pricey
in today's market and getting anything
good for less than a dollar fifty per
frame isn't really possible
realistically for a good gaming card
you'll be paying over a dollar eighty
per frame for anything from AMD still
when compared to buying new these older
graphics cards such as the 290 X and 290
for example are much better value ok so
throughout this video I've had a really
really tough time showing you all the
data for all 44 GPUs on a single screen
at once it's not really possible without
scrolling which gets even more confusing
so here all the graphics cards that can
be regularly had for a cost of less than
$2 50 per frame based on our testing
this leaves us with 33 GPUs but we can
scrub off an additional three as the
seventy seven seventy seventy seven
ninety and 652 are all too slow to be
useful in my opinion okay so this then
is what we've been working towards a
list of the best bang for your buck AMD
Nvidia graphics cards available on the
second-hand market again the GTX 570 and
670 are standouts here and well the r7
260x looks decent it's actually very
slow most of the GPUs in this list
though are quite capable
but what if you want something that
maintained over 60fps in our three-game
average well here you go
these are the best value performance
graphics cards capable of delivering
respectable performance in all the
latest titles at 1080p the GTX 770
stands out as the best value choice
while the GTX 680 offers a decent bang
for your buck as well the GTX 780 does
surprisingly well also the r9 285 looks
to be a great choice from AMD but be
aware these results are somewhat skewed
by availability for example in the last
six months there have been just 2409 285
graphics cards solid option while in the
same period 600 gtx 770 cards were sold
over 200 GTX 680 and 200 HD 7970 models
were also sold so realistically you have
a much better chance of getting a 79 70
at a reasonable price compared to the 79
78 the r9 280x
actually appears to be better value and
with over 400 of them selling in the
last six months you have an even better
chance of getting your hands on one of
those the GTX 780 Ti looks to be a good
option as well I feel like drivers
support has improved for the capital
architecture in recent time but I could
be wrong about that I haven't really
looked into it properly either way it
did very well in the three games
selected for this test and as such it
came in at a cost of just a dollar
ninety-nine per frame which isn't that
bad really
that said though with just a hundred and
fifty of them sold in the last six
months getting one might be a little
more difficult it might cost two hundred
and forty dollars us on average but the
GTX 970 should be a pretty easy graphics
card to get your hands on as almost 2000
of them have sold at auction in the last
six months as one of envy is best
selling GPUs of all time it's really not
that surprising to find so many of them
for sale on the second-hand market it's
well worth noting though that in terms
of value the GTX 1050 is very similar to
the GTX 970 and 980 both of the 900
series GPUs are of course quite a good
bit faster so they will enable higher
quality visuals for those of you
wondering here's a quick look at the
average option price in March for each
model as you can see the cheapest
options include the GTX 770 and GTX 680
while the uh 9 to 85
r9 280x and 7970 worked much more
expensive coming in at around the same
price as a gtx 1050 that said though the
gtx 1050 technically shouldn't be
included here as it fell short of the 60
FPS minimum with an average 1% lower
result of 54 frames per second here we
see that the gtx 770 and 680 offer
considerably better performance as does
the 79 72 ATX and 285 so there you have
it a full breakdown of the used graphics
card market it should be noted that this
guide is accurate based on auction
prices in March of 2018 or at least the
options we've seen so far and as always
pricing will likely change over the
coming weeks and months whether that is
for better or for worse is yet to be
seen but for those of you buying right
now this video should give you a very
good idea of what you should be looking
out for for those of you in different
regions with a different pricing
structure the benchmark results
including this video will still prove
invaluable for working out which
graphics cards are worth investing in
and how much you should spend as I found
in my recent gtx 680 and r9 280x revisit
videos you will really need to do better
than the average selling price to really
justify buying a used graphics card for
example at the average selling price the
GTX 980 is just 20% cheaper in terms of
cost per frame than a brand new gtx 1060
and while that means you stand to save
about $70 u.s. that's really not enough
to justify the gamble with older used
Hardware of course you can get lucky the
cheapest gtx 980 sold an option this
month went for just 225 dollars and
that's a massive saving from the 360
dollars you expect to pay for a GTX 1060
and almost 40% discount in fact
personally I always shoot for at least a
40% saving on second-hand hardware when
compared to a brand new equivalent
second-hand shopping for a Radeon
graphics card does look to be a bit less
cost-effective the r9 390x for example
is just 16 percent cheaper than the rx
580 when comparing the cost per frame
so although the 390x is on average $100
cheaper
ideally it really needs to be $200
cheaper to make sense in my opinion at
$270 that would give you an almost 40%
saving over
a new graphics card given the auction
prices that I've seen though over the
last few months getting one for that
price really won't be easy I only found
a single example of a working cart that
went for as low as $270 most cheap
models have gone for a little over three
hundred dollars which admittedly is
still quite good overall though the star
of this roundup was the gtx 770 along
with the recently revisited gtx 680 the
gtx 780 also put in a surprisingly good
showing so that's an option worth
considering as well based purely on the
average option sale prices there really
isn't much to see from AMD it seems
their cards are just too good at mining
but with the cryptocurrency industry
seemingly falling apart at the moment
the future could be bright once again
for gamers
fingers crossed anyway and that's where
I'm going to end this video I really
hope you found it useful I poured a huge
amount of time and effort into this one
