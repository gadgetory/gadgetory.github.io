I'm your host Matt and today we'll be
taking a look at Intel's new core i3
6100 budget skylake processor already
three months has passed since Intel
releases later CPU microarchitecture
codename skylake leading the charge was
the core i7 6700 K costing 370 dollars
and the more affordable Core i5 6600 K
at 270 since then Intel has quietly
released a few locked core i7 and Core
i5 skylake processors the cheapest of
which is the core i5 6400 at the cost of
$190 so those of you keen to run intel's
most efficient architecture today but
can't afford to drop $200 on the cpu the
upcoming core i3 and pentium range is
likely of greater interest in stark
contrast to the previous skylake launch
Intel isn't going to make a big deal out
of these more affordable parts rather
they'll just slowly appear on the market
so far Intel's announced three standard
power desktop core i3 parts which
include the 6160 360 320 the core i3
6100 is as expected the cheapest of the
three with an MSRP of 117 dollars the
6300 features of $139 MSRP and there
6320 with a $148 MSRP each of these
processors are separated by a 100
megahertz frequency with the 6100
starting at a rather high 3.7 gigahertz
clock speed as seen previously the core
i3 range doesn't support turbo boost
although it does come with hyper
threading enabled for a total of 4
threads other than the minor change in
frequency the only other difference is
the l3 cache size which has been reduced
to 3 megabytes for the 6100 while the 60
263 twins you both get a larger 4
megabyte cache they each come with the
Intel HD graphics 530 working it between
350 and 1150 megahertz and a Raider for
51 Watts TDP like the Core i5 and core
i7 skylake processors these core i3
models use the LGA 1151 socket
depending on the motherboard can support
either ddr3 or ddr4 memory specs I'd the
core Oh 361 hundreds very similar to the
house well based core i3 4170 both
operate at 3.7 gigahertz and feature
three megabyte l3 cache they are of
course both dual core parts aided by
hyper threading looking to AMD's line up
the core i3 6100 will be competing with
the FX 6300 or the a-10 7700 k though
unhampered testing we have the faster FX
8350 that being said let's move on to
check out the benchmark results the core
i3 6100 provided a minor performance
bump over the house walk or a 340 360 in
the Cinebench r15 synthetic benchmarks
multi-threaded cpu test the single
thread test again shows that the new
skylake core i3 6100 isn't a great deal
faster than the 40 360 it's going just a
few extra points again we find only a
minor improvement for the 6100 when
compared to the 40 360 this time when
benchmarking web export 2015 almost no
improvement was seen in Excel 2013 as
the 6100 manages to shave just 0.1
seconds off the completion time around
100 points was gained in the 7-zip
benchmark that equated to just a mere 1%
improvement and 11 percent improvement
is seen in Photoshop CC making the 6100
a good bit faster than the 40 360 and
this is the first time we've seen a
noteworthy improvement
rounding out the application testing the
core i3 6100 delivered a 7% performance
improvement over the 40 360 when
encoding with handbrake the 6100
features the same HD graphics 530 engine
as the desktop skylake core i5 and core
i7 processors that being the case it
isn't surprising that we find the 6100
delivering similar performance to that
of the 6600 K and 6700 K making it quite
a bit faster than the 40 360 but
ultimately much slower than the a-10
7870 K hitman absolution is a game that
demands strong CPU performance and this
is likely why we're seeing the core i3
6143 frames per second behind the faster
Core i5 and core i7 processors with just
35 frames per second the 6100 offered a
decent performance increase over the 40
360 and was just three frames per second
slower than the core
566 hundred K moreover it was just five
frames slower than the AMD a10 78 70 K
installing a mid-range discrete graphics
card such as the geforce gtx 960 showed
that the core i3 6100 can hang with his
bigger brothers in BioShock Infinite and
push the 960 to an impressive 111 frames
per second at 1080 P in hitman
absolution the i3 6100 was just a single
frame faster than the AI 340 360 and
just a single frame slower than the i5
6600 K finally we have Metro Redux which
makes good use of the CPU as well as the
GPU and here we're seeing a rather large
performance advantage in favor of the
Toro 360 100 over the AMD FX 8350 still
when compared to the AI 340 360 the i3
6100 was just a single frame faster
interestingly the core i3 6100 consumed
just 3 watts less than the AI 340 360
there was such a slim margin it's quite
possible the difference in motherboards
used for testing could sway the results
one way or the other the i7 6700 K
didn't consume a great deal less power
than the i7 4790k but the margin was
more impressive than what we're seeing
here between the skylake and Haswell
core i3 processors before wrapping up
this review I just like to point out
that the core i3 is 6100 was tested with
ddr4 2666 memory using a Zed 170
motherboard the same setup was used for
the 6600 K and 6700 K that said those
looking to pair the core i3 6100 with a
cheaper motherboard using either the H
170 H 110 or be 150 chipset will be
limited to the 20 133 megahertz memory
speed or lower we did run a few
application gaming tests using the 20
133 megahertz memory and the performance
was much the same as our 26 66 megahertz
configuration
likewise ddr4 3,200 memory was also
tested and again we didn't see much of
an advantage to using this high speed
memory the i3 4360 was tested using ddr3
2133 memory as with the AMD processors
performance wise the skylight core i3
processors and nothing to write home
about for the most part we only saw very
minor performance gains within the brow
with a few percent price-wise consumers
will pay a very small premium as a
similar core i3 has well billed to cost
only around 10% less still that only
works out to be something like a $20
saving so for those looking at a
complete system upgrade we recommend
building with skylake rather than as
well as the upgrade path will justify
the small price premium if you're
already working with a house web-based
system then the upgrade to skylake makes
little to no sense in fact you would
have to be using an Intel system that
predates the four-year-old Sandy Bridge
architecture to justify upgrading to
skylight in my opinion those using older
AMD hardware on the am-3 platform for
example certainly have the ways to gain
by upgrading to a skylake system when
compared to AMD's flagship FX 8350 and
FX 95 90 we're finding the core i3 6100
provides a decent upgrade particularly
in the latest game such as fallout 4 in
call of duty black ops 3 in fact even
the new DirectX 12 title ashes of the
singularity we found the core i3 6100 to
be a superior solution overall the i3
6100 certainly a very capable processor
and in most cases gamers will struggle
to distinguish between it and the much
more expensive core i5 6600 K in fact we
don't recommend gamers bother investing
in a Core i5 processor unless they plan
to spend in excess of $300 on their
graphics card
