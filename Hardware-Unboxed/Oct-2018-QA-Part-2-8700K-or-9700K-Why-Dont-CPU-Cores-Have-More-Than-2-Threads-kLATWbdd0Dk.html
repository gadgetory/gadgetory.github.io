this is part two of the October 2018 Q&amp;amp;A
I think part one was on the channel
probably a few days before now but we've
got a whole other selection of questions
for this particular video so yes still
some interesting things to get to so I
guess we'll get to some more questions I
want to do it ok next question and I'm
gonna get you to us address this one
because this is very interesting quite
ok I have some thoughts on it why don't
we have more than two threads per core
and then is it even possible yeah we
were talking about this just before head
start Lisa Kuhne eggs whether these are
the top upvoted question on you Gerry
but so the way what hyper threading in
SMT is designed to do the
multi-threading type thing is just to
you better utilize the CPU resources in
the actual physical core that's there so
around
yeah no waiting around you're cutting
out you know that sort of time just you
know every single time there's something
ready to go it's gone it's done it's
done so having those two threads go into
the one physical core helps that out so
when you sort of thinking about running
more threads where where you gain the
advantage from where the physical core
is still the same so is it utilizing
that core even more or you're just gonna
get bottlenecked by just having more
things ready to go in line so yeah I
don't think is it possible I'm sure it's
possible from a design standpoint to do
it I just don't think that there's much
of a reason to do it we're already sort
of utilizing most of the resources there
with existing hyper threading yeah well
you have to dedicate part of the die
area to making another pipe to the CPU
and if that pipe is only gaining you a
couple of percent more performance it's
not worth the percentage it took yeah
created so what's the whole percentage
you get say hyper threading versus the
non yeah I would guess around 25% Yost
in efficiency yeah all that core and
adding a third one if it was to even
provide an advantage and not go
backwards would be only a couple of
percent I imagine
because if ya having just the extra pipe
there would do that
so hyper-threading I'm trying I'm just I
haven't thought this through like for a
quick analogy but it's kind of like if
Tim's the core and he's doing work and
I'm handing him paperwork to do and then
I've got to go get the next bit of paper
and Tim sitting there going out where's
this next bit of paper and there's a few
second delay if there's a second person
they're giving him the second bit of
paper
Tim's always got paper to work on and
then it's like just Tim benefit for
having a third person if he's only
getting a small benefit from the second
person's only just helping here and
there adding a third person doesn't
really help it just means as a third
person staying up a bit of paper more
often yeah potentially makes it more
complex it's more complex and then it
might be that if there's another Tim
another core then that ends up having to
go back to you much thrown away and then
reissued and it's just creates a whole
mess yeah I guess with these sort of
things you know you have to think it
seems like a fairly obvious thing that a
designer could do is add an extra thread
to get more performance but the fact
that neither AMD nor Intel has shown any
inclination of going to three threads
should true sort of tell you that it's
probably not right now going to give you
that sort of performance advantage yeah
I think the fact that an extra pipe
doesn't boost performance by a hundred
percent it's probably the reason why
there's not a third one I think that's
more the simplest way of going about
that one okay another question from our
discord chat from Nick's certain
hardware room is that easy to tell a
mile off of that fake others seem
reasonable and maybe true but sometimes
turn out not to be true
how have you to determine in the past
what is actually real and what's not
I'm thinking like in scenarios where you
guys have been spot on but many others
have been taken in by what seemed to be
a believable rumour oh yeah it is that I
was just going to interrupt that it's a
bit of a joke for the patreon members
DirectX 13 is a bit of people yeah yeah
that's a lot of stuff I mean I guess
sometimes we do sort of get information
that's not made public which makes it a
bit easier sort of figure out what's
going on especially if there's like an
upcoming product launch and you know we
haven't been to let's say products
coming out like a couple of weeks and we
haven't heard about it pretty unlikely
that whatever that product was being
rumored is
a legit product at that point yeah
especially if they're getting into
detailed specifications and performance
and then it's usually yeah not true but
along the time yeah it's pretty hard to
tell but it's just I guess yet so I
common sense like this might be a little
tell in it that's you know doesn't seem
right like you know then take a GPU for
example it might have a a reasonable
sounding TDP a and core count but then
the clock speeds are like much higher
than we know that process technology to
be able to do so this stuff like that I
think you nailed it with the start the
RT x-series is a perfect example we
heard some things that were later
released and we're not gonna say oh we
knew that because people like are you
sure you did kiss some weak we don't do
rumors and we just wait for the official
stuff because we're more focused on
showing you results that we're not a
news channel and we you do your roundup
once a week but that that's all we
really want to do that's what we really
want to do so that's as much news as Tim
can handle in a week but the RT X launch
is a perfect example it was seeing leaks
for months since the start of the year
yes it was coming next month it's coming
next month and there was all these
details and Tim and I said well we've
heard of no event yes we've heard
nothing and then the way it did go down
was we were invited to an event in the
US
more than a month before I was gonna hit
shelves so we would have known five six
weeks you know while we were invited to
that event weeks in advance yeah yeah so
it was almost it was at least six weeks
we knew when it was happening and then
it was a month after when we thought it
was going to be happening again so it
was even longer than that yeah yeah so
anyway it the way it works we have a
pretty good idea of what's happening
when so we we know are some events that
are happening now that is scheduled for
AMD um and you can't say much more than
that but we sort of know what it's
possibly coming and when yeah it's
basically had happens all right Steve if
you were buying a new PC primarily for
gaming is there any reason to get a 9700
K or 9900 K but given the price of this
one I think it's definitely a no anyhow
over an 8700 K to be future proofed for
the next three or five years so is there
any reason to get a 9700 K
over an 8700 K the next three to five
years well based on the preliminary
testing we did for our day one coverage
I would say no the way it works is with
the hyper threading in terms of CPU
resources you could argue that the 8700
K would act what is it like a nine core
yeah yes Bob I mean yeah it's a it's a
rough at worst case you would say they'd
be similar it's kind of like you've got
your quad cores like your 7700 KS 6700k
with hyper-threading and they still
stack up really well today so I don't
think there'll be in five years when
both CPUs are maxed out I don't think
you'll see any difference between the
differences that you see today the 9700
caves generally faster because clocked
higher and not having hyper-threading
can be beneficial for some games I don't
think it's worth yeah I don't know it's
a tough one that a higher price at the
moment it's yeah I mean it's only I
think it's only about 40 or $50 more for
the 9700 K yeah the 1900 K is well other
question because that makes no sense in
terms of value
yeah it really comes down to price if
you could get the 9700 K for the same
price as the 87 or okay then maybe yeah
it's a tough one
it's really you yeah it's hard to say
the 97 RK is a few advantages the
soldered chip means that it should run a
bit cooler but yeah like you can get
with a similar price then sure get the
nice Allegra K but otherwise it's kind
of a pointless CPU at least that's how
it seems right now okay another good
question from Nick here for games right
now and for the near future is there any
reason to go beyond eight cores like our
current highest and mainstream CPUs from
AMD and Intel obviously if you're a
content creator the more coarse the
better but as a gamer first I'm not
trying to be necessarily benefiting from
a theoretical 12 core Zen 2 CPU yeah
that's a fair assumption yeah we've done
a lot of a 6 core verse 8 corner both of
the CPUs at SMT technology so that's
either
AMD's SMT implementation or hyper
threading for
tell so if it has SMT six core processor
perfectly fine as I said in an earlier
question even your quad cores with an
SMT technology is fine not a problem we
haven't seen much difference between the
six and eight Saints are starting to
pull away a little bit now because eight
logical cores are starting to get
utilized quite well on the latest and
greatest games but from eight to twelve
for gaming it's gonna be many years
before yeah and again I think we
mentioned this a few times with these
sort of theoretical what's happening in
the future type questions a lot of
what's needed for game is really
dictated by the game consoles your ps4
in your xbox so right now we're those
consoles have such limited CPU power you
know it's not necessarily going to be
required to have even more cause whereas
theoretically let's say yes maybe a PS 5
would have a 12 courses in two CPU then
you'll get that leap when developers are
suddenly utilized well CPU resource
that's true it'll you'll get the leap
where it scales across all the core as
well but then if you have a quad core
that's clocked twice as high it's still
going to work ok especially if you have
half as many cause a 6 core for example
if the 6 cores clocked twice as
aggressively as the 12 core on the
console that will work just fine so it
it's still about the frequency megahertz
still matter
okay another discord question will
thermals of a CPU kill a motherboard
faster I believe a downdraft ITX school
will hotbox an ITX system so ok yes and
no I suppose it's a tough one too it
depends how hot the CPU is because
obviously on an especially mini ITX
board an example you give having any Oh
airflow is beneficial generally a
leaking so I would say yeah it's a bit
of a yes or no situation it depends I
think it's probably no for the most part
yeah what would the crews having to go
what would probably be more of a problem
there is just the components themselves
so or the CPU itself self the CPUs
drawing a lot of
and that's stretching the components and
that's making them work near maximum
capacity which is well above their
optimal efficiency level that's probably
gonna kill the motherboard fast and I
think yeah definitely
okay so this is one is for you I reckon
for me how much of a performance boost
can we expect from ddr5 in gaming and
content creation uh I will preface this
by saying we're expecting about 80%
higher bandwidth yeah looking at does
yeah well that
keeping that in mind that doesn't
actually change my answer yeah there's
always a bit of an expectation when you
memory technologies come in that they're
just going to well huge step forward and
it's a lot better it's certainly gonna
help if you were to put ddr5 memory on a
coffee like CPU like your 8700 k the
performance benefit will be virtually
zero so we've seen this before in the
past slot when going from ddr2 ddr3 and
ddr4 ddr4 the initial step on the
existing platforms is pretty much the
same for a couple of reasons
first of all so if you're getting 80%
bandwidth boost right off the bat
that's good that's more than what we've
seen in the past because in the past
it's been pretty much parity you started
where the and it was just carried on
from existing points yeah
it's supposed to have better bandwidth
at the same speeds that's that's
exceptional but in any case that will
only provide a performance benefit with
current processors assuming that they
could support ddr5 which there's no
evidence they can but if they could
you're not going to see a performance
uplift because they're not memory
bandwidth limited because you can get
ddr4 4000 and something and the
performance uplift in most new things is
like that it's not huge I mean it can
scale quite well on some stuff but for
future processors that are designed to
take advantage of more bandwidth with
more cores and faster cause and things
like that then it will just it'll enable
the newer CPUs to take that step forward
which they couldn't necessarily do with
the slower memory technology much like
what G DDR 6 has done for the RT X cards
they've been out well in that sense
they've just sacrificed the
the memory bus yeah because they've been
out of compensate with faster memory but
I'm interested see what it offers but I
wouldn't expect any huge leap enable
just because of the memory it'll be what
the memory enables the newer platforms
to do okay this question it will be
interesting for Australian viewers and
those of you are international viewers
who are interested in the Australian
market anyway I'll get to the question
why our Australian PC parts so inflated
especially for graphics cards and CPUs
I understand conversion rates but like
God Tim and rgx 20 80 and 87 Rek is
literally 2k so yeah basically in
Australia what are you saying there is
what it works out to be in US dollars
you're straight conversion and there's a
significant percentage increase over
that for us Ozzy shoppers for a lot of
things they call it Australia tax
similar to the I suppose Apple tax yeah
you're I guess Europe also faces a
similar issue so yeah we did speak to
one of these sort of retailers that gave
us a bit of an insight into this and I
guess one of the things that that they
mentioned was that America and Australia
have different distribution networks so
here a lot of things are done through
distributors whereas in the u.s. it
might be done directly with the vendor
which of course you add in a distributor
they have to take a cut so that
increases the end pricing so they're
cutting the middleman is if you other
things some people doing the direct
conversion don't factor in our added
sales tax I've seen that's a fairly
common mistake to make on top of that we
have different consumer law here
different warranties so often the
overheads for supporting those different
things can increase the cost cost of
doing business I think as well one of
the big things that people sort of or
companies adding is just the willingness
to buy or the your purchasing power sort
of factor which I guess companies figure
that Australians have more purchasing
power they're more disposable income or
something so they figure that you know
we are more willing to spend more than
the direct conversion so because we're
more willing to spend more they can
price it higher and we very often say
that with games let's go so what happens
with games you'll you'll see a lot of
the game sites that sell keys across
multiple you'll see so like Russia I
think as well it's often very cheap
compared to Australia yes they have a
lot lower willingness to buy and so yeah
obviously that's exactly the same
product that cost them literally the
same for distributions that's one of the
one of those things where you see that
purchasing power argument come into play
yeah it's very dodgy but that's just how
the world works yeah basically this
retail is also saying that you know if
they're working directly with the brand
it's pretty easy for them to match us
regular retail price plus GST to
Australian dollars so yeah it does
depend I think it there's a a final
issue that we're sourcing a little bit
is when we gain the sort of stock
related issues like Intel struggling to
produce ninety nine hundred case or
companies struggling to produce enough
chips that they tend to prioritize the
u.s. is our market yeah so we got the
scraps yeah here we get some issues with
you know ninety nine hundred case being
even less available than they on the US
which pushes prices higher so yeah we
get so many issues pretty much yeah
supply and demand hits us a bit harder
yeah alright next question is 4k
resolution worth it by 27-inch screen as
high frame rate or high resolution at
the most important for casual gamer in
my opinion it really depends on the
gamer and the game you're playing 4k at
27 inch is the minimum I would go I've
got a 4k 27-inch screen for testing and
it's noticeably better than the 1440p
version I have if you're looking just
for sharpness and all that so you can
definitely see the difference in my
opinion but personally I would prefer
the 1440p screen for the higher frame
rates if I'm playing FPS games and stuff
like that but anyway this is sort of a
Tim yeah I think you know it's it's nice
to tend to play different games and
mushrooms but I do play a lot of your
sort of role-playing games an
action-adventure games where the high
frame rate isn't as important for your
competitive advantage and I still find
that you know if my choice is between
running at 4k at a lower frame rate or
1440p at a high frame rate I will always
choose 1440p at a higher frame rate
because the quality increase especially
in get like things where there's no text
or you don't mean that
you don't really need that super fine
detail it's gonna be more your
you know can I run it an ultra compared
to high or can I run it at a higher
framerate those things give a much
bigger improvement to the experience and
the quality of the game as opposed to
just switching from 40 42 4k but if you
were telling me which one would I prefer
for reading a book or something reading
websites you know the Christmas of text
at 4k is like massive I think you've
said it in the past and I agree that
1440p especially for 27-inch screen is
the sweet spot because the on a on a
27-inch screen the difference between
1080p and 1440p for game is massive yeah
massive here's a lot sharper yeah why
are you different whereas from 1440p to
4k it's like it's it's in my opinion you
can definitely tell the difference but
it's like okay yeah that's bad that's a
bit sharper yeah it's a bit nice no ice
up but yeah from 1080p to 1440p it's
like whoa yeah this is a totally
different ballgame and then if you're
talking about like 60 FPS versus a
hundred FPS or even worse like 30 versus
like 60 then you know it's gonna be um
not like way bigger difference than just
the resolution just so yeah comes out of
personal preference and the games you're
playing I think it's probably that
simple all right next question the
latest I $9.99 hundred K flagship CPU
seems to be pushing the boundaries of
thermals with even minor overclocks from
a pure performance standpoint does Intel
have any meaningful way to release a
superior non HD DT chip before the 10
nanometer transition no no they don't no
they don't they're in a really really
tough position that at this point I have
to get 10 nanometre out to go further
they have to they're stuck so the night
under a really is pushing - and arguably
beyond boundaries which is why we're
seeing all these problems with
motherboards and cooling and whatnot
yeah there's the it's really why Intel
has been such a mess this year we're
used to seeing Intel released stuff it's
done it all goes fairly well and then
we've we've seen the well kb lake was
acted very quickly wasn't it yep coffee
like came out of nowhere offered six
cores to compete with rise and so he got
that and then that started off
and then they realized they had to gain
8-core on that platform and a lot of the
boards wouldn't support that kind of
power delivery so they released these at
390 chipset to signify that the Zen 390
boards can support they're ready for the
eight cores they're intended for the
eight cores and they will work and we
still have this huge issue with some
boards limiting power because they don't
want to kill themselves over a
relatively short period of time so yeah
the answer's no really yep even for the
high-end desktop platforms where they're
not going anywhere with that either yeah
I don't think so
so we're gonna be stuck on on both
fronts so yeah they need two nanometer
to come mmm
next year could be pretty brutal for
Intel if she wasn't already they've had
the year from how the security stuff
alone was brutal for them but yeah it's
been rough for Intel yeah it's been a
really rough year I don't I think
they've ever seen you like this before
in the company's history mm-hmm I mean
they're still selling CPUs quite well
probably not towards the end of the year
but they were earlier on yeah next
year's gonna be very interesting that is
for sure
okay we'll aim D ever catch up to Intel
in instructions per clock often referred
to as IPC a single core so that's sort
of the same thing all they always play
second fiddle cause with upcoming 7
nanometre cpu they have a lot of
headroom I double that of and then I
have I can double that of Intel okay I
had a little my little weird doctorate
yeah walk it off yeah so that butchered
the end of my mic wish or reading the
question out there I mean will they
catch up to the instructions per clock I
mean that's on the architecture design
team it they're just not gonna make much
of a difference with seven nanometer
because they'll just be allowing to
clock higher and well more yes no so
well the IPC really relies on a lot of
things yeah people see anything that's
just to do with it's the call so it's
the sitting around the core as well you
say IPC changes dramatically when you
tighten up memory timings with Rison and
the latency improvements that they made
with second gen Rison certainly
attributed to improved IPC yeah so if
the next gen goes to what we're talking
about before ddr5 and that makes huge
bandwidth improvements
possibly latency timing improvements and
all that stuff together and they may
very well overtake and they're not that
far be if you if you chew up the memory
now for both platforms AMD and Intel and
obviously compare them at the same core
count and clock speed for productivity
Intel has like we're talking very low
single-digit percentage game gaming
that's very latency sensitive it comes
up to like 10 percent so you sort of get
into low double digits yeah yeah so I
mean 7 nanometre will give Andy an
advantage in that they won't be as
limited by a clock speed anymore
relative to Intel that's the big one
this they're behind on IPC and clock
speed at the moment so I mean you get
the dog way and that's why they've gone
with more cause when they move to seven
enemy that they'll be able to hopefully
and it seems like all the things that
TMC are saying suggests they will be
able to push up those frequencies closer
to what Intel is already achieving with
Intel's own 14 nanometer and then yeah
as you were saying it's kind of the rest
of the stuff that needs to go into them
improving IPC so that's not necessarily
as related to 7 nanometre tech so what
they're doing AVX instructions in
particular can they improve their
efficiency there will help them out with
some productivity were close again well
I think latency yeah all that sort of
stuff will be helped by the node shrink
as well yeah because they can dedicate a
bit more resources to fattening those
things up but we'll see before till I
mean we're not claiming anything who
knows could could be terrible could be
amazing could be anything but we're
expecting we are expecting pretty good
things all right I'll read this one out
because I have no idea what I'm having
to answer it most anticipated PC games
for 2019 and we thought about 2019 I'm
still trying to get through all the day
1 reviews of this month let alone we've
got a few games to come that fall out
yeah yeah fill that there's like hit man
and just cause I think towards the later
end of the year battlefield 5 as well a
lot of 50 GPU benchmarks for me have fun
that's between nineteen oh what do you
reckon I mean metros out next year
yeah that's where the main one because I
really enjoyed not just because of the
new technology that probably but the
probably name itself probably won't be
in the game when it comes out let's be
honest yeah if we haven't got
ray-tracing sorted out by then yeah I
mean a lot of stuff doesn't get
announced until the year of these days
that's right it's hard to know I mean
I'm not as bullish on anthem
oh no that's like a big game people are
really mixture as well I think maybe
they push that to the end of next year
but so I'm not it was early certainly
Nick I think was holiday I'm not quite
beyond that but I'm certainly not as
excited about that it seems more in line
with destiny which is a game I didn't
really get into all that much so and you
know EAS games tend to be a little
disappointing lately when they've been
released so yeah I mean again it's hard
to know without a full slate of what's
to come
but certainly Metro for sure and then PC
game we've got to the point now where
will you take it on a per game basis as
it's released and you get to check it
out yeah pretty much cuz yeah getting
hopped up and excited for a game is no
longer a good strategy yeah yeah we'll
just check the games out as they come
next year benchmark the hell out of them
and Tim will do some optimizations and
give you his impression of the game okay
this is a question that I see come up
sometime so I've included in here so
this person asks hi being a fan of
Witcher 3 does r-tx cards improve or
enhance the visual quality in this title
especially during sunset and samurai
scenes so simple as there is no buying a
new CPU or GPU architecture switching
from AMD to in video anything like that
has no impact on the visual quality the
qualities things are just set in the
game you can either run them or you
can't running a new GPU doesn't give you
doesn't unlock like a new tier of
quality it still does it still looks the
same
yeah that is assuming you not coming
from a card that couldn't run about
Ultra dog yeah that's the only reason
why you might say so yeah I suppose
that's the confusion with that question
so people get excited for a new GP to go
back and play an older game because now
they can play it at a higher quality
setting higher resolution so it's nicer
and sharper and all that but for example
Ultra on Pascal Cotte an ultra on a
cheering card of both going to look
exactly
keep the same yeah as I mean running at
a high frame rate in my opinion does
deliver better visual coid smoother it's
nicer to play and it just looks clearer
and sharper when you're playing at a
higher framerate but aside from that
visual visual fidelity the effects and
everything is the same all right so that
is all the questions that we've done for
October in 2018 it seems like really did
the september 1 like just last week but
guess it's more actually a whole month
in the end yeah it was late last yeah I
lose track I think it's just been really
busy
yeah it's cuz of all launches the RTX
2070 the core I nine thread Ripper
actually that's still coming up through
the 12 and 24 core yeah so pretty crazy
lots of lots of stuff so yeah we keeping
ourselves busy so hopefully you guys
have all subscribe to catch all that
content but if you haven't definitely do
that and yeah give this video a thumbs
up if you liked it and I guess we'll see
you in the very next one
