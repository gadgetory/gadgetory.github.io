between testing all the current game
releases the RT X updates all that sort
of thing I've managed to finish testing
the gigabyte arrow 15 X 9 the first
Nvidia RT X laptop we got sent it's a
pretty cool product it's also quite
similar to the area 15 X v8 we looked at
last year with a few upgrades that will
walk you through in this video in terms
of hardware a lot of what we're seeing
here has carried over from the previous
generation the CPU is still Intel's Core
i7
8750 H for most models with an i-9 8950
HK option available the display is
either a 144 Hertz 1080p IPS or a wide
gamut 4k IPS at 60 Hertz and of course
it's 15.6 inches in size memory ranges
from 8 gigabytes up to 32 gig depending
on the configuration though 16 gig
models come with single channel memory
the battery as well still 94 watt hours
in what appears to be the same chassis
so what are the changes the big one is
the upgrade from an nvidia geforce gtx
1070 max q2 the new r-tx 2070 max-q
which we covered previously in a
separate video
we're also seeing a switch from Toshiba
nvme PCIe SSD s2 Intel SSDs which in
combination with killer networking that
uses Intel chips allows gigabyte to
claim this laptop as the world's only
all Intel Inside notebook there are a
few upgrades on the software side as
well there's a new gigabyte command
center application plus some unique AI
functionality powered by Microsoft's
Azur AI cloud services also worth
pointing out there's an error of 15y 9
model bumps you up to an RT x 28 Emacs q
GP with otherwise the same hardware and
just so you know pricing before the end
the regular model with the 27 t max q
144 hertz 1080p display 16 gigabytes of
ram and one terabyte SSD is 2400 US
dollars in australia you're looking at
3,700 bucks
however I personally reviewed the
mid-tier X 9 which features the 4k
display and 32 gig of ram which bumps up
the price to 2700 US dollars gigabyte
has been using a similar design for the
past couple of generations and I think
it largely still holds up today
this design was one of the first to use
slim bezels around the display now
that's a much more common feature but it
still looks pretty good here
the downside is still the webcam
placement which sits below the screen
providing a look straight up your
nostrils newer slim bezel design seems
to fix the problem either through a
small increase in the top bezel or
including a camera bump hopefully
gigabyte goes with this approach next
time though post is I almost never use
the webcast not really a big deal for me
the laptop is solidly built using a
combination of metal and plastic there's
not a lot of gamer Flair which is nice
it makes it suitable for uses both a
gaming laptop or a workstation and I
always prefer more minimalist
professional styles there is still a few
scenes around the place that make it
look less sleek than something like a
razor blade or msi gs70 sign well not
bad by any means is more of a functional
build than one design for pure
aesthetics and this is also reflected in
the size and weight 18.9 millimeters
thick and 2 kilograms heavy puts it in
the slim and light gaming notebook
category but it's not challenging for
any records those who want something
that's not chunky will be pretty happy
with your a 15 X although tricky laptops
tend to be a lot cheaper for the
hardware you get portability does always
come at a price io is very good as you'd
expect to USB C ports one is Thunderbolt
3 type see the other USB 3.1 there's a
further 3 USB 3.1 type a ports 2 gen 1
and one Gen 2 and then you get Ethernet
HDMI 2.0 a 3.5 you do Jack and an SD
card reader so there's no need for
dongles with this machine it basically
has everything you'd want the keyboard
still has a nice reasonably clicky
tactile response with perky RGB
backlighting control through gigabytes
fusion software I also really
appreciated the numpad
although the truncated right shift to
fit in the arrow keys is a bit annoying
I'm also very happy to report the crappy
eel and trackpad used in previous models
has been ditched for a better more
responsive high precision moral it's a
pretty big upgrade in terms of
performance there's no one to say in
interview that I haven't covered
previously for productivity the crow
78758 with 32 gigabytes of RAM performs
exactly as I expected and exactly as the
cpu has performed since I first reviewed
it in most productivity workloads the
new GPU doesn't come into play so you'll
get the standard product
every performance we've seen from these
sorts of laptops for about a year now if
you want a full performance breakdown of
the kora 78758 it is worth checking out
my original review from April last year
but we'll go through some performance
summaries here comparing the new Aero 15
X 9 to the older era 15 X v8 performance
is roughly equivalent there were a few
workloads like Cinebench where the new
model is a little slower there were a
handful of workloads like handbrake
where performance is on par and there
are a few tasks where the new morale is
faster when breaking down these faster
workloads we have two factors at play
there are 15 X 9 I reviewed has dual
channel DVR for 2666 memory which
provides higher bandwidth than the
single channel configuration in the era
of 15 X v8 with 16 gigabytes of RAM so
for tasks like 7-zip and MATLAB there's
a performance advantage due to this then
we also see some improvements in GPU
accelerated applications premier doesn't
benefit significantly from the faster RT
x 2070 max-q because the GPU is
basically doing all it can here to
accelerate rendering after about gtx
1070 max q level there's not much else
to be gained from extra GPU performance
in our test blender does see a large
improvement notice to the tune of 26% in
this workload run entirely on the GPU I
guess the good news is depending on your
workload you can expect either the same
performance as other I 78758 systems or
perhaps a little better thanks to the
fast cheap you that said the 16 gigabyte
Aero 15 X 9 is still single tunnel so in
those memory bandwidth limited tasks it
won't be as fast as I'm showing here but
also worth pointing out that the Aero 15
X 9 has several different profiles that
can affect performance
aside from manual controls there's quiet
normal and gaming fan profiles in
addition we have the AI features of
which there are two modes the green
local mode analyzes what you are doing
on your system locally and attempts to
find the right performance and fan
profiles for the task at hand while the
Red Cloud mode moves that AI work to the
cloud for potentially better results
however for CPU limited workloads
whether short or long I found that so
long as you even using at least the
normal fan mode there really isn't much
difference in performance so the i/o
modes didn't do much to enhance the
performance for gaming the AI modes are
an improvement upon the normal fan mode
especially the cloud mode
however using either the gaming mode or
setting fan speeds to maximum provides
better performance again for our gaming
tests which I'll get to in a moment
I use the gaming mode I think the AI
morals they do have a bit of promise
especially if they can learn over time
as to what Moe's deliver the best
performance this is still early days for
the era of 15 X 9 and this system it'd
be cool if it delivered optimal
performance while also tuning the fan
speeds because the gaming mode is still
quite loud in general but at least for
now
sticking to the gaming mode while in the
GPU heavy tasks is the best choice few
other quick productivity comparisons
here before moving into gaming
performance if you're upgrading from a
core i7 7700 HQ laptop or another one of
Intel's quad-core 45 watt notebook CPUs
the six core Core i7
8750 h2 is about 35 percent more
performance on average though in heavily
multi-threaded tasks gains can be up
around 50 percent if you do a lot of
rendering work on the go it's definitely
worth the upgrade to access those extra
to cause and then if you're considering
whether it's worth buying a
performance-oriented portable laptop
over a 15 watt ultra portable he said
the eye 78758 stacks up against Intel's
latest whiskey lake core i7 85 65 you in
CPU workloads we're looking at double
the performance for encouraging and when
factoring in the significantly more
powerful GPU pretty much becomes a
bloodbath
any serious creative work on the go a
configuration like the Aero 15 X 9 with
the six core CPU and discrete GPU is
definitely the best option for gaming
performance I've already done a full
breakdown on the new NVIDIA GeForce r-tx
2070 max Q used in this exact system for
look at each game and more discussion on
the GPU in particular it's well worth
watching that in-depth video here though
I do want to provide a few summaries the
new Aero 15 X 9 is 11 percent faster on
average than the era 15 X v8 with the
gtx 1070 max Q and this margin is
typical when comparing the erofeev gain
X 9 to other 1070 max-q laptops do know
that this is the margin you'll see when
comparing equivalent memory
configurations diversión this laptop
with 16 gig of ram is only a single
channel so there is upgrading from a
dual channel laptop will see smaller
margins however there's not much to be
gained moving from a fully
we're jtx 1072 and r-tx 2070 max-q as
performance is roughly equivalent it's
nice that new laptops include more
performance in the same form factor but
the increase isn't massive the GTX 1080
max Q is still faster than the RT X 2070
max Q if you are tossing up between
those two GPUs on the other hand the art
X 2070 max do smokes the GTX 1066
gigabyte to the tune of 35% on average
so this new GPU is a worthwhile upgrade
and finally please don't think that the
ITX 2070 laptop will provide the same
performance as a desktop RTX 2070 in
videos nutrient GPUs have widened the
desktop laptop GPU gap compared to
Pascal so the art X 27 Tikal app drops
is considerably slower than the desktop
equivalent oh and I guess I should
mention RT X features here concern you
can use those with this new art X
between 70 max Q laptop compared to
older Pascal laptops unfortunately the
ITX performance of invidious laptop GPUs
isn't very strong in battlefield 5
you're looking at a experience below 60
FPS at 1080p with the low DXi mode
compared to well over 80 FPS with
ray-tracing disabled dealer says is also
not an effective feature as we've talked
about separately some idea is to treat
RT X is more of a bonus than a key
feature because support for it simply
isn't wide enough or good enough right
now to make it a must-have inclusion
while the gigabyte r15 performs well for
its hardware the cooling solution isn't
amazing to deliver top-end performance
in line with other systems the gaming
fan mode should be used which really
ramps up the fans to a higher degree
this mode is loud at 48 DBA
which keeps the area 15 on the bottom of
the chart as one of the loudest
notebooks I've tested it is an area the
AI mode could really help except it
simply doesn't perform as well as the
loud gaming mode you better news noise
levels while using the laptop for
productivity tasks is a lot better it's
still not a quiet system and a touch
under 40 DBA during a hand break in code
but this is mid tier among gaming
laptops this is using the normal fan
mode as the gaming mode so no additional
performance increases for CPU limited
apps at a louder
I guess performance cost thoroughly the
laptop also gets quite hot hotter than
the previous Eric 15x v8
CPU temperatures are unchanged but high
for a gaming laptop around 90 degrees
Celsius although if rattling wasn't a
big concern for CPU limited applications
thicker gaming laptops are more around
these 75 to 80 degrees Celsius mark
however GPU temperatures with the RT X
2070 max you have increased compared to
the gtx 1070 max-q now sitting around a
6 degree Celsius compared to 79 degrees
Celsius the shotty of this laptop also
gets pretty hot
the fans exhaust air through a flap
below the display in the sort of hinge
area however the position of these vents
means the hot air is redirected in front
of the display towards the keyboard most
of the laptops vent out the sides and
back either behind the display on to or
on to the desk
inventing forwards the top edge of the
laptop gets very hot up over 50 degrees
Celsius during gaming in the center near
the power button directly below this the
keyboard can be over 40 degrees Celsius
luckily the WASD Keys are cooled well
around the 30 degrees Celsius mark but
that isn't true for the entire keyboard
the thermal performance here surprises
me a bit considering what the error 15
looks like internally I guess there are
just some inefficiencies in the design
with that said the laptop is quite
upgradeable when removing the bottom
cover revealing easy access to the
memory slots and a second free M not to
slot for storage upgrades my arrow 15 X
9 review unit came with the 4k 60 Hertz
IPS display option rather than the 144
Hertz 1080p option I reviewed in the
older model the 4k option is the route
you'd take if you want to use this
laptop for creative workloads or content
creation has really 4k is too intensive
for the art X 2070 max Q for gaming
instead gamers would be better off with
the high refresh 1080p screen especially
as the GPU can handle many games around
the 100 FPS mark on Ultra settings at
this resolution while this display is
supposedly x-rite Pantone certified
unfortunately I have a few issues with
the 4k panel in its calibration this is
a wide gamut monitor targeting 100% of
Derby RGB and it comes with what is
supposed to be factory calibration
through a profile that's been installed
however the profile has been generated
incorrectly it looks like gigabyte has
mapped the displays wide color primaries
as the sRGB color primaries which leads
to over saturation other weird behavior
I know
this oversaturation straight away
everything is extremely vibrant on this
panel proper calibration should allow
both srgb and wide gamut content to be
mapped properly with just a single
profile this is disappointing for those
that might have wanted to use the
display straight out of the box however
it could be an issue with my earlier
review sample that said as the display
is more than capable of 100% Adobe RGB
coverage calibrating it properly will
lead to good results I also recorded a
near 1400 to 1 contrast ratio which is
strong for an IPS panel along with peak
brightness of 360 nits and very good
viewing angles the panel quality is
there it's just the calibration that's
letting it down and again for gamers I
don't see much benefit in having the 4k
60 Hertz panel over the 1080p 144 Hertz
model final two bits of performance the
intel SSD 760 P used in the area 15 X 9
is extremely fast one of the fastest
SSDs available in modern gaming laptops
so that's nice
then for battery life there's a huge 94
watt hour battery in this particular
model I did some brief testing not
anything extensive here but I did find
that the model performed slightly less
than the previous generation arrow 15
and in line with similar thin and light
laptops like this in our video playback
workload overall the gigabyte arrow 15 X
9 isn't a huge improvement over last
year's model but it does pack some nice
upgrades while in videos our text
features don't provide much in this GPU
design the ITX 2070 max Q is providing
around 10% more performance in games at
1080p which you take every time
considering there's no change to the
form factor the improved trackpad is a
long-overdue addition as well and some
of the new software tools aren't game
changes but could become promising over
time these changes have been made
without sacrificing the other elements
that already made this laptop great is
still a well-built portable design with
a huge battery the core 78758 performs
the same making the laptop great for
productivity
there's still a 1080p 144 Hertz display
option for gamers and when calibrated
properly the 4k screen option is great
for creators there's plenty of i/o and
easy internal upgrade ability for both
the RAM and storage the poky RGB backlit
keyboard is also still one of the best
in its class with that said two of my
primary concerns with this laptop design
haven't been
rest the cooler is still loud and it
runs hot to deliver performance
equivalent to other systems the webcam
position is also not great a byproduct
of this early bezel free design whether
the arrow 15 X 9 is a good purchase
comes down to what price you can get one
out right now for a decent hardware
loadout you're looking at twenty four
hundred US dollars I don't think it's
worth paying this price while gtx 1070
max few laptops are still around yeah
the 1070 max-q is a bit slower but you
can get a slimming light system such as
the soos ROG Zephyrus s for under $2,000
right now I'd happily sacrifice the
extra ten percent of in terms of
performance to save $500 or even more in
some cases
but of course gtx 1070 max your tops
won't be around for much longer so what
about when the market is just r-tx 20 70
devices but right now there's only a few
thin unlike gaming machines that use the
ITX 20 70 max cube the main options are
the msi gio 65 stealth and the razor
blade 15 ems option is the same price
and while i haven't tested the ITX
version yet last year i did have a
slight preference for it over the arrow
15 although both are great choices the
new blade 15 from razor is $200 more
expensive in packs a small SSD and while
raises current gen design is very nice i
don't think it's worth the price premium
but as is always the case with these
portable gaming machines you'd really
want to have the portability because
there are better fast options available
in thicker heavier Sassy's both the
souza and gigabyte often the full r-tx
2070 model in their thicker Sassy's for
$2000 that's a better value option if
you don't see yourself moving the laptop
around very much so that's it for this
review of a gigabyte arrow 15 X 9 I'm
still trying to get in a range of other
r-tx laptops so we can have a look at
the full lineup in the coming months
again a bit of a slow process doing
