are exploring Athlon 200g overclocking
yeah an unexpected turn of events it's
now possible to overclock the locked
200g the semi sometimes locked 200g ii
this appears to be a slip-up by msi with
their latest round of fast updates for
all of their am 4 motherboards about two
weeks ago now msi released a new bios
revision for their full range of a m4
motherboards to include support for the
latest version of AMD's generic
encapsulated software architecture
otherwise known as AG esa or a geesa
geesa only go through G so this latest
feature improves memory support by
enhancing overclocking and compatibility
and also adds a virtualization related
feature that enables the ability to
manually assign PCIe graphics cards
within iommu groups anyway improved
support is great and all that but what
we're mostly interested in for today's
video is the fact that the Athlon 200g
can now be overclocked on msi
motherboards after looking into this it
is indeed true I've also tried a few
asrock be 350 and be 450 boards but
sadly none of those allowed me to
overclock for 200 GE however all the MSI
a m4 motherboards I tried it did and
this included a few budget be 350 boards
right up to the higher-end be 450 models
such as the gaming Pro carbon for
example I'm yet to try any of these
suits or gigabyte boards but I will
update you guys with those results in
the comment section below so far though
I've only seen reports of this working
on MSI boards so it seems as though MSI
has made a bit of a mistake here a happy
accident for budget enthusiasts it would
seem the good news is the genie is out
of the bottle on this one and there's
very little at MSI or AMD you can do to
put it back in
I suppose MSI can lock the 200g back
down with a future bias revision but
that doesn't change the fact that you
can now get the November release and
start overclocking so to avoid being
locked out you just wouldn't over you
just wouldn't update your bios to the
newer version until you upgrade your CPU
down the track with the Ajitha 1.0 0.6
firmware in
on the MSI motherboard you simply need
to enter the BIOS and apply a standard
multiplier overclock my 200g wouldn't
post at 4 gigahertz
I wouldn't 3.9 gigahertz but even with
1.5 volts it wasn't stable and windows
at 3.8 gigahertz it was 100% stable with
1.3 5 volts so that's what I went with
as that seems to make the most sense
here
unfortunately the ddr4 memory is still
locked down so I was limited to ddr4
2666 but you can trim the timings to
improve performance there but I haven't
done that for the testing in this video
for testing I have used CL 14 memory
since that's not overly expensive at the
2402 2666 speeds so i thought that would
make the most sense
when compared to the stock out of the
box configuration I was able to increase
the core frequency by 19% from 3.2
gigahertz to 3 point 8 gigahertz and not
an earth-shattering increase but every
little bit does help here especially
we're talking about a 55 dollar dual
core Zen processor unfortunately I don't
have the 200g box cooler so I'm using
the Wraith stealth for all of the
overclocking in this video and that's
how I suspected the Box cooler will
probably facilitate this overclock as
the race stealth peaked at just 59
degrees and that's really respectable
quite cool and that was after an hour
long blender stress test with an ambient
room temperature of 21 degrees for
testing the graphics card used is the
gigabyte r-tx 2080 TI and yes I know
it's an unrealistic GPU to pair with
this CPU but I want to be able to
directly compare this data with the data
from higher-end CPUs that I've already
tested and frankly it really makes no
difference as I've recently proven the
margins 1080p and the same with the gtx
1070 using these low-end CPUs then of
course the entire point of testing and
pairing these CPUs is to test CPU
performance what a shocker
not low-end GPU performance so using a
gtx 1050 for example would tell us
absolutely nothing about these CPUs and
be completely pointless for those that
want to keep the CPU for a generation or
more anyway with all of that made quite
clear I believe let's just jump into the
results first up we have these Cinebench
r15 results and here we see that our 19%
overclock has improved the
multi-threaded score by
13% so not too bad that's just 4% lower
than I simulated 3.9 gigahertz overclock
using the risin 5 2400 G with half the
cores disabled it's worth noting that
this overclock allowed the 200 G to
overtake the Pentium G 5400 by a small
margin
testing with Corona shows a me 7% time
reduction for the render tests are not
amazing but it does place the 200 G much
closer to the Pentium G 5400 in this
test running our overclock through the
blender render test shows a more
impressive 14% reduction in render time
and this now places the 200 G miles
ahead of the AVX lacking pentium g 5400
so good stuff here but I think now it's
time to check out some gaming benchmarks
testing with Assassin's Creed Odyssey we
see at the overclocked 200 G now offers
a 9% boost for the average framerate and
a much-needed 15% boost to the frame
time performance the game played
noticeably smooth with the 200g
overclocked so while the games don't
seem that significant they actually are
we find a similar story with Assassin's
Creed origins and now the overclocked
200 G is able to match the average frame
rate of the Pentium G 5400 but kill it
for the frame time performance testing
with battlefield 1 revealed a really
nice 14% increase in average frame rate
performance at 1080p going from 71 FPS
to 81 fps once overclocked we also see
some pretty solar performance gains in
Forza horizon 4 and 9 percent boost was
enough to just push the 200 G ahead of
the more expensive Pentium G 5400 then
we sent the gains in hitman were quite
substantial a 16% booster see at 1080p
as the 200 G went from a stock result of
38 FPS to an overclocked result of 44
fps and now the experience is miles
better than what you get with the
pentium g 5400 here we have another nice
performance gain this time with project
cars - going from 56 FPS on average to
63 FPS at 1080p once overclocked
basically it's a free 13 percent bump in
frame rate the Rainbow six siege results
are interesting as the overclocked 200 G
is still slower than the G 5400 at 1080p
but somehow it does do much better at
1440p whatever
the case we again see some decent
performance gains from the overclock
previously I was having a few issues
with the Athlon 200g in star wars
battlefront 2 but a recent game patch
seems to have solved that I'm not sure
of it to relate it or not but the game
does load much faster on the 200-year
and it actually plays a lot better we
also see a big 16% boost to the average
frame rate when overclocking the Athlon
processor taking us from 67 FPS to 78
FPS at 1080p and here it was much faster
than the pinch in G 5400 last up we have
shut off the Tomb Raider and please note
you will see considerably better frame
rates using the built-in canned
benchmark as it's not very CPU intensive
and it mainly focuses on GPU performance
so actually playing the game on a
low-end CPU will provide very different
results and results like what you see
here overclock the 200g boosted frame
rates by 12% which is decent but truth
be told this game is a bit beyond an SMT
enabled dual-core that isn't clocked
beyond 5 gigahertz so there you have it
with the right motherboard you can now
overclock the Athlon 200 G and Bruce
gaming performance but as much as 16%
which is no small margin for an
entry-level CPU as far as I know right
now you will need an MSI motherboard for
this overclock and for those shopping
for a new option it's just something
like the B 450 M Pro vdh as it cost just
$70 and then you can throw the $55
turnigy on that you have a pretty decent
ultra affordable combo once overclocked
alternatively if you're after a
placeholder using the 200 G as a
placeholder until then 2 arrives then
the 200 G will work on a better quality
board such as the B 450 a gaming Pro
carbon that I used for this video having
said all that I strongly suggest you
spend the extra $45 on the rise and 322
energy and then you can overclock that
if you want to that's just a much more
capable processor and once you factor in
the cost of a really basic $70 B 450
board it means you're only paying about
35% more for that combo and then if you
throw in 16 gigabytes of ddr4 memory
then you're down to like a 20% premium
for the much faster 2200 gu anyway let
me know what you think of the
overclocked Athlon turnigy down the
