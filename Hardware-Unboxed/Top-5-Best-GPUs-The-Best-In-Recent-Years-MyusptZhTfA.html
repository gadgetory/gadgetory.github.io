getting super serious with another top
five best video yeah as always these are
just a bit of fun and this one is
actually a follow-up to last month's top
5 worst GPUs
I asked viewers what their top 5 best
GPU list looks like and only looking at
GPUs though that have been released in
the last 5 years or so
many of you came back with very
similar-looking listen many of them were
choices that I also nominated myself so
I've taken what I think are the best 5
from the list suggested added a little
few of my own in and this should make
for a nice stroll down a GPU memory lane
it was a hot summer's day here in
Victoria Australia when the Radeon HD
7950 was released on the 24th of
February 2012 temperatures soared to 37
degrees and I remember it like it was
yesterday actually that's a lie I just
looked up the weather history graph but
I'm sure it was a nice day nonetheless
anyway we're not here to recall the
weather but rather pay tribute to AMD's
second-in-command of the illustrious
Tahiti series the Radeon HD 7950 played
second fiddle only to the 7970 and with
a release date MSRP of just 330 dollars
u.s. it was considered a real bargain at
the time price to be 40% more affordable
than the 7970 and it packed just five
and a half percent fewer cause because
that it could be overclocked to actually
match and even beat the stock 7970 it
also brushed off in videos then current
flagship the GTX 580 which cost five
hundred dollars and it was also 30%
faster than Amy's previous generation
flagship part the Radeon HD 6970
somebody even say it aged like a bottle
of fine wine almost six years later it's
still able to provide very playable
performance at 1080p and modern titles
and it certainly fared much better than
nvidias GTX 750 over the years that
particular model was released two months
prior for 350 dollars
no I'm not trolling you guys but I bet a
few of you wish I was when I put
together my top 5 worst GPU list many of
you voiced concern about a lack of a GTX
970 even today with very little evidence
to support the argument some claim that
the GTX 970 is a broken GPU that's
suffering from its borked rear buffer
the GTX 970 was a highly controversial
GPU released by Nvidia and yet despite
that one of their most successful ever
out of the gate the GTX 970 was met with
rave reviews for its unbeatable value
shortly after the glowing reviews though
it was discovered roughly 13% of the
full gigabyte video and buffer was
partitioned off limiting it to a much
narrower memory bus so while the card
did technically have 4 gigabytes of
memory on board it wasn't actually
capable of the performance claimed
rather the GPU was limited to a memory
throughput of 196 gigabytes per second
when working from the primary partition
in just 28 gigabytes for the smaller
half gigabyte partition this however
didn't change the fact that at the time
the glowing performance seen in reviews
was the exact same performance gamers
were receiving the worry though was that
as gaming titles inevitably came more
bandwidth hungry the GTX 970 would fall
into a complete heap this is a
legitimate concern
at least to a certain extent despite the
controversy though and the negative
backlash this GPU really helps to
strengthen invidious position and it
became one of their best-selling GPUs of
all time today the GTX 970 is still
going strong according to my own
findings and at recently impressed us in
destiny - even at 1440p
AMD's r9 290 went on sale in November of
2013 an MSRP of just $400 US making it
27% more affordable than the 290x that
was a fantastic value when you can sit
at the other interneuron he should never
be more than say 9% slower than the r9
290x and in fact on average it was just
five percent slower according to my
tests so in a sense the Unown 290 made
the r9 290x redundant much like the gtx
780 did to the gtx titan as good as the
290 was though it wasn't without a few
shortcomings a m-- d-zone 290 series
cards ran very hot that's the reference
cool I'm talking about and they did hit
temperatures as high as 95 degrees in a
matter of minutes when gaming this issue
though was later sold by board partners
as models from the likes of gigabyte MSI
honest Zeus I featured much bigger
coolers with triple fan designs the key
thing to note here though is that back
in 2013 the antonioni really put the
heat on the GTX 780 nits was so good
that AMD decided to rebrand it as the r9
390 for 330 dollars where it would do
battle with the more modern gtx 970 a
battle that it ultimately lost if you
look at the sales figures but today the
r9 290 and r9 390 are still going very
strong and they certainly are still
taking it to the gtx 970 and even more
modern GPUs in fact in a good number of
games the r9 290 still hangs in there
very respectably with the mid-range
offerings such as the GTX 10 16 R X 480
anyway all the worries remember the r9
290 as an awesome value high end GPU
from 2013 and even now in 2017 it still
packs quite the punch and it will no
doubt continue to serve gamers well for
years to come
nvidia really impressed us with the
efficiency and performance of the
maxwell based geforce gtx 980 back in
2015 then nine months later sox were
blown completely off and barefoot gamers
everywhere was shocked by how mighty the
gtx 980ti was back in 2015 with almost
40 percent more cuda cores than the GTX
980 the new Ti model was a complete and
utter beast
later that month AMD tried to spoil the
party with their Radeon r9 fury X and
AMD fans boasted about 10 percent
performance bumps over the gtx 980ti but
just turned out to be wishful thinking
and was quickly drowned out by the sound
of whining pumps anyway the gtx 980ti
did remain the performance champ and
even to this day it's still a good bit
faster a major advantage the 980ti had
over the fury acts was its insane
overclocking Headroom it was very easy
to extract around 20% more performance
from the GeForce graphics card and if
comparing overclocking results well that
was just a complete death blow to the
fury X today heavily overclocked gtx 980
eyes can match overclocked gtx 1070 Safi
paid $650 almost two and a half years
ago you've got a pretty good deal as it
is making $400 GPU performance today
with the exception of the gtx 1080i
the 980ti is probably the most
impressive flagship GPU we've seen in
many years
now give it everything I just said about
the Radeon r9 fury acts it seems a bit
strange to be ending this round up on
the Radeon r9 fury the the baby fury
which is actually physically the largest
of them all but anyway after releasing
the compact liquid-cooled fury X AMD
went on to release a much larger 9 X
version which was just simply called the
fury I had 13 percent fuel caused but
for the most part it wasn't really that
much slower and at $550 it was quite a
bit cheaper this price stood alongside
the GTX 980 and even today the two do
still trade blows the r9 fury though it
really suffered due to a lack of supply
and shockingly just two of AMD partners
were able to supply Fury graphics card
and that was a soos and Sapphire earlier
this year though was possible to
purchase either the isuzu or sapphire
models for under 250 dollars u.s. and at
that price they were insane bargains of
course cryptocurrency mining has spoiled
that as it has for all GPU sales and now
they're pretty much impossible to buy
anyway still the Radeon r9 Fury has
continued to age well so those are
snapped one up chief will be grinning
from ear to ear and hopefully in the
not-too-distant future you'll once again
be able to find one online for an
irresistible price but even if they
never present themselves as a good value
option again they did provide bargain
hunters with some excitement in early
2017 well there you have it announced
time to let me have it in the comments
below if you happen to agree with me
though my picks then that probably
places you in the minority so rather
than miss out on all the action let me
know if you've come across any truly
horrible power supplies from well-known
brands but a few of my own to share in a
future video I'd love to hear if you
guys have any of your own stories to
share
actually I'll quickly tell you just one
of mine I once had a 1200 watt power
supply from a well known brand catch on
fire and a LAN party and burned through
the ventilation in the bottom of the
case and scorch the surface that the PC
was sitting on the most shocking part
was while flames and smoke were
billowing from the PC it just kept on
gaming it wasn't until I grabbed the
power cord and pulled it
the wall the system shut down and then
we just had a horrible smell and a
better table to deal with anyway as
always I'm keen to read all your
comments and maybe even leave a cheeky
reply or two I'm your host Steve see you
again soon guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
