boxes with Matt we are now at episode 9
and you might notice that I've only got
two boxes well unfortunately we can't
always fill the whole desk but let's get
straight into it I'm gonna open this
shrink wrap one first I'll them back to
using my trusty knife this one's from a
data it's mostly hair Wow yeah ha got my
name on it this just called the a data
SE 732 250 gigabyte drive USB external
storage and a data claim that this will
wipe the floor with the Samsung t3 which
are viewed probably a couple of months
ago and I'm still using this thing
that's awesome so I'll open it up we can
take a good look
so that's all there isn't a package a
quick installation guide and short
little USB type-c cable here's the drive
itself supa dupa light that sort of
Goldie was like rose gold that's about
this endless open up there we go so that
all n pops off is just a little LED
light indicator in there and the USB
type-c plug so that's what we've got the
other end tells me that it's ip68
waterproof so i think that's just splash
resistant but that's why they've got
this end that plugs in like that
so since I don't have too many products
to get through today I'm actually going
to run a quick benchmark using this
thing and we might compare it to the t3
and now and see if a data right about it
being faster than the t3 got my trusty
raise a laptop here all right so maybe
20 minutes has passed since the last cut
and I've had a few technical issues
first I've plugged this a data thing
into my razor laptop and just nothing
popped up so I waited you know a normal
amount of time nothing seemed to be
happening so I was like okay is there
something wrong with this cable dry it
with this other cheaper cable got the
same thing so I was like okay maybe it's
the a data drive so I tested with the
Samsung t3 and that popped up
immediately so then by chance i plug
this thing back in waited around 30
seconds to a minute and eventually pops
up so for some reason there's some sort
of delay between plugging this in and it
popping up and you being able to use it
and that seems to be ever present like
it wasn't just the first time so don't
deal with that is it could be pretty
annoying if you want to plug it in
quickly and get stuff off it or whatever
so haven't done my review yet unless I
can work it out that's probably
something that uh it's not really a good
feature anyway so then once I got it
working it all set up working open
crystal dears mark and it took forever
to prepare and then it ran the benchmark
and I was getting USB 2 speeds so tried
on the other port on the razor laptop
same thing so have no idea what zeal is
there but I swapped to my good old
trusty Samsung old bang a laptop and it
seems to be working well all right I'm
gonna give you some riveting footage
charities in real time
to check the straight away this time
surely this is some sort of anomaly I I
really think would be quite annoying if
you actually to deal with this every
time sir waiting okay it was relatively
fast compared to our previous effort but
that's still super slow and annoying
I'll show you the t-34 comparison well
straight away a couple of seconds max so
yeah it'd be interesting to investigate
whether you know I've got a faulty drive
or some sort but it doesn't seem like it
it seems to work aside from that anyway
let's give it a test run and see what it
can actually do alright so first we'll
benchmark the t32 set the benchmark
alrighty so the sequential read was for
21 and the sequential write was 387 so
it'll be interesting to see what the a
diver drive gets so just wait for this
to finish and the plug this in and go
all rights no benchmark the eight-hour
drive
all right so it looks like the a dot is
about 70 makes per second down on Reed
and the rides without the same I'll be
benchmarking it when I do the review
obviously my core i7 test system so see
if the results are any different there
but my samsung laptop that looks like
the t3 takes the cake alright so now
we've got that out of the way which was
meant to be quick and easy I'll move on
to the last box
very cool so on hand I've got the saunas
fusion Thunderbolt three PCI flash drive
so meant to be a super duper fast
Thunderbolt drive let's pop it out of
the box and take a look fraction I've
just noticed it's so nice not son asset
confusing fun I so here's the drive
itself looks like a heatsink pretty much
of course you need Thunderbolt
connectivity and whatever the devices
using so map uses this is probably
primarily designed for so I'm going to
do my best to give it a test run in the
razor laptop but uh hopefully have a bit
more life than last time something's a
little annoying about this does have
Thunderbolt however it's also the
charging cable so you can't do both at
once and there's no daisy chain with no
just Thunderbolt driver ports so
hopefully I've got enough charge and
hopefully it actually works the deal
would be stunned about three things is
it does use the USB 3.1 type specs so
it's got a type so you connect up but
you can't just use it in any type
seaport you do have to have a
thunderbolt 3 enable port so this laptop
does have one just leave Dean to test
huge alright looks like it has so we'll
be running Christmas Mass
I there you go this thing is
astonishingly fast the Box advertiser's
up to 2.1 geek per second today we've
gotten 1.4 so still ridiculously fast
unfortunately this thing actually costs
like 800 us or something like that so
it's uh yeah not very accessible to the
everyday consumer I think the lack of
speed today was possibly due to the
Thunder bought three implementation on
this ray as a laptop but I'm not really
sure not sure if I'll get around to
reviewing this thing but I may do so if
enough of you guys are interested so let
me know alrighty so thanks for joining
me for what seemed to be the unboxing
boxes storage edition have a great week
and keep your eye out for my review on
the a data drive hopefully f9 out all
the bugs and we can get some good
results alright see you guys next time
cheers guys for joining me for another
