corner the good news is it's currently
not 40 degrees Celsius here so I can
make this news corner I guess without as
much trouble as last week and the extra
good news is there is a range of
interesting topics to cover this week so
let's kick things off with a couple of
Intel stories first up is the official
launch of the Xeon w31 75 X intel's
monster 28 called workstation CPU this
chip was first announced sort of at
Computex last year and it's finally here
packing a 3.1 gigahertz base called a
maximum 4.5 gigahertz turbo clock has 44
lens of pcie 3.0 and at 255 watt TDP it
requires an LGA 36:47 motherboard like
the isuzu Dominus extreme along with a
huge power supply and 6 channel memory
reviews for this CPU went live a couple
of days ago unfortunately we didn't get
sampled one and it's unlikely we will
but the good news is a number of other
outlets did and you should go read their
reviews if you are interested there's
really not a whole lot that's unexpected
here it's the usual story for a hike or
count CPU if you have a workload that
can make use of the extra cores
performances up to 50 percent better
than the Quran 999 ATX II though of
course in a lot of workloads you won't
see performance at that level the
troopers also unlocked and can be
overclocked though it uses a lot of
power when you do so still need a good
power supply for that sort of thing post
the most surprising aspect was the final
price Intel settled on which was two
thousand nine hundred and ninety nine
dollars this is their most expensive
workstation CPU but early rumors were
suggesting a price closer to $4,500 that
said three thousand dollars is about as
high as Intel could have realistically
priced this CPU considering the 18 core
99 80 XE is about $2,000 in the CPU is
up to 50% faster it doesn't look like
amazing value up against the red rip up
but then again Intel's a TDT lineup
hasn't been that for some time anyway
however you won't be able to purchase
one of these CPUs off the shop at least
for
until are exclusively selling it to
system integrators and OAM so if you
want a 31 75 X you'll have to buy an
entire system this isn't a bad idea
considering you'd need to buy a special
motherboard and cooler anyway and it's
really designed for professional
workstations rather than enthusiastic it
probably will still disappoint a few
people next Intel story relates to their
new f-series processors which denote a
CPU with a disabled IGP until announced
these chips CES a couple of weeks back
but did so without any firm pricing well
earlier this week the chips have begun
to appear in retail channels including
US retailer B&amp;amp;H photo and video oddly
the f-series chips are priced higher
than the models with the eye GPU enabled
the crow $9.99 hundred K F for example
was listed at $582 50 competitors 530
dollars for the I $9.99 hundred K
similarly the core i7 9700 KF was four
hundred and fifty-two dollars 50
compared to 400 $10 to the 9700 K and
the 9600 K F at three hundred and eight
dollars seventy five versus two hundred
and sixty dollars for the non F model
this is likely because the F models are
new and could be limited in stock Intel
suggested retail price for the boxed
versions of these processes is identical
whether it's the F model or not the 9900
K for example is listed at $499 as is
the 9900 KF although of course neither
CPU is available that price right now
that said not sure how many F models
that will actually sell if both are the
same price there isn't much of a reason
to buy a 9900 KF over 9900 K both are
the same price as I guess we're not
really expecting any performance
differences another Intel story this
time relating to the kora 990 900 T this
CPU was spotted as an engineering sample
on Yahoo options of all places the the
1900 T is basically in 9900 K except
with a much harsher power limit while
the 9900 K has a listed 95 watt TDP
the 9900 t comes in at 35 watts leading
to a much lower clock speeds it's still
an eight-core 16 thread CPU but instead
of having a base clock of 3.6 gigahertz
with a boost up to 5 gigahertz the 90
t-slot sitting with just a 1.7 gigahertz
base and a boost of only 3.8 gigahertz
intel typically releases 80 series of
skews for low-power systems those that
either need to run at low levels of
power consumption or are a small
form-factor and can't pack in enough
cooling capacity for the fully fledged
chips in these situations having an 8
core CPU at lower clocks may be the best
option that said there's still no
official word about these SKUs just yet
final Intel story is a quicker one the
company has named Robert Swan as CEO
after a seven-month search Swan has been
Intel CFO since 2016 and was also the
interim CEO after Brian krzanich left in
June 2018 I don't really pay much
attention to corporate structures of
companies so I don't have any other
comments on this but it seems like
investors weren't super happy as stock
prices took a bit of a dip after the
announcement
speaking of stock prices taking a dip
after announcements Nvidia this week
drastically altered their q4 revenue
guidance originally the company expected
2.7 billion in revenue from the fourth
quarter but now they've cut that by five
hundred million dollars to just 2.2
billion as a result Nvidia stock price
tanked by more than 12 percent a
combination of factors contributed to
this drop in revenue the cryptocurrency
market is the first reason
Nvidia initially responded to a spike in
demand by producing more Pascal GPUs
only to have demand then drop off when
those GPUs were already this left in
video with an excess of inventory and
were forced to delay a planned
production ramp of several new products
the second issue was the launch of
cheering in general lackluster reception
for NVIDIA snoo GPUs which Jensen partly
blamed on a lack of r-tx support actual
games nah but I think that was a real
reason has led to lower than expected
sales NVIDIA has also suggested that
gamers are waiting for price drops
before buying although again envy you
really only have themselves to blame for
that one as they were the ones that set
the prices Nvidia also blamed a
decelerating global market particularly
in China along with unpredictability in
their data center business with all of
these factors combined Nvidia is set to
miss their original guidance by a
significant amount and that continues
the company struggles in the last half a
year or so I am
has amended their agreement with Global
Foundries this probably isn't the
biggest news out there but it's at least
a little bit interesting the basics are
the new agreement sets out pricing and
volumes for wafers AMD will purchase
from Global Foundries through to 2021 of
course we're not getting any public
details about those prices or volumes
but those have been locked in the good
news for AMD is the new agreement allows
AMD to purchase wafers at the seven
nanometer node or smaller from other
companies like TSMC or Samsung without
one-time payments or royalties to Global
Foundries not familiar with their
previous agreement but you think that
when Global Foundries were still
planning on releasing a seven nanometer
node that their agreement with AMD would
have prevented ambi from easily
switching over to TSM C without some
sort of payment AMD will continue to use
Global Foundries for products built on
12 nanometer nodes or larger so this
would include their send plus CPUs and
ap use that they'll continue to be
selling the i/o die for news then to
products and most of their current GPU
lineup if aim D failed to meet their
agreed upon annual wafer purchase amount
they'll have to pay a portion of the
difference between their actual
purchases and the target previously ambi
had to pay the full amount regardless of
how many wafers they actually needed so
this is an improvement as well in gaming
news I'm sure you've all heard about the
controversy regarding Metro Exodus
leaving steam for the epic game store in
case you haven't heard
Metro Exodus will now be sold
exclusively through the epic game store
although anyone who already pre-ordered
through Steam will be able to download
the game updates and only further DLC as
planned the likely reason behind this is
epic offers a larger cut for developers
and publishers than steam and this cut
could be even better if they sign an
exclusivity deal at least I'm assuming
but the news angered a lot of gamers who
understandably felt like the exclusivity
was a bit of a shafting here and sudden
switches well seems to have rubbed
people the wrong way
old metro games did get review bombed on
Steam and there have been lots of
complaints don't II have many thoughts
on this I'd personally prefer every game
to be released on Steam because there
has in my opinion the best functionality
out of the game stores and launchers and
salsa with most of my libraries but I
also don't mind a bit of competition I
guess that said
I think exclusivity deals probably the
best way to go about generating
competition a chemical issue at TS mcs
fab 14 b has affected yields for some
customers including nvidia Iowa and
mediatek a photoresist chemical used in
production deviated from specifications
and that caused lower than normal yields
for recently processed wafers TSMC says
some shipments will have to be delayed
into quarter two as a result but doesn't
know how much of a financial impact you
will have at this stage final topic of
this week we now have confirmed
specifications for invidious mobile
GeForce RT x-series
the company officially launched these
GPUs earlier this week alongside all new
laptops we should have a few reviews
coming up soon but the specs themselves
are worth looking at while the mobile RT
X 2060 2070 and 2080 all packed the same
kuduk or counts and memory
configurations as their desktop
counterparts clock speeds are lower
across the board and have wide ranges in
the case of some products the ITX 20 AE
for example is clocked at a 1515
megahertz base with a rated boost of
1710 megahertz on the desktop but for
laptops the highest configuration of
this GPU will top out at just a 13 80
megahertz base with a 1590 megahertz
boost
however we could see some max-q variants
clocked as low as a 735 megahertz base
and a 1095 megahertz boost which is
quite low that's a pretty huge range as
well with a similarly large range in TD
piece Nvidia says 80 to a hundred and
fifty plus watts seems like there could
be some noticeable differences between
each r-tx laptop depending on the
configuration here it's a similar story
for the RT X 2070 desktop cards are
clocked up to a 16 20 megahertz boost
while laptops top out at 14 40 megahertz
excluding GPU boost 3.0 of course which
often pushes well above those rated
speeds the ITX 2060 as well again
desktop cards clock up to 16 80
megahertz pin in laptops we're facing
just 12 hundred megahertz clocks
it seems that Nvidia have aggressively
down clock these GPUs to fit into
certain TDP categories for example the
RT X 2060 is up to an 90 watt part in
laptops whereas the desktop card is
rated for a hundred and 60 watts with
such a huge
difference there's bound to be a large
performance drop here and it's the same
for the other parts at 175 watts and 215
watts which have been reduced to a
hundred and fifteen Watts 150 watts
respectively in some ways this does make
sense as laptops you know they don't
have the same cooling capabilities as
desktop CPUs and truing cards aren't
noticeably more efficient than Pascal
cards that came before them so
realistically there shouldn't be a large
jump in performance that's available for
a laptop with the same cooling power but
it's definitely disappointing that
unlike with Pascal where laptop GPUs
were roughly on par with desktop
equivalents that chewing laptops will
likely perform a bit slower than their
desktop variants we'll evaluate this in
the coming weeks as there RTX laptop
samples arrive anyway that's it for this
