tap the Bell welcome back to hard brown
box last month Intel completed their
rollout of eighth generation Core
processors for laptops introducing
coffee lake h-series parts such as the
core i7 8750 h at the time we saw lots
of new laptops hit the market for both
productivity oriented users and game√≠s
so i think it's about time i deliver my
picks of the top 5 best gaming laptops
you can buy right now in this video
we'll be splitting things up into five
categories covering high-end gaming
laptops more budget-friendly devices as
well as the best Ultrabook that can
double up as a gaming machine
that's enough introduction let's get
straight into the pics
we're kicking things off here with our
personal favorite category of gaming
laptops portable designs with tons of
power I've already reviewed a handful of
these devices on the channel over the
last few years but a few standout that
come loaded with the latest Core i7 87
58 from Intel the best of the bunch so
far is the msi gr6 t5 stealth thin we
were always a fan of MSI's previous thin
gaming laptop in the GS 63 but the GS 65
is an improvement in every way it has
slimmer bezel surrounding a faster 144
Hertz 1080p display and that helps
shrink the entire footprint off the
laptop it's still very thin and light
for this class of device and the new
design with gold highlights looks better
than ever
it certainly is MSI's most refined
laptop build yet as for gaming
performance the GS 65 comes with two GPU
options a gtx 1060 or gtx 1070 max-q
either option is a sound choice of their
respective price points though the gtx
1070 max-q model is better suited to
gaming on the 1080p high refresh display
and gives you more power in the same
form factor other features like sixteen
gig of ram and a 512 gig SSD are
standard for this laptop and its
competitors we opened for the GS 65 over
competing laptops from gigabyte and
irzu's for a couple of reasons
the GS 65 is quieter than the similar
gigabyte air of 50 and extra in gaming
and the build quality is superior with
both laptops coming in around the same
price it was a tough choice between the
GS 65 and a soos rog Zephyrus MGM 501
the Zephyrus is more powerful with a
full gtx 1070 inside rather than the max
q variant but it's also louder hotter
and more expensive as a result the J 65
has a larger battery and lasts longer to
and that's important for a gaming laptop
either the GS 65 all the Zephyrs would
be our pic depending on what you're
after but if we had to choose just one
the more well rounded GS 65 gets our
vote in this category
if you have about $1,000 to spend there
is one clear standout option the ASA
predator Helios 300 often available for
a touch over $1000 through Amazon the
Helios 300 provides the best set of
hardware you can get at this price point
combining the Intel Core i7 7700 HQ with
the nvidia geforce gtx 1066 gigabyte it
makes a great system for 1080p gaming
without breaking the bank
most other laptops available around the
$1000 price point opt for the GTX 1063
gigabyte instead which does pack lower
performance than the full 6 gig variant
in the Helios you're also still getting
16 gig of ram and an SSD boot drive
which are very important to deliver a
good gaming experience sure it doesn't
pack the latest I 78758
but you won't find that CPU in any well
priced budget laptops just yet the only
way you'll find a cheaper laptop with
the gtx 1066 gigabyte inside is if you
opt for the i5 7300 HQ instead of the i7
7700 HQ in something like the dell
inspiron 75-77 but the extra CPU power
of the core i7 and more SSDs storage
space makes the Helios 300 and
no-brainer for just a hundred bucks more
the only major downside to the Helios
300 is its mediocre display that can't
reproduce the full srgb spectrum which
is something we criticized in our review
of the laptop but I'll take that
downside knowing that inside the laptop
is the best Hardware available at that
price point
the Helios 300 we mentioned before is a
great budget buyer but if you want the
best bang for your buck you should look
no further than the Isuzu GL 5:02 vs
available for as low as one thousand
four hundred and eighty dollars but more
typically around 1600 the GL 502 vs is a
bit more expensive than the Helios 300
roughly 50% more but it does pack faster
hardware and more features the key
inclusion here is a fully fledged nvidia
geforce gtx 1070 it's not a max-q
variant and it's much faster than the
gtx 1066 gigabyte in our budget pick
typical performance gains are in the 35
to 45 percent range though it's not
unusual to see an increase that exceeds
50% in heavily GPU limited games those
performance gains are in line with the
price increase over our budget GTX 1060
laptop pick is slightly lower in the
worst case however you also get a far
superior 1080p 120 Hertz of g-sync
display in the GL 502 vs to complement
the faster cheaper you while the same
core i7 7700 HQ 16 gig of ram and 256
gig SSD is found inside this laptops
higher refresh rate display makes a huge
difference for gaming and the gtx 1070
can take full advantage when weighing
everything up the GL 502 vs delivers an
excellent price to performance ratio and
that's why it's our best bang for your
buck pick the ace of predators 17 was
also considered as it too features
similar hardware and a similar price
however it's much larger and
significantly heavier than the GL 502 vs
4 only a small price saving
let's say you happen to have a lot of
money lying around and you just want the
best mobile gaming experience money can
offer well for around four thousand
dollars we recommend the gigabyte Horace
x9 DT it's definitely not the most value
conscious option but it packs pretty
much everything you'd want the processor
inside is the fastest mobile chip Intel
currently offers the core I 989 50 HK
and yes that's a core im9 processor
we're talking about the GPU is a full
nvidia geforce gtx 1080 with 8 gig of
gddr5 x plus you get 32 gig of ram a
variety of SSD options that start at one
terabyte of nvme storage seriously if
money is no object you can get to 2
terabyte samsung 960 pros in this thing
for a mere 6500 toes we don't really
recommend spending that much on this
laptop but that's because the base model
already offers such a complete package
on top of the things I've already
mentioned you'll get a 17.3 inch 1080p
display with a 144 Hertz refresh rate
and gsync and X right Pantone
certification plus a mechanical keyboard
with perky RGB backlighting and plenty
of overclocking Headroom there are a lot
of options at the top end of laptop
pricing but we chose the Auris x9 dt for
a couple of reasons it's significantly
slimmer and lighter than other Coraline
laptops with the GTX 1080 inside and not
much more expensive in the process the
x9 isn't exactly thin or light itself
but competitors like the MSI gt70 5 and
a soos are OGG 703 a seriously massive
we also feel that more expensive gaming
laptops with SLI GTX 280s or gtex 1070 s
just aren't worth it
there are a lot of modern games that
don't properly support SLI and a laptop
with GTX 1080s and SLI can cost upwards
of 1,400 dollars more than the Auris x9
DT joy the x9 costs nearly four thousand
dollars already but we won't recommend
spending the extra money for a second
GPU even if you could afford it
not everyone out there who wants to do
some gaming on a laptop is after a
gaming laptop specifically some people
may want the high levels of portability
and productivity oriented features you
get with an ultrabook but also want to
do some gaming on the side the best
ultrabook you can get right now that
doubles up as a gaming capable machine
is the Microsoft Surface book - the 15
edge barrier of the surface book - is
available with a discreet nvidia geforce
gtx 1066 gigabyte inside most ultrabooks
top out around a gtx 1050 or 1050 Ti
with their discreet GPUs but the service
book - pushes all the way up to a gtx
1066 gigabyte which we know is very
capable for gaming on top of that you
get an intel core i7
8650 u quad core cpu 16 gig of ram at
least 256 gig of SSD space and a high
resolution 30 to 40 by 2160 display and
let's not forget all the features of the
surface book - provides the gaming
laptops don't the screen detaches from
the base and can be used as a large
tablet on the go
the display is a touchscreen and
supports active stylus input and the
whole package is compact and light
considering what you get the surface
book - with the gtx 1060 inside does
start at two thousand four hundred and
ninety nine dollars so those that want a
portable laptop primarily for gaming are
better off with the msi gs70
but as far as ultrabooks go you won't
find a more powerful option for gaming
than the surface book - and just quietly
the 13-inch model of this laptop still
comes with the gtx 1050 which is much
faster than what you typically find in
that form factor and is well worth a
look if you don't want to lug around
something as large as the 15-inch model
so those are our picks for the best 5
gaming laptops you can get right now if
you've seen any other great laptop eyes
