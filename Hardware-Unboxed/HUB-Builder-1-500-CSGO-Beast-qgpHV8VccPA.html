counter-strike players as evidenced by
my inbox which has been flooded with at
least three to four emails a week ask me
what kind of rig I'll build to play csgo
with a budget around $500 for the cool
hardware since I don't play Counter
Strike all that much answering this
question accurately was difficult so
I've decided to change that based on
what I found so far it seems like $500
might be overkill for a 1080p gaming rig
the focus is solely on csgo performance
therefore I recommend this build to any
diehard counter-strike players that also
plan on giving some of the more modern
triple-a titles a shot such as Tom
Clancy's the division before we continue
here's the full disclaimer guys this
build guide has been created with a
focus on Australian and US pricing so if
you live in a different region that has
different price ratios then you probably
might not find this build guide
particularly useful also things I throw
under the optional banner include an
optical drive Wi-Fi adapter and
aftermarket cooling additionally this
build focuses exclusively on the core
components or the box and all the bits
inside if you will this means stuff like
the keyboard mouse headset and software
are all extras this stuff is all a
little more personal and you might even
already have it from a previous build
having said that let's dive into the
build starting with the CPU for this
price range I feel the Core i3 is 6100
is by far the best option although this
is only a dual core processor it does
support hyper threading for 4 threads
combine that with the excellent
efficiency of skylake and the relatively
high 3.7 gigahertz operating frequency
and you have a processor that's capable
of taking on the latest games using a
powerful GPU the LGA 1151 processor and
the supporting platform also provide a
nice update path to a more powerful Core
i5 or even Core i7 processor down the
track there's a huge amount of variety
available when it comes to the
motherboard with a reasonably tight
budget we went with an Intel H 110
motherboard as they tend to start at
around 55 us or 85 Oz II there are some
other decent options around the $55 mark
with some of the better examples
including the gigabyte H 110 ma asrock H
110 M HD v RMS IH 110 M Pro D in terms
of features and design all three boards
very similar
really comes down to which offers the
best price at the time if you do plan to
upgrade to a core i5 or better down the
track that we suggest considering
spending almost twice as much on a zeb
170 motherboard such as the msi as f-117
a pro or as our z170a x1 both cost
around $90 this will be a worthwhile
upgrade if you're gonna purchase an
unlocked a processor if you do go with a
cheaper h1 10 motherboard keep in mind
the memory will likely be limited to 20
133 megahertz
there isn't much sense in buying high
clocked memory if it comes at a premium
all three h1 ten motherboards that we
suggested support ddr4 memory we
recommend an 8 gigabyte dual channel kid
pricing starts at around $30 and we
really like the gol Evo Potenza ddr4
2500 eight gigabyte kit for just $29
pricing will no doubt vary but expect to
pay thirty to thirty five US dollars or
forty five to fifty five Australian
dollars now for the all-important
graphics card $500 seems like a decent
chunk of change to play around with the
first that is until you get to the
graphics card at $200 the Radeon r9 380
in geforce gtx 960 quickly going from
mid-range to low-end products
nevertheless they're both very capable
picking between them is no easy task and
frankly you can happily go either way
as I see there's no wrong choice here
ultimately you have to pick one so if
you have a preference that makes life
easier the 4 gigabyte models now cost
pretty much the same as the 2 gigabyte
models so that's a no-brainer the 4
gigabyte 960 and 3/8 is started $190 and
for this build we go with the Radeon r9
380 however before all of you waving a
green flag died for the dislike button
I'll also include the gtx 960 results as
well storages where things get a little
complicated
mostly because it pains me to build any
system without an SSD in order to meet
the budget we've set aside $50 for
storage which buys you a decent 1
terabyte 7200 rpm hard drive or a small
120 gigabyte SSD obviously you can get
both but this will inflate the overall
build cost by up to $50 depending on
which way you go for the hard drive we
recommend the Western Digital blue one
terabyte 7200 rpm model which can be had
for fifty four US dollars of 70
Australian for the SSD the ADA SP 55122
body
really hard to beat it just $35 well the
240 gigabyte model offers an even better
cost per gigabyte ratio of $58 so choose
wisely now for the case and power supply
there's a few options here the most
cost-effective of which is the braid max
EXO which includes a 450 watt PSU for
just forty five US dollars or sixty
Australian granted this case includes a
cheap power supplier but it'll get the
job done and 450 watts is plenty for
this build as you can expect the draw
from the wall to be well under 300 watts
when gaming if you want a fan of this
budget combo than the deep pool
tesseract SW for four u.s. dollars plus
the raid max hybrid 2 RX 530 SS 531
power supply for another 40 dollars is
another excellent wallet-friendly combo
now that we have all that mostly worked
out let's consult the benchmarks the
benchmark and Counter Strike global
Offensive we use the offline bot mode on
the cruise map the benchmark run lasted
60 seconds and the average of three
separate runs was reported there is a
user made benchmark for csgo called FPS
benchmark but I found the results
weren't all that consistent with what I
was finding from single and multiplayer
portions of the game anyway as you can
see the $500 week has no trouble keeping
the frame rate above 100 FPS at 1080p
with all the in game settings cranked up
it is possible to increase the MSAA
level but every other setting was maxed
out it was interesting to find the lowly
r7 370 beating out the gtx 960 in this
title what's more with an average of 151
FPS the 3070 plays just as well as the
380 for this purpose gave me at 1080p it
certainly seems like you could save
quite a bit more money on a rig designed
exclusively for csgo so what if you want
to play other games like say Tom
Clancy's the division while providing
you're happy to use mid-range quality
settings this gaming system is very
capable at 1080p here we see an average
of 65 FPS with a minimum of 51 FPS this
time the r7 370 is a good bit slower
than both the r9 380 and gtx 960
upgrading to the core i5 6600 k off his
little extra performance with the 380
while the upgrade to the 380 ex will net
you a little extra performance if you
want to picky about frame rates the
division can actually be enjoyed using
high quality visual settings here at
$500 rig was good for an average of 49
ft
our frame rates never dip below 38 fps
the I know 380 was again faster than the
GTX 960 and a good bit faster than the
r7 370 meanwhile the three OD X offers a
mild performance bump as just the core
i5 6600 K as I suspected going into this
a $500 budget for a CSTO gaming machine
is a bit overkill you plan to game at
1080p and don't require over 100 frames
per second still if it's a well balanced
and reasonably affordable gaming PC that
you seek let me feel it today there's no
better option the base version of our
build came in at 510 US dollars or 800
Australian dollars which is very good
given the performance you can expect and
the latest triple-a titles adding a 120
gigabyte boot SSD to the mix along with
a separate case and power supply
increases the total cost around 585 u.s.
or 900 Australian dollars again this is
an excellent Buy particularly given it
leaves the door wide open for some very
worthwhile upgrades down the track
upgrades such as the Radeon r9 380 X
which you can expect to pay an
additional 30 US dollars for though
there are some bargains to be had so
keep an eye out for those at the time of
putting this guide together the power
color pcs +3 DX can be had for just 205
dollars on new Wacom if you do plan on
upgrading the CPU in the future then
perhaps consider spending a bit more on
the motherboard Zed 170 boards costing
as little as $90 therefore much better
storage options multi GPU support and
considerably better features for tuning
the memory and CPU also if you're
worried about memory consider getting a
single 8 gigabyte stick as this leaves
the option of battle would add a second
stick down the track for a 16 gigabyte
capacity just to limit you to single
channel memory performance in the
meantime although it's thankfully that
has almost no impact on gaming
performance anyway let me know what you
guys think about this build and if you
have any suggestions please feel free to
leave them in the comments section
I'm your host Matt as always and I'll
see you guys next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
