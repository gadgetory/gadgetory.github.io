keyboards lately including quite a few
the designed to be quick and easy to
take around to a land but I don't think
anything you compete with the mobility
of this little single-handed gaming
keyboard from all rally let's check out
the design first this thing was
specifically designed for League of
Legends players but that's not to say it
doesn't work perfectly well for other
games too it's truly like a cut-down
mechanical gaming keyboard sporting Kyle
blue switches on all 29 keys and
supporting full and key roll over like
any true gaming device we get the
inclusion of RGB backlighting to which
can be controlled software free with the
Escape key in the f keys below the keys
you'll find a nice textured and
contoured wrist rest plus the unmissable
funky silver and triangular space bar on
the right side on the side panels of
this little keyboard is some additional
lighting to that looks pretty damn cool
itself underneath you'll see the
aluminium frame as well as rubber anti
slip pads to jump right into a game you
don't need to install any software
windows will find a driver and install
it straightaway there is a dedicated
software package though that does allow
further customization here you can mess
around with the backlighting further as
well as assign macros and reassigned any
key you want to any function including
media controls in terms of actual use I
thought the t9 plus was pretty cool I
hadn't really use something like this in
the last 10 years or so so felt pretty
strange to do so but the only downside
was that your trash talk is pretty
limited with only 11 letters of the
alphabet at your disposal you kind of
spell new but that aside it was great to
use and I really like the big
comfortable wrist rest overall the t9
plaster more rallies and nifty little
product that brings the best of
mechanical gaming keyboards to a
comeback little device where I could see
this thing being most useful as some
mobile gamers who are generally stuff in
a laptop using this as opposed to the
little chiclet keys on the laptop was
not only much more comfortable but
significantly closer to replicating a
desktop gaming experience and it solves
where I think is one of the biggest
issues with laptop gaming right now you
can grab the old value t 9 plus on
amazon for fifty eight dollars and
ninety-nine cents in USA which may be a
little pricey considering what you can
get some full-sized mechanical keyboards
for but i suppose this is a specialty
item the build quality seems good in the
car switches a fair
proven at this point so i wouldn't
expect people to have any issues with
reliability what do you guys think there
any alternatives from competitors that
I'm missing let me know in the comments
i'm your host man as always and i'll see
you guys next time cheers guys for
