I'm your host Matt and today we're
looking at as rocks new fanless mini-pc
the B box a few months ago Intel
launched their latest Braswell
system-on-chip range they will forgive
you for not noticing it was a pretty
quiet launch and there were no
production units on the shelves until
months after all the details were
released replacing the current Bay Trail
D lineup a 3-cell rod and one Pentium
SOC s all featuring new 14 nanometer air
Montt caused about a month ago as what
released a range of mini ITX
motherboards using these new Braswell
system on chips and they look pretty
good
however the products we have on hand
today is even better
as what called the B box and as a group
to point out it's a PC so not a box to
keep you busy though don't despair it's
actually a pretty cool little PC so far
there are two versions of the B box one
using the star on n 3150 quad core and
then the one we have which is based on
the star on M 3000 a 2.0 a gigahertz
dual-core processor there's three
configurations to choose from the
cheapest of which is a $140 bear bearing
that lets you install your own mSATA SSD
and laptop ddr3 memory and this is the
option we went for for 220 dollars as
Rolf is offering a complete version of
the B box and 3,000 that includes a 128
gigabyte SSD and 4 gigabytes of ddr3
memory which seems like a pretty fair
deal although keep in mind you still
need to bring your own operating system
like an Intel nook it's extremely small
with the capacity of just point 6 liters
and yet as Rockets cram some pretty nice
hardware inside the B box comes in white
black or gold and as you can see we've
picked up the gold version for this
video because what sort of YouTube
salton wouldn't want a tiny gold PC
right but seriously we probably suggest
speaking of the white or black version
for your living room moving on the front
of the B box there are two USB 3 ports
and one of them is a type C port
this makes the B box the first mini PC
to feature type-c USB which apparently
doubles the charge speed of devices such
as smartphones along with the USB 3 port
there's an audio out
it also accepts Markin which is a very
handy feature indeed finally there's a
small infrared receiver used to
communicate with the supplied remote on
top of the B box is a small power button
that's gently backless by a blue LED
around the back we have a 12 volt 3 and
DC input 2 HDMI outputs DisplayPort
output 2 USB 3 ports a single Gigabit
LAN port and a Kensington lock this
provides the B box with considerably
better connectivity than other mini pcs
we've seen underneath the B box there's
four rubberized feet and quite a lot of
insulation to get inside to making the
upgrades or install any hardware you'll
just have to undo these four screws
taking the B box apart reveals a truly
small PC on the back side of the PCB we
find a small yet rather large heat sink
for a mini PC the transfers heat from
the processor to the chassis back on the
top sided PCB we find an M sight alone
mini PCIe slot and 2s o dem slots
it's also worth mentioning at this point
the users can install a two and a half
inch drive into the B box as well which
is very surprising this means you could
install a 2 terabyte drive which is very
handy for users who want to use it as a
home theater PC and store a lot of
movies TV shows or anything like that
obviously an SOC boasting a mere 4 watt
TDP rating isn't gonna set any
performance record so we didn't think it
was worth throwing a whole bunch of
benchmarks at it so we didn't really
think it would reflect the unit's true
usability so instead we're gonna show
you how it performs in the real world
with some general usage applications as
Rob says the B box works so well when
compared to other mini PC is due to its
ability to use dual channel memory where
all other manufacturers are currently
limited to single channel operation it's
worth noting that although we tested
with 16 gigabytes of RAM 4 gigabytes
will probably be fine too since the B
box is really a single tasking device
before we begin keep in mind that we're
using screen capture software running on
the B box to record this video to show
you general usage and that comes at the
cost of around 10 to 20 percent CPU
utilization so the performance Rebeck to
show you is slightly slower than normal
as you can see we're 2013 opens quite
quickly thanks to the SSD so you'll
notice the CPU utilization jumps up to
100% despite the heavy CPU utilization
is ready to go the second the
application pops up and we can scroll
through the document smoothly after
playing around with word we've tried a
few PDF documents they all open quickly
and allow instant browsing of the
document scrolling through the PDF is
smooth for the most part and can be done
quite quickly that we found that running
into a bunch of embedded images was
sometimes caused a bit of lag again note
for the most part the CPU utilization
was locked at 100% next we tried a 1080p
video
a furious review playback was perfectly
smooth when we weren't recording but as
you can see even though we are recording
the screen playback was still smooth
with 29 frames per second that's work
supplied the 4 KB box advertising
trailer to try out and we have to say
playback didn't go well the video would
only playback at a few frames per second
so we don't see how 4k video playback is
really possible finally we tested some
web browsing when compared to a more
powerful core i3 desktop for example the
B box is notably laggy
still non power users which is another
way of saying patient users shouldn't
have any problems again keep in mind
we're recording this footage using the B
box which makes it appear a bit slower
than it really is to recap the B box is
a point six liter mini PC that didn't
consume more than 9 watts during our
testing this incredibly low power usage
allow a dropper to create a completely
fanless tiny little PC honestly I don't
think as were actually be advertising
this model in particular as a 4k player
users that bought it for that purpose
are gonna be on quite the end of a bee
sting because it just can't do it first
of all we can only get 4k to display at
30 Hertz which is extremely laggy even
just moving the mouse around on the
desktop and secondly the B box is only
just capable of playing back 1080p
contents we're really not sure how they
got 4k to work the bare-bones spec is
great value at 140 dollars and we really
appreciate it being able to install an
msi door SSD as well as a two and a half
inch hard drive there's a lot to like
about the B box from the excellent
connectivity to the unbeatable price so
we expect this mini PC to do pretty well
for asrock it'll also be interesting to
see how much faster the star on an 3150
quad-core enabled B boxes we assume as
rock we're referring to this model when
talking about 4k playback despite the
fact that this
typically mentioned it on the n 3000
webpage and the Box overall if you're
looking for a low-powered quiet PC that
you can do emails we're processing web
browsing as well as playback 1080p
content then the B box and 3000 will fit
the bill thanks for watching this mini
review I hope to see you on the next one
this has been Matt for harbor and box
please let me know what you think of the
B box in the comments</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
