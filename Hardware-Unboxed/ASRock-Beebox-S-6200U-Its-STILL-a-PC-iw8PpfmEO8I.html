videos I did a review on the as Rafi box
and much to my delight it was in
bling-bling gold it advertised support
for 4k playback but I found this was
really only under very very specific
conditions so it was a little bit of a
letdown
there was a very affordable unit so I
couldn't complain too much
well now the B box and the little B that
was declaring to the world that it's a
Piercy your back and like Alf better
than ever the new model is called the B
box s and unlike my brand-new Porsche
that I don't have the s actually stands
for skylake and my unit is indeed a much
more appealing black colorway this time
but for those that were loving the pimp
version you can still get in gold silver
or white the B box S is available in two
configurations one featuring a core i3
and then the one I've got here are
featuring the dual core Core i5 6200 you
which I'm expecting to do plenty in this
cool little device there's been other
notable improvements over the previous
feed box and three thousand two and now
supports ddr4 memory USB 3.1 HDMI 2.0
DisplayPort 1.4 there's even a pcie 3.0
x 4 m2 slot both configurations come as
bare bone units and aside from the
built-in CPU you'll be required to find
your own supporting hardware including
memory storage and of course any
accompanying software
aside from the unit itself in the
package you get a remote control the
power adapter a visa bracket and of
course the standard manuals and warranty
documents let's have a quick look around
the device now the enclosure is a glossy
black with rounded edges and at the
front we find an audio jack USB 3.0 port
and USB type-c port which I'm very happy
to see lastly we have the infrared
receiver that pairs the included little
black remote control moving up to the
top of the unit we find some round ended
lines that break another wise plane
design along with subtle power button in
the front left corner that's illuminated
by a blue LED at the back of the B box s
we of course find the main i/o panel and
here there's a DC input not one but two
HDMI ports a DisplayPort output 2 USB 3
ports a Gigabit LAN port and a
Kensington lock there's a little
ventilation here too as well as
underneath the unit where you'll also
find some rubber feet and the screws
that need to be
to access the interior which you'll need
to do to install your selector
components the included core i5 6200 u
processor is a dual core as mentioned
running at 2.3 gigahertz with a turbo
boost frequency of 2.8 gigahertz and a 3
megabyte l3 cache
yes cash Americans sue me you'll also be
getting the relatively unimpressive
Intel HD graphics 5 20s so minesweeper
at least will run flawlessly at 60fps
impressively though the processor is
just a 15 watt part so you can expect
the total system draw the B box s to be
very low as mentioned ddr4 memory is now
supported and with the 2's o DIMM slots
you can cram it up to 32 gigabytes if
you want to though ADA 16 is probably
going to be the typical config for B box
users in terms of storage any two and a
half inch drive can be installed and
then users also have the option for
connecting an nvme m2 SSD with the full
32 gigabit per second bandwidth
available lastly there's an additional
m2 slot though this one features a
pre-installed Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.0
module that supports wireless AC the B
box s scored 2884 points in the PC mark
8 home test which is very respectable
for a mini PC of this caliber in
comparison AMD's desktop a10 7800 apu
was only slightly faster with 2,933
points moving to the creative test we
see that the B box S pulls further ahead
of the original B box and ECS live--i X
when compared to the APU the B box S was
again slightly behind next up we tested
the Microsoft Office performance using
PC market and for this kind of
productivity work the B box s is more
than twice as quick as the original B
box while it isn't a great deal slower
than a fully fledged AMD quad-core apu
the B box s and it's embedded Core i5
6200 u processor managed to outscore the
AMD a10 7800 in the Cinebench r15
multi-threaded test this is surprising
given the apu as a quad core and the
6200 you as a dual core with
hyper-threading
as you can see the 6200 you also
delivered considerably stronger single
thread performance finally the B box has
crushed the original B box along with
the ECS live X 7-zip includes a built in
benchmark that measures compressing and
decompressing performance in MIPS short
for million instructions per second the
dual core processor of the B box s isn't
quite able to keep up with the a10 7800
apu but it does crush what was
previously seen in the original b box
and leave the X the B box s named
APU trade blows in the x264 HD benchmark
the little ass rock mini PC is
particularly impressive here and we see
a massive step forward from the original
B box although not designed for gaming I
know most of you will want to see some
gaming performance regardless so here we
have some League of Legends again that
wouldn't even load on the original B box
or leave it X shockingly the B box s was
quite a bit faster than the a-10 7800 in
this game something I wasn't expecting
to find not just that but an average of
67 FPS for the B box s is particularly
impressive given we're playing at 1080p
using the very high quality settings
those wanting to play csgo in the living
room can do so on the B box s though if
you play in the game at 1080p be
prepared to lower the quality settings
we received a 60 FPS average using the
medium quality settings so that was very
playable it would have been amazing if
the hugely popular overwatch played well
in the B box s but sadly it wasn't the
case yes an average of 49 FPS can be
seen here which casual gamers should
find acceptable however the issue being
that we had to reduce the quality
settings to the lowest possible value
and then lower the render scale to 50%
at 1080p the game looked pretty horrible
but I guess it was playable given the
performance just seen the idle
consumption of just 9 watts is extremely
impressive in comparison the AMD a10
7800 system consumed 28 watts so that
was three times more compared to the
original B box we're seeing a little
over twice the power consumption when
stressing just the CPU with 22 watts for
the B box s still that's roughly four
and a half times less than the a10 7800
with the GPU and CPU under full load the
B box s consumed just 39 watts a very
impressive result given the performance
the B box s seems like a solid step
forward it makes many improvements over
the original B box before it the move to
implement a low voltage skylight
processor has proven to be a significant
upgrade in terms of performance and
where the solar on end 3000 lacks punch
the i5 6200 you bring some serious
performance to this tiny unit another
benefit of this processor is that it
provides truly capable 4k playback we
had no problems playing back all types
of 4k content and this was really a
requirement for this compact computer
that many of we wanting to use as the
home theater PC making it even more
suited to this use was not just the
inclusion of HDMI 1.4 but also hdmi 2.0
and DisplayPort enabling 4k 60 Hertz
playback as well as support for dual
monitors your space
point one is another awesome inclusion
there were only a couple of small issues
I found with the device it is a little
tricky to get your saddle cables to fit
properly when you have a two and a half
hitch drive installed and there's some
definite cramming required some users
will also find the glossy surface to be
a bit of a fingerprint magnet but if
that kind of thing doesn't bother you
then there's no issue for potential
buyers the real selling point of the be
box s is the price you might expect ask
I like you enable core i5 mini PC it
cost a pretty penny especially one of
this caliber a no idea which is why the
current 320 US dollar asking price over
at Newegg really shocked me the 6100 you
model is also selling for just two
hundred sixty four dollars another
amazing bargain right there
unfortunately for now the B box test is
yet to go on sale down under so I can't
quote Ozzy pricing still given what
we've seen stateside there's a good
chance they'll be competitively priced
in ozland as well so in the end this is
a really cool and really small mini PCE
that would be perfect as a portable if
you needed to be home theater PC for
casual gaming and 4k playback what do
