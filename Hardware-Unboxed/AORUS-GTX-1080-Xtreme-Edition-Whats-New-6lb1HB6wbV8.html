like Brian from check yes hey welcome
back to harbor unboxed today I have a
graphics card review for you and the
focus of this review will be the new
horas GTX Extreme Edition leading up to
the release of the GTX 980 last year
gigabyte like many of Nvidia's blog
partners we're cashing in on the hype
gigabyte began by teasing their extreme
model which is this guy here and to this
day this remains one of the biggest and
most exciting gtx eternity graphics
cards gamers can hope to lay their hands
on out of all the 1080 graphics cards
i've seen today gigabytes extreme gaming
is still one of my favorite and with the
included higher bandwidth sli bridge in
the Premium Pack sticking to of these
monsters together and a single system
looks pretty special recently however
I've heard rumors that gigabyte were
playing to release an even more extreme
1080 under their horas branding well
those reports were accurate and we now
have the Auris GTX 1080 extreme edition
as it stands the gigabyte branding has
been dropped entirely from the product
name and replaced with horas so that's
interesting for comparison though I do
still have the GTX Today extreme gaming
model on hand and that'll make it a bit
easier to work out what's new or
different about the extreme edition
model extreme gaming extreme Edition I
know it's a bit confusing it's not just
the names that are similar either you'd
be forgiven for mistake in these
graphics cards as being the same there
are however a number of subtle
differences some of them are quite
important as well as a few noteworthy
upgrades as much as I liked the original
model it did have a few issues and not
all of them are caused by the graphics
card itself two started a huge number of
consumers who bought the original
extreme gaming complained about their
graphics card arriving damaged with bent
or squashed fins being a big problem as
well as broken fans the aluminium fan
shroud was quite limiting with the
graphics card weighing so much this made
picking it up quite difficult this was a
problem because the fans overlapped any
small alignment issue here that they
would hit each other the damaged
heatsink fins were caused in transit the
packaging simply couldn't safely
accommodate this massive graphics card
so it seems gigabyte has decided on a
do-over and they've taken
opportunity to rebrand their graphics
card as an horas product but how they
learned from the few mistakes they made
with the extreme gaming and now that
with this extreme edition well let's go
find out actually before I take a closer
look please note this won't be a
detailed benchmark review in terms of
framerate performance we aren't
expecting anything new the idea behind
this product at least as far as I can
tell is to improve the design quality
and durability of the graphics card the
thermals are also meant to be improved
so this is what my testing will be
focused on right away things are looking
good the package might be significantly
smaller but inside we find a big bulky
graphics card supported by cardboard
chalks within an anti-static bag the bag
is also held in place by an external
cardboard brace as well popping the card
out of the packaging we saw no evidence
of any kind of damage a few fins were
slightly unaligned but nothing was
squashed beyond repair I have to admit
at first I thought wow this is exactly
the same graphics card in different
packaging with a new logo however after
a week side-by-side comparison it became
clear the updates went beyond that the
new fan shroud is even larger and now
does a better job of protecting the fans
the LED strip lighting on top also looks
much more impressive as well flipping
the graphics card over we find a very
different design for this Oris model the
full-length backplate has been upgraded
to feature a copper finned insert along
with an LED backlit Oris logo gigabyte
claims that the advanced tourist cooling
backplate reduces the GPU load
temperature by 3 degrees by removing
built-up heat on the backside of the PCB
the copper plate features a 6 thermal
pad on the underside which helps
transfer heat away from the PCB the
plate then features small raised fins
which help dissipate heat by maximizing
the surface area there are also a few
summer pads found on the backplate which
remove built-up heat from the VRMs so
this time around gigabyte is are really
looking to maximize the cooling
potential of this massive graphics card
by covering every heat source in thermal
pads so then that covers all the new
stuff but for those that aren't familiar
with the original model here's a quick
look at the rest of the features this
card has to offer gigabytes windforce 3x
cooling design is being used and this
employs three huge 100 millimeter fans
impressively though this doesn't stretch
the graphics card beyond 300 millimeters
as you might expect three fans of this
size to do in fact it's just 208
nine millimeters long gigabyte is
achieve this space-saving feat by
overlapping the fans
normally this would create a lot of
turbulence which could reduce cooling
performance and more importantly
generate quite a bit more noise this has
been circumvented though by using a
counter rotating center fan gigabyte
says this provides up to 10 percent more
airflow than conventional triple fan
coolers the fans themselves feature
double ball bearings to ensure the
extreme addition goes the distance the
3d active fan feature enables silent
semi passive fans allowing gamers to
enjoy game playing absolute silence when
the system is under light load an LED
fans stop indicator provides a
user-friendly instant display on the fan
status adding a bit of bling to this
cooler is of course RGB lighting the LED
powered X illuminates the center of the
fan shroud while another LED powered
Oris logo and brand name can be found on
the side and this creates an awesome
effects for those with case windows as
mentioned earlier there is also a large
LED logo on the back plate as well so
gigabytes RGB game is on point here
removing the cooler reveals a massive
copper base that covers not just the GPU
but also the gddr5 X memory chips
there's also six very long six
millimeter thick copper heat pipes
making their way through two large
arrays of aluminium fins now that we
have access to the PCB what we find here
is a completely reworked masterpiece
that measures two hundred and
sixty-seven millimeters long and 121
millimeters tall gigabyte is employed at
12 plus 2 power phases on which when
compared to the n video reference design
should allow the extreme edition to work
at much lower temperatures and provide
more stable voltage output both of which
should improve overclocking and extend
the life of the card gigabyte also
claims to be using tight next grade
chokes and capacitors for greater
durability another cool feature is the
aerospace-grade PCB coding which
gigabyte claims protects the graphics
card and all of its available components
from dust insects drop screws drill
shavings and abrasion probably more
useful though are the moisture resistant
properties which are designed to stop
the card from short-circuiting or
failing if you happen to have a water
leak and water happens to drip onto the
backside of the card or the front side
if it's in an inverted case anyway the
card is also backed by the extreme care
four year warranty although it's not
entirely clear if the warranty card
water damage moving on we find dual
eight pin PCI Express power connectors
capable of feeding the graphics card up
to 300 watts that's twice the PCI power
input of the founders Edition card
finally end of the PCB there are two
internal HDMI connectors which connect
to the extreme VR link module that said
unlike the extreme gaming model the
extreme edition doesn't appear to come
in a premium pack which also includes
the VR link module so this would have to
be purchased separately those of you
wanting to overclock the gtx 1080
extreme edition can turn to the horas
engine software which works very well
the software enables easy overclocking
and allows a user to increase the
thermal target as well as the power
target the user can monitor the GPUs
vitals and easy overclocking modes exist
along with the more complex manual
overclocking options voltage states can
also be adjusted and custom fan curves
can also be created finally the
all-important RGB lighting can also be
configured here and there are a few more
standard effects to play with there is
an OC mode which can be enabled a click
of a button and this boosts the base
clock to 1784 megahertz resulting in a
boost clock speed of at least 1936
megahertz I skipped that step though I
went straight in for the kill with some
custom overclocking the call was able to
accept the same eighteen hundred and
thirty nine megahertz frequencies I
managed with the extreme gaming version
and this should see the boost clock
speed stay at or above 1978 megahertz
the gddr5 X memory also hit a frequency
of 1382 megahertz for a transfer speed
of eleven thousand and fifty eight
gigabits per second of course due to the
way in videos GPU boost 3.0 works we
know that the card can run faster than
the suggested boost clock is kept under
the thermal and power targets in the
case of the Extreme Edition this allowed
the card to hold an operating frequency
of 2.1 gigahertz after a 20-minute
stress test which was most impressive
please note i'm only testing the extreme
edition with my custom overclock out of
the box it's identical to the extreme
gaming in terms of framerate performance
even with the max overclock a polite if
perform is very much like the extreme
gaming gaining at just a single frame in
our Far Cry primal test the Extreme
Edition matches the extreme gaming in
the doom benchmark with 77 FPS on
average so not much else to say here
really again we find the maximum
overclock on the extreme edition match
as well I was able to cheat with the
extreme
meaning this time when testing ARMA 3
here we see the Extreme Edition consumes
roughly the same amount of power as the
extreme gaming in its out-of-the-box
configuration as well as overclocked
finally I took a look at the operating
temperatures and here I again found
results that were much the same as the
original extreme gaming model using the
auto fan speed profile the extreme
edition reach 69 degrees under full load
which was actually a single degree
higher than extreme gaming that said we
are within the margin of error here
without the overclocked attempt so much
the same the fans just weren't spinning
as hard
that said at no point were the fans on
the extreme edition audible even when
overclocked to the max it was virtually
silent therefore I decided to manually
turn them up to 60% at this setting they
were still very quiet but I could now
distinguish the graphics card from the
case fans when sitting a few feet from
the system so while still very quiet
load temps drop down with 63 degrees
which is very impressive looking purely
at the results there immediately isn't
that much to see the Auris GTX 10-8
Extreme Edition looks to be the extreme
gaming with a slightly different name
and well for the most part that's kind
of true that's it it really comes down
to the fine details what we're looking
at here is a version 2.0 if you will a
more refined extreme gaming gigabyte has
listened to consumers identified the
weaknesses of the original version and
address them with this Oris model given
how much I liked the original model I
was always going to be a fan of this
enhanced version and well I am the new
fan shroud protects the fans better and
manages to look even tougher the copper
inset on the back also looks nice as
does the LED backlit logo in fact the
LED lighting overall is much improved
but I really appreciate how gigabyte
hasn't just taken the opportunity to
make the extreme version more flashy all
those extra thermal pads are very
welcomed the only issue left to address
now is the price and it's kind of a big
one gigabyte are offering base model gtx
1080s using their wind force coolers for
just 580 dollars u.s. right now while
the extreme gaming models that such as
this guy here
670 US and that's a pretty huge price
premium rumor has it that the extreme
Edition that I have right here will be
$700 u.s. and while a very nice graphics
card that's a 20 something percent price
premium
so it might be a bit hard for
enthusiasts to swallow that really is my
only criticism of this new graphics card
other than that I love the Auris GT X
1080 extreme edition and I desperately
want to see another one of these in my
test system for some SLI action I really
don't think it gets much tougher than
that
anyway let me know what you guys think
about the new horas GT X 1080 extreme
edition is that something you'll
consider for your next build I'm your
host Steve and I hope to catch on
another video really soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
