are you paying attention I'm doing the
intro I bring the questions how I do it
again will just continue on today is the
March QA is that the month we're in do
you just have to check you should know
come on smart yeah today is your 26th
this video will probably go in the 27th
anyway it's the March QA so it is time
for Tim and I to address your questions
and for those of you who asked Wendell
where where are these questions where I
get to ask my questions because we seem
to get a lot of those every single month
we do ask on the community tab generally
a few days before you'll see this video
so pay attention to the community tab
you should be notified by YouTube but if
not maybe you have to click the alarm
bell does that work I don't know who
knows you just a hopeless we usually put
it on Twitter as well so after you
follow us over there you'll definitely
be notified or you can become a patreon
member because then you get a special
question asking a session anyway we
should probably just get on with it okay
I'll start with the first question why
not as good first question is while the
1080i and 2080 perform relatively
similar in current titles could the 1080
- I actually outlive the 2080 because it
increased vrm we do get that question
quite a bit or they both be at the stage
where they were at the beginning to
underperform before they reach the vram
limitation so I think basically the core
of this question is will the larger
veeram of the 1080i which is 11
gigabytes give it an advantage over the
a gigabyte vrm buffer of the 2080 in the
future it's hard to say really because
we need to get to a point in time where
games actually use more than 8 gigabytes
of vram quite regularly that will
introduce stuttering and issues with the
20/80 that won't be visible with the
1080 Ti
I don't think that will happen now I
think what we'll probably see is what we
often see and it's not the gimping that
people claim Nvidia do they just won't
be optimizing for the Pascal
architecture as much as they will be for
churring and that will give cheering a
performance bump and I think
also see future titles taking advantage
of the cheering architecture much more
which will give the 2080 a bigger
performance bump over the taillight
we've seen like I think up to 20% in
some titles yeah yeah so that's that's
really at once I don't think it'll
happen okay here we go
is it worth upgrading from a gtx 1066
gigabyte to an ITX 2060 or a gtx 1660 TI
i my gut would say no it really depends
on what you're wanting to do like an
arch x26 you might be useful if you want
to get up to 1440p gaming it's got a bit
more room rather I think it is 53%
faster an average I've got a few notes
here 53 percent faster on average and it
is 40% higher MSRP so that's the
suggested price and that's generally
what they hit shortly after release so
you're getting if you look at it that
way you're getting a small performance
boost but it still is outright quite a
bit faster and then over the 1660 ti
it's 34 the 1660 ti is 34% faster than
the 1060 a 12% higher MSRP so it's a
good value there I mean sort of if
you've already paid $250 for a 1060 over
the last few years do you really want to
go and then spend another two hundred
and twenty dollars - or sorry two
hundred eighty dollars for the 1660 TOI
to get a 34% bump again as you say I
think it depends - you set up it really
depends on your setup and how desperate
your after-action performance really
yeah really I don't think there's the
architects 2060 is probably the best
replacement yeah but yeah it's 54
percent faster so if you're willing to
spend
well that's $350 to get a fifty four
percent performance bump which I suppose
is pretty reasonable not again it
depends on how long ago you bought the
10 C so you know it's kind of factors so
yeah that's the best information I can
give you is that it's 53 percent faster
or 34 percent for the 1660 TI you have
to work out if it's worth investing that
money to get those performance bumps is
really what it boils down to okay next
question here and I've definitely made a
few notes for this one because I'm not
that up to speed on this sort of stuff I
mean
well it's not something we cover
regularly on the channel so the question
is is it true that PS use perform their
most efficient at 60% load and they're
really really short answer to that is
yes that is true
so around it's probably even a little
bit lower for most units around 50% load
they are seeing maximum efficiency so
that doesn't necessarily mean you want
to double the amount of output well you
don't want to double the output of the
unit because say you think you might use
throw nawat it doesn't necessarily mean
you need to get a 600 watt unit though
that is a pretty good rule to follow it
really depends on the actual efficiency
of the unit and that's where the 80 plus
certification is very handy because
basically anything that's 80 plus
certified well they've been certified by
an independent a third-party so that
really should be so if they're not if
they're not certified to anything the
efficiency curve can be all over the
place so a hundred percent load they
could be woefully inefficient but they
could be very efficient at 50 percents
of the curve could drop off quite
significantly I've got some notes here
you guys can look this up but the 80
plus certification save the gold
standard for example
it must be 88% efficient and a hundred
percent so that's very good so when
you're using the full capacity of the
unit you're still seeing very high
efficiency there and then and this is
when plugged into a 230 volt grid which
is what we have here in Australia it
must also be 92% efficient at 50% and
that 88% efficient at 20% load so your
efficient efficiency you can actually
drop off quite a bit at lower levels as
well it's not just at 100% so that's
also something to be aware of and yeah
generally as I said there was a rule of
thumb probably double what you think
you're gonna need it just makes it a bit
easier and really I had a look at the
corsair CX series and there's not a huge
difference in price there I see a lot of
people sort of saying why would I bother
with the 750 unit if my system is only
using throne or watts and miles will
just get you know a little extra
Headroom and get the 450 watt unit or
whatever and it's fair enough I suppose
but it's not a big cost like I'm saying
it's $55 for the 5500
sorry the 550 watt model and it's like
$15 more get you the 750 watt model so I
would recommend always spending that $15
for the 750 watt model because for
upgrades and yep stuff like that it just
gives you a lot more Headroom so yeah I
think that pretty much answers that
question but yeah as I said in short yes
okay
question here from scatter vault
recently Nvidia chose not to size down
their current 12 nanometer manufacturing
process to 7 nanometers unlike AMD since
there is no need to innovate due to
their current dominance GPU performance
over AMD will this be a good or bad move
when Navi drops will they have to play
catch-up or will there be no need to
I'll start with this one then so the
first part of that question I would say
the situation that wasn't the exact
situation let's say so six months ago
when in-video was looking to release the
art x-series as they did they really
didn't have any other options it was the
TSM see 12 nanometer process or nothing
they would just have to wait until 7
nanometre got to a point where they
could us you know handle the supply that
the GeForce r-tx series would demand and
that's not even really a possible it's
not possible now really so it'd be a few
more months mid sort of 2019 yeah we're
not talking about like a low volume
Radeon 7 which I'm significant volume of
GPUs yes yeah just wasn't quite ready so
yeah so basically the first part that
question it was the 12 nanometer process
or nothing 7 enemies wasn't an option
and yeah so that really had sort of the
opportunity to either as you're saying
sort of delay and wait yeah for 12 yards
until 7 animator becomes ready or just
go with what they had available to them
but we are sorry interrupt I was going
to say but it escaped me for a moment I
read an article a while I believe they
were meant to go or they were hoping to
go with a samsung process yes eh yeah
okay sorry I'll let you continue okay
I'm catching it with Tim okay it's fine
because I think as you say that was sort
of the
and they were hoping that samsung's
next-generation processing that would be
ready by the time that they needed to
get their true products that just wasn't
so potentially if that's what they'll be
going with with the next generation
product line that could be next year as
well what was the second part of that
question and will this be good or will
this be a good or bad move when when
Navi drops I mean and videos a lot far
ahead in terms of their architecture
yeah estimate about 1/2 generations it
seems yeah I mean I own seven matches
the 1080 TI seven enemies versus 60
nanometers yeah so if you're talking
about that sort of jump you know aimed
it moves it to a new architecture and
seven nanometers they're probably
assuming that's only reasonable
improvements they might only be matching
chewing on 12 nanometer in which case
then it's hard to say obviously it's all
yet to be seen yeah but based on what we
do know at the moment it's not really a
problem for in-video yeah they're
they're in the lead so they said all the
all the moves at the moment I think yep
next question this is a little out of my
error of knowledge but could aim to
create a rise in CP with onboard HBM so
high bandwidth memory and people always
talk about how rise in needs memory
balance and it seems that creating a cpu
with some form of high speed memory on
the processor could increase performance
I'm not even sure if that's possible I'm
just wondering thanks okay now it's a
good question and it's something that's
already happened pretty much in your
world of reviewing things yeah I mean
there was that Intel CPU that had the
intel core and then the the AMD Vega GP
which had hpm attached to it look it's
very it's a complicated question because
on the CPU front a CPU already has cash
in it so from that sense you already get
that performance advantages to adding
HBM on there as well you sort of then
create an extra tier of you know memory
to deal with you've got then your cache
HBM and then your I'm assuming would
still be a large so you're talking about
if they're integrated into the one die
yeah well it seems this question was
about
quit their penalizing CPU CPU with
onboard HP I'll talk about ApS in a
moment but right I've been a CPU itself
I think that sounds fairly complicated
and expensive
just because yeah you're creating that
extra T that you have to deal with with
the AP use sorry you are on oh yeah more
as an APU question yeah but the AP users
still were talking about because for the
AP use the memory bandwidth is key for
the GPU side of the APU so yeah I would
think that if they did include onboard
hbm you would get a pretty significant
performance increase the problem then is
that ap used especially on a desktop
tend to be a lower-cost
product yes you add HBM that's probably
gonna double the cost of something like
a 2200 G easily double it and then for
similar situation for the laptops so I
think Intel for their next generation
laptop CPUs when they've they're gonna
do the journal Evan graphics they're
planning to use much faster memory
speeds for their laptop rocks I think
that thinking of like ddr4 3000 as a
standard so when you start talking about
that then you get much higher bandwidth
which helps them with their supposedly
much beefier GPU design so I think HBM
is probably not the solution that makes
a lot of sense but certainly faster
memory of other kinds like just
increasing the spec would help yet from
a performance standpoint it's very
possible and it's ideal really you
basically getting all the benefits of a
discrete GPU there in fact it's even
better in a lot of regards but it
doesn't make sense in terms of cost to
justify it you'd need a much more
powerful integrated graphics solution
and then you've just got to deal with
heat or that's a lot of heat on one
package to deal with it's basically
essentially it's cramming your discrete
graphics card and your CPU together so
yeah it's like putting an RT X 2080 and
a 1900 K together good luck with that
one
right he's interesting question that
we've got so I want your opinion on this
we all know
AMD should improve their marketing so to
help with mine share with AMD benefit
from having their Radeon Rison and Navi
logos on the boot screen of the PS 5 for
example yeah I suggested this on Amy's
main Twitter page you could cost
- nothing to pull off on console gamers
may be more willing to buy an MD PC - so
this is would be a good idea because it
would be it would be but I don't think
it's possible so hey it would be a good
idea because obviously it's marketing
for them right yeah it's a very popular
product their logos right that would be
beneficial to them but the way that
AMD's semi-custom division works which
is the division the division that
produces the chips for companies like
the PS but so knit with the PS 5 it's
not really it doesn't really become an
Ambu product after that point it's only
buying their chips from them AMD is just
doing the the building process yeah so
Sony at that point then has full control
over what they do with their chip so
it's not a situation where Sony is
buying an AMD off-the-shelf product that
they then put in it's a partnership
between the two companies and with the
ps4 for example it was only until very
late in that console cycle the Sony even
begun to consider talking about the fact
that only Hardware was inside yeah in
fact when you when you question AMD
about what was inside the ps4 they just
wouldn't tell you about it because it
was Sony's decision to tell you so I
think that's where they're going to be a
bit hamstrung with that sort of idea
sure I'd be great for them to market it
but Sony wants it to be a Sony product I
want you to see ps4 or PS 5 logos when
you boot it have to be a different
agreement so there have to be some
benefit and family would they sacrifice
say make the chips cheaper to get their
logos on the on the screen I'm not sure
that's in their best interest in the
moment so so yeah it's not free
advertising basically it would cost them
yeah that'd have to be some trade-off in
the way that this sort of semi custom
stuff works ok next question here do you
think the PC game will move to AP use
like console we get this question quite
a bit I'm not sure we've addressed it in
this series but in short no or at least
not anytime soon actually it was the
second part of that question as well and
if so will it need ddr5 well ddr fibers
won't be relevant because it's not gonna
be happening anytime soon
so yeah and that ties into a
the HBM question we sort of did earlier
so ap use definitely need more memory
bandwidth to improve the graphics
performance that's definitely the
limiting factor at the moment ddr5 will
certainly help with that and it may make
entry level GPUs irrelevant though entry
level GPUs will do some a bit faster to
become relevant and so that kind of
takes care of itself there but yeah I
think I would just summarize that one by
saying not anytime soon you got anything
else to add to that no I mean pretty
much is just the GPUs of people buying
for PC gaming and far too large and
powerful to put to an AP package at the
moment so yeah ok first time I asked you
here huh nice glad to get your question
I've noticed through monitoring software
like cam that motherboards have many
temperature sensors and some display
unusually high readings usually three or
four sensors displaying temps in the
hundred and ten to 120 degrees Celsius
range is this anything to be worried
about or is this normal
I think what you're saying it's pretty
common we see that a lot with hardware
info as long as it's not your CPU
temperature and even then there might be
a few different CPU temperature readout
so you want to find which one is the
right one that happens in hardware info
some have offsets and whatnot but if
it's usually there vrm senses or
motherboard that just labelled
motherboard or something like that I see
that quite often there's about three or
four of those if you're really concerned
about it take the side of your case off
check your vrm heat sinks maybe with an
IR gun if you have one of those to avoid
toasty fingers otherwise you can just
tap on them and see if they're warm if
they're quite cool to touch I mean if
you can hold the heatsink you know you
put that okay you're okay if it's extra
if it's extremely uncomfortable to hold
and the systems at idle and there may be
a problem there and if it's burning hot
then there's definitely a problem but
more often than not it's just a false
reading either the sensors aren't
calibrated correctly and like I said
there's some sort of offset there not
accounting for or sometimes the sensors
aren't actually there and the software
is reading what it thinks as the sensor
it's just reading like a maximum value
so yeah usually it's really not
something to worry about but like I said
if you're concerned
you can do a touch test and see how hot
things are getting next question real
cause versus threads in gaming ok 8
cause 16 threads versus 16 cause 16
threads now I'm not sure if ultra toast
is asking for a benchmark I'm not yeah I
need a bit more context with this
question or this this thing that you're
putting forth but since we can't bench
market right now on the spot I'm just
going to assume that you're asking which
one is just better for gaming
well it's quite obviously the 16 cause
16 threads because they're physical
cause so SMT technology doesn't give you
a 100% performance boost per core there
any way it could be as good as if that
was the case 25 to maybe 50% and some of
the better examples when the software is
really well optimized to take advantage
of that so yeah it's what does that get
you to like a 12 core processor or
something so yeah if they're of the same
architecture clearly 16 cores is the way
to go yeah that's that one that's really
don't need to benchmark that one to
answer it so yeah you're always better
off with logical cause so like a 9700 K
will be better than any of the quad
cores with hyper-threading 4 as another
example okay next question time to buy
Ram again with low prices
yay just as Steve predicted what a
legend right then moving on from that
nonsense how important is it for RAM to
be qvl for the motherboard so it's
basically certified for the motherboard
quality cheston for the board and the
Oratory 19 pro Wi-Fi doesn't have the
Corsair Vengeance and then you'll put
the question up on the screen I don't
have to read that out generally speaking
it's not super important not super
crucial it's very rare that you will run
into memory compatibility issues
especially with a mature platform so
your chances with an Intel platform
almost non-existent
and we're talking about a 390 board here
so you can pretty much stick any modern
ddr4 memory on that and be guaranteed it
was booed up first time no worries
Verizon memory support not quite as good
especially if the gen one stuff it has
improved significantly for Gen 2 so less
of a concern now so really I wouldn't
worry about it too much but if you're a
new builder or you just can't afford to
have any issues or you don't have other
memory to diagnose if it is the memory
that's a problem that can be a real
issue for guys that don't have parts
laying all over the place then yeah just
buy a stuff that's definitely certified
to work on that board and you can
usually eliminate that as being an issue
for why the things not turning on for
you when you're finished building it
they can be a real pain in the backside
Etha nod to that Tim nope that's all
good muster nailed it then moving on ok
next question here I'm gonna jump
straight on this because I want Tim to
answer it should we wait for Navi and
Rison third gen for benefits and whatnot
Tim it's always impossible to say isn't
it it is yeah it's kind of like saying
well was the g-force r-tx stuff worth it
I think the GTX cheering stuff was but
you know if you had a GTX 1080 was it
worth waiting for the RT X 2080 and well
yeah you guys can answer that but I
don't think it would have been no less
you had an older sort of Maxwell or
older but it could have been a situation
where the ITX cards offered 20 30
percent more performance for the same
price and that would be worth going up a
tier I think if you have a swell Japan
yet should we wait again what are you
coming from if it's a second gen rising
processor then well you I don't know
like yeah well you you were not going to
upgrade one generation so it's a hard
one to answer if you have like a really
really old you know Intel Sandy Bridge
Ivy Bridge maybe even has well quad core
then upgrading to like an 8 core Xen 2
CPU may very well be worth waiting for
rather than going for a well it's not
really worth upgrading to a rise in
second gen CPU anyway so I guess you
just got a look at the benefits of
upgrading now
a net you much extra performance you
guys always give me these hard questions
that have too many ways of answering and
then I just mumble on and timber sits
there and falls asleep I wake him up the
next question okay here's another
interesting do you guys think something
maybe something something question do
you guys think Nvidia will release more
churring GPU similar to RTX 20 80 20 80
i without I suppose the arty stuff and
the tensor cause like they did with the
GTX 60 and 60 T I haven't really put
much thought into this but I would say
no ya know if they're not gonna make a
GP that's equivalent to an ITX GP but
just without the RT calls that yeah
doesn't seem like something they'll do
they'll keep pushing down the stack yes
no cheaper and cheaper products but I
know it takes like a gtx 28 II can't see
that happening no the RT X is their
premium stuff they're going to push it
no matter what and I mean they've got to
set the stage at some point for ray
tracing and all that they want to be the
leaders in that so this is just a
branding thing they're setting up now I
tried to push it pretty heavily
ray-tracing hasn't panned out to be
nearly as exciting and its initial
implementation as we'd hoped it would be
but it will no doubt be pretty special
in years to come so yeah I think Tim and
I are on the same page on that one no
yep alright I'll ask this question as
well because I'm going to sit back and
let Tim answer it because with monitors
with some freesync monitors now working
on NVIDIA GPUs I think you've done a few
videos about that will it cut aimed ease
profit significantly mmm since one of
the advantage of AMD are back then it
was it's cheaper freesync monitors
compared to in videos g-sync misers it's
an it's an interesting one because on
face valued say I mean it might because
people were buying AMD GPUs for free
sync compared to NVIDIA GPUs weighing up
that value proposition that's true on
the other hand though it seems like most
people will still buy whatever GPU
offered the best value in terms of its
performance as opposed to fit factoring
and all the other features that they
came with it so where that was you know
your GTX 1060 OVR
580 or whatever it was mostly about
price versus performance without really
factoring in freesync - for the am
because despite all the comments we used
to get about not doing that yes I was a
heavily push thing so I'd say that
because of that I don't think it will
actually cut into AMD's profit
significantly I think the very issues
right now or more that their GPU
architecture seems to be struggling
competitive in video so I think they
will need to do something bare as
opposed to worrying about whether Nvidia
cards run free sync or not even even now
like or even back when you couldn't use
a free sync monitor with an Nvidia card
it was still my opinion that it was
worth just buying free sync monitor for
you Nvidia card anyway yeah
simply because higher refresh rates at
lower prices just made a better value
overall so yeah that's kind of that's
kind of my answer to that one I like the
V code system is now available to all
it's definitely the right move for Envia
to open up but family making their
profit yeah time for them to Thompson
for them to up their game when their
GPUs performance wise and that's where
they'll see their profits come back now
the Mauritian 40 my one app guys wake me
up when it's done now you get sick of
these more questions for whatever reason
a high quality of boomer Rick asks a
high-quality TN panels that bad like a
4k one with 350 near brightness and
decent 1,001 contrast the blazing fast
response time surely help against it
difficult quickly it's a difficult one
to answer because TN yeah I mean are
they bad it depends what you're looking
for if you're if you're a content
creator which is why I assume a lot of
people are buying 4k monitor for then I
would say that TN really isn't good
enough for content creation their
viewing angles in particular are not
good enough you know you there's very I
don't think there's any for KT ends that
can do wide color gamut for example so
from that perspective you know if you're
buying 4k no not I don't think the best
are good enough but if you're gaming
again no blazing fast response times
could be something that you're
interested in tans have the highest
refresh rate still and as
if you get a high call you want and I've
got a vo-tech one that's over there
that's the 1440p wide gamut one that's
the best TN I've ever seen
it certainly is perfectly fine for
gaming it's a very good quality pal
so again depends on use cases okay
boomer excite you've got another
question here with the massive gains
that even a Sandy Bridge partner gets
from overclocking is it worth it for
someone that just plays games and
browses the internet to upgrade if they
have a maxed out Xen 77 rig for example
like a 3770k at over 4.6 gigahertz and
2400 c11 Ram CL 1130 3770k overclock
that's still a pretty basely CPU that's
not every bridge part you'd mainly
probably wanna upgrade from that if you
wanted newer platform features you know
m dot 2 ports and all that sort of stuff
but for gaming and browsing that's still
plenty fine really
I shouldn't have any issues there I
haven't done a revisit recently I know
haswell's still a bit of a beastly
platform until I sit made too many
improvements since then they've just
added more cores really but yeah it's
really up to you to judge if it's doing
what you want it to do then yeah gain
bottlenecks then should be ok yeah it
should be fine but based on I've still
got it I've got a 2600 K and I've got a
3770k system and they both work really
well the the Sandy Bridge systems
starting to age a bit as long as you've
got a core i7 model that's not too bad
the core i5s hurting a bit these days
I'll probably do a revisit of that soon
but yeah should be fine ok there's part
one went very smoothly
hopefully part 2 will go just as
smoothly and you'll be able to see that
on the channel tomorrow if you liked the
video you know what to do you can
subscribe for more content we do the Q&amp;amp;A
once a month so you can probably
subscribe for more than just that and
you can follow us on patreon as I
mentioned at the start a video because
you can get access to our discord chat
Timur myself often there chatting away
with you guys and we do a monthly live
stream which we just filmed a few hours
ago that was a bit of fun and yeah so
I'm your host Dave I'm your host Tim
we'll see you again next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
