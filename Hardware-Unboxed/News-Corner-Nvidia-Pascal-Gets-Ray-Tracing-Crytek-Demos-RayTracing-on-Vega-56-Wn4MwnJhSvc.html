corner no celebrations this week but
there has been a bunch of news to come
out of both the Game Developers
Conference and envious GTC including
news that Nvidia is bringing ray-tracing
to Pascal cards a new Intel graphics
control panel more epic games exclusives
and a few of interesting topics so let's
get into it we'll start with the story
of Nvidia bringing DirectX ray-tracing
to Pascal because this is an interesting
one that's been generating a bit of
discussion in terms of what is happening
this is a fairly straightforward story
if you have either a GeForce 10 or
GeForce 16 series GPU in April you'll be
able to download a driver that we let
you run DXR effects on your gtx card so
talking about dicks are reflections in
battlefield 5 ray-traced global
illumination in Metro Exodus and the new
DX our shadow implementation in shadow
of the Tomb Raider plus any future DXR
games you won't be able to run rate
racing on every Pascal card Nvidia is
restricting the feature to owners of the
gtx 1066 gigabyte and up plus both
current GTX cheering models the GTX 1660
and GTX 1660 Ti as well as the Volta
based Titan v4 the few people on one of
those however you won't be feature
restricted in video slides says these
cards will only be good for basic arty
effects but I think this is more
referring to performance as all of the
supported cards will be able to at least
enable all of the various DXR effects of
course the big question here is
performance it's hard to say exactly how
fast Pascal GPUs will be at rate racing
but the expectation is that the cards
will be very slow nvidia officially says
there are TX GPUs are two to three times
faster rate racing but this gap could
widen depending on the rate racing
workload especially in games that have
intensive DXi implementations NVIDIA
slides also suggests that there will be
a performance difference between Pascal
and GTX tearing cards
Pascal cards can only run rate racing on
the standard FP 32 CUDA cores
whereas cheering can take advantage of
concurrent in 32 processing to speed up
the process somewhat gtx turing will
we'll be anywhere near as fast as a GPU
that has proper RT cores but it should
be a step above Pascal consume that when
you enable ray tracing on an art xgp you
in the games released so far you
typically get a twenty-five to fifty
percent drop in framerate Pascal GPUs
will likely be completely useless for
ray tracing I think we'll see Pascal
cards running at one third or maybe even
one quarter of the framerate with ray
tracing enabled even on something as
powerful as a Titan XP with even Nvidia
expecting Pascal to struggle with heavy
rate tracing effects this begs the
question of why NVIDIA would enable this
functionality one reason is for
developers not all game devs have access
to RTX hardware but still might want to
work on ray tracing effects for gamers
that do a developer could easily test
out these effects at low frame rates
without spending big on our TX which
could help with the adoption of our TX
tech the other angle is potentially
about marketing Nvidia enabling ray
tracing your Pascal could be an
incentive to get users to upgrade to a
new Turing our TX GPU if they see the
effect running extremely poor you on
that Pascal card with an RT X graphics
card a nice easy solution to that
performance problem Nvidia might get a
few extra sales it will also help
demonstrate to the doubters that yes
arti cause actually are necessary to run
right tracing in the games we have at
the moment I have seen a few comments
saying that with ray tracing coming to
Pascal this max our TX cards unnecessary
but I really don't think this is the
case if you're interested in ray tracing
our DX card should still be orders of
magnitude faster and we'll just have to
wait and see how that goes when the
driver becomes available in April we
thought that said Crytek has
demonstrated that you don't need an RT X
GPU to run their latest implementation
of real time ray tracing in their Newton
nyan nyan demo the demo shows how real
time mesh ray-traced reflections and
refractions can deliver highly realistic
visuals for games
this effect is part of a new total
illumination engine that's set to come
in CryEngine 5.5 later this year this
demo has certainly caused a lot of
discussion and undoubtedly is very
impressive especially as it runs at a 4k
resolution at 30fps on a mere value 56
not one of invidious r-tx cards with
hardware ray tracing acceleration some
people have been jumping up and
suggesting this makes in videos RTX
cards completely unnecessary but really
I don't think that's the case even
though I've personally been a bit of a
critic of r-tx since its launch there's
many things to consider here firstly
ray-tracing has always been possible on
other GPUs it's not magically restricted
to RTX GPUs as nvidia has shown by
opening it up to pascal cards the
question has always been about
performance and it seems Crytek have
uncovered a technique to lower the
computational requirements of real time
ray tracing enough so that runs on a GPU
like Vega 56 secondly this demo is
showing off just real time ray-traced
reflections there's no information to
suggest this technique can accelerate
other ray-traced effects like global
illumination or shadows cryogens total
illumination uses s bo g for global
illumination rather than traditional ray
tracing for example SVG is a high
quality effect but it's not the same as
ray-traced global illumination in Metro
Exodus this is also just a tech demo
there have been many times we've seen
extremely impressive demos running well
on modest GPUs only to spend years
waiting for that Tecna materialize all
who discovered that in real world game
implementations it's not quite as
impressive and doesn't run as well
hopefully this tech will smoothly
transition into actual games but loads
certainly who wouldn't guarantee it and
finally cards with dedicated ray tracing
hardware will always have an advantage
when it comes to accelerating ray
tracing
if this demo can be run at 4k 30fps on
value 56 it should run significantly
faster on a card like an RT X 2070 with
Nvidia saying they fully expect to
accelerate this sort of technology this
technique will help bring ray tracing to
many more mainstream game this but it
sounds like there will still be a
significant advantage to dedicated arty
cards at the high end we'll just have to
see how this one plays out
intel has overhauled their graphics
control panel through a new version
they're calling the graphics command
center all of you guys probably haven't
spent too much time in the Intel
graphics control panel if you've got a
discrete AMD or nvidia GPU in your
system but anyone that has used the old
version will tell you that it was a bit
lackluster to say the least this new
graphics command center has a modern
design that's more in line with AMD's
Radeon settings in terms of style
more explanations as to what items do
and in general is just a better design
that's built around being user-friendly
intel has also begun the process of
offering one-click game optimization
another feature that is found in control
panels from other GPU vendors perhaps
the biggest change is how you get the
graphics command center rather than
being bundled with the driver download
instead the utility is distributed
through the Microsoft on Windows 10 as a
UWP app this allows you to receive
automatic updates and it will receive
these updates separate to regular driver
updates which could come in handy as
features get rolled out at different
times to drive optimizations the new
control utility works with Intel 6th gen
skylax CPUs and newer though this really
is just to set the foundation for
intel's upcoming discrete GPUs that are
set for launch in the coming years after
all if Intel wants to compete with the
big boys in the GPU market it will need
a competitive platform and that includes
a decent driver utility and associated
software Microsoft has standardized
variable rate shading into the DirectX
12 API this feature first made a major
appearance as part of invidious truing
architecture and it seems like a really
neat way to improve performance in games
rather than shading the entire frame at
a constant rate variable rate shading
allows the GPU to focus more GPU
resources on shading important areas of
the scene with the greatest level of
detail while using lower shading rates
for less important areas an example of
again that uses variable rate shading
today is Wolfenstein 2 Microsoft is
dividing hardware support for variable
rate shading into two tiers tier one
which encompasses most dx12 capable GPUs
and tier two which is for GPUs that
fully support variable rate shading so
tier two GPUs right now are essentially
just chewing GPUs from Nvidia with
Intel's general Evan GPU designed to
also support the feature tier 1 GPUs can
still use variable rate shady but it can
only do so between separate draw calls
whereas tier two GPUs can vary the
shading rate within the frame the tier 1
technique does come at a small visual
quality loss but improves performance by
around 20% in one demonstration while
the better tea to implementation sees no
loss to visuals for a 14% increase to
performance hopefully through
integrating this technology into DirectX
12 it will encourage more developers to
use it in their game
because it seems like a really neat way
to improve performance without affecting
visuals too much much to the annoyance
of all the epic game store haters out
there a bunch of new games are coming
exclusively to the epic games store over
the next year or so headlining the
offerings is obsidians upcoming the
outer worlds which admittedly will also
be on the Microsoft although it won't be
on Steam another upcoming one year epic
store exclusive is control from remedy
which I believe is also an RT X title
then on top of that Quantic Dream's are
also bringing some of their previously
PlayStation exclusive tiles to PC but as
epic game store exclusives the games in
question are heavy rain beyond two souls
and Detroit become human pretty neither
these games are headed to PC for the
first time for that exclusivity deal
it's probably going to annoy a lot of
people Epic Games did say that
eventually they will stop negotiating
exclusives but for the time being that
seems to be their clear plan to
establish themselves in the market it'll
be interesting to see if steam plants
any responses to this onslaught of
exclusives with epic also giving
developers a better cut of the revenue
so far they've just complained about it
without making any real changes so we'll
see if that changes anytime soon HP has
new laptops that use AMD's rise in
mobile 3000 series ap use in what is a
shocking development one of the few
companies to make rise in mobile laptops
using the previous generation of
products HP has launched a new envy
x-360 15 that offers either the Rison 5
3500 U or the rise in 7 3702 in addition
to standard ultra portable hardware the
new Envy x-360 15 is also available in
an Intel version with either the core i5
80 to 65 U or the core i7 85 65 u the
Intel models are about $70 more
expensive with the AMD model starting at
$800 which keeps this laptop in that
nice mid-range bracket I'm hoping your
test sunrise in 3,000 laptops soon to
see how the refreshed APU stack up with
other mobile offerings that's it for
