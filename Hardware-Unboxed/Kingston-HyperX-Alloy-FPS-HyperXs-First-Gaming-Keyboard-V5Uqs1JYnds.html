month that I was unfortunately unable to
attend due to the arcs for ID deadline
so I was pretty bummed to miss out
thankfully they were kind enough to send
me a sample of the debutante product
anyway so here we are I've got on hand
hi praxis first gaming keyboard the
HyperX alloy fps I'm a big fan of the
gaming headsets HyperX are produced and
some of you know I'm practically
swimming in mechanical keyboards lately
so I've been very curious to see what
HyperX have tried to do here that's
different what's going to separate the
gaming keyboard from the swath of
competition let's take a closer look and
find out the first thing you'll notice
about the alloy is that it's a compact
keyboard that really doesn't waste any
deaf space hi perhaps have gone for a
compact minimalist design and footprint
however you'll notice this isn't a ten
keyless keyboard this means those that
are chasing ultimate tests space-saving
will probably look on to an even smaller
option it measures in a four hundred and
forty two millimeters wide and one
hundred and twenty nine millimeters deep
so it's about as small as a keyboard
could be while still maintaining
basically a standard layout users such
as myself who enjoy wrist rest will be
left wanting here as the name suggests
it's supposed to suit FPS gamers and I
suppose that's in the way that allows
more room for your mouse to move around
beyond that there aren't really any FPS
suited features you'll find no dedicated
macros of course and no dedicated media
buttons either but we do get a few of
the standard functions found on the F
keys activated by the function key the
backplate behind the keys is aluminium
and all the finishings around the
keyboard seemed tired so it gives a
reasonably high quality feel overall the
other advantage of the cut-down overall
footprint is Portability and this seems
to have been a focus for the alloy fps
in the package you get a cool branded
HyperX carry bag to protect your goods
and the 1.8 made a braided USB cable
actually disconnects entirely from the
keyboard to help ensure it's not damaged
during transit also included in your
package is a key cap removal tool and
some sexy red custom key caps these look
pretty cool into textures so that's a
nice inclusion by HyperX thankfully they
stick to the standard shape too I can't
stand the custom key caps that are oddly
shaped
another good inclusion is USB
pass-through which is labeled as a phone
charging port on the L a fps and it's
located in the stem
in a back right corner of the keyboard
the backlighting is fairly bright and
all red on this model right now the
HyperX alloy fps only comes equipped
with cherry MX blue switches which i've
got no issue with it all these little
loudest and clicky us to the Cherry MX
range so if you're in an office with
others or typing in a room where someone
sleeps and they might don't be very
happy with you here's a quick typing
test so you can hear the switches so
overall there's nothing really
mind-blowing about the l fps and while
that isn't entirely surprising it would
have been nice to see a little more
creativity from Kingston still I do like
the little extras that come in the box
and overall it's a high-quality package
it'll certainly be reliable and perform
well the alloy fps is a brand new
product so we might see pricing drop a
little over time but for me right now
it's far too expensive what it is there
are many other keyboards with richer
feature sets such as the g.skill km 780
that are available for the same or less
money right now the LOA fps were running
162 dollars a 10 wave in australia and
that's the best price i could find at
the time in this review this was the
same starting price as the rocket swara
however and in that head-to-head I have
to give the knowledge to the alloy fps
somehow this thing is available in
Australia before the USA so I'm still
not sure about pricing in the US but
I'll update the Amazon link when it's
available for purchase over there how do
you guys think the LA fps looks let me
know in the comments I'm your host Matt
