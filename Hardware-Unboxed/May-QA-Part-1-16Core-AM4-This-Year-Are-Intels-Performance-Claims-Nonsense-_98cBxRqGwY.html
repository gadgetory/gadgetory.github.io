making it possible for Tim and myself to
attend Computex
2019 please check out their latest AMD
x5 70 motherboards made for gamers and
creators by the link in the video
description also thank you to Corsair
for their support please check all their
exciting products out via the link in
the video description welcome back to
harbor unboxed for the May QA which
we're doing from Computex so to be a
little more casual than usual though the
Q&amp;amp;A segments are pretty nice casual
pretty casual but we're just doing this
from my hotel rooms hopefully the audio
is fine
hopefully the Lighting's okay you're not
really here to look at us it's more
about hearing our answers to some of
your questions so we should probably get
into those and start answering them we
reckon Tim yep sounds good to me cool
first question the thing that got you
most excited about for competition what
was the most exciting thing and it's not
really it's not even the most exciting
product what was the most exciting thing
at Computex magma has to be the Zen to
sea view announcement surely that was
the most exciting thing yeah yeah so
basically that was even before Computex
kicked off that was we're all pretty
interested to see what AMD had to say
there was some talks that it might just
be like a chipset announcement and then
some like further
teasers further Zen to staff and Navi
that would have really sucked I would
have been massively letdown because I
was expecting them to do pretty much
what they did I was hoping for that
anyway so that was great to see see that
was probably the most exciting thing
it's always exciting at the showroom
floor and run around there's no real one
product that stuck out like seeing all
the the full range of X 570 motherboards
from seuss msi gigabyte asrock all those
guys that was that was a lot of fun
there's always cool cases coolers
monitors power supplies pretty much
everything so yeah yeah I agree cool ok
next one here can you send Tim to the
gym
he's a bit small to lift those large
monitor safely yeah don't don't
underestimate him he's a mighty little
unit
but now you can move those been one of
the boxes ok
super easy around especially after all
this Computex work carrying a camera and
I think I'm doing all right it's quite
funny to the showroom floor Tim's been
carrying his big camera rig and it's got
a gimbal and everything on it that
weighs and your camera alone in your
lense weighs twice as much as mine so
it's quite funny I've got my little
church fire with my little lens on it
then Tim's got this huge heavy rig that
he has to lug around well I just cruise
around quite comfortably so he's been
getting plenty of workouts here at
Computex just a quick one here I'll
address this because I've already
covered this in my initial third-gen
Rison video my announcement video any
guess about pricing for the 3600 and
3600 X so there the risin 5 processes
that weren't mentioned in the live
stream oddly but then were sort of
revealed afterwards and put on their
website so the pricing for the 3600 is
$200 us and the 3600 X is 250 dollars
u.s. so that information was included in
my video covering the the keynote but
there you have it
do you think we'll get 16 core on a.m.
for this year will it be a response to
something Intel I managed to pull out so
tell us to him what's gonna happen
ah because I'm some Oracle Am I he's
crystal ball out well first of all let's
preface this by saying we don't know we
don't know what aim these plans are for
16 core CPUs so all of what I'm about to
say is a guess so let's just say that so
when you sort of look at the lineup and
and what aim DS done in terms of
positioning and announcing and sort of
their naming scheme giving the 12 core
part part rise in 930 900 x branding it
seems unlikely that they would push a 16
core part into that lineup for this
generation it would make sense for AMD
to sort of keep that 16 core part for a
future generation so you rise in 4000
series simply because let's just say
that it's a situation like with Zen -
Zen plus and we get Zen - - Zen 2 plus
or then 3 ends up just being basically
then 2 plus then you know em you might
only be left with a few percent IPC
improvements they might be able to get a
few hundred megahertz out of you know in
terms of clocking at higher like they
were able to with Rison -
so then what else exciting stuff could
they possibly give and one obvious
option there is to give you a sixteen
called then because they can go oh yeah
we've got a little bit of IPC a little
bit of clock speed but wait we've also
got a new 16 core part that we're
introducing and that would sort of you
know bring a lot of hype to that next
generation by keeping that in the bag
for next year so if I had to guess
that's probably what they'll end up
doing I'd be surprised I wouldn't be
surprised but it would be a little
strange for aimed it has like a 39 50 X
or something as the 16 core part because
those two parts would be pretty
similarly named yeah and very squashed
up the top and you think if they were
planning is 16 core for this generation
that they would maybe have pushed all
the products down like that have the
instead of a was it 3,700 X and 3,800 X
having a thirty seven hundred and thirty
700 X and then the twelve core could be
the the 3800 X moving that living that
3900 X slot for sort of your 16 core
part yeah so when you sort of look at
all those things it does point more
towards you know aimed at waiting for
the next gen to release that CPU
obviously there's been all those leaks
for engineering samples that sort of say
that you know it's possible to have that
chip that I'm sure they've got them
working but that isn't necessarily
indication that it's coming now yeah I
think that's where a bit of confusion
comes into it because when we say we
don't think there's a 16 put core part
coming now people get up in arms and say
but there is a 16 core part of how we
not aware of this and they can clearly
do one but yep we get they can do one
it's just does it make sense to do one
now and yeah it's really all about
market conditions what which is what Tim
and I've been saying since I don't know
these rumors surfaced yeah they'll have
it in their back pocket if they need to
use it sooner than they would like to
they will otherwise yeah it might be
something they save for the yeah what
would it be there's n 2 plus series I
think yeah exactly I mean it could again
depend on say Intel might do something
crazy the interview I can't can't see
that personally have now so let's say
they come out with some ridiculous CPU
on their mainstream desktop line and
then aimed he could respond with the 16
core so from a strategy perspective for
them it makes a lot of sense to keep
that in the bag as opposed to just
blasting everything out right now yeah
and again as we said it's it's what the
market yeah shouting out to me and Intel
pushing out a ten core part we expect
them to do that don't we
I think yeah we probably probably and
it's going to be another 14 and I mean a
plus plus type deal I think for a lot of
workloads it'll end up being slower than
the 99 oh okay yeah so but it's not
gonna rival a 12 cause in two parts so
it doesn't really put AMD in a position
where they have to push the 16 crap
because Intel's gone and tacked on
another two cores to the 19 on her okay
yeah I think I'd be fairly confident
saying that if there is a 16 core part
for this Rison 3000 series that will
definitely see it after thread Ripper
because it would make it would make the
most sense for AMD to produce a 16 core
part with Xen to capabilities on thread
Ripper first to sort of you know
establish that lineup up to 32 cores or
whatever they are not doing there and
then later they can introduce 16 core to
the mainstream because if they introduce
16 core now and then release afterwards
a 16 core thread Ripper CPU they're kind
of it would be useful for some yeah sure
that CP was kind of going out to die so
yeah I think that's probably my thoughts
on this all yeah I have 16 core thing
yeah fully growth everything you said
there I was wondering if you guys could
simulate the rx 5700 by overclocking
Vegas 64 liquid-cooled to the limit if
needed and making it 10 percent faster
than the r-tx 2070 in strange brigade
and then test the Vega in other games
and compare it to other video cards okay
I sort of see where you're going with
that one and it would probably give you
a rough idea but it wouldn't really be
accurate it's it's a whole new
architecture I mean obviously it'll lend
well actually no it's meant to be
designed from the ground up like lexan
was so is it yeah it's been to be a
whole new architecture so yeah GCN's
compute heavy
well they said in their keynote where
they've done the same thing they did
with risin we're risin they're just
fresh use clean slate and so that's what
our DNA's meant to be okay
how true that is I don't know we haven't
seen it we don't know
basically you can't really simulate a
different architecture so we could we
could simulate the rise and five
processes with the rise in seven
processes because you just disable a few
cause it's the same architecture it's
the same CPU that's essentially what AMD
is doing anyway so you can accurately
simulate that you just have to try and
roughly match the clock speeds but when
we're talking about a completely
different architecture that has improved
efficiency and who knows what else we
haven't like I said we haven't seen it
yet we haven't really seen any solid
specifications it might give you a rough
idea but yeah they'll it's kind of well
I guess you could look at it simulating
chewing performance with the Pascal GPU
it doesn't really work yeah next
question here do you think the new AMD
rise in CPU 37 rx will come with a box
cooler will you reckon to him well I
actually looked this up right before the
we're answering the question jobs I
wanted to know whether ami released the
information it turns out they have the
rise in seven and rise in nine CPU so
that's your eight cores and your 12 core
processors they all come with the
Wraiths prism apparently according to
AMD's website it's good cool and then
for the rise in five CPUs it's I believe
they're 3,600 X that's the higher
clocked model that comes with the race
spire and then the lower clocked model
comes with the Wraith Stealth's I
believe that's the 3600 so yeah that's
the cooler situation with the the rise
ins 3000 series as far as the chips
they've released so far so yeah next
question could you do a collab with
Jared from Jared's tech that would be
really exciting to watch we can probably
do that actually if we were to do that
it would probably look something like
this good a job would you like to do a
club yeah all right we'll make that
happen
cool all right I've got Tim back I'm
clapping with Tim now yeah we will you
be doing testing it with the mitigations
enabled when you start benchmarking for
Verizon 3000 so I'm assuming they're
talking about the well the Intel
vulnerabilities so it's on B load for
example we basically test with the
latest security stuff enabled so only if
it's enabled by default though so we
won't go and enable them too
deliberately crippled Intel if that
stuff hasn't been enabled yet for
whatever reason maybe there's things
they've still got to sort out so we'll
test with the latest version of Windows
and the latest motherboard BIOS update
so whatever that enables that's how
we'll test I'll obviously let you guys
know if it does enable certain
mitigations if if it's new to what we've
been testing about the previous like
spectrum meltdown stuff we've been
testing with that enabled ever since it
was enabled by default so if it's not
enabled by default by the time we go to
test Rison then so be I mean guys will
have the conspiracies like Intel delayed
and motherboard manufacturers pushing
them out till after rise and so Intel
didn't take a hit then if that happens
it happens it just means I'll retest
once they come out I mean there's
nothing else I can do about it really I
can't go and apply them if they never
get rolled out in the way that we think
they're going to so that's that one more
questions coming up here this one's on
na'vi na'vi seems to have some
unexpected things such as the rDNA and
such but with them comparing to a 2070
is there any hope na'vi having better
than 20 80 / 10 ATT eye level card in
other words a cheaper and or better than
vega 7 not implying Vega is better than
28 what do I say first of all we've got
to test it to see where we're at but I
like the direction that AMD is taking
with the rDNA architecture separating
that from their compute heavy products I
think that's definitely something
they've needed to do for a long time I
think it's yeah definitely step in the
right direction what it means for this
first release hard to say well we'll
test it and see I'm not I'm not going to
jump to any conclusions after we see the
performance I think they're taking
things in the right direction I think
down the track it will be massively
beneficial so I think it's a way for AMD
to make it come back
got a tonight at Tim know you guys want
to touch that one okay next question
what's been the most Wow item you've
seen a Computex so far that's not a
motherboard case or AMD
any hidden gems well I'm gonna I'm gonna
pop since I read that question
pass that off to Tim so I can have a
quick thing okay well I was just quickly
thinking cuz I was like I bet Steve's
gonna pass this one are ya think we go
um look I mean as a monitor kind of guy
you know that's not included in that
list of things true so I can mention
it's a loophole for you how good I can't
mention the Seuss mini LED monitor I
think it's probably not the most
exciting product for a lot of people but
to get better HD our support even though
it's gonna be really ridiculously
expensive again it just excites me
because H jars been great on TVs and to
have more monitors that can do it well
is something that I look out for and
probably as well I'm not I'm not sure
what you're gonna say but if you do say
this then I've stolen it from you and
then knocked your passive cooler I was
going to say that but it's alright I'll
think of something else yeah so that
which we haven't really covered on the
channel too much but the ability to
passively cool in 9900 K with this big
beast thing hmm that was pretty cool
that was no pun intended
okay well storage we've been talking
about like the storage the gigabyte Oris
had their m2 a quad expansion card that
you can raid with you know raid zero
does like 15 gigabytes per second that's
kind of on my wish list now so you know
that was really exciting and a bit of it
was also a bit of a hidden gem I didn't
expect to see that coming so that was
that was really cool it's also an
awesome feature of the x5 70 platform
because that's what you need to use it
yeah every saw a lot of good cases the
I'm also back to Knox were also there
d15 successor that looks pretty cool yes
yeah I mean no not true they will
probably take a fair while to come out
but yeah their work yeah certainly very
cool I also quite liked no no who's
probably controversial but the team
group RGB SSD is ridiculous is RGB SSDs
are if you're getting one that one looks
by far the best of any on the market I
agree the wow factor with that thing's
pretty incredible at yeah it's an old
rinky-dinky solder SSD but it does look
impressive yes I kind of one of those
aesthetic things like they had the
liquid called end not to drive as well
which is like yeah what's that going to
provide cooling wise but at least four
builds and you want to make a
cool-looking build it's for sure
yeah it sure builds for sure you
triggered another thought with me of
liquid cooling I really liked of course
as hydro x range so the GPU blocks them
look really cool all the connectors and
stuff so yeah I mean I'm I'm pretty keen
to I think it's been sent my way so just
play around with that and their their
CPU blocks looks good as well so yeah
some cool stuff there from Corsair yeah
it's probably a whole heap of other
things but that's all that's coming to
mind right now we'll move on to the next
question
alright now the question here from our
good mates al Kagan in artists called
chat our Intel's performance claims as
nonsense as they seem on the surface so
he's yeah I'll let you start with this
one Tim yeah I mean we we haven't talked
a lot about the Intel announcements in
the show because it's kind of more at
least at this stage a laptop type thing
you're sort of looking at ice like or
whatever they're calling it um so I
guess the main things that people are
concerned about is looking at the slides
that they provide about the IPC
improvements I think Intel was quoting
up to 18% for ice or sunny Cove compared
to Skyway that came out of nowhere so
that was kind of like ah that's would be
interesting but I think what stars
referring to is it looked like in the
fine print of that slide that Intel
weren't running these security patches
that are required for the latest
skylight processes so you know I believe
that would include not just the latest
stuff but also the previous meltdown
specter so they weren't running any of
that to get those gains so were they
running the security patterns obviously
we don't know all the fine details and
Tim and I haven't really covered this
too closely as Tim said but were they
running those security patches on the
older system Oh comparing it to I'm not
sure so it's not clear because there's
like we've seen there's quite a
substantial performance difference
between that so if all systems were
tested in the same way that story that
mean too much it's still an apples to
apples test but yeah it's a bit funny
that they would specify that they're not
using their current mitigations that's
weird
yeah I found that weird as well the
other thing that I found slightly
strange was sort of they had this chart
that showed the performance of the
laptop CPUs of skylake through two KB
like refresh through
whiskey Lake through to their latest
generation stuff on 10 animators and the
performance difference between whiskey
lake and the new ice lake paths in their
charts wasn't that large and it
certainly wasn't 18% so I guess the
initial thing is that obviously the
clock speeds look like they're going to
be lower with the new ice lake part you
know it looks like we're going down from
say you're mid 4 gigahertz to below 4
gigahertz for the maximum turbo free
okay which might have something to do
with that I wasn't will have to maybe
put up that shot on the screen or
something cuz I wasn't sure whether it
was entire CPU performance or just
single threaded or just IPC there cuz I
PNC doesn't really if you're changing
the clock speed anyway yes but that
chart looked not as impressive as that
18 percent gain because I don't know if
you increase the IPC then you down clock
it then you're really not going to be
getting much so yeah this is possibly
something we look into a bit more
closely when we get back if there's
interest in that but it seems like it's
a bit of marketing silliness on that one
yeah I mean Intel's trying to make it
sound impressive let go of his IPC games
but if they can't clock it as I intend
animators then it's a bit of a moot
point and we're not games so but again
this isn't going to apply to the desktop
parts for quite some time it doesn't
sound like that CPU core architecture is
going to be ready for high-performance
CPU
I mean laptop arts I guess a high
performance but I mean like in 95 watt
desktop parts for quite some time so
yeah it's still a lot to play out there
but to me like even though if those
performance games on the CPU might not
sound as impressive as they look on the
surface the GPU improvements still look
pretty decent I mean we're coming from a
really terrible integrated graphics to
something that is at least going on
Intel's marketing slightly better than
the rise in AP use on 10 nanometers it's
not like they're blowing everything out
of the water by Intel that is a big step
forward it's if we compare Intel to
Intel I think what you're saying is it's
really impressive yeah for them so yeah
so but if you ignore all other current
solutions integrated solutions yeah
probably not as impressive so I'll be
interested to test that out and see what
they've done all right next question
here I think this might be similar to a
question we've already ants
but we'll give it a go anyway given the
stated TDPS of these n2 chips
why does it seem like so many of the x5
70 motherboards look a massively over
built from the veer in perspective
almost all the ones I saw showcased at
Computex look to be boards that will
start four and $200 and we're not going
to get be 550 until next year something
seems off well I wouldn't say anything
seems off to me in the themes seems
pretty good we've sort of talked about
why the board's well actually we haven't
talked about that we've talked about
people thinking that the CPUs are
power-hungry because of the big beefy
VRMs which aren't necessarily necessary
obviously people are wanting to build in
Headroom because they're all expecting a
16 called pile at some point it's
definitely happening at some point we
just don't know whether it's next month
later in the year early next year
whatever the case may be there are it's
really it's a really really good sign so
something's definitely not off it's the
complete opposite to something being off
it's a it's it's a sign that people are
taking AMD seriously namely motherboard
vendors the motherboard vendors that we
spoke to said that they're now seeing
their AMD boards heavily out selling
their Intel boards which I was shocked
by yeah I heard one or two people say
that to us so hopefully that
informations well I don't really care if
it's correct or not but it's a sign that
rise ins getting good crap good traction
we know that for current sales rising is
selling well so that being the case
they're willing to invest more into the
boards make the board's better because
they're expecting to sell large volumes
of them so yeah that's certainly good
news that's certainly good news for AMD
to that no not really and I mean making
a massively overbuilt vrm is only going
to mean better vrm performance it'll run
cooler so even if it ends up being
completely unnecessary for the chips
that are actually on this platform yeah
you just end up getting better
performance and potentially you know if
you want to do a massive 16 core all
core overclock that the board is going
to be capable and not running close to
the the limits of what that board can do
but still has Headroom for
or you know thermals and all that sort
of thing so the board runs well
absolutely it's great to see so many
high quality X 570 boards because you
look at the B 450 boards off the top of
my head with that if there's any been
any newer ones released when I first did
my roundup it was like a mess I had the
tomahawk and the carbon Pro there mortar
M ATX board was pretty good but other
than that the other board makers kind of
dropped the ball there there vrm and
Cooling was pretty crap the X 470 range
was pretty crap as well like the
flagship boards from a gigabyte and a
soos were good but beyond that the
cheaper boards weren't very good you
just get B 450 instead so you really had
to be careful about which board you
bought especially if you wanted to
overclock or yeah upgrade CPUs down the
track whereas with x5 70 is from what
I've seen and that's sort of what you're
commenting they look to be like the
cheapest boards around $200 but they're
all good
as you know corner-cutting crappy boards
like they all seem really really good
gigabytes range looks amazing MSI had
some great boards we didn't get to look
at the asou spawns in too much detail in
terms of the vrm design I think they're
still going with their twin phase Yale
which we're not particularly sold on one
way or the other but none of their
boards are bad that's for sure there are
really good boards and they're going to
handle the 16 core part if and when that
comes out in the rise and 3000 series
anyway so that's that one okay so that
concludes part 1 of this month's QA that
you're probably watching in the next
month by the time we edit this and we'll
probably be on a plane and while you
guys are watching this self we're not
replying to any or addressing any of the
comments in the comment section it's
probably because we're on the 10-hour
flight back to Melbourne anyway thank
you for watching like subscribe share
sharing a thing I think we we should
encourage people to share not sure
people actually do it okay guys please
share we need show team um you might
enjoy it I don't know she into tech
stuff anyway that is definitely going to
do it for this one you can also support
us on patreon if you want to do that but
anyway thanks for the great questions
and hopefully we can get part 2 edited
before we have to leave
so I'm your host Steve I'm your host Tim
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
