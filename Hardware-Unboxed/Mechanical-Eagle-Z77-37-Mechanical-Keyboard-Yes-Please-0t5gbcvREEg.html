gear all the time so when my new friend
from Chinese brand grande Vella reached
out to me to review a couple of their
products I figured why not today I'm
taking a look at the new 40 US dollar
mechanical keyboard called the
mechanical Eagles at 77 first let's take
a look at the design of this thing
obviously it's a 10 Kahless board and
there aren't any additional macro keys
or midi keys on the keyboard there is
however a function key and wealth of
additional functions that can be found
on the F keys as well as lighting
settings under the number keys and on
insert home and end windows lock is also
available and you can increase the
brightness of all of the back lights
with the arrow keys the function keys
all worked for me with no additional
software or driver installation and the
lighting controls worked the same way
I'm not sure if it was necessary to have
a different lighting setting for each
number key and honestly I couldn't
figure out what some of them did but I
guess they do a decent job of giving you
customization without the hassle of
installing software the function on the
insert key seems to be the best totally
through a range of cool lighting effects
now I bet up to this point you thought
this might have been an RGB keyboard and
I don't blame you I felt that too but
then I realized it's actually a
multicolored keyboard instead each room
has a different colored backlight giving
a rainbow effect from top to bottom so
if you'd like to have all of your back
lights and uniform you're out of luck
here rather than try and explain all of
the lighting effects available I'm gonna
show you guys what they look like
now the build of the keyboard actually
feels quite good the backplate is made
from a solid feeling aluminium with a
curved Ridge at the front and the Eagle
logo at the top the overall look is
really simple but I think the key caps
take away from this a little they used
an unusual font which looks pretty good
but that'll be subjective what makes it
look clutter however is the secondary
functions especially along the number
row and for me this made the keyboard
look a little confusing and yeah
cluttered as I said the underside is all
one piece and it's made from plastic
with two wing emblems included there's
two flip-down rubberized feet attached
and two small rubber pads at the front
so standard stuff here the switches on
the model I receive with blue switches
and it clearly copies of the Cherry MX
blues they gave the same loud click you
feedback and as a fan of the Cherry MX
blue is actually family it's really
great to use I can't comment on the
reliability over time obviously but as
far as I can tell they seem good I was
also impressed with the low amount of
key wobble on the keyboard too for those
that like a sound test this is what they
sounded like overall I was actually
surprisingly impressed by this budget
mechanical keyboard to be honest I
didn't expect big things coming from a
Chinese brand that I'd never heard of
and with the price tag being so low I
mentioned this was a budget keyboard
remember well you're probably wondering
how budget I'm talking on Amazon you can
pick this baby up for just $39 and 59
cents making it far and away the
cheapest mechanical keyboard I've ever
used
sure it is a 10k
this keyboard and you have to be happy
with having rainbow back lights but I
honestly found this a delight to type on
them for those that want copies of other
cherry MX's it also comes in black brown
red and purple switches according to the
box there's a lot of functions available
by default too and it was nice not
having to install any software to use
them all
oh yeah and 87k anti-ghosting n key
rollover is supported to the wall up
I've got to say this offers the best
value pure typing experience I've ever
come across if your budget is tight and
you want to just have that mechanical
keyboard feel and feedback then this
thing could be the go for under 40 US
dollars I can't really bring myself to
complain about almost anything and even
without back lining it would have been a
good price unfortunately I couldn't find
anywhere to buy this in Australia maybe
I'll have to import some do you guys
