corner I decided to take a few days off
this week but I couldn't leave you guys
with hot news corner on Friday so I'm
back to tackle some of the biggest news
topics including the resignation of
Intel CEO and new NVIDIA GPU you
definitely shouldn't get excited about
and plenty of other interesting story so
let's get right into it the first story
came as a bit of a surprise when I was
browsing the internet last night Intel
CEO Brian krzanich has resigned
effective immediately due to having a
past consensual relationship with an
Intel employee this sort of behavior is
against Intel's code of conduct which
prevents relationships between an
employee and their direct subordinate
apparently the relationship ended a
while ago but Intel was only made aware
of it recently Cruz NH has resigned from
both the CEO position and the Board of
Directors CFO Robert Swan has stepped up
to be an interim CEO
while the company explores a replacement
it does seem like this resignation has
come at short notices Intel doesn't have
any replacements lined up at the moment
however the search for a new CEO has
begun with Intel looking at both
internal and external candidates Cruz
Energy's tenure as CEO has seen Intel
continually post record profits and
strong growth however some criticize his
leadership throughout recent issues
including Intel struggles with 10
nanometer fabrication and the whole
specter and meltdown fiasco it will
definitely be interesting to see where
Intel goes on a new leadership and it
could be a refreshing change for a
company that is facing increased
competition Nvidia also pulled a
surprise move this week unveiling the
Titan V CEO edition CEO Jensen Wang
revealed this new Titan vsq
at the computer vision and pattern
recognition conference and proceeded to
give away 20 units right there the Titan
V CEO Edition is a limited edition GPU
and right now it's not a retail product
so there's no price no launch date no
official specification sheet and no
formal announcement it probably will
become a limited-time retail product in
the future at some ludicrous price but
right now the only units appear to be
those given away at this launch anyway
the cool thing about the Titan vceo
edition
it's vram increased to 32 gig of HBM -
this means nvidia is using 8 high stacks
the same used on their 32 gig tesla
accelerators but it also means another
rot and memory controller partition has
been enabled relative to the standard
titan v the regular titan v has 12 gig
of HB m2 so it has three partitions
enabled leading to 96 ROPS a 3072 bit
memory bus and 4.5 Meg's of l2 cache in
pushing the CEO Edition to 32 gig of HB
m to the 4th partition needs to be
enabled which means the card has 128
ROPS of 4096 bit memory bus and 6
megabytes of l2 cache we don't have any
other official specification so it's not
clear what clock speeds the GPU or
memory will run at but if everything
remains the same as the regular Titan be
the CEO Edition will provide a
meaningful performance improvement in
both memory bandwidth or rot limited
applications curiously in video also
lists the CEO Edition as having 125
teraflops of tensor core performance up
from 110 teraflops with the standard
titan v so there might be some clock
speed gains there as well we'll have to
wait and see what the cards final specs
are and if it will ever come to retail
channels but for those out there with
Titan B's just know your $3,000 GPU has
now been superseded a MB is said to
overhaul free sync - shortly to help
alleviate consumer confusion over what
freesync - provides and also to update
the requirements to get free sync -
certification this is welcome news for
people thinking of upgrading to an HDR
monitor in the coming months
it was pretty unclear what free sync -
provided so hope you with these changes
I won't need to make another ten minute
video explaining what free sync - is all
about the first change is a minor name
update from free Singh - to free sync to
HDR consider increasing - is mostly
about HDR support this change makes it
much clearer to buyers what you are
getting when you see a monitor with the
free sync to HDR badge of course free
Singh - also specifies a lower input
latency and mandates support for low
framerate compensation but the most
visible and important feature for buyers
is definitely the HDR support the other
change is bigger and arguably more
important fruiting to HDR monitors must
now meet the display HDR 600
specification in other words a free sync
- certified monitor
support at least 600 nits of peak flash
brightness and must cover 99% of the BT
709 color space and 90% of DCI p3 the
spec also mandates certain black levels
between LCDs conforming to display HDR
600 need some form of local dimming
originally freezing to only required
display HDR 400 conformance however
that's a fairly weak HDR spec it doesn't
really give a true HDR experience for
example display HDR 400 doesn't mandate
wider than si G because or particularly
impressive peak brightness levels
whereas display HDR 600 does this change
should mean that freezing to HDR
certified monitors will be able to
deliver a decent HDR experience rather
than potentially no real HDR at all it's
not clear what will happen to Mahlon is
that past the original freezing to
certification for example they passed
display HDR 400 certification but would
fail the tighter freezing to HDR process
hopefully MD can prevent these models
from use increasing tube badges on their
packaging and remove any references to
free sync to on their website so because
you miss don't accidentally purchase one
thinking they're getting good HDR some
motherboard vendors are preparing to
drop support for Bristol Ridge ap used
on the am for boards due to lack of
space in the BIOS most motherboards uses
16 megabytes chip to store the BIOS and
associated micro code for all supported
processes however with aim for growing
to support a wide and wider range of
CPUs and ap use some vendors are running
out of space on the chip to store all
the microcode they need the solution at
least in the case of some vendors is to
drop support for the least popular hem
for processes and in that case it's
Bristol Ridge considering there is very
little reason to buy a Bristol Ridge APU
in 2018 there there really isn't a big
loss here other vendors have explored
expanding the size of the bio strip to
32 megabytes however the cost of this
larger chip is more than double the 16
megabytes chip some vendors have looked
into using two 16 Meg's but again that's
a higher cost which doesn't really work
that well with budget boards
anyway it's an interesting problem that
motherboard vendors are facing them
short future boards will introduce a
proper solution that doesn't require
dropping support for some CPUs Intel has
once again inadvertently confirmed the
existence of eight core coffee lake s
CPUs
over in their resource and design center
hot hardware uncovered
customer communication for a Z on a
coffee like s8 core processor which
indicates that there will be an a core
CPU headed to Intel's mainstream server
lineup in the near future there's not a
whole lot else to say here other than
the document details Intel's component
sample identification and usage
guidelines the document has since been
removed which suggests it was published
early by a mistake hopefully it won't be
too long until we hear more about
Intel's eight core processor not just
the Zeon's but also for standard
desktops moving into some more quicker
topics of this week Samsung has
announced a new 8 terabyte SSD that uses
the nf1 form factor the drive is unnamed
at the moment but it does feature
sixteen 512 gigabyte NAND packages and a
new controller that supports both PCIe
4.0 and nvm a 1.3 if you're wondering
what the nf1 form factor is it's
basically a modified wider m2 designed
for enterprise that allows a single SSD
stick to pack two rows of chips per side
this means better density which is
crucial for some enterprise customers
performance wise we're looking at 3.1
and 2.0 gigabytes per second sequential
reads and writes respectively
along with 500 ki ops random reads but
just 50 ki UPS random writes the drive
is available now though as with a lot of
enterprise products there is no public
price and if there was it'll probably
blow our minds anyway asa has launched
two new monitors if you can really call
them monitors one is a 49 inch IPS LCD
and the other is an even larger 55 inch
IPS LCD not sure why anyone would want
to sit in front of a 55 inch monitor
especially for a Productivity task but I
guess it might make sense for gaming
both pact 4k resolutions and HDR support
or low brightness tops out of just 350
nits and there's just a 1200 to 1
contrast ratio so don't expect great HDR
there we're looking at pricing of around
550 us for the 49 inch and 800 us for
the 55 inch ah oh and before I move on
these are the official names of the
monitors the EB 4 9 0 qk BM III pfx and
the eb-5 50 kb em III px are you
actually serious I say is that the best
you could come up with for a monitor
geez some Mauro names are just
horrendous
anyway some cool
looking minds from a seven we'll get
those fairly shortly Western Digital has
expanded their line of purple hard
drives with new 10 and 12 terabyte
models that are deep learning capable
and include all frame AI technology yep
they are marketed as AI optimized
surveillance drives hard drives that are
AI optimized anyway they're available
now priced at $400 for 10 terabytes and
$480 for 12 terabytes the steam summer
sale is now on so head over to the steam
store and check out all the deals buy a
few games you won't play for years
complete the usual set of minigames and
other fun stuff get good deals on
popular tiles you know the drill it's on
now so go check it out and one last
rumor to finish this news corner off
Hong Kong website HK EPC suggest the
name of AMD's upcoming 3200m Ripper CPU
is the thread Ripper 2990 X the rest of
the specifications they're claiming
don't seem right at all such as the 3.4
gigahertz base clock and 4.0 gigahertz
single core boost when
mb has already said the CPU at least for
their test systems using a 3.0 gigahertz
base but the name is pretty cool
hopefully AMD goes with it anyway that's
it that this week's news corner don't
