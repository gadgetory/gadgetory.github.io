unbox yes it's time to talk about the
Samsung Galaxy s8 plus so this is the
company's new flagship Android
smartphone for 2017 there's a ton of
interesting new features to talk about
so this could be a long one so stay
tuned
but before I get into any of the
features or anything like that I do want
to mention that because I live in
Australia of course I've been sent an
extra nice model of the si+ if you're in
North America you will be given a
variant with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835
SOC inside but for us in the rest of the
world including Europe and Australia
it's the Exynos 88-90 5s SSO a bit
different from some of those United
States reviews that you might be seeing
out there we'll be talking all about the
performance of the external world
exclusively in this review simply
because I haven't had any hand side of
time at the other variant so just before
we get any further keep in mind that all
the benchmarks that we'll be showing you
guys a little later are also available
to view in text spots written review
over on tech spot comm including some
benchmarks that we don't put in this
video so head over there after you
checked out the whole video here for
more content available on the Galaxy S
A+ anyway onto the show because we need
to talk about the design of this handset
and there's a lot of things to like
about it and obviously one big downside
as well to talk about so the main thing
to notice with the Galaxy S a plus of
course is the screen to body ratio
Samsung has gone basically removed the
bezels on the smartphone entirely to
slot in that 6.2 inch AMOLED display
that occupies almost the entire front
panel they've removed the navigation
buttons along the bottom edge instead
going with on-screen navigation buttons
and they've significantly shrunk the
bezel at the top of the screen even
though it still includes things like the
center notification LED speaker and
front facing camera you still get all
those features but this screen simply
takes up so much of the front of this
handset that it looks extremely
futuristic you really don't notice how
dated and ugly other smartphones look
with their massive bezels until you get
your hands on the galaxy s 8 plus this
is a futuristic design trend that other
companies will need to imitate to keep
up with the pack
I don't want to see big vessels on
phones anymore now that I've used the
galaxy si plus of course you also see
those curved display edges I'm not a
huge fan of those person I think they
add a bit of distortion to the display
experience but it certainly looks
awesome when you sort of take it out of
the box and go wow you know that's the
phone's curves got glass on either side
looks fantastic and that translates into
the rest of the build of this handset I
mean it's metal around the edges it
looks and feels great in your hands
glass fully on the back again gives you
that premium look while still allowing
wireless charging to be a thing in this
handset and the build quality it's
seamless it's fantastic and it's such a
big step up from what we used to see
from Samsung and phones like the galaxy
s5 they revolutionize their design
language with the galaxy s6 and they've
refined it incredibly in the galaxy s 8
plus to make this the best looking phone
you can get on the market at the moment
the one downside though that comes with
making a phone with these materials and
its build is that as Steve mentioned in
his video where he ranted about his own
galaxy
si plus this is an incredibly fragile
phone we've seen reports all over the
internet that discuss how you know phone
repair shops going crazy because they're
making tons of money on people who are
buying s8 pluses or s apes dropping them
within the first week and the screen
shattering one of the reasons for this
is due to that curved edge it doesn't
add a lot of rigidity to the design if
you drop it on your desk on the edge
there's a chance that the weak glass in
that area will shatter and also glass on
the back that's another weak point of
the phone drop it on the back and that
glass will shatter as well on top of
that it's extremely slippery because
you've got the oleophobic coating on
both sides to attempt to prevent
fingerprints at school a fingerprint
magnet it slips out of your hand like
nothing else it slides along desks
there's not much of a rim around the
edges you do get that metal there that
gives you a bit of grip but it's just
not slim it's just not large enough on
those edges to make it easy to hold the
device I if it slips out of your hand
you're pretty much ruined so that is one
thing to know it's a bit disappointing
because Samsung has clearly made the
most attractive smartphone body on the
market at the same time you're spending
you know 800 bucks on the phone and
you'll want to keep it secure
the entire time that you're using it and
with the si+ that means you pretty much
need to get a case so you've got that
awesome design but at the other hand you
need a case that makes it look ugly and
pretty crap to prevent it from breaking
it's a bit of a downside as far as the
SI plus is concerned and kind of hinders
my recommendation of it a little bit if
you're willing to put up with the case
you get some great features but at the
end of the day I'd really want to see
that design and all of its glory without
it being so fragile there's another
issue with the galaxy a-pluses design
and that is the position of the
fingerprint sensor which is simply
pretty dumb I mean what with Samsung's
engineers thinking putting the
fingerprint sensor right next to the
camera lens whenever you go to activate
the fingerprint sensor you'll be putting
grimy fingerprints all over the camera
lens and that can impact the camera
quality quite significantly after a
couple of attempts of hitting that
sensor so I would have made a lot more
sense to put the fingerprint sensor
below the camera so that you're not
constantly grimy up the camera and
having to clean it all the time
yeah it's just a pretty dumb move as far
as that's concerned you do get a bunch
of great features throughout the si+ as
design though USBC is included on the
bottom for the first time exam some gear
VR headset is held back the s7 edge from
coming with the USB C port when you get
that on the SI parts of the first time
you still get the 3.5 mm audio jack
phones that don't have that as simply
stupid it's fully water resistant ip68
so you can use it underwater in a fresh
water don't use it in salt water it will
corrode the phone but aside from that
you know splash resistant and all of
that you a tray on the top of your nano
SIM and also a micro SD card so you
still get expandable storage in this
handset the notification LED I still
love that feature about phones Union led
notification LED in all Android handsets
to be honest and yeah the speaker that's
included on the bottom are not too great
in terms of its quality but it does go
pretty loud a super fern you know dual
front-facing speakers on your phone but
when you're sacrificing the bezels you
know you probably can't fit too much of
a speaker setup in there so I forgive
samsung a little bit for that one this
player is obviously one of the key areas
that Samsung has upgraded from the s7
edge we're now seeing a 6.2 inch Super
AMOLED with a resolution of 20
60 by 1440 so an 18 point 5 to 9 aspect
ratio making this display much taller
than you'd normally see on a traditional
smartphone compared to the s7 edge it's
17% larger the main thing that's changed
here is the height of the display
obviously you get 400 extra pixels of
vertical height the width of the two
displays 5.5 inches on the s7 edge 1
which is 6 point 2 inches here it's
pretty similar in terms of its width but
again it just Samsung has expanded the
display vertically to occupy more of the
front of the handset and I think that
that is an excellent choice because
screen to body ratio is all the rage
these days in terms of usability even
though this display is taller and larger
than last year's model I still found it
easy to hold and operate this phone I
think the width is usually the limiting
factor here for display usability so the
extra height doesn't make a significant
difference here most Android
applications support the expanded aspect
ratio perfectly fine by default for
those that are locked to 16:9 Samsung
has a handy toggle that lets you expand
the app to use the full display and this
works pretty much perfectly in all the
time so I had to use it the main benefit
is having the taller display despite it
using more of the handset profile it
does make it easy to use of split screen
mode that's included Android 7.0 you can
see a bit more of each application on
the screen and any one time although one
of the downsides I guess is that if
you're watching a video that's shot in
16:9 like most videos on YouTube or
whatever you will see black bars on
either side of the display you can zoom
in the video so that it occupies the
full 18 point five to nine I display
aspect ratio but that cropped the top
and bottom of the video not too keen on
that so I tended to just put up with the
black bars on either side but I can't
see most people making content 18 point
5 to 9 aspect ratio so this is an issue
that will plague all phones that decide
to use that expanded you know display
aspect ratio though I still would put up
with that considering just how awesome
the display looks on this handset when
looking at display performance and some
is still a leader in terms of their
Super AMOLED technology we're getting
the traditional benefits of AMOLED tech
deeper black levels that lead to an
infinite contrast ratio which really
make colors pop on this display
viewing angles are fantastic
case with all amyloids viewing this
displayed off angles you get almost no
color shift and the main benefits
something that Samsung has managed to
engineer really well in the MLS is a
high peak brightness over 570 nets in
the s8 plus makes this display very easy
to view outside traditional amyloids
tend to sit in more of the 300 to 400
nits peak brightness range but I guess
Samsung doesn't worry about power
consumption just pushes it straight to
the max in the SI plus it's almost LCD
territory in terms of that particular
aspect in terms of color accuracy this
is an area that sounds sometimes to
calibrate out-of-the-box they go for
again with it's outside of srgb which
leads to an oversaturated display in
general of course that leads to poor
color accuracy because Android has no
color management to speak of if the
government is outside srgb you will be
seeing oversaturated and too vibrant
imagery but I think that tends to look
really awesome on a smartphone and
something that most people look for when
they're working in this way you know
they pick up a phone in the store
whatever to test out they go wow you
know that that just works awesome it's a
vibrant it's beautiful and now that's
pretty much what most people want so I
guess you can kind of forgive the poor
accuracy and in terms of you know our
saturation and color checker results
there however for those that do need
their phone to have a color accurate
display whether that's creative
professionals developing apps or
something like that Samsung does have a
basic display mode that you can switch
to that improves the color accuracy
significantly it tends to make the
operating system look pretty crap
because Samsung designs their operating
system for the vibrant display but it
pulls back in the saturation color check
a gross scale performance significantly
it's not super accurate I prefer to see
a delta a value under two in most of
these tests like on the Galaxy s7 edge
but it still is a big change from the
default color performance mode it's also
we're talking about a feature I haven't
seen as phone's performer is the
resolution toggle out of the box this
phone is set to the FHD plus mode so
that's a 1080p equivalent display
resolution here you will want to push
that up to the full 20 960 by 1440
resolution as soon as you get it because
it does give you that extra sharpness
and Clara
when fewer things like photos and text
moving on to the performance now and as
I mentioned earlier there are two
variants of the s8 parts available one
with the Snapdragon 835 that I won't be
talking about and also go to another
video or something if you're interested
in performance of that variant what I do
have with me is the very with the Exynos
88-90 v SOC inside so the main upgrade
here in terms of last year's model the
galaxy s7 edge that use the Exynos 88-90
is a shift from a 14 nanometer to a 10
animated manufacturing no to increased
efficiency and slightly better
performance there we're still seeing an
optical design split into two quad-core
clusters the high-performance cluster
uses externals and one CPU cores clocked
it up to 2.3 gigahertz in the s8 plus
and the energy efficient cost of this
use for low performance tasks is arm
cortex a53 CPU cores clocks it up to 1.7
gigahertz here in terms of GPU we're
looking at a Mallee g71 MP 20 with a
clock of 546 megahertz so a big upgrade
on the Exynos 88-90 also seeing an
lpddr4 X memory controller is attached
to 4 gigabytes of RAM in the galaxy s 8
plus and we're also seeing 64 gigabytes
of NAND we're seeing LTE categories 16
for the first time in an external chip
so that means you get gigabit LTE
downstream category 13 upstream also
seen bluetooth 5 in a smart phone from
the first time Wi-Fi 802.11 AC NFC all
the stuff that you're after in a
high-end phone you're getting in this
particular device as we move to
benchmarks because that's of course what
you guys are interested in and taking a
look at how the X on off eight eight
nine five performs across a range of CPU
limited workloads it's around 22% faster
than the s7 edge with its 890 in their
CPU limited system benchmarks despite
having a lower clock speed on the
high-performance cause it sounds like
they'll say that we should be seeing a
27% performance improvements a little
bit lower than that across the board but
it still leads to a very snappy
experience in everyday tasks although
Tory won't notice a big difference if
you're moving just from the s7 edge
compared to a device with the Snapdragon
820 one like the pixel EXO 2 and 20%
faster on average how
of our the whywe meet nine which
includes a cure in 960 SOC the si+ fall
short by around 6% the cortex 873 cpu
cores used in the q9 6g tend to be a bit
more power from the m2 s that we're
seeing in the 88 and 95 both of these
phones you know are very strong
contenders here if you're upgrading from
a two-year-old external powered galaxy
s6 to Android 37 percent better CPU
performance so decent results there
we're looking at GPU workloads again the
mallard g71 MP 20 is a big upgrade on
last year's model we're seeing a 60%
faster GPU compared to the galaxy s7
edge with the Exynos chip inside pretty
massive performance difference here and
when you're limiting to just on screen
benchmarks si+ still holds a 54%
performance advantage over the s7 edge
despite its increased resolution
compared to phones with the Snapdragon
820 one inside games are a bit small and
around the 39 percent performance
improvement still pretty impressive
compared to Qualcomm of last generation
silicon and compared to the mate no 0
960 which also uses a mallard g71 but
only the MP 8 variant the SI plus pulls
way of around 32% on average in it in
general VRS 8 plus here with the g71 MP
20 tends to perform around the same mark
as the iPhone 7 plus and we know how
powerful Apple's GPU is in there a 10
SOC unfortunately I don't have enough
data to compare the eight at 9 5 to a
Snapdragon 835 SOC at the moment so
that's a check back on hardware box soon
because I do have an 835 device to take
a look at shortly what are the main
issues with Samsung's Exynos sots has
always been throttling and that is no
exception
unfortunately with the s8 plus we're
still seeing after about 25 minutes of
an intensive gaming workload that the
GPU inside the Exynos 88-90 5 throws by
over 40% which reduces the performance
pretty significantly it still does
outperform chips like the Snapdragon 820
one after it you know throttling for
each tube is factored in but I really
prefer to see this throttling for within
the range of Qualcomm chips which tend
to be more in the 20 to 30% range 40% is
a lot and I think so
need to work on that a little bit in
their various that they are shipping to
most international customers in terms of
man performance are they have improved
these sequential performance a bit
compared to the s7 edge getting very
soil sequential results here however
random results still still fall sort of
middle of the pack I'd like to see
better random performance that would
improve some of the you know uploading
app writing to storage sort of works
workloads that we see in smartphones but
disappointing the router performance
here but you know generally using the
si+ it's a very snappy device and
applications very extremely quickly it's
the top-end phone to go expect good
performance that's what we're seeing
across the board here samsung has paired
great performance with great battery
life in the SI plus hopefully we're not
going to see any explosions this time
around but we are seeing a 3500 milliamp
hour battery here slightly smaller than
the 3600 milliamp hour so that we saw
the s7 edge but thanks to the increased
efficiency of the 10 nanometer SOC
battery life tends to be around the same
mark as the s7 edge in some of our
benchmarks like our web browsing task
Falls a little bit behind and other
tests it can pull a little bit ahead so
it just depends on the metric that
you're looking at but generally very
good performance across the board
compared to one of my favorite phones on
the market the Google picks or Excel the
si+ lasts around 10% longer on average
that's a very strong result here it's
great to see good battery life in a
high-end phone we don't want to see
they're not going for something that's
too slim and negating battery life
entirely the SA pass will last you all
day no rows one thing to note though
this is important the s8 plus uses an
always-on display this is pretty handy
you get to see things like your time and
notifications all the time but leaving
this feature on does impact your standby
battery life which is not reflected in
these charts I like having the feature
enabled it's great it gives me
information at my fingertips whenever I
pull my phone out of my pocket or
whatever but it will reduce of standby
battery life so if you do want to get
your phone to last as long as possible
you will have to disable that feature
out of the box I feel like I've been
sitting here talking for ages on the si
plus but it's definitely still more to
get through and most notably the camera
Samsung has done something unusual here
and that they haven't upgraded the
camera sensor from the s7 edge we're
still seeing the same 12 megapixel
sensor with 1.4 micron pixels with
optical image state
and an F 1.7 lens so we're still getting
the same dual pixel technology and what
that means is that along with the light
detecting pixel in the sensor every
single pixel is also paired with the
phase detection unit meaning that
focusing speeds are pretty much
unparalleled you put your phone up to a
subject and it's focused almost
immediately on the si+ that's one of the
great features about this camera one of
the things Samsung has improved is the
processing they've tweaked it slightly
and I think the main thing that is
upgraded here is its dynamic range you
get photos with a bit more depth in them
and improve performance in sort of your
indoor artificial lighting settings and
at low light but have improved in the in
terms of its dynamic range you still get
fantastic results across the board
photos taken with the s8 plus look great
if they're outdoors they look pretty
good when it's indoors cameras tend to
suffer a little bit here but the SI plus
one of the best performers indoors
detail not too fantastic Samsung does
play apply aggressive post-processing
noise reduction filter so if you zoom in
you will see some of the oil painting
effect here which is a bit disappointing
but in terms of its you know color
performers photos are vibrant they look
great they tend to be well meted unless
you're in a cloudy situation or you're
in tricky indoor lighting situations
some of my photos were tinted a bit red
in indoor situations and looked a bit
cold if it's cloudy but aside from those
sort of minor deficiencies you be
getting great photos from the si plus
it's a very dependable camera your point
of shoot you get great results and
that's what I've seen from Samsung
phones in the past one thing to mention
is that I didn't think the photos from
this camera were quite as good as I
found in the Google pixel Excel the
pixel excel has an incredible automatic
HDR mode that just produces fantastic
photos across the board the s8 plus
isn't close good the indoor situations
that the pixel excel exceeds in but
still very strong performance when the
SI plus and I think it's probably the
second best camera on the market at the
moment you also get a great range of
other camera features like your
traditional slow-motion modes there's a
hyper lapse mode I was really impressed
with the manual mode you get to control
our whole range of features almost pro
DSL our level here looking at your ISO
your shutter speed your white balance
but all
things like your metering mode and also
your focus mode which we don't normally
see on smartphones I love having those
controls in this particular device 4k
video recording on the rear camera you
can also get 1080p 60 frames per second
recording if you want that on the front
is limited to just 1440p recording but I
was pretty impressed with the
front-facing camera this has been
upgraded from the s7 edge to an 8
megapixel sensor with autofocus and F
1.7 lens yet some pretty decent
background blur in your selfies from
this camera and improve low-light
performance i love the companies focus
on the selfie performance in low light
and the si+ succeeds pretty well in this
regard
software is always a contentious issue
when it comes to samsung devices because
i know a lot of people out there don't
like their TouchWiz interface atop
android 7.0 but i think they've made
some pretty decent strides in improving
the visual styles their interface in
what they're now calling the samsung
experience apparently it's no longer
TouchWiz it is the Samsung experience
some of the things they've done across
the board is make it look more
professional make it look more neat make
it flatter reduce some of the childish
and cartoonish elements that they used
in their previous things is much more
clean there's clean lines nice rounded
elements I really like some of the
design tweaks that they've made here it
fits in reasonably well with stock
Android they use some elements from
Google stock Android design here though
it's not necessarily the same and still
allows the si+ of software to standout
from stock Android Samsung has made a
number of changes to elements around the
Android interface you'll see the
notification pane is a vastly different
visual style but you still get pretty
similar features like your highly
informative notifications you still get
your quick setting toggle split into two
settings along with the brightness
slider Samsung has cut down the
unnecessary crap here in favor of just
the elements you need which is pretty
decent the settings screen has also been
changed significantly with the
simplified design making it far easier
to navigate than any previous Samsung
hands that love the condensed sub menus
here and they even give you a few tips
to try and make it easier to navigate
through the sections if you happen to
stumble into the wrong area there also a
lot of features throughout the software
I'm not going to discuss everything
because some of the stuff we've seen in
previous galaxy s7 devices and so for
things like your app notification
blocker full theming support there's a
one-handed moon just your support and
even a game launch of things like
improving performance and you know
capturing some in-game footage on the
handset itself does even a new
maintenance tool makes it easy to do
things like management Bachelor life and
Storage turn on performance mode secure
your handset and so forth
I like seeing tools like that included
it's a nice way to condense all that
information into the one easy-to-use
utility blood wear isn't as much of an
issue on the s8 plus because during the
setup utility you can choose to not
install a bunch of unnecessary crap like
there Jupiter internet browsers like FS
health and so forth I really like that
feature actually I wish more companies
would choose to rid yourself of the
bloatware and their setup utility
however there are still a number of
bloatware and unnecessary apps in my
opinion included on this phone there is
a duplicating gallery app and most
notably Galaxy apps I don't know why
samsung feels the need to include that
own app store on the s8 plus Google Play
is a perfectly fine utility Samsung just
update your apps through the Google Play
School please I don't need to see it
galaxy apps on this phone so if you
other bits of bloatware here and there
as well not the cleanest android
experience going around but Samsung are
making some improvements in that regard
the edge screen is still a feature
included on the si+ apparently sent some
things you need a curved display for the
edge screen but really could be
implemented easily on a flat screen
anyway are you simply swipe in from the
right of the display to bring up the
edge screen it's got apps shortcuts to
apps that you use frequently there's
some contacts that you might want to
know speed dial in then perhaps the most
useful features some of its
screenshotting utility but to go the
edge screen got in the way more than it
helped me out throughout my time is near
safe pass and I pretty much just
disabled it from the get-go it's not too
useful another feature I didn't find too
useful was Bixby which is the main new
software inclusion on the SI + / to be
honest it's a pretty straightforward
clone of both google now an assistant it
doesn't add a whole lot of new
functionality that couldn't have been
achieved through implementing either of
those features you do get Google
Assistant on its handset it is a far
better option for voice searching from
what I've heard although I can't
actually use big speed voice in
Australia - not included here just yet
Bixby home is included on the leftmost
and of the homescreen includes things
like your calendar reminders whether
some news information reminders so forth
in there these are all things we've seen
before in Google now it doesn't really
add a whole lot to the experience
they're a big speed vision the easiest
way to categorize this is it's similar
to Google Goggles back in the day though
you point your camera at something it
tries to identify it tries to show you
information a bit more of a gimmick than
useful I wouldn't go around you know
using bixby vision on things every
single day so yeah bit of a gimmick
there not to a person with big spit
overall but Lee sounds like you know
they're trying something new they're
trying to compete with Google assistants
but pretty much just use Google
assistant if you needed that
functionality
unfortunately Samsung thought the big
screen would be so useful that they
include a dedicated button for it on the
left hand side of the phone the amount
of times I've used this button is
probably once just to test that it
actually worked because unfortunately
you can't win that but does something
useful I really love it if you could
remap the big sweet button to your
favorite app or even something more
useful like Google assistant but you
can't on the SI parts without a third
party utility and that's pretty
disappointing if you're including a
dedicated button that could be remapped
to something Samsung you should allow us
to remap but that's good user practice
but before you can't do it on the si+
are much to my disappointment so if
you've made it all the way through my
galaxy A+ review to the M here let's
recap what I think is awesome in this
handset so the design it looks fantastic
it looks futuristic with that display
occupying almost all of the front panel
the build quality is immaculate and you
know other manufacturers will really
need to step up their game and produce
more zero bezel handsets because this is
where the design trend is heading and
this futuristic design makes all other
phones are pretty crap in my opinion the
display itself Super AMOLED looks
awesome great viewing angles great
brightness great resolution
looks vibrant and over saturating gem
which I know a lot of people like
fantastic performance in the Exynos
88-90 5 even though it's throttles at
some situations great back to life once
again the camera is fantastic produces
excellent photos almost across the board
thanks to some minor tweaks and focusing
speeds are still very fast doesn't quite
come to the same level
the pixel Excel becoming in second
message to a fantastic feed as far as
cameras are concerned we're still seeing
some great tweaks to the software it's
improving TouchWiz every year even
though bloatware is still an issue big
speed doesn't add a whole lot to the
experience and we're still getting
pretty useless edge screen but there's a
lot of features packed into the galaxy s
8 plus that some people will find it
useful
the main downsides to this phone are the
horrible position of the fingerprint
sensor on the back and the fact that
it's pretty much the most fragile phone
ever made you're going to need to put on
a case on this phone so that doesn't
shatter when you drop it for the first
time that's a disappointing aspect
really because they've made one of the
most beautiful designs ever as far as
smartphones are concerned but they
haven't made it sturdy enough for
everyday use if you're one of the people
that loves could be cases on your phones
anyway
by all means go out and buy the s8 plus
and enjoy the excellent functionality
and features that it provides but if you
rather use your phones without a case
you want to see the beauty of the
handset you don't want the extra bulk
and unattractiveness that is provided by
a case then perhaps the si+ isn't for
you and if you look on the market for
some of the other options like the LG G
6 and other phones that are coming up in
the coming months that's what I main
take away here by the SI plus if you
like using the case don't buy it if you
think it's too fragile and yeah check
