expensive really expensive that has to
be said high-end PC hardwoods in
generals expensive there's obviously a
market for this stuff and we're seeing
it on all levels from extreme keyboards
cases power suppliers and insanely
over-the-top GPUs and CPUs the GeForce
GTX 1080 for example that launched back
in May of 2016 at $600 u.s. or $700 for
the founders edition version and I have
to admit I thought that was pretty good
value at the time they spent board
partner versions we're going to come in
around 50 dollars cheaper than the gtx
980ti of the previous generation while
offering around 30% more performance
however we knew bigger and better things
were on the way and eventually we did
get the gtx 980ti and ignoring the silly
over-the-top tight next stuff the 1080i
is now the best option for gamers with
deep pockets priced at $700 us the 1080i
pushed to the 1080 down to $500 and even
with the release of AMD's RX vega series
Nvidia hasn't been forced into price
cuts as much as I really like my Radeon
rx Vega 64 liquid-cooled graphics card
at $800 it just can't compete with the
gtx 980ti
with 1080 TI cards stepping in at around
750 dollars right now they offer vastly
superior performance in most titles what
I really like about the Vega 64
liquid-cooled graphics card is that all
in one liquid cooler there's no fans on
the card itself all the heat generated
by the graphics card is transferred via
liquid to a 120 millimeter radiator and
it's expelled outside of the case it's
an effective solution that not only
keeps the card cool but also lowers case
temperatures while reducing the overall
operating volume the GTX 1080 Ti is a
much more power efficient graphics card
and with a big heat sink and a trio fans
it can be kept a relatively cool while
remaining very quiet
that said the air-cool models are
massively heavy and they do still dump
huge amount of heat into the case and
then your case and case fans not have to
deal with that heat and some of the core
components or the critical components on
the PCB still do get quite hot from all
the heat that the GPU generates that
isn't as efficiently removed as it could
be this can be
- for those building high-end gaming
rigs in smaller cases the easiest
solution of course is to get something
with an all-in-one liquid cooler and
thankfully there are a few good options
I've been eyeing off the EVGA gtx 1080i
for the win three hybrid gaming quite a
mouthful and the msi gtx 1080 TI seahawk
ex a little less of a mouthful both do
look great but they do have fans on the
cards and that's something I wanted to
avoid and right now they do appear to be
hideously expensive then I recently
stumbled across the easy to say gigabyte
Oris GT X 1080 TI water force Extreme
Edition no the short name there cool
thing about this card though is there is
only a single fan it's a 120 millimeter
fan and it's on the radiator so no fans
on the card itself admittedly though the
card is a bit expensive at $880 us but
it is cheaper than the versions just
mentioned from EVGA and MSI at least as
we speak the 1080 TI waterfalls looks to
have everything I'm after but when
dishing out this kind of cash you really
want to know just how good a product is
so then today we're taking a closer look
to see just what gigabyte has on offer
here right away I have to admit this
product doesn't look and feel as premium
as you might expect the card is wrapped
in a plastic shroud which looks okay but
it certainly makes the model feel much
cheaper than it really is and I would
have much preferred an aluminium housing
here this is something I was expecting
and hoping to find admittedly the
plastic does serve the purpose quite
well but as I said it just looks and
feels a bit cheap in my opinion there's
also a clear Xavier section of the car
which shows off the liquid cooling block
the pretty bland affair but of course
somehow GB lighting has been in better
here to liven things up the back side of
the card features a full-length
backplate which looks good but again if
the copper insert is the version you'd
find on the lower end cards and not the
same as other extreme edition models so
that was a bit surprising meanwhile
around at the io end we find a dual link
DVI output along with two HDMI 2.0 B
outputs and a trio of DisplayPort 1.4
outputs so the card is very rich in
terms of connectivity and around at the
option of the car we also find a HDMI
output for VR link so that's kind of
neat as well then of course hanging off
the card we have a one
and 20 millimeter radiator with a 120
millimeter fan connected the fan is
powered by the graphics card so there's
no need to plug any additional cords in
here meanwhile connecting the radiator
to the block and pump on the graphics
card are a pair of braided fep tubes
that span about 360 millimeters long now
if we remove the cooler from the cart we
find a 265 millimeter long PCB that
measures about a hundred and twenty
millimeters tall at its tallest gigabyte
says that the cart is built for extreme
overclocking and on board we find a 12 +
2 phase power design this is the same
configuration that we found on the
impressive Oris GTX 1082 I extreme
edition the air-cooled model of course
in fact it's the exact same PCB design
though there are a few minor component
changes here and there the key change of
course though here is the cooler whereas
the air-cooled model features a 970 gram
cooler hanging off it the water force
Extreme Edition only has 418 grams worth
of cooler strapped onto the PCB the
cooler itself is of a very elegant
design and takes care of everything
including the GPU gddr5 X memory and of
course the vrm naturally though the GPU
does take priority here and it is cooled
directly via the copper block then
attached to the block is a copper base
which covers the 11 memory chips and
then finally attached to that is a large
aluminium nickel plated section which
covers the vrm so it will be very
interesting to see how cool this card
runs out of the box the card comes
clocked at a base speed of 1600 and 7
megahertz which allows for a boost clock
of at least 1721 megahertz
there is also an OC mode which can be
enabled at the click of a button and
this boosts the base to sixteen hundred
and thirty-two megahertz resulting in a
boost clock speed of at least seventeen
hundred and forty six megahertz this
means out of the box the card comes with
a 9 percent factory overclock so that's
not bad still if you like me prefer to
apply your own overclock then let's see
what can be found with a little
tinkering the core was able to accept a
frequency of sixteen hundred and
eighty-seven megahertz while the gddr5 X
memory was good for 1500 megahertz or a
transfer speed of twelve gigabits per
second of course due to the way that in
videos GPU boost 3.0 works we know that
the card can run faster than the
suggested boost clock speeds have kept
under the thermal and power targets in
the case of the water force Extreme
Edition this allowed the card to hold
operating frequency you have 2.1
gigahertz after a 20-minute stress test
which is certainly up there with the
best result we've seen today for those
wondering in its out-of-the-box
configuration the cart operated around
nineteen hundred and thirty six
megahertz under full load and that's
around seven percent higher than most of
the air-cooled models we've tested
before I jump to the benchmarks please
note this won't be a detailed benchmark
review in terms of framerate performance
we really already know whether 1080 Ti
is positioned will get a pretty good
idea of how this Oris liquid cooled
version stacks up in just a few games so
then on to the benchmarks first up let's
check out the battlefield one results
here we see the water force looks very
strong pushing 144 FPS on average at
1440p this minute was 5% faster than the
Galaxy GT X 1080 t IE x OC and almost
30% faster than vega 64 liquid-cooled
moving to 4k we were able to push over
60 fps at all times of the horas water
force card and once our custom overclock
was applied the minimum frame rate never
dipped below 65 fps very impressive
stuff next up we have Ghost Recon
wildlands and healer liquid-cooled 1080
TI water force is again 5% faster than
the air-cooled GT x 1080 Ti through
custom overclocking we were able to
squeeze out a few more frames that
almost managed an average of 100 FPS
using the very high quality settings
jumping to 4k it was no longer possible
to maintain over 60 fps at all times but
even so the water force model did an
exceptional job and did average 62 FPS
once overclocked moving on we have Hal
blade and this title plays really well
at 1440p here the Auris water force
average 96 FPS and pushed up to 99 FPS
once overclocked again falling just
short of 100 FPS this game like many is
very demanding once we hit the 4k
resolution here the water force averaged
50 fps and just 52 FPS once overclocked
but still a very good result quake
champions plays well on mid-range
hardware but if you're chasing big frame
rates at 1440p then the water force can
certainly help you out here we
comfortably saw an average of over 200
FPS while the minimum never dipped below
155 FPS even at the 4k resolution the
Auris water force
eats up quake champions and spits out an
average of a hundred and eleven FPS out
of the box that's pretty impressive
stuff and this was an
noteworthy bump over the air-cooled GTX
ten ATT I finally we have player knowns
battlegrounds and here the 1082 I
delivers the ultimate experience frame
rates were super smooth or at least they
were for this title as the water force
averaged 95 FPS out of the box even at
4k the game played quite well though the
minimum frame rate was around 40 fps so
it wasn't exactly an ideal scenario then
when it came to power draw the Auris GTX
1080i water force was very good out of
the box I've been drawing about the same
amount of power as your more standard
1080 T Ives I have a clock total system
consumption was increased by 9% which
made the card less efficient but if
you're chasing maximum performance well
it's certainly worth the other draw the
card still ran very cool and quiet as
well the Auris GTX 1080i water force has
already impressed us with very strong
out-of-the-box performance and making
the numbers just seen even more
impressive is the fact that the card
operates at just 50 degrees under full
load for over an hour
the very best air-cooled cards we've
seen to date with massive 1 kilo heat
sinks running around 65 degrees and most
of you more typical 1080 T is due push
over 70 degrees so a 50 degree low temp
is most impressive indeed the car was
also virtually silent at this
temperature then once overclocked a 2.1
you get hurt to the temperature increase
by just 5 degrees and even there the car
was still virtually silent I've really
only ever managed to achieve these kinds
of temperatures on air-cooled cards when
the fans are spinning at 100% and when
you have three rather large fans
spinning at that speed it does create
quite a racket so a super impressive
result for this gigabyte graphics card
well I think it's fair to say I have a
new favorite graphics card might not be
the prettiest going around but that 2.1
gigahertz overclock was mighty and it
wasn't all that difficult to achieve
moreover the card runs incredibly cool
and it does so while making virtually no
noise at all in fact under load for an
extended period of time it was still
basically silent the only issues of
course as is often the case with these
extreme graphics cards is the price
that's set at $880 us it's not
outrageous for what you get base models
are only 15% cheaper at 750 dollars
while many of the more desirable
coold versions they do solve for around
another 20 or 30 dollars of course this
water force version isn't going to
provide around 15 percent more
performance but it does enable extremely
low operating temperatures the
temperatures really are key here not
just for the car but also for your
entire system the water force dumps the
vast majority that hit the car generates
outside of the case whereas the
air-cooled models dump almost all if not
all of the heat inside the system so
this means that the case fans can also
operate at lower speeds with the water
force installed effectively reducing the
operating volume of the entire system
helping to justify the price premium is
gigabyte standard three year warranty
and I'll even add on an additional year
if you register for Oris care so that's
pretty cool overall I really like the
gigabyte or s GT X 1080 CI water force
extreme edition which the name was a bit
shorter and I also wish it featured an
all-aluminium shroud here rather than
the plastic design which feels a little
on the cheap side I have to say but
other than that I absolutely love the
card runs cool quiet and overclock like
a champ anyway let me know what you guys
think I'm your host Steve catch again
next time
