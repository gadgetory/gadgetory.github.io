video has been heavily requested so I've
made it a priority and it's the first of
these second generalized and exploration
videos that I have planned since the
release of the second gen rising cpus
many of you have been asking me for an
IPC comparison with intel's coffee like
cpus for those of you unaware IP C
stands for instructions per cycle and it
is a good indicator of a CPUs
performance the coffee like CPUs offer
high IPC coupled with high operating
frequency and that really is the best
combination for maximum performance
although AMD is clearly trailing when it
comes to frequency they appear to have
really closed up on intel's IPC
performance and that's likely why many
of you have been requesting this test
before we get into the IPC comparison
this video has been sponsored by
Squarespace whether you need a domain
website or online store make it with
Squarespace for more information please
check the link in the video description
to see just how much headway AMD's made
here we're going to neutralize as many
variables as we can while also keeping
things as realistic as possible the
first and most obvious step is to remove
call frequency from the equation and to
do this we've locked all CPU cores at 4
gigahertz any type of boost technology
has been disabled the course cannot go
past 4 gigahertz and all cores are again
locked at 4 gigahertz the second
generalising CPUs have been tested on
the asrock x4 70 Taichi ultimate and the
coffee-like CPUs on the asrock said 370
Taiji both configurations used the same
g.skill flex ddr4 3,200 memory using the
extreme memory profile and the same MSI
GTX 10 a DTI gaming extra was used for
all the testing this is purely for a
science type benchmark and is in no way
buying advice
the coffee-like cpus do have a clock
speed advantage there's simply no
getting away from that fact and for
real-world performance please refer to
our recent risin 5 2,600 2,600 X and
2,700 X reviews for this test I've
included results for the Intel Core i7
87 okay 8600 k horizon 7 2700 X 2600 X
and Verizon 7 1800 X along with the 1600
now the 1600 X 2600 X and 8700 K all
have the same CPU resources six cores
with 12 threads the 1800 X and 2700 X
have an advantage being they are eight
core 16 thread CPUs well the 8600 k is
at a disadvantage because it's a six
core six threaded CPU so please keep all
that in mind as we proceed right so
let's get to the results starting with
the sustained memory bandwidth test here
we see that the first and second
generation C abused are very similar
with a bandwidth of around 39 gigabytes
per second meanwhile using the exact
same memory the coffee-like CPUs are
limited to around 33 gigabytes per
second and this is a 15% reduction in
bandwidth when compared to the rise in
CPUs moving to the Cinebench r15 results
we see at the 2600 X scores 4 percent
higher than the 1600 for the
multi-threaded test and 3 percent higher
for the single thread test then as we
look at the 8700 K we see that it is 4
percent faster than the 2600 X for the
single threaded test but 4 percent
slower for the multi-threaded test as
you might have expected clock for clock
the 8 core 6 don't read rise and cpus
easily beat the multi-threaded score of
87 are ok I've included them simply
because I had the results depending on
demand
I could update this test with the core
i7 78 20x for example next up we have
the PC mark 10 video editing scores and
this is a more lightly threaded test
though we did previously see a
noteworthy difference between the 1600 X
and 1800 X as a result we see a solid 10
percent jump from the 16 hundreds to the
2600 X and this place is AMD on par with
Intel in terms of IPC performance for
this test like what we saw with these
Cinebench r15 benchmark when maxed out
SMT appears to be more efficient than
Intel's HT technology here the 6100 X
was fast nearly 700 K by a three and a
half percent margin while the 2600 X was
eight percent faster and that really is
a noteworthy margin right there next
that we have Excel and here the 87 her
cake was around 3% quick up than the
1600 X when matched clock for clock
however the 2600 X is able to match the
87 okay with the same completion time of
2.8 five seconds and
pretty impressive the handbrake test we
run doesn't leverage the AMD rising CPUs
that well and here we see at the 2600 X
is only able to match the 80 600 K and
therefore is 15% slower than the 80s 700
K moving on to the corona benchmark we
set the 2600 X is able to reduce the
render time by 8% when compared to the
1600 X and this MANET was just 3 percent
slower than the 8700 K so Intel still
holds an IPC advantage in this test but
it is very minor next up we have blender
and here the 2600 X was just two and a
half percent quicker than these 1600 X
and this made it 4 percent slower than
the 80s of her ok not a huge difference
and again while Intel still holds an IPC
advantage in this test it is less than
5% now using the v-ray benchmark we set
the 2600 X improves on the 1600 by 4%
margin and that met it was just a single
percent slower than the 87 okay so
basically on par here ok so time for
some gaming results and this is where
things come unstuck for AMD as we've
talked about in the past Intel's low
latency ring bus is just better suited
for gaming and we see this when
comparing their own mesh interconnect
architecture designed for the higher
core count CPUs the Infinity fabric
suffers the same problem as the mesh
architecture and it's not until gaming
CPUs require way more cause this problem
will go away for AMD so while the 2600 X
does improve on the 1600 X by an 8
percent margin and ashes of the
singularity it's still a whopping 11%
slow of nearly 700 K a couple that with
the fact that Intel CPU is clocked much
higher this can blow that margin out to
over 20% at times
moving on to Assassin's Creed origins
and here we see a mere 2% increase for
the 2600 X over the 1600 X while the 87
or ok is a further 14 percent faster the
margin is slightly reduced with the
higher quality preset but still the 87
Andrew K is 12% fast in the 2600 X when
comparing the average framerate when
testing with battlefield 1 using the
ultra quality preset we see the 2600 X
is 9% fast and the 1600 X but still 7%
slower than the 87 ok the margin is
completely blown out of the water with
the medium quality preset as the gtx
1080i is now able
better stretch its legs here the 2600 X
again off in a 9% increase over the 1600
X but is now 10% slower than 87 okay
which still appears to be GPU limited
it's a similar story when testing with
far cry 5 the 2600 X is again 10% faster
than the 1600 X which is a huge
improvement but even so it's still 8%
slower than the 8700 K moving on to
power consumption and firstly just let
me quickly point out that this isn't the
most realistic test and many of the
power are saving features are disabled
in our 4 gigahertz clock for clock
comparison it's also not the most
scientific because I have had to
increase the voltages for the rise in
CPUs above spec to stabilize and all
core overclock of 4 gigahertz so having
said that we see at least 1600 X and
2600 X systems consume the exact same
amount of power
meanwhile the 8700 K system consumed 3
percent less power making it slightly
more efficient under these test
conditions power consumption when
testing with farcry was much the same
across the board all CPUs push total
system consumption to around 380 watts
here we see a 10% reduction in power
consumption we're moving from the 1600 X
to the 2600 X in our blender workload
that is an impressive improvement for
the 2600 X but even so it still consumes
21% more power than the idea seminar ok
then finally this time when testing with
handbrake we set the 2600 X actually
pushed total system consumption 7
percent higher than that of 1600 X and a
whopping 32% higher than the 8700 K okay
so we just saw a number of interesting
results as we saw in the day 1 reviews
despite a rather large clock speed
deficit the second generalize and CPUs
aren't often that far behind there Intel
rivals in application benchmarks and
here we see why that is when comparing
them clock the clock at 4 gigahertz in
application benchmarks such as Cinebench
r15 we see that the single core
performance is down just 3% but where
SMT is well leveraged aim D can be as
much as 4% faster we found that AMD was
3% slower in our corona benchmark and
much the same in our Excel IV rate and
video editing tests then while it was
15% slower and our handbrake test it was
also 8% faster for the PC market and
physics test of course there is still
the matter of gaming and I bet a few AMD
fans were hoping we could put most of
the gaming performance deficit down to
clock speed sadly though that isn't the
case one issue here is how AMD connects
its cause or rather for CCX modules
intel's ring bus is a low latency method
that always sees resources access to bio
the shortest path however as you add
more cause the Rings grow in size and
more rings are required to connect all
the cores and this sees efficiency go
out the window there's more to it but
basically Intel needed a method for
connecting large amounts of course like
28 of them for example at this core
count the mission to connect
architecture is superior however four
six eight and even ten core CPUs we
already know the mesh interconnect is an
inferior solution and this is why the
core i7 is 7800 X 78 20x + 17 900 X all
gets smoked by the 8700 K when it comes
to gaming this is because the 8700 K has
an average latency for about 40 nano
seconds between cores whereas the 700 X
is more like 70 to 80 nanoseconds the
rise in CPUs are a little more complex
as the cores within the CCX module have
a similar core to call latency to that
of the 8700 ok and this is regardless of
the ddr4 memory speed however once you
exit the CCX module the cortical latency
increases to around a hundred and ten
nanoseconds and that's with ddr4 30 to
200 memory the CCX to c6 core latency is
reduced with faster memories aimed is
infinity fabric is tied to the memory
clock rate and lower latency DRAM also
helps immensely another issue is the
games themselves almost all games are
designed to work on just a few cores and
only now are we starting to see some
effort made to try and break tasks up
into pieces so they can be run in
parallel
obviously prior to aim DS rise and
release games were designed and well
almost exclusively optimized for Intel
CPUs and that meant working with quad
cores that is slowly starting to change
now so rising gaming performance will
improve with time just don't expect it
to be wiping the floor with ring bus
CPUs any time soon anyway in terms of
IPC performance amy has certainly closed
up the gap and the improved cache
latency has also really helped there
certainly a number of benefits to buying
a second generalize and CPU over a
coffee like CPU so it is going to be
exciting to see how the battle unfolds
