today's video is a bit different from
the norm because i'll be introducing a
new team member to harbor unboxed which
i'm quite excited about it's going to
help reduce my workload you guys are
always saying I look very tired so
hopefully by bringing on Tim who works
at tech spot with me we've both been a
textbook for quite a while now so tim
has plenty of experience there but he's
going to help with some content that I'm
not currently covering so anyway Tim
tell us a bit about yourself yeah so
I've been working at tech spot alongside
Steve now for I think four and a half
years he obviously comes with a piece of
hardware stuff but I'm more on the
mobile side so I think on Hardware box
you'll be sent content on you know your
gaming laptops your ultra portable
smartphones and I think Steve you've
people be wanting some peripheral stuff
so yes yeah well be bringing that back
as well yeah along with displays and all
that sort of stuff so yeah an entirely
new sort of content for hardware box and
think it should be really awesome yeah
it'll be very good because I know a lot
of the harbour unbox fans that have been
watching the channel for a year or more
now loved all the peripheral stuff that
we were doing back when Matt was helping
with the channel or Matt was really the
whole face of the channel I was doing
all the filming behind the camera and
whatnot but yeah we did a lot of
peripheral reviews back then because
that was what Matt enjoyed doing me not
so much and but that's an area where tim
has a lot of experience and he can bring
a lot there so yeah the peripheral
reviews will be coming back
unfortunately Matt won't be coming back
for you guys that keeper asking he's
moved on to other things didn't want to
continue with the channel so he's handed
it all over to me we did start the
channel together so I know a lot of you
guys will be disappointed that Matt
isn't coming back and I'm very
disappointed but I'm very happy to have
Tim coming on to help me it's gonna be
really great for the channel help us
step up the content and the laptop stuff
is what I'm really excited to see
because gaming laptops and now good yeah
yeah you know I think two or three years
ago we're on you know even gtx 980 I
dipped behind you know a good gaming
desktop and these days with all the
Pascal stuff you can get a laptop it's
more powerful than my gaming desktop at
home it's crazy yeah well I mean even a
GTX 9
is still a very capable graphics card
and getting that in the form of a 1060
with massive power savings and you give
like a thousand bucks now are you s
yeah so basically going forward laptops
or gaming laptops are going to come
become very relevant yeah very exciting
and I know you guys are gonna start all
wanting to start see us covering those
on the channel so yeah the gaming
laptops will be exciting and in addition
to those as well like I said Tim will be
doing peripherals that's your headphones
keyboards mice and whatever else falls
under that heading and another thing as
well which we have sort of dabbled in
but haven't really covered it to the
degree that you expect from harbor unbox
with you know in-depth testing or
whatever it is mobile phones and that's
something Tim has a lot of experience
with yeah yeah I'm really big into the
mobile phone test you know I think a lot
of people on YouTube at the moment just
sort of use the phones you know in
everyday life and just saw a show a
couple of camera samples but you know I
go right into the benchmarking that I
think has been you know really good on
hardware and box for all these years and
you know battery testing performance
testing display testing I think mmm all
that content you'll be seeing so my
smartphone reviews hopefully star in the
next couple of months when all those
major releases start hitting yeah I'll
be looking for a new phone to find out
what is worth getting and you're
reminding me as well displays that's
another thing that to me is yeah I've
been sort of doubling a little bit and
trying to get you know down the testing
methodologies you know color calibration
and that sort of things so bringing all
that I think in the next couple weeks
I've actually got a modern sample come
and I think so hey yeah it should be
good yeah well that'll be great because
again monitors are another thing that
I'm pretty hopeless with I don't have a
lot of experience so yeah that's
something that will be good to bring to
the channel for sure because we
constantly get requests announces
monitors are really accelerating with
their tech you know yes don't HDR
monitors coming in next couple of months
which will be really exciting I think so
yeah yep yep and I have to admit I've
been left behind with that sort of stuff
and you've stayed on top of it so that
will be really cool for the channel and
you can get me up to speed
anyway so when the guys ask a few
questions I'll know what I'm talking
about ice add another thing that Tim is
very good at which I'm a bit slack with
is the social media side of things I do
a good job as you guys know of keeping
up with comments and chatting with you
guys in the comments section and
interacting with you guys and I enjoy
doing that but you know we've got our
Instagram Twitter Facebook and I'm not
as good on those so yeah I think I just
recently resurrected the hardware box
Facebook page I think you might have
seen that it was dormant for about three
or four months so I just jumped on board
and started helping out there and yeah
you'll see us on Twitter and Instagram
as well Hardware boxed on both of those
places so give us a like and follow on
all those relevant places and I'll be
chatting with you on some of those
places you can also follow me I'm also
an all three of those places at Tim
Schuster so I'm gonna make you have some
little text on the screen there so yeah
if I would definitely follow us on all
of those place and it should be a lot
more engagement from us on those fronts
yeah well now relevant on social media
oh cool all right so enough about what
Tim will be doing or hoping to do tell
us more about exactly what you'll be
doing in the next few weeks yes I've
been stone doing some testing on an msi
gt80 3 vr it's a massive laptop it's got
gtx 1080 SLI in it it's definitely the
most powerful laptop I've ever tested so
I think that should be probably the
first video that I'll be putting up on
Harborough box I've also been sent a 240
Hertz 1080p gaming monitor from a soos
so giving that a shot I've got a headset
review coming from HyperX and I think a
Corsair pre-built system will be being
sent last couple weeks hopefully and
yeah I think that's most of the plans
for me at least for the next month or so
whatever I can test in that time yeah
we're looking forward to covering some
of that stuff well it sounds like Tim's
gonna be very busy providing content for
you guys it's gonna help me because
there'll be a little more content each
week that I won't have to be producing
so I'll be able to focus more on those
benchmark videos and all that sort of
stuff so anyway that's yeah Tim will now
be coming on board helping me out it's
gonna be great
so that's all for this one I'm your host
Steve I'm your new host Tim I will catch
you guys soon
hey guys welcome back to harbor unboxed
know what let me some stuff to put at
the end of the video I think</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
