question alright welcome back to harbor
unboxed today is our monthly Q&amp;amp;A that
Tim and I do now once a month we did it
last month we're doing it this month so
it's now a monthly Q&amp;amp;A we will be doing
it from Tim studio so not my place we're
still setting up Tim she oh there might
be a little bit of echo with the audio
but hopefully it's not too bad so anyway
we've asked questions on Twitter on the
community section on YouTube we've asked
our patrons got a couple of good
questions that we're going to address so
let's get to it all right so the first
question comes from a discord chat that
you get through our patreon
subscriptions I guess from user revel
devil mm they asked do you guys have any
ideas or things you think might happen
to seperate the graphics card market
from miners to make everyone happy Heidi
Steve I thought about this a bit I don't
really have any great answer that will
probably solve the problem and I think
anyone does I think they would have to
make it first that if they want to I
suppose stop minors from using gaming
graphics cards and then come out some
other solution you'd have to have the
drivers detect mining and then if the
mining performance of the cars they
don't want to mine yeah which would be
pretty difficult I think to prevent
people from you know flashing the biases
and all that sort of thing but really if
they could prevent people from using
gaming cards for mining that allow
gamers to actually buy cards and use
them for games which is what everyone
wants yeah that's right so the there's
the hacking of the driver there but all
the firmware they don't have to make it
so the firmware is get certified by the
driver so there's like multiple levels
of security there so just if anything it
becomes less of a deterrent like it's a
lot of effort to hack a gaming card to
mine on and I suppose my
solution which probably isn't a great
solution for miners I'm thinking
thinking more out for the game√≠s yes I
don't know how keen nvidia and AMD will
be to actually shaft miners i can't
imagine that's true high on their to-do
list they may want to present that way
to the gaming market but i'd say they're
pretty happy with - buying their frights
but what option would be to make
accelerator type cards for mining it may
be better for mining more durable a
design to run 24/7 under heavy load and
probably don't have either any display
connectors or just one because you don't
need that for mining obviously the
disadvantage there is for the miners is
they're buying a card that is obviously
going to be used for mining and doesn't
have a resale value for gamers so if the
mining bubble does eventually burst or
whatever you can't just offload them and
the great thing for gamers there would
be they know if they're buying a card
and it's been absolutely flogged mine or
if it's been used for gaming yeah I
think that the resurvey is a big thing
this sort of dictates all of those
accelerated cards being less popular for
miners oh my god yeah so I think well I
personally do is have a card like a
regular consumer card that is gaming
only and uses some of those BIOS
protections that was just talking about
but then also have a card that is
unlocked for mining and gaming so that
you know miner once the mining market
crashed or something could still resell
these cards to game as if they want so
there's still resale value there but
then gamers have the ability to buy the
gaming only cards when no there's this
big influx of miners you know they'll be
availability of those cards and
something like that I think could work
really well have that jewel system I
think that's probably a more realistic
option to what I proposed yeah I think I
think that's something they could
definitely do and would make sense okay
the next question it comes from a Radeon
subreddit do you have high hopes for
rise in mobile or do you think the
competition from Nvidia or Intel is too
much and I'm gonna hand that one over to
Tim because that's very much up your
alley yes I from all the testing I've
been doing on rising mobile I think it's
really good like it's a really good ship
the problem comes when AMD sells a lot
of these 215 inch
systems or OMS decide to put them in 50
inch notebooks because that's where we
get the Intel CPUs being paired with
something like an nvidia MX 150 which is
a really popular sort of GT 1030 type
discrete GPU so when you get that combo
you know Intel Nvidia you know against a
performance we'd those start to be
really attractive and you know the
Verizon APU by itself it struggles a
little bit to compete there as well
whereas row I think it's going to be
really good and I have really high hopes
for its in the 13-inch notebooks because
in those notebooks there's not as much
space we don't see discrete GPUs in
there as often and Raisa Mobile is so
far ahead of Intel's
integrated graphics that it really makes
it it's a night and day difference for
things like gaming on something
hopefully on something like the horizon
720 700 use so once we start getting
those into those really thin and light
13-inch ultra portables where you can't
buy discreet GPUs that's where I think
rise and low bar will be really awesome
and will compete really strongly in fact
you almost obliterate until I would
think in that sort of market ok the next
question is from the community section
on YouTube and it's been asked by a boss
brown-sugar
how much risk am I taking by not
downloading the Intel kernel security
update well that's a good question many
people are asking that one have you only
thoughts on that oh well I think you
know the vulnerability is out in the
wild now it's known how to exploit it at
least in some way we're not security
experts or anything so it seems like
it's fairly difficult to exploit but you
know as soon as though that stuff's out
in the wild you know people are going to
be using this you know you might find
yourself you know going somewhere you
don't expect or something and they're
keylogging your passwords or your credit
card info so there's always a risk from
keeping that sort of thing unpatched
what do you reckon well I pretty much
agree with everything you said that
we're not security experts but what we
do know is that it's now a known
vulnerability and the risk of that it's
hard to say at this point but as Tim
says people will get better and
exploiting that vulnerability down the
track
it's yeah not something you want to have
on your system it's hard enough to keep
things secure as it is without having
known vulnerabilities yeah exactly can
you know password snooping and all the
things they can potentially do with this
so depends on what risk you want to take
it personally I would want to patch it
up to as being as secure as possible
alright so the next question comes from
Twitter from sand person interesting
username there is console gaming a
better experience per dollar right now
so I guess this is coming from you know
a person willing to build a PC but you
know it's running into all the problems
with GPU availability Ram pricing all
that sort of thing like funny stuff yeah
it's an interesting thing to think about
because a lot of the time what you want
to use a PC for is not necessarily what
you want to use a console for it's a
very different experience but you know
if you just want to get out there and
play games the latest triple-a titles or
whatever and you think you're burning a
mid range system just for games you
might in some cases be better suited to
one of the more powerful you know
consoles like Xbox 1x ps4 Pro they can
do a lot of good quality gaming on that
from your couch but at the same time you
know if you wanted to desk and you know
do that sort of PC like stuff you're not
going to get that from a console so yeah
it's a really interesting position to be
in at the moment what do you reckon yeah
well I have pretty much the same take on
it really I'm not anti console by any
means I make a couple of console jokes
oh I avenge my videos now and then for
me it's just a totally different thing
like I've played consoles with friends
and it's a really fun great experience
but it's not the type of gaming I prefer
to do most of the time yeah so like my
keyboard and mouse I like playing
real-time strategy games so if I want to
play a car racing game or something like
that then consoles great fun or just
casual gaming
but yeah it's almost like two different
sports
I find consoles and PCs I don't know why
there's always this big clash between
them because they're just so different
like yeah you either want that
experience or that one or a bit of both
so yeah as you said at the start if you
were thinking of buying a budget PC and
then you're like shows get a console
it's like well you were kind of looking
at doing something different to that so
it depends on what experience you want
my suppose yeah okay next question is
from Jason on Twitter will you ever have
more budget orientated video or I
suppose do budget orientated videos on
anything
CPUs dear users laptops well we do
pretty much every budget CPU and GPU our
cover at length like we did a lot of
stuff on the G 45 6000 guys just taught
me to get sick of that but it was a
great buy horizon 3 we covered
extensively and then even I did a 20
plus game comparison the rx 550 and GT
1030 so I've done lots of budget stuff
we are very heavily focused on value and
hardware unbox it's not just about 1080
is by those you know we try to work out
what is the best bang for your buck and
trying to cover all scenarios and look
at it from many different angles and by
our perspectives
I think budget monitors would be cool
and even gaming like yeah it's
definitely something that I've been
looking into is getting more of the
budget stuff as well as getting some of
the stuff from the Korean brands of
people always talking about you really
interesting you review those the problem
with a lot of review samples for
displays you know laptops smartphones
whatever is that companies are a lot
more willing in those markets to push
their high-end products so it's a lot
harder to get your hands on the budget
stuff and you know we can ask for them
and you know but they're always trying
to push their latest and greatest you
know $900 monitor or whatever so yeah
it's something we're definitely looking
into definitely this year I'm hoping to
get in a lot more of the budget stuff
because that's what you guys are more
interested in I just can be a little bit
difficult working out with the companies
to try and get that stuff in alright so
the next question comes from Twitter
again this is from a user net I'm
definitely going to be butchering here
apologies that shravan Parthasarathy
that's a good as I guess I'm gonna get
for that one some thoughts on buying FX
chips right now stay what do you reckon
on the FX chips I assume they mean AMD
FX Oh
yeah we've touched on this affair in the
channel whatever I bashed these are
upset FX artists so I am sorry but it is
also my opinion they're rubbish chips
and you should have never bought them
sorry they were just never good they
really were every button they're
definitely not good today if you have a
bought a Sandy Bridge 2500 okay or 2600
okay you can still be using that today
very power efficient excellent gaming
performance and also good at other
things as well like productivity
workloads whereas the FX chip is just
really power-hungry useless at gaming
modern core i3 is G 45 60 you know gives
the well for module 8 core FX chips are
real run for their money basically
putting into like car terms an FX chips
got like the power of a Volkswagen Polo
actually they're pretty zippy maybe
that's maybe that's you yeah and it's
got the fuel consumption of like a GDR
with a whole a fuel tank looks like
that's no they know you know they've got
no performance and they're just so
power-hungry it's insane okay the next
question again comes from Twitter and
this one is Albert cos Aras hopefully I
got that right sorry if I didn't how big
of an impact do you think Volta is going
to have on consumer grade GPUs I suppose
we should probably just answer this by
saying we have no idea about Volta we
don't know any more than pretty much you
guys reading the news stories and
whatever rumors or things get leaked out
so I don't know what to expect in terms
of performance I don't know what how and
video are gonna go about it
they're pretty much is competing with
themselves at this point so we'll have
to wait and see basically we're may
would you say if they're gonna release
something yeah this being rumors that
they're gonna know something at GTCC in
my okay but they're rumors so you know
you're never really sure yeah I think
it's just you know it's the same as all
the previous Nvidia launches really they
come out there competing largely with
themselves at the high-end Kazaam but is
more in the mid-range and they just
released new graphics cards that are
fairly priced considering their monopoly
on the high ends they've got you know
more performance low
consumption you can get more performance
for your dollar that sort of been what
Envy is doing I think we're going to see
exactly the same thing with voltar to be
honest yeah well it has to be attractive
to the consumers to buy otherwise
they're not going to buy it and they
want to see strong sales and yeah I mean
the way it works for us is we might hear
some rumors and things like that that we
can kind of confirm order but I mean
really nothing concrete and then it's
usually like two or three weeks before
release and video ill say we've got a
priority we're sending it out signed the
NDA we sign that and that's
non-disclosure agreement so we can't say
anything else based on the information
they give us and then the car will
arrive we usually get the review guide
about the same time that tells us pretty
much everything we need to relay that
information to you guys we do all the
benchmark all the testing and sometimes
we don't even know the price that
they're gonna set to doing this till
like the day before sometimes like it's
an insane or short period of time that
we get to then write a conclusion it's
very difficult video because for the
written stuff I can do everything and
leave my conclusion and sort of guess
where I think it's going to be priced
and make a few notes based on that and
then when you get the price finish it up
but for video
you can't even film it till you have the
price because it changes so much that's
right so you can't really fill the
conclusion go so we've got to the point
where now is it good or not I don't know
we read the comments below when I get
the price so you've just gotta wait in
film at last minute okay luck in me one
the top uploaded comment on the
community section of our youtube channel
and the question was what was your job
before YouTube so sounds like a lot of
our viewers are interested in what we
did before YouTube well I think I've
said this before on the channel but I'll
quickly cover it started YouTube just
over a year ago now before that I did
text spot for 10 years or something and
I started my own tech site before that
so and then before that after Coles
packing shelves for about a year and a
half and that was during school so yeah
during school got a part-time job then
started my own tech site then got a job
at tech spot
and now the YouTube channel yeah it's
pretty similar for me to be honest
pretty similar I'm a bit younger than
you Steve so not much time to be working
at XY but I've been working at export
for about five years and then before
that I was working at the Microsoft site
new in back in the day course often use
and then that was when I was in school
that was sort of my part-time job in
school just kind of kono so you just
skip Kohl's dude you skipped all the
cold stuff someone makes a good choice
while I was right enough all my tech
stuff cuz I was always really into that
sort of thing so yeah yeah it's just
been doing this for a while now and you
know see that was at uni before got my
master of engineering but not gonna use
that cuz this is a really good job for
you won't have to use it alright the
next question is also from YouTube from
the user mass destroyer will we ever see
a behind-the-scenes video or how a
hardware unbox video is made I answer
that is yes on our patreon page if you
support us through the appropriate tier
we provide behind the scenes videos
we've got one of those coming up you'll
give us sort of two of your stereo a
little bit we're gonna have plenty more
of those videos coming we will be doing
some stuff on how these videos are made
so yeah some big benchmarks that should
be really good yes yes I go sign up to
patreon today alright another question
from YouTube this time from atashi you
see her I've read in butcher that one
too badly can you use aim D overdrive to
undeveloped the Rison 2500 you like
until x2 Intel chips I get this question
a lot in summer video sunrise my were
about either underclocking or
overclocking rising and as far as I'm
aware you can't aim the overdrive is not
a feature that's including the drivers
for rising mobile you can't go into that
section of Radeon software anything at
the moment just looking around as well
looks like no one else has been able to
overclock what underclock these chips
obviously they're very rare in the
market so it's not a lot of testing that
can be done but as far as aimed your
overdrive support for overclocking or
underclocking it's just doesn't exist at
the moment alright next question is from
YouTube and it has been asked by dabs
gaming what's the longest you've spent
benchmarking in a single
run like total hours spent in a row
benchmarking huh you're the benchmark
master what's your record here I don't
know when they go that long I don't even
want to know up they'd be plenty that
were at least 16 hours for sure just in
the last few months I would have done
plenty of those I try to split them up
like do a bit of benchmarking a bit of
something else and have a few videos on
the go but sometimes you just go like
well I suppose the recent one would have
been the security stuff the make sure
there was I remember I drove to one of
the local computer stores which is about
half an hour or an hour from my place
grabbed the seuss motherboard the Zen
370 board got home tested all of did a
fresh install windows install all the
applications and games and that probably
just test that was four or so hours
roughly I don't know I didn't really pay
attention then I applied the meltdown
update redid all of that so at least
another four hours then applied the BIOS
update so again another four hours and
then look to all the data I'd gathered
and there was a few weird things like
you get so then you go recheck those and
then sometimes that means uninstalling
updates or rolling back I think I rolled
back the boss then updated it rolled it
back two times updated half-a-dozen
times and that was that would have been
well over 16 hours of straight testing
and then I've got the video out a day or
so later and then Verizon was another
big one rise and seven I think I didn't
sleep for two or three days on that one
my party I had to go that it couldn't
get it working and it turned out it's
all biased issues all right the final
question for our Q&amp;amp;A video for January
comes from Adrian gaming on YouTube they
asked would you take a chance on an
obscure motor company eg via tech for a
product that's a great price and on
paper has great specs so the bottom line
is yeah you in some cases you really
should be looking at those products
because the panel's themselves are not
made by the you know L cheaper companies
they're all known brands that produce
them for all sorts of companies like a
optronics samsung sharp a lot of these
companies produce them for
all the brands so a lot of those el
cheapo monitors have you know the exact
same panel is a more expensive ones just
trying to find the good quality panels
for a lower price but the same time you
can run into a number of issues with the
cheaper brands things like warranty and
support can be non-existent so if you're
really wondering about your warranty and
being able to send your monitor back mmm
those are things you probably won't get
as well from those cheaper brands you
know things like build quality
calibration around the box you probably
won't get so and the on screen display
can be dodgey and those sort of things
so if you're after just the panel you
will tend to get that from the cheaper
brands but all those other things you'll
probably end up sacrificing yes the
power supplies in the monitor and things
like that yeah yeah yeah so it
definitely comes down to probably the
big one as you say is warranty I think
yeah who talked about this the other day
and I was saying it really comes down to
how much you are saving yeah exactly
if it's a massive saving Shaun and you
know when I was looking at TVs I was
like the Samsung TV was two thousand
dollars for example and the same panel
you know cheaper brand was like a
thousand dollars and it looked very much
the same so it's like well for by the
thousand dollar one and the Samsung
warranties only two years anyway if you
don't buy extended warranty and all that
and so I think goes two years and then
dies well I could potentially just buy
another one I will have been where I
would have been or in two years you can
get something better because that sort
of technology moves quickly but if you
only say like I say if you're only
saving a small percentage of what the
known brand is and it's shy away from
that because if you go into your local
computer store or whatever it might be a
local hi-fi store and you buy a monitor
take it home and the power supply dies
and it or something wrong you can
usually just walk back in off the street
and say this is broken and they'll help
you out whereas these ones that come
from China from an eBay seller or
whatever it's like good luck yeah and if
you do send it back it'll cost you a lot
to send a morrow about yeah like
hundreds of dollars of postage to get
those things and that's a massive risk
in itself because I've had situations I
think it was a tablet and it was $50 to
send that back and though it's never
heard anything yeah so and they were
like meant to be a reputable seller on
eBay
had really good but after you've already
given feedback yeah you've had you know
thirty days and it's been good so yeah
it's kind of like a gamble if you're
willing to risk that money you may come
off with a great product you could buy
four things from them have a great
experience or you might buy once and
have a terrible experience yeah so it's
it's risky but it certainly can get some
good deals and some really shocking
deals too so yeah just have to be
careful alright so that brings us the
end of our January look questions that
we got from all of our places so thanks
to everyone for saying those in and
continue to support the channels always
really nice to get so many questions
that we have to choose from through
these sort of videos we will I guess be
doing another one of these come next
month we'll get together again should be
this time next month do some more Q&amp;amp;A
stuff and ask for your questions once
again so I guess that's it for this
video
got anything else to say Steve that's it
I think that's yeah you've covered it
all well we've hopefully addressed all
the questions and you're satisfied with
our answers and you're happy or excited
to see us do it again yeah so I guess
we'll be catching you next time
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
