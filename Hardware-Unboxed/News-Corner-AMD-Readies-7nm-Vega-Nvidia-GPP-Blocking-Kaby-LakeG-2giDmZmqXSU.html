calm design your own custom snap backs
and hats
thanks to cap based for sponsoring this
video and welcome to the hardware unbox
news corner today we've got all sorts of
news topics to cover including a ton of
AMD related stories Intel indirectly
confirming there's e3 90 and X 399
chipsets new Samsung 970 Pro and Evo
SSDs Corsair potentially getting into
the monitor market and more so let's
kick things off with news of new AMD
graphics cards during AMD's latest
earnings call CEO dr. Lisa surah field
that the company already has a working
prototype of a seven nanometer Vega GPU
in the Radeon Technology Group labs this
fits with AMD's roadmap that placed 7
nanometre Vega for launch in 2018 and
indeed Lisa soon mentioned that AMD is
on track to sample this product to
customers later this year
unfortunately for game is the first
seven nanometer Vega product will be a
Radeon Instinct graphics processor for
AI and machine learning these first
professional cards will likely use the
GPU codename vaguer 20 which rumors say
brings more double precision compute
power more memory bandwidth and more HBM
to to the table while the codenamed Vega
20 is a bit confusing considering we
have Vega 56 and 64 gaming GPUs it is
the successor to Vega 10 which is the
GPU family that includes vac is 64 and
56 so from all reports Vega 20 will be
AMD's refreshed high-end cheaper your
product it's hard to know if aim D will
release a seven nanometer Vega GP for
gamers or non professional workloads
this year as the company is only talking
about Radeon instinct with seven
animator Vega at this point I'm not
tending towards an O at this point we'll
probably have to wait for Navi in 2019
but you never know normally I don't
bother covering financial results is
they're super boring but I think this
quarters revenue report for AMD is
pretty interesting and delivers some
long-awaited good news for AMD investors
the key thing to note here is revenue
for q1 20:18 was 1.65 billion up
1.18 billion in the same quarter a year
ago this allowed amb to actually make an
operating profit of 120 million and a
net profit of 81 million which is far
better than the loss they occurred a
year ago a lot of these gains are due to
an enormous rise in revenue for AMD's
computing and graphics division up from
just five hundred and seventy three
million to 1.12 billion year on year a
lot of this would be down to a and be
launching Rison and completely turning
around their cpu department though
strong sales of Radeon cars would have
helped as well it's also important to
note this doesn't yet include revenue
from a and B second gen rise and
processes so no doubt next quarter will
be similarly impressive from AMD you
might have seen around the second gen
rising launch some stories reporting
that aim DS official warranty Verizon
stated that the warranty is only valid
if you use the included box heatsink
slash fan obviously this seems pretty
unreasonable so when it was pointed out
to AMD that updated their warranty terms
to allow third party coolers that
conform with ambhi's official
specifications a minor change but it is
an important one for rising buyers go
ahead and use whatever supported cool
you like and don't worry about your
warranty being voided may as well keep
talking about the AMD news stories of
the week this one relating to the
company's new combat crates not a
particularly exciting announcement
farmers but I have seen it discussed in
a few places basically these crates
bundle a first gen rise in process and a
be 350 motherboard together and in some
cases add in a Radeon rx 580 GPU and
then tech crunch the numbers and these
crates don't really provide a
significant discount over the current
retail prices of the individual
components though they do give you
pricing stability and also the ability
to actually buy an rx 580 GPU it's
definitely worth reiterating the crates
include processes like the risin 5 1600
and risin 7 1700 so if you were
expecting second gen rising you won't
find it here
it does seem mostly like away for AMD to
flush out remaining first gen rise in
stock while bundling them with in-demand
graphics cards if you're interested the
combat crates are available through
Amazon now final AMD news story for this
week the company has launched the Rison
320 200 GE and rise in 521
hundred G these are 35 watt variants of
AMD's Raven Ridge ap use with integrated
Vega GPUs the only real difference
between these and the Nani models being
slightly reduced CPU clock speeds the
2200 GE drops from a 3.5 gigahertz base
and 3.7 gigahertz boost to a 3.2
gigahertz base at 3.6 gigahertz boost
while the 2400 GE goes from 3.6 and 3.9
gigahertz to 3.2 and 3.8 gigahertz these
new low-power ApS should hit the market
soon new Intel rapid storage
technologies drivers and their release
notes have indirectly revealed Intel's
upcoming z3 90 and X 399 chipsets I
think everyone at this point already
assumed or knew these chipsets were
coming in the future but Intel's driver
release notes do give a bit of extra
information on what we can expect said
390 and X 399 will both use Intel's
Canon point HPC H which is already sold
in a variety of schools that include be
360 H 370 and H 310 but not said 370
this makes Z 390 essentially an upgraded
version of zebb 370 that uses this newer
chip as expected as for features it
looks like Z 390 will be similar to 8
370 but with overclocking support and
increase to 24 pcie 3.0 lanes and
support for an extra rst PS a storage
device interestingly an and tech also
points out that the X 399 platform will
only be validated for Sky like X to
begin with so it's unclear where the KB
Lake X will work with X 399 when the
chipsets launch ninth generation Canon
like you series parts will use a
different chipset called chemin point LP
it seems like every company these days
wants to get into the monitor market
this week news broke that Corsair are
potentially developing gaming monitors
to go along with everything else they
currently make a job posting was spotted
that asks for a product manager for the
display product line so it seems Corsair
are gearing up to launch a monitor or
two in the coming years this is
basically all the information we have on
this at this stage and it could still be
a while before we see the first course
air monitors hit the market
speaking of monitors this
week Philips announced the momentum 43
which at 43 inches apparently still
qualifies as a monitor anyway it has a
3840 by 2160 MVA panel and crucially it
is display HDR 1000 certified in other
words it supports a peak brightness of
1000 nits to go along with the 4,000 to
1 contrast ratio and 97.6% DCI p3 color
space reproduction Philips even says the
monitor can sustain 720 nits of
brightness it which is pretty impressive
this monitor really isn't meant for
gaming as it has just a 60 Hertz refresh
though it does have adaptive sync
support you also get ambi glow mood
lighting that projects suitable lighting
from the back of the monitor using RGB
LEDs the momentum 43 6 m6 which is the
prime name for this monitor will cost
one thousand dollars and should be
available in late July
Samsung has launched new high end SSDs
in the 970 pro and 970 Evo these are
both PCIe nvme drives in an MDOT tube
form factor with the pro available in
512 Deacon 1 terabyte capacities while
the Evo comes in 256 K through 2 2
terabyte capacities Samsung is even
upgraded than 970 Evo to an impressive
5-year warranty
looking over PC perspectives review it's
clear that these drives offer impressive
performance thanks to a new phoenix
controller you get roughly a 10%
performance gain in general compared to
the 960 line and that allows these SSDs
to deliver class-leading performance the
970 Pro in particular is extremely fast
as you'd expect given the price tag
you'll be able to purchase these drives
on May 7th and I highly recommend you
check out the pc perspective review
links in the description final news
topic for this week and this is
something a few of you have pointed out
to me in the comments in the last few
videos a report from notebook checks
suggests that the notorious nvidia
geforce partner program is to blame for
slow adoption of intel's impressive
vocabulary processes among laptop
manufacturers as it currently stands kb
lake tree has only been featured in a
handful of procs a couple of laptops
from HP and Dell a mini PC from chewy
and of course Intel's own nuts other
companies like msi gigabyte or soos a
search
and so forth who are known to make both
gaming laptops and many pieces heaven as
yet announced anything with cable a key
inside notebook checks citing three
independent sources claims invidious GPP
terms are preventing some companies from
using cable Hg it's no surprise in video
would want to stop companies from using
cable Hg with its integrated AMD Vega
graphics instead of an Intel Plus Nvidia
combination considering the discussion
around the anti-competitive nature of
the GPP the story does make sense
although as with anything related to the
GPP it is hard to get any concrete
information on the record about what is
going on that's it for this week's news
