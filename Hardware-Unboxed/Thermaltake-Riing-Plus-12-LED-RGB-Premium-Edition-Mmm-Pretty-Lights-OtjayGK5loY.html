if you missed it earlier in the week I
check out MSI's new Z 270 gaming m7
which overall was a pretty cool
motherboard I was a little disappointed
that the board's looks to priority over
performance in some areas and it seems
like many the RGB grades got the better
of MSI on that one but hey we can't give
them too much of a hard so I'm they
aren't the only brand to embrace the RGB
madness today I have a product in hand
from thermaltake that aims to take RGB
fans to the next level if I'm being
perfectly honest I wasn't that impressed
with their original ring RGB fans
they're a bit bland the fans themselves
worked well at least when it came to
their primary function moving air the
controller wasn't software controllable
though so you had to gain access to the
inside of your PC case every time you
wanted to change the fan speed or
lighting effects
so to recap I wanted to see better
lighting effects from Thermaltake and
the ability to tinker with the fans from
within windows they did release the
premium edition series last year which
featured an upgraded controller for
software control the fans themselves
though still lack that wow factor when
it came to the lighting this is where
these new ring plus RGB premium edition
fans really step up their game
the lighting is considerably more
impressive and this really makes for
some great effects what's cool about
this is thermaltake hasn't shifted focus
solely to the flashy stuff quality is
still key here the fans feature 9
scooped or compression Blazers they
technically refer to to maximize airflow
and static pressure along with hydraulic
bearings so the ring plus fans are the
real deal thermaltake has also added
anti-vibration pads at the mounting
points on the fan and these reduce noise
created by vibration speaking of noise
the fan is said to operate at a maximum
of 24 decibels when running at it to
limit which is 1600 rpm and at this
speed the fan moves a pretty impressive
48 cubic feet of air per minute the fans
come in packs of three and four now only
120 millimeter models are available the
package includes a new digital
controller which supports up to 5 fans
and these can be daisy chained with up
to 16 controllers in total for a maximum
eighty fans feeding 80 fans into a
single case is physically impossible and
I know this because the tower hundred
can't do it and if any case could it
would be that anyway if you did somehow
managed to install 80 fans the
thermaltake software would allow you to
control them all simultaneously apart
from the little issue of finding a case
that can have 80 of these 120 millimeter
fans there is the pricing hurdle now
this 3-pack that I have here is priced
at 110 u.s. or 130 Aussie so 27 packs
times 130 ozzie and you're looking at
spending about $3500 on the fans the
point is being that you could
realistically link up two or three
controllers and then conveniently
control them all using the provided
software for those wondering the new
controller is not compatible with the
ordering RGB fans which is a bit
disappointing for those wondering the
controller connects to the PC using an
internal USB 2.0 header which is kind of
nice and it makes very clean install
anyway this time around the lighting is
incredible and Thermaltake has certainly
made some great strides here the fans
now offer sixteen point eight million
color lighting with twelve different
effect modes and again they are now
software controllable the software is
cleaning design and functions very well
it's also a lightweight download at a
little over 20 megabytes the software
allows the user to save a number of
different profiles and customization
here for the lighting effects is truly
impressive throwing these in my recent
the tower 900 build looked amazing and
I'm certainly going to be hitting up
Thermaltake for another pack to install
on the other three hundred sixty
millimeter radiator overall the thermal
take ring plus twelve LED RGB
premutation fans are a big step up from
the previous model and they really are
amongst the best RGB fans I've ever seen
of course the only issue here is the
price at 110 dollars EOS $130 ozzie they
are a bit pricey Corsairs competing HD
120 millimeter series which also comes
in a 3-pack with the controller is
currently retailing for just $90 EOS so
hopefully Thermaltake can be a bit more
competitive on the pricing soon that
said though I should point out that the
Corsair models don't offer software
control with the HD series so this is a
big leg up for Thermaltake and
probably help justify the price premium
for most other than that these things
are awesome and I'm going to continue
referring to them as these things
because saying the product name in full
again will tire me out anyway I can't
wait to fully stock of this beast with a
few more of them it's really going to
look cool let me know what you guys
think about thermal takes flashing you
RGB fans are these something you hope to
feature in your next build I'm your host
Steve and I'll catch on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
