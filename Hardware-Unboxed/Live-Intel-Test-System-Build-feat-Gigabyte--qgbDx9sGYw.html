second time second time we're doing this
dream hopefully it's actually working
this time not quite sure what was going
on the first time with the audio issues
but Steve says at least last time that
the audio is fine so I'm going to take
his word for it and let us know in the
comments if the audio still isn't fine
because that would be a bit crap but
hopefully this first time the second
time will be the golden time so thanks
everyone for joining us thank you to
those who are also listening to this
stream or watching the replay of it
later once it's a sort of finished and
you might be wondering what is going on
well firstly we were supposed to start
half an hour ago so thanks to those who
are waiting around what we're actually
gonna be doing today is building an
Intel test system on this live stream so
the thing that we were sort of doing a
couple of weeks ago on the channels I
built an AMD Rison test system it was
the risin 520 600 X slash Verizon 720
700 X a couple of cool corsair stuffs
and cool gigabyte stuff went into that
build and obviously what I also need at
the same time not just an AMD system but
also having an Intel system so we've
partnered with gigabyte we've partnered
with Intel and we partner with the
wonderful people PC case key to do some
building PC building and people in the
chat sounding saying the sound sounds
good so yes that's nice stuff so alright
you might have seen some logos in the
corner that's because this video has
been brought to us in major partner with
gigabyte who's on the other side there
and the main thing that we'll be showing
off in this video and the main sort of
centerpiece of the build that we've got
here is the new Zed 370 or ultra gaming
Wi-Fi board and this is a particularly
interesting board because this
particular one comes with integrated
intel octane memory you get 32 gig built
in to the one of the MDOT two slots or
whatever the slot is that it uses I
we've seen a fair few bits and pieces on
obtained before and sort of the ability
for it to accelerate your if you're
mainly hard drive
storage you can use obtained to sort of
accelerates loading times and that sort
of thing and you know gigabyte
approaches um like you want to check
this out I'm like you know sure why not
we haven't done a lot of stuff with
octane before I'll be interesting to see
where some of the performance claims
that Intel says about octane turn out to
be true
we've seen some things about how it you
know speeds up loading time so we'll see
how that goes we're not actually gonna
be testing it today but we're just using
the latest and greatest motherboard
there is a version of this motherboard
that does not have obtain memory with it
if your interest in buying it without
that but octane is also a feature if you
want it
the other cool thing that we have of
course we've got all the components down
here we're using the gigabyte geforce
gtx 1070 TI again this will be familiar
to you if you saw our livestream
well-known our live stream but our
original video on the AMD test system we
originally used this I swapped it out
for Vegas 64 to do some free sync to
testing freed up this card I thought you
know why not got it available I'll use
it we also if you of course core i7 8700
K wouldn't be an Intel test system if we
weren't using I guess their flagship CPU
for now hopefully we'll be able to
overclock that up to around you know
that five gigahertz + mark at at some
point so yeah hopefully so far
everything's been going fine those are
the main components that we will be
using big thanks to gigabyte and Intel
for providing those and helping us out
with the stream and look at this we have
also got this second camera here so we
can show off some more stuff in a bit
more detail using testing out some IP
camera stuff here with this second
stream so interesting to have I guess
two camera angles going on at the moment
okay so we also have a bunch of other
stuff the guys at PC kasky helped us out
to provide all the other components that
we're using for this build and we really
want to thank them for that because you
know it's difficult sometimes to get
these parts but they're really pulled
through with us definitely check them
out if you're in Australia they are our
favorite retail PC case gear calm so
we've got a whole bunch of other stuff
so people were asking earlier in the
chat about team tee force or team force
or whatever their brand name is called
tee forces on the packaging I think it's
team
we have got some components from them to
show off and you can see our now low FPS
camera as people are talking about here
then we do have some team T Force
Nighthawk RGB Ram we've got 32 gig ddr4
3000 in this particular kit it's got a
really strange design I reckon in terms
of it's sort of weird angular sort of
thing we'll see how that RGB looks in
the particular build but that's what
we're currently using at the moment and
we've also got their SSD on our super
low FPS camera here which is 256 gig
Saito Drive nothing too fancy where you
normally swap out our drives and our
test systems with yes we normally try to
swap out these drives in our test
systems with the drives that we use
across all of our you know testing and
that sort of thing so for a boot drive
doesn't matter too much but we have got
that stuff from t4 so big thanks to them
for sending that stuff out for the power
supply we have be quiet straight power
11 now this PSU is oh yeah the the
solid-state drive is RGB I think it
definitely has some Ora sync features
and stuff on it so the person that was
yeah commenting about that is definitely
an RGB SSDs
look I don't know it sounds like an
interesting product the be quiet
straight power 11 this product is so new
that if you check it out on Amazon it
doesn't even have a picture yet on the
page so definitely a very new product
from them eight 80 plus gold 650 watt
pretty much the standard stuff that
you'd asked for and sort of a tested
something for cable management so we'll
be checking this beast out in the stream
and sort of seeing how that goes with
the rest of our testing we also have for
cooling another piece of gear from be
quiet we have their silent loop 280 so
this is their to 80 millimeter radiator
closed loop liquid cooler of course this
would be cooling at eighty 700 K and of
course thanks to the guys in from PC KP
for selling all of this out
but it doesn't stop there because we
have even more stuff we have fantex have
sent out a bunch of RGB stuff we have
their RGB strip in black gloss of RGB
but it's just black the base color I've
got that there we've got their digital
age
B controller that will be plugging it
all into and we also have three fans
sort of shroud so these are really
interesting they're digital
RGB frames so that you sort of put
around your non RGB fans to give them
RGB if you really want RGB so lots of
RGB stuff in this build to the
motherboard has tons of RGB the memory
the SSD even the fans everything will be
RGB at the moment so if someone asks
here hey I have a question what do you
think about this ramp OC so you've got
CL ten one point six five volts at
twenty one thirty three Corsair
Vengeance there's an XMP at 1600
megahertz I will leave that one to Steve
to answer because that will definitely
be one of the questions that he is more
familiar with that sort of thing having
done recently done that overclocking
video on the channel if you haven't
tested seen that definitely go check
that out as well okay so oh and the
final thing is we also would be quiet
dark bass 700 down there I'm not going
to bring it out just yet because it is
pretty big it will take up a lot of
space but that'll be the main but of
course the main case there's only one
case in a PC field so that's the sort of
thing that we're putting all of these
components in and yeah so basically if
you're following the stream so far the
stream we're going to be going through
pretty much the whole built so we're not
really sure how long this will take
could be a couple of hours so just
joining in for a bit of a ride and have
a bit of fun there will be giving
calling Steve about halfway through
giving him chatting Tim a little bit on
skype will be checking in with him I
guess hopefully that works because we
did test it yesterday and it worked
about knowing our success doing this
stream today it probably won't work but
hopefully we can get that up and running
in a couple of hours time someone asks
in the chat Coco FAFSA asks you should
talk about how inaccurate game
requirements are yes I really agree
about the game requirements thing I
think now we're starting to see a few
more game developers say like you know
games are you know 1080p ultra you get
you need to use this hardware to get
1080p or tree you need this hardware for
4k 60fps and that sort of thing I think
that's hopefully where the industry is
moving with
- that sort of thing but yeah it
definitely needs to be some sort of
standard or something so you can sort of
say you know the recommended
requirements give you that 1080p 60 or
1080p 120 or whatever people are
targeting at the moment yeah so I
totally agree about the the system
requirement sort of thing let's put some
of this stuff away and get into the
actual building of the system because we
need to clear out some space here we
need the 8700 K don't need the RGB stuff
until a little bit from now don't need
that just yet don't need this just yet
so some fun stuff and yeah I see Steve
is joined in the chat there he should
hopefully hopefully be able to respond
to some of your questions as well so if
you have stuff for him and specifically
he'll be checking out the chat as well
and while I'm sort of building our check
over here from time to time Chase says
you should overclock your cpu to 5
gigahertz definitely we're hoping to
achieve 5 gigahertz with this particular
sample we were going to see how this
performed earlier when Steve did his you
know he got a whole bunch of CPS I think
it was 10 from PC case gear to sort of
see how that was performing and sort of
see you know what sort of differences
you can get between the retail samples
but this one was actually provided by
Intel as opposed to PC case keys so if
it's one of those golden review samples
we'll certainly find out after the
stream when I start overclocking this
system greetings from Costa Rica oh jeez
amazing to see where people watch
hardware box some around the world we
really appreciate all the support around
the globe and apologies to the people
who are in the time zones where this
video is really terrible to watch I
think it's in Europe at the moment this
is beyond midnight so sorry to you guys
we will be changing up a few of our live
streams in the future so that people all
around the world will be able to watch
at sensible times bob says Lane Tim take
the heat yeah that's definitely true
Steve he yeah it didn't want to come out
for this one I think is probably for the
best because then both of us would be
taking heat for that fire at the start
of the video rustiest says is it correct
to assume we're heading out to Computex
which is why you're not on stream I
assume that's for Steve yes we're both
heading out to Computex we leave on
Saturday evening and there'll be a real
blast we hope to do a live stream there
as well and that should be really really
fun I think
Gabrielle asks Steve where are you why
not in the video we'll be chatting to
him later in this particular video we'll
be heading hitting up hitting him up on
skype so know how you guys love stuff
that's in packages in the unpackaging
the sort of stuff all of this stuff I
haven't taken out of the box I didn't
free look at it on before so it's all a
bit of an interesting thing to see how
this stuff is going so this is the board
that we've got here these said 370 ultra
gaming and you can see the integral
octane stick that they've got here in
the sort of center we can use that a low
FPS camera for this I reckon change this
over here so you can see there that the
Intel op down memory is fixed into the
center you can remove it if that's
something that you weren't after but
again you should just buy the ball that
doesn't have obtained memory integrated
into it yeah a fairly standard board you
know it's got all your USB ports it has
USB type-c USB 3.1 gen2 type-c and
type-a on this board plenty of the usual
stuff that you'd expect from a gigabyte
board and also lots of RGB as well so
certainly a very interesting board that
we will be putting the CPU in and of
course I think they have got to just
their usual stuff we probably will need
a SATA cable let's take that out we'll
need the i/o shield as well I do quite
like the Wi-Fi solution on there I've
been using the x4 70 board with the test
system and using their attitude 11ac
Wi-Fi that's integrated these boards and
it works really well so you know not
quite at the level of Ethernet that we
typically use but certainly their Wi-Fi
these days is getting to a point where
it's actually only somewhat usable
all right let's now we're using proper
PC building sort of requirements in that
we are not using any anti-static gear so
for all those people that say yeah
you're definitely interested you're
probably right but just for the moment
probably not something that we're doing
at the moment okay so I might need my
trusty box color Steve is meant to be
getting me one of those cool knives but
it hasn't quite happened just yet so
handy box cutter is something that
typically like to use over here factory
sealed and everything how about that
brand new core i7 8700 K of course for
those of you who didn't join into the
stream live that's fine now I have to
ask you guys in the chat all Intel CPUs
and AMD CPUs come with these little
stickers that you get in the back of the
instruction manual do you guys attach
this sticker to your system or do you
just throw that away I'm always curious
to know what people do with that sort of
thing so let us know do you put the
sticker on your system when you're
building okay core i7 8700 k let's use
the low FPS camera here you go brand-new
out-of-the-box and that's a really
crappy camera that we've got there so
wonderful stuff going on there chase
says have you have you heard about 4k
144 Hertz monitors yes hopefully we'll
be able to test one of those soon mm
u.s. makes them probably not something
that everyone will buy but certainly
something that some of you will be
interested in a sort of that high-end
model that will last you quite a while
so it seems like some people are saying
no some people put on their keyboard
some people attach it to their case some
people throw it away
only twelve-year-old girls use stickers
that's a bit of a burn there from
whoever said that I certainly don't put
the sticker on my systems I like to keep
the case nice and clean but go into
people's places that have got them and
sometimes you see people putting them so
all right let's put the good old CPU
do the old line up the triangle into the
corner the plastic retention bit has
popped off CPUs in looking all nice were
already underway with actually doing
some in the building and on the second
stream that has actually worked so
thanks to all of you guys who love some
who are joining in on the stream all
right let's put the RAM in as well
team force round it's interesting this
brand I hadn't heard of it before sort
of earlier this year when we started
doing some stuff with T force should you
a really relatively new player in the
sort of memory and storage sort of
division so certainly an interesting
thing to sort of see how this round goes
but they do offer a range of products
actually you know ddr4 3030 200 they've
got RGB kits they've got non RGB kits so
certainly something worth checking out
and they've got some really aggressive
really aggressive design to this
particular these particular tins it's
like very angular it's got the RGB sort
of I don't know what you call that sort
of a light bar it goes through both the
top and also the side so I guess if you
get some side vision of that you'll be
able to see that RGB ninis sort of
coming through so these are CL 16 to 8
gig sticks ddr4 3000 from Team Group and
yeah you can sort of check in right
there and sort of see how that's going
that's the sort of memory that we're
using you can see those LED strips and
stuff there interesting very very
interesting stuff and I guess as we've
got Miranda here in the chat I wonder
who that might be maybe it's someone I
know who's named Miranda is in the chat
thanks for using our super chat
functionality we have enabled that for
the chat so thank you for for supporting
us there
alright let's put in some memory was the
founder puttin the memory before you put
it into the case and let's put it
actually in slots 1 &amp;amp; 2 make sure you
get those in the right way
fun stuff alright well we've got the
base sort of stuff they're all ready to
go certainly a bit heavier now that
we've got all that stuff on the system
and yes certainly it's looking good
looking good and of course the Intel
top-down memory there in the center as
well are you guys interested in obtained
it's not something you we've been doing
a lot of testing with let us know in the
chat if you think that we should be
doing a bit more with opportunist sort
of comparing it to HD these STD SSDs and
all that sort of thing yeah I guess
that's why I was sort of curious about
the board because you know intel says
speeds up everything we'll see how that
goes in some actual testing at some
point in the future all right let's
clear out some of the packaging Tom says
I thought slots 0 are it slots 0 &amp;amp; 2 a
populated first this motherboard has
slots doesn't have a slot 0 it has slots
1 through 2 4 so guess that's
interesting ROM nip attempts says in the
chat thanks for using our super chat
feature it does actually support us so
for those of you who are supporting us
through patron or through super chat or
that definitely goes to helping us out
let's all use stickers Tim pick a
selection of the case that you can hide
but every sticker has a memento of
stream building it yeah maybe I should
put the sticker on the case I didn't
throw it around over there somewhere but
yeah it would be cool I guess is sort of
if you have a case to put the stickers
on as you sort of build up over time and
sort of show all the different things
that have been in there over time
because I guess cases are one of those
things that you don't really upgrade to
often so speaking in case I think it's
time to actually get the case
something we haven't shown on the stream
yet the dark bass 700 which conveniently
I took out of the box before doing it on
the stream because I thought you know
what trying to take a case out of a box
on a live stream is prone to all sorts
of fails and you know I prefer not to
have those sort of things going on
Internet but then again the first stream
didn't work that was the biggest fail so
for us her you know try and try and fix
one thing from happening try and prevent
one thing the second thing happens
anyway so I guess that's the way it sort
of works so this is the dark bass 700
interesting sort of case it's quite big
but I guess you know sometimes we need
space it's got if we look around here
you know all that tempered-glass
goodness we've also got the PSU shroud
and everything again I've just taken
this out I have not done anything with
it so far let's get this thing open I do
like the cases that have got the thumb
screws for taking off the tempered glass
because that definitely makes it much
easier to sort of move this stuff around
as long as of course it's properly
dampened and everything so you're not
getting vibrations when you're um you
know actually using the system that does
have some nice rubber stuff there I
wished I put this let's put it down here
that's for the future and of course we
have in here as well the box of all the
goodies yes Steve Steve has done the
research for us for those asking the
octane model is $15 more on Amazon so
that's actually not too bad I had
gigabyte hadn't sent over pricing for
the said 370 or assault regaling Wi-Fi
with octane but here it's only 15
dollars more that you know for some
people I know
you know if you're heavy on SSDs then it
might be better to just use SSDs but you
know considering it's only 15 bucks if
you're planning on getting say you know
a couple of hard drives you're planning
on maybe so just decided SSD spending up
to 15 bucks to give that octane that
actually sounds not too bad as far as
I'm concerned so yeah certainly a good
deal
so as you can see here this is the box
that has all the other cool stuff in it
and it seems like one of the little
baggies it's got the screws in it has
come a bit loose but I've got all the
usual sort of stuff with a be quiet case
you can see in here I don't actually
press the mouse with stuff I think
that's turn the sensitivity up on my
mouse crazily high let's fix that yeah
that's nice very nice um okay so I was
just happening in the chat at the moment
would I do a low end power supply rents
it depends depends I think there's
certainly a lot of really crappy power
supplies out there don't don't cheap out
in a power supply it's very important to
make sure you get an actual good quality
one so thumb screws the little standoffs
there already installed so I don't have
to do that which is nice but I will put
this in put in the i/o shield
Tom asked is there cost difference
between the board with octane and one
with that
yes fifteen dollars as it turns out
thanks Steve for looking that up look
yesterday and there wasn't actually
pricing on it so it's interesting that
now there is pricing slam in that IO
shield all right
so motherboard is in it's quite a nice
looking case I've got to say having seen
this just now for the first time yeah
it's not bad quite like the interior
nice and open very very open lots of
space for airflow and that sort of thing
in this particular case it's smooth no
let's put this back here actually there
you guys go unstable box stack all right
so let's move this over here all right
now I need to go get my trusty
screwdrivers because gonna screw in the
motherboard that case is huge yeah it is
it is but you know if you're getting a
typical sort of case it just fits your
standard ATX motherboard and that sort
of thing it's definitely no larger than
your sort of typical case for that you
know the space between here and then the
space just for the motherboard is just
big enough to fit that ATX board in so
you know it's not like you're getting
extra space around the sort of sides and
everything and there's definitely no
sort of cable management holes below the
motherboard like you get in some cases I
would say though it is quite wide
there's a 140 millimeter fan on the back
and there's I believe as well a 140
million the front and you've got
multiple slots for your 140s in the
front you've got slots for your
radiators at the top and I believe you
can get them in the front as well so you
know as far as that's concerned it
certainly is a bit of that wider sort of
case but 140 fans are quite good I quite
like him so um yeah as far as that's
going you like that screwdriver set yeah
if you're in Australian you can get
these through Bunnings Warehouse really
cheap and they're quite good quite good
screwdrivers so I don't mind those
all right
someone else is going on in the chat
over here should I remove the 4-pin
power for my crosshair six here and use
just the eight pyramid
yeah I think it depends on the sort of
overclocking you're doing but as far as
I'm aware I've been using my gigabyte
board that has both the eight and four
pin and just using the eight pin and
it's been perfectly fine even for
overclocking so I think you know they
have that option there for the extreme
overclockers you need that bit more CPU
power but for most people the standard
eight pin power could be perfectly fine
do you mean burning snags house of
course I mean burning snag house you
can't go there to Bane's warehouse
without buying some sausages especially
if you're there on a weekend there's no
better time to sort of go do your home
DIY get a whole bunch of stuff from
there and just go straight in get your
sausage and go sausages tastes pretty
good too and you support local charities
and all that for people overseas who are
wondering what the hell I'm talking
about Bunnings Warehouse is our major
sort of hardware store where you go you
can buy your timber you can buy your
tools you can buy your screws all that
sort of thing and every weekend they
have sort of like a barbecue out the
front it's really cool really cool
people go there support the local
charities and everything and yeah it's
certainly fun and I can't believe I'm
talking about bones warehouse on the
livestream on the internet so that
certainly is some fun stuff
to be going on there ok tighten those
bad boys up there boards in nice and
securely
ok so let's make sure we don't spill
screws are out out all over they're up
all over the place how do I accurately
calculate PC power drawn to choose a PSU
wattage there are some good people draw
calculators out there but typically what
you find is that with you know even if
you're using a 650 watt power supply
that even with some high-end components
in your system and overclocking that you
really won't get towards the upper limit
of that power supply so as long as
you're sort of choosing so that 500 watt
plus range and you're not going with
like crazy dual GPU setup so
making a mining rig or anything like
that most of those sort of power
suppliers would be perfectly fine for a
typical sort of gaming system just make
sure you get something that's actually a
quality brand make sure that it's at
least like 80 plus certified and
everything so that you know you like
this particular power supply 80 plus
gold this is the perfect sort of a power
supply for a build 650 watt it gives you
plenty of headroom if you're wondering
about you know how we calculate actual
power draw and stuff we use like
external wall monitors and stuff to see
what the total system power draw is
straight from the wall and you know it
doesn't really ever approach that 600
watt mark unless you're really pushing
your system and you've got some you know
crazy sort of stuff in there so I think
with power supplies you know it tends to
be not too difficult to sort of find the
right ones ROM Nippon it says sausage
sizzle stream yeah that would be pretty
pretty fun to do that's for sure tom
says so I'm guessing mining isn't all
that profitable in Australia yeah mining
in Australia not something our power
prices are like quite high by world
standards so the sort of profit you can
make from mining here isn't that good
unless you had like you're already
invested in like a solar array or
something and you sort of more off-grid
if you're getting your power straight
from the grid it really isn't worth it
to do it here it's um yeah quite
expensive so I guess that's a little bit
why straya hasn't been hit as hard with
the graphics card pricing sort of thing
while the u.s. was hit like Superbad and
that sort of regard at least over here
in Australia it's been going not too bad
at the moment in terms of graphics card
pricing availability tends to be a bit
difficult sometimes
all right make sure I don't explode my
voice before going to Computex by
Jessica livestream so let's get this our
silent loop in let's take a look at this
actually love that sound of packaging
that's always fun to sort of a look into
it's got the fans obviously they come
separately like most closely liquid
coolers he's the actual to medium to 280
millimeter radiator I should say it's
ports plastic glory so be looking at
that in just a second and yeah so they
do provide a whole bunch of stuff
including a little tube of thermal
grease in there that we would be putting
on some of them these companies apply
the apply the grease directly to the
cold plate there straight off the bat
but I like being able to apply it myself
all you guys will be able to criticize
me for my application of the thermal
paste in just a little bit so we'll have
a bit of fun with that
let's clear all this stuff out of the
way and get to putting this two eighty
millimeter radiator together so we do
have those RGB rings I'm going to leave
those there for the case fans just to
sort of simplify the whole situation and
I'll be installing this in the top of
the case
that's if you can install a radiator on
the top I think you can or would you
guys prefer me to see it install it in
the front because I can do either I
reck'n'd all looking fine there any
plans to overclock on stream potentially
in a different video
we might be doing that just for this
livestream though we thought you know
let's test that live stream let's do a
build video and see how that goes first
time ever streaming on a channel will be
very very interesting I'm gonna have fun
cleaning up in here before I have to
film use corner tomorrow that's for sure
so okay let me take a look at this case
and sort of see how we might go about
installing some stuff in here I'm
thinking the front mount might work a
little bit better in this particular
case which means we have to remove the
front cover
so how do you remove the front cover on
this sort of case it would be an
interesting sort of task because I
certainly haven't looked at this case
before let's get this rounded this way
so I can sort of have better look make
sure I don't put the case on any power
supplies or anything like that yeah so
we'll figure that out in just a moment
but first of all I will unscrew this fan
setup let's take a look here while I try
and Barriss myself to sort of find where
this sort of comes out here we go
simple stuff simple stuff here and there
we go oh it's kind of heavy sort of
design here it's got some rubber on the
inside I guess that's a bit of sound
dampening foam there but of course
you've got those connectors there that
connect up to the front for the
illumination that goes along with this
particular case so I'm just four seconds
and of course we have to remove this how
often do you guys clean your our fan
filters I always find every single time
I look at my fan filter it's absolutely
filthy so I'm probably not the most
diligent person ever when it comes to
removing those sort of things
I think I might need a slightly bigger
screwdriver for that those fan mounts
there don't step on it the thing yes
I've put on a box so I won't step on it
that would be pretty bad - doing the
live stream bill we're featuring some
big white stuff and you could put your
destroyit on the stream that would
certainly be fun so yeah fun stuff go
say what building my PC's sure all of
you guys do - as well
I think Computex as well we'll see some
really interesting stuff there sorry
guys
yeah I think we'll see some really
interesting stuff at Computex this year
I'm not sure about the GPUs Nvidia keeps
telling us at least to their event that
they're having their is meant to be a
small press event two hours apparently
qualifies as a small press event in
invidious mind so we'll see how that
goes in terms of nice this is actually
connected straight over to the back
we're going to need to take a look at
the back of this case to get that fan
mount out um yeah so in video they
they're having a two-hour sort of press
event on the Monday before Computex
starts and they say that it is a small
event whether or not small means we're
going to surprise you with GPUs or small
means we're going to talk for the entire
stream about you know our drive computer
stuff and now you know Quadro cards and
all that but yeah so I'm not hundred
percent sure whether we'll see Nvidia
cards at at Computex or not I think will
be interesting if they do show it but
the things that I think we're definitely
going to say we're definitely going to
see some be 450 boards we're definitely
see some thread Ripper stuff thread
rippers second-generation close to all
the signs are pointing that way at the
moment
and as well you know we might see a few
other interesting bits and pieces from
companies potentially the coffee leg you
know we're expecting to see eight core
coffee like soon
zedd 390 soon I think those two things
as well
boots man thank you for contributing to
us through the super chat stuff asks is
motherboard quality same on AMD / Intel
now I think definitely with the x4 70
range we're starting to see some really
high quality AMD motherboards with the
launch of said 370 I think AMD sort of
came out you know no one was really know
really knew how Rison would go in terms
of its performance whether it was worth
investing a lot of money to make those
really high quality motherboards so I
think some of the X 370 boards perhaps
could have had you know a bit better vrm
cooling bit better routing on the
motherboard more layers better memories
support but a lot of those things have
been fixed with x4 70 because the
motherboard manufacturers have seen just
how you know big Rison is at the moment
and how much support there is for that
sort of thing so I definitely think at
the moment if you're getting x4 70 if
you're getting X Z 370 that you're going
to get very similar quality between
those boards especially from some of the
high-end stuff definitely no more
skimping on quality on the AMD side as
you know manufacturers sort of learn
what is going to sell and what isn't
going to sell I think a lot of those
companies were perhaps a bit surprised
at the success of Rison which is sort of
meant that they're going a bit harder
all out on the sort of second gen stuff
and yes Steve is in the chat
remove these twist ties good for cable
management but not good for freaking out
where this fan routes further down still
right into the fan controller so another
be quiet fan probably could put this on
the well I've got two different fans got
pure wings here for the close of liquid
cools at the silenced wings three for
the case fans but we'll keep that for
later
find attention there might be somewhere
else to put it but now they've got that
front one out we can sort of see how
this is going to go in so yeah that
should go in nicely all right let's get
the fans on now because we're using in
the front of course they're going to be
intake fans and the envy build where I
put in the top I also made them
I also made them intake and a lot of
people were questioning why I would put
them intake when I also had front intake
fans and the reason for that is is that
you know you want positive pressure in
cases pushes the dust out keeps the dust
out it doesn't really make too much of a
difference in general from the sort of
stuff we've seen where the over your top
mounts either intake or exhaust but you
know you want to make sure that your
overall fan configuration is going to be
pushing air out of the case most of the
time so yeah we'll see how that goes
ok so we're going to have to put these
obviously the cooler is going to go in
this way like this so we're going to
have to have the fans on this side and
because they can take where you're going
to put them up this way and make sure I
don't screw it up when doing it because
have been some times of course you
install the core you realize to put the
fans around the wrong way
that tends to be super annoying alright
let's find the right screws and stuff
we're going to have to use look at that
AMD mounting kit which we're not going
to need for this particular build yeah
some people getting impatient with
nvidia already yeah it's been a very
long generation a very very long
generation of cards it'll be really good
to get some new stuff from them but it's
really hard to say when they're sort of
going to be making everything because
we've got we've had this stuff for a
while the Pascal stuff for a while
they've teased us with the Titan V be
really nice to get an 1180 TI or
something or 1180 who knows but it
certainly would be nice to get some more
stuff in via where'd I put my
screwdrivers out here there huh so yeah
let us know what you understand so go
around and take a look at it Computex
will be there for quite a while so we're
certainly be making a lot of content
there if you see anything cool give us a
shout out we'll go check it out make
sure you're following us and other
relevant feeds and everything just to
make sure that you can get all the
latest and greatest stuff from us and
yeah probably should get some more water
make sure I don't spill this water
inside the case as well that would be
bad which I get some lovely drinking
sounds for me there alright what's been
else has been going on in the stream
zero dropped frames that's very nice
very very nice to have zero dropped
frames so far why no second camera well
I can show you the second camera but at
the moment it looks a bit dodgy I'm
gonna sort of see here whoa second
camera so you can sort of see inside the
case at the moment let me get
there we go so you can sort of see what
we've done here already with the board
and this is where the liquid cool is
going to go but for the moment we're
just going to stall the fans on the
liquid cooler and go from there
Graham says get a new chair in the super
chat feature yeah a lot of people
complain about this about this old man
chair let me know what you think about
the old man status of this particular
chair and whether or not I should get
certainly a gaming chair this is just
our dining chairs so yeah it can't be
too bad but I guess for a comfort if
you're doing a lengthy game it says
you're not gonna want to sit in
something like that where can I get the
water bottle that is a Qualcomm water
bottle and yeah it says Qualcomm on it
they gave it to me at something I'm not
sure way else you can get it be cool if
you get it's a really good water bottle
actually so there'll be lots and lots of
screwing in this video now that sounds
bad doesn't it lots of screwing I meant
screwing in screws for fans not other
sorts of screwing I want to say that
other sort of spell my god I just drop a
screw through here
so this is normal of the stuff that we
would do off-camera sort of this
building stuff normally we would sort of
be filming it as we go and sort of
making all that nice b-roll but yeah why
don't you change it up a little bit and
do a live stream see how that goes I'll
see you guys saying this is a good time
to sort of read the chat and sort of see
how it's going you can't screw on
YouTube yeah that's definitely true you
know we put that sort of screwing on
YouTube I think there'll be some our
questions coming our way
probably violate the Community
Guidelines that's for sure yeah d
monetize that'll be right D monetized
did you guys pay for FTTP NBN cause the
internet isn't usually this streaming
I'm lucky enough to have fibers of the
premises here so I've got the good NBN
which definitely helps for stuff like
live streaming if and all that but
obviously a lot of other people get way
worse deals when it comes to the NBN so
I'm just lucky that I'm gonna fire into
the premises area steve is on fixed
wireless which is just awful fixed
wireless internet no good at all
yeah fibre to the node I've heard some
my parents with fibre to the node and
it's been perfectly fine for them but I
think they're quite close to the node so
that probably helps them out a fair bit
YouTube is the only place screwing does
not make money well you say that I'm
doing some screwing on the channel right
now and hopefully we'll be making some
Adsense money but who knows fibre to the
node you have 1.3 kilometres from the
node 22 megabits yeah that's unfortunate
not to much better than 80 her cell
there yeah the Internet situation in
Australia is really not that good if
you're really lucky to get a place with
fiber then great otherwise you're stuck
with like cable internet which has
terrible upload speeds that we couldn't
do this sort of thing with fiber the
nerd what else a DSL yeah it's just all
a mix-up
yeah I know someone says here in the
chat cable internet 500 megabit down 25
megabit up yeah in some countries you
can get that but just for for here for
some reason they don't they haven't
upgraded the HFC infrastructure for a
while so it's like really outdated and
yeah it hasn't been maintained very well
and the whole whole network is just
crumbling into pieces so that's sort of
why you see yeah that's sort of thing
not doing too well over here which is
unfortunate because the actual way cable
internet works is quite good and can be
upgraded and everything like that is
just that you know as far as the
companies that we have the to provide
cable internet and not really doing as
good of a job as you would potentially
hope for so of course we need the dongle
that attaches the two fans into one we
will do that in just a moment but first
let's screw in the screw in the radiator
how about that copper should be dead
yeah yeah it really should be at this
point it's certainly certainly if you're
building sort of a new network after you
internet it would be certainly advisable
not to make it with copper in any part
of the network at this point but you
know companies try cheap out so let me
see if this works they fit in this way
think it will just fit with the cables
at the top so you can sort of see here
let's get on to this second camera that
we have over here you can see here at
the moment I've got the liquid cooling
loop at the top which is my preference
II and I think it's just going to be a
little tight getting the screws into the
top section here but other other than
there
yeah I think I might have to it's an
interesting fit with this particular
cooler in this particular case but I
think it should be just okay just on the
the maximum sort of cooler size you
could get in the frontier certainly in
this two eighty millimeter that we've
got here so that will be working quite
well we were getting so close to a world
class Network yeah that's definitely
true definitely true we were going to
get good internet here and then
unfortunately some things happen you
governments come in they change it all
up and that's just the way it goes
unfortunately sometimes
hmm he's a strange yeah I'm gonna have
to pull that back just slightly I reckon
to get that in get that fitting in a bit
better here's the CPU D let it know the
CPU is not deal with it just as a
general thing that we sort of do with
our review units and testings we try and
keep it as the sort of we know a lot of
people do delayed their CPUs but
certainly for the sort of things that we
want to be testing most people don't so
we sort of figure you know we want to
keep the the way we use our hardware to
be as close to the way that you guys
using your hardware and considering most
you guys don't do any we want to sort of
keep that sort of the same so that we
can give you guys the same impressions
that we always do on the rest of the
stuff so after I install this liquid
core
let's give Steve a call Steve you're
watching the stream because you should
prepare yourself once I've got this
thing installed to get into some Skype
action this did work before the Skype
stuff so hopefully it'll work again I've
still got a few more screws for the
radiator to go we've got to put on the
thermal paste and attach the radiator
first so yeah certainly interesting
stuff
great master gaming says I'm at school
yeah this is a really good use this is
this is going to be more educational
than whatever you're doing at school
trust me I've been to school I've been
to uni and I would learn way more from
YouTube live streams of being at school
if YouTube live streams are more of a
thing back then
there were a thing when I was at uni but
not as much in high school and stuff
yeah you should probably work I don't
know about that surely watching surely
watching a hardware unbox livestreams
better than doing schoolwork the work
sucks this is coming for someone spent
five years at uni
no no no that still has Fox still thinks
it's good I might get rid of it it's
good for sport
I have Fox still to watch AFL but apart
from that yeah cord cutting is
definitely the way to go just watching
stuff through you know you're you
Netflix's and all that sort of thing is
a lot better than using Fox Dolls to
sort of watch your TV shows and stuff
steve says sustains to school kids yes
definitely stay in school just if you're
doing a heart we're doing a hide around
box livestream it might be the best idea
you know I'm not going to put that last
screw in because that's I've got seven
of the eight screws in anyway that one's
going to be a little difficult to get in
now school school doesn't suck it's
definitely important to to go to school
and actually learn things but it
certainly sometimes isn't the most
enjoyable thing I definitely understand
and I think with uni as well like I
really enjoyed going to uni and I really
enjoyed you know you make friends at uni
you learn a lot of stuff I did an
engineering degree so obviously there's
a lot of math involved and and all that
stuff was certainly very interesting so
yeah there's definitely plenty of reason
to stay in school do degrees and all
that sort of thing I ended up making
YouTube videos now after doing a degree
so you never know how your life's going
to turn out but something there are lots
of useful things that you can learn at
Union you know if I wasn't doing this I
would have gone into doing engineering
and probably would have had an okay job
doing that so it's definitely recent to
to enjoy stuffing and really if you are
in school and you're sort of thinking
about what you want to do definitely
look at all the STEM careers and all
that sort of thing it's really important
having STEM jobs and everything is
really important and to sort of continue
to grow all that science and maths and
technology and everything cuz without
that we wouldn't have people that
engineer the products that we're using
for these sort of build videos so yeah
one thing I would say though is
definitely enjoy your time at school
definitely enjoy your time in school
now I probably in hindsight should have
put this bracket on before I put the uh
before I put the rest of it in but you
know that's just the way it goes in fact
I think I'm going to need to take the
motherboard house because I need to put
on this retention arm on the back yeah
because I didn't open the cooler box
before I did this this definitely needs
to go on the back of the motherboard so
whoops screwed that one up a little bit
Arty's need to ask what fully team I
support the Adelaide Crows who are not
doing too well at the moment not doing
too got absolutely smashed on the
weekend let's have some fun
taking the motherboard out and putting
the cooler arm on I knew I'd stuff up
something during the stream and it would
be putting in the motherboard too early
so you get another good look at this
board in just a moment as we pull it out
alright so yes we definitely need to put
that on because this bracket goes on the
front and this little bracket goes on
the back so let's just align all the
holes get the little standoffs in
through all the holes make sure that
fits in nice alright let's get off there
little it's a tape surprise units here
in Australia don't offer you tubing
courses that would be interesting there
certainly is a lot more that goes into
making the You Tube channel I think a
lot of people realize so and it's a lot
of fun to make youtube videos as well
even if you're not you know doing it on
a professional level and you're doing is
your job even if you just do it as a
hobby it can certainly be a lot of fun
so make sure we get all of those in the
right holes
hmm I see little rubber bits have been
and we're probably going through so
all right that's better I'm gonna move
now when I drop those in just a bit
loose there on the end in the end
okay
right there we go there all through now
all through and just to make sure I'm
going to install the block on this
prefer coming back in otherwise we might
might get a few more shoes but hopefully
not so please remove before use yeah
very important stuff to do that let's
get this slotted on first so I believe
these need to go in here like this
so you know just quick throws on
they're nice and clicked on and that
should be ready to go
so hopefully we can get that in there
all nice okay move stock thermal paste
bro please doesn't actually come with
thermal paste on the CPU cool they have
provided this thermal grease which I'm
just going to use that because it's been
included why not we'll see how it goes I
can always replace it later
okay retention bracket mechanism gotta
say not the not the most intuitive and
easy way to install this thing be nice
if there was a way to UM clamp those
into a specific point on this thing to
sort of stop them from sliding around as
much all right let's call Steve let's
give him a call and see what's going on
and make sure that everything is going
okay got this other webcam here that
we've got going on so I can just scoot
over here and let's see if we can call
him and see what's going on
hello Steve are you there I'm not sure
we getting any audio from you
testing testing is the audio working at
the moment
got no idea well we tested this is
another thing that we tested yesterday
that was uh not working at the moment
let me see what I can do here
um
alright let me just switch back to over
here so I can do some stuff over here
and see what people see what's going on
here
interesting stuff on the stream here
testing stuff that works on one day
doesn't work on the other day it's
always nice when stuff like that happens
can we hear you now Steve I don't know
you tell me
is that working I think that's working
Lee hopefully can you guys hear me
hopefully we're good
don't what changed there okay well yeah
nothing works the first time on YouTube
apparently yeah that's right
can't believe that we tested everything
yesterday and everything was working
fine and then you come around this day
and then like literally nothing works
second time away today is not the day to
stream anyway we are back so how are we
going with this our CPU block in the
stall
they have standoff chips got it you've
got to screw into the back plate first
don't they yeah this one's got like a
like a plastic thing with the little
standoffs that go through and you're
supposed to stick it on the back but the
adhesive isn't very strong so it's like
don't bother doing that just sit it
there on the desk like you had it and
put the top screws in and then you and
then you can sit the board in oh that's
a good way to do it yeah
pro tip pro tip from the pro I gotta
gotta get you building more computers to
many laptops for Tim yeah that's right
just gonna figure out where actually put
the screws for this thing
so here if you have any questions for
Steve feel free to put them into the
chat and yeah we'll do some do some Q&amp;amp;A
stuff yep I'm really excited for the
thermal paste application we'll have to
jump to the second camera for that and
get a look at that that's gonna be good
Oh people are gonna be so mad at
whatever I do it's gonna be crazy to be
watching the whole street hasn't been
going so far Steve yeah really good you
can stick me up in the top corner if you
want people don't want to look at me oh
come on they want to see the build I can
just answer questions I'll just be a
voice you've got you've got me in there
twice anyway I think you've got two
videos of me one is plenty is it Steve
if you were to take all the hardware you
have how much would it cost I don't know
to be a lot it'd definitely be a lot I
don't really know how much probably
don't want to work it out and advertise
that fact that yeah I've got a lot Steve
say banana banana got your money's worth
on that one it's all our funny accents
mate you know it's just just the way the
Aussie world works actually talk about
Bunnings Warehouse on the stream and NBN
we can hidden all the Aussie buzzwords
on this particular show well the
Bunnings chat was one of the highlights
for me I'll have my Bunning snags did
your buddy whoever Bunnings nearby Steve
well relatively nearby it's about 20
minutes away so that qualifies that's
close for me that's very local
but yeah the reason I'm not there today
helping to do this build is because I'll
be driving to Tim's house in two days
time to go to Computex and it is a five
hour round trip to get to Tim's place
from my place and then back again
so I didn't really want to do that when
we I've got two videos I have to finish
before the weekend before we go to
Computex so I'm working on those but
obviously I've stopped to join you guys
on the livestream so yeah bit
time-sensitive at the moment I didn't
really want to spend five hours in the
car today so I thought we just dial in
this way but if we do this again
in a month or so I'd definitely like to
join Tim because it looks like he's
having a lot of fun there and I'm
missing out just sitting at home
watching I certainly has a lot of fun
doing some piece of building on the
livestream
didn't really know how this is going to
go at all and it seems to be going okay
I would say yeah I think you're doing a
great job it's going good I mean I've
been enjoying watching and our chatting
with the guys in the chat yeah we we do
have to get Tim an unboxing knife so
we're working on that
yep five hours yeah well it without
traffic what would you say to him it's
about an hour and a half to two hours to
get from my place to your place of life
yeah yeah it depends on how much of the
road works you get hit by on the way
yeah I think if there's no roadworks
it'll be an hour and a half but at the
last was like our 45 hour 50 yeah and we
have really slow speed limits in
Australia so that doesn't help yeah and
if you catch peak hour traffic then it
could be a lot more than five hours so
yeah but we like to catch up once a
month do the q and A's and we do the
patron livestream and maybe we'll start
doing you know a sort of a build stream
two weeks away from the Q &amp;amp; A or
something like that so I'll be driving a
Tim's place twice a month instead of
once and I am right now coming to you
guys through the 4G on my phone because
my NBN Wi-Fi dropped out twice while I
was watching this stream so I just
changed over to my phone so hopefully I
don't drop out that's just the luck of
the hydrobox live stream it's literally
everything the day before you've been
doing live streams for our patreon for
how many months is it now since the
start plus and you're going to do a live
game on the main channel and everything
stops working
yeah everything well we worked out not
to do that even the patron live streams
from my place because that's been
challenging yeah anyway not that good
what computer you bring at Computex I'm
we're both taking laptops we're both
taking six core Intel laptops or six
core 12th row bets because we're doing
video editing and
coding so we need the most powerful
laptops we can get our hands on tim is
using an ASA one which he has in the
live stream here and I'll be taking a
new MSI model as at the GS 63 that's it
isn't it Tim you're the expert
the Jo 65 I think - the new one that's
one I reviewed on the channel right a
couple
yeah it must be I'll be taking the one
that Tim reviewed recently so I think
that would be good it's a good laptop
it's really good so I think you'll
definitely enjoy that yeah yeah well
your review certainly made it sound
quite good so I'll be interested to see
if it it stands up to Tim's review there
yes I am on wireless ambient wireless
and speeds are pretty good for the most
part it's a what is it a fifty twenty
plan so it's not amazing but I year two
years ago I was uploading all our 4k
YouTube videos on ADSL plus and it took
about a day to upload the videos so now
it takes an hour so I'm pretty happy
with that
yeah better than a day how's the build
going where you up to my face is
covering the PC case at the moment on
the stream oh yeah hang on let me uh let
me fix that actually will put you over
here well block the laptop how about
that that'll do you guys gonna test
store mi yeah Tim and I have talked
about that we have yeah I think we're
going to it'll possibly we'll do
something with this new octane build as
well so I don't know but yeah that's
something to look at what we get back
from Computex plenty of things to do at
the moment I've just put together a Vega
56 vs. GTX 1072 I revisit with some of
the newer games released this year the
latest drivers of course and there's
about 25 games they've done so there'll
be a video for Sunday I believe but yeah
that was an interesting update I suppose
on the bat battle so not I no super
exciting because of the way graphics
card prices are and they're 2 years old
now at least the Pascal series is but
it's an update so yeah that should be an
interesting one a look out for and
I have some memory tests with coffee
break for Saturday so yeah plenty of
videos in the pipeline of course
tomorrow we have a news corner so Tim
will be getting onto that straight after
the flop stream no doubt I have to look
at the topics from this week I haven't
really been keeping up too much on the
news of the week yeah exactly
Steve would you guys ever discuss the
deeper architecture of components kind
of like gamers Nexus yeah we've done we
do those videos from time to time it's
not something we focus on a lot I
suppose there's only so much content you
can do they've sort of focused on that
we focused on so if I know they do a lot
of in-depth benchmarking as well we just
do a different kind of in-depth
benchmarking and then Tim's gonna start
doing his in-depth monitor testing which
he's already been doing a bit of but
yeah we do those kind of things from a
timer time and sometimes we focus on
other things as well around you know
newly released technology just like I do
with the horizon AP use but yeah I think
we sort of like to try and sort of fit
somewhere between the normal YouTube
tech channels and gamers Nexus so yeah I
think we've been doing that quite well
what do you reckon Tim yeah I'd agree
with you I'm just about to put the
thermal paste on so know that there's
gonna be so much we want the alternate
camera all right can you put that other
what the other camera in like picture
and picture it's like the left above me
or something the other came I can do
like this hang on is that we've got to
see the thermal paste application oh
there's no way you can do it right no
matter which way you do it we just want
to see which wrong way you do it so here
we go let's get this better in there
it's right here we go is there is there
target down here um okay so guys which
way should we do the thermal paste you
prefer the line or do you prefer the dot
the X there's so many different ways to
do it you can't just do the dot either
it's the size of the dot that's right
that's right so let's take a look at the
chatons tool people are thinking about
the way to person
comments come in about their the way
that we're going to do it we want to
know exactly what you guys think and
then I'm going to completely ignore all
of it and just do what I recommend
yeah well I don't think you can go to
wrong to be honest with you yeah I think
I think the mod Matt says you can do the
dot or the cross for coffee like I can't
recall exactly I quite like the dot I
reckon I like the dot dot simple easy
and it usually spreads pretty well
especially in the coffee like it's not a
thread ripper chip okay here we go
fingers crossed that balls this one this
is the key moment of the livestream
happening right here is the thermal
paste application it's going very very
very carefully let's get some wood block
it for you guys
oh yes success I reckon that's nailed it
right there I can't actually see it
right now because we're 20 seconds ahead
of the actual stream but yeah there we
go
Eric and that's good yeah that looks
like a pretty good amount to me yeah be
right funny wasn't trying to there we go
there you guys can see it a bit better
down there in there that's the
controversial thermal paste application
gone completely wrong cuz of course
everyone is gonna be complaining about
how much the only post I put on about
how I didn't put on a knife now it looks
like you've done a good job there I'd
give that a pass I've got to make sure
that I removed the warning label
otherwise don't have to do it all again
there we go well the the 8700 K I'll
just melt that off it'll melt a hole
through it and yeah just have uh it'll
take up any air gaps so now I believe
this this requires you to just put these
through here with the spring on it I
think yep that sounds right
I'll make sure I get everything out and
ready to go
sauce is happening Steve what do you in
up to today more video editing like
yesterday on the test race yeah well
I've been editing that 25 game GPU
comparison though just spoke about so
I've almost done that so that's good and
straight after this I have to go film
Saturday's video so yeah yeah I've done
all the testing for that there's a lot
of interesting results in that ones I
think you guys are really going to enjoy
that
it's a mainly Intel focused video with
the core i5 8400 but yeah it's really
good so some GPU scaling results in that
one so that should should make quite a
few viewers happy I think and then I
think well hopefully on Friday I've got
to start doing a sort of checklist of
all the things we have to take to
Computex cuz it's not getting through
notes as we gets that way yeah yeah
we're definitely to make sure that way
of maximizing our luggage space as well
yes yes definitely you could take like a
million kilos count yeah you play
business class flyer I think 40 is the
limit for what I've got but yeah what do
you think is the max core can't
recommend it for using the ring bus why
did Intel decide to use the mesh instead
I don't know what the max is we've seen
the 69 50 X is a 10 core part that uses
the ring bus but it was a very big chip
it didn't overclock particularly well it
was very power hungry when you started
pushing it so the ring bus is really
great for like your 8700 K but obviously
it works well for six cores though it
does start to get quite power hungry not
blaming a load on the ring bus though
but definitely when going I would say
beyond 10 cause the mesh certainly
beyond 20 anyway I don't know what the
exact number is because we don't have
a ring bus cpu with more than ten cores
so it's really hard to compare a ring
bus and a mesh and then there are other
changes to the cache and stuff like that
so I can't really say for sure but
obviously the ring bus is exceptionally
good very low latency and that's why it
works really well with games would the
Wraith prison be able to keep the risin
7:17 and 1700 overclocked a three point
yeah yeah the Wraith prison would at 75
at less than 75 degrees depends on your
ambient temperatures in your case and
whatever but that seems doable for the
Wraith prism on the Verizon 7 1700 I'm
just putting on the little screws to put
the closed-loop liquid cooler on just
got to prepare it all before it goes on
I think my audio is a bit louder than
yours turns might gain down a bit now
hopefully that's still ok I reckon I'll
be fine can't be as bad as when we tried
to start the stream and it didn't work
yeah no what was that with that how
frustrating as Jim said we spent quite a
bit of time yesterday with our patron
members running a test stream and Tim
called me we dialed in and we got the
audio levels right and there was no real
problems at all was there yesterday no
not really
no and then you go to start that's just
a choppy mess I don't know what's up
with that anyway yeah leave it overnight
and it completely fails on you how worst
part is we didn't even change anything
to fix it we just started the script of
the stream again so I think something
must have gone wrong with that stream
yeah I restarted my computer but apart
from that yeah dono just the way it is I
guess why would you buy the wraith
prison for your 1700 surely you should
get a an aftermarket cooler pretty much
yeah the AMD box coolers aren't worth
buying because they are very pricey for
what they are and there's so many good
aftermarket coolers for even 30 40 US
dollars 50 60 Australian dollars
did you think about shipping things
stuff to your hotel overnight do you
mean from Australia I got to be pretty
expensive wouldn't overnight shipping
from Australia to Taiwan oh yeah yeah
that cost a fortune
yeah probably not cost-effective I think
we can fit everything in our luggage so
I managed a large gear by myself so with
both of us going that should be a lot
easier this year we should be able to
make much better content this year as
well
Tim's audio is buzzing a little bit is
this it's got a slight buzz to open it's
you know compared to how the stream
started I don't think it will stress
about it too much well we'll just
optimize these build streams as we go
but yeah so Steve could you do an
all-white build yeah I could
I might soon I've got a few new cases
and things and builds coming in for
later in the month so that could be an
option how's it going there Tim what are
you up to now
oh yeah just about to put the whole
thing together actually so the spring
the spring series went on without a
problem
yep excellent now I just have to figure
out how to apply enough pressure to it
to keep it all in while I ask grew it
all down Gabriel says is it right that
AMD will offer double the cause in
future CPUs don't know if it'll be
doubled for all the models but it's
possible again we don't really know with
these rumors and things but when they go
to seven nanometer which is comparable
to Intel's 10 nanometer in size it's
certainly possible that they'll
definitely be more cause whether it be
double I don't know but yeah that'd be
pretty awesome if it was especially for
Isis stay the same what's a good 240
millimeter all in one liquid cooler you
know straight up for Australian buyers
hmm you have a quick look and see what I
can find here
that uh that model you've got Tim looks
pretty interesting which one the model
you've got the quiet silent with 280
yeah it is interesting
certainly isn't has got an interesting
mounting mechanism
oh I see why yes II you said to the
backplate has come off again because the
adhesive isn't very good and it doesn't
like stick through so I don't even
bother using that I just I pre I put a
lamenting gear on first before I install
it yeah I mean it is possible to put the
backplate on but the thing is like you
need to have the cooler you need to have
all the mounting stuff attached to the
cooler on this side and the other trick
is you can remove the SD yeah sorry the
SSD tray on the opposite side of the
motherboard tray and then access the
rear of the motherboard I've got every
SSD on this board the case yeah if it
didn't we'd be throwing it out right now
it definitely does yeah all right let me
take a look it's a good a good quality
yeah yes we'll go that's we go that way
yeah I'll put that link in the chat that
seems like I've used one of those before
a nice enemy fairly good quality that
seems like a good price for 90s
Australian dollars otherwise they do
start to get up there a bit well over
$100 but that's what I've looked into
checking out just after a bit of a brief
look there
let's see what other questions that we
got here
overclocking ddr3 mmm I don't know I
don't know if you'll get ddr3 2400 past
2600 I haven't done ddr3 overclocking
for a long time
it'll also come down to the memory
controller as well so yeah I'm not
haven't really got me good advice on
that one
gonna be a humming on your mic there
again yeah yeah and you bowl you went
right up so much that's all of it
turn back down now strange no that was
just from me bending over and struggling
with this cooler yeah it's sort of dick
gonna be distorted as well but anyway
hopefully it'll it'll come back to us
having 10 plus ring bus cause would best
anything on the market good combination
of cause and latency I mean not really
because you would probably have like a
two gigahertz base frequency so to keep
it within a reasonable TDP and you'd
need an insanely be your motherboard if
you wanted to run that at any kind of
frequency above like four point five
gigahertz so it's not really just a
matter of just tacking on more cause 40
nanometers and having a beefy chip
whittler a 10 plus 4 ring bus chip would
add a reasonable frequency would ya
consume a heck of a lot of power maybe a
beast but you want a power plant for it
I honestly thought you guys Tim and
Steve worked in the same office no team
works from his house and I work from my
house so but we have set up to him with
a fairly decent studio or set now he's
in his garage so not many of you guys
remember the garage door for videos not
that long ago sometimes of the garage
door yep what else we got here is the
subscription-based
Adobe software worth it to learn yeah
sure I mean you can I believe you can
just pay monthly if you wanted to so you
can give it a go for a month I mean it
is it is pricy software I think I pay
about $30 a month $28 or something like
that I haven't used many of the other
editing software but Adobe Premiere Pro
is very good and I really enjoy it yeah
when it's when it's working and doing
what you want it to it does can be a bit
funny at times yeah I just use um Sony
Vegas for a while back when I was
learning to video in it and Premiere is
by far and away better mmm at least at
the time which would have been a couple
years ago but certainly premiere is a
lot more features that make our lives a
lot easier
yeah all right got the cooler aligned
and in notice have to screw it in
excellent
very good xsplit works when you're done
will be embarrassing if you I get this
thing built it doesn't turn on off
you're telling me I mean with all the
other things that have gone wrong so far
you're struggling to put this cooler on
you know it'll be the icing on the cake
right there yeah but you know it's all
about it's all about having a bit of fun
on a live stream seeing what happens
Isis just curious as to how much of a
dud by risin 320 200 years CPM actors
out 3.8 gigahertz
IPG at 1500 megahertz and it doesn't
overclock a ram worth anything ddr4 2666
with samsung edye that could be more
than memory there or the motherboard
possibly but that's not really a dud
basically I think my 2200 G did about
3.9 gigahertz with I could only
overclock the CPU or the IGP you I
couldn't overclock them both with the
Box cooler so if you're using the Box
cooler then that's actually a really
good result that's as good as any chip
will do but yeah 3.8 gigahertz on all
caused isn't too bad it's pretty good
and 15 1.5 gigahertz on the GPU you're
gonna see pretty good gaming performance
for what it is all right I'm scrolling
through their comments I'm getting there
now I'm gonna install one of these
fantex halos on this rear 140 I reckon
I'll just use one of them for this
particular build
okay and we'll see how that goes yeah
use those before so just erasing if you
want to add RGB dia build I guess you
know there's no better way than to sort
of get one of these things if you don't
want to buy RGB fans mm-hm well yeah
it's it depends on how much they cost
individually but it could be a cheaper
way to upgrade the fans you already have
if you want to be too bling
they were pretty cheap from memory when
I looked yesterday someone check
bandwidth usage the video looks grainy
it looks really clear especially for a
livestream on my end
where
Australia guys come on no all of us have
good internet yeah okay you Biff explore
exploder is saying that you're you might
have like automatic gain on your
microphone I don't I don't know if you
do or if you've got Windows adjusting
and all software adjusting it I'm pretty
I'm pretty sure I turned it off so not
sure why maybe something's just gone a
bit crap recently are you planning the
stream frequently from now on yeah if
this goes well this could be something
we do like I said monthly we do our Q&amp;amp;A
monthly we could also do a live PC build
stream or something I don't know or even
a live show once a month and go from
there we'll work it out but it really
depends on whether you guys enjoy it or
not are you sponsored by any PC tech
brand not really I mean this content
that we're doing right now has well it's
technically been sponsored by PC case
gear not financially but they're
providing us with the gear so thumbs up
to them thanks for that and gigabyte of
course with their gigabyte they've sent
along some hardware so yeah we're gonna
give these and our team group and fan
text which were all provided through PC
case key but yeah we're going to give
those guys shirts because this stuff
costs a lot of money and we can't afford
to do a monthly stream if we're buying
the hardware that's just not not gonna
happen so this is the halo thing that
we're going to install and you just put
that in between your fan and via so
we've got a fan of see well I can't take
it out because it's actually attached in
but I'm going to slug that between the
case and the fan and then I think the
the RGB will sort of glow through around
the edge of the fan I guess that's the
idea of putting one of these in yep
that should be good
how do you like Adobe Premiere with the
new Intel a GPU acceleration in addition
to regular GPU
too much testing on that we were going
to look into all that sort of stuff for
a second gen thread Ripper coverage Tim
did test it out though and it probably
is
am I right saying it's not useful for
what we do Tim because we do a two pass
oh we are are you talking about the
quick premiere stuff with the
interesting yeah yeah yeah it currently
it only works with one passing codes and
we use to pass for the superior quality
at the moment so it is something to look
into because I think on one pass it does
make Intel CPU is very very competitive
it's just it only works with some sort
of settings at the moment in terms of
premiere but I think the guys over it
game is Nexus right they did some
testing on it yes yep
and I think my camera has just died I
knew I was gonna have to replace the
battery at some point yeah I should have
given you that DC power pack last time
we caught up but anyway will I'll give
you that next time and you can solve
that for the next stream but these are
just our little our little fun teething
problems on the stream I'll let him
address that yep one second how much
speed would you leave the best expelled
game experience six 950 exit four
gigahertz is better than 700 or 0.8
gigahertz yeah I mean games don't really
use that many cores so even the six 950
X is going to be heavily underutilized
in most games so going beyond 10 cores
isn't really going to help and that's
the problem look well rise and secondly
I always kind of based though that's
April 16th right we're starting this
evening
those are at core CPUs but I think going
beyond 10 course we're probably getting
a bit of a bit ahead of ourself at the
moment for gaming Hagar Mayor Jim Scott
from PC Kowski was just asking us when
there when the stream will be finished
so so I should probably respond to him
you'll have to turn the auto gain off
your Windows setting for your mic if you
can yeah I don't know what's going on
there it's all right at the moment hmm
regarding premiere discrete GPU
acceleration is premiere at best with
AMD cards using open cell or Nvidia
cards with CUDA I think Nvidia cards I'm
not sure if it's changed with recent
updates or not it's not something we've
done a lot of testing with we generally
just use the GTX 10 atti because that's
what we use in our test system I don't
know if gamers Nexus or anyone else has
done that kind of testing but we
certainly haven't so I can't give you
any concrete information there can you
tell the difference between one versus
the true pass after YouTube compression
you definitely can I mean the higher the
higher the quality video that you give
to YouTube the better result you'll get
once they compress it it doesn't
compress everything just sort of like an
even playing field if you will yeah it
can help certainly I've noticed one
passed it's a little more feel look
closely especially at the 4k stuff it's
a little more blocky yeah where is the
do pass stuff is definitely more clearer
I know for a lot of the content where
you do it probably doesn't matter too
much but if you can make it a bit better
why not yeah pretty much
and what else we got here
what are you up to now open the roof and
where I prune they're the Halos on the
rear fan okay new Verizon 2600 XO
pre-owned 59 30 K well I guess it really
comes down to what the price is you're
getting them for but if they're a
similar price they'd probably get the
rise and CPU just because it's new
hardware that comes with a warranty and
obviously has an upgrade path so you can
go to Verizon three down the track what
was then - whatever you want to call it
so yeah better upgrade path there and
you can just take advantage of newer
technologies as well Tim you're buzzing
wall a does buzz a bit from time to time
but well let him off the hook
Oh some people are saying they can hear
me through your speakers I think that
was when I was close to the laptop
before because I have to be able to hear
Steve somehow and I don't have any spy
earpieces in or anything yeah
spy earpieces will be the upgrade for
next stream is there a bit rate you can
achieve where YouTube won't
Riaan courage your uploaded video no
they've ranked on everything so it
doesn't there's no like magic
pass-through option unfortunately lately
change it yeah they always change it are
we going to be reviewing the razor blade
15 Tim yes they are sending one out
after Computex awesome good stuff they
were gonna send one out before but I
wouldn't have had time to look at it so
sort of let them off the hook on that
one see if you do a chest with
background apps like antiva antivirus
steam you play origin or similar VLC
browsers like kind of stuff I'm yeah I
think I will have a got that after
Computex I'll try and find a way to make
that as accurate as reliable as possible
and I'll give that a go just because is
so heavily requested and I try to do the
content that you guys want to see so
yeah I'll definitely have a go at doing
that and hopefully we can get a fairly
accurate by having sort of a long video
playing and try to simulate stuff that
sort of happens over a long period of
time so it's not constantly changing
throughout the benchmark but yeah yes is
the answer I will do that I have to ask
you Steve well while you're around so
we're using this gigabyte board that has
the integrated obtain memory in it and
you've figured out that it only costs
fifteen dollars more I believe so yeah
what are you working about that what do
you recommend it's all obtained into
grow up Dane thing mmm I knew someone
was going to ask about it I I don't know
I really don't know I have yeah I
haven't used it I mainly because I
haven't seen the point to it so I don't
know if
I'm accurate there if I'm wrong about
that I don't know but that's something
we have to probably look into but
assuming you made an out only $15 more
so 432 well I think it's $15 more
looking at the prices on Amazon and that
seems like a you know a great upgrade a
32 gig it's essentially like an SSD yeah
I don't really know enough about it so
I've only done some sort of brief
research and it just didn't seem like it
was worth it but maybe I'm wrong about
that I think it really does depend on
what sort of system you're building yeah
if you have a well yeah if you had a
hard drive then yeah cool
but if you're putting in like a 256 gig
or hot larger SSD is there much point
yeah well I think it yeah like I said I
think it does depend like I think if
you're getting it building a system
that's a lot of hard drives you've got
maybe like as like a silent SSD or low
capacity SSD you can just use apparently
gigabyte obvious with this board has
like just a one-click you to you just
click it and it's immediately caching
you're sort of your games or and
whatever so I think there is at least
some point to it if you were you weren't
spending big on SSDs like you weren't
going to go out and buy the top-end nvme
drives then you're probably going to get
you know some performance gains and that
sort of thing by using opportune but I
think yeah it does depend on the sort of
system you're trying to build there's no
point going all out on SSDs and getting
obtained but at the same time for your
on you know less fast storage than it is
going to make a bit of a difference I
reckon yeah exactly
no it's definitely worth testing and
just the fact that it looks like it is
only a $15.00 premium so it's a hundred
and ninety five dollars us on on Amazon
right now and so yeah that seems that
seems pretty good to me and it is
obviously a higher quality Zed 370 board
as well so yeah I think that's something
to look into when we get back from
Computex for sure yeah I mean the board
the board
really good even though you've got
obtained in there using one of the slots
you've got another em door to slot as
well so it's certainly not like you know
you're buying this board that's got
obtained included and then suddenly you
can't put in another SSD there certainly
is still room for that sort of thing
yeah yeah well to buy that octane drive
separately I think it's about sixty or
eighty dollars somewhere around there
yeah I thought it was about that as much
as well so certainly you know it sounds
like a pretty good deal there from
gigabyte it's really interesting too
because it's a really new board and you
have to wonder sort of like how much of
the market there is for sort of these
obtaining to go to board so be
interesting to see how well that does
mmm put the GPU in go a gigabyte geforce
gtx 1070 TI familiar for some of you who
watched the AMD build in the past we've
got the halo in there it's interesting
how it not if i can get a good shot of
this actually on the second cam because
there's it just Peaks out around the
inside of the fan rings let me move you
out of the way steve a little bit get me
out of here yeah you don't want to be in
the picture anyway do you let me see if
i can rotate this enough horrible sounds
there you can sort of see like in the
top corner there that's the halo coming
out from underneath that fan there that
white ring so i reckon that'll actually
look quite good as far as RGB goes
around fans you know the fan will be
spinning and you'll see that sort of
white area just there okay oh yeah yeah
I can just see it yep yeah and that sort
of top corner yeah and I can be pretty
cool well it'll look impressive for him
out the back of the case he's on the
mainstream this is why I meant to show
on the camera over there so hopefully
you guys could could see that in there
yeah
so interesting interesting product at
least so let's put the graphics card in
and get the power supply in and then you
get in there then you've just got to
look abling to do yeah that's the fun
part people are gonna love watching that
that'll be the part where I in the last
AMD build I basically just shoved all
the cables in the back then I had like
the controllers and stuff just floating
in the back there and when I was editing
the video together I was like oh my god
this looks so bad like putting look like
not only what I was doing on camera
looked bad but also the finished product
look really bad so I was just like I'm
just gonna hide all of that and not show
it on camera because it looked just
awful good choice well I think for the
first few system builds I do on the
channel I spent ages on the cable
management in the back and got it all
looking quite neat and tidy yeah and
then five minutes after that when it was
actually being used as a test system I
had to cut away all the cable ties and
it took me so long to get it back to NC
State where I could just swap things in
and out quite quickly so yeah cable
management it's not super high on the
priority list of test system builds well
certainly for this one because I mean I
probably get better I'll at some point
but certainly for this one for the
moment it's kind of like Justin let's
get it finished yeah get it finished and
get up working that'll be the key here
any news on thread Ripper 2 yet just
wondering 2nd gen thread Ripper well Tim
and I discussed this we're both
expecting it to be announced or at least
seen a copy Tex yeah not sure whether it
be properly announced but we'll
definitely be able to see the boards I
reckon
yeah I'm pretty certain we'll see X 4x
499 boards and then what is it the Z 490
so no idea about that obviously be for
50 boards they're gonna be awesome where
it really came to see those expecting to
see them anyway what part of Australia
from where both from Victoria so so I
live in Melbourne Steve lives in the
middle of nowhere
yeah that's that's true hey good you got
a nice view out from your house I get a
view of a street you get three minutes
rolling hills looks really good actually
yeah I've seen cells at the post on
Instagram I think it's benchmarks in
okay so what are you up to now I'm just
cleaning out some of this stuff clean
out some of the screws I don't need any
more just so that we can have a bit more
space here and to do the finally said it
is its it said it is said yeah z3 70
they wants to say Z Z I'll come on Iraq
since it's hard for us we have to think
about saying Z yeah yeah it's hard
enough saying cash instead of cash yep
something I was looking up that whole
cash cash thing is it only Australia
that says cash and everyone's - or
Ferrari or whatever yep yep that's right
yeah yeah so that's why I've changed
saying cash because 90% of our audience
knows what I'm talking about then so
makes sense
people always pull you up if you say
cash yes exactly
on a scale of one to 499 how stupid our
motherboard names right now motherboard
naming Oh mother
yeah I suppose motherboard names are
probably the least stupid thing though I
mean I know everything is gaming in it
now but you know but obviously monitors
laptops that Timo's I deal with a lot
the namings a lot worse their monitor
names I don't know how they come up with
them just they're painful the numbers
and letters sort of thing so here's for
you guys on the stream here sort of what
we've been doing so far it's really dark
in there unfortunately mmm that's always
a challenge lighting up the inside of a
case
ya know me I put the lights a bit closer
but to light the whole thing a bit more
difficult but yeah you could sort of see
that we've got most of the stuff in so
far I've definitely got the graphics
card the motherboard the RAM we've got
the cooler on the
quite good got the be quite logo up the
right way as well so that's nice
yep very good it's looking very stealth
in there at the moment so definitely got
the intake fancy you got the outtake
fans and everything is going to be RGB
so much RGB they've got this enormous
bundle of front cables I think this
cases has RGB on the front as well so
just an unbelievable amount of cabling
to go yep they'll get you busy for a bit
longer yet I don't know how long the
strings been going for at this point but
well over an hour yeah quite a while and
now in 45 minutes at this point okay
might be halfway hopefully halfway I'm
hoping to get it finished relatively
soon but we'll soon find out that's for
sure
are they addressable RGB so can you
control them by a software is it just a
switch they've got a control well are
you talking about the case or about one
tell us about any of the RGB so I think
the case here has got a controller on
the back that has all sorts of things on
it it's hard to say exactly but they've
certainly got a cable that goes to your
PC's RGB header okay and that attaches
to the LEDs found around the case so
okay and that also attaches to the fans
as well so there's multiple ways to sort
of hook that up so you've got an a PWM
header that goes to your motherboard
you've got a power header and you've
also got a an RGB header so I think
those are the main ways that you're
controlling it and that's the LAN and
then the other stuff the Halos thing as
well has just an RGB cord going to it
just this one here as well as a fan
header and I think that just does
whatever but
it does support things like you know or
a sink MSI sink it says on here and
that's similar for a lot of the RGB
products or supporting those sort of
different protocols we should put
together quite a coordinated light show
for everyone at the end of the stream
then
oh yeah hopefully let's get this power
supply and when I put my trusty knife or
two dollar Bunnings box cutter is it
behind you yeah I've got it what's the
difference screen Aziz and Brutes Aziz
are the British Cowboys that's quite
straight power 11
this is their new range from be quiet
and apparently they're going to have a
thousand watt eight 57 56 55 54 54 to
the manual okay that's a good range but
certainly certainly very new that's for
sure
it's also been happening Steve
anything exciting no I'm just I'm
focused on Computex at this point I'm
really keen to get over there and start
checking out in the new year so yeah
definitely yeah just nothing out of the
ordinary just watching uh watching you
do your livestream mostly fun stuff yes
indeed I've just lost the chat I found
it again alright a power supply looks
quite good a bit of weight to it that's
what you always want to see and modular
as well on the back so very very nice
that's fully modular is it yeah fully
modular fully modular this is the bundle
of cables that you get I laughter wait
20 seconds before I can see them but
yeah that's true is it worth Lauren the
timings with my 3200 CL see probably not
like skylake doesn't really respond to
that well too low and tommy's I mean
it'll certainly help I just don't know
to what degree are you talking about
improving gaming performance it depends
on your GPU if you don't have like a GTX
today you see oh then it's probably not
worth tightening your timings up
definitely anything slower than a GTX
1080 you won't see a single frame extra
so yeah I wouldn't worry about that too
much actually the video on Saturday sort
of covers that in a lot more depth so
keep your eyes peeled for Saturday's
video and what else we got here
are you guys going joining the Japan
bandwagon after Computex I'm not aware
of any Japan bandwagon after Computex
but no we'll be rushing back because we
have a huge amount of videos that we
have to get back into so yep yeah
Computex is almost like a holiday for us
because it's a break from normal content
but uh yeah plenty of things we have to
rush back to Australia you gotta start
covering again Steve what is the mega
unboxing coming back unboxing boxes I
assume you're referring to yes that
sounds like that's the one you're
referring to I'm hoping to do an
unboxing boxes episode probably the
first week that I get back from comedy
texts I join a few parts piling up at
the moment some of them are under NDA so
yeah but I hope to do one so it's just
been a bit busy at the moment
all right don't need VGA 2k what else
cables do I need I need the eight pin
power supply one feature level three and
II don't need that one so this is the
this is the fun part of the build
everyone so this is the edge of your
seat sort of stuff where silver tables
yeah edge ESC or edge of your old
grandma chair hey I like the old Grande
much as you've got to talk to Corsair
and see if you can get one of their t1
race chairs they're pretty good I like
mine so well we'll get to my real chair
soon
I'm sure they'll hook us up right surely
I think so yeah
I'll Street them off an email now going
with the fan mount towards the bottom
cuz you can get a lot of nice amount of
clearance at the bottom there for the
power supply yeah well with that
basement section it looks like they
wouldn't be much if you weren't sucking
cool there from outside of the yeah it's
very tight clearance yeah so you'd sort
of have to do that wouldn't you yep
that's all right the power supply will
self cool itself
I suppose yep itself what do you think
about next Intel desktop CP release will
they add more cores and threads well the
next CPU to come out of Intel we believe
will be their eight core coffee-like CPU
and rumors suggest that the base clocks
and whatnot are going to be quite low on
that one so that'll be interesting to
see how that one goes
but as for the next generation well
sounds like they're struggling on that
one doesn't it Tim with a 10 nanometer
yeah lots of points with 10 down area it
sounds like it sounds like the whole
node is broken fundamentally yes so hard
to say what when and what to expect
there because the mobile parts that are
releasing initially till yields improve
don't look too impressive so now they
can take the GPU to work no it's a bit
bit troubling I'm really hoping there's
that they can get that all sorted out
because we obviously want to continue to
see a really good competition because
the last thing we want to see is then
AMD start to dominate and then don't
expect a me to keep prices low of that
of that's sorry don't expect a me to
keep pricing for their higher core count
CPUs too low if they're dominating Intel
yeah that's right
but I think we're a long way from that
happening just yet but we'll see how it
unfolds is Russia making their own CPU
but yeah not too up to speed on that one
Russia's new a CPU
well maybe I don't know at first I'm
hearing over if they are modular CPUs
yes well in I mean depends how you
define modular CPU but in a way yeah
Rison is a modular CPU design and so if
you're made in that sense then yeah
that's definitely the future and I'd say
four GPUs as well so and AMD's obviously
put themselves under a good position to
take advantage of that
so Intel is definitely gonna have to do
something similar and that's what you'll
really see the playing field level yeah
Intel projects that they're our first
iteration of ten nanometer will be slow
in the current 40 nanometer so Intel's
come out and said that's that will be
the case so we're not going to be seeing
any increase in performance with the
next generation possibly a decrease but
I'd say they're trying to evade that
while they're seeing these lone mobile
parts come out first they'll wait till
they can get to a point where they can
at least match that performance that
we're seeing now of just waterproof
efficiency
yes I've found a flaw with this case
just at the moment that there is no way
to route the CPU power cord just behind
the motherboard so that it comes out in
the top corner oh really
yeah there doesn't seem to be like a
little outlet hole or anything for that
and it won't the cord won't actually fit
through the sometimes they're a bit of a
tight squeeze you want to wriggle them
through but yeah it's got a really
actually might be able to put it in yeah
put it in sideways now yeah it's going
through yeah and sometimes you have to
separate the sort of two four pins yep a
lot of cases are like that it's it's a
hot rod yeah yeah all right what else do
I need I need when you start talking for
the first time in a while Tim you've got
to start whispering initially because
she Dane goes right up when you don't
talk Oh does it that's annoying yeah so
just whispered to adduce um I am what is
it a ASMR initially Alexa and then we'll
do some rustling of the rustling of
packets and stuff it's an ASMR yeah do a
three-hour live stream of that table
love it thinking wouldn't be fun to make
an ASMR PC video not sure I don't know
about that one just opening packets
so what are you doing the sauna camels
at the moment I'm just getting all the
fan cables on the back here just plug
that into the fan header I've got we are
edging mirror
I hate SM our unboxing that would
actually be pretty funny
I totally up for some ASMR unboxing
maybe we can do a silly one on the the
patron channel yeah that would be funny
I reckon a bit of fun
you always gotta have some videos some
fun videos like that to break up all the
rest of the stuff indeed the cables
through to the front so I'm currently
doing at the moment just in case anyone
is wondering 2600 kV vs. 2600 X video
man I've been asked to do that a lot but
yeah that could be a throwback Thursday
I imagine the 2600 would still stand up
quite well still a bit of a beast
especially since today's games don't
often pull for much more than a
quad-core especially if they've got SMT
technology
Oh what so there is some 3.5 ml hard
drive bays on the back here but not
gonna be using those no have you've got
you've got a chute shorter half inch SSD
don't you I do one of the last things to
put in we've got the t force SST such an
RGB SSD but there's I don't believe
there's any SSD mounting on the front
here can you put it on top of the shroud
I could just chuck it here the PSU
shroud usually you can mount them on top
of the PSU shroud or yeah I mean there's
some it's like some plastic things you
can remove here but there they appear to
be more for airflow okay well you could
you could use some adhesive tape to
stick it next to the motherboard tray or
yeah I could just put it in the bottom
here as a yeah let's do that
why not cool aha GB SSD there's
certainly I think you have a lot of
different things these days yeah
everything's got to have RGB on it or
it's not worth selling apparently yeah
people are complaining about the gain on
your mic is it the windows they're
setting for your recording device in the
windows there wasn't any gain on it to
begin with
but obvious every turn software control
off and stuff like that though I thought
I did I thought ideas so let me have a
look here I'm not even sure you can set
it in OBS to have that feature
no but window well yeah I don't know we
know such weird things sometimes though
yeah you're right
you're right might also be just from
looking down as well because as I look
into the microphone for example so this
is the this is the RGB SSD and they've
got this massive RGB zone at the front
here and it comes with the USB cable as
well this is for the RGB cable as well
as the regular stuff so this is just
your standard you know four pin RGB
header and you've got a there's a 3-pin
connector as well for some reason
interesting yeah right so you can
control the RGB that cable let's get out
this side of cable as well or SATA
depending on where you live
SATA solder it's the same thing flat to
flat I reckon just can you minimize my
window for a moment I've just got to go
and get a delivery yeah sure cool I'll
be back in a minute all right Steve's
having fun obviously at the moment with
this sort of stuff
ah what else is going on at the moment
guys in the chat certainly has been some
interesting fun doing a livestream for
the first time
plus the SSD the SATA cable through for
the SSD as well it's looking a bit messy
at the back here but you know what can
you do I guess you're getting there I
are certainly getting there certainly
getting there let's put you back on the
screen as well there you know how's your
parcel anything interesting ah can't say
can you I'm not sure I'm just checking
now I don't think it's a release product
yeah excuse me yeah I think it's under
NDA so all right well can't talk about
that then except you can kind of see
what it is on the stream not sure that
helped much anyway doesn't matter it's
in the box
so whatever all right what questions
have I missed here doing some riveting
cable management around the back here
I'm gonna put this down make sure
everything's fixed into place before you
lay it down sorry
make sure everything's fixed into place
before you lay it down you don't want
the power supply falling out the back or
something oh no I definitely did screw
everything and the only thing that's
floating around is the SSD at the moment
okay plug in some front headers and so
forth assisting later now it's just a
matter of trying to find where all the
stuff is which CPU fits perfectly to a
1070 TI you've won at least something
like the core i5 8400 or be rising 526
either of them would be suitable choices
for H and 70 ti yeah either then be fun
actually I am very hungry
that was the problem with having this uh
stream delay to be neither us about
lunch yet no I'm at lunch oh well what
can you do no what front USBC this case
that front USB EC oh it does oh that's
neat and I assume the motherboard has a
header for it it does indeed it has USB
3.1 gen2 USB C on the back and I think
you can get you know at least USB 3.1
gen2 on on the front awesome that's for
the SSD also we got around here that we
need to put in
sounds like you've just developed on
everything done I should put in the
motherboard power cable how about that
do the easy one yep slam that in and I
think it's so much when tema lowers his
head I think it's just when he doesn't
talk for a while and then he he starts
to talk I think they gain just it's it's
definitely on automatic it's definitely
winding up yeah
talking I have to go see what's the
situation with that next time we do one
of these streams and make sure that
we're not gonna get owned by the audio
yeah
well we'll work it out guys will work it
out but yeah as a warning probably crank
those headphones down a little bit
question why are graphics cut why why
graphic our price is high strong game
Ninja is asking sorry they're high
because of well lots of reasons memory
shortages flash memory prices as a
result then cryptocurrency mining so
demand on the actual graphics cards
themselves they're coming back down they
it's it's not really another ideal
situation but it has improved since the
start of the yep basically demand is the
reason why prices are high and
you can blame that on limited supplies
foes that haven't been out they have
another brand power supply because of
the memory choice and graphics cards
name memory I had they have a cold
recently for my kids enough my heart's a
bit soul anyway we will persevere don't
feel so too bad the spiders how do you
find the spiders at your area Tim hmm
don't really get too many out in the in
the city areas which is good you know I
mean obviously there's a lot of deadly
spiders and so forth so it's just a
matter of avoiding those yep definitely
12-volt RGB let's get that in yeah we
have a few red backs and things out my
way but I've never ever been bitten by
one thankfully thankfully I never do if
you are if you don't see videos for a
while one of the red backs got me yep
so yeah well another one down what else
have we got
yeah this channel needs a live stream
once every week yeah that'd be pretty
good fun we could probably do one every
fortnight at this stage but yeah we'll
see we'll see we'll see
I think the if the PC build that Tim is
doing right now for you guys have
enjoyed this dream we could definitely
start doing this as a monthly occurrence
what do you think Tim yeah I think
that'll be fun lot of fun
I would definitely drive to your place
though next time I would have driven
today it's just the whole Computex thing
and getting ready for that we just have
a lot of work on our plate yeah we can
fly out but yeah what have been a lot of
fun to uh turn up and then maybe we can
order some pizza and that's when we do
the Q&amp;amp;A when we're actually having some
lunch
yep no one has died from a spinal an
Australian life decades well that is
good to know I wonder I know there are
fatalities for snakes
I think there are quite a few yeah
snakes snakes are certainly more deadly
at this way than the spiders yeah yeah
yeah you just more likely to get bitten
by one if you happen to stand on one yep
if you happen to stand on a spider it
usually doesn't go so well for the
spider yeah
standing with snakes avoid the wall
thankfully I'm not at all scared of
spiders so that one won't ever get me to
turn around
but anyway need the audio issues solved
before more more live streams definitely
so that's our one will do with you Nick
with the other patrons but a bit of a
work in progress you know just to make
sure that yeah these things do okay yeah
well we've probably got to invest in a
dedicated streaming setup as well I mean
we've got a few of the parts yeah
probably a dedicated stream PC and your
studio would work well that's another
build video we can do
yes exactly
endless build videos this cable
management is not gonna look good just
warning everyone it's alright it's a
live stream if you to do it cable
management is the most time-consuming
part of any build by far for you to do
that care management properly it's over
an hour it's at least an hour
I'm just routing cables doing them over
again and yeah anyway it's the least fun
part of any build yep
okay well Stu I need to put in I've got
this RGB thing over here so we got here
has just cook up you tell me yeah I
think it needs it an adapter let's take
a look are you going to live punch mark
this PC I mean I suppose Tim could we
talked about this the other day and live
benchmarking is significantly more
boring than it sounds but I don't know
maybe that's something that you guys do
want to see and will enjoy and we can do
but yeah we can look into that I don't
know I think there's still be some
interest for some live benchmarking even
if you say might be a bit boring yeah
while we can definitely give it a go no
it doesn't have to try hopefully yeah
Tim Steve how many years has it been
since your very first moment with PC
gaming and what was it for me it was a
very long time ago unfortunately and I
don't remember the third the first PC
game I played seriously was definitely
the DOS version of command &amp;amp; Conquer
loved that but I think I'd played the
SimCity games before that and probably a
few other older games but command &amp;amp;
Conquer was when I really got into PC
gaming what about you Tim what was the
question first PC game
yeah when how long ago did you get into
PC gaming ah ages ago I think probably
the around the time I bought my first PC
which would have been a long time ago at
least ten years ago now so that's gonna
like original Assassin's Creed sort of
era in terms of games but yeah
you know before that I think Star Wars
Battlefront the to the first Star Wars
Battlefront 2 that came out by 2005 was
probably the one that really got me into
it I think okay what PC was that that
you built do you remember the first one
hmm oh it had like an 8
d like an Amy Radeon HD 4850 or
something from back back then had like
ok or 2 Duo sort of processor very
entry-level sort of system I didn't have
like a huge budget to build it so
certainly back and that was sort of like
what I was getting yep
no it's well that's why I sort of still
like doing those kind of videos and
content because that's what a lot of our
viewers are doing they're not
necessarily all buying the most high-end
gear so it's fun playing around with the
Lauren's stuff yeah for sure a lot of
you know a lot of that's one of the
reasons why had so much fun with the AMD
ap use that was really cool that's cuz
yeah cliff asked that what oh he asked
me what my first PC bill was I've
answered that a few times on a monthly q
and A's but basically it was a seller on
300 a overclocked to about 450 somewhere
between 450 and 500 megahertz don't
remember how much RAM it had it would
have been a very small amount it had a
16 megabyte voodoo Banshee graphics card
from creative labs of all places and
that was on and a open motherboard I
think it was open Arabia I can't
remember I worked it all that a while
ago from some old old photos I had
anyway that was um I played commander
conker on that computer and loved it and
that was an AGP graphics card so the
first generation of AGP graphics cards
oh really
yeah that was kind of cool from PCIe so
not PCI Express ECI
all right I found the header where this
thing goes
they're stealing the adapter for that
it's fun trying to find where other RGB
headers are on things these days mm-hmm
WMD Tech asks just what I asked a
question I want to overclock my ram
through 2933 do I need to upgrade my
files to the latest rebel rebel Ridge so
it's obviously an APU
well you don't necessarily need to
update your biased overclock your memory
it just depends on the kind of memory
you have and how high it will go and how
good the memory controller in your Raven
Ridge chip is but updating advice is
always a good thing to do when you're
sort of doing something like the first
time just make sure nothing's
overclocked when you do update the BIOS
maybe even load these safe defaults and
then do the update but yeah depends on a
few things that you've got there as to
how far you can go
how's it all going Tim it's looking like
you're getting there yep
just making sure that everything is
looking good
deep cover just gave us $5 thank you
very much for that much appreciated
hello what is the best arrow hula I can
get from my own 700 I have the Corsair H
110 I and I've got temps from 38 see 240
sale Idol can I get better tips more
than sufficient I'm not a problem at all
there yeah let us know it's the 8700 all
the 8700 K but if it's 8700 then your
corset H 110 I will be perfectly fine
why is the Intel Core i5
8600 processor at 100% in battlefield
one hmm I wouldn't have expected it to
hit a hundred percent but that's
possible as long as you're not seeing
any mad stuttering or whatever then
that's fine a hundred percent load is
necessarily bad yeah
which lights humming is that mine or is
it Tim's or which one's loud which one
is the bad gaze at me or Tim you guys
are complaining about the audio it look
seem too much hum on at least there
it's just when they gain winds up on
your mic it's definitely on auto so if
we can we we 100% want to fix that for
next time
yep yeah they're saying it's Tim's I
hear it wind up like yeah you get some
serious feedback but anyway we will fix
this for next time guys promise we'll do
even more testing even though that
didn't actually work for this time yeah
I wonder since you're mostly standing
over the the table there you possibly
should have just used the NT mic yeah I
was thinking about that how hard is that
to plug in and just swap over the mics
oh yeah could plug it in and I'd try
that because if it's it's wrecking the
quality of the stream it only take you a
second to change it all right let me go
get it we'll see how this goes well well
basically what we're gonna do is we're
gonna use Tim's mic that is his
studio-grade mic that's directly over
him so when he plugs that in hopefully
it'll sound better so he's just doing
that now so now you've just got me so
that sucks
I'm not actually listening to the stream
I could just hear Tim on skype and it
was quite bad so I imagine on the stream
it sounds pretty nasty but you again
sorry about that
testing testing 1 2 3 up yes it's miles
better yeah way better way better way
better it is a better bike yeah
well it's also not attached to your body
which is helpful yeah I think it might
pick you up through the feedback a
little bit more than the other Mike was
going to though it should be more
directional oh yeah it depends I think
it does pick up most of this stuff
though and it's also doing the stream
now fun stuff and that's not ideal but
whatever it's better than feedback I'm
just listening to a stream down alright
let me just take out this mic anyway
we'll see what whatever what's
everyone's saying about house than you
might guys if we improve things I made
them worse should I think we also need
to plug in at the moment it's any of
these RGB headers that I'm trying to
find the RGB header for
this would an RGB controller actually
Zed Zed are Hardy just gave us $5 thanks
mate roughly what CP utilization level
does GPU performance start taking it
here
well basically anything under in ninety
nine hundred percent soon as you start
dropping down GP utilization you will
straightaway see a reduction in frame
rate the percentage obviously depends on
what the current frame rate is but for
maximum performance the utilization as
high as possible so avoid those cpu or
other system all X ok everyone saying
the audio is much better much improved
so cool that's good that's good it's
very good we should have done that a
while ago how did you guys not the idea
to the harbor box channel um I've
explained that a few times on the Q&amp;amp;A
just really briefly some of you may
remember the original host Matt and that
is a good friend of mine he wants to do
the channel I didn't he sort of
convinced me to help him start it so I
did and then I actually really enjoyed
it so I started helping him a lot with
it and we started doing it together and
then after about a year and a half
Matt sort out you realize that it's just
and yeah a few things changed in his
life and he decided I want to catch it
with it so I decided to take over and
then Jim joined me last year what is
creating the auto game whether it's your
preamp or whether it's the software it's
still doing it that's apparently yeah
yeah yeah it's anyway okay I have to
work out what is changing Tim's gain
yeah I don't know don't know what is
going on there yeah well I think it must
be on the computer side for sure yeah oh
well not much we can do about right now
but we'll sort it out for next time yeah
um just trying to figure out where do
you these RGB headers they plug straight
into the motherboard right they're
generally at the very bottom of the
boards yeah yeah yeah I've found them
but they seem to not be going into well
they may only go they they will only go
one way to work so make sure that
there's probably a little arrow or
something on the connector that you have
to line up
yeah I'm just there's a five pin one
like 12 to 12 G RBW ones mm-hmm
and I've got four pin connectors and it
just seems like that's not fitting -
well you want a five pin for it to use
the the gigabyte lighting feature I
would have thought yeah so I've got that
the SSD is for pin and this one uses a
different connector the Hale uses a
different connector I found that's fine
it's need to plug that in and then
there's this other one for the control
which is so gone somewhere that's also a
four pin
yeah just twelve GRB
that's it and I can find two 5-pin ones
on this board but I haven't as yet been
able to find a 4-pin RGB header okay in
your arm when you get a second in your
Skype settings did you have
automatically adjust microphone settings
enabled or not for your mic
well you're still talking to your you're
talking to me through Skype as well
though like were we having these game
problems when Skype wasn't part of the
stream I don't remember yeah I don't
think so
so I'm wondering from Skype that's
messing it up but yeah this could be for
a different board considering these are
for aura and for a Susan MSI RGB
controllers so maybe I'll just leave
those unplugged sometimes there are in
the packet that you get with it like
accessories there's a like an adapter
cable that can suit different
motherboards but quickly jump into your
Skype or audio settings and then just
make sure that automatically adjusts
microphone settings is unticked yeah
okay let me just get rid of your screen
so though I'm not don't you show your
address or anything while the driving
out here known as the fuel for that boy
don't you just love Skype love it
so where would I find this setting does
it exist yeah yeah yeah go to options
tools options using the Skype Windows
Store app oh yeah that's probably your
first mistake
it's been fine for everything else
except for we want to do a live stream
on the channel yeah that's right then
again the audio does seem to be coming
from my audio capture device rather than
yours
hmm yeah well it's something we'll have
to fix for next time all right I think
this is all or good these these RGB
things they're for a different
motherboard which is fine
I think the yeah this this SSD should be
okay but the rest of the stuff not so
let me just find the appropriate cable
for that point you can denser mic picks
up a lot more surrounding audio than the
our lapel did yeah that's true it's
better anyway than what we were using I
think
keep it anyway
let me see that this yep oh good oh good
I'm just checking out that manual for
that board
did it yeah yeah I see that problem what
is making that problem let me have a
look in the sound settings
all right let's have a look at this
manual here
as far as I can tell it only has the two
headers at the bottom of the board yeah
so I'm not sure about that one
interesting okay well I've still got one
header to put in I found I found one
just got to put this one
yeah this is definitely the right it's
definitely the right one it's just
really difficult to get it in don't know
why that's the case though well you have
to worry about a lot of tree much just
get the system up and running
I'll give it one last shot and if that
doesn't work then I'll give up yeah
whatever it's just our GPU later you can
sort that out later
all right I think everything is plugged
in then except for those RGB headers
that's ok got the 24 in power connector
in now power cable I'll put the
motherboard power cable in it's all done
that'll come in handy later all right
let's find us a power cable and plug it
in i guess i should probably plug it
into a display as well yeah if you have
one handy that will definitely be useful
seen the posts michael says RGB is
overrated Tim yeah well yeah that's
power cable it's not long enough you may
have a fork in power board there ready
yep now go
all right
I'll turn it on about having a
collective you know display so I can
actually see if it's posting or not but
not you being there looks not too bad
this SS thing is crazy look at that
that's just ridiculous how it looks okay
in there
I had the SSDs very well lit up yeah see
what the board lit up we got the RAM lit
up
it's just that or a thing here that
wasn't quite lit up at the time but
apart from that we've also got the
lighting on the front that seems to be
working so certainly got a very orange
system on your hands that is right that
is rice I will have to check though to
see whether it's actually posting
otherwise we've got a problem so let me
just find so I'm gonna unplug your
stream Steve and take a look so we're
working let me just see so Steve has
died on us at the moment I think he's
got Scott still since his Skype call is
still going through am I still here I
think you're still there
oh that's that's something okay let me
do this a good
let's go through the boot here on this
your cable management is better than
NBN's that's funny oh it's pretty bad
yeah it's it's burning I've got a screen
off-camera but it's taking the Auris
bore at the moment down here so we're
good cool good stuff so I think that
probably is gonna conclude this stream I
reckon yeah well they're probably too
annoying and someone obviously a deduce
I think the guys at PC case key we're
using that SSD for something before this
ah it's got windows on it does it yeah
it does it's boom straight into windows
free-school yeah I mean we'd probably
keep doing questions and Miss around for
a bit more but if the audio is really
bad there's probably no point will go
away and solve that for next time
yeah we'll see what's going on they're
really not sure what the cause of that
is I've looked in the window settings
I've looked on the the audio recording
device and everything it just seems that
there's something a bit screw up with it
yeah it's just it's probably happened we
haven't streamed since the windows
update so yeah it's probably a setting
in there the new mixer or something
that's causing us some issues or it's
just Skype is I think the stream was
fine before you called me so I think
it's probably Skype messing it up yeah
yeah so definitely the cable management
can do with a bit of a bit of an
improvement err on that front but look
this case I quite like the lighting on
the on the case at the front with the
sort of light straight streaks on either
side it looks good which you can sort of
see there so you get those on both sides
looks good it's a good case it's got
some nice sort of cable management
features on the back that you can sort
of wrap cables into and keep them held
in there so that's been good all the
fans seem good we just need to solve why
there's that fantex halos thing wasn't
there now do you also have this RGB set
of RGB strips that I'll also try and
chuck in there and figure out if that
can be connected somewhere I'm sure it
can be
but yeah it seems to be working well and
looking very very nice you've now got
yourself a Verizon and coffee like test
system that's that is true that is very
very true so if there's any other
questions in the chat we'll take a few
more questions for a little bit and then
say goodbye to this very very long
stream that's being how long we up to
now two hours oh okay yep quite a while
two hours and a half ah sitting down for
the first time a couple of hours
well I answered a lot of questions as we
were doing it yeah yeah so scooter says
is it a five volt or 12 volt RGB header
the SSD has a 5 volt header on it so the
motherboard also has a 5 volt header
that I plugged it into on that this be
quite thing up here has a I think it has
a 5 volt header on it as well but I
plugged in a 4 volt adapter to it so I
probably just have 2 or a 4 pin adapter
sorry to it so I just have to go and
swap that out and plug it back in
properly and then they're like
controller I think has a 5 volt the
light control for the case has a 5-4 pin
4 pin on it 4 pin that's the one I'm on
it potentially with an adapter somewhere
that I haven't it's in this whole bunch
of stuff probably somewhere but it
should be possible to get all the idea
be working I think just not right now
yeah fair enough
oh good effort
so yeah interesting enough yeah I'm
trying to preserve my voice anyway so
it's probably good that we're getting to
the end here yeah that is true that is
true
got to keep it ready for Computex still
that's it's a few days to recover yet
then we'll be right yeah yeah that's
true
yeah well I think we can probably end
that one there unless anyone's got a few
last-minute questions yep but like I
said I did answer quite a few during the
stream and thanks to all those guys that
did make donations much appreciated
that'll go towards buying some better
streaming gear for next time yeah yeah
definitely definitely big big shout out
to all the people that were watching
this from especially those of you that
watch it from start to finish for some
bizarre reason it was a bit of fun and
yeah thanks to gigabyte helping us out
with this particular build providing us
with that motherboard that has obtained
with it definitely check that out
especially because it's only $15 premium
on the regular borders it turned out and
help you speed up here speed up
everything and it seems like a good
quality board and Intel for providing a
700 K and PC case gear for providing the
rest of this stuff thanks to guys like
be quiet and fantex and team team force
whatever it's called t4m group group
timber team group tee force I think is
the brand that's correct
so that's that's right cool well thanks
for joining me Steve as well I'm
spending the last hour of your life on
this it was good fun enjoyed it so I'm
looking forward to doing you next time
hopefully I better do it in person with
you so that should probably help with
the audio yep it should be alright
well thanks everyone and we'll see in
