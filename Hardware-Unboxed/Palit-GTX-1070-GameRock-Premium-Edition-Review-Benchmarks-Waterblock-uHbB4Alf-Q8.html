GT X 1080 graphics card I laid my hands
on was the game with Phoenix goes like
Hal edition even today it's still one of
the best examples I've seen in fact I
like it so much I've been gracious
enough to grant a permanent residence in
my personal gaming rig we both seem
pretty happy with the arrangement
recently palette reached out and asked
if I could review their gtx 1070 gamer a
premium edition naturally I obliged for
those of you aren't aware gaming a
pallet of one and the same the game wood
version this graphics card is called the
gtx 1070 phoenix GLH palette then threw
in a twist or rather a much welcomed
bonus included with the graphics card
was a bits power vga waterblock which
you might have already seen if you watch
the unboxing boxes episode last week
bits power make blocks for brands such
as gigabyte MSI and ZOTAC it now appears
that pallet slash game web can be added
to that list as well the supply block is
designed to suit their gtx 1070 and 1080
graphics cards I have to assume they
don't have the 1070 model ready yet as I
was sent the model with the 1080 logo so
I guess this 1070 will be playing
dress-up anyway before we strip the game
on premium edition down to its PCB and
slap on the waterblock
let's take a quick look at the stock
cooler as well as the PCB design as was
the case with the game with GT X 1080
you'll notice right away we have a very
large graphics card on hand the PCB
measures 267 millimeters long and the
card stretch is a further 18 millimeters
thanks to the oversized cooler this huge
cooler takes up not 2 but rather 3 slots
at 48 millimeters thick
in comparison the thousands Edition
cooler measures 35 millimeters thick and
266 millimeters long more typical
dimensions for a dual slot graphics card
the PCB is also 20 millimeters taller
than standard allowing the graphics card
to stand 133 millimeters tall under the
large fan shroud which I should point
out has been constructed from plastic
with anodized aluminium trimmings we
find - truly massive heat sinks in total
there's 120 millimetres by 185
millimetres at 30 millimeters thick
worth of heatsink improving efficiency a
3/8 millimeter copper heat pipes along
with an additional 2 6
two copper heat pipes these heat pipes
are also connected to a large copper
base pushing large volumes of air over
the huge head sink surface area are two
100 millimeter fans these fans are
extremely quiet and even when the card
has been placed under load for an
extended period the rework PCB features
an 8 + 2 phase power design which was
also seen on the GTX 1080 model pallet
has stuck with the standard 8 pin PCIe
power connector though out of the box
the car comes clocked at 1670 megahertz
for the base with the boost clock of
1873 megahertz the memory has been
boosted to 2,000 125 megahertz taking
the throughput from a gigabytes per
second to 8.5 gigabytes per second
around the back we find a huge full-size
backplate protecting the card though the
aluminium plate is pre boring in terms
of design the i/o configuration remains
standard with a single dual link DVI
output HDMI 2.0 B and three display
ports now that we've checked out the
gamer premium edition let's install the
waterblock and see how the therm was
compared to the stock air cooler I
didn't get an instruction manual to go
off but luckily I've done a few of these
by now and it's usually not too tricky I
started by removing every screw within
sight and once that was done the cooler
lifts away easily once a pair of wires
were unplugged this gives us access to
the next few screws that are wholly on
the backplate I proceeded unscrew all of
these and again the card lifted away
from the backplate to next I peeled away
the thermal pads that are on the card
already as it'll be replaced by those
that came with the water block I cut and
applied these to the new shiny water
block as you can see some thermal paste
went on next and I tried to spread that
nice and evenly before plugging in the
RGB power plug in the water block and
laying the card a new backplate on in
position a bunch of black allen key
screws going next to lock everything
into place and voila I went to peel away
the plastic from the cool black dragon
cover next and found that I really
needed to pull all the screws out to get
the last little bits of plastic away but
this was no biggie now the card was all
together it was time to plug her into my
Corp III liquid-cooled build I had so
much fun
draining it and refilling it that I
decided not to put it on camera so all
in all as you can see it's a pretty cool
looking water block with and without the
dragon cover first up in our benchmarks
we have battlefield 4 and here the
Aled gtx 1070 matched the gigabyte
extreme gaming out of the box and was
able to hang with your soos troops once
overclocked we see much the same when
testing with Star Wars Battlefront
pallets gtx 1070 was on par with EA soos
and gigabyte cards out of the box and
overclocked wrapping up the gaming
benchmarks is Far Cry primal and again
we find very much the same results so
nothing unusual to report here them like
the framerate performance just seen the
power consumption of the pallet gtx 1070
is very similar to cars from a susan
gigabyte this means the game Rock
premium edition does suck down quite a
bit more power than the founds Edition
card but with a total system consumption
of just 252 what's it isn't exactly a
power-hungry graphics card out of the
box the pallet gtx 1070 ran it up to 66
degrees when gaming this is quite a bit
warmer than the Asus and gigabyte cards
but it isn't exactly hot either coming
in at 11 degrees cooler than the
founders Edition overclocked
temperatures reached 70 degrees and
again this is very acceptable adding the
bits power water block with the GPU
overclocked reduced the low temperatures
43 degrees which is very impressive the
liquid core configuration was tested in
my custom-built thermal take or p3
system the pallid gtx 1070 game Rock
Premium Edition performed as expected
matching the gigabyte extreme gaming and
a soos ROG Strix cards out of the box
overclocked he received similar
performance to the highly touted a soos
from gigabyte cards as well
unfortunately pallets gtx 10:17 did run
a little bit hotter when gaming though
admittedly and just 66 degrees it's
still a very cool and quiet graphics
card that said if cool and quieter your
thing then the custom design bits power
water block might be worth looking into
as this dropped the operating
temperature this is 43 degrees with the
GPU overclocked the bits power block
also looks awesome and will no doubt be
a prized piece for any do-it-yourself
liquid core setup it hasn't been made
clear if this is just something you can
buy separately or palette will do some
sort of bundle deal where you can buy a
version of this card with the block
pre-installed in any case a cool option
to have either way pricing is difficult
to pin down right now as availability is
very poor parlor cards almost don't
exist in Australia it seems and I can't
find any listed major online retailers
such as New Age either typically game
with slash palette or competitive on
pricing so hopefully this model comes in
nearer videos MSRP
what do you guys think of this palette
card let me know in the comments
