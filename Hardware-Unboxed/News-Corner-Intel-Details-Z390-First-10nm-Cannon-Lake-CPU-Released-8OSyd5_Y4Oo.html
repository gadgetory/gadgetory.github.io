calm design your own custom snap backs
and hats welcome back to the hardware on
box news corner in today's episode we'll
be going through Intel's new Z 390
chipset that they're officially unveiled
earlier in the week news of new CPUs
from Intel and AMD a few interesting
monitor related stories including
updates in the ongoing g-sync HDR saga
and a few graphics card stories to raft
it all out let's get started one of the
bigger news stories from this week
concerns Intel said 390 chipset we've
all known this chips that has been
coming for a while but early in the week
Intel published its product brief
document for the chipset giving us all
the official details maybe until
published this document early by
accident or maybe it was intentional
either way we can now say for sure what
this chipset is providing the first of
the key inclusions is native support for
up to six USB 3.1 gen2 ports the ten
gigabit per second port in case the USB
naming scheme is confusing you like it
confuses everyone said 370 had no native
support for USB 3.1 gen2 while chipsets
like H 370 and Q 370 did so this new
said 390 chipset is simply updating
Intel's highest and standard chipset
with features already introduced on
lower end boards said 390 also includes
integrated support for Intel's Wi-Fi
arrow to point to connectivity which
again we already saw with Intel's lower
end trips including B 360 and H 310
other than those two things there are no
significant changes compared to said 370
is simply a combination of the H 370 q
370 and Zi 370 platforms into the one
top-end chipset that includes nearly
every feature found across those three
chipsets there are of course rumors that
the Zed 390 platform will support
Intel's supposedly upcoming eight called
coffee-like chips
whereas ed 370 will not but that wasn't
confirmed in the latest set of documents
hopefully though eight core coffee-like
is only just around the corner there
were a couple of CPU related news
stories this week firstly it was
announced an AMD partner event that
second generation thread Ripper CPUs a
sampler
now and should be available to all
customers it seems most likely that
these new thread Ripper h EDT chips will
launch in q3 of this year and hopefully
we will see some new motherboards
supporting the platform at Computex as
was previously reported it seems the Red
River will launch in 3 skews the 29 50 X
29 28 and 2900 X all of which should be
upgrades on the similarly named first
gen parts those first gen parts launched
in August of last year so I reckon we'll
see second gen thread repair around the
same time this year the other CPU
related news story of the week concerns
Intel's 10 nanometer cannon Lake line-up
the first cannon like chip was spotted
in a new Lenovo laptop in a Chinese
retailer the IdeaPad 330 this low-end
laptop included a previously unseen core
i3 8121 used CPU along with very basic
specs like a 1366 by 768 display on our
X 540 discrete GPU and 4 gig of ddr4
later in the week Intel published an ARC
page that fully details the core i3 8121
you it's a 10 nanometer coffee Lake CPU
with 2 cores and 4 threads with a base
clock of 2.2 gigahertz the Canterbury up
to 3.2 gigahertz it also has 4 megabytes
of cache and a 15 watt TDP there are no
integrated graphics as this has been
disabled in this particular SKU the CPU
isn't exactly the kickoff to Canon Lake
and 10 nanometers that Intel would have
hoped for it's an even lower end chip
than the kb lake core i3 8130 you built
on 14 nanometers offering lower clock
speeds and no integrated GPU in the same
15 watt TDP until of course has had a
lot of problems with their 10 nanometer
manufacturing node and they are only
shipping 10 animated chips at low volume
right now perhaps only the 81 21 you
hopefully by the time 10 animator wraps
up in 2019 we'll have better CPUs
available on that node the ongoing saga
of g-sync HDR monitors is continuing
despite Nvidia previously stating these
monitors were on track for an April
release in via this we confirm that the
first g-sync hgr monitors are on track
for a release at the end of May if you
can believe them this time this first
rollout will include the 27 inch 4k 144
Hertz HDR displays that will first shown
off at Computex
20:16 ahead of juicing h giles official
announcement at CES 2017 so yeah we've
been wave these modernist for nearly two
years now the model is in question are
the ASA predator X 27 and a soos ROG
script PG 27 UQ although there is also
an IOC model with the same specs that
Nvidia didn't include in this latest
announcement later in the year we are
supposed to get ultra wide g-sync HDR
monitors with a 34 40 by 1440 resolution
and 200 Hertz refresh rates then we
still have no real idea when they're
coming and then there's also the big
format gaming displays with 65 inch 4k
120 Hertz paddles and those currently
have an unknown release date we should
be seeing these panels at Computex 2018
and then hopefully you'll actually be
able to buy at least there 27 inch 4k
144 Hertz models in the next month or so
provided you have several thousand
dollars ready to spend in other display
news the first 4k 120 Hertz displays now
on sale from Korean manufacturer wasabi
mango yep apparently that's a real
company in hang anyway they have a forty
three inch monitor with the 3840 by 2160
resolution and a true 120 hertz refresh
rate the display allegedly supports HDR
although it has just a maximum
brightness of 400 nits and there's no
word on gamut although it does support
10-bit color the panel itself uses IPS
technology with the 1200 to 1 contrast
ratio and 5 milliseconds rated response
times if he interested this panel should
be available at the end of the month for
$1400 unfortunately while the display
does push up to 120 Hertz it doesn't
support free sync or J sync and who
really knows what sort of coffee he can
get from a company named wasabi mango
Samsung is apparently working on a bunch
of new monitors with next-gen displays
they have a stupidly wide 49 inch 50 120
by 1440 VA panel in the works that
pushes up to 120 Hertz which should be a
higher-end option than their current 49
inch 32 9 ultra wide with a 38 40 by
1080 resolution there's also a 43 inch
VA panel with the 38 40 by 1200
resolution and 144 Hertz refresh in the
works and a new 34 40 by 1440 VA panel
with a 144 Hertz refresh slated for q3
2018 for those that enjoy 4k gaming
although as a 30 1.5 inch curved 4k 120
Hertz VA panel that should be ready in
July so all the cool new stuff coming
from Samsung's monitor factory at the
moment MSI has new Radeon graphics cards
in the pipeline under the mech 2 brand
we should say these officially at
Computex in both an Rx 580 and rx 570
variant complete with the cooler that
provides 22% more air pressure or
something anyway
these look like fairly standard AMD
graphics cards but it is interesting
that MSI are pushing out a new brand at
this time on a more interesting note
power color will be showing off a Radeon
rx Vega 56 nano graphics card at
Computex there absolutely no technical
details to go off at this stage but
there is a product image and looks
pretty small as you'd expect from a nano
card it also matches up with the
prototype nano card showing off in
Munich last month that some people
managed to take some pictures off final
news topic for the week call of duty
black ops 4 will be exclusive to
Activision Blizzard's battle.net
platform on PC for the first time this
means no Steam version instead you'll
have to use the battlenet launcher and
purchase a battlenet version considering
steam is still the best platform out
there for gaming this is pretty annoying
to hear at least for me although at
least the game will launch on October
12th and will support things like 4k HDR
and uncapped frame rates yep apparently
those features are worth mentioning as
Activision did so during their by cops 4
announcement live stream a couple of
days ago not the longest news corner of
all time this week seems like we're
getting into the calm before the
Computex storm as always subscribe to
the channel to ensure you don't miss a
single new score an episode that go live
