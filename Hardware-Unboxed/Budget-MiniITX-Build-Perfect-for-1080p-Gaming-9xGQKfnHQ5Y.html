ago now I set out to build a budget mini
ITX gaming rig you know something that
costs well under a thousand dollars u.s.
I was still waiting on a few components
for the build and then I realized I had
these three calm da2
brand-new inbox along with a few other
goodies so my sub $1,000 budget mini ITX
build ended up coming out at $2,200 us
so yeah when I would have been off
mission on that one I did promise though
that I would eventually circle back and
make the mini ITX budget build happen
and well it's only been about four weeks
so all over 30 videos later it's here
it's not that bad is it anyway since
I've made you wait so long I'm not going
to talk you through all the components
now we'll just roll the build footage
and yeah I'll talk about why I selected
these components as we put this little
mini rig together so starting with the
case we have the fractal core 500 it was
either this or the Cougar qbx
and I do really like the look of the qbx
but I couldn't source one in time and PC
case key had a core 500 handy so I just
grabbed that in the US they both cost
around $55 so either works for our
budget in terms of capacity the core 500
is a few litres larger but its footprint
is only slightly larger due to its
design for a relatively compact Mini ITX
case it has an impressive spec sheet it
supports up to two radiators can shove a
280 millimeter or 240 millimeter right
in the top and a 120 millimeter in the
rear also included are magnetic dust
filters support for full ATX power
supplies up to 170 millimeters long and
incredibly up to seven drives so
although I've never built inside the
core 500 I am confident it will work
well for this build moving on to the
brains of the operation and for this we
have Amy's rather than five 2600 and
right now it cost just 165 dollars us
making it an exceptionally good value
all-rounder that'll provide very solid
performance for years to come not only
that but our mini ITX be 450 motherboard
will support up cummings into pros
so this little gaming machine has a rich
upgrade path the only downside here
being the 2600 does only come with the
Wraith stealth box cooler but since I'm
not gonna have a copy system I'll just
stick with that for now perhaps down the
track I can modify the system upgrade
the cooler and do some overclocking so
if you're interested in that please let
me know in the comment section below
then for the motherboard the as rocker
fatality be 450 gaming ITX AC is one of
the cheapest be 450 mini ITX motherboard
available right now and it's a pretty
solid option at $125 us you get Intel
802 11 AC Wi-Fi plus Bluetooth 4.2 Intel
Gigabit LAN real check ALC 1220 audio
codec with support for creative Sound
Blaster cinema 5 for SATA ports and an
ultra m2 port on the rear it's only
weakness is the fat 3-phase vrm it's not
ideal for overclocking but with a risin
v 2600 it won't be an issue and i've run
one of these boards for quite an
extended period of time now with the
horizon 727 hundreds and I've had no
problems at all for the memory I'm
recommending g.skill ripjaws 4 Series
there's 16 gigabyte ddr4 3000 CL 15 kit
is exceptional value at 110 dollars
still if you want to save about $20 you
can do so by getting a CL 17 or 18 kit
but I don't really feel like it's worth
the saving especially not for a rise and
platform then for storage we have the
team group T force Delta a 500 gigabyte
SSD and if you're wondering why I picked
this flashy looking SSD the answer is
simple it's bloody cheap I was initially
going to grab the team group l5 like 480
gigabyte SSD for just $50 but as I was
pricing up the build I found the T force
Delta R 500 gigabyte was selling for
just $46 us making it an insane bug and
sadly right now at least at the time of
filming this video it is sold out in
your egg but even so you can expect to
pay no more than $60 u.s. elsewhere so
it's still a great price for a 500
gigabyte SSD with a little bit of bling
the drive uses the silicon motion SM
2258 controller and PAX 32 layer TLC
based 3d NAND flash from micron so for a
two and a half inch SATA SSD it's pretty
respectable and for
price again it is an incredible by then
powering the builders course scx for 50m
it's simple but effective and at just
fifty dollars this bronze certified
power supply is hard to beat it's a semi
modular power supply and although it
only offers a 450 watt output capacity
that will be more than enough for this
build
still if you're all concerned about this
the 550 watt model costs just $10 more
or the 650 watt model can be had for $20
more now this is of course going to be a
gaming system so we need a gaming
graphics card and the choice here is
pretty obvious for $150 us you simply
can't go past the Radeon rx 570 right
now so we won't right now it is possible
to snap up the gigabyte rx 570 gaming 4G
for $150 but I'd also recommend keeping
an eye out for other models as we have
seen some going on sale for 140 and even
a hundred and thirty dollars for this
build I have these slightly more
expensive
Oris model which sells for a hundred and
seventy dollars it's a nice card but I'd
probably seek out one of the cheaper
models if I'm honest okay so that was a
pretty straightforward build haven't
bothered with any fancy b-roll and he's
sliding shots all that kind of stuff
because well it looks pretty much like
how we started in fact well you can sort
of hear stuff rattling around a lot
heavier but you really wouldn't know
that I'd built anything in it just
looking at it like this because there's
no side windows or anything like that
the i/o shield at the back gives it away
so there you go I'm not filming this you
know out of sequence I'm doing it all in
sequence I've just finished the build I
didn't film this ahead of time with just
the case and look if we take the top off
you can you can see the stuff in there
so anyway I'll just get on with it
basically the build is done I am yet to
plug it in and play some games some keen
to do that but yeah that's it it's the
base configuration I did put a second
SSD in there but I'm not including that
in the cost I just put that in there
because team group were gracious enough
to send along two of them and I'll
probably use the other one for another
bill but I wanted to put it in here and
but I think one 500 gigabyte SSD would
probably be a sufficient for this kind
of build and I do have just the single
fan in the rear there so I haven't put
the I could put two 120 millimeter or I
think even 140 millimeter fans in the
top that would obviously improve
thermals push a bit more air through the
case haven't done that just wanted to
keep the base configuration didn't want
to add $30.00 or whatever for extra fans
so just the basic configuration and well
I think it's about time we go see how it
performs first up let's check out
fortnight yes but not this is a good
build for young gamers getting into
computers after all so I don't think
there's any harm in checking out the old
court night anyway using the higher
quality preset at 1080p the framerate
never dipped below 60 fps in the
demanding 50 V 50 mode and this was late
game with everyone crammed into a small
area for the most part the frame rates
hovered around 70 FPS and occasionally
jumped up to around 90 or even 100 FPS
of course the most important thing being
that the gameplay was extremely smooth
and this made things like aiming quite
easy and this was despite the fact that
I was sitting uncomfortably off to the
side giving the camera the best view of
the action anyway fortnight did run
great and with competitive quality
settings you'd be looking at over 100
yes at all times
then for a drastic change of pace I
fired up f1 2018 and hit the Bahrain
circuit using the maximum quality preset
with ta enabled in that turn your P
frame rates mostly hopping at around 80
to 90 fps with the occasional dip down
to 70 FPS again the experience was great
the game was very smooth and their
visuals were impressive moving on
shuttle the Tomb Raider provided this
little rig with its greatest challenge
yet and although couldn't push 60 FPS
1080p the performance was still decent
and most importantly very playable using
the high quality preset the game looks
amazing and what 40 to 50 FPS was
enjoyable another great looking game is
the recently released Resident Evil 2
and despite the impressive visuals frame
rates using the second highest quality
preset mostly fluctuated between 60 to
70 FPS so good news you can have the
absolute crap scared out of you without
any dropped frames
next up for all you World of Tanks fans
I quickly gave the standalone benchmark
a whirl using the maximum quality
settings at 1080p and I found this
little mini ITX build was able to keep
frame rates above 60fps at all times so
again another smooth and enjoyable
experience
assassins create Odyssey like shuttle of
the tomb right I mostly played it
between 40 and 50 fps also like Tomb
Raider you don't really need a whole lot
of frames in this game to really enjoy
it
that's it with a few small tweaks you
could get a consistent 60 FPS with this
setup
Just Cause 4 is another title we're
achieving an average of 60 fps shouldn't
be that difficult using the maximum
quality settings at 1080p soft frame
rates in the high 40s when driving
around then 60 when walking grappling
and gliding around the environment so
pretty decent performance there
unfortunately overlay software like
rivatuner doesn't work and Forza horizon
4 but the built-in benchmark reported an
average of 67 fps and as you can clearly
see here it played very well especially
given how great it looks
and lastly I fired up hitman is this
isn't a particularly AMD your eyes and
friendly title but I have to say it did
play very well maxed out at 1080p the
framerate said about 60 FPS at all times
and we're often seen hovering around 70
FPS so another solid result here outside
of the usual FPS numbers have to say
really impressed with how the system ran
I was very doubtful of how cool and
quiet it actually would be but yeah
turned out to be very cool and quiet so
again quite surprising that the graphics
card fans spun at about 1700 rpm which
is very similar to what I see on the
open test bench so yeah really
impressive stuff there's not a whole lot
of ventilation in the side panel there
but regales that seemed to work really
well even with just a single 120
millimeter exhaust fan because the
graphics card itself only picked 75
degrees and that was after an hour-long
stress test running f1
2018 on just an endless loop which I ran
for an hour so yeah that's that's a good
temperature there I didn't run any CPU
stress tests anything like blender or a
power bug thing like prime95 didn't do
any of that
it's just focused purely on gaming I
went gaming I think the r5 2600 it
peaked with the Wraith stealth box
cooler at about 65 degrees and I think
the title that did that in was hitman so
walked around those crowds or quite
heavy utilization there on the rise and
5 CPU and yet got 65 degrees which is
very very cool so again considering we
only have a single 120 millimeter
exhaust fan that's really a great result
I'm not even sure how we got such a
great result out of this case because it
doesn't look heavily ventilated not a
lot of air is getting shoved in there so
yeah impressive stuff it's a shame that
a lot of modern cases don't work as well
as this one
not sure what magics going on there but
anyway throwing to more top
120-millimeter or I think 140 millimeter
fans and the top that would obviously
help cram a lot more air through the
case and probably help reduce possibly
the graphics card it would do a lot for
the CPU on the motherboard
sure like the graphics card because
that's on the outside you might have to
open up the side panel to improve that
but honestly you really don't need to
overall I'm really pleased with that
little gaming box has to offer
particularly for the money and while I
suspect in five to six months you'll
probably be able to build something
better I honestly don't think you can go
to wrong with this build if you'll just
to pull the trigger on it now especially
if you're desperate to build a gaming
system you've been holding out but you
heard that we've got the Zen to
processes coming you see all the Navi
rumors that pop up everyday I'd probably
forget about all that stuff and just
build something like this because as I
said you really can't go to wrong and
you there's always the opportunity to
upgrade later to a Zen to processor or
whatever but for 1080p gaming and the
sort of stuff this systems doing it's
really going to be unnecessary also who
knows what could happen to the PC market
in six months time we could have another
horror repeat of 2018 cryptocurrency
makes a comeback and well I don't need
to say any more you guys know what
happens when that sort of thing happens
but I'm not trying to scare anyone I'm
not trying to upset anybody I'm just
saying who knows what will happen I
don't have a crystal ball I don't know
what's gonna happen to the PC market in
six months time all I'm saying is if
you've been if you've been holding out
you're desperate for new gaming rig I
feel like now is a pretty good time to
build one and something like this for
$700 us is what the total build cost
came to you you really can't go to wrong
I don't think you'll be kicking yourself
in six months time and again you can
upgrade so this has a great upgrade path
you can whack us into your processor and
then of course you can upgrade the
graphics card shouldn't need to upgrade
the memory any time soon storage you
won't need to you can add a big
mechanical drive for storing older games
and things on there don't think you can
go to wrong I'm not trying to push
anyone towards building this kind of
system it's just try to give you all the
things to think about and all the
options because waiting may not be the
best thing to do
or it could turn out to be a smart thing
to do if you can wait anyway sort of
rambling on confusing probably you
myself so I'm going to end
I hope you guys enjoyed this little bill
I think it was pretty cool it's good fun
to do something that made sense for once
yeah the last build the last mini ITX
build was a lot of fun but at $2,200 us
it probably wasn't that practical anyway
that is going to do it for this one I
hope you guys enjoyed the video I hope
you enjoyed seeing the live gameplay and
yeah if you are gonna build something
like this let me know and if you're
going to change any of the components
cuz you don't have to build exactly this
I recommend I highly recommend the CPU
and graphics card combo I think that is
really the best bang for your buck but
there's a few different motherboard
options plenty different case options
plenty of storage and memory options so
have to go exactly with what I've given
you it's just a rough guide anyway
like subscribe support us on patreon if
you like I'm your host Steve thanks for
watching and I'll see you again next
time
