unboxed
I'm your host Matt and today we're gonna
be taking a look at as rocks unique g10
gaming router better known for its
gaming motherboards when I Seurat
revealed their foray into the router
market it was quite a surprise to many
of us and the MU M IMO powered g10
gaming router made quite the impression
of Computex mu mio is the latest Wi-Fi
technology that allows for simultaneous
access for mobile devices desktops and
networked appliances to a router or
access point and plenty of devices
equipped with the technology of reaching
the market right now the g10 boasts some
impressive specifications powered by a
Qualcomm dual-core 1.4 gigahertz
processor the 4 by 4 dual band 802 point
11 AC gigabit router claims 800 megabits
per second on its 2.4 gigahertz band and
1733 megabits on the 5 gigahertz band
it's also equipped with 512 megabytes of
DRAM and supports a range of features
which we'll get into a little later what
really sets this router apart is this
little detachable HDMI dongle which sits
on top of the router this dongle can be
removed and plugged into any HDMI port
and use for miracast and airplay and as
it's also a 2 by 2 Wireless end device
it can also be used as a travel router
allowing you to convert an internet
connection into Wi-Fi on the go now
let's take a look at the router itself
as our upstate through the design
concept to that prototype began from a
router or decoration for the living room
or even an art piece for public spaces
therefore they decided to create a
stereoscopic Tower shaped router I mean
it does look pretty cool for a router
however I can't see many people using as
the centerpiece in their home anyway
port wise we've got four Gigabit LAN
ports at the back and of course the
Gigabit LAN port the dongle at the top
has a wormhole of its own 2 for internet
connection sharing as well as a micro
USB port for the 5 volt power source
just beneath the dongle here we have the
infrared transmitter and receiver and
WPS buttons for both the 5 gigahertz
band
and the 2.4 gigahertz band underneath
the Ethernet ports a 2 USB 3 ports where
you can plug in storage devices and
enable easy nasa access via network
below these are just the power switch
and the DC input finally there are eight
high performance antennas none of which
you can see at the role internal so as
you can see the g 10 is eaten a bit in
terms of ports and features using their
easy setup application you can
automatically detect internet
configuration settings which is pretty
standard but also configure your gaming
boost bandwidth settings this allows you
to basically set aside a certain amount
of bandwidth specifically for gaming so
you sister down the hallway I can't hold
all the bandwidth streaming justin
beiber to our iPad while you're trying
to rap dudes in college it could be
pretty handy there's also an ad-hoc
router app that you can install in your
iPhone or Android device using this app
you have the g10 learn the infrared
signals of your various remote controls
and then simply use your smartphone as a
universal remote to control all of your
home appliances this was a little clunky
to set up as you need to teach the
router each remote control function
individually you also need to keep in
mind that it can only really work with
devices in the same room as the router
do the line-of-sight limitations of
infrared one cool thing it does allow
you to do is control your devices from
anywhere in the world for instance if
you teach you to control your split
system you turn on your heater or air
comm when you're leaving work so you can
get home to an already warm or cool
living room as I mentioned earlier you
can connect storage devices through two
USB 3 ports at the back of the router
and these can be set up to stream media
and files via easyness it took a bit of
playing around but once we got it set up
we were able to connect a USB 3 portable
storage device and stream media and
files to any connected and capable
device and you can even set it up as a
personal cloud server for remote access
to your files now let's take a look at
the dongle most gamers and enthusiasts
have probably sorted someway to get
their media streaming to their TV
already but for those that don't and
will benefit from the flexibility and
portability of the dongle it's a really
great feature I know in my house we have
media PCs hooked up already so we
probably never use it but I can
definitely see how it behind
for those that don't in our brief tests
Mira Carson works well and we're able to
stream 1080p content smoothly from a
laptop through Wi-Fi to our living room
using the dongle the internet connection
sharing is the other nifty feature of
the dongle while the dongle itself is
very portable you do also need to have
the way an Ethernet cable available and
plugged in of course and then you also
need to have the micro USB power cord
plugged into the dongle too it's going
to take some foresight and planning
most people will also want to have the
laptop plugged into a power source and
you need to be near enough to wherever
the where needs the net is poking out
once all this is in place you aren't
gonna be feeling very mobile and pretty
much anywhere that's offering you an
internet connection has Wi-Fi already so
I feel like this is going to be a
scarcely used feature for most people
but I could be wrong
so overall the rfgen is a very
impressive unit truly rich in features
that goes above and beyond what you'd
expect from a gaming router the dongle
and USB ports for NAS devices in
particular really set this unit apart
and bridges the gap between router and
entertainment device although they
probably aren't going to satisfy true
power users performance wise the g10
can't be faulted either utilizing the
latest in Wi-Fi technology to deliver
fast speeds and reliable connection for
a premium experience we aren't exactly
sure of the gm's pricing yet at this
stage but it looks like the MSRP is 250
dollars which definitely puts it at the
price around of the spectrum those that
we utilize all of us unique features
will likely present great value but not
so much for those that weren't thanks
for watching another installment of
hardware unboxed I'm your host Matt I'd
love to hear if you'll be considering
upgrading to the G 10 when it's released
