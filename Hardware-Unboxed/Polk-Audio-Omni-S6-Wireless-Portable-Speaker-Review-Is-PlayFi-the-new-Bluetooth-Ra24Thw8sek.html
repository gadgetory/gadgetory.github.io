speaker impulse wireless and multi-room
audio lineup with this type of audio
solution their aims are seamless and
all-encompassing experience not just in
one room but throughout an entire house
well the kind of course functions a
standalone speaker it's really designed
to work hand in hand with other Omni
series units and provide a very partial
internet-of-things type experience how
ready is this technology for the real
world though is it as convenient as it
should be before we delve into the
features of functionality let's take a
quick look at the design and aesthetics
first while somewhat subjective I think
it's fair to say the s6 is a
great-looking speaker it's understated
yet modern looking and as a result I
think it should fit into most decors
quite comfortably you can pick up the s6
in either black or white and I have both
with me here today the unit is wrapped
all the way around with a soft mesh
fabric that's nice to touch and quite
flexible you do need to be careful not
to pick up the unit and stretch or
damages fabric as that would certainly
ruin the look of the hole speaker but
pop thought of this and included a carry
handle at the back of the unit also
found in the back of the unit of the
spaceports and the setup button you find
only the power port USB port and
auxiliary port at the back here there
are any other connectivity options found
on the device the buttons on the front
of the unit of fairly minimal to just
volume up and down and a play/pause
button in between there's an LED
indicator amongst these buttons and
lastly you'll find the Polk Audio logo
up top the bottom of the unit simply
includes two long curved rubber feet to
prevent any unwanted vibrations one
slight oversight I saw in the design was
the power cord position or connector the
back of the unit is flat - supposedly
allow you to place the unit flush
against a wall however the power cord
juts out completely adjacent to this and
eject out quite far an angle connector
certainly would have been a nice touch
in my opinion in terms of hardware the
s6 packs into its sealed box design - 4
inch drivers and two two and
three-quarter inch drivers to deliver
its sound for its size it really packs
some pretty impressive volume as you'd
expect with the speaker configuration
mids and highs are where the unit excels
if you're a bass lover though you might
be left wanting
now that's certainly not to say that the
bass from this unit is poor it's
actually very
tight partly and thanks to the steel box
design but at low levels especially I
thought the low ends are a bit lacking
this is common with this small package
designs however I'm going to do some
serious generalizing now to try and get
a point across I can imagine this
speaker being extremely satisfactory for
people like say my parents who lives
mostly to radio pop music can have long
detested excessive bass am I share
howsoever
when we're pumping a Sat Rocky Rufus or
tame impala we want to feel the house
shake at least a little although our
neighbors would probably appreciate it
if we didn't so if you're that way
inclined as I mentioned you may be left
wanting a little the bass performance
does improve little however as you
increase the volume now let's talk about
connectivity there's definitely some
cons and pros to the way the omnia Suk's
primarily connects to play music through
play fire first let me just gloss over
how this works the omni connects to your
home Wi-Fi network you install the POC
on the app on your smartphone or tablet
and then the app detects the play fire
device simple straightforward perfect in
my opinion far from it let me lead by
saying I would have personally really
like to see the inclusion of Bluetooth
connectivity as an option like many
households in my place the Wi-Fi
coverage is far from perfect
it's a biggish house and every wall is
double brick our routers in the middle
of the house and at the very front and
back
we fees are a little hard to come by as
a result I couldn't take the omni s6
outside on a nice day and pump some
backyard tunes and Northcote my
housemate users in the bedroom at the
front of the house it's a bit of a
bummer I feel like this would pretty
much be a non-issue Bluetooth
connectivity was included as you can
simply switch over to connect by
bluetooth when you're out of your Wi-Fi
range having said all this there is a
three-and-a-half millimeter jack but
come on that's so mm a control router
endlessly if I have to leave my phone
plugged in by the speaker this brings me
to one of the pros of the play file
system we need a beats master on a
Bluetooth device it's very easy to
accidentally leave the room with your
phone in your pocket leave everyone to
be subjected to a stuttering mess of
music because you leave Bluetooth range
as long as it's still within Wi-Fi
you're good with the play filesystem so
that was nice
another limitation I face however was
that my music service isn't supported I
recently migrated to google play music
from Spotify and unfortunately I
couldn't
that music through the Omni s6 is it's
not yet supported a wealth of other
music services are supported whether
most notably including Spotify and title
so as long as you're a premium user
Bluetooth connectivity would have solved
my Google Play Music issue finally
features wires through the
three-and-a-half millimeter jack the
Omni s6 is able to then restream the
input audio to the other Omni speakers
in the house which is pretty cool but
also a feature I pretty much consider
essential considering the kind of
omnipresent system this speaker is
supposed to be creating throughout your
home overall the polk audio omni s6 does
what it's supposed to do very well the
volume and audio quality is good much
better than most smaller package
bluetooth speakers but as mentioned it
may not suit everybody the connectivity
works well but it's quite specific in
some ways you'll definitely need to have
quality Wi-Fi coverage in your home if
you plan on moving the device around
especially finally it looks wise I
personally think it's pretty great the
Omni s6 is not to do everything device
that can take over your entire living
room but for consumers that want to
create a convenient wireless network of
audio throughout the house it may be the
sleep solution that they need thanks for
joining me for another Hardware unbox
