making it possible for Tim and myself to
attend Computex 2019 please check out
their latest AMD x5 70 motherboards made
for gamers and creators by the link in
the video description also thank you to
Corsair for their support please check
all their exciting products out via the
link in the video description welcome
back to hardware box this is part 2 of
the May but sort of in June sort of
Computex special edition QA we are live
here well life for us not life for you
guys it's a recording but we are here in
Taipei it's been being pretty nice but
more importantly there's more of your
questions to get to so let's get into it
alright Jed's asked us a question I
believe about 3rd gen rising related
stuff with the advent of 3rd gen rising
potentially taking the performance crown
will you all consider updating your GPU
test bench to an r9 3900 X assuming it's
the absolute best like AMD is claiming
or would you prefer to keep the 1900 K
test bench so that you don't have to
retest all of the GPUs you've reviewed
for the last year or so well that last
bit somewhat irrelevant because we
usually update all our results every few
months so yeah it doesn't really matter
I'm not too concerned about that will
probably throw out most of our results
in I don't know the next month or so it
really depends it depends on how many
new games we add in things like that but
that's not really a consideration really
the only reason we use the 99er ok or
the 87 or okay but that's the other 99
ok recently it's because the fastest
process of a gaming period it really is
so if the I think if if rise ins even
close to that we would probably still
consider switching over to the Rison
CPUs especially if that's what we're
recommending so ideally I would like to
use the rise in 720 700 X but yeah
you've seen the benchmarks so yeah if it
gets close I think I would still use the
rise in processor anyway just because I
imagine that's what we'll be
recommending and all our builds and what
not going get bored so make much more
sense to test with that and
I think how I address that question I
think the interesting thing will be to
see whether it's the 12 core the 8 core
part that delivers just overall gaming
performance especially when you factor
in like overclocking because I believe
you overclock your 99 yes oh yeah all
overclocked them again that's for the
most part it makes no difference
whatsoever but sometimes it's an EP if
it's a really CPU intensive tile then
you remove the CPU as potentially being
a performance limiting component so yeah
it doesn't I'm not sure if it'll be the
eight of the 12 core probably whichever
overclocks
the best it'll be a frequency thing
they're obviously hate calls right now
for gaming is plenty and 12 just
overkill so but if they're the same I'll
probably go for the overkill option yeah
we tend to do that with the benchmarking
systems it's good to see another Tim
commenting on our videos and asking
questions so other two masks
how will you test the new Navi GPUs will
you test them with a risin 3000 CPU to
take advantage of their PCIe 4.0 support
or will you put them in your 9900 Kay
test bench and run them with PCI 3.0 or
will you test them with both an Intel
system and horizon system okay all the
possibilities there well who knows
basically it depends on timing if
they're released around the same time as
the Rison processes we would continue to
use our updated 1900 k results it
wouldn't really make sense to retest
everything but naturally I would look at
if using Gen 4 PCI Express makes any
difference to performance for the navi
GP so I'm expecting it will make no
difference at all it really won't matter
I doubt that's that card will be
saturating the pcie 3.0 interface but
we'll test it anyway I'm expecting to
find no difference that's really a
future proofing thing that term future
proofing but the boards that do support
a 4th gen PCI Express they'll be pretty
cool products to have flying second hand
in like 5 to however many years because
then the cards then we'll certainly be
saturating the 3rd gen spec expansion
slots
yeah it seems like that spec is more
designed for you storage type stuff
that's running in lots of em got 2 slots
yes and
got two cards I should say yeah yeah and
usually especially if you raid zero
cards and stuff like that initially
that's certainly where you'll be able to
use the bandwidth but for graphics cards
I'm not expecting that to be much of a
game changer so for now okay we have a
comment here from cheeky Keith at WCC F
Tech he said what's in the box so I
think that's a play on words for our
name
however on box I don't know what do you
want about Keith I got that it was one
of the most heavily uploaded comments
everyone's been on this joke except for
us yeah we don't get it so let us know
in the comments all right are you ready
for the next question
doesn't look like Tim is ready for next
question you caught up you ready yeah
yeah good good stuff why does Steve lose
the will to live whenever Tim goes on
about monitors whatever funny that one I
don't know if you're actually joking
with this some people may not have got
the joke and we joked about it once and
maybe they thought I was serious I
didn't like it when Tim talked about
monitors which I do like it when Tim
talks about monitors and I do find it
interesting but I think in 1qa we had a
lot of monitor related questions and I
was sort of sitting back relaxingg
listening and people thought I was
sitting there slowly suffering through
Tim's explanations but no I genuinely do
like Tim's monitor talk that's good well
the the the joke sort of came to be
because yeah because that video I'd
talked about and there was sort of a
behind-the-scenes joke I think with the
patreon members because we went to it
was last year's Computex well it was we
went to one of the parties with the
manufacturers and what the manufacturer
manufacturer that we were talking to
we're getting into monitors so they said
Tim would like to pick your brains what
is it that we have to do right and all
this sort of stuff so then Tim was just
running his mouth for a good hour and
that they were enjoying it they would
take a notes and everything and Tim was
just yeah filling them with information
and I think I was there with Ken from
tech showed and we were sitting back
just laughing at Tim educating them on
monitors it's quite it quite amusing
anyway no I do enjoy
Tim's stuff about one of C's he's very
knowledgeable about them so it's good to
listen to anyway we'll move on actually
here we go monitor question
okay.what jeep are sort of sort of half
a monitor question what GPU and monitor
would you pair with the 3900 x4 4k
gaming well I'll do the GPUs okay go for
it and I'll do the four I'll do the
monitor question a 4k monitor for 4k
gaming I mean really CPUs somewhat
irrelevant you really just want a really
powerful GPU so the r-tx 20 atti right
now is obviously the most preferable
choice otherwise your RX 2080 or it'll
get by with a few tweaks here and there
the same applies to the gtx 1080i and
then of course the Radeon seven graphics
card so that's pretty much a graphics
card you're looking at spending what
$700 + yeah definitely definitely that
high end GPU yeah I mean for the
monitors this kind of sort of your three
directions that you can go in right now
you can get sort of your basic 4k 60
Hertz panel but none of those are super
amazing you know they have limited
freesync range you see the free sync
experience isn't great but I guess one
of the ones I liked from the actually
the show floor was the new MSI model
which I think we're supposed to come in
like 300 to 350 u.s. when it launches in
the next couple months oh that's one to
look out for for that then you've got
your 4k high refresh non HDR there's the
ACE and nitro model I can't remember the
model names they're all possible to
remember that one that's your 4k 144
Hertz
I think those are about $900 so again it
just depends on how much money you have
to spend so that that's really the next
step up for 4k and then you've got your
j sync ultimate monitors you know your a
Sue's PG 27 uqu ASA X 27 the full HD are
there about 1600 or 1700 us at the
moment so it's expensive it's either one
of those tiers so I think if you're a
high roller and you're buying 2080 TI's
then you probably want at least that mid
to your option the $900 one yeah for a
really excellent experience and those
monitors should last for quite a while
with their capabilities so thank God
that Marta talks over
okay with the concern about cooling the
chipset and the beefier VRMs and heat
sinks needed for the 12 and 16
well the unannounced 16 core CPUs do you
think air coolers and better air flow
across motherboards are that they bring
will be superior will be a superior
cooling method for sustained CP
performance particularly for
overclocking on x5 70 okay few things to
address there so I've just nearly
dropped my phone and now I've lost where
that question was I'll continue anyway
so there's a seems like there's a bit of
a misconception with the whole beefy VR
M's and things like that or people are
just making a few assumptions thinking
oh it's got 12 cores now the bit the
VRMs have been beefed up on all X X 570
motherboards these CPUs must be really
power which certainly isn't the case
we've already seen the TDPS have dropped
by about 40%
yeah they've massively so I think what
is that the 3800 X is 40% alone the 2700
X so they're much more efficient the
seven nanometer parts efficiency we're
based on what we're seeing with the TDA
page looks to be very good and the 12
core part is only a 105 what TDP part so
that's 2700 X type TDP so it shouldn't
really be that much more power hungry
than that processor obviously the XF our
precision boost all that stuff comes
into play with better cooling but yeah I
wouldn't be stressing about you your
motherboard or your cooling like if
you're using an older x4 70 ball or
something like that I think people
getting confused because it's kind of on
the Intel CPU front we've just seen them
go from 4 to 6 to 8 yeah and that just
adds power each time because they're
still been on roughly the same process
know with 14 enemies but this is this is
definitely very different with the move
to 7 nanometers the 3700 X is what 65
watts on 8 cores yeah so that's pretty
impressive yeah very very impressive so
obviously upgrading the cooler well we
don't know anything about EXO fire if
it's anything like a Zen Plus you might
see like a hundred megahertz bump but
the coolers we've got available now
we're using will the same will apply so
said yes they're still 65 watt 95 what
105 what part so nothing really change
is there all right another discord
question here we seems to be about
monitors which I'm sure both Steve do
you see the 18 9 aspect ratio becoming a
widespread thing across many more
devices than it already is I'm talking
mid range of low end phones along with
maybe even monitors can't really see it
being too much of a thing for mones
because it's like it's slightly wider
than 16:9 and it's not 21:9 so I don't
think there's much demand for that mid
step between your ultra wide and your
standard 16:9 I can see being used a lot
in phones because that the whole reason
it was introduced for phones because you
know you got this screen you want this
body of a phone and there were parts at
the top and bottom that weren't used so
they just basically extended the screen
into that area and you know it came out
to be around 89 so yeah that would make
a lot of sense but can't see it being
used for monitors too much I wouldn't
have thought this is an interesting
question for those that like sort of
behind the scenes looks at stuff um
whenever you guys shoot a vid is it just
Tim or Steve holding the camera is it
just the two of you or do you have
editing stuff yes first time commenting
just wanted to participate love your
bids Thanks
yeah all of our videos at least I'm
assuming you're talking mostly about our
Computex stuff here he's gonna be I'm
holding the camera Steve's in front of
the video or the other way around we
don't have any editing stuff we didn't
bring editing staff to Computex we don't
have them for our regular coverage it's
just us too so you know if we're making
a video in either of our studios you
know I'm setting up the camera then
walking around and sitting in front of
it and then editing the video so that's
kind of how it goes just a tripod in the
camera right lonely all right next
question is when will AMD announced
third gen ap use so I assume you mean
rise in 3000 series ap use because those
would actually be the second generation
of AP use on the Zen plus architecture I
would imagine it's probably not too far
away but it would be a pretty low-key
long travel thought considering it's not
as into processor on the mobile side we
only saw like a hundred megahertz
upgrades to the clock speed so really
not that much happen there
so yeah Alex
you know the next couple of quarters at
least you know before the end of the
years probably where I'd be expecting
but again very low-key I would imagine
yeah it's a bit confusing with the whole
third gen APU naming but yeah yeah it is
what it is because there was no first
generation ap use basically as what you
know made battle confusing I will jump
to the next one here do you think be 550
chipsets will require active cooling
like the x5 70 chipsets ah what chipset
rather hmm everything about for a moment
I would say yes because they're still
going okay well will they well I see I
would have gone with no and they won't
support PCI you four points well that's
what I was about to say it all depends
on yeah the the PCI Express support
there I heard nothing
so it would be just guesswork it's one
or the other yeah I mean we'd heard that
you know some of the x5 70 motherboards
do cost a fair bit more to make so I
guess that all the additional wiring and
stuff they've done sort of enhance the
piece of sure experience that's right so
I guess based on what we have heard the
answer would be no yes they won't can
you think that cut that first to make
not just the chipset cheaper but also to
make the wiring for the motherboard
cheaper sure to bring the whole board
down and yes price so yeah I probably
goes No yeah yep on reflection yeah I
believe that Tim is correct there yeah I
don't think they will and that would
make sense because it makes the the b5
50 more affordable how the B 550 then
will differ from the be 450 which
doesn't really differ from the be 350
will be a whole different story
yeah basically just affords motherboard
manufacturers the ability to update
their boards and add anything new like
maybe new Wi-Fi stands like that I'd be
interested to see like some of the
better VRMs of control X 570 yeah come
to be 550 but then but then not have
PCIe if you don't need that because then
you get a pretty decent board to support
12 core future 16 core CPUs on a good
platform without necessarily wanting
that feature it does make a lot of sense
really because yeah you don't need most
people don't need gen
for SSDs in their system like your
three-and-a-half gigabytes per second
for sequential read writes is probably
sufficient for most users we know it has
no impact on gaming performance or
anything like that
anyway we worked through that question
and I think we've probably got to a yep
well actually there's a good follow-up
question as some more on PCIe actually
do you think PC a 4.0 and faster drives
can improve CPU performance for example
will it improve Cinebench or blended
scores no well that all depends on stuff
like GPU acceleration I suppose for
blender initially no I would have
thought no it won't make any difference
yeah it's unlikely something GPU PCIe
bandwidth-limited or storage limited I
mean there's storage benchmarks will
improve that's it if you're using yeah
there's not really a workload that sort
of I would think would be impacted too
much yeah your Cinebench scores are
gonna be improved by more cause higher
IPC all that sort of stuff not so much
PCIe 4.0 mm I think it's fair to say on
that one and guess what the next
question is also about PCI 4.0
what would PC a 4.0 do fit gaming at the
moment do you think it could have been
released later and made little to no
difference to most consumers whose it
really benefit with its introduction to
consumer hardware okay well I I think I
can answer this one yep reasonably well
it has no benefit for gaming
they'll be yeah you know have you based
GPUs that use it I'm expecting there'd
be no difference between 3.0 and 4.0 for
the initial release of GPUs I think
it'll be beneficial down the track and
that's so the next question is will it
be beneficial for consumers again we
just said for storage absolutely if you
need ridiculously high speed storage
like yeah crazy fast storage then it
will be beneficial for most people that
won't be it'll just be a thing you have
but it is that future proof thing it is
actually a genuine way of usually future
proofing is just a silly thing but this
is kind of a cool thing because you
won't have to upgrade down the track
you've already got it and we know
looking back at older systems if you buy
and all the Xeon system or something
like they're stuck with sometimes like
PCI Express 2.0 that really does have a
performance so you are better off with a
system with the current specs so yeah
getting it now it just means that these
boards coming out will be pretty cool
items down the track it's not I know
that doesn't benefit the people buying
them now but you're not really buying it
just for that so yeah it's really gonna
benefit those situations when you try
and use multiple high-speed IO devices
simultaneously sure yeah because yeah
you could buy like you know MDOT to
expand the cars or something like that
run multiple drives raid0
yeah we use other functionality in
conjunction with um not to and not have
that be bandwidth limited through a PC a
4.0 that's the main thing
yeah but whether or not that'll be you
know a big deal for you will depend on
what your system is yeah it definitely
allows you to do more yeah it's probably
not gonna benefit everyone but at the
same time it's not yeah it's good to
have yeah exactly
okay another question here from our
patreon discord was making those ITX
builds for your Computex coverage worth
it think pretty clear yes on that one
from me they've been really awesome I'm
having a desktop Verizon 7 2700 X has
been brilliant they've worked flawlessly
Tim and I have rented multiple videos
very quickly
tim has been a little bit let down by
his GP x 1050 graphics card a few GPU
accelerated bugs they're my r9 nano has
been fantastic I actually can't really
tell the difference from my Vega 56 rig
at home in fact it's not actually that
much different from my thread Ripper
Vega Vega 56 unit I mean it's a bit
slower but it's not world's slower like
it's got half as many cores so you
expect quite a reduction there but yeah
the 26 2700 X rather is working really
well yeah I'd agree it's been really
good definitely better than the laptop
solutions that we were bringing last
year so we'll be continuing doing the
mini ITX thing for Computex there the
difficult thing is bringing the monitor
along well we did that last year the
laptop anyway because to do it using at
1080p monitors a nightmare but it's kind
of crazy at one stage Tim and I were
both rendering out a video and then
sitting there and recording audio like
we are now and you had no idea there
were systems in the back
whereas last year just be that
high-pitched screaming noise so that's
good yeah they've been absolutely
fantastic well definitely bringing them
next year no doubt about that hopefully
we'll be ringing them with an x5 70
motherboard with maybe a 12 core part
possibly a 16 core part depending what
happens there oh yeah awesome that
that's the plan for next year for sure
another question here from one of our
patreon members so when you were reading
this we should finally know all the
Rison 3000 stuff thankfully we do at
this point what test do you have in mind
for day one slash soon after day 1
coverage IPC test into chip late--
latency test memory compatibility the
list would no doubt go on yeah for day
one I definitely want to test quite a
few games cuz that's gonna be something
you guys are really gonna want to know
about so I'm hoping to test at least
eight games against a holy verse II for
use at least eight for the day one stuff
and then a usual mix of applications and
then yeah hopefully I can do mixing a
few of those sort of custom tests as if
a bit of a preview and probably all
those things that'd be good
IPC tests yeah we're probably gonna do a
brief IPC test because the 15% thing
everyone's going to want some
confirmation on that into chaplet
latency testing that yeah depending on
how the gaming testing goes we may do
that but these are all definitely stuff
you know tests I want to do memory
compatibility absolutely what we can
actually overclock - there'll be so many
more tests that's not funny they'll be
it's we're gonna couple the are rise and
unbox stuff again because it's just such
an interesting platform and it's sort of
newish so yeah everyone's going to be
excited about it's gonna be loads of
content so if you hate hearing about
rise and then you're not really going to
enjoy our channel over the next two to
three months I'd say next question this
one's about why Tim is so cheap I think
so why is it that Tim prefers to record
video footage at 30fps like a peasant
rather than 60fps like Steve users like
a champion explain that for us to him so
well first up for a long time is because
the camera I've been using can only
record 4k 30fps that's the main
but I do I did buy a Blackmagic pocket
Cinema Camera that can do 4k 60fps but
I'm still not particularly interested in
using it at the 60fps mode I just prefer
the way that 30fps videos look and are
you Steve you prefer the 60fps look so
that's kind of just the reason why we're
doing each of our ways but I know you've
got a little comment here as well about
thanking me for uploading them at true
30fps rather than frame doubling it to
60fps
that was actually an accident I was
going to upload it at 60fps the main
reason for that is that you get more
bandwidth on YouTube you know they allow
you to use a higher bitrate when you
upload a 60fps video so that means that
even if it's frame doubled you should
see better quality from the 60fps upload
and I'm all about making the videos as
high quality as we can possibly deliver
them through YouTube to you so even
though you know rendering and doing
everything at 30fps I'll upload them at
60 just so that you guys can see the
highest possible quality yep he's a
peasant alright last question here yeah
it's a doozy are you two in the same bed
to save money yeah we spoon every night
oh good I love stuff because I know well
we're going through this QA sitting a
new people to be like what are they
