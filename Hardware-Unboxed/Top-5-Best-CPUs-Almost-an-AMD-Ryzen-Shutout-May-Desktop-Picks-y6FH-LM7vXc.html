talking best CPUs best value best
performance best at starting a fight
between a bunch of randoms in the
comment section
you know just the standard stuff this is
a follow-on from the top 5 best desktop
CPUs video that we published back in
June of 2017 and I'll note the pics we
made back then and of course put them
alongside our new pics I've dropped the
best devalue quad-core category is that
no longer really makes sense but for
those of you wondering we did previously
nominate the horizon 5 1400 for that
category
replacing the best devalue quad-core is
the best performance gaming CPU so a new
category that's somewhat at the opposite
end of the spectrum to the category that
it's replacing in addition to the best
performing gaming CPU we also have picks
for the best budget CPU best value
all-round a desktop CPU best value
productivity CPU and well the best
extreme desktop CPUs
first up we have the best budget CPM
previously we went with the intel
pentium g 4560 which I felt was a pretty
obvious option at the time and pretty
much impossible to beat at the time and
this time around though the G 5400
doesn't really offer anything newer 200
megahertz increasing clock frequency
isn't really going to get it over the
line this time although more expensive I
feel the rise in 320 200 G offers
world's more value and apart from being
a true quad-core CPU the integrated Vega
at GPU is just several times more
powerful and for those holding off on
buying a discrete graphics card because
they are quite expensive right now so as
a budget shopper you may want to avoid
that then the 2200 G makes perfect sense
I have to admit though the real
competition for the 2200 G does come
from the core i3 8100 and that
particular processor does cost $20 more
but again without a discrete graphics
card it gets completely smoked by AMD
APU then with the GTX 1060 or an rx 580
for example well I feel both CPUs do
deliver very similar performance we have
shown this in previous benchmark videos
but productivity workloads in general
usage again they are very evenly matched
though once overclocked the 2200 G does
generally come out on top for core heavy
productivity workloads so for me the
fact that the horizon 322 energy is an
unlocked part that can be overclocked on
affordable motherboards can take
advantage of higher clocked memory it
packs a powerful integrated GPU and is
slightly cheap in the core i3 8100 well
all those things for me make it my
number one budget CPM
if you've got around $200 us to spend on
a new CPU then congratulations and if
you want something that can handle any
and all tasks that you can throw at it
with maximum efficiency and I feel the
horizon 520 600 or 2600 X really is a
must
previously we did choose the risin 5
1600 so it makes sense that the our 520
600 series would take over this position
still to avoid triggering any members of
the Blue Man Group
I should just note that the core i5 8400
is a very attractive alternative it's a
little cheaper as well and arguably does
provide better gaming performance in
today's titles but while the 2600 might
not be quite as good for gaming when it
comes to productivity workloads it's
really in a different league it's fair
to say that the superior multi-threaded
performance offsets these slightly
wicked gaming performance of course when
it comes to gaming I am generalizing
here there are situations in games where
the horizon processor does come out on
top the twenty six hundred and twenty
six hundred or so unlocked CPUs and
therefore can be overclocked on
inexpensive be 350 motherboards I also
really like the fact that AMD has
announced that these CPUs and the
platform will be supported until at
least 2020 so that's certainly something
worth considering when investing your
money
for three hundred to three hundred and
thirty dollars u.s. the Rison 720 700
series can't be beat when it comes to
practice at least overall the core i7
8700 series still holds an advantage for
lightly threaded workloads thanks to a
clock speed advantage but for seriously
taxing and time-consuming workloads the
twenty-seven hundred and twenty seven
hundred ex often noteworthy performance
gains the second generation CPUs also
made a decent step forwards when it
comes to gaming performance and here the
2700 X is very respectable especially
when paired with the right memory there
is applications and I suppose games
continue to make better use of Verizon
sevens many cause applications such as
Premiere Pro CC for example then we will
continue to see it rise and walk away
with it because of this and AMD's
continuing commitment to the a m4
platform I feel like right now these
second gen rising series offers shoppers
the most bang for their buck in the $300
u.s. price range
all right so you've got yourself a gtx
1080i or perhaps you've taken out a
mortgage and got yourself a titan and
you're after the very best gaming cpu
the market has to offer no compromise
solution that just spits out as many
frames as your graphics card can under
whatever conditions your gaming well i
there's few that can really argue that
the core i7 87 who isn't that cpu intel
has a low latency ring bus architecture
has proven to be the best solution for
gaming and couple that with a cpu that
can comfortably clock all calls at 4.7
gigahertz and you can do that with a
click of a button by enabling MC if it's
not enabled by default and well with a
bit of manual overclocking most should
hit at least 5 gigahertz on all caused
so add that those two factors you have
the low latency and the high frequency
and well you got yourself a winner
I should just quickly note though not
trying to spoil the core i7 87 oh ok
party here but there is a rumor the
Intel might ditch support for the 8th
gen series sooner than expected and that
could be a bit of a problem and while
that would be a real real shame if true
let's be honest you might die of old age
before a 5 gigahertz 6 chord 12 thread
CPU is noticeably slower in games than
whatever the future might hold in any
case if money's no object and you simply
want the best of the best for gaming and
the core i7 87 hurricane's it hands down
you can't argue with facts
okay so last time out they picked the
core i9 7900 X and had the following to
say the core I nine seven 100 X is
incredibly expensive
it does run very hot and when
overclocked it is very power hungry it
doesn't come with a cooler and the x2
nylon platform is very expensive however
it's also blistering faster with a
custom liquid cooled solution the
overclocked performance is incredible
automatically I don't recommend buying
the 700 X until Amy's thread ripper
arrives and we've had a chance to
reevaluate still if you must buy now in
your where a competitor isn't coming
then sure get the 700 X it's still a
beast so as you no doubt well aware that
competitor did arrive and last year boy
did it land hard the thread rippin
nineteen fifty X in 1920 X ripped to the
sky like X line up a new one and today
the nineteen fifty X makes a mockery of
Intel 79 80 XE 79 60x 7940 x79 20x and
70 900 X at least it does in my opinion
although the 16 quart 32 thread core i7
79 60 X is at times faster it also costs
100% more 100 percent more for roughly
the same performance and we're not
talking about small numbers here even
last year's best extreme desktop CPU
picker semi her ex still cost slightly
more at $920 us and well the 1950 ex
just completely wipes the floor with it
this really was the easiest pick of the
bunch for me to make and it seems like
the majority of shoppers also agree with
me it also doesn't hurt that I replaced
my core i7 at 69 50 X with the thread
Ripper nineteen fifty X and I've been
extremely pleased with the results for
video editing and gaming anyway right
now the thread Ripper 1950 X occupiers
23rd position on Amazon's best CPU
stylist and that is an incredible result
for a $900 CPU in fact it costs more
than twice as much as every CPU that
appears before it on the list then the
79 RX that comes in at 36th position on
the grid and then the 79 60 X is 99th so
it just made it into the top 100 list
any higher on the list and well you
wouldn't amount to find it well there
you have it my CPU Peaks as of May
2018 The Horizon 320 200 G is a solid
choice for budget shoppers and the
upcoming second generation arisin 3 CPS
probably won't change that too much but
of course we'll have to wait and see the
rise in five twenty six hundred and
twenty six hundred x were in my opinion
the obvious choice as the best value
desktop CPUs likewise the horizon 720
720 700 X make the most sense for those
wanting to get some real work done then
for the ultimate no compromise gaming
experience well there's really nothing
better than the core i7 8700 K it's a
cracker of a CPU that one then for those
after an extreme desktop CPU I did drop
the core I 970 hundred X in favor of the
risin thread grip at 1950 X and I feel
spending well over $1000 u.s. to get a
sky like equivalent just is madness at
this point finally don't forget while
you're battling over your best CPU picks
in an effort to defend the honor of your
clan let me know what your top 5 worst
CPU list currently looks like personally
I don't think there are any truly bad
CPUs that have been released so far this
year but maybe I've missed something and
if I have I'm sure you guys will let me
know about it in the comment section
below anyway that is gonna do it for
this one I'm your host Steve and I'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
