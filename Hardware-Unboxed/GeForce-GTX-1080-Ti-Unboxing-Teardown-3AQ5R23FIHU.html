just a quick little video here and no
there aren't any benchmarks I just want
to take a moment to show off something
that should rather impress you just need
to adjust the frame a little bit lower
low and that's it meeting videos new
GeForce GTX 1080 Ti well here's the box
anyway perhaps we should take a look at
what's in side what do you reckon and
there we go
well the card itself looks very much
like the GTX 1080 and 1070 and I really
love the look of these founders Edition
cards of course we now have the little
TI or ty how you want to pronounce it
tacked on to the end of the GTX tonighti
label which looks a bit special because
the 1080 TI is based on the same GP one
own to die as the Titan X we do find an
8 pin as well as a 6 pin PCI power
connector other than that though out of
the box the cards look very much the
same of course under the hood or that
big sexy cooler is a full 3584 kuduk or
enabled GP 102 GPU made up of an
incredible 12 billion transistors there
are also 224 text units though the ROPS
have been reduced by 8% from 96 to a
rather odd 88 this is the 12 gigabyte
memory buffer of the Titan X reduced to
11 gigabytes again another odd number
here once again gddr5 X memory is being
used and it operates at an incredible
frequency of two thousand seven hundred
and fifty megahertz Nvidia says that
they have been working closely with
micron to improve the signal noise and
jitter of their high-speed gddr5 X
memory the improvements of aladdhin
video to hit eleven gigabits per second
on the memory which is faster than the
ten gigabits per second memory speed of
the Titan X and GT x 1080 the Pitt
compute throughput of the GTX 1080i is
also slightly higher than the Titan X
due to the T is higher boost clock and
memory bandwidth
although the ti model features a
narrower 352 bit wide memory bus the
higher clock gddr5 X memory is able to
compensate the end result is an
impressive memory bandwidth of 484
gigabytes per second that's not far off
the
performance a first-generation HBM
officially in video claims that the GTX
Ti will be roughly 20 to 40 percent
faster than the vanilla 1080 given the
specs that certainly sounds right since
I can't show you any performance figures
yet let's pull this thing apart
admittedly this probably isn't the
smartest move as I risk damage to the
card if I'm not careful and since I'm
yet to run any benchmarks that would be
disastrous so let's be extra careful
Nvidia says the GTX 1080i features
improved cooling performance that will
provide lower temperatures while making
less noise so that is a win-win for
those wondering and I'm sure there's
many of you the UT I model aways 1041
grams while the original 1080 tips the
scales at 1029 grams some pretty crazy
stats you might not get elsewhere
that's the hardware unboxed difference
right there as I understand it only
found as edition models will be
available upon release while the custom
board partner cards should follow a week
or two later the good news though for
early adopters this time is that NVIDIA
has dropped their ridiculous founders
edition tax this reference model will
come in at the starting price of $700
u.s.
that's an incredible 42 percent saving
over the Titan X which will remain at
$1200 u.s. what's more is in a very
unexpected move Nvidia has competed with
their own product line here as a result
reduced the GTX 1080s MSRP by a whopping
$100 taking the much-loved 1080 down to
just $500 that's pretty incredible news
and that 16% saving has already been
passed on to consumers prior to the 1080
TI's release well that's about it for
this one I hope you guys enjoyed
unboxing the gtx 980ti and stripping it
down to flaunt its bear components
expect to see a complete review later
this week I will be testing I believe
it's 20 games at 1440p and 4k and
comparing the 1080 Ti against all the
relevant competition I'm your host Steve
I hope to catch you guys again soon
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
