checking out how the thread Ripper 1900
X should perform for those of you
unaware AMD did announce just before the
thread Ripper launch that there would be
a $550 US 8 core 16 thread model for the
X 399 platform so in other words
inexpensive Rison 7 cpu that supports
quad channel memory and a boatload of
PCI Express Lanes it's an interesting
option and unfortunately we don't yet
know how it will perform I am hoping
that I will be able to purchase one next
week
AMD aren't sampling the 1900 X so I will
have to buy one it's always a bit of a
worry when companies don't sample
products they probably haven't got much
faith in the 1900s being a hit I do
realize that I am quite late to the
party with the simulated benchmarks as
you can now order the real deal but I
run these benchmarks a few weeks ago and
I had played me at the mounts sooner but
here we are unfortunately it got pretty
busy around these parts with vaguer and
a few other things so yeah the simulated
benchmark got put on the back burner
anyway I thought it can't hurt to show
you guys the results I have and we can
look at the real deal next week for
those wondering the 1900 X is basically
the same physical chip as the 1920 X in
1950 X obviously with less cause enabled
however where is the bigger core count
parts packed a whopping 32 megabyte
level 3 cache the 1900 X only gets a 16
megabyte level 3 cache and that's
something I can't simulate that's the
same size cache as what you'll find on a
Rison 7 or some of the Rison 5 CPUs so
keep that in mind that that is something
that we cannot simulate by using a 1950
X and disabling half of everything
speaking of which when compared to the
1950 X you do get half as many caused
threads and level 3 cache with the real
1900 X and again we're simulating half
as many caused threads but not the level
3 cache so given that I have taken the
1950 X and disabled half the cores on
the msi x3 9 I'm gaming Pro carbon AC
this should give us a really good idea
of how the 1900 X will perform
due to the increase in base clock
frequency the real 1900 X could be
slightly faster than what's shown in
this video though the same turbo clock
speed of four gigahertz does apply so I
expect the results to be pretty spot-on
in any case it will give us a good idea
of what to expect from the 1900 X I've
got a few benchmarks lined up so let's
check them out first up let's just get
this one out of the way I'm only running
a single gaming benchmark for the
simulated test thread rippers not really
about the gaming but it's certainly
capable anyway once I have the real deal
I'll run considerably more tests running
the local and distributed memory modes
please note these results are based on
the default memory mode which uses the
distributed profile and this enables uma
or unified memory access be aware this
isn't the best option for gaming
performance and this is why the 1,900 X
does Trail the 1800 Xu anyway we can see
that the 1900s roughly matches the 1920
X and our 7 1700 moreover with a minimum
of 151 FPS it's obviously still very
capable at higher resolutions you'll
really see no difference between the
1900 X and se the core I 979 hundreds as
we will be running into GPU bound
scenarios here here we find that even
with 8 cores the 1900 X is still able to
deliver big memory bandwidth
thanks to the quad channel memory
controller a throughput of 61 gigabytes
per second is nothing to sneeze at but
how much of an advantage does this give
the 1900 X over the 1,800 X in the real
world well let's go find out first that
we have Excel 2016 and this test doesn't
really take advantage of faster memory
so it's not that surprising that we see
the 1900 X is really only able to match
the 1,800 X moving right along to ham
break this is a test that can take
advantage of that extra memory bandwidth
and as a result we do see the 1900 X
offering 15% better performance than the
1800 X that's a decent game right there
it was also 28% slow in the 1950 X so
again that's a pretty good result for
the 1900 X this time we're testing with
blender we see a nice 17% reduction in
the render time for the 1900 X over the
1,800 X and this place it's just 5%
behind the core i7 78 20x and that's not
bad given it will cost around 8% less
moving on to the povery testing we see
that the 1900 X is able to complete the
workload
around 9% fast in the 1800 X so another
strong gain can be seen here finally we
have Premiere Pro CC and here we will
see a small 3% reduction in the export
time which isn't bad but it's certainly
not the best result we've seen wrapping
up the graphs we do have the power
consumption numbers and in general the X
3 9 and I'm platform will consume more
power than the X 3 70 so for this reason
you can expect the 1970 X to guzzle more
than the 1,800 X still keep in mind
though that simulated power consumption
figures are always a little bit sketchy
but I believe we will be seeing similar
numbers to these with the 1900 X using
around 10% more for the entire system
drawer which obviously isn't that bad
given how substantial the platform
upgrade is well there you have it these
simulated benchmarks they're pretty much
was expecting to find in the memory
sensitive applications namely those
rendering and encoding workloads we see
at the 3 Ripper 1900 X does offer
noteworthy gains over the horizon 7 1800
X in applications and games though that
don't take advantage of the increased
bandwidth you can pretty much expect a
rise in 7 like performance the thread
Ripper 1900 X is an interesting animal
at 550 dollars it costs 20 percent more
than the 1800 X but over 80 percent more
than the 1700 taking just the chip cost
into consideration the 1900 X in my
opinion is worth the premium over the
1800 X every day of the week but having
said that you really shouldn't be buying
the 1800 X to begin with and over 80%
more costly than the r7 1700 well that's
a tough one
at least when trying to justify a case
for purchasing in the 1900 X also keep
in mind the cheapest X 399 board's cost
over $300 u.s. and the very awesome MSI
X 399 gaming Pro carbon a/c is one of
the most competitively priced external
iron boards available right now and at
350 dollars u.s. it's still three times
the price of an entry-level X 370 board
so if you are just after an eight-course
16 thread CPU for proactivity workloads
or content creation or whatnot then the
horizon 7 1700 and a decent X 370
motherboard will only set you back
around $450 at most meanwhile an X 399
motherboard with the 1900 X will cost
twice that figure at around $900 u.s.
so paying a hundred percent more for
maybe a 15% increase in performance
doesn't really sound that great
the only other advantage here is of
course those extra PCIe lanes and
generally speaking x3 nan and I
motherboards tend to be a little more
feature-rich even so if I was in need of
way more PCIe lanes and what rice and
seven has to offer I'm not sure I could
justify spending twice as much to get
them I think for the extra investment
I'd also want more CPU resources as well
so more cores and threads and for me
this is why the 1920 X and 1950 X just
makes so much more sense
still if a course has you more than
covered it's really just those extra
PCIe lanes that you need then in that
rare scenario the 1900 X probably would
make sense anyway that's all I'm gonna
cover for now this was just a brief look
at the simulated benchmarks and we'll
obviously wait till I have the real 1900
X in hand before we get or in depth and
throw tons of benchmarks at you but I
will also be doing another thread Ripper
video really soon at least I hope I will
be because I will be updating my editing
rig as I promised I want to go to the
1950 X and with that I will be using the
MSI X 399 gaming Pro carbon ac so keep
an eye out for that
oh and just lastly if you have an old PC
in need of a few upgrades or perhaps you
know a friend or family member there in
need of upgrading their PC then check
out our newly announced upgrade my PC
plea series we're offering viewers the
chance to win a $500 us upgrade package
tailored to their system that's an
exciting new series so check out the
announcement video I'll include the link
below I'm your host Steve see you again
soon guys
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
