not going to address one of the frequent
comments we've seen across our videos on
the ITX 20 80 and 90 X 20 80 TI so far
has already no we said now reviews of
those cards that the RT X 28 years
particularly poor value right now as it
offers you know GT X 1080 TI like
performance at a higher price making it
pretty useless while the RT X 20 80 TI
it is the fastest card on the market but
it's even worse value thanks to more
than 80% price premium over the 20 80 TI
for only around 30% more performance on
average the question or even just
blanket statement we keep seeing pop up
relates to DL SS we keep seeing comments
like it's worth buying the ITX 2084 DL
SS or DL SS is the killer feature for
these RT x cards well today we're doing
an early investigation into DL SS to see
whether it actually could be the reason
to buy an RT X 2080 or RT X xx atti
using the current DL SS demos we have
available I'm gonna comment a bit more
on this after the quality demonstrations
but we weren't originally going to cover
DL SS so soon because there are only two
in video provided demos right now that
allow us to use DL SS in action neither
of them are actual games instead there
can benchmark so it's not really the
best way to explore and analyze DL SS
but we are seeing a lot of talk about
the text so I think it warrants an early
investigation anyway so if you're not
familiar with DL SS it stands for deep
learning super sampling and it's a new
rendering technology that only works
with NVIDIA GeForce r-tx graphics cards
there are two dl SS modes but we can
only test one of them right now the
standard ELSS mode so it's the one we'll
be focusing on while the name does have
super sampling in it the standard DL SS
mode isn't really super sampling it's
more an image reconstruction technique
that renders a game at a sub native
resolution then uses inferencing to
upscale and improve the image and of
course the AI processing element of DL
SS is only possible thanks to Turing's
tensor course so what DL SS aims to
provide is a 4k image equivalent to a
native
okay presentation except with higher
performance than you otherwise get
through native rendering this is
possible because at 4k DLS s is actually
rendering the game at approximately
1440p so with two times fewer samples
and then upscaling it using an AI
network trained on a sixty-four times
super sample anti-aliased reference
image you could think of it as an
advanced upscaling technology similar to
checkerboard rendering or temporal
rendering techniques game consoles like
the ps4 pro used to render games at 4k
while actually rendering them at lower
resolutions theoretically DLS s fixes
one of the issues with checkerboard
rendering making it more suitable for PC
gaming where the artifacts generator
through checkerboarding are much more
noticeable anyway let's get into some
actual quality comparisons and we'll
start with the Final Fantasy 15
benchmark I recommend watching this
video at youtube's maximum 4k quality or
alternatively downloading the source
quality file from our patreon page if
you are a picture member first up we
have a direct comparison of native 4k
with temporal anti-aliasing or taa up
against DL SS at 4k it's an interesting
comparison to make because in some
situations DSS provides superior image
quality to the native 4k taa
presentation such as with distant trees
in some motion shots however for the
most part the 4k tiene image is better
giving you improved fine detail and a
lot of the various scenes particularly
the car at the beginning of the
benchmark run the grass a bit later on
and the close-up food shot towards the
end the differences in quality range
anywhere from very hard to spot to quite
noticeable on a 4k display it's into the
DL SS struggles with a lot of fine high
resolution texture work that the native
image provides especially in more static
shots
however as DL SS doesn't have a temporal
component this reconstruction technique
finds it easy to clean up moving shots
where ta a either blurs the image or
introduce artifacts which is why in some
aspects it is superior
DLS says at least in this benchmark is
pretty close to the native 4k
presentation but it's definitely not the
same as native 4k and those with higher
resolution displays will be missing out
on the extra detail you get with a true
native presentation
of course steel SS vs. 4k taa is the
stock standard comparison Nvidia
suggests so I decided to look at a few
other comparisons starting with deal SS
versus a 4k image with no anti-aliasing
of course right away you'll spot a ton
of missing artifacts on the 4k no an
image which is to be expected and I
wouldn't suggest people play with a a
disabled is especially bad on you know
the characters hair and grass but the no
AAA image does produce noticeably
sharper and clearer texture quality when
you look at say the middle of an object
where there are few jaggies or artifacts
distant tree quality as well has now
improved to the point where the know AAA
presentation is equivalent to DLS s
rather than inferior to deal SS and this
begins to highlight one of the key
issues with Final Fantasy 15
anti-aliasing techniques then rubbish
the tha implementation in this game is
terrible its most comparable to a blur
filter rather than a decent AAA
implementation that preserves fine
detail while smoothing out edges and
removing shimmering enabling ta in the
game simply wipes out a lot of the fine
texture detail you'd otherwise get at 4k
and completely destroys scenes during
motion I'm not the biggest fan of taa in
most games but it is possible to get
right shadow of the Tomb Raider for
example is a game with decent TAA this
softens edges with that significantly
reducing texture quality but in this
particular game ta a well it sucks to be
honest because Final Fantasy 15 sta is
so bad the game isn't a great comparison
between the native 4k image and Els s a
lot of games use far better
anti-aliasing techniques either with
better taa or techniques like SM AAA or
a combination of both so it's all well
and good to say DL SS looks pretty close
to Final Fantasy 15 s native 4k t a
presentation but how well will it
compare to a majority of games with
better anti-aliasing and better native
4k well it's hard to say for certain but
I'd certainly expect the gap in image
quality to widen that's not to say DSS
is going to be a bust there's certainly
a place for a rendering technique that
provides better performance for a small
reduction in image quality after all we
already have quality settings for a
whole range of other effects but I don't
think the Final Fantasy 15 demo is great
for judging that exact quality reduction
most games there is one very nice thing
to highlight for KD LSS is far superior
to a native 1440p presentation as you
might recall DL s s is upscaling from
1440p to try and imitate 4k were a
native 1440p textures in fine detail are
noticeably blurrier when upscaling that
image to 4k ourselves whereas using DL
SS for upscaling it's kind of like a
magic filter that cleans up everything
even applying a sharpening filter using
Ray shade to try and I guess cheat a bit
and clean up the blurry 1440p taa image
it's still not as clean as the DL SS
image though it is better than the
regular non sharpened 1440p presentation
in terms of performance well DL SS isn't
a free anti aliasing or upscaling
technique so you're not going to get
1440p class performance while getting a
near 4k presentation for our benchmark
runs of Final Fantasy 15 s benchmark DL
SS improved performance by 34% looking
at average frame rates and 27% looking
at 1% lows however that is compared to a
native 4k running at a native 1440p
improved things again producing a 26%
higher average frame rate compared to 4k
d LSS and I think that's a reasonable
reflection of how the visual quality
stacks up DL SS is a middle ground
between native 1440p and 19 for K though
DL SS is closer to 4k in terms of
quality so of these three options I
think it it could deliver the best
bounce between performance and visuals
for those that are less likely to notice
the quality reduction compared to native
4k DSS could be the way to go but again
this is only looking from one game and
we have to wait for actual playable
games to see how it stacks up in a more
real-world usage scenario the other demo
perhaps the more interesting of the two
demos we can currently test Dale SS in
is epics infiltrator it's pretty similar
story when comparing DSS to 4k ta yeah
except in this demo the TA
implementation isn't complete garbage
DLS s does clean up a few of the
temporal artifacts that ta introduces
however the 4k taa image is sharper and
clearer throughout the run and it's
particularly noticeable during the
slower panning sections it's not a bad
effort from DLS s considering it's
working with a 1440p source it does get
pretty close to native 4
okay and in a lot of scenes I found it
pretty hard to spot any differences
however native 4k is that little bit
sharper so I wouldn't call the two
images completely comparable again
comparing 1440p to 4k d LS s don't show
d LS s to be quite a bit better in terms
of its clarity and overall visual
quality so DL SS is once again working
some black magic to upscale the image
significantly above the source of 1440p
material however this is perhaps the
most interesting comparison in this
video the infiltrator demo allows you to
mess around with the resolutions a bit
more than Final Fantasy 15 so here I
have a native 1800 P image upscale to 4k
next to 4k Dell SS this is a serious
battle in some situations I noticed
fewer jagged edges with the upscaled
1800 P image and in some situations I
noticed higher detail with the DAO SS
imagery it's an incredibly close
comparison where native 4k was that
little bit sharper than dl SS 1800 P is
a very good match for deal s s and
here's the fun part
native 1800 P rendering delivers nearly
identical performance to deal s s in the
infiltrator demo DL SS is about two
percent faster in average frame rates
and six percent faster in one percent
Louis of course DL SS is a good 37
percent faster than 4k in average frame
rates but the key thing here is DL SS is
nearly identical visually to 1800 P
while also providing near identical
performance just before I jump into the
conclusion I wanted to briefly touch on
TLS s at 1440p which is the lowest
supported resolution for DLS s he D LS s
is sampling the game at 1080 P then
upscaling and I think a lot of what I
said about 4k d LS s versus 4k TAA holds
up here as well if anything the
difference in clarity is a bit more
pronounced at this resolution in favor
of native 1440p I believe the demo is
also CPU limited here with the 20 80 TI
and an overclocked 8700 K so there's not
much point talking about performance so
there's a few interesting takeaways here
from this early look at deal SS but
let's first start with the limitations
we only have two demos to go on neither
of which are games we can jump in and
freely play instead they are fully
canned on the rails benchmarks and it
would be easier for nvidia to optimize
their our network used with de LSS for
these canned scenarios rather than for a
dynamic game so what we're seeing key
could be DL SS image quality that is
better than in real world games it's
also a pretty small sample size Final
Fantasy 15 is a particularly poor
comparison because its stock standard
anti-aliasing taa in this case is a
rubbish implementation of that
technology which blurs the otherwise
sharp clear imagery you normally get
with native 4k and while infiltrator
isn't as limited in that regard it's not
an actual game Nvidia also provided
these benchmarks in a way that makes it
very difficult to test anything other
than the resolutions and quality
settings they want us to use both demos
are launched using batch files with
pretty much everything locked down which
is why you might have only seen DL SS
versus 4k ta comparisons up to this
point I'd have loved to pick DL SS up
against better anti-aliasing techniques
but it just wasn't possible on face
value you look at the 4k taa versus DSS
comparisons and it's hard not to be
impressed
Dell SS does provide pretty similar
visual quality to native 4k it's not
quite as good but it's close all while
giving you around 30 to 35% more
performance and compared to native 1440p
which the OSS uses for its AR enhanced
image reconstruction this form of ups
going looks like black magic but dig a
little deeper and at least using the
infiltrator demo DL SS is pretty similar
in terms of both visual quality and
performance to running the game at 1,800
P and then ups going the image to 4k
again it's just one demo and not a real
game but poring over the footage and
performance data really tempered my
expectations for what to expect when DL
SS comes to real-world games after all
anyone with an older GPU say a Pascal
based 1080 T I could simply run games at
1,800 P and get similar performance and
visual quality to DLS s on an RT X 2080
that is if real-world in-game
implementations of DL SS are similar to
what we saw in info trailer this is
partly why I didn't want to explore DSS
fully until we had more tools at our
disposal we still don't know how DL SS
compares to different anti-aliasing
techniques or whether running at
something like 1800 P with a super low
cost form of ante
using would deliver better result for
DSS without proper integration in real
world games it's simply too early to say
for sure but going what I've seen so far
I don't think DSS is as revolutionary or
as important as Nvidia and making out so
as it stands right now with zero
real-world games to use with DL SS I
have to say I haven't seen anything to
suggest DL SS is a good reason to
upgrade to an RT X graphics card or that
the performance uplift from DSS
justifies the crazy high prices for RTX
cards and the list of games that will
support DSS isn't exactly filled with
all the hottest upcoming titles either
there are some big games in there but
there will be plenty as well that don't
support DL SS we will be revisiting DL
SS when we can play some actual games
that integrate it don't know when that
will be but hopefully soon enough
otherwise that just about does it for
this early investigation into DL SS
