installment in this series things in
video needs to fix previously we
discussed things that Tim and myself
felt AMD and Intel needed to address now
it's time to focus on the Green Team
since we do have quite a bit to talk
about here I won't give you a whole
rundown on the previous two episodes if
you're interested in those and you did
miss them then the links will be
available below as with the previous
videos we're looking at this from your
perspective the perspective of a
consumer so let's get into it
after the gtx970 fiasco we thought in
the video would want to play it cool
with the geforce 10 series but I guess
with it being one of the best-selling
GPUs of all time they clearly didn't see
the need and video started off strong in
May of 2016 with the gtx 1080
followed up by the 1070 in june and then
in July the 1060 it was a strong lineup
covering the 250 dollar 400 and $600
u.s. price points that in late 2016 and
video throw us a curveball with the 3
gigabyte 1060 a new model featuring half
as much of VRAM which in itself wasn't a
particularly big deal however what was a
big deal was the fact that they disabled
an SM unit taking the kuda coil count
from 1280 down to eleven hundred and
fifty-two this meant despite having the
exact same name it actually featured 10
percent fewer cause calling a three
gigabyte model a gtx 1060 was extremely
misleading given that the specs only
suggest that the vm capacity had been
changed and not the core count
ideally in video really should have
called that model of gtx 1050 TI before
the 1050 TI it was launched in october
admittedly though this isn't something i
pulled in video up hard enough on at the
time i've since called them out a few
times about it but i regret not making
more noise about this you know day 1
coverage it seems in video didn't really
care about the negative feedback they
received from some reviewers and many
customers as they went on to later
release a five-year bite 1060 and
although that model does have all the
cores enabled the reduce
memory capacity in this case also means
less memory bandwidth and therefore less
performance then more recently they also
released a three gigabyte version of the
GTX 1050 which has less bandwidth than
the original two and four gigabyte
models so we want to see in video do
better here moving forward and just stop
with the misleading product names and we
personally will make much more of an
effort to push back against this and to
consumer practice now if you thought we
missed the whole GT 1030 fiasco
when discussing the misleading product
names well we didn't it's just that this
one is so bad that we felt it deserved
its own category the three gigabyte
version of the GTX 1060 certainly was
misleading and should have never
happened
but for around 20% less than the 60
gigabyte version those playing at 1080p
I should only see about a 7% dip in
performance so at least in terms of
value it is actually pretty good again
we're not trying to justify anything by
saying that we're merely noting that
it's not actually a bad value product
however what NVIDIA has recently pulled
with the GT 1030 really is disgusting
there's just there's no other way to put
it
although the core configuration hasn't
been touched as was the case with the
GTX 10 63 gigabyte the performance has
been severely crippled by swapping out
the gddr5 memory with ddr4 memory the
stuff that modern desktop PCs use as
system memory the end result is almost
three times less memory bandwidth
dropping down from an already anemic 48
gigabytes per second to just sixteen
point eight gigabytes per second this
means that in memory intensive workloads
in other words games the new ddr4
version is often one to two times slower
and it's not half the price either it's
like $10 cheaper just $10
this is incredibly deceitful by Nvidia
and the ristic game is on a tight budget
is extreme and while it's unfair to take
advantage of anyone robbing those
struggling the most to get into game
really is disgusting in our opinion I
could go on and on about this one but
for now let's just move on as there are
a few more things we need to discuss
with the release of the GeForce ten
series
Nvidia announced the founders edition a
sexy-looking reference card that no one
should have bought and we said so or we
said as much in our day one coverage in
terms of quality the founders Edition
models aren't bad thermals leave a
little bit to be desired but overall the
build quality is good and they look
quite nice
personally I don't actually have too
much of an issue with the FE cards that
many of you have asked me to include
this one in the video so I have and I
can certainly understand where you're
coming from Nvidia do charge a premium
for the inferior references on graphics
cards and let's be honest that the FE
models are just reference design cards
and the real problem is that they often
make them the only choice for early
adopters and they do this for the first
few weeks which in my opinion is Nvidia
yet again taking advantage of their most
loyal customers that said I should just
quickly point out that you do have the
option to wait and get a board partner
cut at a cheaper price and a board
partner card offers better thermals and
all that sort of stuff and this is what
we recommended you do in our day 1 GT X
1080 review unfortunately though if you
are after a Titan model then you will be
forced to buy a reference card from
Nvidia so on that note it would be good
to see and video open up the Titan
series to their blog partners to make
custom-designed versions of that card
but probably more important than that we
would just like to see that the board
partner cards are included in all the
day1 launches as I said this one isn't
too much of an issue for us but we would
like to see Nvidia allow their partners
to offer custom design cards on launch
day much like what they did with the GTX
1072 I released for example
speaking of the GTX 1072 I we would like
in video to stop feeding us new GPUs I
mean sure release a new generation over
the course of a few months if you must
but after that just stuff it with the
unnecessary cut down models that share
the same names as the fully fledged
parts stop it with GPUs that we don't
need that just clutter up the product
line and stop rolling your most loyal
customers in the process we've already
talked about the dodgy cut-down model so
there's no need to go over all that
again and as for releasing models we
don't really need late in a park cycle
such as the gtx 1070 TI it's not
terrible but it can confuse people the
big issue with releasing so many
products within the same series is in a
video always ends up tripping over
themselves and in the process they just
burn their most loyal gaming customers
if you bought a Titan X for example in
late 2016 you'll probably feeling pretty
good about yourself 40% more CUDA cores
than the flagship g4s part just made it
a complete another beast of course
you're also paying twice the price that
made absolutely no sense in terms of
cost per frame but still it was the
undisputed king seven months later
though Nvidia will like I hope you
enjoyed those bragging rights because
we're offering basically the same
product for $500 us less then a month
after that they were like are you upset
about the gtx 1080i yet no still in july
huh well how about a Titan X little P
the P is for taking the piece addition
we're adding 7% more criticals and we're
going back to charging $1200 us how
about that oh and if you're a star Wars
fan it might have paid to wait a further
six months flea Titan X P collector's
edition it's not easy being an Nvidia
fan with deep pockets
seriously though that's some pretty
amazing high-end early adopter abuse
right there
this one is a bit tricky to tackle
because NVIDIA can and will only charge
as much as they can so if you're going
to pay $1,000 u.s. for a graphics card
they're going to charge you that much
and it's kind of hard to pull them up on
it and we also have to contend with
cryptocurrency mining and we've seen how
that can just below the demand for GPUs
to the point blow up the demand for GPUs
to the point where just a million videos
MSRP mean nothing at all back in 2010 in
video a charging just $500 u.s. for
their flagship part the GeForce GTX 480
they did the same with the GTX 580 but
later released the $700 GTX 590 and it
was at that point that they probably
realized that they could charge gamers
much more for high-end graphics cards by
the time the GTX 670 thousand 12 they
were well aware of that fact and we've
got the GTX 690 for $1,000 u.s. it made
no sense whatsoever
but for that price they still sold so
with confirmation that a video could
sell $1,000 us graphics cards to gamers
that made no sense in 2013 the Titan
range was born and this helped them to
justify a $700 u.s. asking price for the
flagship GeForce part you probably say
that the Titan Z was somewhat of an
experiment to see just how much some
people would pay for bragging rights
though it was also a compute heavy price
though may be justified so I'm with all
that information the Pascal Titan series
climbed to $1200 us and our gamers
everywhere are in fear of how much the
next generation models are going to cost
so much needed competition from AMD will
certainly help here but even so the days
of $500 us flash of gaming GPUs are well
and truly over so while we would very
much like to see GPU prices calm down
and we beg that Nvidia not take
advantage of the current situation they
find themselves in the realities they
will so not sure that leaves us on that
one
first just let me start by saying I
don't think the game works program is
quite as bad as some what have you
believe but there are certainly been
some underhanded tactics that need to
stop firstly for those of you unaware
game works is an assortment of
proprietary technologies that NVIDIA
provides developers allowing them to
include cutting edge effects such as
realistic hair destruction and shadows
and it allows them to do all these
things without having to create them
from scratch however Nvidia seems too
often go out of their way let's say to
make sure these effects are done in a
way that makes them perform poorly on
AMD GPUs and sometimes they do this at
the expense of their own geforce
customers we have seen evidence in the
past of technologies clearly being
abused with the intention of giving
nvidia an advantage for example the use
of tessellation in Crysis and The
Witcher 3 now this situation has caused
backlash from gamers even those using in
video Hardware as these dirty tricks do
often hurt the performance of GeForce
graphics cards we've seen examples where
in video we'll take an unnecessarily
large performance it rather than
optimize an effect and they do is to
ensure the performance hit for AMD is
even greater and video of course denies
these claims but we've seen some pretty
hard evidence that this is indeed going
on
upon release we noticed a massive
performance hit using both aim D and
NVIDIA hardware when benchmarking the
Witcher 3 with hair works enabled I
reported a 55% reduction in performance
with the GTX 980 but a 67% drop for the
Radeon r9 290 with her works disabled
the GTX 980 was still 16% faster in the
online 290 that's a significant win
there for NVIDIA but with hair works
enabled the GeForce GPU was now 56%
faster there were a few issues with this
though firstly the game works feature
meant that gtx 980 owners were going
from a minimum of just over 60 FPS at
1080p with hair works disabled to less
than 30 FPS with it enabled this
actually led us at the time to recommend
that no one use hair works at all
however it was
I discovered that Nvidia were abusing
their tessellation performance advantage
at the expense of their own g-force
customers again we were seeing another
excessive use case by default the
tessellation level was set to time 64
despite the fact that no real visual
difference could be seen between times
16 and times 64 even when analyzing
screenshots you know side by side in
fact times 16 was barely any better than
times 8 well the times it was really
only slightly better than times 4 and
then by the time you drop it down times
2 that did make the effect look quite
poor reducing the tessellation level
from time 64 2 times 16 more than
doubled the frame rates for scenes that
made heavy use of hand works effects
while times 8 boost performance by a
further 20 percent in short using
tessellation times 8 provided basically
the same visuals with very little impact
on performance opposed to not using the
technology at all you can't really get
away with blaming the developer on this
one either which is why we've pretty
much pinned the blame
straight on Nvidia because it is well
documented that in video worked very
closely with The Witcher 3 team so from
my point of view it's either sabotage or
its incompetence so either way they
really do need to do better and we want
to stop seeing examples of game works
technologies being used to hurt the
competition opposed to enriching the
gaming experience we've also seen much
more recent examples of unjustifiably
large performances in game works titles
though thankfully we're all very well
aware of what seems to be going on so as
a result the final fantasy 15 issues was
sorted out quite quickly after the
initial benchmarking was complete and
the developer on that one seemed quite
happy to take the blame so perhaps it
was just an honest mistake
I didn't give AMD a hard time over
driver support and I'm not going to give
Nvidia a hard time either sometimes
display drivers aren't as good as they
could be but I feel overall for the most
part both companies do a pretty good job
after all ensuring that the current
generation of GPUs as well as quite a
few of the previous generations working
a massive range of games can't be an
easy job
so I'm gonna cut them a bit of slack on
that one that said I will still do a bit
of nitpicking and I'm going to target
the GeForce experience the software can
be quite clunky at times and in many
ways does feel outdated however my
biggest issue is the fact that in vidi
it makes you sign in to use the software
and in my opinion that's just totally
unnecessary of course this isn't a new
thing in video made this change quite a
few years ago now and we probably didn't
push back hard enough at the time I also
am aware that some of you may not see
this as a big deal an issue worth
raising at all and it's true that you
probably only have to manually log in
every now and then even so I feel like
if you're forking out hundreds and
hundreds of dollars for a GeForce GPU
that was really enough to have to avoid
handing over your details this one can
certainly be viewed as nitpicking and
technically the GeForce experience is
optional software but I just feel that
would have been a nice gesture for
Nvidia to offer it to their customers
with no strings attached
right so if you're watching this video
you've probably heard of the g-force
partner program or GPP if not here's a
quick refresher and video tried to get
all of their partners like a SUSE
gigabyte MSI and so on
to cite a document called the g-force
partner program that would impose heavy
restrictions on these companies the bad
parts of the document which was leaked
earlier this year by Kyle of hard OCP
suggest that if a company didn't align
their gaming brands exclusively with
g-force they would no longer receive
important development funds and other
incentives this is another one of those
anti-competitive an anti consumer moves
that Nvidia just seems to enjoy making
from time to time rather than simply
producing compelling products and going
about business fairly Nvidia feels the
need to shut out their competitors using
underhanded tactics GeForce graphics
cards particularly at the high end are
already better buys and NVIDIA holds far
more market share than AMD so it's just
bizarre that Nvidia continually feels
the need to bury competitors using shady
tactics just stop doing this sort of
rubbish in video put your products out
there let them compete on their own
merits and if they're good they'll win
over the consumers if you don't do shady
deals like the GP P in the background
you'll regain the trust of consumers and
you'll be genuinely seen as being on the
side of gamers that we know need to post
clearly garbage statements on your
website about how these dodgy deals
benefit gamers and are all about
transparency just play fair play nice
and ultimately do the right thing for
consumers
Jacek is another one of those things
that is frustrating for buyers and
really only serves to line in videos'
pockets with more cash now what g-sync
brings to monitors is actually pretty
good
adaptive sync support mandatory low
framerate compensation monitor
validation and so forth you can buy a
g-sync monitor and know you're getting
something quality but the way NVIDIA has
implemented g-sync is any consumer and
just plain unfriendly to all buyers
g-sync requires a dedicated hardware
module and that module only works within
video graphics cards the module is also
fairly costly adding approximately $200
u.s. to the price of any given monitor
this means any nvidia GPU owner wanting
to buy AG sync monitor needs to spend an
additional $200 u.s. compared to an AMD
GPU owner that has access to very
similar freesync technology for free
that sucks for those who have bought in
videos GPUs they have to spend an
additional $200 more because free sync
doesn't work within video cards and
there's no reason why NVIDIA GPUs can't
support free sync other than the fact
that in video wants to be greedy and
lock out their customers from competing
technologies a free sync is an open
standard in fact it's basically just
visa adaptive sync so Nvidia is free
very free to implement support whenever
they like and give nvidia gpus access to
cheaper adaptive sync monitors but they
don't of course because they can force
gamers into buying g-sync monitors while
locking AMD owners out of g-sync and
making it harder to switch GPU
ecosystems
it's another frustrating and you
consumer move from Nvidia and one we'd
like to see change so that was a long
one and not terribly enjoyable we just
discussed more than half a dozen things
that wastes consumers feel Nvidia needs
to address again this is merely a wish
list if you will we don't expect the new
video will address any of these concerns
we're nowhere near that naive but it
would be great to see them address a few
of these things over the next year or so
although this content piece has been
almost entirely negative
it's not to say that Nvidia hasn't
released some truly amazing products
with their GeForce 10 series because
they absolutely have we love the GTX
tonighti as an example we
a lot of the geforce cards the 1082 is
an incredible flagship GPU we use it for
pretty much all our benchmarking and
again we like the bulk of the Pascal
lineup which makes products such as the
GT 1030 ddr4 version all the more
disappointing anyway despite all the
negativity I hope you guys did enjoy the
video and the entire series for that
matter hopefully if we decide to revisit
this series next year we'll have less to
complain about from all three companies
as always thanks for watching and I look
forward to reading your thoughts in the
comment section down below I'm your host
