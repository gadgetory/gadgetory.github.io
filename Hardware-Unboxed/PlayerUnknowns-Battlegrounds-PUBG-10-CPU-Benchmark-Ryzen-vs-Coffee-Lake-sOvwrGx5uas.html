you had a relaxing and enjoyable break
over the Christmas period I've had about
four days of non-stop family gatherings
but they've been great and it's been
nice of a break from making videos that
said though I did sneak away each night
quite late and did a bit of benchmarking
I really wanted to check out the pub G
at one point o release the game has
finally left the early access status and
is now a fully release game that
happened on December 20th and I did
promise you guys once the game was
officially released that I would do a
big CPU benchmark and that'll probably
be followed by a GPU benchmark in the
not-too-distant future after revisiting
pub G performance earlier this month
I didn't benchmark on the test server
rather I looked at the performance most
gamers were being faced with at the time
it was a pretty grim situation with the
game max at at iupi the mighty GTX 1080i
with the support of the core i7 87 RK
was barely able to push a hundred fps
and often drop down into the 90s for a
game that looks pretty average let's say
in terms of visuals that was a pretty
weak result anyway the test server build
was showing better performance so I was
keen to retest the game once it was
officially released the plan was to test
the same section of the game for a
direct comparison and while I do want to
do this this isn't the point of this
particular video rather I've been really
keen to check out the framerate
performance using the new desert map
that and I couldn't actually get a game
with it with a load into the original
map so that was a bit frustrating right
now you can't actually select which map
you want to play on apparently the map
selection is just completely random well
anyway I tried about 20 games across
multiple servers and every time I ended
up on the desert map so in a way this is
kind of where I've been forced to test
for now anyway something very cool about
the release version is the replay
feature the game now automatically
records every match so you can play it
back this is particularly useful for
benchmarking as it's now possible to
test the exact same pass over and over
again
I also found a little trick that makes
it possible to jump right into the
action rather than having to watch the
entire replay from the start see
parachute into the hot zone and when you
land hit alt f4 and this will abruptly
close the game then you have to quickly
reopen the game and when you hit start
it will give you the option to rejoin
the match where you left so that's
pretty cool
the game then loads you into the exact
spot you dropped from and you can
continue from there I played for about
two minutes then exited to the lobby and
this created a two minute past made a
benchmark over and over again no longer
do I have to suffer through countless
passes were end up getting killed the
only remaining issue now is that the
game still has a 144 FPS cap and the
previous method of removing it no longer
works I wasn't able to find a workaround
in time for this video but if you know
of a way to disable the frame cap then
please feel free to share it below in
the comment section now last time I
benchmark CP performance in pub G the
AMD Verizon CPUs got completely
annihilated by the Intel competition
especially the quad core verizon parts
no tech gasm who is a very knowledgeable
code monkey explained this is due to the
fact that pub G is built using the
Unreal Engine 4 which is only optimized
for Intel architectures and we have seen
a bit of this in the past though pub G
is certainly one of the more extreme
examples we've seen for now the focus is
likely on fixing the plethora of bugs
rather than optimizing CPU instructions
anyway if you guys haven't checked out
nerd tech Kazim's channel I strongly
suggest you do as a lot of very
interesting and educational videos
relating to CPU and GPU tech I'll
include a link in the video description
now for testing I've walked through the
town of loosely earnest for 60 seconds
and this is more than enough time to
gather the data we need once again I've
taken 16 different am being and Intel
CPUs benchmark commentary P using me
very low medium and ultra quality
presets with a GeForce GTX tonight using
the latest 388 dot 71 display driver all
unlocked Intel CPUs along with the Rison
CPUs have been tested using ddr4 they'll
do 200 CL 14 memory meanwhile the locked
Intel CPUs were tested using ddr4 2400
cell 14 memory so for example the core
i3 80 350 K was tested with 3200 memory
but the core i3 8100 used
2400 memory I've also noted the CPU
utilization of all 16 CPUs tested for
those of you interested and that can be
towards the end of the video so let's
jump into the benchmark results first up
we have the very low quality preset
results and here the 7th and 8th gen
Intel Core series of processors look to
be mostly limited by the games 144fps
frame cap the quad-core eyes and CPUs
really look to be struggling with the 1%
low results though there is a huge
margin between the minimum and average
FPS results were pretty much all the
CPUs tests and I'll talk a bit more
about this soon increasing the quality
setting seems to impact the Intel CPUs
more than the AMD CPUs though of course
many of the Intel CPUs are still being
limited by the frame cap still here the
Rison 7 1800 X is able to just pull the
head of the core i3 8100 what a sad
statement that is unfortunately for AMD
Verizon gets hit with a double whammy
and pub G not only is the game more
optimized for Intel hardware but it also
doesn't utilize more than four cores
very well as evident when comparing the
7600 K and 77 RK using the gtx 1080i at
turn DP moving on we have the ultra
quality preset results and now we see
something rather interesting although
the more powerful Intel CPU such as the
87 okay 8600 K and 8400 for example are
all still hitting the frame cap the 1%
low results are shockingly low in fact
when it comes to the smoothness factor
the AMD and Intel CPUs deliver a very
similar experience I found that while
both were relatively smooth for the most
part every twenty to thirty seconds or
so there'd be a noticeable stutter and
this was true for all the hardware
configurations tested this is obviously
an issue with the game I noticed that
this often happened when looking around
quickly or entering a building for the
first time so while Intel completely
stomps most of the Rison range for the
average framerate the overall experience
was very much the same looking at how
the various quality presets impact CPU
performance we find quite a large
variation in the 1% lower results for
the 8th gen core processes such as the
87 or ok and 80 100 interestingly the
very low preset provided a much smoother
experience opposed to the ultra for the
8th gen Intel Core processors the dual
core pentium g 45 60 created such an
extreme sifu bottleneck that changing
the quality settings didn't really have
that much of an impact on performance
the 1% low results for the arisin see
abuse wasn't impacted significantly
either for the most part the difference
between the low and medium quality
settings was almost non-existent when it
came to CP utilization I found a similar
story to the previous test he the rise
in CPUs are woefully underutilized in
particular rise in CPUs with SMT support
are very poorly utilized and again this
comes back to the game engine being
optimized for Intel CPUs and therefore
hyper threading technology so while some
might look at the results and claim that
rise in CPU is a useless for gaming the
real issue here being the game is
useless at utilizing rise in CPUs by the
way these are the maximum utilization
figures seen throughout the 60-second
benchmark pass before wrapping things up
here is a quick side-by-side comparison
between a few of the CPUs tested here
you can monitor things like the CPU
usage as well as the framerate
note here that the minimum frame rate is
of course the minimum frames per second
and not a frame time rating where we
look within the second
I'll let this footage play for about a
minute and then we'll wrap things up
so as we found last time player on owns
battlegrounds really does play best with
Intel hardware at least for those
seeking big frame rates with high-end
GPUs
truth be told though the experience on
something like a 6 or 8 core eyes and
CPU really is just as good though it was
pretty shoddy on the quad core eyes and
CPUs even those with SMT enabled such as
the 1500 X and 1400 which is quite
surprising
in fact in a way that proves that the
game really has no idea what to do with
those SMT threads for example the
difference between the 1500 X which is a
4 core 8 thread CPU and the 1,300 X
which is a 4 core 4 thread it's really
hard to spot the difference between
those two
and unfortunately the 1500 X like the
1300 X was quite stuttering at times so
very disappointing results there and
that was true even with the lowest
possible quality settings the best
budget configuration would consist of an
Intel quad core Core i5 6400 or
something like that would work really
well and probably deliver a similar
experience to the Rison 7 1800 X once
you compare the core i3 8100 with an
affordable motherboard that would
probably be the ultimate budget pubsey
configuration there's really no
noticeable difference going from an
Intel 4 core to a 6 core CPU in this
tile apart from the CPU also want 16
gigabytes of RAM for the best results
and of course you will want the fastest
GPU you can afford
I'll also benchmark a stack of GPUs soon
somewhere in the vicinity of 30 to 40
new and old graphics cards that will
most likely happen midway through next
month unfortunately through my testing I
found that the game does appear to be
quite stutter at times even with
high-end hardware so although we're out
of the unity access period now there's
still loads of work to be done but I
doubt that'll surprise anyone who's been
following the game's development if you
monitor the framerate in game the
minimum fps is actually quite
respectable but you might still notice
that the odds stuttering or frame
hitches here and there especially when
you zip around or look quite quickly
you'll sort of get a bit of a jerk or a
stutter and the minimum fps or the
frames per second doesn't necessarily
catch that but you'll definitely see it
in the frame time results and looking at
those frame time results which are those
one percenter low figures certainly
reveals the stuttering that I noticed
every now and then things have certainly
improved from the last benchmark session
at least we're looking at the average
frame rates they've all been boosted
quite a bit the stuttering that I saw
every now and then every 30 seconds or
so that was a little bit concerning
hopefully that gets ironed out I'm not
sure what was going on there I don't
recall seeing that as often in the
previous version that I tested even
though the averages will lower could be
down to the map because obviously I'm
testing the desert map this time not the
original map so there may be a bit of
difference there in the optimization but
either way I hope that we can see quite
a few improvements come in the next few
months for the performance hey wait
that's going to do it for this one I'm
your host Steve see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
