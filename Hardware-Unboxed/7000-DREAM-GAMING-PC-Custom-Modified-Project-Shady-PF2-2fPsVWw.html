have a special custom build from Alex of
simple mods for you now alex is a
talented pc model who also happens to be
a fellow Aussie so a teaming up to show
you some of his awesome custom builds I
think you guys are really going to enjoy
this video so sit back I'll hand it over
to Alex and he'll quickly tell you a bit
about the build before showing you a
time-lapse of its creation hey what's
going on guys I'm Alex and as Steve said
I'm a PC case motor
I've built some pretty crazy custom
systems such as this one and I'm very
happy to be here thinning up with hard
round box to show you guys some of my
latest creations so I really hope you're
gonna enjoy this video now this is a
system I built towards the end of last
year in the in Wendy frame mini which
has been modified to fit an M ATX
motherboard and I've of course also
decked it out with full custom hard line
water cooling and a crazy marble looking
gold paint job the system does have some
sentimental value to me as I've built it
in the memory of my black lab shady who
passed away in 2016 hence the name for
the project project Shady
I have his silhouette laser etched onto
the tempered glass side panel along with
his paw so when the panel is on and the
build sits on my desk it's sort of like
he's watching over my system the gold
team came from what sits at the heart of
this rig and at the 10th anniversary ek
supremacy Evo a CPU waterblock
number 32 out of only 100 ever made I'd
have to get up around 3 a.m. here in
Australia when ek first announced these
around January last year but I
definitely think it was worth it and I'm
proud to display such a unique piece of
hardware in my system the rest of the
specs consists of a Intel i7 69 50 X on
the Asus x99 M workstation motherboard
duo gtx 980ti found this Edition
graphics cards all custom water cooled
using ek water blocks there's a 240
millimeter rad in the front there's also
one at the bottom with the BDC pump
custom mounted to it and the reservoir
will hide around the back it's also got
32 gigs of g.skill trident z RGB 2200
megahertz ddr4 memory which of course is
fully customizable using g.skill
software on this motherboard and in
terms of storage i decided to keep it
simple with just a single one terabyte
samsung 960 Evo nvme m2 SSD and it's
also got the
900 watt power supply and all the custom
cables are from cable mod so I'm gonna
kick off the time-lapse from here so you
guys can see how I created the system
and the kind of work that went into it I
do hope you guys enjoyed this video and
I just want to say a huge thanks to
Steve for having me on board
I'm sure he'll put down some links in
the video description so you guys can
follow some of my channels and get a
behind-the-scenes look at what I get up
to when I build these systems and also
maybe you want to check out some of my
previous work I have quite a few more of
these on the way and I do have to bring
you guys a lot more videos just like
this one right here on hadron boxed
