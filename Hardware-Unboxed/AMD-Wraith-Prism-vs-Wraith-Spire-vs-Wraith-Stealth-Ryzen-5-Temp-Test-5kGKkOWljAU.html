we're checking how the new AMD box
coolers compare not sure why but this
has been heavily requested video so i've
made it happen
we've got your race Stealth's your
spires and even your prisms so got the
whole gang to check out just quickly for
those of you unaware the second gen
rising process has come with one of the
three wraith models i just mentioned the
horizon 7 2700 x is the only model to
come with the fancy-looking wraith prism
and it's also the only processor to
sport a 105 watt TDP rating so the part
does clearly call for a much beefier
cooler and a much beefier cooler it gets
as the wraith prism weighs in at 580
grams
i think the fan alone weighs more than
intel's box cooler the horizon 7 2700
and risin 5 2600 x get the wraith spire
this model tips the scales at 372 grams
making a 36% lighter but it does still
sport a copper slug in the base then we
have the 9 X 2600 which gets the little
Wraith stealth weighing just 317 grams
making it 15% lighter than the spire and
a whopping 45 percent lighter than the
Wraith Prizm I'm assuming those of you
who bought a risin 5 2601 and oh if it's
worth buying the race spire or prism
secondhand they often appear for sale on
eBay for example likewise those with the
2600 X or 2700 want to know how much
better the prism is than the spire so
I'll be comparing all three coolers on
the arisin 5 2600 using these stock
settings as well as a 4 gigahertz all
core overclock are we monitoring both
the CPU and vrm temperatures during an
hour-long blender workload as well as
the 30-minute overwatch bot match the
coolers have also been tested inside the
deep cool new arc 90 a large full tower
ATX case that comes with an all-in-one
liquid cooler pre-installed of course
when using the Box coolers the
all-in-one liquid cooler has been pushed
aside but we will still be using the 4
140 millimeter fans that are
pre-installed though all these fans are
configured as exhaust fans so if you are
using this case I would probably
recommend putting a few intake fans in
the front for this test though I went
with the limited air flows
as the point of testing inside a case
and not an open testbed is to more
realistically simulate the conditions
you'd probably be using these air
coolers in it's also winter here so I'm
testing a rather cool 20 degree room as
it is having said that in a follow-up
video I will fit the new arc 90 with
more fans and install the horizon 7 2700
I test at how well that build works with
the liquid cooler for now though let's
compare the only box coolers first up
I've measured peak temperatures after 30
minutes of playing overwatch during our
bot match stress test using the wraith
prism saw the 2600 peak at just 47
degrees which is very cool and the vrm
temperature never exceeded 43 degrees so
these are exceptional temperatures for a
reasonably heavy gaming load and
speaking of which the CPU utilization
hovers around 50% in this test because
of these low temperatures the prism fan
never spun faster than 1600 rpm and at
that speed is virtually silent moving to
the Wraith spire increased the low
temperatures by 6 degrees and although
the CPU is now running hotter the fan
speed for the spire only maxed at at
1,700 rpm so the operating volume was
much the same vrm temperatures also
remain much the same as well then with
the Wraith stealth we see a further 7
degree increase for the low temperature
and now things are starting to get warm
at 60 degrees remember we are only half
pushing the CPU in this test so let's
move on to 100% load with blender so
running the blender workload for an hour
increases the wraith prism load
temperature to 57 degrees and that's a
10 degree increase over what we saw in
gaming the fan speed has also increased
2,000 rpm but even here the prism still
was basically silent this time around
the Wraith spire was 8 degrees hotter
than the prism as temperatures hit 65
degrees though that is still very cool
by all accounts and again the fan only
spun at 2,000 rpm then finally with the
cool that comes with the 2600 the Wraith
stealth we see temperatures hitting 72
degrees and now we are getting up there
ideally you don't want temperatures
going too far beyond 70 degrees for
prolonged use that said you could
increase the fan speed for better
results as even the stealth while
spinning at just 2000 rpm I should note
though that the spire and stealth do a
good job pushing air over the
motherboards VRM
okay so I've overclocked
20600 by pushing all cause to 4
gigahertz using 1.2 volts and this only
increased the CPUs operating temperature
by a few degrees and overwatch fan
speeds also remained much the same the
vrm temp did increase by 4 to 5 degrees
but under 40 degrees that's nothing to
be concerned about of course we are
using a high-end x4 70 board but still
cool temps on the vrm now for the 100%
load test using blender we sent the
Wraiths prism hits 63 degrees which is 6
degrees hotter than what we saw with the
stock test and now it is just possible
to hear the fan as it spins up to 2200
rpm the r8 spire allows the overclocked
2600 to reach 70 degrees and with the
fan now spinning at 2700 rpm it's quite
easy to hear the race stealth also hit
2700 rpm making it reasonably loud and
despite that temperatures still hit 87
degrees that's an almost 40% increase in
operating temperature from the prism
before wrapping things up here is a
quick look at how the spire and prism
compared to the ultra affordable deep
called gamax 200 T presently this 120
millimeter tower cooler cost $115 us on
Amazon and proved to be a valuable
upgrade for the arisin 320 200 G and
risin 5 2400 G as both ap use are
bundled with the Wraith stealth for
Rison 520 600 owners it will net you
Wraith prism light performance when
gaming though it is worth noting that
the 120 millimeter fan does do a much
better job of cooling the vrm at least
it did on our X 470 board the game ax
202 also appears to be a decent upgrade
option for the horizon 520 600 X and r7
2700 now with the risin 5 2600 under
100% load in our blender workload the
game x 200 T is more comparable to the
Wraith spire making it a bit hotter than
the prism although less impressive under
these conditions it is still a solid
upgrade option for Wraith stealth owners
well I hope for those of you who have
been requesting this comparison between
this stealth spire and prism that the
testing has satisfied you if you have a
rising v 2600 or any other AMD CPU that
comes bundled with a wraith stealth
cooler then you will ideally want to
upgrade that for something better
just to improve the thermal performance
especially if you plan on overclocking
seems like
a lot of you do want to stick with an
AMD brand and cooler and while I agree
they do look pretty cool they're not
really cost-effective and looking at
places like eBay for the Wraith prism
they're selling for around $40 u.s. and
that doesn't include shipping and for
that kind of money you can get a
seriously good air cooler
remember the deep core game ax 200 T is
a very affordable budget option and even
it wasn't much worse than the prism
under 100% load in fact I'm willing to
bet these slightly bigger gamax 300 is
able to outperform the prism so if you
can do without the AMD branding then I
suggest you look elsewhere for your
cooler upgrade I'm very keen to hook up
the liquid cooler in the new arc 90 to
see how well that works and then of
course up the thermal load with the
horizon 7 2700 x4 now though that is
going to do it for this one if you did
