time to get back into some monitored
testing messing a bit of a backlog here
at the office so I thought I would kick
things off by testing the msi MPG 3:41
cqr this is a display that I saw at
Computex and it really caught my eye for
a number of reasons
it's a 34 inch ultra wide at 34 40 by
1440 which I love but it hits 144 Hertz
with a VA panel and does so for an MSRP
of 899 US dollars when launches globally
next month this isn't the first monitor
that does 34 40 by 1440 at 144 Hertz
we've already seen that from LG's 34 GK
950 F but every sized offering is a
little different it's a VA panel instead
of IPs and crucially it costs 300
dollars less than LG's $1200 asking
price the 34 GK 950 F does occasionally
go on sale at below $1,000 but I haven't
seen one for a while and in general LG's
monitors have been hard to find so I
think it's safe to say that generally
this msi option will be cheaper and
offers a higher refresh rate than
popular 120 hertz monitors like the
Alienware a w3 4 1 8 DW or the Acer
predator x 34 p4 around the same price
so it could be a great value for what
it's offering let's kick things off by
you guessed it looking at the design msi
optics range tends to be more geared
towards the gamer end of the spectrum it
doesn't go as crazy say in a soos rog
monitor but it's similar to the aces of
the world on the rear you'll find a
mishmash of different plastic finishes
there's glossy and matte sections a
large RGB strip all those cool effects
you won't see in regular operation I
mean it's a fine design I personally
prefer a more minimalist look but at
least it's well-constructed and doesn't
feel cheap The Stand has taken some
inspiration from a soos with a copper
colored section that joins the stand
legs to the pillar the legs are a sturdy
metal and take up less space than some
other ultra Y designs they've seen with
height tilt and swivel adjustability
built in it's a good stand overall and
is extremely sturdy with very little
wobble from the front you'll notice MSI
signature RGB LED bars which can be used
for simple effects like this rainbow or
some in-game information like health and
ammo through syncing with mystic light
and SteelSeries game sense for normal
operation I find the RGB lights a bit
distracting but for some gamers they
might find the functionality useful and
at least it's somewhat innovative and
isn't just hiding the RGB lights on the
rear where no one will ever see it for
inputs we have two hdmi 2.0 ports
DisplayPort 1.4 and a USB C input that
operates via DP alta mode there's also a
three port USB hub and some audio jacks
so a decent range of connectivity for
the on-screen display there are two ways
to control them one of those features
you can use the directional toggle on
the back of the monitor always nice to
see that or you can hook up the monitor
via USB and use MSI's gaming OSD
application basically all of the
features can be controlled through here
like this screen assistance crosshair
cheats there are fresh straight info
color settings backlight strobing anti
motion blur modes and more it's a good
range of features and functionality but
as far as this stuff is concerned it's
pretty similar to many competitors I do
like the inclusion of a macro key on the
bottom left corner of the monitor though
which can be mapped to a functional
setting haven't really seen that before
you might have also spotted the camera
in the middle of the bottom bezel this
is another innovative inclusion by MSI I
guess you have to applaud them at least
for thinking outside the box a little
with some of these features the camera
can operate as a basic low quality
webcam but MSI has added in some
additional functionality as well you can
use the camera for automatic brightness
adjustment which is neat and works well
if you don't want to mess around with
changing the brightness level I found it
said a good level of brightness for the
ambient light in my office the other
feature is it can use facial detection
to set a bunch of settings depending on
who sits in front of the monitor so for
example with multiple people use the
same PC and monitor but like a different
monitor setups the camera can detect who
is sitting there and make the
adjustments automatically now this does
sound cool and in my testing it worked
fine but I just don't think it's all
that useful most monitor settings are
set and forget or really aren't that
important to change others like cheat
crosshairs you're probably going to
enable based on what you're doing not
who specifically is in front of the
monitor having this functionality seems
pretty nation isn't really a big selling
point in my opinion also included in the
box is a mouse bungee and a webcam or
camera mount both neat in the box
freebies and the camera mount in
particular could be useful for streamer
types I don't think the monitor would be
all that much cheaper without these
additions so no problem with MSI trying
to add value in this way it's again a
bit of out-of-the-box thinking I think
it's pretty neat enough about this stuff
let's get into some performance numbers
and we'll start with the refresh rate
here the MPG 3:41 cqr clocks in with a
maximum refresh rate of 144 hertz and it
supports free sync that works with both
AMD and NVIDIA cards we're also getting
low framerate compensation here so the
effective minimum refresh is 1 Hertz and
that's all good if standard signs across
the ultrawide monitor market 144 Hertz
seems to be coming in and replacing the
spot that 120 Hertz held among high-end
34:40 by 1440 monitors so you're getting
a 44% increase to refresh rate over
entry-level 100 Hertz panels and that's
quite a significant difference if you
play up in the high end of that refresh
rate I can definitely tell the
difference in smoothness and to me it's
a more worthwhile upgrade over 100 Hertz
than 120 Hertz was however those with
120 Hertz panels aren't going to rush
out by a display that's only 17% faster
and that's not a huge enough difference
to be noticeable the question with most
VA panels is can the display actually
transition fast enough to support this
refresh rate for 144 Hertz there a fresh
window is six point nine four
milliseconds so we need most transitions
to be faster than that to get a true 144
Hertz experience and I'm happy to say
that on average the greater great
transition time was four point five
seven milliseconds with around 90% of
all transitions falling within the
refresh window so in general this panel
is comfortably suitable for 144 Hertz
gamming while I did test with the
fastest response time setting there is
still some dark level smearing which is
common for VA panels but is unwanted
it's not the worst smearing I've
measured but transition times around 20
to 25 milliseconds for the worst of the
bunch isn't amazing however to get the
overall average down to below 5
milliseconds there are plenty of
transitions around 3 more seconds so
this VA panel in general is fast but
it's also quite inconsistent this is in
contrast to the LG 34 JK 950 F which
also does 144 Hertz it's a slower
monitor overall with a greater great
average of six point zero nine
milliseconds however there are no dark
levels smearing issues and the range
between transitions is much narrower as
an IPS panel the 34 GK 950
can suffer from its own issues like glow
and backlight bleed so it just depends
what you're after
as for MSI's claims that the MPG 3:41
cqr has a one millisecond response time
that's not really true from a greater
great average perspective but the
monitor does have a back light strobing
mode so it probably refers to that input
lag was also good at around 3 and 1/2
milliseconds so within the standard
range for gaming monitors so no issues
here brightness is an interesting
situation MSI claims 400 nits of
brightness but I only achieved a touch
under 300 nits anything around this
level is still fine most people will use
the monitor in the 100 to 200 nits range
but I was a little surprised at MSI spec
sheet same story for the contrast ratio
MSI claims 3000 to 1 but in my testing
it was my twenty one hundred to one
three thousand to one tends to be the
standard Va contrast ratio so maybe MSI
just filled that in here but it's quite
common as you can see from the chart for
ultra wide vs 2 o'clock in more around
two thousand to one natively when
compared to the LG 34 GK 950 F
brightness is similar but contrast is
one area where the VI panel is superior
in fact despite only posting a 2100 to 1
contrast ratio this is twice as good as
LG's IPS panel and with lower black
levels it will deliver better shadow
performance in dark rooms color
performance is also an interesting
battle between the MSI and LG monitors
LG's nano IPS panel is produced to a
wide gamut with 95% DCI p3 coverage in
my testing EMA site is using a VA panel
here which is claimed to be 105 percent
srgb or 84 percent DCI p3 so a bit above
srgb but not really a true wide gamut
panel I achieved a 3% DCI p3 in my
testing so pretty close to Emma size
specs but really this isn't good enough
for white Gama it's more just providing
a slight over saturation to srgb most of
the time however for gaming monitors
delivering srgb and not worrying about
wide gamut often delivers a better
experience given most games are srgb in
an SDR mode this is true here MSI's
factory calibration for the MGP 3:41 cqr
is pretty decent they targeted a sub 2.0
Delta II average and largely got it in
grayscale the monitor does have somewhat
over red tint to whites but gamma
performance is decent and overall we're
still sitting a delta average of just
one point seven seven such
and performance is interesting in that
while the monitor does exceed srgb at
the top-end
midtones especially for reds and blues
are actually slightly under saturated so
we get a delta average of 2.35 here
color checker is wealth is right on that
Delta a average of 2.0 which is very
good for a gaming monitor out of the box
and certainly much better than others in
this class in fact out of the box
performance for ms is monitor is better
than LG's the 34 gk9 50 have had a few
issues with its srgb mode and tinting
out of the box which led to higher Delta
averages when comparing against srgb
LG's monitor does have an advantage when
calibrated and is better for wide gamut
professional work for example but for
your average gamer that won't calibrate
the display MSI delivers a better
default experience now I did mention
that my mpg 3:41 cqr came with a slight
red tint that can be corrected through a
few OSD tweaks and then the results to
improve Delta averages tighten up to
below 2.0 across the board and the
mid-tone saturation issue improves
somewhat a full calibration does take
things up another knotch to be even
better so that's always an option for
those with calibration hardware and as
always the results are very accurate
there the ICC profile we created for
this model is available for our patrons
to download as for uniformity the mpg
3:41 cqr is average in this regard the
central zone isn't particularly uniform
but it isn't terrible either this is the
standard sort of result you get from a
curved VA ultra line in contrast LG's
IPS panel in the 34 GK 950 F is more
uniform and has been a viewing angle so
if those things mounted to you the LG
option is better I'll touch briefly on
HDR heat to round out the testing the
MPG 3:41 CQI is advertised as being
displayed HDR 400 certified but as you
can see from the checklist it's plainly
not an HDR capable monitor brightness is
too low there's no local dimming so
there is no high dynamic range aspect to
the displays contrast and the color
space isn't large enough for proper wide
gamut support so it fails all three
pillars of HDR you might be wondering
well this monitor only does around 300
minutes of brightness so how did it pass
display HDR 400 certification doesn't
that require 400 nits well MSI told me
the settings they used for testing and
it involves setting the monitor to 100
contrast among other
which is not color accurate and in some
situations is pretty unusable under
these things I got within 5% of 400 nits
so it technically passed a certification
but in real-world usage with practical
settings it's a fair way off not that I
think this is a big deal in general
given that most display HD are 400
monitors really aren't HD are capable to
begin with so as always you've seen a
bunch of data and I think overall the
MSI mpg 3:41 cqr is a pretty decent
display it doesn't revolutionize the
ultra wide gaming monitor market it's
mostly just incremental steps forward
here but there are some aspects that are
better than average and for some buyers
I think that will be enough to satisfy
the two things MSI really delivers on
here are the refresh rate and the
out-of-the-box colors yes there's a bit
of dark level smearing here but for the
majority of transitions the MGP 3:41 cqr
is fast and comfortably able to
transition to keep up with the 144 Hertz
refresh rate color performance out of
the box is pretty close to a delta T
average of 2.0 which is well above
average for a gaming monitor and means
it just looks great without needing many
tweaks on top of that we can add in a
bunch of bonuses msi has a good array of
OSD features there's a few extra bits
and bobs thrown in the box the monitor
has a great build quality the RGB
lighting might be useful to some people
the contrast ratio is decent if a little
low and input lag is very good when you
add all those things together
MSI is delivering a great gaming
experience with this monitor the main
issues to me of things that are largely
inherent to using this sort of VI panel
dark level smearing is one another is
weak uniformity and a lack of proper
wide gamut support MSI were also a bit
overzealous with their spec sheet the
monitor under performs a little compared
to what they list an HDR performance is
non-existent but I do think the game is
those two things really don't matter all
that much the big question is whether
you should buy the mpg 3:41 cqr or go
for LG's 34 GK 950 F both 144 Hertz
options a lot of this will come down to
price MSI choppering going on the MSRP
is 25% cheaper and considering many of
the differences are not crucial for
gamers it will be a much better option
and the one I'd choose in most
circumstances but there are some things
the LG
does better lack start level smearing
issues although it's slower overall it
has better uniformity viewing angles and
wide gamut support but isn't as well
factory calibrated it has slightly
better brightness both options despite
being advertised as HDR 400 monitors
really don't deliver an HJ experience so
neither is better for HDR gaming don't
get me wrong both the great monitors but
given the pros and cons I'd swing
towards the msi monitor for those that
will be primarily gaming and just want a
high quality fast ultra wide if you do a
bit of content creation as well as
gaming I think that's where I'd opt for
the lg monitor if you have the extra
money to spend although honestly the MGP
3:41 cqr is still a good option given
its calibration and lower price as is
the case with high and ultra whines I
should point out that if you don't
specifically want or need 144 Hertz
there are some great budget options
these days 100 Hertz displays like the
msi ma g3 41 c q and just 430 US dollars
which is under half the price of the MGP
340 1cq are the high refresh models have
better panels overall and are more
future-proof options but I still feel
$900 is a bit too expensive here yes
MSI's monitor is the best value out
there and I would definitely buy it over
slightly cheaper 120 Hertz monitors if
you want a high refresh ultra wide but
it's definitely expensive compared to
entry-level options I think the sweet
spot here will be around the six to
seven hundred dollar mark hopefully the
price of these panels will filter down
to a point where that sort of pricing is
viable that's it for this review of the
msi optics MPG 3:41 cqr this monitor
should hit the market in the next few
weeks I think it's slated for August in
the United States and it's definitely
one to look out for if you're interested
in a high-end ultra wide with a high
refresh rate I think it's quite good I
