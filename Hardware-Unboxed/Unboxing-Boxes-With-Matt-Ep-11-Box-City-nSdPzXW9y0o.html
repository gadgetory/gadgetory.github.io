unboxing boxes with Matt the number one
show on the Internet
this is episode number 11 and I've got a
bit of a dilemma let me show you guys so
as you can see there's a whole lot of
stuff here and I'm not really sure what
I'm gonna unbox yet but I figure it out
No alright this is on top so get into it
I literally have no idea what to see
well it's obviously a keyboard but I
really don't know who it's from or what
it is just be roughly a garbage bag a
mantis stick is brown switches right
blue how do i box
I don't recall being informed that
ultimately sent this set brown switches
they definitely sound like blues to me
she's a kind of glittery we've got that
bright blue back plate so pretty cool
looking I don't know if this
backlighting there's backlighting so
we'll find out if it's a jeebies
okay that's from man to stick Manta
stick obviously I don't know why I
couldn't finance that Manta stick and
I'll put the buy link in the description
below alright what's next let's go with
this one
small little package right so here we
have some g.skill Trident Zed memory so
I've got a really cool build coming up
it's a $1200 gaming PC and g.skill were
kind enough to send this over so it's
gonna fit right in with the color scheme
and uh you guys some keep an eye out for
that in the next couple of weeks
all right what's next
this sounds from creative one of my
favorite companies and again I really
can't remember what they've sent over so
let's find out together in a convenient
pack got some Singaporean newspaper cool
cool now remember I've released a couple
of new Bluetooth speakers this is the
movie - it's pretty cool looking
Bluetooth speaker splash proof obviously
not sure how the sound is yet but I'm
assuming it's pretty good it's really
quite light takes an SD card I'm still
in charge just through a micro USB it
looks like it takes a wrist strap but
doesn't come with one then we've got the
mover to seize so there's two of these I
assume you can link them up together and
get stereo sound also splash proof six
hour battery so anyway I look forward to
checking these out and seeing how they
sound all right on to the next one this
looks a lot like a motherboard size box
and I'm pretty sure he's a little be
full at twelve hundred dollar bill that
I talked about
so inside we've got as Rock said 170
fatality gaming k4 so awesome little
motherboard and again it fits right in
with the color scheme which you guys
will see when I do the $1200 build in a
couple of weeks time so keep your eyes
peeled for that one all right last one
good one box is this big one
oh so here we've got the cooler master
master box five so this is the case I'm
gonna be using in that build that I keep
mentioning and this is a really cool
looking case that I've been looking for
an excuse to use in a build for quite
some time so I'm really looking forward
to putting it together
and the best part now you can see what
looks like inside so I've got the case
I've got the motherboard and I've got
the memory so next week I'm hoping to
have everything I need so I can put
together for you thanks for joining me
