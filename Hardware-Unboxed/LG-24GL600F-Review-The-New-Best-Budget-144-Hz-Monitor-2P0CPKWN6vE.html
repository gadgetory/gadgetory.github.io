is a new intro video I'm sure you guys
will let us know what you think of it in
the comments below but for now I have
got a massive pile of monitors at my
place to test so it's finally time to
get back into the swing of things
and start reviewing some of these
displays today we're starting with the
most affordable of the pack the lg ultra
gear 24 GL 600 ft a distorted gaming
display it's 24 inches in size packs a
1080p resolution at 144 Hertz uses a TN
LCD panel and includes free sync support
so it's your typical entry of a high
refresh display with that said it's
probably a little on the expensive side
for these specifications currently
retailing for 230 dollars in the US and
300 bucks here in Australia so we'll
have to see if this monitor does
anything special to justify that price
from a design perspective it's all very
basic although in this price tear that's
not necessarily a bad thing the
construction is mostly plastic it's
simple bezels aren't slim but there's
also nothing crazy going on here in
terms of gaming elements there's a few
red highlights on the stand and on the
rear to go along with the mostly matte
black design but otherwise just a very
straightforward uncontroversial build
perhaps the only thing LG does
drastically different from other monitor
vendors is having the port's directly
accessible on the back panel rather than
facing towards the desk from beneath
this makes it easier to plug in things
but it's not as nice for cable
management here you get one DisplayPort
to HDMI ports and 3.5 millimeter audio
output jack as far as the stand is
concerned there's not much adjustability
here which again is a typical trait for
an entry-level monitor you're only
getting tilt adjustment and because this
is a 24 inch display tends to sit fairly
low down on your desk height
adjustability would be nice but that
requires a more complex stand design
which would increase the price you do
get standard base and mounting options
though if you want to add that in later
one thing I am pleased to see is that
the 24 GL 600 F uses a directional
toggle for accessing the on screen
options this is one of the few budget
class monitors I've seen to include this
most other monitors use horrible face
buttons for the difficult
to use LG has done the right thing here
and as a result the collection of
options are pretty easy to navigate what
we're getting feature wise is nothing
special LG's included the standard range
of features you've probably also seen
from its competitors I'm talking about
cheap crosshairs a black frame insertion
mode called one millisecond motion blur
reduction there are some shadow boosting
options and a typical range of color
controls it's nice that some of the game
specific options have a description to
let you know what they do I think that's
a pretty good inclusion in terms of
panel again we're looking at a flat
twenty three point six inch 1080p TN one
of the reasons you might choose this
sort of panel is its speed which I'll
get to shortly all of the major
downsides are the viewing angles this
display doesn't have the worst viewing
angles I've seen from a TN but all the
usual problems are visible here such as
contrast shifts at pretty much any angle
except for dead-on this should be fine
for gamers that use this display as
their primary monitor particularly if
you position it properly but as a second
monitor of anything to do with content
creation I probably not recommend it
response times though is strong which is
good news for gamers that want the
clearest possible image this panel is
rated for one millisecond response times
and in my testing I found a greater
great average of 3.42 milliseconds which
is fairly typical for a one millisecond
rated TN in general this makes the 24 G
or 600 F about twice as fast as
equivalent VA panels in this class so if
you are concerned about smearing or
ghosting this TN will provide a better
experience in that regard for those
wondering these results were recorded
using the default fast response time
setting as the faster mode introduced a
noticeable overshoot fast is my
recommendation here also important to
note is that the refresh rate range II
is 48 to 144 hurt so we are getting full
low frame rate compensation with free
sync and have previously verified this
display to work perfectly within video
cards as well as AMD cards the other
factor the test here is input latency
which again is very good at just a few
milliseconds when you combine this with
the fast response times and high refresh
rate with adaptive sync we're getting a
great combination of speed for gamers it
may be a sub to $50 monitor but the
gaming experience here is really good
where this TN falls down and this is an
unusual for a TN is in most areas of
color performance as well as having weak
viewing angle
the 24 gr 600 F uses what I believe is
just a 6 bit panel with 8-bit color
achieved through FRC it's rare to find a
native 8 bit TN panel and from looking
at some quantization tests this does
appear to be just 6 bit which will
disappoint the color purists out there
brightness is find at around 300 nits
peak as is the contrast ratio which is
better than average at 1100 to 1 this is
roughly on par with LG's typical
specifications and I think you'd be
pretty unlucky to get a unit that's more
around the minimum values they've listed
default color performance is a bit of a
tale of two worlds in terms of grayscale
performance the 24 GL 600 F is
respectable especially for an
entry-level display I wouldn't call
these results super accurate but a delta
e average of just 2.2 for a neat gamma
curve and a reasonably good white point
are all better than average outcomes
with this sort of panel however colour
performance isn't as great while the
white point is decent there's a bit of a
twist to the saturation response
especially at the maximum blue and red
levels you can also see that the full
red point doesn't reach the very tip of
the srgb spectrum so overall this
display can only cover 96% of srgb
there isn't a horrible result these days
you would expect 99% coverage from
basically any monitor delta-e averages
of 3.44 for saturation and 4.45 for
color checker sure that calibration
really wasn't much of a concern in the
development of this display due to the
slight rotation in saturation
performance there's not much you can do
in the on-screen controls to improve
accuracy with some displays the white
point can dictate accuracy so correcting
that can translate every other point
into its correct accurate position
however the default white point for this
display is good while there's no option
to adjust the hue so your only option to
improve accuracy is a full calibration I
did this using display Cal and you can
download the profiler created from our
patreon page if you are a member the
profile won't be fully accurate for your
unit due to panel variances but it
should improve the situation compared to
how this monitor ships out of the box as
is the case with most calibrations the
results here are very accurate it can't
fix the blue and red primaries so we're
still not getting full srgb coverage but
other than that
a decent outcome and one that only
causes a slight drop in contrast ratio
to about ten fifty to one the final
performance metric to look at is
uniformity the 24 G or 600 F is pretty
good here often with entry level
displays you'll end up with poor
uniformity but at least for the main
central zone this panel holds up well
the outer edges start to see some shift
away from the center but overall I think
this is an above-average result for a
budget monitor overall the LG 24 GL 600
F is a typical entry level gaming
monitor these is a TN panel which gives
it fast response times and a great
refresh rate which LG has then combined
with free sync a low input lag to
deliver a pretty neat gaming experience
however it falls behind in most color
metrics such as viewing angles which are
typically poor for a TN and color gamut
which fails to cover the entire srgb
spectrum it's also not well calibrated
out of the box but this isn't unusual
for a budget gaming focus display so
it's not a huge deal to me the big
issues are those viewing angles and the
gamut and this once again leaves buyers
in a toss-up between TN and an
equivalent VA since both are available
for roughly the same price these days
you have a choice between a flat and
fast TN with wit color performance and a
slower curve VA with superior colors and
a better contrast ratio the sort of
things you want out of a monitor will
dictate which technology is better
suited to your needs although I tend to
find VA s at this price to deliver a
better overall package aside from pure
panel performance the 24 GL 600 F
doesn't do anything special but it's
also not bad in any category the design
is fine the stand is limited but that's
also the case with most other budget
monitors the port selection is typical
and the on screen features match other
brands again this is really your classic
budget display experience because this
monitor doesn't stand out of the pack in
any notable ways I think it's probably a
bit too expensive in the end it's quite
common to find TN displays with the same
specs around the 180 to 200 US dollar
mark such as the acer xf a 240 which
makes the 24 gr 600 F about 30 to 50
dollars too expensive to get an instant
recommendation then you have VA options
like the vo-tech GN 24 C for one hundred
and ninety dollars or in other countries
where the vo-tech isn't available
something like the AOC C 24 j1 again
a lower-cost the 24 GL 600 F isn't a bad
product so if you can find it on sale or
it just is a good price in your region
then yeah go ahead and grab one it's
just not priced competitively right now
which makes it hard to recommend over
some of the other monitors I've been
talking about
I expect the price will filter down a
bit over the next few months so it could
be one to keep an eye on that's it for
this review if you're interested in any
of the monitors I've been talking about
in this video there are links to check
their current prices in the description
below subscribe for more monitor content
because I still have a ton of
interesting new products to get through
I think it's maybe five or six more 100s
to get through I consider supporting us
