today's video we're going to continue
exploring the gaming experience on the
Intel Core i7 8700 5g which is one of
Intel's 65 watt KB rectory variants that
comes equipped with a quad-core CPU and
AMD Radeon Erik's bag and graphics
there's already a full review of this
processor up on the channel and we've
already covered a bunch of games in part
1 of this series so check out both of
those things if you haven't done so
already in today's video I'll be
continuing our exploration of cable 8g
gaming with a look at 13 games including
some titles that you guys requested on
the last video nothing has changed since
last time we'll simply be looking at how
playable these games are on kb like g or
what settings and at what level of
performance every game here has been run
at 1080p resolution and for the most
part I've targeted 60fps
once again I'm testing everything on the
Dell XPS 15 to in one with the core i7
87 o5g and 16 gigabytes of ddr4 2400
memory this is the 65 watt configuration
of KB Lake G with a Radeon rx Vega M GPU
the packs are cut down 20 compute units
in terms of raw power it sits around the
level of the gtx 1050 and gtx 1050 TI so
let's see how it gets on in some more
games overwatch is still a super popular
game and what I'm not particularly good
at in any case if I was good at
overwatch I'd enjoy playing on the 87
o5g at 1080p with medium settings which
are the perfect settings for 100-plus
FPS at most times even in super intense
situations can be like June never did
for high eighty FPS or so and the
experience in general is really smooth
one of the best games in terms of
performance on this processor
far cry 5 is visually beautiful and well
optimized particular and AMD GPUs
despite being a modern title the 87 or
5g was actually able to play this game
on the high preset with frame rates
consistently in the mid 40s it is
possible to achieve 60fps by
significantly reducing the quality
sayings however I think the high pro set
gives a great mix of visual quality and
performance I never saw dips below 30fps
and you can bank on a pretty consistent
45 fps or so throughout the game
civilization six is a game I think is
perfect for playing anywhere and is well
suited to laptops with medium settings
and no anti-aliasing I hit around 35 to
40 fps in the benchmark which is
representative of the late game
experience we're mostly CPU limited here
rather than GPU limited but as it's a
strategy game this sort of performance
is acceptable and perfectly playable so
another tick for KB Lake G
Kingdom Come deliverance is the game
I've personally been playing recently
and it's poorly optimized to say the
least although it can look good at
maximum sayings at times with KB like G
you'll need to play the game on the
lowest possible quality settings though
where you'll get 40 to 60 FPS in the
more populated towns and there can be a
bit of stuttering although that's not
unusual even on high-end gaming pcs the
game suffers visually the low settings
though if you really want to play it the
87 o5g can handle it
I really liked pray when it came out
last year it's another game that can be
played pretty easily on kb lake g with
the high preset delivering mid 40 FPS in
the larger and more graphically
intensive areas of the game you get a
slightly higher frame rate using the
northern preset but i found the game
really playable on high
Rainbow six ages are well-optimized
Ubisoft titled that just runs smoothly
on a wide range of hardware with the 87
or 5g I found the medium preset to be
suitable delivering above 90 FPS in most
situations which is what you want in a
shooter like this you could play at
higher quality presets for better visual
quality but medium is great for the
performance it delivers
watchdogs to is one of the most
intensive titles I tested despite being
released in 2016 using the medium preset
you can get around 40 FPS at 1080p and
that doesn't improve significantly when
you shift it down to the low preset so
there's not much point doing so the game
hammers both the CPU and GPU that
remains playable on the a 705 G
Batman Arkham Knight looks visually
stunning on the 87 o 5gn you can
actually play it on maximum settings
with game works disables and achieve 40
to 60 FPS when playing around the city
in the most intensive areas you will
fall down to around that 40 FPS mark but
in a game that looks amazing on the high
settings you may as well leave it there
because you can
did you really believe that I the
Riddler would fall for such a naked Liam
little charade dirt-poor is a simple
affair you want 60fps for a driving game
and the high preset with CMA aliens get
you there with that preset selected the
game runs really well and if you want to
push the frame rate higher there's
plenty of scope to do so with lower
quality settings or it's six of a crest
don't cap right six
one hand of about 60
right five different caps and reckful
dispensed 100
that's all
and right six into left five right for
long don't cap and right six don't cut
200 200 over bumps 100
next six fallout four isn't well
optimized intends to break quite often
however you guys requested it so here it
is with the medium preset and FXAA set
to low you'll get around 50 to 60 fps in
the most intensive city areas without
any mods installed hopefully fallout 76
is a bit better optimized for modern
hardware when it's released later this
year on for some reason my Game Capture
didn't get audio for this title so while
the footage for fallout 4 is still
playing I'll talk about the one game
that really didn't work on the 87 o5g
and that's Middle Earth shadow of war I
think there's a bug with this game at
the moment that prevents you from
setting a render resolution on KB Lake G
so the game ends up rendering at 5:40 P
which looks horrible it's not a great
game anyway so I guess it's not a big
loss but not everything works fully at
least on this processor one game that
does run well though is csgo at
competitive settings using the lowest
detail levels at 1080p but of course
with multi-core rendering enabled I was
able to get over 100 FPS in most game
situations sometimes well over a hundred
FPS you want to run this game at the
highest possible framerate and cable HP
does a good job of getting there
Mass Effect Andromeda is a game I can't
imagine too many people are still
playing in any case the medium preset
was best for this game delivering 60fps
in the intensive tempest area with
occasional dips down to the 50s you'll
get high frame rates on most planets but
this is the preset that delivers the
best ore and experience
final game for this video is The Witcher
3 one of my all-time favorite games
despite being released in 2015 you won't
be able to run the game particularly
well on KB like Jeep the medium preset
delivered around 40 FPS in the cities
but there was a weird bit of stuttering
present and a fair bit of input lag as
well that made the game unpleasant to
play going with lower quality settings
didn't improve it all that much either
which is a bit disappointing
you look fucking amazing
and that's all the games we've tested on
cable AG in total I looked at 25 games
across the two videos and except for one
game everything was playable on around
medium quality settings some games like
The Witcher 3 and hitman did start it a
bit and have a few issues but others in
particular competitive games like
overwatch fortnight and csgo all ran
really well on the i7 87 o5g that's it
for this one if you have any questions
about Kb like G feel free to chuck them
in the description boy or ask me on our
exclusive patreon discord channel don't
forget to check our other cable HG
content and I'll catch you in the next
one
