Steve here and today I have an update on
the Corsair or 1000d build aka coffee
Ripper now some of you noticed in the
last few videos this system has been in
a few pieces a few things missing I did
pull out the air coolers for the second
gen thread Ripper review because it just
happened to be that that was the time I
started pulling this apart because I got
a heap an absolute heap of aka gear to
jazz this thing up and finally do the
build justice with a whole heap of
liquid cooling gear in short we have
almost 1.4 meters worth of radiators we
have to GPU blocks to CPU blocks to
massive reservoirs as you've probably
noticed and 19 Corsair ml series fans
and that created a whole heap of cable
management challenges let's say because
you have two cables per fan so that was
a whole heap of fun since I don't have
too many days spare or really even a day
spare at the moment due to all the
content that we have coming up I haven't
really been out to throw too much time
sort of in one big heap at this thing so
I've just been doing a bit here and
there and over the last few days I've
got it to this stage so I thought good
time for an update at this point branch
everything is installed now I just have
to do a bit of true bending and get all
that in there and obviously that I'll
finish it off and then I can top it up
with the liquids that I have on hand a
few more hours worth of work there and
I'm probably not going to have time to
complete all that for about a week or at
least a week from now so in the meantime
I have quite a bit to discuss about they
are built to this point so let's go over
that the first thing I told were the
front mount of radios these are the ek
cool stream XE 480 models although they
feature an aluminium and steel housing
they are copper fender radiators with
copper tubing and that makes them quite
heavy at 2.1 kilograms each they also
have a liquid capacity of 450
milliliters so that will add almost
another half kilo in weight not that
weights really any concern for
build anyway installation of the two
front mounted radios was a breeze thanks
to the 1000 DS telescoping radiator
trays though I will speak about those a
bit more later on in this video
this also made installation of the
additional 8 120 millimeter fans quite
easy though simply screwing the fans
into place really was the easy part
dealing with the 32 cables now that was
the real challenge with both radiators
and all 16 120 millimeter fans installed
in the front of the 1000 E the next step
was to install the top mounted radiator
and for that I'm using the ek cool
stream ce4 20 which supports 3 140
millimeter fans and this is where I ran
into my first issue and I suspect it
even before beginning the build that
this may be a challenge basically the
front mounted gear measures 110
millimeters wide in total as this
includes a 60 millimeter thick radiator
and then a pair of fans in a push-pull
configuration this does limit the room
you have in the top of the case to
squeeze in the 420 millimeter radiator
and while it is technically possible it
did come with a compromise at least in
this situation unfortunately I could
only install two of the three fans
installing a third fan would block the
inlet and outlet ports of the front
radiators this is kind of annoying as
coarse as spec sheet and their website
claims you can install up to two 480
millimeter radiators in the front and
then one 420 millimeter radiator in the
top and although they don't specify the
thickness they do show a case with 60
millimeter radiators installed the catch
here being that the demo build uses what
looks to be or really has to be a three
hundred and sixty millimeter radiator
which is odd as the top trays only
support 140 millimeter to 80 millimeter
and 420 millimeter radiators so that is
very misleading
I'm also less of a fan of the
telescoping radiator trays because they
do limit compatibility with radiators in
my opinion they do anyway they sound
awesome in theory but ultimately the end
up being a bit pointless again in my
opinion they just add unnecessary weight
and cost to the case I would have much
preferred they either make this big huge
glass front panel or
which probably presents quite a few
challenges there because it is a big
heavy panel so I can kind of understand
why that is fixed in place alternatively
do something like they did with the 500
D which is just some thin aluminium
sheets that slide out you put all the
stuff on slide and back in very
compatible very light and probably a lot
more cost-effective yeah one of my main
issues with the ball bearing runners
used to slide the trays out and then
back in is they do take up quite a bit
of room you'd probably get a sense of
that looking out here so a more
simplistic design like what we saw in
the 500 d probably would have worked a
bit better without the space required to
fit the runners in I could have slid at
the top radiator back where is it that
one there slid that further back and
then I could have put the third 140
millimeter fan in and it would have
looked a bit better it would have worked
a bit better and the case would be that
much lighter overall and probably that
much more affordable but anyway also one
of my biggest criticisms I suppose of
the trades apart from all the things
that I've just spoke of is that you
can't use the telescoping ability
anymore once you do your cable
management because I don't suppose you
have 30 centimeters of slack cable so
you can slide it back out most of the
fan cable don't even that long to begin
with
so once you've installed all your fan
cables you've done your cable management
they don't slide out anymore and they
sure as hell can't slide out once you're
hard tubing's installed so it's kind of
a one-time deal and I get that it you
slide it out so the fans that are really
far back or a bit easier to install but
honestly of this entire build the
absolute easiest part of the
installation will be installing the
front mounted fans and radiator so I
don't really see the point next up on
the advice of a few patreon members we
ditched the thread ripper 1950s and
replaced it with a 29 50 X and I suppose
why not it's only a very minor upgrade
but it is much easier to make that
upgrade now rather later on once the
build is complete while changing the CPU
I also removed the motherboards of erm
heatsink as I'm installing eks MSI X 399
gaming RGB mono block I was pleased to
find that installing the mono block
is extremely quick and easy just make
sure you install the thermal strip over
the motherboards MOSFET chips and it'll
be happy days once installed I think the
monoblock looks pretty great hopefully
you guys agree I think all I need now is
a little bit more of that Corsair
Vengeance RGB Pro memory and that will
really set this section of the build off
after all it's a pretty extreme build
and it would be just wrong not to
populate all those DIMM slots next up I
quickly threw in the ek supremacy Evo
RGB block on the core i7 8700 K and that
is for the little mini ITX build at the
bottom of the case and this is another
nice-looking block though sadly I don't
think you'll actually get much of a
chance to see it once the builds
complete as it will be hidden behind a
Radeon rx Vegas 64 graphics card
speaking of which my next job was to
install some VGA blocks
starting with Vegas 64 the first job was
to disassemble the reference card which
is a relatively easy process then with
the stock cooler removed you just need
to install the thermal pads on the
massive VRM apply some thermal paste on
the GP on HBM 2 stacks and then finally
screw on the block I'm using the EKF C
Radeon Vega RGB block and I think it
looks pretty impressive since you won't
see the backside of this graphics card
is is forward facing in the 1000 a the
standard backplate back on then for the
thread River portion the build we have
the e K FC geforce gtx efi RGB block and
since i already had a stripped-down 1080
fe car just sitting around doing nothing
this is what i used again the same sort
of deal here is what we just saw with
the vega card though this time you do
have to install the individual thermal
pads on the memory ICS as the 1080 users
gddr5 x-- memory I didn't actually have
the FA backplate handy at the time of
installing the water block so I just
went with the naked PCB which you will
be able to see but I quite like the look
of the bare PCB anyway in my opinion
both graphics cards look absolutely
incredible with the K blocks installed
and I can't wait to see some liquid
flowing through them the last components
I had to install were the pumps and
reservoirs and since I'm using two of
the massive ek or as x3
400 reservoirs which measure 400
millimeters tall and have a huge 820
milliliter capacity I had to remove the
three and a half inch drive cage to make
room to install these behemoths I was
aware of this ahead of time so this
wasn't any kind of surprise or sort of
last-minute work around the cages are
technically non removable as they are
pop riveted into place but since the
build is merely a showpiece and not
something I'm gonna use on a regular
basis there isn't really much need for
anything beyond a few m2 nvme SSDs so
that being the case I would rather just
remove the big three and a half inch
drive cage to make way for bigger more
showy reservoirs drilling out the hard
drive cage was a pretty quick and easy
process though the only technical hiccup
here was that I had to lay the case down
and at this point the case weighed about
35 to 36 kilograms so bit of a daunting
task that one therefore I also took this
opportunity to drill out some holes for
the pumps as they will be mounted in the
bottom of the case for connecting the
pumps to the reservoirs are used an
assortment of EK adapters from their
black nickel range and i think again you
will have to agree they look rather
impressive so that's about where I'm at
now with the build quite a few hours
have gone into it to get to this point
but yeah pretty much everything is
installed now and I am ready for the
hard tubing I think it's fair to say
this is an absolutely ludicrous build
but that's kind of the point and I've
had a heap of fun working with it so far
and I'm personally really pleased with
how it's turning out hopefully you guys
I think it looks pretty cool as well I
think it's one hell of a set piece
hopefully I will have a bit of time like
I said over the next week $2 tube
bending and get the liquid in there and
hopefully no leaks and get it all up and
running but as you're likely aware we do
have some pretty big product releases
over the next few weeks so free time is
even more scarce than usual and that is
gonna do it for this one if you did
enjoy the video well feel free to the
like button for us we much appreciate
that subscribe if you want to see more
content especially more of this build
because like I said over the next week
hopefully I'll have it finished no
promises though and if you appreciate
the work
we do harem oxen consider supporting us
on patreon where you can gain access to
our discord chat and a monthly
livestream and all that good stuff and
as always thank you for watching I'm yo
Steve and I will see you next time I'm
really far away from the camera so your
fault</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
