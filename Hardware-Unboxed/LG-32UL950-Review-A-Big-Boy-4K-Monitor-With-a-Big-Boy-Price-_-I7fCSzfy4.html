checking out a 4k and supposedly HDR
monitor from LG called the 32 euro 950
this beast is mostly marketed towards
creative professionals with LG's website
talking about how good it is for color
grading and other color accurate work
but there's a few features in here as
well for gamers including free sink
support and multiple gaming modes priced
at $1,300 are around 1750 in Australia
the 32 UL 950 probably won't be
attracting too many pure gamers as
that's quite a high price tag to pay for
a 32 inch 4k IPS panel with just a 60
Hertz refresh rate but the feature set
for someone like me that does a lot of
content creation as well is pretty
impressive stuff like 98% DCI p3
coverage multiple factory calibrated
modes and Thunderbolt 3 are all features
I look for in a professional class
monitor and LG has delivered on all of
that here if you saw my earlier review
for the LG 34 wk 95 you which is their
5k ultra wide display for creators a lot
of the design will be familiar to you
the front is dominated by the expansive
31.5 inches per Mille with slimmest
bezels around all four sides
nothing crazy here just a big display
that lets the pixels do the talking the
stand is a silver metal arrangement with
curved legs and a simple pillar so
visually it's all quite pleasing and
should be suitable for office users the
rear of my monitor was white again a
very simple use of plastic here that
gets the job done what you'll also
notice here is a very adjustable stand
we're getting height adjustment with an
excellent range of motion plus tilt and
pivot support this means you can use the
32 year old 950 as a portrait monitor
which I know is popular with some
craters the collection of ports is found
directly on the rear we have DisplayPort
and HDMI plus two Thunderbolt three
ports and two USB type a ports the
inclusion of two Thunderbolt ports
allows for daisy chaining only one of
them is an input but this does allow you
to hook up say two of these monitors
with a single cable and get 60 watts of
power sent back to your laptop
I love monitors that support USB power
delivery and considering lots of
creators rock laptop
as their main machine this is a great
addition on screen controls are
accessible through a directional toggle
although unlike the last Korean monitor
I reviewed from LG the 32 UL 950 does
have a few gaming options in here
specifically a toggle for free sync
which is disabled by default and to game
specific modes always love to see
adaptive sync make the cut but the rest
of the game features aren't all that
useful luckily there are plenty of other
modes and options for adjusting colors
which I feel is the primary use case for
this monitor so let's take a look at
color performance and out of the box
it's all very typical for a wide gamut
monitor the default mode is left fully
unclamped so the entire gamut is
available although 4 srgb content this
means our stretching up to DCI p3 which
results in over saturation so it's
probably not a mode you don't want to
use for standard work or usage due to
this camera issue when testing default
performance against srgb as we always do
Delta e values in our color tests are
around that 3.0 mark so it's not fully
accurate however I was quite impressed
with default grayscale performance the
white point is close to 6500 K as is the
overall CCT curve which leads to a delta
average of 1.4 an excellent result the
gamma ko isn't perfect and needs a bit
of shooting but this is a decent start
most people by this monitor probably
won't use it in the default mode though
and will stick to one of the five
specific color modes that are included
srgb DCI p3 ebu rec 709 and SMPTE - see
I'll be focusing here on the srgb and
DCI p3 modes as they are the most
commonly used although the rec 709 mode
is almost identical to the srgb mode as
well if that's of interest to you
unfortunately the LG 32 UL 950 suffers
from the same issue as its ultra wide
brother the 34 wk 95 you the srgb mode
is very poor this is all down to an
incorrect white point of 5,500 K rather
than 6,500 K which throws off everything
grayscale performance becomes so bad the
error values literally don't fit on my
charts anymore and this flows into
colour Delta II issues with averages of
our 4.0 while the gather is clamped the
mode is not really usable for colour
accurate work and this surprises me a
bit because the monitor ships with a
6500 K
point units default mode so it seems
bizarre to me that LG felt the need to
make any significant changes for the
sRGB mode which uses that very same
white point there is obviously some
fundamental issue being made at the
factory with this mode and that's
disappointing because it's one of the
most important modes available to
creators the issue is compounded by each
of the factory color modes locking down
most settings so you can't just go and
change the white port using your
on-screen menu other features are also
bizarrely disabled I'm not sure why you
can't enable the uniformity compensation
mode or change the response time setting
in any of the calibrated modes both of
these features should be unlocked at the
very least while the srgb mode sucks the
DCI p3 mode is excellent this mode uses
the default white point so we're getting
an accurate 6500 K and that results in a
grayscale Delta II of 1.5 - and
generally good performance here we're
looking at saturation again a great
result with the Delta a average of one
point four four and a similar color
checker result of one point five three
rounds out the bunch it's not perfectly
calibrated but I'd be happy using this
sort of mode for color accurate work so
for those that want a wide gamut monitor
this display will provide great accuracy
with no tweaks and with 97 percent DCI
p3 coverage as measured by myself this
display has the best coverage of that
gamut of any monitor I reviewed up to
this point on top of providing five
color modes out of the box LG also gives
you two slots you can use for hardware
calibrations this is achieved through
LG's true color Pro app which isn't the
best and is especially tricky to use
with this monitor as it requires a USBC
connection but it does end up working as
advertised
basically you hook up the display hook
up a color remodel or similar
calibration device that you own and then
set to work calibrating the display
yourself to any of the supported Gammons
the best part of hardware calibration is
that the profiles are uploaded to the
display and into the provided slots this
means that rather than dealing with PC
science software profiles which often
ignored by applications the display
itself is doing the heavy lifting and
provides accuracy across any app this is
a crucial feature for content creators
and something you typically only see
with professional class displays like
this with two slots available you can
we create 1 srgb profile and one wide
gamut profile to suit whatever work you
are undertaking and with the ability to
create an sRGB profile you can basically
fix the included srgb mode while I
suspect a lot of creators will already
have calibration hardware on hand if
they are serious about color accuracy
unfortunately the hardware to perform
these calibrations is sold separately so
fixing the srgb mode isn't easy or cheap
for those beginning their calibration
journey with this monitor the good news
is from a performance perspective
calibrating the display using true color
Pro works very well grayscale Delta
averages were below 1.0 with a great CCT
curve and both saturation and color
trekker Delta II averages will also boil
1.0 so performance II is accurate and
contrast and doesn't drop significantly
while color accuracy tends to be the
most important performance metric
procurator's there are of course other
things to discuss the brightness is good
topping out 400 nits in the SDR mode
which is probably going to be way too
bright for most users contrast is also
excellent for an IPS LCD at around 1300
to one that's higher than average and
while it is still well below what a VA
panel can provide the far better viewing
angles of IPS panels make this
technology overall better suited to
craters that require accuracy uniformity
is mediocre probably the only key area
where this monitor disappoints along
with the srgb mode you can see here
plenty of Delta e values above two point
notes or full result but it's not as
tight as I'd like for a pro monitor now
this monitor does come with a uniformity
compensation mode but because it's
inaccessible in any of the color modes
or Hardware calibrated modes it's
basically useless and I didn't bother
testing it response times here are
pretty typical for a pro grade IPS at a
greater great average of eight point
zero four milliseconds using the high
overdrive mode which is the mode used
for the color accurate profiles and
can't be changed this puts it in the
ballpark of a gaming grade VA panel so
it's not as quick as the best IPS panels
going around but it's decent enough for
creative work within the 60 Hertz
refresh window input latency is also
fairly standard at around 7 milliseconds
none of these results sound all that
amazing for gamers but I think there's a
bunch of other reasons why you probably
wouldn't want this display for gaming
despite in including features like free
sync
the primary one is the price tag which
is around the same mark as a game in
grade 4k 144 Hertz monitor these days
but also the feature set is generally
geared more towards professionals the
other key feature of this monitor is HDR
thanks to display HDR 600 certification
but performance is very similar to the
LG 34 wk 95 use so I'd still class this
monitor as only a semi HDR display in
other words it gets close to providing a
decent HDR experience but ultimately
falls short as it lacks a full array
local dimming backlight looking at the
HDR checklist here we're meeting the
brightness and color gamut requirements
but with only edge lit local dimming
there can be significant haloing around
bright objects and in general these
types of backlight struggle with HDR
content in some cases having edge lit to
me actually looks worse than having no
dimming at all for HDR content we
typically want at least a 20,000 to 1
contrast ratio but ideally over 50,000
to 1 the 32 UL 950 only manages a twelve
thousand nine hundred to one single
frame ratio in a best-case scenario but
normally this will be way lower and much
closer to the pedals native 1302 1
contrast ratio as there simply aren't
enough local dimming zones the edgelet
array also struggles with small bright
objects so brightness decreases with
smaller window sizes rather than
increases like with a good HDR monitor
sustained brightness only ever reaches
400 nits and actually falls away to 217
it's with a 2% window so you're not
getting good high light performance the
only time I recorded above 600 nits of
brightest was with a full-screen flash
which is good enough to pass display HDR
600 certification but is not ideal for
actually viewing HDR content like with
the 34 wk 95 you the only way to get
true HDR performance with an LCD is to
include a full array local dimming
backlight which adds to the cost of the
monitor given estia and wide government
performance is still great from the 32
year old 950 I think for some buyers
it's safe to ignore the HDR capabilities
all together but if you came here
looking for a top-end
HDR display unfortunately this isn't
going to be in overall there's lots to
like about the LG 32 you online 54
content creators and prefer
it's a really wide gamut monitor it's
big and high-resolution so there's lots
of screen real estate it's accurate to
DCI p3 in the provided mode
it supports hardware calibration the
design is nice it includes Thunderbolt 3
with power delivery and daisy-chaining
viewing angles and contrast are
excellent for an IPS panel and it even
supports free sync the only real
complaints I have are related to
middling uniformity and the poor srgb
mode which really should be calibrated
better I don't think the srgb mode is
too much of an issue for people that
require color accuracy because anyone in
that position should be calibrating the
display themselves anyway but it's just
a bit of an oversight from LG hgr
performance is also mediocre but whether
this is an issue will depend on what you
want to use this monitor for and to me
it succeeds in enough other areas to
only make it a minor problem
I guess the questions at the end of the
day are is this package worth $1,300 and
is it the best option on the market if
you aren't going to find the
professional features useful there are
plenty of great 4k monitors out there
for around $500 that you should choose
instead same advice for gamers either
get a non-professional 4k display for
much less cash or look into a high
refresh 4k monitor like the SR Nitro xB
273 K for around the a thousand dollar
mark for professionals which is the
actual target market here I also think
the 32 UL 950 is a bit hard to recommend
LG has kind of shot themselves in the
foot thanks to their very own 32 UD 99
which offers many of the same features
as the 32 um 950 for a regular price of
$1,000 in fact it's even better than
that because right now the 32 UD 99 is
on sale for just $700 unless you really
really must have say Thunderbolt 3
daisy-chaining or a slightly wider gamut
the 32 UD 99 is a much better deal I
think LG were hoping that hgr would be a
big selling point here as well because
that could further justify the price
difference but given the performance is
only semi HDR at best I just don't think
it's worth it if you need HDR for your
workflow I'd spend more and get
something with true hgr like the soos
pro at PA 32 you see all the dell
ultrasharp up2 7 1x
with that said because the monitor is
actually pretty good overall if the 32
UD 99 gets discontinued or if you can
find the 32 UL 950 on sale or if it's
just a really good price in your country
there are still plenty of reasons to get
it that's it for this monitor review as
