anticipation felt earlier this year when
talking to the guys from AMD about their
upcoming Polaris GPUs the anticipation
only grew as we neared the launch and so
too did the hype
AMD made the announcement in early June
that the RX 4 ad would cost us $200 and
deliver r9 390 light performance this
bit of news had gamers seriously hives
but unfortunately for many this also
created quite a bit of disappointment
once the RX 4 ad landed later in the
month
upon release on the 29th of June it was
discovered that the RX 4 ATS that
everyone reviewed myself included with
the 8 gigabyte models which cost 240
dollars not $200 there was still a 200
dollar model but it was the much less
attractive 4 gigabyte card though as I
later discovered the scenario is where
the aching about our x4 ad is actually
more capable than the 4 gigabyte model a
few and far between
even at 240 dollars - aching about our X
480 represents excellent value sadly
however there have been a few issues
first and foremost has been availability
getting your hands on an 8 gigabyte
model for $240 has been next to
impossible in fact for the most part
finding an RX 480 in stock anywhere has
been a real challenge for most shoppers
for the longest time the early Rx for
ATS we could find were reference models
selling for $300 or more AMD is custom
board partner cards with nowhere to be
found even months after the initial
release finally we're starting to see
custom rx for ATS and availability is
improving unfortunately we aren't yet at
the $240 MSRP but things are slowly
heading in the right direction giving me
my first look at a custom design our X
480 is MSI with a gaming X 8 a team
armed with the latest generation twin
froze our six cooler this new graphics
card looks much like any other high end
GPU from the current MSI lineup this is
a great looking cooler that performs as
good as it looks
although this car will be considerably
cheaper than the msi gtx 1070 gaming x
we looked at a few months ago the cooler
remains much the same in fact there are
X 480 features the exact same cooler
from the GTX 1060 model so it's very
capable there are three heat pipes in
total two of which extend from one end
of the heatsink
the other under the heatsink is a very
large heat spreader that covers much of
the PCB providing cooling for the vrm
circuitry and memory chips something you
might have already noticed is that MSI
is wisely upgraded the six p-m PCIe
power connector of the reference card to
an 8-pin connector this will reduce the
amount of power that has to be drawn
from the PCIe slot and this means the
graphics card is PCI Express compliant
on the backside of the graphics card we
find the same sexy backplate design that
was featured on the GTX 10:17 around at
the connectivity end of the graphics
card we find a DVI port to HDMI ports
and to display ports typically the our X
480 features to display boards so this
means one has been switched to HDMI MSI
has likely done this to make the our X
480 more VR friendly the only other
modifications MSI is made to there are X
480 effect the operating clock speeds by
default the our X 480 operates at up to
1200 66 megahertz we're the memory clock
speed of 2000 megahertz MSI has left the
memory alone but they have pushed the
core clock to 1330 megahertz
a mild 5% factory overclock with a
little tinkering and aimed is what man
were able to boost the core by another
30 megahertz to one thousand three
hundred and sixty megahertz which is a
pretty meager 2% overclock
meanwhile the gddr5 memory hit the
ceiling at 2250 megahertz a more
impressive 13 percent overclock so with
all that cleared up let's get into the
benchmarks first up we have the witcher
3 and here the msi our X 480 was 5
percent faster than the AMD reference
card this place had alongside the gtx
1060 found Edition with an average of 44
fps this time in Far Cry we see a 7
percent increase in performance favoring
the msi card over AMD's reference model
as a result the gaming X was just a
single frame slower than the 1060
founder's addition the msi RX 4 ad
managed to deliver an 8% boost over the
reference card in star wars battlefront
making it just 2 FPS slower than the GTX
1016 for whatever reason the division
was a game where my AMD reference card
really struggled falling 3 FPS behind
the eye 9 390 I suspect throttling was
the issue here anyway the msi RX 4 ad
was a massive 17 percent faster than the
reference card placing at 2 FPS ahead of
the gtx 1060 and r9 390
the msi RX 480 was the more typical 7%
faster in Mirror's Edge catalyst when
compared to the AMD reference card just
put it on par with the r9 390 in just a
single frame behind the stock gtx 1060
efi graphics card overwatch is another
game where my reference RX 4 ad was
seemingly underperforming our 8 messiah
card on the other hand provided 18% more
performance averaging 79 FPS though this
meant it was still 7% slower than the
fans Edition 1016 MSI obviously feeding
there are X 480 gave me X model a lot
more powers the total system power
consumption increased by 12% this took
the system consumption to 282 once which
is similar to what we saw from the r9
390 and nano graphics cards despite
consuming more power the msi R X 480 ran
10 degrees cooler than the reference
card given the power consumption I feel
this is an excellent operating
temperature for MSI's our X 480
unfortunately when it came time to
overclock this card we didn't have much
luck the core was increased by 30
megahertz a 2% overclock in the memory
by 250 megahertz a 13% overclock this
netted us 4% more performance in
overwatch which hardly seems worth the
trouble it feels like I've been waiting
so long but I'm happy to have finally
tested a high quality board partner
design Rx for Eddy the gaming x HD model
does a good job of showing the RX 418
the best light possible something aimed
his own reference card didn't exactly do
from day one I've said the AMD our x 480
reference card is pretty rubbish and
this just proves it the tiny heat scene
coupled with the inadequate 6 pin power
input seem to provide inconsistent
results in quite a few titles having
found such strong performance in the
division and overwatch with the MSI card
I went back and retest of my reference
card only to find the same lackluster
performance the reference our X 480 was
throttling in these titles but not to
the degree that would explain such a
massive performance deficit between
itself and the MSI card perhaps this has
something to do with the power target or
there could simply just be an issue with
my card either way I was very pleased
with the performance the MSI our X 480
delivered and this has prompted me to
put together in higher X 480 vs. GTX
1060 board partner card comparison
expect a notification for that video
when you're in bot
shortly overall the MSI rx4 ad gaming
xhg is an excellent mid-range graphics
card that delivers solid performance
across the board thanks to the beefy
Twin Frozr six cooler it also looks very
high-end while also running cool and
quiet
the only issue for now and it's a rather
large one is the inflated price of
course pour our X 480 pricing isn't
limited to MSI but the gaming x 8g is
one of the pricier examples right now
over in the States it costs three
hundred and forty US and here in
Australia you can expect to pay at least
four hundred and twenty s so not great
given the $240 US MSRP still I expect
pricing the self-correct shortly or
rather I hope it will what do you guys
think of the gaming x8 G let me know in
the comments
