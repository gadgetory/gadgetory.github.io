welcome to the first video from my new
house those that have been following the
channel particularly closely in the past
few weeks you'll have heard about how I
was moving things slowly disappearing
from the set behind me and now
everything is gone because I've just
rebuilt the wall in the new place and
you'll see some shelves and other
interesting things go back up there in
the coming weeks bit of a project so if
you are interested there are some behind
the scenes video is available for our
patrons on that whole process the audio
in here at the moment as well isn't
particularly great it is a little bit
echoey I still have to put up some
acoustic foam all around the other side
of the set area so they'll be happening
in the coming weeks as well hopefully
we'll be able to improve the sound
quality a little bit and bring it back
to where it was at the previous place so
yeah a bit still to do on the audio
front hopefully it's not too bad we'll
do some things in post hopefully make it
not as bad as it sounds in here at the
moment and yeah that should be coming up
nicely in the next couple of weeks
anyway this video isn't about moving
house it's about a particularly
interesting monitor that asus sent over
the Nitro XV 273k this is a gaming
monitor that many of you have been
requesting that I review in particular
one of our patreon members who made sure
I was following this up with us every
few weeks anyway after months of waiting
the XV 273k landed on my doorstep and
I've been able to put it through its
paces this monitor is particularly
interesting because it's the first to
bring a 4k resolution and 144 Hertz
refresh rate to gamers and a more
affordable price point than existing
offerings
you might remember my reviews of the ASA
Predator X 27 and the SUSE rog swift PG
27 you - those were the first monitors
ever to pack this combination of a high
resolution and high refresh rate but
because they also included proper HDR
support and gsync ultimate they were
priced well out of range of many buyers
at around that $2,000 mark but the XV
273k is much cheaper often retailing for
around $900 I wouldn't call this super
affordable by any means but at half the
cost of the original high refresh 4k
monitors it could be tempting to some
high-end buyers of course with any
cheaper product some features have been
cut to bring the price down the bigger
mission here is the FAL Dior full-array
local dimming backlight that was found
in the predator x27
the FAL D backlight is important because
it brings proper HDR to the table so if
that featured card from the XV 273k
we're no longer getting true HDR
capabilities it is still display HDR 400
certified but that validation stamp is
pretty much meaningless G's Inc has also
been cut in favor of free sync but now
that in video also supports free sync
that's no longer a really big deal and
as expected
adaptive sync worked fine with my NVIDIA
GPU in fact this monitor is G sync
compatible so the Nvidia control panel
automatically detects it as an adaptive
sync monitor and applies the appropriate
settings for you
ASA has given this monitor a definite
gamer aesthetic but they haven't gone
overboard The Stand uses silver metal
prongs and there's a bit of flair to the
base with a red highlight but otherwise
we're getting a standard black plastic
construction it's not a particularly
slim monitor it's perhaps slightly
thinner than the ex 27 as there's no F
alt backlight but you'll mostly be
viewing it from the front where the
bezels are moderate if a little larger
than normal as for other elements we get
a little bit of RGB LED action along the
bottom edge but it thankfully it can be
disabled the stand is height to tilt and
swivel adjustable but there's no pivot
motion so you can't use it in a portrait
orientation overall the stand is very
sturdy so that's great to see there's
also no active cooling fans that the
monitor is silent unlike the two chasing
ultimate monitors I mentioned earlier
for ports there's two HDMI ports and two
display ports plus some classic USB hub
action the monitor requires an external
power brick as well then for the
on-screen menu we do get a directional
toggle so that's a tick in my book plus
a few shortcut buttons unfortunately the
OSD is quite sluggish to navigate the
performance here is surprisingly poor
which isn't something I often find about
these menus where you will find in the
menu though are some neat features
including a black frame insertion mode
for increased clarity I personally never
use this mode but I know some people do
find it useful there's also a low blue
light mode a mode that uses the ambient
light sensor to automatically adjust
settings a few cheat crosshairs and some
other typical stuff ace has a pretty
good feature set here moving into the
performance section there are a few
refresh rate oddity
I want to talk about first while this
panel is capable of a 144 Hertz refresh
rate enabling it is hidden away in the
on-screen menu on top of that to use the
mode you'll need to run dual DisplayPort
cables which introduces its own set of
compatibility challenges but worst of
all is the fact that enabling the 144
Hertz refresh rate disables freezing not
an ideal situation for gamers that
benefit greatly from adaptive sync with
such a high resolution there are some
workarounds the buyers have discovered
but they are pretty complicated and to
be honest the difference between 120 and
144 Hertz isn't large enough to warrant
the effort it is a bit annoying that a
product marketed as supporting 144 Hertz
is either compromised at that refresh
rate or requires a lot of effort to get
working properly but at least it's quite
easy to get 120 Hertz working through a
single cable with all of that said I can
understand what Acer has tried to do
here by supporting 144 Hertz through
dual DisplayPort rather than a single
cable like with the predator X 27 the
monitor is capable of running at that
refresh rate with 10-bit color for HDR
without chroma subsampling so if you
want to run at that refresh the image is
clearer than with the equivalent juicing
ultimate displays I'll be it without
adaptive sync in most cases
unfortunately you will be stuck with
chroma subsampling if you want to run at
a 120 Hertz refresh rate over a single
cable and use HDR at the same time the
SDR mode is fine but for HDR viewing
over a single cable with native RGB
you'll need to drop down to just 60
Hertz as there's no optimal 98 Hertz
mode that makes the most use of display
ports bandwidth so there's another minor
annoyance we're taking into account all
of this refresh rate and cable talk my
recommendation is simply to run at 120
Hertz in the SDR mode over a single
DisplayPort cable it's nice and simple
you retain adaptive sync the difference
between 120 or 144 Hertz is small and
this monitors HDR mode really isn't good
enough to bother using it and fluffing
around with chroma subsampling the other
reason to stick to 120 Hertz is in the
response times the monitor comes with to
overdrive modes normal and extreme
however the extreme mode introduces
overshoot with many transitions I
recommend using normal mode as a result
but with a greater great average
response time of 7.5 to milliseconds in
this mode the display is effectively
being Borel nectar around 120 Hertz
which means
there isn't much to be gained from
jumping up to 144 Hertz anyway
this response time result also puts the
X V 273 K below both the asou speech in
U Q and ASA X 27 in the charts despite
having similar panels the seuss model
still leads here with the best overdrive
optimization I wouldn't say the X V 273
K is bad by any stretch and it's fine
for 120 Hertz but at the same time it's
really nothing special on the other hand
input latency is great at around 3
milliseconds of lag which is an ideal
result for a gaming monitor alright
let's move on to some brightness and
contrast numbers in the SDR mode we're
getting around 413 it's peak which is
more than enough for most viewers and
when combined with great viewing angles
particularly in the horizontal plane
this is a highly viewable monitor as for
contrast yeah it's typical for an IPS at
around that one thousand two one mark
you aren't going to get VA like numbers
here but it's still decent enough for
gaming monitors I tend to treat color
accuracy as a nice bonus but considering
this display is nearing that $1000 mark
it's probably a bit more important than
usual luckily Acer does provide a sheet
claiming factory calibration to adults a
average of less than one point oh and
the monitor comes with a number of color
modes for popular gamuts like srgb rec
709 and DC I will just quickly run
through the default out-of-the-box
performance here nothing amazing and I
don't imagine too many people will run
the monitor in this mode as expected the
camera is fully unclamped so we're
getting the entire 91% days who I pay
through coverage this monitor is capable
of even four srgb content which does
mean over saturation there's also an
incorrect white point and generally
Delta averages are above 4.0 which
really is not accurate for srgb work
switching to the srgb mode and things do
improve but perhaps not to the level I
would have liked like with the default
mode the monitors still has a slight red
tint to grays which is noticeable when
putting the monitor next to properly
calibrated displays this behavior was a
little unusual given the supposed
factory calibration and it isn't quite
close enough to the ideal white point to
get my tick of approval grayscale Delta
averages asked you around that 4.0 mark
as a result however with our saturation
testing you can quite clearly see the
gamut is fully clamped srgb which is
good for most content you'll be viewing
Delta a averages for some colors are
better
than others but it evens out to around
2.5 not perfect not the one point of a
so claims but for gamers I think this
result is close enough and this carries
through to the colorchecker tests which
are pretty similar it's a similar story
for the DCI mode so I'm not going to
talk about that in detail but if you do
need a wide gamut mode it is one to
consider
unfortunately fixing the incorrect white
point does require a software profile if
you find that your monitor is tinted
slightly red it might be worth checking
out the profile I generated for my
review unit which is available on our
patreon feed due to panel variants I
don't think every monitor will ship with
a red tint so it may not help out in
your specific situation when calibrated
using display Cal you can see the
results here which as always are quite
good with Delta averages around the 1.0
mark this combination of the srgb mode
and the software profile would be fine
for creatives especially as the monitor
uses IPS technology with great viewing
angles and decent wide gamut performance
I'll touch quickly on uniformity here
nothing amazing nothing overly poor a
typical result for a gaming grade
monitor the results I got from the Acer
predator X 27 in uniformity and color
performance in general are better than
what this panel provides perhaps there's
a higher level of factory calibration
occurring therefore what is a $2,000
display HDR really isn't worth touching
on in any great detail because we're
looking at another fake HDR display with
only display HDR 400 certification the
XV 273k fails two of the three key
metrics for good HDR performance namely
brightness is too low as it fails to hit
600 and its peak and there's no local
dimming so the contrast ratio stays
fixed at around 1000 to 1 which is far
too low for HDR content I wouldn't buy
this monitor for HDR and I wouldn't
bother using the mode altogether
all up this is one of those monitors
that's in a unique position because
there isn't a lot like it on the market
sure you have those super expensive
g-sync HDR panels that cost two thousand
dollars but if you don't care about HDR
and just want a high refresh 4k monitor
it's basically the XV 273k it's g-sync
brother the xB 273 K that's essentially
the same and costs a little more or well
nothing if high refresh 4k is what you
want the XV 273 K is definitely the
monitor you should
yet I really don't think proper HD is
worth spending an additional $750 on
going on current market prices
considering this display is a relatively
cheap $900 and offers nearly every other
feature that the predator x27 offers it
is much better value and I'm not saying
that just because this is the only
monitor available with these specs in a
number of areas ASA is providing a great
high-end gaming experience the build
quality is great the IPS panel puts up
respectable performance numbers
including a true 120 Hertz refresh rate
the included srgb mode is great for
standard gaming and you get wide gamut
support on top of that plus it supports
free sync and comes Jacek compatible
certified it's not perfect though my
main concerns still surrounds that
top-end 144 Hertz refresh rate which
isn't as usable as I'd like
I think 120 Hertz is going to be plenty
high enough for buyers and that refresh
rate still delivers a great fluid
experience but it is advertised as 144
Hertz so that mode should be a bit
better in my opinion the other
complaints I had were less important
like the slow on-screen menu and a few
inconsistencies with the calibration
plus a worthless HDR mode well I would
recommend the XV 273k for people who
want a high refresh ball came on it up
right now I still think we're in the
early adopter phase for these sorts of
monitors the issue is getting that 144
Hertz motor work well are largely
technical limitations that should be
solved with future iterations and I also
expect the price to trickle down over
time $900 is still a lot to spend on a
monitor particularly when high refresh
1440p is available at less than half the
price and for most gamers in my opinion
is still a better choice that's it for
