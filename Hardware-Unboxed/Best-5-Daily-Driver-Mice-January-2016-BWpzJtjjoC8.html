hardware on box top five today I'm going
to be ranking what I believe to be the
best five available daily driver Myers
that can also be used for gaming on the
market in January 2016 I really believe
the mouse is so crucial to the overall
computing experience and it really has a
significant effect on both productivity
and gaming performance especially for a
long time I really wasn't picky with the
mouse that I use and I remember the
feeling of disbelief as I witnessed
people paying a hundred dollars for a
razor boom slaying back in the day a lot
has changed since 1998 and now today's
my eye patch with so many more features
and options that your peripheral
decision has become a very important one
that important decision has come harder
than ever there are so many companies
entering the peripheral pointing device
game and with some companies bringing
our multiple products per year it's
almost overwhelming the don't fret I've
sifted through the best of the best and
today i bring in my top five mice for
january 2016 the g.skill ripjaws MX 780
RGB might be a surprising entry into our
top five Mouse roundup but i feel it's
an inclusion that's well deserved better
known for its excellent value memory
products g.skill isn't a company's think
I've been talking about pc peripherals
last year they aim to change that with
the introduction of the awesome value MK
780 mechanical keyboard and the
aggressive looking MX 780 gaming mouse
as far as I can tell the foundation of
the MX 780 has been copied over from the
popular cougar 700m a mouse that has
very strong user reviews on amazon and
newegg while it was also praised by
professionals the MX 780 builds upon
cougar 700m and delivers what we feel is
a better quality mouse with more useful
features the switches are guaranteed for
an insane 20 million clicks so you
should wear our more than a few mouse
pads and possibly even desks on the way
the 32 bit erm processor provides
virtually instantaneous responses and
512 kilobytes onboard storage allows
gamers to save up to three profiles
directly to the mouse aesthetically the
MX 780i gb is an aggressive-looking
mouse that feels as good as it looks
many of you especially the left is we
pleased to know that the
ambidextrous mouths however it goes one
better by including interchangeable side
groups so left-handed users can move
that really nice thumb rest over to the
right side of the mouse another great
feature is the height adjustable
palmrest customizations don't stop there
g.skill has included a weight system
that lets you place a four and a half
gram weight in each side of the mouse a
highly removable side grips which is a
really nice touch all of this can behave
for the bargain-basement price of just
$55 DMX 780 isn't just an impressive
feature list either the mouse was really
nice and is extremely accurate I've had
my promise for months now and in that
time seen quite a lot of use yeah it
still looks much like the day I got it
this has to be one of the most
underrated minds of 2015 the rocket
cover comes in at number four on our
list and like the g.skill MX 780 it to
is an ambidextrous mouse rocket and now
well known for their excellent high
quality peripherals the 2015 release
Cobras no exception with smooth plastics
all around the design combines rounded
and tapered off edges with harder
sharper cuts for somewhat unusual but
very cool appearance at the front of the
mouse the extra fingertip buttons shut
out like wings the front to me looks
almost Lamborghini inspired titled smart
cast by rocket the button layout is
really really cool on the khobar as
mentioned either side of the stand left
and right mouse button the two
additional buttons that are conveniently
reached by your fingertips as a
right-hander I personally found the left
one a lot more intuitive to reach and
use this one a lot more than the one on
the right side both sides of the mouse
also feature back and forward buttons
too and this symmetrical layout is what
makes the covert really ambidextrous the
cova also employs easy shift plus which
enables a second set of commands for all
of your mouse buttons if you wish these
kind of course all be customized in the
Rockets warm software to the Cobras also
lit up at the rear base and in the
scroll wheel by RGB lighting which kind
of course be customized to your heart's
desire in the swarm software also
despite being an ambidextrous mouse the
fifty-dollar Cobra is still very
comfortable to use and it's a ray of
cool buttons features and impeccable
performance bring it to spot number four
in our top five coming in at number
three is the my onyx caster if something
that's just so damn nice about this
piece of hardware from the Swedish
company it's almost hard to explain
first glance that honestly looks pretty
basic but once you use it for a few
minutes the amazing attention to detail
becomes apparent as soon as you put this
mouse in your hand it just feels so
premium and comfortable it's Charles
entirely plastic but it's wrapped in
four layers of just exquisite feeling
rubber and its overall quite small and
light coming in at 94 grams the other
side of the mouse is shaved with two
groups your ring and pinky finger and
for me they feel like the perfect shape
the caster isn't laced with fancy
buttons in fact demonics have kept it
quite simple in this regard on the left
side you'll find just the forward and
back buttons which were me a position
perfectly and give really satisfying
tactile feedback the rider left mouse
buttons are sharper quieter and less
hollow sounding than the g502 for
instance and again feel just great under
the finger the scroll wheel rotates
softly and Dolph thuds give you feedback
as you roll over not by notch
unfortunately there's no free spin mode
however the underside has two large
Teflon slip max that allow the mouse who
truly glide across mouse pads and other
surfaces as smoothly as any other gaming
mouse in the market now pmw 3310 gaming
grade sensor will never miss a dot per
inch there's zero hardware acceleration
and the sensor can be configured all the
way up to 10,000 dpi everything can be
customized in minuses included software
all six buttons can be configured to any
function you desire and you can switch
between three dpi levels on the fly by
default you can customize the igb
lighting as you please and you can even
toy with things such as the liftoff
distance and adjust the XY axis overall
the seventy dollar mionix caster is a
truly fantastic gaming mouse it's a
delight to use as your daily driver uses
the prefer mouse littered with buttons
we left longing for more the majority of
users and players simply use the
standard buttons were you absolutely
wrapped with this fantastic entry for my
onyx at number two I've got none other
than the logitech g502 proteus spectrum
there are so many reasons why i love
this mouse but the main one is just
simply the shape it's quite a small
mouse over all my hands aren't tiny but
it just seems to sit in there so well i
think a large part of the reason is the
sizeable thumb rest that allows my thumb
to completely relax simply come along
for the ride between clicks how
luxurious the g farmer 2 is just packed
with buttons to equipped with no less
than 11
left and right clicks field grade along
with a fantastic tactile scroll wheel
which can also be toggled between step 2
free spinning mode which I love by an
additional 12 key the will also acts as
a middle click button and can also be
pressed to either side for side
scrolling there are three buttons
accessed by the thumb consisting of the
essential back and forward browsing
buttons plus a third sniper or dpi shift
button allows you to shift the DPI
usually to a significantly slower
tracking speed up top there are two more
buttons accessed by the index finger
next to the left click button by default
they'll move the DPI up and down on the
go and the g502 is able to go up to a
ridiculous 12,000 dpi finally there's a
single button behind the scroll wheel
which by default will allow you to
switch between profiles and the logitech
gaming software this brings me to the
customization of the mouse using
Logitech's proving gaming software
you're able to configure any of these
buttons apart from the mechanical switch
between stepped and free spins to
absolutely anything you desire you can
then of course save multiple profiles
with different games for example to be
honest I don't really mess around the
adjustable weights in mice much at all
is whatever is in there i usually get
used to pretty quickly however the
Proteas spectrum allows you to choose
not only how much weight to add but also
where you add it behind a magnetic door
on the underside of the mouse and just
when you thought load you take a thought
of everything with a g502 there's one
more trick up its sleeve can optimize
the mouse of sensor to a particular
surface by using the surface test
function just to make sure you're
getting the most out of every one of
those 12,000 dots per inch not really
though because at 12,000 dpi the
sensitivity is just off the charts but
you get what I'm saying with an amazing
combination of comfort and ergonomics a
wealth of buttons great customization
and all around awesomeness the logitech
g502 proteus spectrum is great to use in
windows for video and photo editing and
of course is a beast for gaming as such
it comes in at number two in our top
five daily driver meijer for January
2016 claiming the top spot in our
Hardware on box top five daily driver
mice for January 2016 is drumroll the
Logitech MX
Master first off this thing looks
amazing if I was going to design a mouse
this might be what it looks like but
it's not just looks that logitech a
focus on with the design of the MX
master this thing fits and feels amazing
in the hand I've decided I'm a big fan
of the thumb cradle and the MX master
boasts one of the best ones around it's
textured triangle patterns look great
and its contours and surfers feel so
nice and smooth on the thumb too i think
the shape of the mouse really suits a
palm grip Merce but it's comfortable no
matter what group you use on top of this
the cradle is actually a button under
your thumb too and you can click this in
and swipe the mouse around to use it as
a gesture pad which is especially great
for Windows 10 as far as connectivity
goes this mouse is elite does come with
a standard tiny logitech USB dongle for
standard wild connectivity which weren't
great as you'd expect the bluetooth 4.0
connectivity is what sets this mouse
apart on the bottom of the mouse is a
small button that toggles between
backlit one two and three numbers is
indicate which of the mouse's inbuilt
memory profiles you've selected allowing
you to switch between devices you
connected to on the fly this is
particularly useful when you have a set
up with multiple computers tablets or
other devices in the same room but don't
have a bunch of different marks laying
around emx master is the little bigger
and a little heavy and some of the other
entries on our list which isn't too
surprising as it's wireless and has a
battery in there the battery is
unfortunately not removable but it does
last a long time and can be charged
using a standard microUSB cable i
personally prefer this over any other
connection as virtually everyone has one
lying around so it's very hard to get
stuck with no battery no matter where
you are the MX master also brings back
the side scroll wheel and I'm a big fan
of it I think this could be really
useful for anyone but for those of you
to partake in significant amounts of
video editing you need this thing in
your life the regular scroll wheel is
great too it features Logitech's
legendary free spin mode which doesn't
need a switch to activate instead when
you scroll at a certain speed it will
stop clicking and into free spin and you
can even customize at what point this
occurs in logitech software pretty
amazing the battery lasts weeks it feels
great in games it looks dope every
feature is well thought out and
impressive this mess of the whole
package and that's why the Logitech MX
master is my personal choice as a daily
driver and number one on the hardware
box top 5 thanks
