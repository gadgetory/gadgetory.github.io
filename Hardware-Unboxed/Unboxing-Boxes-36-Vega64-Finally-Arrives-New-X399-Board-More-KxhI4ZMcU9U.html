episode of things in boxes getting taken
out of boxes and shown to you on camera
that seems far too descriptive I we've
settled on a name we've done other heap
of times now anyway it's the series that
inspires so many young kids to become
tech youtubers so I'm just wondering do
you get to keep all the hardware and how
do you ask companies for it do they just
send it out I think I'll start a YouTube
channel too because I want free stuff
well Little Billy it's really quite
simple
start by reviewing the computer hardware
you already have maybe get some gear
from your friends and review that as
well
create some guides or tutorials based on
that gear then after that invest about
10,000 ish dollars on extra hardware
camera gear lighting and so on then
spend about say one or two years working
basically for free grinding away
creating a video at least every other
day and then you'll probably have put
yourself in a position to receive some
cool free hardware though be aware
nothing is really free the hardware will
have to be reviewed so there'll be more
work and you will have to generate some
kind of exposure for said hardware or
the manufacturers simply won't send it
gotcha
I'm just kidding start a YouTube channel
with some dumb name like harbor and box
fire off a few emails and voila
let's get unboxing right so I think
first up we'll get rid of this big case
box
I'll just put all our side there so we
don't knock anything off because I
haven't got that much desk space and
you're not a huge mystery as to what we
have here it's a rather large or really
a typical sized ATX standard ATX mid
tower sized box but it is from
Silverstone and this is their premier PM
0-1 and it is the RGB version it looks
like we've got I know there's a few
different versions here so I don't know
if it says on the box which one we've
got out and off all the boxes the same
they probably are but there's one with a
cool kind of looks like a unicorn clap
tight design I don't know what we have
here doesn't seem to say on the box so
at least some of this or this portion of
the unboxing boxes will be a surprise
are you ready here we go and it's upside
down but it's around the right way kind
of so it's not a complete fail well it
is black and it looks like it's probably
the matte black version all right the
final unveiling are you ready
I know you are here we go all right
hopefully this is framed okay on camera
if not I'll check out some b-roll anyway
we've got double plastic er not one way
out
well now we've got one layout can you
tell it's very cold in Melbourne today
okay
it's off always one so as you guys can
probably tell this has a tempered glass
side panel and it is got quite our quite
a heavy tint on it so you can't doesn't
shop the mess inside the case at things
like RGB lighting of course that will
shine through quite nicely and yeah
basically the stuff you want to
highlight will look good so it looks
like we do have more more flashes before
okay I won't need to go to Jemma today
because you know i go to i go to gyms
all right so impressive thick tinted
panel and we've got a black strip at the
bottom which hides sort of the mess at
the bottom of the case I think it's also
so the RGB looks like we've got like a
built-in light strip here sort of makes
that effect a bit more impressive I'm
going to sit this over here hopefully I
don't smash it let's have a look what
we've got here so I suppose I should
tell you how much the case costs before
we get too far into it okay so there are
basically two models of this case
there's the higher-end RGB version which
I have and that is I believe it's about
a hundred and thirty US or a hundred
eighty dollars Australian and then you
can get a non RGB model which comes with
fixed colour lights I believe it's
either red LEDs or blue LEDs depending
on the color you get and that's a bit
more affordable with 110 dollars u.s. or
I think it might be 160 Australian could
be wrong on those pricing but somewhere
around there so it's not super expensive
but not cheap either so I believe what I
have here is the matte black verge
virgin version RGB white so now you can
set the lighting to whatever color you
want so it could be quite a colorful
affair but it will also come in a
titanium color so I believe that some
sort of grayish color and then of course
white so yeah and then alternately you
can get it in a gloss black I believe or
it's a black that's not a matte black so
pre-installed upfront we find four no
sorry three 140 millimeter RGB fans with
a looks like a 140 just a standard sort
of fan in the back having a look here
I'll chalk up some b-roll and there's a
cool built-in RGB sort of white strip
along the bottom here that's not
something you often see in cases so
that's pretty cool it's very custom and
then you've got a basement section here
for the PSU and all the table
a couple of table grommet holes here and
there and I imagine the whole back
sections opened up there is quite a lot
going on around the vacuum let me try
and work out and explain what we have so
it looks like we have a fan hub here so
we've got three fans already plugged
into the fan hub so you can put five
more into there so it doesn't looks like
it's eight and total a couple of velcro
cable ties spots here so that's cool
we're starting to see them used quite
commonly then it looks like this is
probably an RGB controller yeah no look
that is an RGB controller there so
there's a switch here to turn the RGB
lights on and off and I believe this can
then be hooked into your motherboard so
if you have like aura lighting or you
know the the asrock RGB lighting stuff
or MSI's mystic lighting that could hook
into that and then using your
motherboard through the software you can
control the fans RGB lighting as well as
the strip so you'll see we've got at
least the three fans and the front
hooked into it and we have the is there
an RGB strip in the top yeah so there's
an RGB strip preinstalled customer Demi
strip in the bottom and the top so that
it's going to give an amazing lighting
effect especially behind that tinted
glass window and they both plug into
here as well and it looks like it's
possible to plug at least two more RGB
type devices into that it is powered by
a SATA power cable that's the fan the
fan control the fan hub so start a power
cable we'll Parador and that is awesome
to see I hate us when there's four pin
molex connectors so yeah start a power
awesome and then off this fan hub it can
be PWM controlled via the motherboard
there's a four pin fan header which will
go to the motherboards that can control
the whole hub so that's pretty cool so
yeah it's looking like sort of money
it's very well equipped a lot of really
nice features
and the LED light strips are really
impressive I'm actually a lot of
planning on doing a build in this but
it's really cool so we might have to do
something like that in the near future
something unique about the RGB stuff
with this case is the fact that they
have got these really cool-looking fan
grilles and now what is RGB lit on this
case so the fans behind them are clear
so the RGB all the light emitted from
them will go through the fan and give
you that cool RGB family yeah they're
something a bit different there's quite
a few different things about this case
Silversun are definitely trying to sort
of set their cases out from the sea of
RGB tempered glass cases how exist on
the market all right big case out of the
way time to get into a few more of these
smaller more manageable boxes we'll
start with this one from as rock because
as rock always sort of serve up some
very cool and exciting products most
likely motherboards but you never know
okay there's a FedEx box which feels
like it has another box in it so we are
actually unboxing boxes to be unboxed on
this episode of unboxing boxes as
advertised oh well we have a very cool
box here yep got one of them I've still
got the gigabyte x-29 or is gaining nine
sitting down here in the box have
another chance to look at that yet got
to clear a few things have getting to be
out of hand so we'll take a look at the
x3 99 fatality gaming board in a minute
we have another board here I think you
know another box now
well they're both AMD motherboards but
they could not be more opposite ends of
the motherboards spectrum all right we
have a little a320 m-pro for and that is
obviously designed mostly take advantage
of the new Verizon 3 CPUs the r3 1200
and 1300 X and that will definitely be
priced under $100 u.s. so we'll check
that in a second and then we have this
guy in a bit of tape all right I daresay
most of you are probably wanting to have
a quick look at this board so we'll do
that I won't spend too long on it if we
did just look at the Tai Chi board which
is sitting right there as a matter of
fact and I know this board is very
similar themed slightly differently so I
won't even bother taking me out of the
foam I'll chuck up some b-roll of it so
you guys can get a better look so in
terms of features this is pretty much
what we've seen from the Tai Chi is
essentially the exact same board like I
says just seemed a bit different you
look a bit differently the main things
to my knowledge that they've changed or
rather added is it now has creative
Sound Blaster cinema 3 audio support so
you get the creative software and let's
do a few fancy audio related things and
probably one of the bigger upgrades
especially if you're doing like a
workstation build or something which is
a little ironic since this is the gaming
version and this really isn't a gaming
feature is 10 Gigabit Ethernet
definitely more of a workstation
productivity PC type thing than gaming
and you also still keep the two Intel do
you give it network controllers as well
with this board so there'll be three
rj45 connectors on the i/o panel but
yeah I mean it's a bit silly putting
gaming in the word for NEX 399 board but
I get why they do it because they'll no
doubt they still many gamers with deep
pockets looking for a cool
motherboard and yet this is a very cool
one so anyway you get all the other
stuff to three ultra m2 ports before PCI
Express times 16 slot so it looks like
again the second and fourth slot are
only wide four eight times bandwidth
eight SATA port so you got to eight
games of course take advantage of the
quad channel memory 11 phase vrm and
because this does have the 10 Gigabit
Ethernet solution and the suppose the
slightly better audio it is around $100
more than the Taichi I think this board
is for 40 US and you're paying about 340
us for the tyshee that works out to be
about 694 this board in Australia or 564
taichi so yeah basically if you want 10
times the internet internet 10 times the
network throughput over the Taichi then
you want this it is cheaper than buying
a standalone 10 Gigabit Ethernet
expansion card so yeah anyway no doubt a
very cool board and I'll be featuring
that on the channel soon in a few videos
on to the little guy so I have looked up
the price of this board and I obviously
haven't tested it or even used it yet I
just took out of the box just a second
ago but I already sort of have mixed
feelings about it
and the reason for that is because I
don't really like the a320 boards to
begin with because I am a PC enthuses
like many of you and I do like to do
things like overclock and that's why I
like the r3 1200 because it's 20 dollars
cheaper than 1300 X you can save 20
bucks overclock it to at least to 1300 X
level of refinement generally quite a
bit more and you can do that at all no
additional costs while saving $20 with
this board the 3900 X possibly makes
more sense that I'll have to do that
testing it's at least similar in terms
of value this is about the only reason
why you would buy a 1300 export is if
you bought a cheaper a320 that you
couldn't overclock with so you wanted to
get the extra performance by getting
these
CPU with the higher clock multiplier out
of the box the issue is you can buy be
350 boards starting for around $60
definitely $70 will get you a good be
350 board this board here I believe
right now is selling for $65 us and it
isn't it for it is an on sale in
Australia yet but you can it'll be at
least $100 Aussie so $65 us for an a320
board
and you can get be 350 both starting at
$60 so are you I don't know I don't I
don't know I can't think of a reason why
you would buy this board as well it's
going to hate me for saying that because
I just suck me the board and say hey
check it out on box and I'm like I don't
know where you buy it but yeah it does
have four dimm slots which the cheaper
boards I start like $40 now and I think
for actually no that could be wrong
maybe $50 yeah don't rush out and try
and buy one for 40 I think they're $50
u.s. there they definitely no more than
that and you can get I think as rocker
offering the a320 em HDV and the a320 em
d GS and then just the a320 em and all
those boards are $50 I believe so $15 US
cheaper miss board they do only have two
DIMM slots this has four so it does have
more flexible memory support but then
again you get four dims for I think it's
about $10 more and you get a be 350
board so I guess the easiest way to look
at it is you can buy Rison three 1300 X
plus this board to just under $200 u.s.
and you plug it in it just works for
like for basically the same price or
even slightly cheaper let's say the same
price you can get a be 350 board with
the 1200 change one sitting in the bias
and achieve greater performance so as a
PC enthusiast this doesn't make any
sense but I could see why some people
might fire have I ranted enough and sort
of destroyed this board enough do you
think
just move on let's just move on
apologies as Rach
yeah send me one of the cheap boards and
other will build with that alright let's
see if I can be a bit more positive
about this forward there they are X 399
board though is awesome awesome very
cool workstation board are so getting
back to what we have here whatever we
have here it's a white FedEx bag but
some I think I think is chair this one
open didn't even leave my black knife
get out of here
you ready step over there that's the
back of the box creative sound card it's
actually very cool one I don't believe
this is available in Australia yet Brian
over at echo city a review but not that
long ago absolutely loves it he's a bit
of an audio buff they off camera battery
just went flat where was I
yes right so Brian over tech yes said he
did a review on this quite some time ago
now over a month ago he got an early
sample that creative offered me one
around the same time but I passed
because I'm not yeah not big into the
sound card stuff not my area of
expertise but I let Brian take care of
that one and it turns out it's actually
an extremely good sound card he
absolutely loved it and yes since then
it's pretty much got rave reviews across
the internet so if you're looking for a
sound card this may be one to get now
better this is a sound card I know what
you're thinking and yes it does have
loads of RGB wiring so you can check
that check box it's a it's an RGB
Bonanza quite a cute little neatly
wrapped static bag there maximum static
bag points looks like you have to tear
it open it's that tightly packed okay so
for those of you who are think sound
cards are boring and unnecessary and
yadda-yadda well have you seen a sound
card that looks like this
and just wait because once you plug this
in I'll definitely throw some b-roll up
of this plug-in because it is a very
impressive looking song card but of
course sound cards aren't about flashy
lights and looking pretty they're about
delivering really nice crisp audio and
apparently that's exactly what this does
so for those of you sitting there
wondering why it's oh well it does
support 32-bit 384 kilohertz playback
and it does that using the ESS is 1916
k2m saver solution so yeah it's a very
impressive a couple of things that Brian
has focused on or at least what really
impressed him about it was things like
the crosstalk there was just no leak
there didn't the left and right channels
didn't merge or blend or you know as I
said leak at all it was the lowest
crosstalk he's ever seen from a sound
card solution so he was absolutely blown
away by that he found things like bass
and a lot sort of stuff to just be
awesome through it and whenever it comes
to audio stuff I usually follow what
Brian says you haven't set me wrong yet
so I will be plugging anything later
today and seeing how it sounds and also
be testing the mic inputs and stuff like
those well doing a bit of recording with
it be a pretty cool sound card of course
for such it is an extremely premium
sound card it is rather expensive I
don't have official Australian pricing
though it is available on eBay for two
hundred and forty dollars Australians so
yeah quite pricey and it's about $150
u.s. but if you like high quality audio
and this will smoke whatever onboard
audio you can get even on the very best
motherboards before I wrap this up there
is one more thing on a touch arose
realize I don't even know if I've told
you guys what it's called I've talked
about the price and a few features
random unboxing anyway it is the sound
blaster a 5a e5 and it is creatives
first ever sound card to feature what
they call xampp technology and that is a
custom-designed discreet headphone
amplifier each channel is individually
amplified allowing it to deliver as well
in creatives words pristine audio
quality but as I said Brian found very
little crosstalk or virtually none to
speak of and was full
in a way by the audio quality so there
you go a quick little look at it I'm
going to plug it in later and check it
out I don't know if I'll review it
because like I said I'm not really a
serious audiophile like brian is that I
totally take his word he knows his stuff
when it comes to audio and this sort of
stuff really excites him the only
drawback I see with this product is the
fact that I think and don't quote me on
this I will have to confirm it do a bit
of research they think for the RGB
lighting to work because it is all fire
vault stuff you need to plug in a 4 pin
molex connector which is a bit I mean if
you have to have an external power try
to use side of these days guys and the 4
pin marks cables suck but anyway
apart from that yeah good looking see on
card of course you don't have to have
the RGB lighting on some people may
prefer not to and yet on a final note
the RGB lighting can be tied in to your
mother boards you know MSI mystic wiring
a sous or and light sort of stuff we
have two boxes left let's get into them
okay they're very heavy unusually heavy
oh yeah huh it's about time seriously
I've been left out in the cold for so
long now I don't know if you guys can
see it but it's about time I've been I
tweeted out the other day that I want to
do a 30 game benchmark looking at Vega
56 and the 64 cards I was expecting the
receive soon looks like soon is now and
I'm going to get benchmarking very very
shortly all right so let's see what we
got here anyway I don't actually know
what aimed at offense
okay so no clues so far as to what is in
here but it is an AMD a Radeon RX Vega
graphics card of some description
hopefully it's not another 56 card okay
I believe I've honestly have no idea
which way or okay the whole thing just
falls apart you guys have seen guys
unbox these you know how it works I
didn't actually watch any of themselves
too busy trying to catch up that's cool
feel like I'm a bit late to the party on
the whole unboxing Vega though there's
stuff in here something there okay okay
I hope that's not a Vega 56 card Vega 64
all right that's very very exciting very
exciting late to the party but still
very excited to get testing that AMD and
there are creative packaging these days
and I put this all back together stay oh
okay there you go back together let's
put that aside alright final package
final package what are we at like 30
minutes okay
actually since this one's open the way
it has I'll share it with you guys the
first first look at what we have the
money shot as its officially referred to
now are you ready brace yourselves huh
another radio rx Vega box what do we
have in this one
Oh alpha wolf aah hoo
I wasn't sure if I was getting one of
these I don't think there are many of
these in the country at the moment even
now a week sort of well kind of a week
after release okay so this is another
fall apart and everything goes
everywhere style box very practical I
like it I know it's not actually I take
the basket sir
it's a hey we just open like a box box
you ready okay there we go
ah that was mad exciting a little bit
and I'm far from the first person who
ever Wow
well oh look I get another thing cool
which I didn't put the other one around
there you go - giant acrylic block
things alright alright I've got some
tests we do here what is in these is
just like a power adapter or something
oh wow that's cool I feel some b-roll
that I honestly didn't watch a single Rx
of a your unboxing so I have no idea
what others got with it but here like
sort of we got with our strawberry part
here is a Vega die so that's basically
Vega 64 they're the full silicon Vega 56
will be the same and then to HBM stacks
so that's that's super cool I wonder I
finally want to go back into this one
enough is there anything in this one oh
there is awesome I got to yeah when I
win they're actually slightly different
hmm well no that's all about anyway you
guys are probably seen any iced tea
we've seen all this before from 40 other
reviewers but whatever it's new to me
finally finally wow that is an awesome
looking graphics card
sorry cool well I'm out of here
see you guys I think I benchmark
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
