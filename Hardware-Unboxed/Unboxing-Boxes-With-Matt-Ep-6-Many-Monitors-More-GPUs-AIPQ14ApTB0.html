of unboxing boxes with Matt I believe we
are now at episode 6 got a few packages
as you can see today and I think I'll
start with this black one obviously from
MSI and I'm not exactly sure what
they've sent me so pretty keen to check
it out wow this is uh actually very cool
package very very cool so this would be
my very first our X 480 partner card so
this is yes it's an 8 gigabyte model and
where have I ever been waiting to test
one of these let's pop it open we'll
have a closer look at the card itself
now that's a much better looking our X
480 I've been dying at the hands of a
partner card just so I can see how much
my reference cards truly suck this is ms
is twin frozr six card and it's pretty
damn good looking so keep your eyes
peeled for this I'll probably have this
up next week alrighty next up we've got
my very first timer package from Jill
Gail I think it's pronounced Gail so I'm
gonna go with that they did tell me what
they were sending me but to be honest I
can't quite remember exactly what it is
so we're all going to find out together
the messiest packing of all time
no that's right so we've got a desk map
from them so man I've no idea how to
pronounce anything they make dry buzz
Griffis dry fuzz no no no packaging is
pretty cool though and again get Kota
man have any normal names so it's gammy
mouse as you can see white in color what
can I tell you about it not much it's a
laser sensor 80 200 DPI looks pretty
cool pretty big probably suit of palm
grip and well check out the review to
find out more about that we'll take a
quick look at this desk mat to some sort
of design on it oh it's not a desk mat
just a mouse pad that's how she looks so
thanks Gail or Jill I think it's Gail
for the graph eyes and the gear Kota all
right my last box is from goodbye so
let's check it out see what's inside
cool so I've already looked at a couple
of customer partner cards 10 60s and one
of them was from gigabyte as well that
was the g1 gaming and that'll release so
they've been promising me a bigger
badder version and this is their extreme
gaming so this will be the top of the
line GTX 1060 let's pop over in the box
and take a look that's the card itself
so pretty damn fat from 1060 especially
it's pretty big card just so you guys
can see I've actually got the 1080
extreme gaming here still so it's what
they look like side by side the 1060 is
obviously got just the true fans whereas
10 aids got their triple fan design
that's actually looks alrighty last and
definitely not least I've actually
managed today to receive 24 partner for
IDs so really good to finally get my
hands on him it would be good to be able
to have two of them to compare and i'm
pretty sure as i say am I reference cars
going to come out looking pretty
downpour so thanks for you about for
sending that over it's been a long time
coming so pop the Box open so there g1
gaming model so i'm not sure if there is
an extreme gaming coming and yes an 8
gigabyte model as well so I'm not
expecting you know worlds better
performance from the department cards
but hopefully they operate a bit quieter
and hopefully at lower temperatures too
isn't it cute check it out
it's nice compact looking a little cub
all right so I've got one more thing to
show you guys today well three more
things really watch last week I told you
and showed you that I had two tight
necks or Pascal tight Nexus on hand
today I've got my three aoc 4k monitors
so that means very soon you got to
publish the video where I show you some
surround monitor gaming with two tight
Nexus so keep your eyes peeled for that
