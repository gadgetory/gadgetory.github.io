taking a look at the msi gs70 flagship
gaming laptop with intel's hit gen
coffee like CPUs inside a lot of you
guys have been asking me to check out
and slapped up so today we'll be going
through hopefully everything you want to
know
so the GS 65 is essentially the success
of the MSI's previous slim gaming that
top the GS 63 which I've looked at
previously msi had used the g 63 design
for a couple of generations now but this
new tier 65 design upgrades many areas
including the hardware and design it
still uses a 15.6 inch 1080p display but
we're now looking at slimmer bezels and
an upgrade to a 144 Hertz refresh rate
hardware wise there's nothing out of the
ordinary for a high-end laptop in 2018
the CPU is Intel's Core i7
8750 H that we've reviewed previously
and the GPU is invidious geforce gtx
1070 max q there's also 16 gig of ram
and a 512 gig SSD in my review unit
though that combination does vary in
different regions msi clearly wasn't
happy with gigabyte claiming all the
accolades for its slim bezel gaming
laptop the aro 15 X so they too have
gone this slim bezel approach here the
GS 65 s bezels aren't quite as slim as
what we see with the Aero 15 X but they
are much slimmer than on the GS 63 and
crucially msi has achieved this without
giving us a nostril vision webcam as you
can see the top bezel is slightly
thicker than the sides and in there msi
has managed to fit in a webcam with
slimmer bezels comes a smaller laptop
and comparing dimensions reveals the GS
65 to have a slightly smaller footprint
than its predecessor about 22
millimeters has been shaved off the
width with a similar depth all while
maintaining the same 17.9 millimeters of
thickness
these aren't massive figures but any
size reduction while still including the
same hardware is welcome and it keeps
the laptop as portable as possible
plus it's still reasonably light at just
one point eight eight
kilograms I always like the design of
the GS 63 but this new GS 65 is simply a
class above it's by far the best-looking
MSI laptop ever with an excellent metal
shell and subtle yet attractive gold
highlights around the lid trackpad vents
and more almost every area of this slim
chassis has been refined it now exudes
premium quality small touches like
simplifying the logo on the lid and
removing other game elements have worked
wonders and if we remove the annoying
stickers below the keyboard the
minimalist design only becomes more
impressive the key thing with the GS 65
design is despite opting for a high coil
in metal chassis MSI hasn't compromised
the cooling solution there are still a
ton of vents on the system including the
sides rear top and bottom we've seen
with laptops like the razor blade that a
metal design is good but it can limit
the cooler quite significantly however
this doesn't appear to be the case with
the GS 65 despite a significant amount
of edge space going to the cooling vents
there are plenty of ports on this laptop
three USB 3.0 type-a ports Thunderbolt 3
USB C Ethernet HDMI 2.0 mini DisplayPort
and two audio jacks
unfortunately there's no SD card slot
which would have been handy for
professionals however I am glad MSI
moved the position of the power button
back to a more sensible location above
the keyboard used to be on the edge and
it was pretty easy to accidentally press
it speaking of the keyboard MSI has used
their standard steel series design with
perky RGB LED backlighting notably
there's no numpad on the GS 65 which I
tend to think should come with the 15
inch laptop the arrow 15 X for example
does manage to cram a numpad into a
similar chassis not a big deal for games
though is mostly a nitpick the travel
distance from this keyboard is rather
unimpressive MSI has opted for an
ultrabook style switch with a shallow
rubbery response I prefer a more clicky
design and I know it is possible with a
laptop keyboard but the limited amount
of space MSI has allocated to the depth
of these switches has no doubt
constrained this keyboards performance
on the other hand the trackpad is very
responsive and an improvement to the old
elin days
though mostly you'll want to use a
proper mouse for actual gaming removing
the bottom panel of the g65 reveals a
flipped motherboard unfortunately while
you can see the battery and cooling
components to a small extent any access
to the RAM and MDOT two slots is fairly
difficult as you have to remove the
entire motherboard and cooling assembly
first there are a lot of small fragile
connectors along the way so it's not
something I'd advise for the casual user
however if you do want to go down that
path you will find a spare em not to
slot and a spare dim slot interestingly
MSI has used a triple fan cooling design
here with a single cooler on the left
for the CPU and a dual fan cooler for
the GPU on the right the extra fan for
the GPU is a bit unique though the
heatsink design isn't anything unusual
and actually provides a good amount of
fin area certainly a lot more than the
air of 50 X before heading into
performance I did want to touch on the
display as I mentioned earlier it's a
1080p 144 Hertz IPS type display and
while it doesn't include g-sync I do
appreciate the high refresh right now I
really hope this becomes standard in
gaming laptops like with the bezel size
it's clear that MSI are targeting the
area 15 X with this displays calibration
while not X right Pantone certified the
Gio 65s display is much more accurate
than any MSI laptop I've reviewed in the
past it's not perfect but an average CCT
of 68 or 4k is decent to go along with
average Delta ease of 2.2 in grayscale
2.2 to in saturation and 2.73 in color
checker for the best results these
figures should be below 2.0 at least
however considering past efforts this is
a pretty decent improvement
unfortunately perhaps as a result of
tighter calibration brightness and
contrast are unimpressive it does reach
just 248 nits of peak brightness and
that's not great and neither is a sub
1000 to 1 contrast ratio both of these
areas are handily beaten by the error 15
X which packs a similar display and
somewhat superior calibration let's move
on to performance now and I'm not going
to spend a lot of time on this as I've
previously covered a lot of this systems
hardware in other reviews the core i7
8750 h ng
force gtx 1070 max-q combination I've
covered extensively in previous stats so
if you're interested in both CPU and GPU
performance unser jest checking out my
original coverage of the i 78750 h
however it is still important to
benchmark the GS 65 specifically to see
if there are any performance anomalies
or other interesting talking points
relative to the original results we got
through the CPU and GPU and there's one
that sticks out immediately
the factor system has single channel
memory compared to the dual channel
configuration we used in our initial i7
a 750 H benchmarks as I showed in my
review of the gigabyte arrow 15 X which
also used a single channel memory the
reduce memory bandwidth provided by this
sort of configuration does hurt both
productivity and gaming workloads in
some instances this chart shows the
performance difference between the msi
ge62 5 and our original dual channel
memory i 78750 H benchmark results in a
range of productivity tests some
workloads like encoding rendering and
Excel are largely unaffected by single
channel memory others like the Adobe
suite compression and MATLAB are more
heavily influenced by reduce memory
bandwidth and as such can be up to 29%
slower if you plan on using apps that
are memory bandwidth sensitive and
suggest chucking in an extra stick of
RAM to get dual channel bandwidth how
does the GS 65 stealth in it fare in a
direct comparison with the gigabyte
error 15 X well both of these laptops
have single channel memory and in most
tasks you can see the GS 65 is slightly
slower for the most part we're only
talking about a 5 percent performance
difference or less and this is down to a
simple hardware difference the aro 15 X
uses ddr4 2666 for a single stick which
is the maximum ddr4 speed coffee-like
supports while the GS 65 uses ddr4 2400
again this is something you can address
yourself with a ram swap but with a 5
percent difference it might not be worth
it in a lot of cases if you're thinking
of upgrading from an older laptop with
the i7 7700 HQ inside you can expect to
see hefty gains in productivity
workloads the eye 78758 provides an
upgrade from four to six cores
clock speed boosts in every situation
which allows it to provide huge
performance improvements in
multi-threaded tasks Cinebench r15 Excel
7-zip decompression and x264 encoding
all benefit the most with gains up to 64
percent and typically at least 50
percent more single photo tasks tend to
see single digit gains but there's still
an improvement here so we'll take it
here's the Cinebench r15 chart that
shows how the GS 65 stacks up in more
concrete numbers rather than relative
terms again if you want to see more
charts like this and more in depth
discussion on the AI 78758 check my
original coverage of that cpu and keep
in mind the relative differences we've
looked at so far as for gaming with the
gtx 1070 max-q in general this GPU when
paired with the i7
8750 H is quite capable of 1080p ultra
quality gaming at around 60 fps in the
latest titles obviously the most
punishing games will tax this GPU a bit
harder than that as its performance it's
between a gtx 1060 and a fully fledged
ATX 1070 but overall it provides a
decent experience again as we're looking
at single channel memory some games
don't perform as well as an equivalent
system with dual channel memory games
like Assassin's Creed origins
battlefield one pray and Mass Effect
Andromeda and he took a noticeable
degree looking at 1% low results with
typical performance drops around 20%
though it can be as high as 40% in some
cases other games like rise of the Tomb
Raider Star Wars Battlefront 2 dirt 4
and GTA 5 are less heavily impacted with
either no performance drop or just
single-digit drops when comparing the GS
65 to the area of 50 next performance is
pretty close on average though this
slower memory speed of the GS 65 does
have a small impact across the board
some games exhibit a double-digit
performance loss relative to the area 15
X while others are either equivalent or
slightly faster on average we're looking
at about a 3% difference which isn't
that much at all we've found previously
that in a like-for-like system
configuration you get around 10%
performance boost from the AI 78758
we're moving from a core i7 7700 HQ at
least when the GPU is too
at gtx970 max-q however again memory
bandwidth does have a say in this if
you're moving from a dual-channel 7700
HQ system to a single channel 8750 h
system you actually see a performance
loss on average or at the very least no
significant gain in games if you're
deciding what GPU is right for you
here's a quick breakdown of how the gtx
1070 max-q slots in among other popular
laptop GPUs it's around 20% faster than
the GTX 1060 but upwards of 12 percent
slower than a full gtx 1070 and the GTX
980 max-q tends to be around 25 to 30
percent faster no laptop review would be
complete without discussing thermal and
acoustic performance in such a slim
laptop you're never going to get amazing
results in this department especially
with such powerful hardware the msi does
do as much as possible to keep things in
check the GS 65 is neither outrageously
hot nor definitely loud as a result when
playing watchdogs to the g65 CPU reaches
around 89 degrees Celsius while the GPU
set at 86 degrees ideally I'd like to
see the GPU a bit cooler than that
that's fairly hot for a laptop GPU but
CPU temperatures are in line with other
gaming laptops in CPU only workloads you
can expect the CPU to sit more at 81
degrees with no throttling unless you're
running a power virus acoustics is where
I was more impressed with the GS 65
under a watchdogs to load the system's
triple fan cooler produced is 44 DBA of
noise which is significantly quieter
than its main competitor with identical
hardware the area 15 X the impressive
aisa predator Triton 700 edges both
laptops out in this test but either way
the g65 s cool annoys is relatively easy
to drown out with game noise in a CPU
only workload hand braking coding in
this case the cooler wasn't as loud at
40.6 DBA that's mid-range for a gaming
laptop of this size though again notably
quieter than the aro 15 X as for battery
life the g65 includes an eighty-two watt
hour battery which is fairly sizable for
a 15-inch laptop but not quite as large
as the
Plus what our units we see in the best
devices as a result battery life is
roughly where I expected for a gaming
laptop not horrendous like the early
days of gaming laptops but not amazing
either you won't get ultrabook battery
life out of this system but it is
capable of a decent amount of usage away
from the charger especially if you're
just doing light tasks like web browsing
like with most portable gaming laptops
the msi ge62 5 stealth in is pretty
expensive at 2100 US dollars for the
newest configuration to what we used
it's not unfairly priced though as
competitors like the gigabyte aro 15 X
and a soos ROG Sepphoris cost a similar
amount and what you end up going with
does come down to the features and other
aspects in that case when considering
everything this laptop provides I really
like what msi has brought to the table
this is clearly their best gaming laptop
ever bringing a superior design smaller
footprint and improved performance
compared to the GS 63 the build quality
is fantastic and the cooling
surprisingly decent in acoustics
providing a better experience than the
Aero 15 X its closest competitor in both
aspects my main concern is the use of
single channel memory out of the box
which leads to reduce performance
compared to a dual channel setup though
this is also an issue with the Aero 15 X
however the internal layout of the GS 65
makes this problem difficult to fix on
your own it is fixable just you'll need
to take out the entire motherboard and
be careful in the process a slight nut
though MSI has really nailed this laptop
it's a great Buy
and I love seeing companies continue to
iterate on their designs and produce
even more compelling hardware that's it
