unboxing of the new msi r-tx
20 80 TI gaming extra oh man I'm just
kidding
will actually do a proper review of how
to take out of the box ok enough
trolling I know the channel name is
Harbor unbox but as many of you guys
know who watches regularly we don't do
too many videos where we just unbox
products we do the unboxing box a series
but that's almost trolling ourselves I
don't know that's a bit of fun anyway
but today's video yes we're checking
this card out we're gonna pull it apart
we're going to test it out top to bottom
I'm going to see what it is capable of
and actually I have it right here yeah
it's a pretty big graphics card as you
can plainly see so this is my first look
on my first official look at a board
partner card and I guess you could say
that we're going big right off the bat
by starting with what is arguably the
biggest RT X xx atti
graphics card on the market it's
certainly a big slot bending monster
actually I shouldn't have said that the
slot bending bit was just meant as a
joke the graphics card itself won't
actually break your motherboard that is
a common misconception that heavy
graphics cards break PCI Express slots
they don't actually do that you'll see
some companies like MSI they have their
marketed as their or whatever it's
called some metal bracing around the
slot and that is to stop the slot from
breaking but not from a graphics card
breaking it it's from basically you
being a knucklehead or me so the PCI
Express slots have a retention clip at
the end which clips onto this little
doohickey here I don't know if you can
see that on camera and some people undo
the card up here with the screws and
then they got to pull it out and because
it's quite a heavy card they yank on it
quite quite aggressively and it takes
the slot with them because the retention
clip holds on nicely it pulls the back
of there the slot up and the pins all go
everywhere and it's a mess and you
basically kill your motherboard that way
so that is what the PCI Express armor is
for cards don't break it they sit like
that and they can say
so MSI has included an anti-bending
reinforcement brace or something along
those lines that you can put on to give
the card a bit more bit more structure
bit more strength to something from
sagging any case but as I said common
misconception it doesn't destroy your
PCIe slot if it did I would have gone
through many more motherboards in my
test systems than I do like most of the
behemoths we've come across over the
years this thing does hog three
expansion slots but again that's pretty
typical and we did see this with the GT
X 1080 Ti lightning Z model that
particular 1080i was one of my absolute
favorites but it did tip the scales at
an insane sixteen hundred and
seventy-five grams and for that I called
it a porker the new gaming edge trio is
a little bit more lean a bit more of a
lean beast and it weighs in a
comparatively light fourteen hundred and
twenty grams so still obviously quite a
heavy graphics card I actually thought
the r-tx 20/80 TI fe card was quite
heavy but it only ended up weighing
twelve hundred and sixty-six grams I
guess I'm getting weaker in my old age
though that is still quite heavy for
what is a relatively compact high-end
graphics card the trio of course is
significantly larger in fact in terms of
dimensions it measures 327 millimeters
long 140 millimeters tall and 56
millimeters thick so our IP Mini ITX
builds for a big lump of a graphics card
the gaming x-trail looks pretty great in
my opinion any size dialed down the red
highlights so it's much more neutral
themed they haven't gone completely
neutral but it's much more minimalistic
there's a couple of small red highlights
on the fans and then on this side of the
graphics card facing usually outwards in
a traditional mount of course as you'd
expect there is plenty of a Haji B
lining on display though I have to say
it looks very good and there's a number
of really nice lighting effects and
modes that can be accessed in MSI's
mystic lighting software for this demo
though I'm just using the default
rainbow mode but I assume at this point
you guys know how RGB lighting works so
let's move on before getting to the
benchmarks we will quickly tear the card
down and have a good look at the fans
and the cooler and the PCB and what's on
the PCB all that stuff's somewhat
important so we'll check all that out
but please note the focus this video is
mostly going to be on the thermal
performance and overclocking will put
some k-type thermocouple x' on there as
well and we'll gamers Nexus the crap out
of it so should be pretty good of course
we will test some games out as well so
we'll get to that and see how the
overclocks work and what the out of the
box performance is like and how it
compares to the found Edition model
though please note I only have these
stock founders Edition numbers as I only
had time to test the founders Edition
card in two games it's about 5% faster
with a manual overclock but I haven't
gone back and compared to all the games
I did with this because Tim has hijacked
my r-tx
20 ATT I found addition cards that's now
with him and you may have already seen
some of the content he's doing this but
he has a lot of stuff lined up I've had
to share rights off with the backplate
first this requires the removal of 14
screws 5 of which are attached to the
massive heatsink on the opposite side of
the PCB with the other 9 fastening down
the GDD r6 heat spreader I have to say
the backplate on the gaming
tray looks very impressive I like the
cutout vents and I really like how the
brushed aluminium is brushed in two
different directions it gives a very
cool effect and it reflects light in a
really interesting way i'm also very
fond of how depending on the angle that
you view it from will go from sort of a
light shade of silver to a darker shade
of silver almost a gunmetal gray color
in fact it looks very cool and yeah i
like viewing the card from different
angles just to see that effect in action
once removed we can see that the back
side of the plate features thermal pads
and these are located behind where the
GPU and GD dr 6 would be situated on the
opposite side of the PCB the intention
here is to extract any built-up heat
that would get trapped behind the back
plate these pads are very effective at
transferring heat through the aluminium
backplate and that effectively turns it
into sort of a massive heat spreader
next the massive heatsink comes off and
this section of the card accounts for
1022 grams of the cards total weight
here we find a large nickel plated
copper base which comes in direct
contact with half a dozen nickel plated
heat pipes and of course they are also
made out of copper in total there is
only one eight millimeter heat pipe and
five six millimeter pipes
ms:i calls this a concentrated heat pipe
design basically these heat pipes are
used to maximize heat extraction from
the base and then spread it through the
massive array of fins so basically they
work out heat pipes basically work then
moving air through all those fins are
three tox 3.0 fans are the center and
right fans measure a hundred millimeters
in diameter while the left fan is
slightly smaller at 85 millimeters but
there is a reason for why that fans
smaller than the other two it does look
a bit odd but the reason that MSI has
had to do this is because they've had to
carve out room to support MV link or SLI
if I hadn't done this they would have
needed to provide I suppose a custom
adapter though most bored partners
already do this that I would mentally
their only change the look of the card
and not the physical design so perhaps
this causes latency issues by extending
the actual connectors not a hundred
percent sure on that one
in any case MSI has made this design
choice the fans themselves feature a
unique blade design and double ball
bearings or as MSI says gaming with
balls of steel sure every second fan
blade features a dispersion blade which
msi says accelerates airflow interesting
stuff but we'll have to take their word
that it's not just a marketing gimmick
then if we remove the fans we get to the
big star of the show the actual heatsink
of a big old stack of fins the heatsink
weighs 777 grams and I have to say it
looks very nice it's almost a shame to
hide this thing under those fans and of
course the shroud MSI is employed what I
suppose is called a wavy curvy design
which they claim allows the air to pass
more smoothly across and through the
fins and this results in less noise the
theory goes something like this
the air directed by the fans hits the
top of the heatsink and with them so far
if the fins are flat as they more
traditionally are this wall of fins
creates turbulence okay
which increases the operating volume the
wavy curvy design a breaks up the
turbulent air and better directs it
through the fins apparently maximizing
airflow and reducing noise again at this
point I'm going to have to take their
word from up at the card
is very quiet so I suppose there's that
interestingly one little tidbit the
center section of the fins between the
heat pipes features pressed out pockets
which msi says controls the airflow and
feeds it towards the heat sinks allowing
heat to be more efficiently removed from
the source what I can tell you is that
the heat sink looks very cool and as I
said it's a shame this beauty gets
covered up by so many bits and pieces
I'd love to see MSI deploy this heat
sink or this heat sink design on their
motherboards and when they if they do
decide to take my advice and do that
please don't cover them in plastic
shrouds
I just wish someone would try that out
and just see what the sales are like and
if they don't sell that well then I'll
finally shut up about it okay so moving
on we've now worked our way to the PCB
where we find a few interesting things
the highlight here is of course the
power delivery system which sees 14
phases for the GPU and three phases for
the GDD r6 memory there's also an insane
trio of PCIe connectors though they
haven't just gone with 3/8 pins we have
a single six with two eight pin
connectors before we move on to do some
custom overclocking I thought I'd just
point out the kind of clocks that MSI
have applied at a factory the Bruce
clock has been set at seventeen hundred
and fifty-five megahertz which is a
seven percent increase over the founders
edition model which is also overclocked
to sixteen hundred and thirty five
megahertz from the well I suppose the
official spec is supposed to be fifteen
hundred and forty five megahertz of
course GPU boost 4.0 can take advantage
of this massive cooler to boost the
clock speeds even higher and stock it
maintained eighteen hundred and sixty
megahertz for all the games that we
tested whereas the failed edition model
ran at six percent lower at seventeen
hundred and fifty five megahertz still
out of the box the msi geforce r-tx
twenty eight ETI gaming extra oh won't
be blowing any socks off in terms of FPS
performance at least any more so than
the r-tx twenty ATT i already does I
suppose is what I'm trying to say that
said I expect the temperature and
operating volumes to be lower than that
of the FE card the first thing I wanted
to do before messing around overclocking
MSI's afterburner utility was to see how
hot
this card ran in its out-of-the-box
configuration so to do that we fired up
shadow of the Tomb Raider and of course
we do have a MSI X trio version of the
RT X xx atti so I went straight to the
4k resolution with the highest quality
presets I cranked everything up and boy
did it look good and it was also very
nice and smooth which was surprising
given the video quality but we were
seeing I think it was a 52 fps we'll get
to the results soon I think was 52 FPS
for the 1% low so very smooth there at
an average of around 6 dealing with 62
fps so certainly very impressive
performance given those visual quality
settings what I was keen to keep an eye
on here was the GPU temperature and with
a 76 degree reference temperature from
the founders vision model I was hoping
to see better results thankfully I did
get a better result though it wasn't
that much better 72 degrees but there's
a little bit more to this story this
temperature was achieved at a fan speed
of just 1499 rpm which I would describe
a silent with the card installed in a PC
case and it's worth pointing out that
the fan speed was 30% lower than that of
the EFI model the idle temperature
though looks surprisingly high though
once you realise that the fans don't
spin at all in the cards at idle 47
degrees probably isn't that surprising
and keep in mind I'm reporting this
temperature after the stress test with a
10 minute cooldown period so it's a lot
of the cards have been sitting there
doing nothing for a really long time
it's only ten minutes after we hit the
peak temperature right so the next step
was to do a little tinkering and see
just how fast we can make the gaming X
trio after much trial and error the core
accepted a value of plus 140 and the GDD
are six memory plus 750 this resulted in
a peak core frequency of 2040 megahertz
when gaming and the average frequency
after an hour-long stress test was 2025
minutes without any alterations to the
fan profile the fans spent up to just
1542 rpm allowing for a GPU temperature
of 75 degrees out of interest though I
did fix the fan speed at 60% which spun
them up to 2200 rpm and this reduced the
core temperature to just 62 degrees
then at 100% the fans were whizzing
around at about 3400 rpm and this
reduced the GPU peak temperature to 53
degrees with an idle temperature that
was just above ambient at 25 degrees and
by the way the ambient air temperature
during these tests was 22 degrees
throwing on a few k-type thermocouple
'he's allowed us to measure the surface
temperature of the power stages and GDD
our six memory our overclock using the
auto fan speed settings saw the VRM idle
at 34 degrees with the memory at 35
degrees then under load the vrm hit 49
degrees and the memory 57 degrees both
well within tolerances therefore in
terms of cooling performance the msi
geforce r-tx 28 ET i gaming extra
performed much better than the geforce
fe r-tx 28 ET i so let's move on to a
few FPS benchmarks first up we have the
battlefield 1 results at the 4k
resolution using the maximum quality
preset otherwise known as ultra the 20
ATT IFA impressed us with 100 FPS on
average and I'm not saying that it's
great value guys when I say that it
impressed me I'm just saying that 100
FPS on average at 4k under these
conditions is a lot of frames the gaming
extra was 3% faster on average and 5%
faster 51 percent lower result our
custom overclock boosted the performance
by a further 8 percent to an incredible
111 fps now when testing with shadow of
the Tomb Raider the MSI model is 5
percent faster out of the box and so a
further five percent boost via our
customer overclock making it 44 percent
faster than the MSI gaming extra gtx
980ti here we see a mere 2% increase
when testing with strange brigade over
the founders edition model it was again
possible to boost performance by a
further 5% with our custom overclock
then an f1 2018 we see basically the
same out-of-the-box performance when
compared to the fau model though this
time we do see a 7 percent boost from
our overclock then we see another small
4 percent boost when testing with Far
Cry 5 and this time our overclock
provided 6 percent more performance the
last game I'm going to look at is
assassin's creed origins and again
pretty typical of what we've seen so far
so let's just move on to the power
sumption here we see a very slight
increase in consumption over the
foundation model basically the same
result there as we're talking about less
than a percentage here so I suppose you
could even say margin of error
overclocking did increase total system
consumption by five percent but then we
also did see an average of about five
percent increase in terms of frame
performance so that's certainly not a
bad trade-off the msi geforce r-tx 28
ETA gaming extra oh and that's the last
bloody time I'm gonna say the entire
name I think didn't I make up a rule
where two words is the limit and I know
people let me go gaming trio is two
words well I'm including the letter X as
a word because you have to say it so
it's three that's the new rules I'm
making these rules up as we go they're
my rules anyway as I was about to say
before I distracted myself the gaming X
trio is pretty much everything I thought
it would be it's slightly quieter than
the founders ition version which is
already very quiet it's slightly cooler
and to top it all off it is slightly
faster so depending on how you view all
that you could conclude that it's only
slightly better I personally feel that
because it is slightly better everything
overall it is much better but I suppose
however you slice it it is better as one
of the highest clocked custom-design RT
X xx atti graphics cards with one of the
biggest coolers I have to imagine what
we have here is one of the better xx
atti models available right now of
course I'm yet to test any other AI b28
et eyes but I will soon anyway for now I
can recommend to the gaming extra o2
anyone with a giant wad of cash burning
a hole in their pocket anyway RTX 28 ET
i pricing is what it is and I've given
my strong opinion on the matter in our
initial coverage so I won't dredge that
up all over again if you want to hear or
interested in hearing my opinion please
go watch my day 1 and day 2 videos
speaking of the price MSI has managed to
come in at just 50 dollars more than in
videos founders Edition which is
impressive given how much more graphics
card you get of course $1,250 us is
still a hard price to swallow but that's
what you pay these days for 4k single
GPU gaming it seems so it's the biggest
drawback out of the way the price
what other shortcomings are there to
discuss honestly not much overclocking
was a little lackluster but that's not
really msis fault
these cards are power limited via the
BIOS so any model with a high quality
cooler will deliver similar results the
results there are amazing the trio acts
barely makes a peep as it cranks out
over 60fps and all of your favorite
titles at 4k the visual quality really
is breathtaking though of course it's
not ray traced yet though it won't be
ray traced at 4k so forget I said
anything in short if you have an RT x
2080 TI on your shopping list there's no
way I'd be buying the founders edition
version over this particular model M sis
I really now lit in my opinion this is a
great looking card great performance I'm
not shilling for MSI as some people will
no doubt claim in the comments section
below this is genuinely a great product
that I don't really have anything bad to
say about I mean it's not MSI's fault
the RT x 2080 TI is ridiculously
expensive and i've said so in my day 1
and day 2 coverage but if you are in the
market for one you've gone bugger it I'm
paying 1200 something dollars for a
graphics card because I'm an absolute
nutter then this is the perfect graphics
card for an utter but in all seriousness
great product really liked it and this
will be my new go-to graphics card for a
light testing in my GPU test system in
the future so you'll see some CPU
comparisons coming up in the
not-too-distant future
stay that's somewhat risky but I'm gonna
do it I'm going for it it's a stable
desk
yes I'll be using this to compare rise
and an Intel processors you guys are
requesting like crazy that I test
something like the 2700 X and 87 or okay
with this graphics card and yes I will
do that maybe next week probably the
week after I need to catch up on some
sleep still so I'm pretty exhausted and
I'm looking forward to taking a few days
off for letting Tim carry the torch for
a bit anyway if you did enjoy this video
you know what to do if you would like to
see more content on this channel I hope
you know what to do and if you would
like to support us directly I'm going to
tell you what to do head over to our
patreon account
you can jump into our discord chat chat
to us and pretty much any time of the
day and you can also catch our monthly
live stream because that is coming up
next week and it's a lot of fun we'll be
doing two of them yeah it's just a blast
we just hang out answer questions talk
about stuff it's really good fun
anyway I'm waffling as I tend to do
thank you for watching
I'm your host Steve and see you next
