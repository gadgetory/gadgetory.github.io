been asked multiple times a day if not
hourly over the past few weeks Matt what
should I buy the RX 480 or the gtx 1060
as is often the case it isn't as simple
as just picking one and recommending it
to everyone there's a number of factors
that should influence you buying choice
from the games you play to system specs
and perhaps most importantly pricing in
your region that being the case I really
don't like to tell people which one they
should buy instead I prefer to create an
in-depth benchmark video that presents
all the facts and this is something I've
already done for both these cards in
question still for some many of you that
doesn't seem to be enough
you want me to straight-out tell you
where to invest your money so I decided
to put myself in your shoes I gave
myself an imaginary budget of 450 ozzie
and when shopping online now I know in
video has been copying a heap of stick
about the MSRP S or R are peers as they
refer to in Australia the founders
edition should cost 300 US dollars which
is about $400 dollars while the board
partner cars should cost as little as
250 US or around 340 RZ as it stands
right now on the 28th of July it's
possible to order the EVGA GTX 1060
ACF's 2.0 card for $400 that's currently
the cheapest local option for
Australians the gigabyte GTX 1060 g1
gaming that are reviewed yesterday is
price of the hideous $500 so you won't
get to buy a GTX 1060 for less than $400
down under any time soon it seems
alright bug you that in video let's turn
to AMD and their new cost per frame
champion the 4 gigabyte model is meant
to cost just two hundred US dollars
while the a kickabout model is priced at
$240 converted that's roughly 270 RZ for
the 4 gigabyte and 320 for the Akio bite
model 270 dollars is heaps better than
$400 right so let's go with that
ok hang on a sec there isn't a single 4
gigabyte model on sale here in Australia
not one oh well not the end of the world
the a gigabyte version of the $320 is
still a steal having looked up the
prices the cheapest RX for ad I could
find was $360 it looks like a dummy
price since you can't pre-order and
there isn't any stock I found the same
issue with the model advertiser $370
from another retailer while PC case gear
has the achy
model is $380 on pre-order if you're
willing to wait at least three weeks so
what if you want to buy one right now
well you might have in the soos model
for $440 and they say this plenty of
stock of course this is just a reference
card but you can buy it right now the
same retailer also lists the Galaxy
force gtx 1060 EXO c4 four hundred and
forty dollars and again says there's
plenty of stock and waivers also selling
the same model for four hundred forty
dollars and has stopped right now so it
looks like a stray Lian's a face with a
$440 asking price for either a reference
version rx 488 gigabyte or an
aftermarket custom gtx 1060 from galaxy
for me the choice is simple the galaxy
CX 1060 all day personally I couldn't
face owning an RX 480 reference card
it's hot and it's loud had there been a
custom board party card available at
$440 I might have had to think twice
that said the gtx 1060 is hands down the
fastest GPU and it also provides greater
gains when overclocked as for my
american friends the choice looks even
easier newegg.com lists the zotac gtx
1060 mini as in stock and for sale for
$250 meanwhile is just a single RX 480
and stop and for some reasons listed a
410 bucks over on amazon we find much
the same the cheapest RX for ad cost 360
and of course it's a reference card
there are a few gtx 1060 options but
they're all more expensive than Newegg
but there are a number of options priced
below 300 60 bucks
speaking of Newegg it is possible for
Z's to purchase the zotac gtx 1060 mini
for 335 Australian dollars plus 45
dollars shipping that means you can land
a custom 1064 380 Ozzy making this the
obvious choice again new AG is showing
stop for Ozzy shoppers and shipping
tapes just four to seven business days
so MD might have beaten a video to the
punch with the rx 480 and their
announcement and supposed release but as
of right now looks like the GTX 1060 is
winning the battle I'm sure once our X
480 availability improves and we start
to see board partner cards into the
market things could very well change but
until then I think the choice is pretty
clear-cut what do you guys think are you
planning to buy either of these cards
