corner with Thanksgiving in the United
States this week there hasn't been a ton
of news but it wouldn't be an episode of
news corn without at least a few
interesting stories so I guess let's get
right to it one of the more
controversial issues to emerge this week
concerns
AMD's rise in mobile and its drivers
support there hasn't been a lot of
public discussion about rising mobile
drivers but anyone that owns or has
owned a rise in mobile laptop knows that
the drivers situation is a complete mess
while rising mobile does include a
radeon GPU anywhere from vega 3 up to
vega 11 most systems using the apu
haven't seen a single driver update for
the platform since launch this is
problematic for a number of reasons
firstly rising mobile as a first
generation platform shipped with quite a
few bugs some which I noted in my review
of the APU
almost a year ago things like Premiere
and blender not supporting GPU
acceleration some weird graphical
effects in games issues with changing
resolutions VLC issues and more to not
get a single driver update since launch
means all of these issues are still
present in laptops using Rison mobile
right now secondly buyers of rising
mobile systems are missing out on the
numerous Drive optimizations that AMD
has included in their drivers over the
past year which are fully accessible to
those with desktop aps or discrete GPUs
from the company so any performance
uplifts in games or even proper support
for games in the first place and not
available for rise in mobile that's
basically where rise of mobile drivers
are currently at and naturally this has
been a source of frustration for buyers
well I guess I say frustration that's
putting it a bit nicely I guess judging
by reddit comments people are absolutely
furious at the state of drivers right
now which I guess is fair enough
considering the issues anyway
AMD made rising mobile owners even more
furious with a statement this week
suggesting they're working with OEMs to
deliver a twice annual update of
graphics drivers specifically for all
AMD rising mobile processor based
systems they go on to say that because
the drivers are ultimately controlled by
OEMs this may vary from platform to
platform but we want to put out
clear goal for us and our OEM partners
and that drivers would be available
through om websites not AMD comm now on
face value to drive updates is better
than zero but clearly two updates a year
isn't really good enough and considering
they're still going to be delivered by
OEMs who are completely hopeless when it
comes to these things who knows whether
that will even eventually and it seems
the community agrees with this because
one of the top upvoted posts on our AMD
right now is a big complaint about the
state of drivers and this response from
AMD however there is may be some good
news for rising bar bar owners I spoke
with someone from AMD earlier this week
who was a bit frustrated with the
company's official response because of
its vague wording which seems to have
caused the community to go into meltdown
the vagueness comes from the final
sentence which reads in addition AMD
will continue to evaluate ways in which
we can offer validated graphics drivers
for AMD rising mobile processor based
notebooks aligned to the latest AMD
software updates and we will provide
updates as soon as we are able now if
you read that part of the statement it
just sounds like a nothing fluffy
promise with no specifics whatsoever AMD
is always working towards better drivers
so it's not exactly a groundbreaking
announcement however I have a lot of
additional information on how rising
mobile drivers are shaping up in the
future so let's talk about what it
sounds like the plants are firstly AMD
are without a doubt working towards
getting rising mobile graphics drivers
released in line with their discrete
desktop cards this means that at some
point in the future
rising them about GPU drive updates will
be available from AMD comm and will be
launched around the same time of their
desktop equivalents this is basically
how it works with both Intel and NVIDIA
GPU drivers for laptops the twice annual
driver update is referring to a separate
update package that will be available
through OEMs the way was described to me
this sounds like a long term driver with
full om support something that you could
revert back to in case of any issues you
know that sort of thing again this is I
guess fairly typical in the OEM space
the OEM itself will provide a baseline
supportive driver through their website
while each component manufacturer for
example real tech with HD audio drivers
might offer a newer version that users
can download
through their website currently the
issue is OMS occasionally update their
supported drivers for things like audio
and Wi-Fi but they have not been
updating the APU and GPU drivers so the
twice annual update is a way to
accelerate that process but the big
change will come when Andy begins
offering a separate GPU update package
through AMD comm this is what the final
line of their statement is supposed to
be referring to it might say the company
is merely evaluating ways in which they
can offer those drivers and will provide
updates as soon as they are able but
from what Andy told me those driver
releases am more a case of when not if
now you might be asking yourself why
can't AMD just upload rising mobile GPU
drivers to AMD calm right now we know we
can hack current drivers to install and
rise and robot and they work just fine I
think that's a pretty good question so
the issue comes down to a number of
themes but the primary one is the way om
drivers are distributed specifically om
drivers are often tied into the Windows
Update framework so when you purchase a
laptop that say I've been sitting on the
shop for a while it will automatically
update to the latest om supported
drivers some OEMs also have separate
utilities that will download official
OEM drivers the main obstacle appears to
be in this om driver delivery system AMD
said that there are issues where even if
you installed an official GPU driver
from AMD comm the OEM system whether
that's windows update or an OEM utility
would simply overwrite and reinstall an
older om supported driver instead so
anybody needs to work with OEMs and
presumably Microsoft as well to stop
that from happening before they're
willing to provide drivers through AMD
calm it might be an excuse but this is
something I've had issues with on some
laptops not necessarily for GPU drivers
but certainly Windows Update attempting
to revert back to older drivers that
issue does crop up from time to time as
for a timeline on when this might get
resolved it sounds like AMD is targeting
the launch of next-generation Rison
mobile processes sometime in 2019 yep
that could be some time away but it's a
better time frame than the complete lack
of a time frame aimed he gave in their
statement and to clarify this doesn't
mean only next-gen rising mobile app
drops will be able to download these
only provided drivers rather that's just
around the time
his drivers should be available to all
now I'm not saying that all of this will
definitely happen it's just what ambi
was telling me when I asked a number of
clarifying questions about this
statement and with Rison mobile I'm not
sure we're in a position where we can
fully trust what they are saying but if
what they are saying is the truth it
sounds like there is genuine work being
made towards fixing the rise of mobile
driver ecosystem as with
first-generation ecosystems which are
very raw there has been certainly a lot
of early-adopter pain with this one and
a lot of the blame does have to go to
the OEMs as well which are generally
hopeless at getting out these driver
updates but we'll see how it progresses
and hopefully there's good news coming
in 2019 and I've talked about drivers
content adaptive shading also known as
variable rate shading has come to
Wolfenstein to the new courses this new
shading technology is exclusive to
Nvidia strewing architecture for now and
it works in quite an interesting way it
basically allows the shading engine to
shade some areas of the screen at
non-native rates if it's appropriate to
do so so for example some areas of the
screen that would exhibit no quality
loss from less than native rate shading
like say the sky in a game could be
shaded at a quarter of the rate or
perhaps even 1/16 of the right with no
difference to visual quality however by
shading at a lower rate performance
could be improved
anyway this feature is now available in
the latest version of Wolfenstein 2 and
the tech report have tested it it's
worth reading their entire article to
get a full description of how this tech
works and the full performance breakdown
but their benchmarking showed up to a 7
percent performance improvement with the
feature enabled for practically no
quality loss even using the performance
preset they gave the highest performance
uplift they're certainly very impressive
they're of course using this feature
requires developers to implement support
Nvidia are bundling battlefield 5 with
select GeForce r-tx graphics card
purchases if you buy an RT x 2080 TI r
TX 2080 or RT x 2070 between now and
January 7th 2019 at a participating
retail while stocks last you will
receive a game code for battlefield 5
that can be redeemed up until January
31st 2019
that's a nice value add to GeForce r-tx
cards if you happen to wanna play
battlefield 5 and also you don't already
clearly Nvidia are bundling this game
because it includes ray-tracing support
though I imagine most people play with
our Tex enabled for a few seconds before
disabling the feature and just enjoying
the very decent performance you'll get
in the game with invidious current
generation GPUs asa has unveiled seven
new k g1 gaming displays or with
apparently sub one millisecond response
times these displays do use TN panels to
achieve these types of responses and it
appears the metrics a Sura quoting do
refer to greater gray responses not
black frame insertion thanks specs or
anything like that
these monitors range from 0.5
milliseconds to 0.8 millisecond response
times depending on the exact model or
feature 1000 to 1 contrast ratios weak
viewing angles which is typical for a TN
and freesync brightness ranges between
250 and 400 nits again depending on the
model as for the exact 7 models the
lineup is split into three sizes a
single twenty three point six inch
display three twenty four point five
inches and three twenty seven inches the
twenty three point six
insure has a maximum 144 Hertz refresh
rate while the twenty four point five
and 27-inch variants are available in 75
144 and 240 Hertz models g.skill has
officially launched their Trident 0 l-r
gb memory they first announced at
Computex the ddr4 Ram is available from
3000 CL 16 speeds up to 4600 CL 18
speeds with the usual steps available in
between both 8 gigabyte and 16 gigabyte
modules are available in a variety of
kits the interesting thing about this
memory is the use of either shiny silver
or gold metal heat spreaders with a
crystal top section for shimmery RGB
effects certainly that'll add a bit of
bling for her that like bling in there
builds I guess no word on pricing for
the memory just yet but we expect it to
be G skills the most expensive memory in
their lineup final story from this week
and NVIDIA GeForce RT X 2060 was spotted
in the Final Fantasy 15 benchmark
database this could be affect entry or
it could legitimately be a card that's
in the works that someone accidentally
benchmark publicly in any case it's a
little unusual that the card is our TX
branded considering the Arctic's 2070
isn't really suitable for ray tracing as
it is I'd certainly hate to think how an
RT X 26
would perform with even more arty cores
removed from the equation maybe in video
just using our Tech's across their
entire lineup maybe this leak isn't a
legitimate leak if it turns out the
product is real the r-tx 2060 is
positioned just below the gtx 1070 in
the charts but handily above the gtx
1066 gigabyte so we'll see how that pans
out if the card ever comes out as an RT
X 2060 anyway that's it for this week's

news corner and instead cover other more
interesting stuff and then there was
that one week where I made two news
corners so well I guess just subscribe
