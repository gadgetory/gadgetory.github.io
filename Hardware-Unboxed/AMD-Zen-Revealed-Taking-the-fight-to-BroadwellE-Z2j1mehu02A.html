desktop enthusiast market you see that
the Zen CPU just edged out that broad
well II processor in that demo it's a
super exciting time the world is heck
right now especially if you're a gamer
this year we've seen the introduction of
nvidia is highly efficient and extremely
fast pascal architecture along with AMD
is sensible affordable plus 10 and 11
GPUs of course there's still much more
to come from AMD on the GPU front though
I feel many like myself or even more
Palmer for their upcoming Zen CPU
architecture the path to Zen has been a
long and arduous one mostly down to how
badly the FX series fizzled out and
Intel's less than aggressive pricing
strategy for their enthusiast chips if
you want an Intel processor with at
least six cause be prepared to pay
almost 400 US dollars or 550 ozzie for
an older generation has valley 5820k one
eight cores well stand up loosen your
belt and Bend well what I mean to say is
be prepared to spend at least a thousand
u.s. or over 1300 Aussie for the
privilege things get even worse with
Intel's latest generation Broadway Lee
processes my 69 50 X review was titled
Broadway lady bleeding enthusiast drive
so enough said there this is left pretty
much everyone banking on Zen to deliver
the goods and with IPC claims of 40%
greater performance than bulldozer were
expecting good things during an event
held in San Francisco and he finally
provided additional details regarding
Zen's architecture along with a few
other tidbits
the highlight of which was a
demonstration of their eight core 16
thread processor codenamed summit ridge
outperforming a similarly configured 8
core 16 thread in cell Broadway a
processor the processes were compared at
identical clock speeds of three
gigahertz using the multi-threaded
blender rendering software taking on the
cry 769 hundred K aim DS CPU was
reportedly able to render the scene in
about half a second faster than the
Intel chip AMD also conducted the first
public demonstration of its upcoming 32
cores 64 threads n base server processor
codenamed Naples in a dual processor
system running the Windows server
operating system what makes them so
exciting is that it's essentially a new
staff for aim D and should allow them to
move
the disaster that was the FX series this
clean-sheet approach is allowed AMD
designer new cache hierarchy improved
branch prediction as well as upgrade
their simultaneous multithreading
this in conjunction with multiple
architectural advances designed to
increase the performance throughput and
efficiency should see AMD once again
able to take the fight to Intel in fact
is that enabled CPUs should be able to
fight not only at the high end but also
scale down to meet the needs of a broad
range of applications including fanless
two-in-ones and embedded systems for
example adding to what we already know
about certain AMD confirmed the desktop
versions will utilize a new cache memory
hierarchy with 8 megabytes of l3 cache
in addition to an improved prefetcher
separate low latency l1 instruction and
data caches as well the larger unified
l2 cache much of the reason named is
bulldozer architecture struggled had to
do with slow caches of course as many of
you might have expected Zen is built on
the same 40 nanometer FinFET process as
their p'lice GPUs FinFETs are similar to
what Intel calls tri-gate or 3d
transistors aimday also added that it's
improved the instruction scheduler
window by 1.75 times then its execution
resources by one and a half times all
things considered then she provided
around 5 times the amount of bandwidth
to its core compared to previous designs
the only bad news here is that Zen has
been delayed until early 2017 though at
this point I think that just about
everyone a part of the idea of Zen for
Christmas expected to launch first the
Zen Bay summit ridge desktops will
utilize the AMD AM for socket this new
socket will unify AMD's platforms that
will also support seventh generation AMD
a-series desktop processors previously
codenamed bristol ridge interestingly
while Zen has been pushed back into next
year that am4 platform hasn't been the
first desktop systems featuring the
seventh gen a series ap use on the
brand-new am 4 socket is scheduled to
ship in the second half of 2016 in OEM
pcs
the updated am 4 platform is another
godsend for AMD fans as well as AMD
themselves having been uncompetitive for
so long in the CPU space motherboard
makers have been less interested in
developing new am 3 motherboards with no
new chipsets from AMD to support the
latest features the platform's become
very outdated am4 will change all that I
say a m4 and not its accompanying
chipsets because there shouldn't be a
chipset as such
Ridge isn't technically a CPU but rather
an SOC system-on-chip this means there's
no need for a chipset as most of the
functionalities built right into the
processor itself that said we could end
up seeing something like Intel's
platform controller hub for handling
certain features technologies such as
ddr4 memory PCIe gen3 USB 3 gen 2 nvme
storage and SATA Express will all be
supported by the processor not only that
but dedicated PCIe lanes for
cutting-edge USB graphics data and other
i/o will be provided by the processor so
their aim for platform will not steal
lanes from other devices and components
wrapping things up we still don't know
much about AMD's target clock speeds
thermal output pricing and so forth AMD
did say however that it plans to provide
additional details of next week's hot
chips conference so you should have some
juicy information they're not too
distant future for now though we can
pretty well rest on the comfort of
knowing that Xen is legit it's no longer
just a bunch of claims by AMD the demo
proved that summit ridge is the real
deal and can take the fight it entails
broad welly CPUs yeah I'm tingling
inside what do you guys think let me
know in the comments I'm your host Matt
