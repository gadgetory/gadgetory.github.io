video today we're going to be checking
out the new horizon 5 1600 X and 1500 X
CPUs to see how they compare with their
closest Intel rivals today AMD is
releasing a grand total of 4 new eyes
and 5 models though for this video we
will be just looking at two of them the
1600 X that we will be reviewing is
accompanied by a second six core part
the plain 1600 X which comes clocked
roughly just 10% lower but given all
rising sea views are unlocked they're
essentially the same product so while
the 1600 X is priced 250 us keep in mind
you should be able to achieve pretty
much the same performance out of the non
ex model for two hundred and twenty
dollars in either case the six core CPUs
will be doing battle with the core i5
7600 K or possibly the 210 dollar 9k
model but for this video we will be
focusing on the 7600 K then we have the
1500 X which sounds quite similar
especially given how the 1800 X and 1700
X are essentially the same CPU however
the 1600 X and 1500 X are very different
whereas the 1600 X is a 6 core part the
1500 X is actually a quad core it's
worth noting though that SMT is still
enabled so like a mainstream core i7 the
1500 X offers 4 cores with 8 threads I'm
not going to go into too much detail
here as we have already discussed the
Rison 5 specifications in a previous
video and I'll link up in the video
description rather than go over all that
again let's jump to the benchmark
results please note that the 1600 X was
tested with ddr4 3200 memory while these
fifteen hundred's has been downgraded to
29:33 memory the memory controller on my
1500 X chip that I received wasn't good
enough to handle 3200 memory so I was
forced to lower the memory speed
meanwhile the Intel lock chips were
tested using ddr4 3200 memory while the
locked model being the core i5 7500 was
tested using ddr4 2400 AMD has provided
a new test platform for our review
the Isuzu Prime be 350 plus motherboard
ddr4 3200 memory and a fresh install of
Windows on a samsung 90 Evo SSD
therefore I threw out all my previous
testing results for both the AMD and
Intel CPUs and started again from
scratch let's see what we found here we
see that memory bandwidth performance
has improved using the most up-to-date
bios on the Asuza
be 350 motherboard the Rison cpus are
now good for 35 gigabytes per second
previously we were seeing around 32
gigabytes per second with ddr4 29:33
memory this means even with lower rated
memory the Rison cpus are delivering at
least 10% more bandwidth than the kb
lake cpus this will hand the 1500 X a
massive advantage over the core i5 7500
in memory intensive workloads as it has
over 40% more bandwidth at its disposal
using Cinebench r15 to measure single
and multi-threaded performance we once
again find extremely impressive figures
from the rise and cpus the 1600 lays
waste to the 7600 case multi-threaded
score essentially doubling it that said
though for single workloads the higher
clock speed of the core i5 means the
1600 X is 11 percent slower here moving
to the 1500 X and we find this just 15%
slower than the 7700 K in the
multi-threaded test and 21% file when
looking at single threat of performance
however when compared to the similarly
priced 7500 the 1500 X was 45% fast from
the multi-threaded test and 6 percent
faster in the single threaded test so as
we found when testing horizon 7 this
points to Rison v offering vastly
superior productivity performance when
compared to competing Intel CPUs the
7-zip benchmark shows similar margins to
what we just saw in Cinebench r15 the
cool thing here however been that this
is a real-world application and the gain
T can be enjoyed by the average user
there are two tests here one measures
the performance when compressing files
to an archive for example and then
decompressing which basically measures
the performance when extracting from an
archive it's interesting to note that
intel's compression and decompression
performance is very similar however AMD
cpu is a much faster at decompression
than they are at compare
though to be fair they are anything but
slow it either
in fact the 1600 X crushes even the 7700
K in both tests it's 15% faster in
compressing and 44% faster and
decompressing then when compared to the
7600 K it's over twice as fast
when decompressing then we have the 1500
X which is over 60% faster than the 7500
in the decompression test this is
obviously a massive difference and the
vast majority of users will find
themselves doing much more decompression
work than they will compression so this
is a big win for Aizen the Monte Carlo
simulation is an old favourite and this
heavy excel workload crushers weak CPUs
it's also a great test for measuring
multi-threaded performance as it uses
all available threads we've seen it do a
good job of utilizing a Jules Leon
configuration with 40 threads I realize
that most of you watching this video are
more interested in gaming performance
than heavy spreadsheet work but this is
a good indicator of real-world
performance in applications that utilize
multiple threads here we see the 1600 X
is 10% faster than the 7700 K and 62
percent faster than the 7600 okay
meanwhile the 1500 X was 20% slower than
the 77 okay but 18% faster than the 7600
K and 61% faster than the 7500 so when
compared to similarly priced Intel CPUs
Rison 5 delivered around 60% more
performance in this application finally
before jumping to the games let's check
out Premiere Pro CC this is a different
workload to my previous Premiere Pro
tests it's still a 4k video export but
we have reduced the length of the video
to speed up the time that the test takes
the 1600 X took two hundred and
forty-one seconds to complete the
workload making it 31 percent faster
than the core i5 7600 K meanwhile the
1500 X match the 7600 K making it 22%
faster than the 7500 so another
excellent application result for AMD now
for the games and this is where things
tend to get a bit messy with Rison first
up we have battlefield 1 and here both
the 1800 X and 1600 x fall short of the
7600 case 153 FPS average however if we
look at the minimum frame rate both are
faster than the 70
600k in fact here the 1800 x match the
69 okay
while the 1600 X was just 4% slower the
1500 X on the other hand loses out to
the core i5 7,500 for both the minimum
and average framerate still it is
possible to overclock the 1500 x4
greater performance and we will look
into this later in the review Deus Ex
mankind divided has been tested using
the dx11 API at 1080p with the higher
quality preset here the 1600 X matches
the performance of the 1800 X though
unfortunately both are slower than the
72 Turner okay almost 10% slower in fact
when comparing the minimum frame rate
that said the 1500 X makes out quite a
bit better beating the lock 7,500 by a
slim margin the GX 11 hitman results are
very competitive for the 1600 X and 1500
X which is great as the 1800 X didn't
fare too well against the 7700 K or 6000
okay at least when looking at the
average frame rate I should know that
the minimum results were very good
moving on the 1600 X roughly match the
7600 okay while the 1500 was a good bit
faster than the 7500 so a great result
for the 1500 X here the plan was to
include mafia 3 to showcase how well
Rosen can perform in some games
previously this was a title where risin
7 processors did very well even beating
the 7700 K under certain conditions
however this retest shows the 1,800 X to
be quite far behind the 7700 K something
has changed with this title the 1,800 X
has taken a big hit particularly to the
minimum frame rate and the same is also
true for the 6900 K on the other hand
though the 7700 K has gained quite a few
extra frames so it seems some
optimization must have been done to make
this title less demanding on the CPU
though this could be down to
improvements made by invidious display
driver at this point I'm just not sure I
believe the game was patched last week
but there was no mention of any
performance changes the Nvidia driver
has also been heavily updated since the
previous testing was conducted
but improvements were mostly made to
DirectX 12 performance so I was
expecting the 1600 X to easily beat the
7600 K here and for the 1500 X to
demolish the 7500 rather the performance
was very competitive amongst these
processors
and again something must have changed
here moving to ashes of the singularity
we see that the 1800 X is able to close
in on the 7700 K for the normal batch
test that said it does flip away in the
heavy batch test moving to the new
horizon five models and we see the 1600
X looking very competitive alongside the
7600 K meanwhile the 1500 X has no
trouble dispatching the locked core i5
7500 providing almost 10 percent more
performance in the normal batch test so
another strong result for AMD is new
affordable quad core cpu I know there
are a few viewers who will write me over
the coals if I don't include any AMD GPU
testing I'm sure you guys want to see
our X 480 crossfire testing but right
now I can't do that still the r9 295x2
should deliver similar results that
being said I instantly wish I never
bothered testing with ashes of the
singularity and a few other titles such
as Davis X mankind divided delivered
very disappointing results I want to
show you the ashes testing the debut
sects findings were even worse for the
rise on CPUs oddly the core i5 7500 was
quite a bit faster with the r9 290 5
while the 1500 X was quite a bit slower
anyway I promise I'll revisit the AMD
GPU testing in extreme depth once vaguer
arrives when it came time to overclock
we found that our 1600 X sample was good
for 4.1 gigahertz while the 1500 X
sample hit the wall at 3.9 5 gigahertz
testing with premier pros or the 1600 X
boosts performance by 9 percent once
overclocked making it slightly faster
than the stock core i7 77 ok and not
much slower than the stock 1800 X the
1500 X performance on the other hand was
improved by just 4% and this was a
disappointing result mostly because
overclocking the 7600 K led to an 18%
improvement taking just 269 seconds to
complete the workload that said the 7600
K is a more expensive CPU and requires a
third party cooler as well when compared
to the similarly priced Core i5 7500 the
overclocked 1,500 X was 28% faster so
that is another strong result for AMD
the overclocked 1600 X squeezed out a
few more frames in battle to the one
though the result wasn't worth getting
excited over the 1500 X on the other
hand was a
or more impressive here and the
overclock did allow it to just outpace
the core i5 7500 here the 1600 x-games
6% more performance and ashes of the
singularity once overclocked allowing it
to beat the overclock to 7500 K at least
when comparing the average framerate
meanwhile the 1500 X is now 14 percent
faster than 7500 hitting 73 FPS on
average so again a good result for the
1500 X looking at the power consumption
figures when running the Cinebench r15
multi-threaded test I have to say the
rise in cpus don't look particularly
fuel-efficient the 1600 X push total
system consumption 64 percent higher
than that of the core i5 7600 K however
here we need a bit more context remember
the 1600 X was almost 100 percent faster
in this test so increasing total system
consumption by just 64 percent to
deliver twice the performance is
actually very impressive the 1500 X
wasn't quite as good as its
configuration consumes 66% more power
while it was only 45% faster still not a
bad result though the 1500 X does look
quite inefficient in this test when
compared to 7700 K here we have the
maximum power consumption figures for
the Excel tests as well as the system
idle figures as you can see the idle
results are all much the same hovering
around 60 to 70 watts again the power
consumption figures on their own are a
bit misleading
here the 1600 X can be seen pushing
system consumption 34% higher than that
of the 7600 K configuration and that
looks pretty bad
you'd complete the test 62 percent
faster so while it consumed more power
it completed the test much faster
actually making it the more efficient
processor here the same is true for the
1500 X it consumed 33% more power than
the 7500 while delivering 61% more
performance as is often the case power
efficiency goes right out the window
once you start overclocking and
increasing voltages if you carry around
efficiency then overclocking rise and
fire processors might not be a desirable
option the performance gains were quite
slim and yet we see the 1600 X increased
total system consumption by a staggering
49% hard to believe but it's true the
1500 X increased consumption by a more
reasonable 30 percent
at best we only saw about half that
margin in performance games by the way
this power-hungry overclocking stuff
isn't just an issue on AMD side the 7600
case sucked down 42% more power once
overclocked but we only saw performance
gains of up to 20% now for the operating
temperatures using the stock AMD coolers
actually I should note that the risin 5
overclocking was done using the race
spire for the 1500 X and the Wraith max
for the 1600 X but I will talk more
about CPU coolers more towards the end
of the video out of the box the 1500 X
are 35 degrees and peaked at 68 degrees
when using the Wraith spire overclocked
to 3.9 5 gigahertz those temperatures
did shoot up quite a bit the idle was
now at 42 degrees but it was a load temp
of 88 degrees which was getting a bit
roasty that said the heatsink wasn't
uncomfortable touch and while Oliver fan
wasn't screaming loud the 1600 X pimp
with the Wraith max addled at 36 degrees
and maxed out at 61 degrees at the stock
frequencies that's that when
overclocking it did hit 90 degrees under
load so that's getting a bit too hot in
my opinion though keep in mind I'm using
a power bug type program to stress the
CPU so in gaming you won't see
temperatures get nearly as high as these
for the most part keep in mind though
while the 1600 does come with the Wraith
spire the 1600 X that we have for
testing here doesn't come with a cooler
at all for this reason I strongly
suggest buying the cheaper 1600 over the
1600 X of course if you are going to
seriously overclock either 6 core model
you're probably better off investing in
a large tower style cooler or an
all-in-one liquid cooler these are of
course mandatory items for the core i5
7600 K okay so now to make sense of the
data and try and work out which CPU it
is you guys should buy in my opinion
priced at $250 us the 1600 X is an
exceptionally good buy and a fantastic
alternative to Intel's Core i5 7600 K
the problem with the 7600 K is that for
the same price you do only get four
cores
granted they are exceptionally good
cause that can be pushed quite high
through overclocking and in most games
they are very efficient but it is still
just a quad core as good as the 7600 K's
gaming performance is the 6
300x still offered more consistent
performance in games such as battlefield
1 and of course he although the averages
were lower we were still pushing over
120 FPS at all times it also made out
better in ashes of the singularity
escalation and provided similar
performance in a hitman even in games
such as Mafia 3 and Deus Ex mankind
divided where the 1600 x-trail to 7600 K
the margin wasn't exactly significant so
out of the box gaming performance right
now is very similar what isn't similar
is the productivity performance it
really doesn't matter what the
application is there will be hundreds
that mimic what we saw in 7-zip and
Excel for example for content creation
the 1600 X is a beast at the price point
roughly matching the 7700 K even if we
take overclocking performance into
account the 7600 K can't live with the
1600 X when it comes to productivity
likewise once more games start to
utilize horizon as well as these
applications are the 7600 K is going to
be left well behind for me rosen v also
feels much more like an enthusiast grade
product thanks to the unlocked clock
multiplier overclocking support on not
just the flagship chipset but also the
Affordable B 350 and of course that
impressive box cooler for the 1600 X
which offers quite a bit of overclocking
Headroom on the contrary the 7600 K
requires a reasonably expensive flagship
Zed Series chipset if you plan to
overclock and don't forget there's no
box cooler at all that's right you're
paying more for an unlocked a model and
Intel does you the favor by keeping the
medal so right away you can tack on
around another 20 to 30 dollars us on to
the price tag for a basic air cooler
there's also around a $20 premium for
the motherboard as well if we combine
the CPU price entry-level motherboard
supporting overclocking and the cooler
we find the 1600 X actually ends up
costing 8 percent less than the 7600 K
combo and not the four percent more
you'd pay for just the CPUs of course if
you opt for the vanilla 1600 like I
suggest then you're saving a little over
15% on the core components that's pretty
insane for a 12 thread setup opposed to
a quad core if you thought the 60 100x
seemed like a pretty obvious choice then
sit down the 1500 X is
no brainer you might think quad cores in
2017 are old news and well they kind of
are
however with its SMT support the four
core eight thread 1500 X does very well
for itself and at just 190 us it's
exceptional value the alternates around
the same money or the core i5 7400 or
the 7500 which we tested and as you just
saw the 1500 X had no trouble
dispatching Intel's budget quad core for
gaming they were quite evenly match for
the most part though of course at no
additional cost the 1500 X can be
overclocked while it's impossible to
squeeze any more performance out of the
locked Intel chip again when it came to
productivity workloads the 1500 X was in
a different league as I said when
discussing the 1600 X the 1500 X really
is a chip that will be appreciated by
enthusiasts as it can be overclocked and
can take advantage of faster memory
something else I should also quickly
note is that gaming performance will
also be considerably more competitive
with a mid-range to high-end graphics
card something like the rx 480 or gtx
1060 up to say the gtx 1070 the upshot
being that in cpu-bound games rise and
will still have an advantage thanks to
its additional resources and therefore
in those situations we'll pull ahead of
the 7600 k overall I think I am more
impressed with the risin 5 Series than I
was a month earlier with Rison 7 for the
simple fact that there is less
competition at these price points
Intel has done a pretty poor job of
looking after enthusiasts particularly
those on a budget and this is where
these new Rison 5 chips really hit hard
this makes me think how incredible the
Rison 3 range is going to be in terms of
value you might stop at 130 to 150
dollar u.s. quad core that lacks SMT
support but remember the upgrade party
is very rich
the a m4 motherboard that you purchased
today should still be able to support
AMD processors all the way to 2020 at
least that's the plan so the option to
move from an affordable quad core that
you buy today to something much more
substantial or at least capable in a few
years time should be possible and this
is the reason why I'm so keen on the
1500 X and that brings me to the end of
my released day rise and 5 coverage hope
you guys enjoyed it and remember if you
want to get your hands on an incredibly
cool custom-built Rison 7 game
see then be sure to enter our
competition I'll throw the link in the
video description below there's also
more isin 5 coverage to come on their
channel so this will not be the end of
it I now have the 1600 and 1400 on hand
so expect to see some testing done on
them soon I'm a host Eve catch again
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
