video is a bit of a follow-up to the
coverage we did a couple of weeks ago on
the first windows on arm devices in that
video which you should definitely check
out we benchmark the snapdragon 835
running windows in both emulated x86
apps and native uwp apps comparing it to
a range of other processes in this video
we'll be revisiting some of those
benchmarks but we'll be mostly looking
more closely at the first snapdragon 835
device running Windows the HP Envy x2
having now used this tablet for a couple
of weeks there's a lot of things HP did
well to make this a hardware experience
to rival the surface and then on the
other hand they probably were a bit let
down by the performance of x86 emulation
on ARM processors
so the key piece of hardware in the enve
x2 is the snapdragon 835 however HP has
packed in several other decent
components the display is a twelve point
three inch 1920 by 1200 IPS LCD there's
a decent 41.6 watt hour battery and
you'll get either four gigabytes of RAM
and 128 gigabytes of storage or eight
gig of ram and 256 gig of storage
depending on the configuration and
region in the United States the four
gigabyte model is what you'll get while
here in Australia we have the 8 gig very
unlike with basically every Windows
tablet except the surface both the
keyboard cover and stylus are included
in the box for no additional charge for
some reason Microsoft is still able to
charge nearly $200 extra for these
accessories which just blows my mind
HP's Windows on um device is the most
premium of the devices and now so far
while the seuss and lenovo targeted more
mid-range offerings the nvx to screams
in at the top with a full metal
construction and an eye-watering $1,000
price tag the pricing of this tablet
will be examined fully a bit later on so
for now let's discuss the design and
construction of this tablet
according to Qualcomm both HP and Lenovo
opted to use several elements of
Qualcomm z-- windows on RF
it's designed for their devices despite
this the final build of the Envy x2 is
fantastic it looks excellent with metal
on all sides and Gorilla Glass
protecting the display and the nice
seamless construction gives it that
premium touch you'd expect from a
top-end tablet the Envy x2 is also quite
thin and light for a Windows device it's
just 7.7 millimeters thick and a touch
under 700 grams heavy however that's
perhaps not as impressive when you
realize the surface pro is 8.5 mm thick
and around 770 grams heavy yet it also
integrates a kickstand into the body it
features a fully fledged intel core
processor and you get a slightly larger
battery still the Envy x2 feels great to
hold and the silver metal design is of a
similar quality to HP's flagship laptops
like the spectre x360 there's enough
bezel around the display to make the
tablet usable in a handheld fashion
without absolutely overwhelming the
screen with bezel and the twelve point
three inch display feels like a suitable
size for this sort of tablet and I like
the 16:10 aspect ratio the IO selection
on this tablet is pretty slim at just
one USB 3.1 type C port and a headphone
jack
it's nice than charges via USB C but if
you want to charge it and use a
peripheral at the same time you'll have
to buy a dongle luckily HP does include
a USB c2a dongle for just basic
peripheral use but again you know if you
want to actually charge and use a device
you'll have to purchase something
separately while you don't get many USB
ports on this tablet you do get both a
micro SD card slot and a nano SIM slot
thanks to the Snapdragon 835 you'll get
an integrated Snapdragon x16 LTE modem
in the enve x2 so you can chuck in a sim
and enjoy the internet wherever you go
I'd really do wish more laptops had
integrated LTE support and with Windows
on arm you can guarantee you're getting
that feature in pretty much all the
devices we'll see the keyboard cover
attaches to the nvx to using magnets and
pins so nothing too unusual however as
the stand is integrated into the cover
rather than the tablet itself there are
a couple more steps to get the tablet
set up in the cover then with the
simplest surface style kickstand design
the way The Stand folds back over itself
is a unique take and does allow a wide
range of angles there
for a standard laptop style ankle it's
not as quick and easy to use as with the
surface having the stand attached to the
keyboard also means you can't prop up
just the tablet alone
if the stand was integrated into the
tablet body the nvx two strengths is a
media consumption device could be made
even stronger
you know prop up the tablet watch a
video and enjoy outstanding battery life
but as you'll need to bring along the
keyboard to use the stand this sort of
experience is a bit diminished the good
news is the keyboard itself is excellent
it has a great tactile clicky response
the keys are a decent size for typing
and there's not a significant amount of
flex in their cover while smashing out a
word document it's very similar to the
keyboards on HP's fully fledged laptops
in this regard and the track that is
also quite good and works well
considering the limited space allocated
to it HP has also done quite well with
the display the twelve point three inch
1920 by 1200 LCD isn't anything special
from a spec perspective but its
performance exceeded my expectations
it's capable of a high level of
brightness around 500 nits plus it
features a decent contrast ratio of 1415
to 1 and great viewing angles as well it
does have a content-aware automatic
brightness feature though it's not too
aggressive and helps conserve energy
where possible the key aspect that
impressed me is its calibration Delta
easing the 2.4 to 2.8 range aren't quiet
in the realm of very accurate however it
is much better than a lot of other
Windows laptops and should suffice for
those that want to do some light content
creation or more likely on this sort of
device view photos and an average
temperature of 7,000 K isn't surprising
but it's not terrible either the main
downside to the Envy x2 is undoubtedly
the performance as I mentioned in my
previous coverage of the Snapdragon 835
running Windows at best you'll get an
entry-level experience and at worst
you'll be struggling through downright
terrible performance in emulated x86
apps the Snapdragon 835 is a low-power
processor with weak single core
performance so this level of performance
isn't all that surprising looking at our
benchmark results in native apps like
edge you can expect performance above an
atom based Celeron processor from Intel
but below most of Intel's Core
processors from the past three to four
years you're just not going to get Core
i5 performance Intel provides that a 5
to 15 watt envelope in a sub 3 watt TDP
the ability to emulate x86 apps on an
ARM architecture is certainly impressive
especially at this TDP but it's not
something that actually recommend users
do the Celeron n 3451 of intel slowest
x86 processes is significantly faster in
most x86 workloads while the low-power
core i7 7 y7 v absolutely obliterates it
and apps just feel sluggish to use which
isn't what you'd want from a premium
tablet on top of this you're faced with
many limitations the Snapdragon 835
can't run 64-bit x86 apps it doesn't
support x86 drivers it doesn't support
OpenGL newer than 1.1 and apps that
customize windows may not work at all
it's still very early days for x86
emulation on arm but for most use cases
it really is a break glass in case of
emergency sort of thing right now being
limited to Windows Store you WP apps for
decent enough native performance will be
fine for a small handful of users that
like using edges of browser or want to
watch videos and are fine with other
basic apps and games but if you're used
to using Chrome or want to use
productivity apps like Microsoft Office
Adobe Photoshop or really anything else
built for Windows desktops emulated x86
performance isn't going to cut it
especially when there are so many
productivity tablets out there that use
Intel processors that run x86 apps just
fine the nvx to storage performance
isn't particularly amazing either the
SATA SSD isn't going to break any speed
records and while that's fine
considering the rest of the device's
performance something a bit faster would
have been nice in a high-end tablet
there is good news though
while performance is limited battery
life is excellent from this tablet
whether you're using native arm apps or
emulated x86 apps the battery capacity
is just 41 watt hours which is mid-range
for a tablet of this size but the
efficiency of the Snapdragon 835 allows
it to beat almost every device in our
patch
tests in our web-browsing test the nvx -
dominates most other devices with
outstanding battery life even while
using chrome switch to edge which is a
more sensible option as it runs natively
and the nvx - pulls even further ahead
than other devices running chrome
natively either way you look at it
that's a great result for this device
video playback is another strong area
for their Envy x2 though other devices
are a bit more competitive here is 1080p
playback these days is a bit limited by
the efficiency of the display still
getting 14 and a half hours of playback
at quite high levels of brightness is
very good turn down the brightness and
you should be able to hit HP stated 19
our figure I also tested a PC mark
battery life which again is excellent
though naturally most other devices in
this chart perform a lot of better in
terms of the cpu performance the
Snapdragon 835 does consume less power
but it also is a fair bit slower in the
process we know some devices do have a
few other battery related advantages
standby battery life is excellent with
very little battery drain while in sleep
mode and wake times in the instant we
know as hello performance is also much
quicker than Intel laptops I've tested
which did surprise me a little bit and
you'll also get reasonably fast charging
with the Envy x2 however despite a great
battery life it's difficult to recommend
the Envy x2 for a number of reasons the
key factor in all of them is the price a
thousand US dollars is just too much to
pay for this tablet HP is effectively
going head-to-head with similar products
like the Microsoft Surface pro and the
Eevee which offer full Intel Core
processors and consequently provide much
better performance in an equivalent form
factor I think HP made a mistake in
developing a high-end tablet body to go
with the entry-level performance of the
Snapdragon a 35 the design is beautiful
in the Envy x2 packs a lot of decent
features but it doesn't make a lot of
sense to pair this metal design with a
weak processor and charge top-end
pricing for the package because as it
stands there really is no way I'd
recommend the Envy x2 over similarly
priced surface pro that offers five
times the performance in x86 apps
unfortunately the Snapdragon 835 only
makes sense
entry-level products priced below $500 I
can't see the Envy x2 getting a 50%
price cut anytime soon but that's what
it would take to be a solid buy it's a
shame too because if HP had chucked an
Intel Y Series CPU in this chassis
suddenly you'd have a really compelling
product while this first Snapdragon 835
Windows Device isn't all that impressive
I don't think the entire platform is
dead after one wave of releases if
Qualcomm and mercs off work on removing
some of the platform limitations allow
the use of newest Snapdragon processors
and encourage companies to make entry
level devices price more appropriately
Intel and AMD could have a serious
competitor in the sub $500 budget market
but right now Windows on arm really
won't succeed as a high-end product
