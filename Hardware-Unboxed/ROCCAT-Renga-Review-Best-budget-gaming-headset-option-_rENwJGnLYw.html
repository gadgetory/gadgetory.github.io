specific headsets available with
seemingly every peripheral and even
mainboard manufacturer entering the fray
an area where I still see a lot of
potential is in the budget price range
most of the best value headsets coming
in around 120 US dollar range this is a
really clear winner around 70 to 80
dollars this is where the brand new
rocket brain guy aims to make its mark a
first inspection there's no way to tell
that the Wrangler is a fairly
inexpensive headset and its appearance
reminded me a little of the Plantronics
big range though with a simpler design
like the weak 500 the ringer features a
self-adjusting headband made of a faux
leather plastic this headband is wide
really wide in fact and this actually
helps to spread the light weight of the
ringer across a broader surface area on
your head this lightweight headband is
held in a rubber coated aluminium wire
frame which in combination offer what
must be one of the least weighty
implementations on any headset certainly
any I've seen these reach down on either
side and attached around joiners one of
which carries the permanently attached
microphone while the other way is the
Rocket logo at first I thought these may
have joined to the ear cuffs themselves
with some sort of rotating ball joint
for an absolutely perfect fit however on
closer inspection they're simply
attached with a hinge joint which is
fairly standard even a more expensive
headsets at the other end of these
hinges are the rather unique ear cups
while you'll first notice about these
ear cups is just how open their open
design is between the cushioning frame
and drivers of very large spaces the
layout sound and air in and out this is
great for those to get hot and sweaty
under the headphones I can't imagine a
headset offering better ventilation than
these they're also great for those who
need to also be able to hear what's
going on around them if you're at work
or in some sort of gaming team and need
to hear the person next to you talk then
the Wrangler is great is you definitely
don't need to pull them on and off to
hear what's happening around you this
will mean though they're quite useless
for playing train and bus rides in fact
for commuting these headphones are
pretty much the opposite of what you
want well they don't look ugly they
aren't exactly stylish by hipster
definition and they're letting all sound
around you the microphone isn't
removable and they are particularly loud
they do however feature an inline remote
and an adapter to a single four pole
three and a half
millimeter jack for plugging into a
smartphone Ultrabook or console the
sound from the 50 millimeter neodymium
drivers is good for the price out of the
box they're definitely suited to vocals
offering crisp eye and and very clear
overall sound
the bass is a little lacking however and
I'd say the mid-range lacks a little too
so if you're wanting a great music
experience as well they aren't the best
this is of course not aided by their
very open design either the mic is
pretty standard stuff I think a
windshield would have been a nice
addition and what's essentially a budget
microphone on a budget headset you can
hear it now I've made new tweaks at all
to the sounds simply plug them in and
recorded and this is how the mic sounds
connected through my Sound Blaster XG 5
there sounded quite a bit better to
those using an external docking amp will
have a better experience as per usual
comfort wise the Ranga headset is very
good they're extremely lightweight as
mentioned which goes a long way they
weren't wear on you much at all as a
result during long gaming sessions they
also don't grip too hard around you had
the ear cups a circular and they were
just big enough to fit my ears inside
with a small amount of squishing so they
earn the overhear classification for me
if only just overall the ringer headset
from rocket is a very good entry to the
budget gaming headphone market coming in
at just forty seven dollars fifty on
amazon in the USA and personally $100 in
australia however i'd expect this price
to drop as they become more widely
available in the region the render
offers good comfort quite good sound for
the price range and an extremely
lightweight build the venture design
will suit specific people and not those
who are after an isolating experience at
all if you're looking for a comfortable
headset that takes most of the important
boxes that a very low price point in the
states then the ring will make a solid
purchase thanks for tuning in again to
hardware own box i'm your host Matt as
always and I'll see you guys next time
