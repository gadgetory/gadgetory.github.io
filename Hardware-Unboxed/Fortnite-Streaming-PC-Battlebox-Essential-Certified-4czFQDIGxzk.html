going to check out what I believe will
be a very impressive pre-built system
from PC case cube now please note this
content has been sponsored by PC case
gear just want to be very clear about
that
but this is a pre-built system that I
can honestly say I would recommend I've
tested almost every component in this
system and there's absolutely nothing
that I would have trouble recommending
before we can take a closer look at all
the bits inside play some games all that
sort of stuff we do need to unbox it or
sort of in this case unpackage it so
let's do that first
okay so we have a nice clean build here
and PC case key caught the eclipse 1060
gaming system and well that's because it
is in the fantex Eclipse p400s tempered
glass case and it's sports and NVIDIA
GeForce GTX 1066 gigabyte graphics card
now you'll have likely noticed a little
badge down here on the tempered glass
side panel and that means the Eclipse
1060 gaming is a certified Nvidia battle
box and it's actually one of the few
certified battle box essential gaming
pcs that are available in Australia
right now and for those of you who don't
know and video did create the battle box
certification to ensure gamers that what
they were buying was ready for battle
although I obviously prefer to build my
own pcs I know many of you do as well I
certainly understand that not everyone
wants to invest time research and
components then going through the
process of building their own game Eirik
for those that just want to lay down
some cash and in return get something
that's ready for action
there is the pre-built having said that
not all pre-built systems are built
equally and I've come across plenty of
gamers in my time that have defected
from consoles or they're just getting
into PC gaming for the first time and
they've made the mistake of buying an
expensive gaming system only to find
that while it does have an expensive
core i7 processor it's paired with an
entry-level graphics card and you
certainly can't blame novice users for
seeing core i7 and geforce on the specs
list and just believing they're set this
is where the battle box certification
comes in there are two types of battle
boxes the ultimate and the essential the
essential is what we have here and it
calls for a minimum of a core i5 or
Verizon 5 CPU at least 8 gigabytes of
ddr4 memory and SSD Windows 10 and a
g-sync display if the system comes with
a display so any retailer selling a
battle box essentials must meet or
exceed those specifications so what's in
our system from PC case key then the
brains of the operation
is a core i5 8500 a close relative to
the much-loved 8400 the model I recently
named the best value mid-range gaming
CPU the i5 8,500 is plugged into a very
sensible a soos prime a b-36 tmk
motherboard which offers important
features such as USB 3.1 gen2 and a
full-speed m2 port which is being used
and I'll get to that in a moment the
only downside to this motherboard is the
fact that it only packs two DIMM slots
that said the four dimm slot
does cost four dollars more and offers
very little in the way of extra features
so I understand why PC case key made
this choice also cooling the i-5 8,500
is the included box cooler so it will be
interesting to see what thermals look
like we've seen no throttling issues
with the 8400 previously so shouldn't be
an issue then for the memory we have
some team force nighthawk ddr4 3000
memory and of course we do have 8
gigabytes for the boot drive we have the
a data XP g sx 6000 nvm a 256 gigabyte
SSD and that has been installed along
with some secondary storage a much
larger Seagate Barracuda 2 terabyte
drivers also included oh and of course
we also have the nvidia geforce gtx 1066
gear bike reverse card and the exact
model being used is the isuzu dual fan
OC the gtx 1060 really needs no
introduction at this point if you
haven't seen my countless benchmark
videos featuring it then really what
have you been doing with your time put a
link in the video description if you
want to go check those results out
anyway we've unboxed to the battle box
and it's now time to do some battle and
see what this thing's really capable of
ideally the system is intended for a DP
high refresh rate gaming but it can
handle title such as fortnight for
example using competitive settings at
1440p without any issues as luck would
have it the Isuzu rog swift PG 27 uq a
brand new 4k 144 hertz gsync HDR 27 inch
display was sent to me by mistake and
will be going out to Tim tomorrow for an
in-depth review but in the meantime I
thought we could take it out of the box
and have a bit of a play of course we
won't be taking advantage of that 4k
resolution but still it should look
pretty spectacular even at 1080
hey I plan to play a bit of fortnight
pub G the crew two Star Wars Battlefront
two and Far Cry five then I'm going to
test out these streaming performance of
the rig when playing fortnight's that
should be interesting now this isn't
something we've done on the channel
before so I'm keen to see how the core
i5 8,500 and geforce gtx 1060 combo
stream before any that though first that
we do have fortnight's 50 verse 50 mode
at 1080p using mostly competitive
settings so no shadows epic draw
distance and everything else pretty much
set to high we saw an average of one
hundred and 60 FPS and a minimum of 104
fps after 10 minutes a gameplay frame
time performance was also excellent and
the 0.1% low figure never dipped below
73 FPS so again nice smooth stuff there
the 50 V 50 mode is pretty heavy on the
CPU at least compared to the solo duo
and squad modes but even so the core i5
8500 had plenty of headroom for stream
II which again we will look at shortly
for now let's take a closer look at how
the game ran and then move on to check
out pub G
has to be said I'm still not really a
fan of pub G but anyway my personal
preferences aside I know there are
others of you that will want to know how
the Eclipse 1060 gaming system handles
this title so here we are again testing
takes place at 1080p and for this one
I've just left the quality settings
maxed out on the ultra preset using
these settings I saw around 70 FPS on
average with a minimum of about 60 fps
so for pub G I think that's pretty good
next up we have the crew - and this
title is locked at 60fps using the
maximum in-game quality settings at
1080p the core i5 8,500 and geforce gtx
1060 combo had no issue hitting the
60fps cap so a nice smooth experience
and the game does look very good
star wars battlefront 2 is another great
looking title that's both very CPU and
GPU demanding playing the arcade mode at
1080p using the ultra quality settings
allowed for an average of around 90 FPS
with a minimum of just 75 FPS again
another nice smooth enjoyable game
experience was hard
alter their attention
turn it out
then finally I jumped in a far cry 5 and
ran him lessly around the countryside
sniping anything that moved
at 1080p using the opto quality preset
the Eclipse 1060 gaming system averaged
around 80 FPS with dips as low as 50 fps
still for the most part we were seeing
over 60 FPS so very smooth stuff indeed
okay so we've played a few games now but
what if you want a live stream while
playing games can that be done with the
Eclipse 1060 gaming system more
specifically can we stream fortnight on
this system in short yes we can
assuming we're willing to compromise on
quality which honestly you have to do on
just about any system without a second
dedicated streaming rig without the live
stream up and running we were seeing 150
FPS on average a 1% low of 123 fps and a
0.1% low result of 111 FPS using the
GeForce GTX 1060 GPU to encode we saw
very little impact on performance and
the same was also true for the ultra
fast CPU preset however the ultra fast
super fast very fast and faster presets
are all noticeably worse in terms of
visual quality than the GPU encoder it's
not until we get down to the fast CPU
and code preset that we see a similar
level of quality to that of the GPU and
code but the problem is here we do
suffer noticeable and very regular
stuttering so unless you have a crazy
high-end system or more ideally a
dedicated streaming rig it looks like
the GeForce GTX 1060 is the best option
for budding streamers
anyway Tim is going to look into this in
much more depth next month so keep an
eye out for that content for someone
just getting into PC gaming who doesn't
have a huge amount of money to spend
getting a battle box essential certified
PC like the Eclipse 1060 gaming is a
surefire way to know you're getting
something very capable the GeForce GTX
1060 and Core i5 8400 really are a great
value gaming combo that said PC case key
has told me they're working on an even
better deal which should be available at
the start of the week and will come in
and around $100 less or at least they're
hoping it'll come in at $100 less and
you really want to look out for that one
because it will be featuring a rise in
520 600 and of course it will be a
battle box essential certified PC using
a b3 15 motherboard and of course a
geforce gtx 1066 gigabyte graphics card
for the core i5 version i have priced up
all the components individually and it
looks like you're only paying pc case
care about a hundred and fifty dollars
to build
configure the system for you and I have
to say they do a very nice job of that
the cable management is just amazing on
both sides even the backside it's just
very clean they've done a fantastic job
with these systems something else I'd
like to add is that this system does
come with an in-house two-year warranty
from PC case Kia and that covers things
like parts all the labor involved with
any repairs or whatever needs to happen
with the system and quite incredibly
they will also cover the cost of
shipping both ways so for you to send
the system back to them for repairs and
then once repaired back to you so that's
quite incredible and you can also extend
that to a 3-year warranty period for
extra hundred dollars if you wanted to
and I'm not making a big deal about this
service guy I genuinely think it's quite
incredible I realize this is a sponsored
video but PC case key hasn't provided
any talking points for this content and
I'm certainly not being forced to bring
this up I just think it's quite
incredible that you're getting that
provided by default a two-year in-house
warranty with everything I just
mentioned I'm honestly impressed that
from mere $150 or a 10% markup then only
providing a clean bill that's fully
configured and ready to go but they're
also offering to cover any costs of
hardware failures and stuff like that if
you've ever built your own PC like I'm
sure many of you have and you've had to
RMA a component which I'm sure many of
you had to do that as well you'll
appreciate just how much of a big deal
what PC case gear are offering
especially for such a small fee overall
the system worked exceptionally well the
frame rates were nice silky smooth
gameplay temperatures were good the
system was very quiet when gaming so
overall a great package here having said
all that I strongly advise you look at
the horizon 5 model that should be
available next week so shortly after
this video goes live so check that out
there may be an even better buy there
anyway I hope you enjoyed the video and
a big thank you to PC case gear for
supporting the channel once again if you
came to check out their pre-built
systems I'll provide a link in the video
description so you can jump over there
and hopefully better find that Verizon 5
version as well thanks for watching I'm
your host Steve see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
