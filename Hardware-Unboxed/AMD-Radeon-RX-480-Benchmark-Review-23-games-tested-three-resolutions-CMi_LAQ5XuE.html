1080 and gtx 1070 reignited the GPU
debate in a big way performance-wise
these new Pasco GPUs are immensely
impressive particularly when it came to
efficiency as drool-worthy is the
benchmark results were for most gamers
and videos new high performance GPUs are
irrelevant it's a bit like when Ferrari
announced a new car granted on a much
lesser scale by that I mean you can
enjoy watching the Top Gear boys slide
it around sideways on an airstrip but
that's about as close as you get to
ownership well you ultimately end up
with is the reasonably priced car a
graphics card just capable of delivering
performance needed to enjoy the latest
games at reasonable quality settings
with the RX 480
AMD wants to take the reasonably priced
car carry out some weight reduction dump
it on its guts and give it a shot of
nitrous the result being a 200 each
dollar GPU not a car capable of
delivering very playable 1440p
performance in all the latest games in
an effort to try and steal some of them
videos thunder last month
AMD were keen to announce their upcoming
Radian rx4i d graphics card during
Computex the highlights included the
$200 price tag and strong hints of
greatness in terms of performance
now this price announcement definitely
generated a heap of speculation as to
what the resulting performance would be
I won't cover the rx for 80 specs and
reference card in this video for that
information please check out this video
here I know you're all very keen to get
right into the benchmarks so I'll make
this quick now as always you guys can
find all the graphs at the hardware box
website which will be linked in the
description after looking at the results
from a select few games I'm going to
heavily analyze the data from 20 plus
games across multiple resolutions to get
a clearer idea of how the our X 480
stacks up before I do jump into the
benchmarks here are a few quick notes
all tests were conducted using my GPU
test rig which is built inside the
corsair carbide 600 C with an Intel Core
i7 6700 K clocked and locked at
four-and-a-half gigahertz for a full
list of the system specs please check
the video description you'll also find a
detailed video index there as well
finally all benchmarks are conducted
after a 10-minute warmup period is this
the sufficient time to get these cards
up to their maximum working
temperature as always I'm using
reference engine and video graphics
cards unless specified I'll be focusing
on the 1440p resolution for the
discussion but I'll quickly take a look
at the 1080p performance as well
first up we have doom with the nightmare
quality settings the arcs 480 was
slightly faster than the i-93 90 here
and therefore much faster than the gtx
960 and r9 380 increasing the resolution
to 1440 PS is the RX for 80 average 65
fps making a 6 percent slower than the
GTX 970 but 5 percent faster than the I
9 390 it was also 48 percent faster than
the gtx 960 and 63 percent faster than
the unha-3 80 for those wondering it was
32 percent slower than the gtx 1070
which is a very good result for AMD
given the price even with the epic
quality settings enabled and overwatch
and 100% scale rendering the RX 480 is
able to push just over 100 FPS
interaction packed by benchmark at 1440p
a very smooth 67 FPS was delivered by
the RX 4 80 making it just 4% slower
than the r9 390 and 8 percent slower
than the gtx 970
unfortunately the RX 4 ad wasn't quite
as impressive at 1440p as it was at
1080p and overwatch for those wondering
an average 35 fps of 4k and 45 fps when
used in the ultra preset the RX 4 80
impressed in the division delivering r9
390x like performance though to be fair
for whatever reason very little
separates the mid-range cards in this
test now at 1440p the margins widened
then the RX for 80 falls behind not just
the i9 390x but also the vanilla 390
still it was 2% faster than the gtx 970
and 68% faster than the gtx 960 for
hitman i'll focus on the DirectX 12
results since they're the most relevant
here the RX 4 80 average and impressive
72 fps making it just 3 FPS slower than
the i9 390x
at 1440p the RX 4 ad remained quite
strong matched in the r9 390 in beating
the GTX 970 by convincing 36% margin
sadly Just Cause 3 doesn't play that
nicely with the Radeon graphics cards
the average result isn't bad but
stuttering is noticeable and results in
a much lower minimum frame rate than the
Nvidia graphics cards whereas the GTX
970 never dropped below 59 FPA
the RX 480 goes as low as 46 fps the RX
4 ad was 4% faster than the GTX 970 on
average despite a much lower minimum
frame rate still when compared to the i9
390x
the RX 4 ad performed very well
delivering similar results here we see
the RX 4 ad has no trouble delivering
highly playable smooth performance in
fallout 4 using the maximum in-game
quality settings as the frame rate never
dropped below 71 fps the RX 4 80 matched
the GTX 970 at 1440p with an average of
56 fps making a 2 percent slower than
the r9 390 65 percent faster than the
gtx 960 and 44 percent faster than the
r9 380 car thieves are gonna love the
value the our X 480 delivers here we see
a very punchy 94 FPS at 1080p making the
our X 480 slightly faster than the r9
390x once again we find the Arc's 480 to
be a little less impressive at 1440p
here it felt well behind not just the
390 X but also the 390 as well as the
GTX 970 still was 54% faster than the
gtx 960 and 37% faster than the r9 380
here we see the RX 480 is struggling to
keep up with the r9 390 and ARMA 3 which
is something we haven't often seen the
only other game with the RX 4 ID has
been notably slower was the division
though the margin was less in that case
the RX 4 ad for whatever reason didn't
perform as expected in arma 3 as it was
23% slower than the UH 930 90 and 14%
slower than the GTX 970 this could
simply be a driver issue or perhaps the
lack of bandwidth when compared to say
the I know 390 is an issue here the RX
480 looks to be finishing on a high note
with an average of 55 FPS at 1080p
making it just 2 FPS slower than the I
know 390 X and 5 fps faster than the GTX
970 at 1440p the RX 480 still remains
strong and although it was just 1 FPS
faster than the i-93 90 it beat the GTX
970 by a much more convincing 24% margin
it also crushed the GTX 960 by 91%
margin for good measure here we see the
our X 480 allowed for a total system
power consumption figure of 235 watts
this is an average taken from multiple
games this places the arcs 480 on par
with the GTX 970 and gtx 1070 in terms
of consumption
this means it's similar to the gtx
in terms of efficiency but miles behind
the GTS 1070 the rx4 ad was on average
just three to four percent faster than
the 970 a twenty eight nanometer part
mind you and yet it consumed a similar
level of power frankly for this new 14
nanometer GPU I find the result of bit
disappointing particularly given AMD's
bold efficiency claims as we just saw
the R X 480 isn't this power efficient
as we might have thought and as a result
it does run rather warm reaching 81
degrees after a few minutes for cut that
consumes similar levels of power to the
gtx 1070 and 970 AMD sure of stuck a
little heatsink on it that probably
explains why the fan spins up quite a
bit under heavy load I wouldn't say it's
loud but it makes itself known whereas
the gtx 1070 remains near silent still
it's worth keeping in mind that AMD and
NVIDIA reference cards almost always run
at around 80 degrees is the tempted so
this isn't out of the ordinary so that
was a small 9 game sample of the 23
games tested so in a moment we'll check
out how the RX 4 ad compares to its
competition on a much grander scale but
first I'd like to touch on a couple of
other things the DirectX 12 testing is
limited I know but it isn't entirely my
fault there just aren't that many good
DirectX 12 games yet that said I do plan
to create a DirectX 12 performance video
in the near future so keep an eye out
for that also I realize overclocking
hasn't been covered yet
typically I cover the overclocking angle
of these new GPUs in a separate video
however I'm having a serious amount of
trouble pushing the RX 4 80 past 1.3
gigahertz which is pretty shocking given
what I was expecting
I've spoken with a few other reviewers
and they're also facing extreme
limitations when it comes to
overclocking this card at the time of
creating this video I'm yet to start
work on the overclocking video instead
I'm holding out for some kind of magical
overclocking setting from AMD that they
haven't suggested there is one so it's
looking more and more like the our X 480
over clocks about as well as the fury X
while I try and come to terms with that
realization let's move on and crunch
some numbers through the our X 480 the
goal is to surpass the r9 390 and in a
way it has if only just at 1080p we
found it was an average 2% faster the
only games where performance was
noticeably down with Crysis 3 and ARMA 3
the rx 480 was considerably faster in
Batman Arkham Knight though I'm yet to
determine if this was a result
new better driver moving to 1440p was a
little troubling for the RX 480 and it's
now 2 percent slower than the i9 390
ARMA 3 cause big issues of this
resolution while Crysis 3 and Star Wars
Battlefront also proved difficult
comparing the RX 480 to the GTX 970 saw
big wins and the DirectX 12 titles
though to be fair AMD has a significant
advantage and hitman regardless of the
API being used for the most part the RX
4 80 had the upper hand in this battle
at 1080p the RX forehead is struggled
against the o9 390 or 1440p but fares
well again compared to the GTX 970
whereas 4% faster on average for those
of you running AMD's last generation
$200 GPU the r9 380 you can expect
around a 40% performance boost at 1080p
when I go into the RX 480
on average we saw a healthy 44% increase
in framerate gtx 960 owners stand to
gain even more performance from an Rx
for ad upgrade as we found on average
59% more performance over invidious
previous generation $200 GPU now for the
comparison many of you been waiting for
the RX 4 80 versus the gtx 1070 this is
both an intriguing and yet ultimately
pointless comparison but for interests
sake let's make it a 1080p the RX 4 80
was just 32% slower than the gtx 1070
which is quite good
given all cost at least 37 percent less
once the gtx 1070 drops down to the MSRP
at today's prices the RX 4 80 should
come in a bid over 40% cheaper things
don't change much at 1440p here the RX 4
80 was 33% slower so again not a bad
result for AMD the only issue with this
comparison is the power consumption
despite dropping a little over 30%
performance the RX 4 80s still consumes
the same amount of power on that note
let's take a quick look at the
performance versus power consumption
data the further a data plot is to the
right on the x-axis the faster the
framerate well the higher the figure is
on the y-axis the greater the power
consumption so in short if you're a GPU
you want ideally to be as low and as far
right on this graph as possible doing
just that as the gtx 1070 which consumed
just 1.96 watts per frame the RX 480 was
considerably worse 2.9 watts per frame
placing it pretty well on par with the
last generations gtx 970 and by
I'm the GTX 980 now on a final
scatterplot we're looking at the cost
per frame data again being further to
the right indicates greater performance
while the lower on the y-axis the better
as this means the cheaper the cost per
frame as you can see the our X 480 just
beats out the gtx 970 and crashes the
previous generation $200 GPUs in terms
of value this for me is the RX for you
saving grace the price though granted
it's hardly revolutionary looking at the
GTX 970 this is particularly true once
you consider how well the GTX 970
overclocks which will be sure to look at
in my overclocking video shortly
honestly right now not entirely sure how
I feel about the Radeon are exporting
I'm definitely disappointed with a few
things namely the complete lack of
overclocking Headroom and the power
consumption for a price versus
performance angle the RX 480 is quite
good though there's cheap GTX 970 is
getting around aren't helping I think
sending reviewers the $240 a gigabyte
model might have been a mistake I named
his path based on what I've seen when
comparing the r9 290x for gigabyte and
r9 390x 8 gigabyte graphics cards I
can't possibly imagine a 1080p or 1440p
scenario with a $40.00 premium for the
AQI version makes sense this might
change in the future but paying 20% more
for a budget card in the hopes that it
might be worth it down the track
probably won't pay off
you're better off putting that $40 in
the bank as a down payment to watch the
next upgrade that AMD not gone this way
the rx 40 would look considerably more
impressive in a cost per frame analysis
and would have probably made the $260
GTX 970 irrelevant for now we'll just
have to wait and see
as you're watching this I'm probably
down at the local computer shop trying
to get my hands on a four gigabyte model
