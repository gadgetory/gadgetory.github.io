yesterday Steve I guess he sacrificed as
much to give you all an ITX 2070 review
on the embargo deadline mammoth effort
to get that one out on time considering
we only got our samples a few days ago
if you haven't checked it out yet go
back give his video of you and even a
thumbs up because if we don't get enough
engagement on that video Steve is
probably facing a divorce
anyway towards the end of yesterday's
video Steve discussed a bit about
graphics card pricing and how everything
is shaping up today with the inclusion
of the RT X 2070 in this video I'll be
diving a bit deep into GPU pricing
towards again find the best value cards
on the market as well as to explore how
GPU prices have changed since we last
looked at them in July so a quick bit of
backstory before we get into the numbers
graphics card prices have come down
significantly since the start of the
year when the mining craze was in full
swing it was around May that everything
started to settle and then by July most
GPUs were at their MSRP something that
hadn't been the case for almost nine
months we're now in October and graphics
card manufacturers are facing a
different challenge that could affect
pricing at least in the United States
the import tariffs implemented by Donald
Trump the first set of 10% tariffs were
implemented on October 1st and that's
set to rise to 25% on January 1st 2019
we're now at October 17th so we've had
just over two weeks of the tariffs being
in place and the good news is the GPU
market hasn't been affected yet I've
been keeping a close eye on GPU prices
around the tariff introduction date and
so far the price of graphics cards has
stayed pretty much the same or even gone
down in some case so there hasn't been a
10% price includes anything like that
just yet
I say yet because we're only two weeks
into the tafs and most manufacturers
would have imported and stored plenty of
stock before the tariffs came into
effect certainly enough to last two
weeks I'm still expecting prices to rise
before the end of 2018
that's something we'll keep looking into
over the coming weeks but at least right
now the tariffs have had no in
okay so let's take a look at how GPUs
are priced right now starting with
mid-range offerings unlike in previous
videos where we've used typical sales
pricing all the data you see here is for
the lowest available GPU price on nuoc
so the cheapest available card in May
the cheapest in July and the cheapest in
October typical pricing ranges from this
minimum value to around twenty or thirty
dollars more in most cases so keep that
in mind
lower mid-range cards like the 1050 Ti
and rx 560 are still sitting well above
the MSRP and that's largely down to
higher memory prices compared to when
these cards were released the 1050 Ti is
21% more expensive and the rx 560 40%
more expensive although the rx 560 has
come down in price slightly compared to
July
neither of these cards will be seen at
their MSRP again so what we're seeing
today is likely the cheapest they'll get
as for AMD and NVIDIA is most popular
GPUs the GTX 1066 gigabyte is finally
back down to the MSRP having dropped in
price by 14% compared to July while the
1063 gigabyte is a bit inflated still in
July we've recommended the 1063 gigabyte
as the best value mid-range card on the
market so perhaps consumers have noticed
this value and are continuing to buy
that card meanwhile on the AMD front the
rx 570 is an absolute steal at the
moment retailing for just a hundred and
sixty US dollars lower than its launch
price having dropped 33% in price since
July the RX 580 has also come down by 11
percent now retailing for only slightly
above its launch price moving into the
higher end cards and what we have today
are three more cards at their MSRP the
gtx 1070 down 5% from its July price the
GTX 10 atti down 3% and Vega 56 down a
huge 17 percent but the even better news
is the rest of the non r-tx cards which
are all selling below their MSRP at the
moment the biggest discount is the gtx
1070 TI
which is currently available 13% below
its MSRP and just $10 more than the gtx
1070 the gtx 1080 is also sitting 10%
below its MSRP both cards were sitting
at
MSRP and July but with an oversupply and
r-tx cards now on the market prices are
looking pretty good for these cheap use
and then on the AMD site Vegas 64 has
seen a huge 17 percent drop in price
since joy now sitting four percent below
the MSRP for the cheapest model and when
you look at the prices for some of these
cards in May there have been massive
price cuts Vegas 64 and the GTX 10 atti
were both selling for $200 over the MSRP
just five months ago while AMD's
mid-range cards like the rx 580 were
still suffering from the tail end of the
mining Crace today it's a much more
attractive market for PC builders of
course then recently released our TX
cards are still selling for well over
the MSRP and the r-tx 20 atti in
particular is out of stock I wonder how
long it will take for these GPUs to hit
their aib MSRP s which are a hundred to
two hundred dollars less than their
current prices with most manufacturers
choosing to use Founders edition pricing
right now instead
and while pricing does look okay at the
moment compared to previous months for a
lot of these graphics cards it's still
worth mentioning that most of these
products have been on the market for at
least a year or in some cases more than
two years for a GPU like the GTX 1080
the fact that some of these cards are
only now selling for below their launch
price is pretty crazy they should be
well under the MSRP at this point but
the market has been so horrendous and
competitions so lackluster that we've
been stuck with high prices for a fairly
long time now so with all that pricing
in mind let's explore which cards are
the best value today we're going to
start by looking at assassin's creed
Odyssey which is the game we have most
recently benchmarked all these GPUs in
so we can get some really nice data here
we're using 1440p very high preset data
here if you're interested in the full
performance breakdown check out that
performance review that we've previously
put up on the channel because in this
video we'll only be discussing value
graphs so when you look at the cost per
frame breakdown it's no surprise seeing
more mid-range cards at the top of the
charts the RX 570 is the standard value
champion here followed by the gtx 1066
gigabyte just a little bit behind
as far as 1440p class cards are
concerned the gtx 1070 TI is the champ
here just edging out the gtx 1070 and
both are better value than vega 56 in
this title if you want to play at 4k
your options are limited to the 1080i or
poor value RTX cards the other title
we've recently benchmarked is Forte's a
horizon 4 which is much better optimized
across a range of GPUs and runs better
on AMD cards here the standout value
champion is again the rx 570 though the
RX 580 is also excellent for playing at
1440p with ultra settings we're also
seeing vega 56 beat the gtx 1070 to 1080
in terms of value while again the 1080
Ti is the best option for 4k high
refresh gaming it's an interesting turn
of events because back in July we were
talking about the RX 5 ad being roughly
level with the GTX 1063 gigabyte in
terms of value with the gtx 1066
gigabyte not far behind and the RX 570
definitely not as competitive but today
as far as these mid-range cards are
concerned the Arc's 570 is the clear
value champion at just 160 dollars while
the gtx 1066 gigabyte is better value
than the 3 gig model and it trades blows
with the RX 580 let's focus in more on
the higher end of the market with cards
suited to 1440p gaming and up here we
can switch to using a 20 game average
because we happen to have that data on
hand over the up end cards you can thank
the r-tx launch for that one if you're
interested in the exact 20 games we used
and the performance breakdown of each
card check out our RT x 2070 review
we're using the same games from that
review in steve's review of the RT x
2070 here used typical retail prices
when discussing value but we're going to
dial down here and discuss minimum
pricing as we've been doing so far
because we're assuming you guys are
bargain hunters or something like that
using minimums does change the
conversation slightly so let's take a
look at the data using current pricing
and our twenty game average at 1440p we
see a number of cards provide very
competitive value the gtx 1070 TI with
its current price 13% below MSRP just
manages to beat the 1070 1080 and vega
56 which are all evenly matched with
current prices really all our goodbyes
for 1440p builds but the 1070
TI in particular with its price so close
to the 1070 is the best value having
these four cards deliver near equivalent
value is also great for those with
slightly different budgets on the lower
end you can grab a 1070 TI for three
hundred and ninety dollars or you could
spend $60 more for the ten eighty
knowing you're getting a performance
increase in line with the price increase
and those who would rather go team red
for free sync or other reasons can now
safely buy Vega 56 knowing it's not
horrible value like it was several
months ago despite Vega 64 selling at
four percent below its MSRP it's not a
great buy right now compared to these
similarly priced GT X 1080 and it's no
surprise to see invidious new RTX cards
fail miserably in terms of value the RT
X 2070 is definitely not worth buying
compared to the 1080 right now and the
2080 can't match the 1080 Ti the 2080 ti
is the worst value but it offers
unequaled performance so it's really
only suitable for those with cash to
throw around flicking back to July it's
easy to see how things have changed back
then the gtx 1070 was the best value buy
with AMD pretty uncompetitive with vega
back then vega 56 was roughly on par
with the 1080 TI 4 value now vega 56 is
one of the best value buyers on the
market for higher-end cards what about
if cards were priced at their MSRP well
it's here that invidious r-tx cards in
particular the RT x 27 t become better
value the gtx 1070 and vega 56 would
still be the outright value champions
while the RT x 2080 would be a better
buy than the gtx 1080 TI and here's an
interesting thought experiment what
would the market look like if all
overpriced cards fell to their MSRP and
all cards currently selling for below
the MSRP remained at their current price
well would be in a situation where the
gtx 1070 TI would still be the best
value card on the market and the GT x
1080 would be a slightly better buy than
the RT x 2017 unless the 1080 falls in
price the 28 he would also be a slightly
better buy though not astonishing value
by any means so that's where at as far
as graphics card value is concerned and
videos new RT x cards well there might
not be anything special when it comes to
price to performance especially at the
moment when none can be found at the
MSRP
but there are still good value products
out there the rx 570 is the best value
at spending ages
the 1066 gigabyte and rx 580 are highly
competitive and the gtx 1070 TI sewing
for well below its MSRP provides decent
value for gamers that want to play at
1440p I think that just about does it
