be picking my favorite r-tx 2060
graphics cards now about two years ago I
did start our top 5 best series after
countless viewers kept asking me what's
the best gtx 1070 to buy was a little
more complicated than that as someone to
know which model was outright the best
some wanted to know which offered the
best value and others wanted to know
which was the best option for mini ITX
builds so i created 5 categories and
picked the best model fetch one and now
two years later I'm getting loads of
requests to do the same for the r-tx
2060 wasn't much interest in the rest of
the r-tx series but the 2060 seems to
have gotten quite a few of you a bit
excited any problem here being that it's
not worth making 5 categories for the
HUD CX 2060 series so I've been forced
to ditch one and just make a well I
first have a top four best video so
hopefully that works anyway for this one
the categories will be the best price
the best blower style best mini ITX and
then the best premium model
at the moment there are many models
selling for $350 u.s. MSRP in fact as I
put this video together there was just
two gigabyte models the very plainly
named r-tx 2060 you see and the RCX 2016
Mini ITX OCU a few days prior there was
also the zotac gaming r-tx 2060 twin fan
which I had been recommending as it was
a really good value product at $350 but
now it has jumped back up to 370 dollars
and it appears to be out of stock in a
lot of places so I'm not sure if pricing
will drop back down to 350 u.s. once the
stock issues are corrected or not
anyway if you can get the zotac twin fan
model for $50 u.s. it's certainly a
worthwhile option but with the plainly
named gigabyte r-tx 2060 you see
currently available at 350 dollars u.s.
it is the better choice I've been
watching this model for some time now
and pricing has been very consistent it
came in as one of the cheapest models at
$270 US and for the last month it's been
available at all major online retailers
for 350 dollars so this means gigabytes
RTX 2060 OC is the best price 2060 and
while it is a very basic model that
packs some decent features such as
alternate spinning fans direct touch
copper heat pipes and a full length
backplate but as a base model it's a
well it's basic as I said it's by no
means the coolest or quietest r-tx 2060
out there and if you're willing to spend
twenty or thirty dollars more you will
get a much better product in that
respect
for whatever reason quite a few of you
have asked me which is the best blower
style
RTX 2060 personally I don't like the
blower style cards and I'm very thankful
that both Nvidia and AMD have moved away
from them for their reference design
cards but I suppose in certain
situations they do make sense and now
with the reference cards not offering a
blower design it does make finding one a
bit harder so that being the case your
options are extremely limited there are
just a few models and really only one of
them is widely available at this point
that is the asustor bow the turbo r-tx
2060 priced at 390 dollars u.s. it's
certainly not cheap in fact it's up
there with the most expensive models and
while I would typically recommend
avoiding it if you must get a blower
style car then this is probably your
best choice there's not much to say
about this one really it features an 80
millimeter IP 5x dual will bearing fan
some subtle lighting it measures 268
millimeters long and it is of course a
dual slot card
now for the best me ITX r-tx 2060
graphics card there are two main choices
here the msi r-tx 2060 Aero ITX OC or
the giba r-tx 2016 mini ITX OC and i'm
going to go with the gigabyte model for
this one few reasons for that not least
of which is the fact that it's the only
one you can actually buy right now while
msi has announced the r-tx 2060 Aero ITX
OC good luck finding one it doesn't
really appear to be on sale yet not sure
where you can get one I certainly
haven't been able to find it that said
I'd recommend the gigabyte version
anyways it is slightly shorter and
perhaps more crucially not as tall the
126 millimeter height of the MSI model
and will make compatibility with some of
these smaller mini ITX cases such as the
geek a 30 very difficult the 121
millimeter height of the gigabyte
version is much more suitable to these
smaller cases the gigabyte model also
has a zero rpm fan mode and when
underloaded is relatively quiet for a
single fan RTX 2060 then perhaps best of
all it's readily available at the MSRP
mainly you can buy one today for just
350 dollars u.s.
if you're not having a structured budget
to get 90 X 2060 so that is to say you
have a little extra spending money and
you want a premium experience then I
highly recommend the recently
interviewed a soos ROG Strix r-tx 2060
OC gaming priced at $500 us it is $50
more expensive than base models but you
get a lot more graphics card for the
money granted it's not much faster but
it is significantly cooler and quieter
out of the box at run at just 62 degrees
and that was an 11 degree improvement
over the similarly priced MSI r-tx 2060
gaming z vr m and GDD are six memory
temperatures were also very low relative
to other high-end RT x 2016 models and
our card overclocked like a champ
holding an operating frequency of 2055
megahertz with ease just be aware that
this thing is the size of a high-end
graphics card it measures 300
millimeters long stands 132 millimeters
tall and is a whopping 50 millimeters
wide making it a triple slight card
there's three 85 millimeter fans a full
size backplate and enough customizable
RGB lighting to put your Christmas tree
to shame though for those of you after a
stealth look you can kill the lighting
with a press of a button
overall the Isuzu ROG Strix artex 2060
OC gaming won't disappoint those after a
premium are TX 2060 graphics card
picking the right RTX 2060 is a little
tricky so hopefully this video was
useful to those of you looking at
purchasing one but for the most part it
really is all about the price problem is
there are very few $350 us options to
choose from and once you get up over the
MSRP they all seem to jump up pretty
close to $400 u.s. if you're going to
spend say $380 u.s. for example you
might as well just go the full hog at
that point and get the beastly or soos
ROG Strix RT X 2060 OC gaming it's at
least $100 cheaper than a base model
RTX 2070 and for the most part does
offer very similar performance also the
cheapest Vega graphics cards still cost
a little over $400 and you'll be
hard-pressed to get one that matches the
quality of the ROG Strix RT X 2060 OC
gaming anyway that is going to do it for
this one if you did enjoy the video be
