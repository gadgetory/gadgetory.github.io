on sale and fans of the series will no
doubt be chomping the beard to delve
into the story and discover what the
latest installment has to offer
if 2013's reboot is anything to go by
the second reboot to its series is going
to be amazing
unfortunately for PC gamers rise of the
Tomb Raider was released a few months
prior and Xbox they'll be it with vastly
inferior graphics and frame rates
therefore I feel like we're really
seeing this game for the first time and
I'm PC we really are
rise of the Tomb Raider utilizes AMD's
pure hair technology which is an updated
version of tress effects featured in the
previous title in addition to the pure
hair technology which has also been
utilized in upcoming Square Enix games
such as Deus Ex mankind divided PC games
are also able to adjust textures shadows
immune occlusion depth of field level of
detail and dynamic foliage you might
think that because the game uses AMD's
open-source hair technology and the fact
that the previous title was AMD
sponsored that this is also the case
with rise of the Tomb Raider sadly this
isn't the case and it said in videos
once again got their hands and yet
another triple-a title so what does this
mean for NVIDIA users essentially
nothing I mean yes there is a game ready
driver ready prior to the official
launch and a video has been able to
ensure their GPUs are performing
optimally these are all things that
could have been done if AMD had
sponsored the title meanwhile the free
spirit that is AMD looks to be getting
shafted once again and ultimately so - a
game is rocking the Radian GPU MD claims
that because this is an Nvidia game west
title they don't get the same level of
access than they would otherwise
this makes optimizing for the game and
fixing any issue is extremely difficult
therefore it's unlikely we'll see the
true AMD Radeon performance and rise of
the Tomb Raider even within the next few
weeks and it could be longer that being
said please let me make it clear that
we're testing using a game ready driver
from video designed specifically for
rise of the Tomb Raider well we're
having to rely on AMD's latest Crimson
addition 16.1 driver which isn't
optimized at all for testing we use this
70 second cutscene which accurately
represented the most demanding
performances saw throughout the game the
cutscene was preferred over game players
extremely easy to accurately reproduce
over and over again all tests were
conducted with pure hair enabled and the
very high quality setting preset was
used along with some 1080p results using
the medium quality preset it's very high
quality setting of the tested at 1080p
1440p and 4k both the average and
minimum frame rates were recorders and
we've included almost all the latest
current generation G's many of my people
prisoner you should leave this place
before it's too late I can't do that I
came here for something important so did
they if I see you again I'll put an
arrow in your throat you and I are on
the same side I hope I can prove that to
you
what's going on down there
rise of the Tomb Raider is an incredibly
beautiful looking game and damn is the
demanding here at 1080p we find that the
GTX 960 is good for just 28 FPS with
frame rates dip to an unplayable 18 fps
and the r9 380 is a much better even the
380 X struggles in 234 fps on average
and a 20 FPS minimum that's around 40%
less performance than what we were
seeing in Just Cause 3 at the same
resolution interestingly these frame
rates are very similar to what we've
seen when testing the witcher 3 while at
times with the quality settings maxed
out as the GC x 960 average is just 29
FPS with an 18 FPS minimum at 1080p for
playable performance at 1080p gamers are
going to require geforce gtx 970 or even
better a radeon r9 390 it's nice to see
the 390 not just outperforming the 970
here but also delivering a solid gaming
experience the higher end card such as
the nano provided a nice performance
boost as did the GTX 980 though as usual
it's the gtx 980ti that really stands
out dropping the quality preset from
very high down to medium while skipping
high in the process it's possible to
receive smooth playable performance the
gtx 960 and r9 381 the I know 380 in
particular delivered excellent
performance with the 30fps minimum
interestingly however the GTX 970 is
able to overtake the 390 under these
conditions to match the 390x perhaps
reducing the amount of VRAM acquired
under these lower quality settings helps
give the 970 an advantage here something
we'll look at a bit later is how much of
an impact reducing the quality preset
from very high to medium has on the
image quality for now let's move on to
the 1440p results I suspect they're
going to be brutal given what I'm seeing
at 1080p at 1440p I know 390 and GTX 970
you were really stretched to their
limits it's very surprising to find that
at this high resolution the 970
overtakes the 390 by 3 FPS to come
within just one frame of the 390x
meanwhile the nano and 980 produced
similar performance with an average of
just 40 FPS while the game was perfectly
playable at times you would notice those
sub
minimums for silky-smooth gameplay the
gtx 980ti will be desired at this
resolution now at 4k we find that isn't
a single GPU capable of delivering
smooth playable performance and rise of
the Tomb Raider using the very high
preset it is worth pointing out that
it's possible to customize the quality
settings further so the very high preset
isn't actually cranking every setting to
the max pure hair for example can be
turned up even higher in short games
want a pair of fury acts or gtx 980ti
graphics card a smooth 4k rise of the
Tomb Raider gameplay that said even then
you're looking at well under 60fps on
average ouch
personally I like to crank up all the
quality settings and enjoy a game in all
of its glory however doing so doesn't
always make it noticeable difference to
the image quality take god rays and
fallout 4 as a perfect example in the
case of rise of the Tomb Raider we could
really find any one quality setting that
had a huge impact on performance
probably the most significant settings
we impact performance was pure hair
while it wasn't outrageous for the most
part many of these minimum frame rates
can be attributed to the use of this
setting still this technology looks
amazing and frankly without it Lara
looks like she could have jumped out of
a 10 year old game effects such as
motion blur don't do a lot for me and
while I often prefer them disabled
especially if they're over the top they
don't have any meaningful impact on the
framerate here we have a quick
comparison of the game running at 1080p
using the medium high and very high
preset in this first set we have a good
view of a snow-covered ground please
note this image hasn't been blown up or
zoomed in the very high texture quality
is clearly better when looking at the
snow and if I move ahead a bit and pause
see the shadow quality is much more
detailed the comparison isn't exactly
night and day but it's the subtle
details like this that really do add to
the overall experience the difference
here as Lara draws her bow is almost
impossible to spot between the high and
very high settings the medium quality
setting also looks much the same the
exception of the bridge in the
background which isn't as well lit
looking at Lara's face up close there's
almost no difference to be seen again
the high and very high setting is much
the same and that works
playing what I saw miss no difference in
framerate when comparing the two the
medium quality settings is noticeably
less shadow in a large space and the
texturing of our scarf is much lower in
this scene which focuses on Sofia
we can see that the very high setting
offers more realistic lighting and
shadows most noticeable around her waist
area the rock behind her also features
noticeably better texturing and you can
see the improved quality of the depth of
field setting when looking at the bridge
in the background this scene which looks
at Lara and the surrounding environment
from a distance shows almost no image
quality difference between medium high
and very high that's said in the top
corner behind the on screen statistics
you'll see the very high setting
features more dynamic fog finally all
three settings set pure hair to on and
as you can see the quality setting is
the same on medium high and very high it
was interesting to discover that for the
most part PC gamers can still enjoy a
high level of image quality with the
medium quality preset that's good news
those it affords those with lower end
cards such as the GTX 960 and r9 380 to
receive a little over 40% more
performance despite the lack of
optimization provides the Tomb Raider
I'm surprised by how well the game runs
on Radian based GPUs such as the r9 390x
if we take a look at a time-lapse graph
you can see the 390x as the times able
to match the gtx 980
the issue for the Radian based graphics
cards at this point seems to be the
margin between the minimum and maximum
frame rate is quite large if Andy can
reduce this fluctuation in performance
then will very likely see some strong
numbers from the Radian graphics cards
in the future as expected and video has
already afforded themselves the chance
to optimize the drivers to rise of the
Tomb Raider so we don't expect
performance to improve much from this
point forward as for rise of the Tomb
Raider itself I would say despite the
linear gameplay it's a heap of fun and
those gorgeous graphics keep it
activated from start to finish the
highly detailed sets and cinematic
in-game cutscenes help keep the game
fresh and exciting even after hours of
gameplay thanks for joining me for
another game performance video let me
know what you think of the rise of the
Tomb Raider game in the comments and I
know for my harbour and box comm don't

I'll see you guys next time yeah
