today we'll be checking out a game that
ranked very highly on everyone's top 10
list for 2017 that game is of course
Mass Effect Andromeda and for good
reason the Mass Effect series has been
very solid since day one and as such has
developed a huge fan base and that fan
base has been very keen for an update as
it's been something like 5 years since
we saw the last installment in the Mass
Effect series as the fourth installment
the Mass Effect series Andromeda
promises to be beer and more beautiful
and based on initial impressions it
certainly looks as though the game
delivers on those promises that says
there are a few issues namely the game's
poor animations which do spoil the
single-player experience somewhat
previously the Mass Effect games were
built upon the Unreal Engine but with
Andromeda a shift to frostbite story was
made this movement the buyer had to
build all systems tools and assets from
scratch ironically a big part of this
which was to help enhance character
animation so I hope they had more
success in other areas although the
frostbite 3 game engine does support
DirectX 12 the developer has opted to
stick with DX 11 at least for now anyway
that's not totally surprising though as
despite delivering many visually
impressive Mass Effect games over the
years this series has never really
pushed game engines to their limits the
previous three installments all use
DirectX 9 for example even 2012 Mass
Effect 3 stuck with DirectX 9 despite
wide use of DirectX 10 at the time and
even the availability of DirectX 11 for
PC players the developer recommends game
is run with ear the intel core i7 4790
or the AMD FX 8350 which is a very odd
contrast surely a lower-end Core i5
processor will suffice if they're
recommending an FX 8350 clearly these
recommendations were made before rise
and landed on the graphics card site it
suggested that gamers arm themselves as
at least a GTX 10 63 gigabyte or a GTX
970 graphics card apparently if you are
using a raid on graphics card you're out
of luck obviously something like the rx
470 will suffice if they're recommending
a GTX
10 63 gigabyte by failing to mention a
single AMD graphics cards
quite clear this is an nvidia sponsored
title so you can expect the green team
to have the upper hand at least out of
the gate that said AMD who seem to be
very much on top of their driver game
right now have already released an
update to better support the game AMD is
claiming performance gains after 12% on
the radio and our X 480 with an i7 6700k
and 8 gigabytes of ddr4 2666 memory that
boost sees frame rates go from 50 3.7
FPS to a much healthier 60 point 1sps at
1080p likely contributing to these
performance games or at least a good
chunk of them is the added optimized
tessellation profile for the game so for
testing we use the AMD radeon crimson
edition graphics driver seventeen point
three point two for testing the Radeon
GPUs and then video based GPS were
tested using GeForce Camry driver three
seven eight point seven eight we
benchmark using the core i7 77 ok test
machine which sees the processor running
at four point nine gigahertz with 32
gigabytes of ddr4 3000 memory the
performance numbers that you're about to
see are based on a 60 second frat pass
from the beginning of the single-player
campaign after the player controlled
character crash-lands falls onto habitat
seven since EA's origin game client
locks you out of the game for 24 hours
after five hardware changes are made
whether like the graphics card or the
CPU
this made testing painfully slow in the
end I had to purchase three copies of
the game on three separate accounts just
so I could test 15 configurations per
day finally for testing we have focused
our attention on the ultra quality
preset and I have to say that these
quality settings the game looks
phenomenal we also tested at the three
standard resolutions being 1080p 1440p
and 4k Before we jump to the benchmark
results here's just a quick look at the
fraps path I'll show 10 or 15 seconds of
it and then I'll slide it up into the
top corner there and we'll start looking
at the results and discuss those don't
read here now that I've got away the
energy club reported
stamp set it's dark energy but doesn't
stain even with Amy's recent driver
update the gtx 980ti still enjoys a
serious performance advantage over the
fury ex delivering 24% more frames on
average the 980ti looks very comfortable
with a 71 FPS minimum while a fury X
dropped down to 54 fps and the standard
980 s slightly slower again at 53 fps I
have to say it's not often you see the
GTX 970 beating the r9 390x with ease
and that's the current situation here
the same is true in comparing the r9 380
to the GTX 960 the GeForce graphics card
is a whisker faster here and just able
to deliver playable performance at 1080p
using the ultra quality settings the
same can't be said sadly for the r7 370
and gtx 950 though bumping the
resolution up to 1440p really hammers
performance and now we're looking at
just 53 FPS on average from the gtx
980ti with a 46 FPS minimum
despite that though Z 982 I was still
23% Fast and the Furious which averaged
just 43 FPS for a minimum of 30 FPS
gamers will require the r9 390x
or GTX 970 if they wish to play at 1440p
with all the our candy turned up right
so given what we've seen at the
previously tested resolutions it's no
surprise that even the gtx 980ti can't
deliver playable performance at the 4k
resolution here we see an average of
this 28 FPS with a minimum of 24 FPS the
latest crop of GPUs offer more models
capable of pushing over 60 FPS at 1080p
as you might have expected the Titan XP
and GTX 1080i were good for over 100 FPS
at all times and averaged around 120 fps
the GT X 1080 was also very respectable
often pushing frame rates above 100 fps
it was a rather large drop down to the
gtx 1070 but even so with almost 80 FPS
on average performance was still very
impressive the gtx 1066 gigabyte easily
beats the RX 480 despite AMD's recent
rover update
and here we see the 488 gigabyte
delivering similar performance to 3d
about 1060 still we found that GPUs such
as the rx 470 and gtx 750ti we're still
able to deliver playable performance at
1080p
1440p we see that you can achieve
playful performance with the RX 474
gigabyte RS for AT&amp;amp;T gigabyte gtx 1060
if only just having said that though
ideally gamers will want at least a gtx
1070 and we do see a rather good
argument for going with the GT x 1080
here as it provided 31% more performance
taking the average frame rate through 71
FPS again the gtx 1080 TI was just 15%
faster than the standard gtx 1080 and
frankly i was hoping to see more from in
videos new $700 GPU now again at the 4k
resolution we find that very few GPUs
are capable of delivering smooth
performance the GTX a just gets by with
a 38 FPS average and a 33 FPS minimum
then we have the GTX 1080 TI which
delivered just 13% more performance that
I have to say the gains were more
noticeable here here we have more bars
and Alcatraz as I attempt to squeeze all
26 GPUs tested into a single graph here
we see that the 980ti roughly matched
the gtx 1070 and both really put the
fury x in its place meanwhile the three
gigabyte 1060 is on par with the r9 nano
again this isn't something you often see
if ever
AMD claims it was the latest drive of
the RX 4 he went from 54 fps and their
testing to 60 fps well using that very
driver we saw at 53 FPS on average this
was a clean driver install so there was
nothing left behind that could upset
performance
so either AMD hasn't made any
improvements yet or the performance that
we would have seen without this driver
would have looked very bad indeed I
haven't had time to look into this year
and with origin constantly locking me
out of my multiple copies it's made
making further tests a little bit
challenging so I'll have to look into
that tomorrow
moving to 1440p we see similar margins
though this time the gtx 1066 gear but
does fall behind the fury x and the
standard fury that says the three
gigabyte gtx 1060 was still faster than
the RX 48 year byte and r9 390 GPUs
finally at 4k we once again fight there
are very few GPUs available right now
that will cut it in fact even the Titan
XP and GTX 1082 I dip below 40 fps at
times which obviously is an ideal
for rapping testing up let's see how the
gtx 1066 year bike versus RX 488
gigabyte compare side-by-side in the
first 30 seconds or so of our benchmark
as you can see although the gtx 1060
came out 8% faster at 1080p the overall
performance was quite similar the reason
for the larger than expected performance
variance is down to the fact that when
the rs4 idea seen bottoming out at
around 48 fps the gtx 1060 is still
pushing around 54 FPS or 13% more frames
I should also mention that the result
seen previously in graph form are based
on an average of three runs so the our X
480 minimum is our unusual you will
constantly see them before wrapping
things up I thought it'd be cool to see
how the 7700 K clocked at four point
nine yards compares to the horizon 7
1800 X with all cores clocked at 4
gigahertz using the Titan XP so the most
part performance was very similar
especially in areas where we were seeing
heavier CPU load for those of you
wondering the CPU utilization looked
much the same in the multiplayer portion
of the game well there you have it a
fairly in-depth look at what it takes to
play Mass Effect and all of its glory on
the PC ideally though I would have liked
to include it a few more tests and look
at things such as quality scaling to say
the GTX 1060 and rx 480
but ran out of time thanks to Origen
constantly locking me out for a 24 hour
period due to too many hardware changes
so depending on how I go for time over
the next few days I would like to
revisit the game for more GPU testing
and even some CPU testing that's it if I
don't get around to doing that right
away you can expect to see more testing
in the new future as I will be adding
this title to the battery of games that
are already test with overall Mass
Effect Andromeda is an amazing looking
game that seems like a lot of fun to
play I also had a quick goal to
survival-type online multiplayer mode
where you join a team of other players
and try to defend a wave after wave of
AI enemies and yeah that was a lot of
fun as well anyway that's all for this
one I have some more cool content coming
later in the week so watch your inbox
I'm your host Steve
hope to see you again soon
