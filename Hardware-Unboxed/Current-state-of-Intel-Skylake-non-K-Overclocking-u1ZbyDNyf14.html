that they discovered how to overclock
any and all intel sky like desktop
processors using one of theirs e170
motherboards using the base clock method
it was now possible to push relatively
inexpensive processes such as the core
i5 6400 from a standard operating
frequency of just 2.7 gigahertz to well
over 4 gigahertz this was incredible
news for budget builders though most of
his feared and well expected Intel to
try and block the overclock now two
months later until his force board
partners such as a drug to roll out a
bios update that removes the overclock
on non k processes so what does this
mean for enthusiasts that me the
overclocked turn on k processor or a
plan to there's a heap of misinformation
out there about how Intel's update is
rolled out and how it will impact
overclock is in this short video I hope
to provide some information that will
help clear things up how Intel disables
the base clock overclock is through a
micro code update and it seems almost
everyone realizes this but if you
understand how the microcode is
delivered and how it works firstly Intel
can't deliver this update by our
Microsoft Windows Update this is the
theory I hear the most the CPU micro
courage is part of the motherboards BIOS
in other words it lives within the BIOS
code and not the CPU or Windows based
software so if you're currently rocky a
non case sky like overclock the only
possible way if you lose it by updating
your BIOS to a newer version that
features Intel's latest microcode the
asrock said 170 extreme plus for example
supported the non-key overclock using
bios version 2.1 6 a version which has
now been removed from the asrock website
the latest version 2.60 features the
updated microcode referring to 0 x 76
which removes the sky OC function so
what happens if you buy a news at 170
motherboard which has already been
loaded with the updated bios and
therefore microcode assuming you can get
your hands on the OC bios it's possible
to flash back to the previous version to
regain the base quater overclocking
ability again the microcode isn't
written to
the cpu and is kept at the bias level so
rolling back isn't a problem to confirm
this i updated my z 170 extreme seven
plus the motherboard to version 2.6 oh
and sure enough the overclocked no
longer work after rolling back to
version 2.1 six the ability of
overclocked my nan ke process is
returned so the key issues stopping non
case khaya cohen is from overclocking is
the ability to download a supporting by
us as manufacturers such as asrock have
been pressured by intel into removing
them from their website thankfully they
are available from resources such as
overclocking guy which i'll link in the
description they've amassed a huge
amount of non KO verkaufen biases for
board makes such as a sous asrock msi
and gigabyte obviously this was far more
convenient previously when motherboard
makers such as asrock were officially
supporting these biases but at least it
can still be done the non case kike
overclocking box has been opened as much
as intel tries they won't be able to
fully close it so in short the microcode
can only be delivered by a biased update
and micro code updates aren't permanent
it is possible to roll back to an
earlier version going forward there are
a few reasons why you would need to
update your bias especially if
everything was working as it should with
the overclocking BIOS if you've got any
questions at all then please let me know
in the comments or on our forum hardware
unbox com see you guys next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
