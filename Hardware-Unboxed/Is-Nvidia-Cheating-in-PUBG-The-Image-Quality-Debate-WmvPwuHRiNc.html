today's video we're going to be
investigating if an nvidia is a big old
pub g cheater or if everything's
aboveboard
recently a video started to gain a bit
of attention for showing a noticeable
difference in image quality between the
Pascal and Vega GPUs now I'm not going
to point that exact video out because
image quality wasn't the focus of that
video and the Creta responsible for it
has said they will be doing a retest
rather the purpose the video in question
was to compare the FPS performance
between the Pascal and Vega GPUs but
viewers quickly spotted some visual
differences and it appeared that the
Radeon graphics card was rendering the
game in greater detail the reason I'm
looking into this other than the fact
that it is an interesting topic and if
Nvidia are being sneaky with their
quality settings that's certainly worth
uncovering of course the fact that so
many of you guys have asked me to look
into it but the real reason I'm jumping
on this right now is because next week
early next week I will have a video
comparing over 30 ami and NVIDIA GPUs in
player unknowns battlegrounds so I
thought I would address this ahead of
time with so much controversy
surrounding this image quality issue
right now I felt it was best to address
this before getting to the massive FPS
comparison for testing I'm using the
latest version of pub G with the latest
display drivers from AMD and NVIDIA so
this means the three 8871 drivers from
Nvidia and the 17 point 12.2 driver from
AMD all gameplay footage was recorded
using external capture device and this
unfortunately has limited me to the
1080p resolution but that'll still be
enough to reveal if there are any visual
quality differences the reference AMD
Radeon rx Vega 56 graphics card is being
used and that will be pitched against
the msi geforce gtx 1070 gaming X model
and yes that is a factory overclocked
model an FPS counter will be displayed
for each GPU but the focus for this
video really is on image quality
I'm also focusing on the miramar map as
this is where the big GPU benchmark
comparison will take place okay well I
think that's about everything let's get
to the footage
okay let's pause here for a second
looking at the ground textures there's
no noticeable difference between the two
GPUs both the close-up and distant
textures as well as the shadows look
exactly the same or at least they do to
me anyway then pausing again here we can
see that the vegetation detail is the
same across the full draw distance range
and the mountains in the background
feature the same level of detail
overlooking the town here we see all the
same features the texture quality is all
the same the shadow quality again looks
much the same as far as I can tell the
image quality is identical
here we can see the quality of the
buildings and again everything from the
textures shadow is an overall detail
level look identical as a side note at
this point of the test Vega is also
ahead rendering 92 FPS to 88 FPS for the
GTX 1070 looking up at this building
under construction I again see no
noticeable difference between the two
images please ignore the screen tearing
this was recorded on a 60 Hertz 4k
monitor and obviously resync is disabled
for the testing
here we come to the end of this
particular test and I decided to go out
with a bang or more of a thud I suppose
anyway jumping from the top floor gives
us a good view of the ground before we
make a fatal impact here we can see a
large amount of shadows and again all of
them look the same on both GPUs
then I have this last little bit of
footage and I won't bother pausing this
and discussing it because I think at
this point it's pretty clear Nvidia
aren't being a big old cheaters in pub G
unlike anyone and everyone who's ever
killed me in any online multiplayer game
so there you have it with the latest
version of the game using the latest
drives from both AMD and NVIDIA
everything looks to be aboveboard as
usual Vega 56 looks very respectable
compared as a competition sadly though
vega 64 is less impressive and you'll
see that in next week's video
anyway that's gonna do it for this one I
hope that helps clear up the image
quality controversy Armijo Steve and
I'll catch you again very soon for a
mega GPU benchmark session
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
