planned to skip over making this video
even though I had done most of the
testing already and the reason for that
is that there really isn't anything
particularly interesting or exciting to
talk about in terms of performance
improvements however since so many of
you demanded an update I decided to look
into it and at least we found one
interesting thing along the way so yeah
hopefully it won't be a complete waste
of time anyway before we get too far
into it this video is brought to you by
MSI and their new and upgraded
workstation laptops the MSI ws 65 in
particular is one that caught my
attention combining the excellent slim
and light aesthetics of their gaming
laptops with brand-new NVIDIA Quadro
RT X 5000 graphics for professionals on
the go that demand top in performance
the ws 65 also packs up to Intel Core
aligned processors loads of RAM a 4k
display and even a fingerprint scanner
for added security to learn more click
the links in the description below ok so
if you're sitting there wondering what
all the fuss is about this Windows 10
may update well let me explain
apparently Microsoft has done some work
to the Windows kernel to improve CPU
performance and namely for Rison and AMD
even recently showed in their e3
livestream that the update is in fact
optimized for Zen and it improves things
such as topology awareness and it speeds
up clock ramping the improved topology
awareness means that Windows will focus
on using calls with inner CCX before
using another CCX so basically the
teaming caused in the same CCX before
spreading the workload to another CCX as
doing so comes with a latency penalty
and then the faster clock ramping means
that rising can get up to speed faster
with previous builds of Windows AMD said
it could take around 30 milliseconds for
the CPU to ramp up to higher frequencies
so the update along with an upcoming
chipset driver will take this to just 1
to 2 milliseconds for the chip to reach
its top speed
AMD's also showed a slide claiming these
fixes can boost gaming performance by up
to 15% while the faster clock ramping
can yield a 6% and per
and I think this is partly why Rison
owners are so hyped about this update
however as I understand these
improvements aren't yet in effect and
they won't be tool as into processes
arrived and we get the new chipset
driver despite that though there are
claims all over the place from Rison
owners of improved performance but as
far as I can tell the gains shown have
been limited to 3dmark and that's a
synthetic benchmark application that we
tend to avoid here at harbor unboxed it
seems Rison owners are seeing
improvements in 3dmark scores and then
just assuming those gains will transfer
over to real-world games so yeah well
look at that in a moment but spoiler
alert if I hadn't already given it away
with the initial introduction to this
video the reason I was gonna skip it was
because all my results were within the
margin of error and I wasn't even
confident if any of these optimizations
that aim they're talking about are
actually active yet and after speaking
with the all-knowing Wendel of level one
techs if you haven't subscribed to level
one text then I suggest you do it I'll
stick a link in the video description
but after speaking to Wendell my
suspicions were confirmed at this point
it sounds like the Zen scheduler still
isn't enabled in the 1903 build and
again for this you will need the AMD
chipset driver the improved clock
ramping is also going to be enabled by
the upcoming chipset driver and possibly
even a firmware update will be needed
there not a hom percent sure on that one
Wendell also told me that he's heard
these n3 architecture will have a
hardware fix to address this issue
taking the current changes in clock
frequency from the current 30-plus
milliseconds down to just one to two
milliseconds anyway as I said earlier I
wasn't going to make this video because
there really isn't our thing to report
at least in terms of performance but due
to the large volume of requests for an
updated 1903 benchmark I've decided to
go ahead with the video actually it
wasn't just the sheer volume of requests
but rather all the misinformation I was
seeing quite a few of you are telling me
you've been told of big performance
improvements with the new update on
Rison and since that isn't really the
case at least not yet anyway
I thought a video is probably necessary
after all so I took the rise in 720 700
X and Rison 520 600 X tested them on
Windows using the 1809 Bill
then I updated and tested with the 1903
build and of course we ran all the tests
again for the graphics card I'm using
the gigabyte r-tx 20 atti or as extreme
and for the memory a 16 gigabyte kit of
G skills Flair exterior for 3200 cell 14
so let's take a look at the results
starting with Cinebench our 20 we see
similar scores for both processors using
either version of Windows 1809 or 1903
honestly I wasn't really expecting any
changes to have any impact on this
particular workload but I know you guys
will want some Cinebench scores anyway
here we can also see that the single
core performance was also the same so
again no surprises here
moving to WinRAR and we do see a two
percent performance improvement for the
2700 X and this is of course based on a
three run average it's hard to say if
the new Windows build is responsible for
such a small gain typically I'd consider
2% to be within the margin of error and
we can see that perhaps that is the case
here given the 2600 X is less than a 1%
improvement the last application I
bothered to look at was premiere again
nothing to report here at less than a 1%
difference for both CPUs all up I
benchmarked 10 games with obviously both
versions of Windows and there were no
noteworthy margins to speak of so I'm
not going to talk about each game
because as I said there's really nothing
to talk about I'll just cycle through
the graphs you've probably seen a few of
them by now so we'll just do that and
then I'll wrap this up at most we saw a
2% difference in performance and on
occasion the older 18:09 build was
faster but again we're talking about the
margin of error here results that are
within the margin of error so yeah
honestly there's no noticeable
performance difference in any of the
games tested I had also seen some people
claiming that the 19:03 build improves
performance of the first gen processors
so the original Zen processors and I
think that's because the slides that AMD
showed said Zen optimizations and not
Zen plus or Zen 2 but they just mean Zen
in general the Zen architecture which
encompasses all versions of Zen so yeah
these updates aren't targeting or are
providing bigger improvements for those
with first-generation Pro
but since I had the results for the
risin five 1600 I thought I would take a
look at the risin five 1600 on the 1903
build and again absolutely no difference
in performance I'm not going to show you
guys those graphs because they're just
more graphs that don't tell you anything
particularly useful but I can assure you
that the first gen and second gen Rison
processors all look the same
I will just say though it's possible
these windows optimizations are
currently offering noticeable gains for
the higher core count for every percy
per use can't comment on that yet
because I haven't tested them I believe
Wendell will be doing some testing with
the 29 9 WX soon yeah for now not sure
on that one of precious focused on the
a.m. for CPUs I also tested ARMA 3 at
the request of a few patreon members the
hope he was that the update would help
our performance in older titles where
rise and struggles a bit but yes sadly
that wasn't the case at least not yet
anyway now remember that slide from AMD
that I showed earlier in the video that
showed the risin 7 3800 X to be 15%
faster with the May 2019 update when
playing rocket League well I decided to
go back and do the testing all over
again so install an 1809 build then
update it and do that for both the 2600
X and 2700 X and well that allowed me to
test rocket League which I hadn't done
previously so I did this at 1080p using
the high quality settings again with an
RT X xx atti and I also removed the 250
FPS frame cap sadly though no 15% gain
for the 2,700 X or the 2600 X again will
probably need the new chipset driver for
those kinds of gains and then finally
moving on to one last thing what are all
these guys so excited about over on the
AMD reddit page improved 3dmark scores
apparently firstly I had to Google what
3d mark was then download a program on
Steam that simulates a game but isn't a
game we'd shit I know
and once I run this mysterious program a
few numbers were spat out in my favorite
web browser
okay so I'll cut the crap I know what 3d
mark is but I said we just don't use it
on the channel anyway drew my surprise
yeah
3d mark scores were boosted
significantly with the 1903 update and
here I was thinking all the bots on
reddit spent too much time looking at
porn on their pcs and they were infested
with malware apologies to the r / MD
community some of our patreon members
also saw the same thing big gains for
the total and physics scores and 3dmark
but zero improvement for every other
game and application they tested at
least nothing that was out of the margin
of error so if you're asking yourself
well what gives here I don't have any
real answer for you I guess either
3dmark was broken on Rison previously or
more likely there's a bug with 3d mark
when using the new version of Windows
either way doesn't really matter too
much as the performance uplift seen here
when running 3d mark has no bearing on
real-world gameplay so yeah that is a
bit of a shame overall it seems there's
really nothing to see here so yeah sorry
if you feel I've wasted your time on
this one just showing you graphs with
margin of error differences like I said
I was going to completely skip this
video as the testing was uninteresting
I'd done it anyway but yeah what didn't
really make for an exciting video but
yeah with so many people now hitting me
up on Twitter and comment section on
YouTube and pretty much everywhere over
the last few days freaking out about
these alleged improvements I thought it
probably made sense to make the video
anyway hopefully we will see some
improvements in the not-too-distant
future once we get the new chipset
driver and I hope is that clear on how
that will be rolled out there are
suggestions that's being rolled out by
the windows update some people may have
it already but I haven't seen anyone
showing any gains in well any
applications or games outside of 3d mark
and then a few people have shown cinema
j-15 scores to have changed but again
they're really within the margin of
error so yeah if there are any changes
or anything different to what we found
here then I'll certainly update this
information in a future video but as far
as we can tell at this point you
shouldn't be seeing any major
performance improvements with the 1903
update with horizon processor so for now
it just seems to be a bit of a hype
train so these Windows updates are often
followed by
i heiped rains back in late 2017 we did
derail the full creator update that was
said to improve performance by an insane
20% in reality it was more like a 0%
somewhere around there was only a couple
of percent at best so consider this hype
train derailed once again also please
note that these windows and Driver
optimizations aren't meant to improve
things that much it'll certainly help a
bit but you won't see the massive
performance gains that are being
reported by well programs such as 3d
mark for example it's not uncommon that
when these new windows updates are
rolled out that people see performance
improvements and for the most part
people who are seeing these performance
improvements are seeing them because
there was actually something wrong with
their previous install of Windows and
the update corrects that so those with a
clean operating system like what we've
tested with here today they should see
little to no performance change so again
if you are seeing some sort of big
change or a particular gamers showing
improvements don't necessarily assume it
that's the 1903 update it could just be
that there was something wrong
previously of course this time creating
a bit of extra excitement and confusion
was 3dmark but I've explained what I
think's going on there and again those
results don't transfer over to any other
real-world applications or games so yeah
just a synthetic benchmark doing
synthetic benchmark things but hopefully
we can put that one to rest now still it
will be interesting to see what
improvements this upcoming AMD chipset
driver might deliver but yeah I wouldn't
be expecting any miracles we're not
expecting to see any huge changes here
just a nice little performance bump
where perhaps horizon needed at most but
again we'll just have to wait and see
what really happens when we get that
drive up and that is going to do it for
this one if you did enjoy the video be
sure to the like button subscribe for
more content and if you appreciate what
we do or how I box then consider
supporting us on patreon this video
ended up being quite a bit of work quite
a lot of installing windows updating
windows reinstalling Windows updating
windows doing all that kind of stuff I
didn't just roll back to go back and
forth on the testing because that can
cause other problems so yeah
a lot of hours were wasted installing
and updating windows and then not to
mention all the applications required
for testing so if you appreciate that
you can jump over to our patreon account
and that also gives you access to our
discord chat we can chat to you guys
while we're doing this kind of testing
see what you're seeing and sort of work
with you on that one and actually our
patreon members were very helpful in
this one because they were also seeing
the big 3d mark performance uplifted as
ice as I said but they weren't seeing
gains anywhere else so I suppose also
thank you to our patreon members who
helps me on this one as always we very
much appreciate you guys anyway thank
you to everyone who watched this video
I'm your host Steve and I'll see you
again next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
