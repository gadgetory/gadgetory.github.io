checking out my favorite be 450
motherboards
it's another top 5 video and the
categories for this one include best
ultra cheap best value or rounder best
of the best so and no compromises sort
of option their best micro ATX and best
mini ITX so let's get into it
so I'm making this video the most
affordable be 450 boards are coming in
around $70 us while the cheapest be 350
boards are about $10 cheaper so once be
350 stock runs out you can expect to be
450 models to drop down a little bit in
price and right now we have asrock MSI
and gigabyte or offering entry-level
boards a sous does have well an
entry-level board but in typical a sous
fashioned their version costs about 30%
more with no justification for the price
premium so we have the asrock be for 50m
HDV the msi be for 50m pro 2 and the
gigabyte be for 50m ds3 H since gigabyte
spent their entire budget on chokes that
they don't actually need we're going to
ignore the ds3 H which is a shame
because that board does pack four dimm
slots but given their veremos on the B
450 boards I just can't touch them or
recommend them at this point then we
have as rocks entry-level board which
looks much better and packs a similar
verum configuration to that of the
flagship a Seuss and gigabyte be 450
boards which is a bit embarrassing for a
soos and gigabyte the same is also true
for the MSI B 450m pro 2 but I'm going
to pick the Azeroth board because it
features a heatsink on the V Corps vrm
other than that though the asrock and
msi boards are really similar so if you
can't get your hands on the Azeroth
board then the msi board will make for a
nice backup I also prefer asrock to UEFI
design so their BIOS I just think the
layout and feature sets a lot better
than that of MSI's and in my opinion
this is one area where MSI does need to
up their game overall though solid entry
levels from both asrock and msi but I
think the Azeroth board will be sort of
the perfect entry level option and it
will work nicely with horizon 7 at 2700
X I said if you do plan on overclocking
I highly recommend you spend a little
bit more money and at least to get our
best advantage so what's going to talk
about that one
if possible I recommend avoiding the
entry level bullets and just pony up an
extra $40 u.s. I realize that it is a
pretty big step up in price but you do
get a significantly higher quality
motherboard that'll handle any rise in
CPU thright up with ease the extra
investment will also open you up to
multiple options and the best include
the as rocker be 450 gaming K for the
MSI B 450 gaming plus and my personal
favorite the MSI B 450 tomahawk are the
options from a soos and gigabyte not
really good enough to consider in my
opinion which is why I'm only mentioning
boards from asrock and msi for me though
the msi be 450 tomahawk is the standout
here at PAX an impressive feature set
and at 110 dollars us you just can't be
beat at least in my opinion it's also a
nice neutral looking board in terms of
its design whereas the previous tomahawk
had some red highlights and whatever MSI
is just gone for a black gray theme this
time and with a dash of RGB lighting it
will suit all occasions that said if you
can afford it our no compromise option
which is just $20 more and now it's
another bump up in price but frankly it
is worth every penny but we'll get to
that one in a moment still if you're
stretching the budget as it is the
tomahawk is a reasonable compromise and
really a great board for the mid-range
you essentially get everything you'd
need or typically want from a desktop
motherboard with the addition of a
higher quality veeram that operates at
safe temperatures even with an
overclocked rising 7 processor it's
great to see that MSI didn't skimp on
the verum components and they certainly
didn't skimp on the cooling either
providing nice being heat sinks on both
the vcore and SOC verum and the best bit
is the heat sinks haven't been covered
in some tacky looking plastic shroud so
if you can stretch your budget to about
$100 u.s. then I highly recommend
checking out the MSI B 450 tomahawk it
really is hands down the best and value
all-rounder
I don't think there'll be many that can
hug you with that
something you still can't find is a
micro ATX X 470 motherboard so those
after a 400 series chipset board but in
the micro ATX form factor will be B 450
shopping there are quite a few to choose
from an MSI alone has half a dozen
options and I really like the look of
the B 450m mortar which will be
available in black or white there are
certainly some nice-looking micro ATX
p450 boards from em aside but I think as
Rock has outdone them here the arse
rocker B 450m pro 4 comes in at just $80
us and while it might only pack a three
plus three phase varium both the V Corps
and SOC portions of the very few passive
cooling something no other micro ATX be
450 board offers cooling on the SOC VRM
is important particularly if you plan on
overclocking the Raven Ridge apu and
more crucially if you plan overclocking
integrated Vega GPU for the Rison 5 and
Rison 7 series this is less important
but even so the asrock board is still
better in terms of features it does pack
2 m 2 slots a full length PCIe x 16 slot
though of course it is only wide for 4 x
bandwidth and you also get four dimm
slots for Siler ports and even a USB
type-c ports so for well under $100 USD
as rocker be 450m pro 4 is a cracking
good motherboard and hands-down the best
value micro ATX option in fact in many
respects is the best micro ATX p450
board
okay the best to be 450 mini lights
board there are just three options here
the as rocker be 450 gaming ITX AC the
MSI be 450 I gaming plus AC and the
isuzu ROG Strix be 450 I gaming has to
be said there soos model is quite a nice
looking board but it will ultimately end
up being too expensive for what it is I
am anticipating an asking price of
around $150 u.s. and it's really not
that much better than what the
competitors are offering for much less
in fact you could argue that for $120
u.s. MSI is offering a better board MSI
has gone with a more powerful three
phase of eco avaran featuring a double
or four six actual phasers that said the
SOC veeram is quite weak so not an ideal
board for an APU seuss is probably
better in that regards though if you're
planning on running an APU the suit
boards probably too expensive and what
makes sense anyway the Ezreal p450
gaming ITX AC packs a three plus two
phase variant which for some reason as
ROC calls an eight phase-- VRM don't
know what the deal with that is but
hopefully we get this sort of stuff
sorted out and the not-too-distant
future
anyway what as rocks offering isn't a
bad board but for $10 less the MSI model
is world's better in my opinion so for
me the MSI beefed up if the I gaming +
AC is the obvious choice here and for
the price it simply can't be beat
okay so the best of the best the
no-compromise motherboard who makes the
ultimate be 450 motherboard well this
one is actually the easiest category to
work out because it's quite simply MSI
with their be 450 gaming Pro carbon
dammit guys can we just agree to drop
gaming from the name of every product
yeah seriously though this really is the
ultimate be 450 motherboard and for just
a hundred and thirty dollars us it's a
steal in fact it might very well be the
best aim for motherboard price below
$200 us certainly below 170 dollars us
anyway as a consequence MSI has managed
to outdo themselves in this one it's a
better board and a better buy than
almost all of their X 470 models as such
as the X 470 gaming plus X 470 Pro and
even the $180 us X 470 gaming Pro carbon
power delivery for the X 470 Pro carbon
is slightly better it's a 5 plus 2 phase
varium while the be 450 Pro carbon packs
a 4 plus 2 phase varium both have double
the components though but no proper a
doubling mechanism I'd argue that the
cooling of the be 450 board is better
though it sports a bigger heat sink and
isn't intruded upon by a plastic shroud
in my opinion the be 450 version is a
better Buy not just because it's almost
30% cheaper but because you get Intel
dual band wireless AC and Bluetooth 5.0
and the only thing missing are 2 SATA
ports our third PCIe x 16 slot but I
think it's very unlikely that many of
you are going to miss those features oh
and for those of you wondering the be
450 Pro carbon uses the RT 88-90 for a
control the same as the tomahawk and
packs a total of 8 on semiconductor high
side for c02 nine fetes and eight low
side for c0 24 fits for the vcore veeram
again this is a four phase vehicle with
no double ax the only problem with MSI's
b4 15 X 470 motherboards at this point
in time is their complete lack of
voltage offset options in the BIOS this
means for now it's not possible to make
full use of precision boost overdrive
other than that though MSI has developed
the ultimate be 450 motherboard with
there be 450 gaming Pro carbon well they
have it
top five B 450 motherboards sadly this
time around there just aren't as many
good budget
AMD motherboards as I would have liked
certainly not as many as there could
have been anyway gigabyte and a sous
really do disappoint this time around as
rocks done a decent job but it's msi
who's really turned things around
anyway I hope these pics really help you
narrow down the search for the perfect
be 450 motherboard for your next build
as always if you happen to agree or
disagree jump down the comment section
below let me know why or let me know
anything really just put whatever you
want down in the comment section below
and that is gonna do it for this one I'm
yo Steve see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
