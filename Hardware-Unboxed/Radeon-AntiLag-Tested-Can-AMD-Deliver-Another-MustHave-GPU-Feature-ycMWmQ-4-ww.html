know alongside the release of AMD's
brand new na'vi GPUs the company rolled
out two new features in their Radeon
drivers suite last week I looked at one
of those features Radeon image
sharpening and today I'm back to do an
in-depth analysis of the second and
that's Radeon anti-lag the basic goal of
Radeon anti-lag is to reduce input lag
while gaming input lag is the delay
between when you make an input like a
mouse click or key press and when the
action takes place on your display for
fast-paced competitive games especially
shooters like csgo
over what or fortnight it's key to have
the lowest possible input lag so you can
spot your enemies target them with your
weapon and shoot them as quickly and
smoothly as possible
input lag is a combination of many
factors some involve your peripheral
hardware like your monitor mouse and
keyboard some involve how fast your CPU
and GPU are at processing frames but
Radeon anti lag is primarily focused
with reducing lag in the driver stage
and I think AMD do a great job of
explaining how it works in more detail
so I'll quote them here games produce
frames of animation by pairing work done
on the CPU with work done on the GPU the
CPU begins its work first and it feeds
work to the GPU as it works its way
through a frame in most use cases the
GPU workload is the primary performance
constraint we call this a GPU limited
scenario in such scenarios games perform
the CPU work at least one frame ahead of
the GPU work resulting in two frames of
latency in total the delay between the
click of the mouse register during the
CPU work for the frame and the response
on the screen produced by the GPU can
expand to cover the time required for
the GPU to process two full frames or
more at 60fps that delay is 33.3
milliseconds
two frames at sixteen point seven
milliseconds each or more in such cases
Radeon anti-lag dynamically improves the
pacing of the CPU work allowing the CPU
work to overlap a significant portion of
the GPU work
so the CPU doesn't get too far ahead of
the GPU as a result Radeon anti-lag can
in theory shrink input lag by almost a
full frame nearly sixteen point seven
milliseconds at 60 fps
restoring responsiveness to you again
the impact is quicker response times and
a more direct connection between your
actions and the results shown on screen
so that's basically the gist of it radio
an anti-glare can reduce input lag by up
to a full frame according to AMD when
mostly GPU limited and we'll get into
the implications of this when we put up
some beautiful blue graphs for now
there's a few other things to talk about
one is that Radian anti-lag works on any
recent AMD GPU or AP so not just new
navi gps however it only works in
DirectX 11 titles unless you have an RV
GPU in which case it also works for
DirectX 9 no AMD GPU supports this
technology in DirectX 12 Vulcan or
OpenGL a lot of popular competitive
games have dx11 modes that's not
necessarily a bad thing but naturally as
more games begin to use new api's ready
an anti lag will need to evolve to also
support them there are three ways to
enable anti-lag one is via the game
profile settings another is via Radeon
overlay and that's the method I'm most
commonly used and the last is via the
alt L global shortcut in all three cases
it's just a simple toggle and gets to
work right away even in game for testing
I decided to measure the entire clip to
response input lag using the same
testing tools as for my monitor review
so this is a photo detector placed on
the screen as well as a mouse input both
hooked up directly to an oscilloscope
using this method we can record the
precise time we ask a game to do
something like shoot a weapon and then
the precise time this action is shown on
the screen we expect radio and antenna
to have the lowest response time numbers
over a 20 sample average for each test
the hardware for testing is also fast
for the GPU I've used ambe's new Radeon
rx 5700 XT paired with Intel's Core I
$9.99 hundred K which remains the
fastest CPU for gaming I've then used
the fastest display I have on hand pic
series brand new px5 Hayabusa there are
reviews coming on that soon which is a
1080p 240 Hertz display with 0.6
millisecond response times so let's
start the testing here with Rainbow six
siege as you can see I've tested three
different modes we've got vsync on
facing off and freesync on with both
Radeon aunty lag enabled and disabled
doing input lag testing takes a lot of
time so I'm not going to go into a heap
of games
but the ones I do have including Rainbow
six siege should cover most bases this
is a game that generally has very low
input latency part of this is because it
runs extremely well I was pushing above
200 FPS in my testing with that much
sweat and high frame rates have a
significant impact in reducing input
latency so across the board here we're
pretty much in that 17 to 22
milliseconds of input latency zone which
is lightning-quick
Radeon anti-lag did produce consistently
faster results for two of the three test
conditions for vsync off were shaved off
2.3 milliseconds and for free sync we
shaved off about 2 milliseconds there
was no difference for vsync on gaming
not that would recommend using vsync for
any input lag sensitive games given the
game was running at around 220 fps in
this testing it seems ready auntie lag
shaved off around half of frames worth
of latency with each frame lasting 4.5
milliseconds at this framerate now a 2.3
millisecond reduction or 13% improvement
to input latency doesn't sound all that
impressive but there's a few things to
keep in mind
AMD did say that we can expect up to
around a single frame of latency
improvement however given we are gaming
at such a high frame rate to begin with
that one frame isn't actually all that
much latency
ambi also said anti-lag works best when
games a GPU limited and when running it
over 200 FPS generally the CPU is
already doing quite a bit of the work
I've also got results here from an
NVIDIA GeForce r-tx 2070 playing the
game at the same framerate so around the
220 FPS mark input latency was a little
high in general so anti lag does provide
the best overall performance however
given we're only talking about a formula
ii difference it's not a significant
result in my opinion next up we have
fortnight and again this is a game
that's going to run really well on most
hardware even playing the game on the
epic preset at 1080p I was achieving 170
FPS or so during testing so a lot of the
same issues as Rainbow six siege are
present here Radio Nancy lag was
consistently faster in the range of 2 to
4 milliseconds better but with frames
coming in every five point nine
milliseconds or so we simply aren't
going to get much more of a reduction in
input latency in fact AMD says that the
benefits of Radio Nancy lag are most
pronounced when gaming between 60
90 FPS and in the two games we've tested
so far even with maximum quality
settings I was easily more than double
that sort of framerate this is pretty
important to know and will factor into
the conclusion in just a moment or two
but before that I did wanna test a game
I knew would hit AMD's sweet spot zone
and that's Metro Exodus in this title I
set the game to the extreme preset and
was hitting around 75 FPS in our test
area and as expected the advantages to
ride an ante lag were more obvious here
I saw a reduction in input lag of
between four point six and ten point six
milliseconds depending on the sync
method used with that latter number
showing that we're getting near a full
frame reduction in Metro Exodus at these
frame rates achieving 18% better
performance or a 15% reduction in input
lag is a strong result compared to what
we've seen the final game I found really
interesting was battlefield 5 this game
has a mode called future frame rendering
in which you can switch off for better
latency according to the in-game
information so for testing I set that
mode to off as and went about comparing
anti-lag on and off as it turns out ANSI
lag has next to no effect when this mode
is already enabled so it seems that at
least for this title running in its dx11
mode developer EA dice had already
figured out how to minimize input
latency and implemented their own toggle
so yeah that's kind of neat now you
might be wondering if Radeon anti-lag
improves input lag in games why isn't
this just enabled by default is there
any downside and the answer to that is
yes but in some situations it's not
really a significant downside I tested a
number of games with Radeon anti-lag on
and off to see the performance impact
several of these had a negligible
performance drop we're talking one fps
in Metro Exodus 3 FPS in rainbow 6 siege
less than 1 FPS in resident evil 2 and
no difference in battlefield 5 all
looking at average frame rates the
impact of 1% lowest could be anywhere
from delivering a consistent improvement
to lowering performance slightly however
there were also some tiles where the
performance impact was more substantial
in fortnight I saw a 6% drop to
performance or 7 fps looking at average
frame rates with an even larger drop to
1% lows the hit was even larger in
hitman 2 at over 11% MD says it isn't
unusual to see a performance impact in
titles but not others so your mileage
will vary certainly sometimes you can
enable anti-lag without worrying and
other times the hit will be noticeable
so that's the testing I managed to get
done for this video sorry it wasn't a
bit more comprehensive but to get this
level of consistency and accuracy with
input load testing it does take a lot of
repetition and results in any case I
think it paints an interesting picture
and there's a few things I want to
discuss so firstly it's clear that
Radeon anti-lag it does what it sets out
to do ambi said it delivers about a one
frame improvement input lag in GPU
limited scenarios and works best when
gaming in the sixty to ninety FPS range
and that's exactly what I found in high
frame rate situations you might get a
two to four millisecond improvement
which is up to one frame and then at
lower frame rates I saw up to a ten
millisecond improvement the trade-off is
in some games you will see a performance
impact in others you won't - just varies
a bit this is all fine it works it's
good but I just don't think is this
important or revolutionary as ambu
suggested is let's look at this chart in
particular from their Radeon anti-lag
website which shows a range of
competitive games receiving twenty to
thirty five percent reductions to input
latency with anti-lag enables why is
this different to my testing well that's
because only tested these games running
at 60 to 90 fps rather than the hundreds
of frames per second you'd normally
expect in fact if you look at the fine
print
ambi says they're tested with the core
i7 9700 K which is a fast gaming CPU but
chose to use the 3840 by 2160 resolution
aka 4k now normally don't have any
problem with that
testing games at 4k is fine some people
will be playing at 4k but they're your
more casual quality focus gamers who
want the best visuals competitive gamers
who are highly sensitive to input
latency the target for a feature like
Radeon anti-lag definitely will not or
at least should not be gaming at 4k the
reason for that is gaming at 4k
considerably reduces your framerate
compared to playing at a lower
resolution like 1080p and one of the
simplest ways to reduce input latency is
to increase the frame rate this is why
most serious competitive gamers play at
1080p low settings with high refresh
rate displays and fast CPUs they're
often CPU limited and playing at 200
plus FPS to ensure their gameplay is
smooth responsive and
minimally affected by input lag so with
the proper gaming setup for low latency
performance and I didn't go especially
overboard to achieve this in my testing
in fact I often used ultra quality
settings as opposed to low-quality
sayings radio and Auntie lag is only
going to deliver maybe a 5 millisecond
or so reduction to input latency for
highly sensitive game is this well it
might be a big deal but I certainly
could not tell the difference when
gaming although I'm not the sort of
person that is overly sensitive to input
lag to begin with the only conclusion I
can come to is Radeon anti-lag really
isn't designed for true competitive
gamers that wants super low input
latency because the gains you get in
latency toon scenarios are minimal this
leaves it in kind of a weird position
now don't get me wrong it's not a bad
feature or useless or anything like that
if you are casually gaming in that 60 to
90 FPS zone for whatever reason and you
just want a reduction in input latency
great you can now hit a button and shave
off maybe 10 to 15 milliseconds but if
you're more serious about reducing input
lag you'll get a much bigger improvement
out of simply increasing your framerate
and that could be by lowering the
settings in battlefield 5 for example
toning down some settings and going from
70 to 120 fps shaved off 22 milliseconds
of input lag and delivered smoother
gameplay and that's what I'd recommend
doing first but in the process of course
it will diminish the advantage you can
get from anti lag I guess in the end I
was hoping radio Nancy lag would be a
significant feature for those who are
most concerned about input lag the
highly competitive skilled latency
sensitive gamers the ones that research
input lag and optimize their setups
accordingly instead while it does have a
minor impact for those gamers ranty lag
is more suited to improving the casual
gaming experience which I'm not sure
cares about a one frame input latency
reduction all that much especially if
there's a potential for a drop in
framerate the one use case I could see
this being handy for other competitive
gamers who have low-end Hardware maybe a
risin 530 400 G or something like that
who would already be playing at 1080p
low settings on the integrated graphics
and sitting around that framerate sweet
spot for Radio Nancy lag with nowhere
lower to go in terms of getting better
frame rates it could be a handy toggle
to reduce input latency further maybe
that's something to explore in a future
video anyway that's it on Radio anti-lag
for now
to hear your thoughts in the comments
below and how useful this sort of thing
will be for you whether that one-frame
improvement is something that you're
after and whether you'll be tolerating
that performance it in some titles
