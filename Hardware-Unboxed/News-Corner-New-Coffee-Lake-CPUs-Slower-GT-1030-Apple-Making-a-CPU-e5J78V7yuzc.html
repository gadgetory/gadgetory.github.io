corner this week we'll be discussing the
rest of Intel's coffee Lake
announcements from a couple of days ago
news that Apple might be developing a
CPU so that they can ditch Intel Nvidia
releasing a slower GT 1030 and a new
nvme SSD from Western Digital so earlier
this week you hopefully saw our coverage
of two key launches from Intel their new
budget 300 series chipsets like the b-36
T and H 370 and six core coffee like
laptop CPUs for the H series well
alongside those launchers Intel also
announced a collection of other stuff
including new desktop CPUs and new
laptop CPUs with iris graphics there
have been various leaks surrounding the
new desktop CPUs for some time but now
they are official in the core line we
have several key additions the core i5
8600 and Core i5 8500 both of which are
six core 6 thread parts with clock
speeds and prices that place in between
the i-5 8600 K and i-5 8400 then in the
core i3 line we have the quad core i3
8300 which is basically a 100 megahertz
faster I 3 8100 and that will cost you
an extra $21 so it's not as good value
with some of those core i5s but it does
bridge the gap between the 80 183 50k in
the Pentium Gold Line we have three main
cpus with two cores and four threads the
g 5400 g 5500 and g 5600 each 11 dollars
apart in pricing with clock speeds
between 3.7 and 3.9 gigahertz then in
the seller online we have the g 4900 and
g 4920 as two core to thread parts
occupying the 42 and 52 dollar price
points you probably would have seen in
these tables new t-series processes as
well which all 35 watt variants of the
processes we've mentioned
usually the most popular among PC
builders but they do exist for power and
thermal constrained devices on the
mobile front we have four new twenty
eight what you serious processes with
iris plus graphics the core i7 8559 you
the core i5 82-69 you and the core i5
8259 you and there all four core eight
thread CPUs with beefy forty eight
execution unit GPUs and there's also the
two core four thread core i3 80 109 new
which features a forty seven EU GPU
interestingly while these are 8th gen
you series parts they're technically
using the coffee lake architecture
instead of cable oak refresh which is
used for the rest of the you series non
iris processes and with that extra TDP
Headroom compared to K Blake refresh
these coffee like you serious parts also
clock high on the CPU which is nice to
see enough talk about new Intel stuff
let's talk about in video quietly
launching a new version of the GeForce
GT 1030 that uses ddr4 memory instead of
gddr5 in fact that isn't the only change
the ddr4 version also has a lower 20
watt TDP instead of 30 watts with
reduced bass and boost GPU clocks
relative to the full power variant and
of course moving to 2 gig of ddr4
instead of the faster gddr5 also
severely limits memory bandwidth clock
speed reductions do vary depending on
the GT 1030 model we're looking at but
in the case of ms is GT 1030 the base
clock gets cut from twelve sixty five to
11 18 nine megahertz and the boost clock
drops from fifteen eighteen to fourteen
thirty megahertz and that's a long sight
a drop in memory bandwidth from 48 to
just sixteen point eight gigabytes per
second annoyingly these two variants of
the GT 1030 are both called the GT 1030
so there's no way to know which version
you are buying unless you specifically
look for the memory configuration or
watch for a d4 designator somewhere in
the product name I couldn't find any
ddr4 variants for sale on Newegg just
yet so it's unclear what sort of price
saving you'll get with the slower
version but you can expect it to be
shaved off
couple of dollars a rumor from Bloomberg
emerged earlier this week suggesting
Apple are planning to replace Intel CPUs
in their Mac's with their own processes
beginning as early as 2020 the project
codenamed kalamata has been ticked off
by executives and is still in the early
stages of development so there's not a
whole lot of information in this report
but apparently Apple are making this
move so all of their devices including
iPhones and iPads work more seamlessly
together part of this plan involves
software including a new platform
codenamed marzipan that will allow users
to run iOS apps on Macs how Apple
transitions from Intel CPUs to their own
CPUs remains unclear however if their
plan is to make Mac's run more similarly
to iPhones and iPads you'd think they
are looking at shifting max from x86
processors to arm and that will create
all sorts of complications as we already
know that emulating x86 apps on arm CPUs
isn't exactly a great solution maybe
Apple has a magic up their sleeves but
we'll just have to wait and see intel
has finished their Spector patch rollout
releasing the final patches for older
CPUs while canceling the rollout for
some product lines the end result comes
down to this all 2nd gen core processors
and newer in other words Sandy Bridge
onward have patches available for
Spectre Penryn core to processes and
anything earlier were originally
scheduled to be patched but not anymore
as Intel has canceled their development
it gets a bit more tricky when looking
at first gen core processors in the
Nehalem and Westmere lines here about
half of the CPU families will get
patched while some will no longer
receive Spectre fixes the core i7 900
series CPUs from both lines will not get
patched while the mobile processes in
the hilum line will also not get patched
everything else though from those two
lines it does have a patch available on
top of this a range of old zealand
processors will not receive patches and
while it is a bit disappointing that not
every vulnerable processor will be
protected from Spectre the only cpus
that we remain are patched are pretty
old and hailing for example was released
in 2008 and west me in 2010
so if you're using a CPU from 8 to 10
years ago it's probably time to update
it anyway
Vega 20 has appeared in an ID list in a
Linux driver patch
yep that's just about all there is to
this story someone looked through the ID
list and there were some references to
Vega 20 the current line of products
including Vega 56 and Vega 64 falls
under the Vega 10 ID list so it is
possible Vega 20 are newer or in some
way refreshed versions of current Vega
products but who knows this is just a
list of ID's Western Digital has
released a new nvme SSD imaginatively
called the WD black nvme SSD not to be
confused with the WD black SSD released
in 2017 this new drive is also branded
as the SanDisk Extreme Pro M not - nvm
III the SSD anyway these drives are
available at 250 500 gigabyte and one
terabyte capacities for 120 230 and 450
dollars respectively in PC perspectives
review Allen Mello Anton who says these
SSDs have outstanding performance and a
competitive cost per gigabyte figure
making them a great option for those
after an enthusiasts SSD so that's
something to keep in mind if you're
after a new nvme SSD in great news for
the graphics card market bit main has
announced an aetherium ASIC minor that
will be available in mid-july the aunt
minor III assic will provide 180 meters
per second of mining performance for
just $800 which makes mining on GPUs a
complete waste of time for this
particular cryptocurrency apparently you
need nine gtx 1060 s to get that sort of
performance which would cost thousands
of dollars with current prices so when
this asset minor is released GPUs won't
be as sought-after for theory and mining
of course this doesn't necessarily mean
the GPU market will return to normal
straightaway as might as you know they
could just repurpose their GPUs to mine
a different cryptocurrency but when
these sorts of products have hit the
market in the past we have seen GPUs
flood into the used market and GPU
prices take a dip so hopefully that
happens this time as well final news
topic for this week razor has launched a
digital game store
yep for some reason razor now has a game
store luckily if you buy games in this
store you'll just get steam or you play
keys so you won't have to install yet
another game launcher and manage another
library of PC games
apparently the razor game still will
have a lot of games from major
publishers and feature exclusive
discounts and there are rewards tied to
said gold and said silver or something
so interesting news from Razer and of
course you can check out their game
still have a link to this that in the
description below that's it for this
week's news corner subscribe to get this
