of thin air today we have a hell of a
news story for you one that's going to
get you smashing the like button faster
than ever in fact you might get so
excited if you get to the like button at
all
so do that now before I spill the beans
so you thought it wasn't coming for a
long time from now you thought it was
gonna be called a gtx 1180 you thought
you'd heard it all well you're wrong
recently we've heard reports of a major
OEMs and GPUs to Nvidia believed to be
an over order during the cryptocurrency
mining boom which is now mostly stopped
booming and is just it's just doing that
now it's not doing that anymore just
actually it's probably more like just
just doing that however this massive
shipment of GPUs was actually from tsmc
and not a major OEMs all look pretty
much the same so you can understand the
confusion
this makes far more sense because we
know that the next generation of GPUs
will be launching next month and we know
this because of booth babe we spin it in
Tim's ear at Computex what you don't
know is that due to poor yields on the
seven animator process in videos going
with the 12 nanometer process but it
gets even worse than that we've long
suspected a Pascal refresh and we've now
received confirmation that the parts
coming next month will be codenamed
Pascal Plus but what exactly does Pascal
Plus mean though well we know NVIDIA has
been working on their own multi chip
designs to combat AMD's future plans but
what we didn't know is in a video we're
putting that plan into action with
Pascal plus Pascal plus is quite simply
Pascal plus another Pascal GPU the GTX
20/80
that's right it's not going to be called
the 1180 I can confirm this through
trusted sources within the company that
Nvidia is going with the 20 series
anyway we've heard reports that the gtx
1180 now known officially as the 2080 as
i just said we'll have 3584 CUDA cores
the same amount as the gtx 10a
ETI and NVIDIA Titan X well turns out
that is completely wrong it will
actually pack an incredible 4860 for
CUDA cores can you believe it we hardly
can this massive core count is all
thanks to the Pascal plus Pascal design
using in videos latest impose a chips
everyone including us thought the
GeForce GTX 1072 I was a joke when in
video released at late last year what
was the bloody point well we now know
Nvidia develop the more cost-effective
GPUs so that they could later shrink it
down on the 12 nanometer process and
then stick two of them together to
create the beastly 4860 for cuda core
gtx 2080 this means we're expecting a
massive 40% performance increase over
the gtex 1080i only a 15% increase in
power draw and there is also going to be
a GTX 20/80 Big Boss Edition they'll
come in a white box feature 5120 cuda
cores and 128 gigabytes of gddr5 sin 3d
mark $19.99 is it actually any good
though it's hard to say really
now I know what you're all thinking what
are these new GeForce GPU is going at
custome well fear not we do have the
answer to that one we've heard all the
rumors $700 us $1,000 u.s. even $1,500
us well we wish any one of those rumors
was correct this is because Nvidia is
going with a new pricing scheme that's
tied directly to the product name so the
GTX 20/80 will actually cost two
thousand and eighty dollars us and if
you think that's bad we'll just wait for
the next generation Nvidia has told us
directly that they will be sticking with
this new pricing structure until AMD
releases a GPU that's vaguely in the
same league and that is gonna do it for
this one if you haven't worked out by
now this video is just a joke obviously
none of this stuff is true we're just
having a bit of fun with the endless
stream of gtx 1180 rumour videos that
had just been released
relentlessly over the past month or so
a lot of these rumors are just made up
so we figured we can make up some stuff
as well a full credit though to our
patreon members for coming up with this
silly idea hope you guys enjoyed it on a
serious note though all of our industry
contacts that would comment have said in
video will be releasing or at the very
least announcing the next generation of
GPUs on July 30th so if true not that
long to wait now but you we're not going
to make an official video about it
because there is no official information
but you can expect that they'll probably
be a few dozen new rumors pop up between
now and then anyway thanks for watching
this silly video I hope you did enjoy it
and you got a few laughs out of it and
we will be back with some real content
tomorrow I'm your host Steve and I'll
see you again next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
