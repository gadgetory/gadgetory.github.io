brand new Kingston HyperX revolver on
hand this new gaming peripheral looks to
be geared towards first-person shooters
wait what this isn't the right revolver
right sorry about that guys this is the
brand new HyperX cloud revolver gaming
headset what a mouthful some acts are
tough to follow and Kingston got it so
right with the original cloud headset
that some actually preferred it over
there extremely good in its own right
HyperX cloud to successor both models
ranked very highly with uses pro gamers
and professional reviewers in terms of
sound quality microphone performance and
perhaps most notably comfort in fact
when I reviewed the cloud tubes not so
long ago the comments section was
swarmed with users commenting along the
lines of best headset I've ever owned
which was quite telling
now HyperX is back with the sequel to
their already impressive gaming headset
line and honestly I've been dying to get
my hands on them so without further ado
I present the HyperX cloud revolver the
unboxing experience is very similar to
that of the cloud 2 before it we get a
nice message welcoming us to the HyperX
team again and then the headset is
concealed beneath a layer of charcoal
firm the contents of the box is simple
this time around we've just put the
headset itself the detachable microphone
and the USB adapter cable no airplane
adapter this time around but I think we
can live without it the headset itself
is a little heavier than the cloud twos
coming in at 360 grams without the mic
compared to the 320 grams of its
predecessor this small amount of extra
weight is probably partly jus the black
steel frame that wraps around the
headset this frame feels tough and looks
good and it also gives me a lot of
confidence in the durability of the
headset to survive even the worst of
rage quits attached to the steel frames
the self adjusting headband featuring an
embossed HyperX logo red stitching and
the signature HyperX red memory foam
wrapped in a very soft to touch leather
at the headband slides up smoothly and
easily to adjust your head size and
wraps across your dome gently at each
end of the framework is a cool looking
glossy HyperX logo and of course the ear
cups themselves throughout a few minor
details here that are
estimate once again to high practices
attention to detail while the e cups are
closed design there are small vents on
each side to improve the sound delivery
of the low ends especially and you'll
also find some small rubber pads to
prevent the ear cups from scratching and
making any loud plastic on plastic noise
and being swiveled around
there's also mesh deep inside the ear
cup frame to soften the movement and
sound of the ear cup swivel to the ear
cup padding of course features the
HyperX memory foam too and when you pop
them off its red color is revealed along
with the new angle drivers I really hope
the revolver would be at least as
comfortable as the cloud two's were and
I can honestly say they're at least as
good if not better with the new self
adjusting headband and steel frame
design the original cloud and cloud
tubes were both built on the foundations
of the cupid qh9 II headset but this
time Kingston had built a revolver from
the ground up cases main objective here
was to build a headset with a much wider
soundstage and I can say they've done a
pretty great job the angled 50
millimeter neodymium drivers sound
fantastic and I test them with both my
onboard audio and through the Sound
Blaster x g5 headphone amp in a variety
of games coupled with the g5 I think
they produced the best sound I've heard
out of a gaming headset and the widest
soundstage was certainly noticeable even
without the g5 the sound quality was
great and the broad soundstage really
does give a more natural feeling
surround sound effect which is
especially helpful in competitive gaming
and more immersive for all types of
games the lowest mids and highs were all
strong in the cloud revolver and they
honestly sounded great for movies music
and gaming the detachable and noise
cancelling microphone is quite long and
sits just to the left of the front of my
mouth I recorded this section of the
audio using it to give you guys a bit of
a sample and the recording has been kept
absolutely raw
using just onboard audio all reports
were good for my skype friends and
gaming teammates and I'd have to say
it's about as good as you can expect
from a gaming headset now here's the
part where I'm going to get a bit
nitpicky I think it's great the mic is
detachable but it would have been even
better if I was able to follow it away
as well I found that when I was popping
the headphones off I'd have to turn them
around awkwardly so the mic wasn't under
them getting bent as I sat him down on
my desk also similarly to the cloud and
cloud twos before it the revolvers the
ear cups don't swivel 90 degrees to sit
flat on the desk or when you sit them
around your neck finally I found there's
quite a lot of reverb
down there cup frame and into the ear
cups and Handley you're bumping into it
for instance if you tap it like this it
sounds like a ringing Bell in your ears
none of these things are huge issues
though just little things that I noticed
and ideally would hope to be different
overall the revolver is a fantastic
sequel to the cloud tubes before it and
I'm really impressed with what Kingston
have produced from the ground up they've
been successful in creating a wider
soundstage and maintaining the excellent
build quality of their predecessor if
anything they're more comfortable thanks
to the suspension style headband system
and I can honestly recommend them to any
gamer looking for a headset with awesome
all-round sound and a high quality mic
that should last the test of time I
don't have exact pricing information for
the HyperX revolver at this stage
however I think if it comes in at around
120 US dollars and that'll be fitting
and I hopefully we can get a somewhere
around 170 dollar enews in Australia if
they're any more affordable than this at
launch and I'll certainly be
recommending them to everybody thanks
for joining me for another gaming
headset review let me know what you
think in the comments and I'll see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
