finally getting around to one of those
videos I guess it's been heavily
requested over the past year or so and
that is an overview and comparison of
the three main monitor technologies I
think some of you have been waiting
quite some time for this one sorry for I
just taking so long but in this video
we'll be going through everything to
give you a reference for when your
guests may be buying your next monitor
or something like that so the three main
screen technology is used for LCDs which
are by far the most common type of
display used for PC monitors are 10 IPs
and v-a I'm sure you've heard these
terms before when you're researching
monitors to purchase this is a key piece
of information on the spec sheet there
reveals a lot about how the monitor will
behave and perform I'm not going to
spend a lot of time going into
excruciating detail on the exact
differences in the technologies
themselves but I think a brief overview
is worth in the rest of this video I
will be more focused on the individual
characteristics of the tech and how it
performs but I guess I can't get to that
before I even mention what each term
stands for so TN is the oldest of the
LCD technologies and it stands for
twisted nematic this refers to the
twisted nematic effect which is an
effect that allows liquid crystal
molecules to be controlled with voltage
while the actual workings of a TN affect
LCD are a little more complicated
essentially the T in effect is used to
change the alignment of liquid crystals
when a voltage is applied when there is
no voltage so the crystal is off the
liquid crystal molecules are twisted 90
degrees and that allows light to pass
through then when a voltage is applied
these crystals are essentially untwisted
and in combination with polarization
layers block light from passing through
IPS stands for in plane switching and
like all LCDs it too uses voltage to
control the alignment of liquid crystals
however unlike with TN LCDs IPS LCD s
use a different crystal orientation one
where the crystals are parallel to the
glass substrates hence the term in plane
rather than twisting the crystals to
modify the amount of light LED through
IPS crystals
essentially rotated which has a range of
benefits there are many IPS variants on
the market with each of the three big
LCD manufacturers using a different term
to describe their IPs type of technology
LG simply calls their tech IPS which is
easy for everyone
Samsung uses the term POS or plane to
line switching while AU Optronics uses
the term a HBA or advanced hyper viewing
angle a hv8 shouldn't be confused with
regular VA displays it's an a bit of an
annoying and confusing name in my
opinion but a hva is an IPS light
technology each of LG's IPS Samsung's
POS and AUSA hva are slightly different
but the fundamentals are rooted in IPS
technology then we get to VA which
stands for vertical alignment as the
name suggests this technology uses
vertically aligned liquid crystals which
tilts when a voltage is applied to let
light pass through this is the key
difference between IPs and VA with VA
the crystals are perpendicular to the
substrates while with IPS they are
parallel and again there are several VA
variants including Samsung's SVA and AU
Optronics AM VA again don't confuse a
MVA with a H VA they are very different
in technology despite only a single
letter name difference so in summary TN
panels twist IPS panels use a parallel
alignment and rotate while VA panels use
a vertical alignment and tilt now let's
get into some of the performance
characteristics and explore how each of
the technologies differ and in general
which technology is better in any given
category by far the biggest difference
between the three technologies is in
viewing angles TN panels have the
weakest viewing angles with significant
shifts to colors and contrast in both
the horizontal and especially vertical
directions typically viewing angles are
rated as 170 / 160 but realistically
you'll get pretty bad shifts when
viewing anywhere except for dead-center
higher-end Tian's tend to be somewhat
better but overall this is a big
weakness for tiens VA and IPS panels are
both significantly better with IPS being
the best overall for viewing angles 178
/ 1 7 year viewing angle ratings are
realistic reflection of what you can
expect with an IPS you won't get much
shifting colors or contrast from an
angle V A's are good in this regard but
not as good as IPS mostly due to
contrast shifts at off-center angles
with V A's and especially T ends having
some color and contrast shifts when
viewing at angles than others well
sooner to color critical professional
work as IPS panels which is why you see
most pro grade monitors sticking to IPs
in terms of brightness there's no
inherent differences between the
technologies because the backlight which
determines brightness is separate to the
liquid crystal panel however there are
significant differences to contrast
ratios and again this is an area most
people look at when determining which
panel type they want both TN and IPS
panels tend to have a contrast ratio
around one thousand to one although in
my testing I have noticed some
differences TN panels tend to have the
lowest contrast ratios when calibrated
with an entry level panel sitting
between 700 and 900 to 1 and good panels
pushing up to that 1,000 to 1 mark
IPS has a large range I've seen some as
low as 700 to 1 like T ends however the
very best tend to push up higher than 10
with 1200 to 1 the upper range for
monitors and some laptop grade display
as reaching as high as 1500 to 1 neither
T and nor IPS get to the range of V a
though interval V a panel start with the
contrast ratio of 2000 to 1 from those
that I have tested with the best easily
exceeding 40 500 to 1 although 3,000 to
1 is a typical figure for most monitors
TVs also make extensive use of VA panels
and ver contrast ratios can be even
higher it's not unusual to see over 6
thousand to 1 so if you want deep blacks
and high contrast ratios you'll need to
go with something VA or IPS panels tend
to be a middle ground for contrast they
do suffer from a phenomenon called IPS
glow which is an apparent white glow
when viewing dark imagery at an angle
the best panels exhibit minimal glow but
it's still an issue across all displays
of this type color quality is another
difference many people cite between TN
displays and other displays in
particular and this can be split into
two categories
color depth or bit depth and color gamut
in both of these regards TN panels tend
to fall on the weaker end of the sky
many TN displays in particular
entry-level models are only natively six
bit and use frame rate control otherwise
called FRC or dithering to achieve
standard eight bit output six bigoted
panels are prone to color banding while
native 8-bit panels have smoother color
gradients and therefore better color
output that's not to say all TN panels
are six bit the very top intends and
native eight bit but it's safe to say
most teams will only be native six bit
even today if you are after a native 8
bit display you'll need to go with
either IPS or ba where many more panels
come native 8 bit while there are still
six bit entry-level IPS NVA panels
pretty much all mid-range to high-end
options are 8-bit these days and it's
for native true 10 bit typically you'll
need to look for an IPS panel which make
up the majority of native 10 bit panels
some VI panels can do it but they are
pretty rare most displays you actually
purchase that claimed to be 10 bit are
actually 8 bit plus FRC with only
high-end professional-grade monitors
offering a native 10 bit experience 4
color gamut again this is an area where
VA and IPS provide a superior experience
the best TN panels tend to be limited to
srgb or in the case of the worst
entry-level panels they don't even cover
the entirety of the srgb gama again this
isn't to say wide gamut tan panels don't
exist they are just quite rare so almost
all TN panels on the market you'll be
stuck with just srgb VI panels typically
start with full srgb coverages and
minimum and depending on the panel can
push higher bas that use a quantum dot
film typically from Samsung offer higher
gamut surround the 125 percent srgb or
90% DCI p3 mark most of the wide gamut v
air monitors i've tested for between 85
and 90% DCI p3 coverage which is a
decent result though the best can
approach 95% or higher with IPS panels
there is the largest variants
entry-level IPS display is tend to often
95% srgb coverage or less while the
majority stick to full srgb coverage
there with high-end displays usually
before professionals it's not unusual to
see full DCI p3 and Adobe RGB coverage
of all the wide gamut IPS displays I
have tested the lowest DCI p3 coverage
I've seen has been
93% with over 95% a typical figure this
makes IPS the best technology for wide
gamut work throughout most of this
discussion we've been talking about TN
as the worst of the three technologies
so far it has had the worst color
reproduction contrast ratios and viewing
angles of the three main options but it
does have one key advantage and that
comes in the form of speed TN panels are
the best for both refresh rates and
response times
currently TN panels are the only panel
type able to hit 240 hertz doing so at
1080p and also now 1440p VI panels top
out at 200 Hertz for ultra wide displays
however most 16:9 models are limited to
165 Hertz it's similar with IPS panels
which top out at 165 Hertz although a
240 hertz 1080p option is in the works
at LG while IPS panels are able to
refresh at 144 hertz and above the
number of panels which are high refresh
is pretty limited compared to both VA
and TN most IPS display is especially
high grade options for professionals as
well as entry-level office monitors are
either 60 or 75 Hertz meanwhile a
significantly large number of VA panels
across a wider range of sizes and
resolutions are high refresh while the
big selling point of TN is its super
high refresh capabilities the other
major consideration is response times
which governed the level of ghosting
smearing and I guess the overall clarity
of a panel early IPS and V err panels
were very slow however this has improved
a lot with modern panels so the
differences between the three
technologies aren't as pronounced as
they once were
with that said TN still holds a strong
advantage here compared to the other
types most TN panels have a radio
transition time of one millisecond or
even lower with some recent releases
actual greater grade averages i've
measured for TN panels tend to be in the
2 to 3 millisecond range when overdrive
is factored in which makes TN the clear
fastest technology IPS panels of the
next fastest though as tends to be the
case with IPS there is a wide variance
between the best and worst of this type
high-end IPS monitors typically those
with high refresh rates can have a
transition time as fast as 4
milliseconds from what
measured compared to the best TN panels
this makes IPS at best twice as slow
however entry-level IPS panels or those
without overdrive sit more in a 10
millisecond range while your mid-tier
options tend to occupy the five to seven
millisecond bracket VA panels are
consistently the slowest of the three
types the absolute fastest I've measured
has been between five and six
milliseconds though more typical numbers
are between eight and ten milliseconds
for gaming grade monitors via air powers
also tend to be less consistent with
their transition some individual
transitions can be fast while others
very slow
whereas IPS panels and TN panels tend to
hover more around their overall greater
great average while a lot of people are
unlikely to spot the difference between
an eighth millisecond VA panel and a
five millisecond IPS TN panels are at
least from my experiences noticeably
clearer in motion the slowness of VI
panels also limits their real-world
refresh rate a 144 Hertz panel that only
manages a 9 millisecond response time is
actually delivering an image most
equivalent to a 110 Hertz panel whereas
most 144 Hertz IPS panels can transition
faster than the 6.9 for millisecond
refresh window leading to a true 144
Hertz experience so that is something to
consider so that pretty much wraps up
the comparison as a quick summary for
you guys TN panels are the fastest and
have the highest refresh rates however
they have the worst viewing angles by
far as well as weak color performance
and typically the lowest contrast ratios
tiens are typically used for high-end
ultra files and gaming displays as well
as budget class displays from both
desktop monitors and laptops IPS is a
middle ground technology they typically
have the best color performance and
viewing angles mid-tier response times
and refresh rates along with mid-tier
black levels and contrast ratios due to
its top-end color output IPS panels are
the go-to choice for professionals but
you'll also find them in entry level
displays office grade monitors most
laptops and a small handful of gaming
monitors VA panels are the slowest of
the three but have the best contrast
ratio and black levels by far color
performance isn't quite at the level of
IPs but they still offer
sniffing t better experience than T n in
this regard with response times for the
best modern VA s approaching the level
of a typical IPs along with broad
support for high refresh rates VA panels
are commonly used for gaming motors
entry-level videos also tend to be
superior to both entry-level TN and IPS
panels though you won't find VA used in
laptops overall there's really no right
answer as to which monitor technology is
the best because all three have their
strengths and weaknesses which is why I
guess all three of them still coexist on
the market today however if you really
want my recommendation I tend to
gravitate towards VA panels for most
buyers especially gamers and those after
something entry-level creative
professionals should be looking
exclusively at IPS monitors for their
superior color performance while those
up to something dirt cheap or ultra high
refresh for competitive gaming should
opt for TN and that's pretty much it for
this one hopefully that has answered the
question I keep getting asked about TN
vs. IPS versus VA for modern monitors
and I guess this world should serve as a
good reference for future monitor
