unbox I know a lot of you guys out there
love your Corsair stuff whether it's
your keyboards and mice or your power
supplies and memory but today we've got
something a little bit different than
the company this is the Corsair one
their new small form-factor gaming PC
and to be honest this is probably the
best small form-factor gaming PC that I
reviewed so far it's a truly excellent
product and you'll get to see just how
good courses engineering is when we open
up this bad boy in just a little bit
anyway we'll start by talking about as
always the hardware inside the Corsair
1r there's a number of configuration
options available the base model comes
with an intel core i7 7700 processor
with a gtx 1070 GPU inside but my review
'not here
7700 k so they've given you the
overclocking ability in this particular
model and also GT x 1080 graphics in a
chassis that's just this large and for
those that want to spend a bit more
money and you can afford to splurge out
a bit there is a GT X 1080 TI model of
the course that one available through
courses website so of course it is
definitely not holding back when it
comes to the hardware inside this system
you'll also find 16 gigabytes of ddr4
memory in all Corsair 1 units and MSI Z
270 Mini ITX motherboard and 80 plus
gold certified sfx power supply and SSD
options from corsair ranging from 240 up
to 960 gigabytes Maariv unit here comes
to the Corsair force la 960 gig drive so
top-of-the-line in my particular
reviewnit that will only give the best
of hardware in box to check out of
course the Corsair one looks fantastic
on the outside this is one of the few
small form-factor gaming pcs I've seen
the truly looks excellent whether it's
sitting on your desk or in your home
theater setup this is mostly down to the
beautiful aluminium panels of their
views all around this device it's bead
blasted with a matte black finish it
looks fantastic it gives off a premium
look to this device and I really like
those sort of bins that you get along
the top
there's a top 140 mm fan that sort of
exhausts most of the air out out of the
top here and those fins just make it
seem like this device is powerful and
requires a lot of cooling when that's
not necessarily the case both the left
and right sides are perforated here for
the intake to the CPU and GPU coolers
and along the front you will see those
beautiful channels where the blue LED
light strip emanates through courses
they didn't give this an RGB LED strip
because they wanted to give off the
proper aesthetic for their small
form-factor PC the aqua blue color here
makes it seem cool and quiet and that is
certainly the case when you power on
this device for the first time Corsair
says this is a VR ready system which is
why you will find hdmi 2.0 and USB 3.0
type-a on the front of this device and
if you suite around to the back well you
get all the i/o from that MSI
motherboard so you'll get a further
three USB 3.1 gen2 on ports two USB 2.0
ports where you keyboard a mouse USB 3.1
gen2 type-c Gigabit Ethernet five 3.5 mm
audio jack sphere surround sound analog
audio plus optical s/pdif and we get two
antenna connectors for the AO 2.11 AC
Wi-Fi solution and of course triple
display setups are possible place to to
display point one point four connectors
and an hdmi 2.0 port which are all
connected internally to the graphics
card speaking of the internals it's
really worth opening up the course I
want to take a look at just how awesome
this device is engineered in the Corsair
one Pro models which come with the GTX
1080 or higher both the CPU and GPU are
liquid cooled with closed-loop solutions
here on the CPU side there's no
additional fan only the 140 millimeter
fan on the top of the unit is drawing
air through the system to cool that
radiator on the side panel and on the
GPU side if you get that GTX 2 native
model that's liquid cooled as well with
an additional blower fan that assists
with the cooling solution here if you're
up for the entry-level model with the
GTX 970 it is just air-cooled but it's
great to see that on the higher-end
models especially those who buy one with
the GTX 1080p I in it then you get the
added cooling benefit of the 240
millimeter slimline radiator here pass
the best aspect to the Corsair one is
new
great ability everything in this system
is an off-the-shelf component to the
motherboard CPU and RAM to the SFX power
supplied the SSD and even the graphics
card Corso tells me there's enough room
for an 11 inch triple slot graphics card
inside the one if you do up to still use
that 240 millimeter are close of liquid
core after you upgrade you'll be reduced
to just two slots here but the fact that
the graphics card is even upgradeable in
this system is far better than a lot of
other small form-factor gaming PC's that
use either sold it on GPUs or you know
your laptop style GPUs inside in this
system everything is user upgradeable
let's just say in the future you know
Intel releases a new CPU platform you
need to upgrade the motherboard you can
simply swap out the mini ITX board in
here for an entirely new platform the
i/o shield pops out on the back
everything is good to go and that's one
of the great things about the Corsair 1
because let's be honest you're going to
have to spend a bit more than usual to
get the one chassis you know there's
always that pre-built premium on the
price point but the fact that in the
future you can reuse this chassis
upgrade anything inside the device
really reduces the impact of that extra
premium that you'll have to pay as we're
looking at off-the-shelf components in
my review note again 2 X 1080 graphics
and a core i7 7700 K the corsair one
performs exactly as you expect for those
components in a gaming system check out
all of our previous coverage on the gtx
1080 the core i7 and 7700 k and all of
that because well the corsair one
performs exactly as you will see across
all the benchmarks we've done on
hardware unboxed in the past it's a
great gaming system with the gtx 1080 in
it for 1440p even 4k gaming depending on
the quality settings I was mostly gaming
on my pleb quality 1080p TV I've been
quite upgraded to 4k yet but
gaming at 1080p on a GTX 1080 is
fantastic you know you're pushing about
60fps in pretty much every situation and
that's exactly what you want to see from
the Corsair one more impressive than the
performance though is the cooling
solution this guy runs remarkably quiet
for the size of the unit at idle the
system is very very quiet if you place
it next to your monitor you will be able
to hear a bit of Rumble a bit of hum
from those closest liquid cores and sand
on the top but if you put this you know
a meat
or two away it's pretty much silent
during regular operation after firing up
a game it takes almost 15 minutes for
the close of liquid workers to heat up
and even then the system isn't that loud
during load again it's on your desk
you'll be able to hear it but if you're
playing some in-game audio and speakers
you'll pretty easily wash out the sounds
from this device and you know put it on
the floor a little bit away and again
the corsair one is pretty silent in that
regard as for cooling performance thanks
to those it's liquid cools in the
corsair one this system runs pretty darn
cool for such a small and compact system
during the lengthy session of watchdogs
to the cpu is hovering around the 68 to
72 degrees celsius mark and that's
impressive consuming there's no fan
directly attached to the radiator in
here but even more impressive the GPU
sitting at 54 degrees celsius no matter
what I did that's a very solid result
and gives you plenty of room for
overclocking which we'll touch on in
just a moment if you do fire up out of
60 for system stability test I managed
to push the CPU up to around the 83
degrees Celsius mark which reduces a
little bit the overclocking Headroom on
the 7700 K but nevertheless you know
that's a pretty decent result
considering those close of liquid cores
and only this single 140 millimeter fan
on the top of the unit as for
overclocking on the CPU side I was able
to push up the CPU to 4.9 gigahertz
pretty easily but the CPU did run pretty
hot at just over ninety degrees Celsius
I didn't really want to run over ninety
degrees C so I pulled the CPU clock
speed down to more like 4.8 gigahertz on
the 7700 K and then the CPU is sitting
more it's sort of your 86 to 87 degrees
Celsius I think that's a pretty good
result considering the cooling solution
inside as for the GPU you can do pretty
much whatever you like because there's
so much thermal Headroom in this system
I pushed plus 190 megahertz on the GTX
1080s core clock and around plus 170 on
the memory the GPU is then running
constantly at over 2,000 megahertz no
matter you know what sort of situation
we're throwing at it and that only added
one degree Celsius to the temperature of
the GPU so pull NTR overclocking
Headroom in this guy you can basically
push it up to the limits of the GTX 1080
and getting an extra 10 to 11 percent
more performance out of it is no slouch
and it's you know with that making the
system anyway
or hot or anything like that that's a
really solid result for this very
flexible and well suited to gaming a
small form-factor system so the coarser
one looks amazing on the outside it's
really well engineered on the inside
with a fantastic cooling solution great
performance and everything is used
upgradeable so the thing that you
probably asking yourself now is how much
does it cost to get my hands on my own
Corsair 1 unit well if you're after the
entry-level model with its gtx 1070 GPU
and core i7 7700 cpu it will set you
back around 1,800 US dollars over in
australia like me around $2,600 redos I
did quickly whip up a system on you a
just to see what it would cost to build
you know your own system with similar
hardware and it came to around 1400 US
dollars so a $400 price premium for the
Corsair 1 again it will be a bit steep
to pay for those two the more keen on
building their own system but you have
to understand there's a lot of people
out there who can't be bothered with
that they just want a nice looking
pre-built system and the Corsair 1 you
know it's user upgradeable you get that
fantastic engineering and cooling
solution on the inside there's some
people you know it could be worth paying
that price premium to get the Corsair
one unit at this price point there's a
similar price premium on the reviewnit
that I received to review so this
particular model here costs $2,300 with
the GTX 1080 and one terabyte each hard
drive on the inside or just over $3,000
deuce I think it's three thousand one
hundred and fifty dollars in Australia
for this model again $400 price premium
over an equivalent model with the same
hardware so again you know not too bad
for considering the hardware and the
excellent chassis that you're getting
here I really love the course I wants
one of my favorite small form-factor
gaming PC's and but one of course is
first attempts of making a system like
this it's a really solid offering anyway
that's it for this review of the Corsair
one that's listed by the system in the
description below if you're interested
don't forget to check out the written
review on tech spot comm and we will
catch you in the next one
