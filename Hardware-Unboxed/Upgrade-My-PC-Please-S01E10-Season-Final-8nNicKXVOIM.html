upgrade my PC please we made it on last
week's episode we had five randomly
selected computers all the need of
various upgrades
I knew the viewers voted Joshua's Core 2
quad rig the most worthy of receiving
the proposed upgrades so coming his way
is a Verizon 7 1,700 processor and a
seuss ROG Strix be 350 motherboard and
eight gigabytes of ddr4 memory and as
always for you viewers don't forget to
vote and comment each week because that
will place you on the running to win
some cool prizes and again those are
global giveaways for example last week's
when I was from India and they took home
a very cool AOC gaming monitor this
week's went up will be announced at the
end of the video so stick around for
that but before then we have 5 around
and PCs to check out and they will be
the last 5 pcs of season 1 first up we
have a converted pre-built from Nicholas
originally this was a HP Envy system but
over time he's upgraded everything
except for that terrible Oh am case and
therefore he says the next thing that he
wants to tackle is the case apparently
the airflow in that HP Envy case is very
poor right now Nicholas is playing games
such as battlegrounds GTA 5 and
Borderlands but he would also like to
start playing new a triple-a title such
as destiny true for example he also
notes that ideally he would like any of
the upgrades to stick with his current
black silver and red theme but he
acknowledges that beggars can't
necessarily be choosers well mate I do
appreciate your passion I like your
attention to detail so I'll do my best
to stay on theme looking over the system
specs this is a tricky one to say the
least because there are quite a few
components here that do need upgrading
in fact pretty much everything with the
exception of the power supply and of
course the monitor I would also like to
squeeze an SSD into the budget and of
course replace that sad excuse for a
computer case well not exactly the bee's
knees a quad-core Haswell CPU is still
pretty sprightly so let's stick with the
core i5 44-34 now a big contributing
factor to that decision of course is the
16 gigabytes of ddr3 memory and it would
be a real
shame to ditch that so this is how I
propose we go about things I think it's
safe to say the GeForce GTX 760 is the
weakest link by far in this system and
replacing that with a newer graphics
card is really a must so the GeForce GTX
1060 that's gonna really take the gaming
experience to the next level then to
load up all of Nicholas's games in
record time we have the crucial MX 300
525 gigabyte model no less replacing the
HP case is the exceptionally good value
Coolermaster masterbox light 3.1 and
because we can let's ditch that ugly
stock looking cooler with the deep cool
game ax 400 a compact style cooler that
will fit nicely inside the master box
and it will also have a little bit of
room to spare should Nikolas win he will
have a very nice setup that'll get him
bye for now and then the future when he
upgrades the platform who are we ready
to take full advantage popping over to
Canada we have rides I'm gonna sounding
nuclear doom
it's an AMD FX based rig so I get it
come right away you can tell Ryan he
kind of loves his AMD hardware that
Thermaltake a v3 AMD edition case really
is something else it's a shame the core
i5 8400 isn't in stock that in the
geforce gtx 1060 would be perfect for
this build okay enough messing around
business time now this pc was built
about a year ago which may surprise a
few of you and it was built after a
nine-year stint with an old phenom ii
system now Wright admits that he wasn't
aware that rise and was about to be
released at the time of building this
system apparently you can't get internet
under a rock seriously though m8 by late
2015 the word Zen was added at least
once every 60 seconds by tech
enthusiasts around the world
anyway the PC is used for gaming and
streaming right now Ryan's playing
Wolfenstein new order doom 4 and World
of Warcraft now we could see there all
day and discuss why Ryan bought an FX
83-70 in 2016 but let's just give him a
pass on that one
he came here for some upgrade help so
let's try and give him some
first pro tip though run an FX series
CPU in dual channel memory mode single
channel stars and already starve CPU but
again I guess that's not why you came
here not for that advice anyway so ok
look just get to the upgrade stuff the
Radeon rx 480 is obviously still very
capable that FX CPU though well let's
just quietly replace that with a horizon
5 1600 at this point Ryan's probably
heard enough and he's already polishing
that AMD logo on the front of his case
the CPU will find itself right at home
on gigabytes a be 350 gaming motherboard
with 8 gigabytes of ddr4 memory now if
Ryan finds it necessary he can add an
additional 8 gigabytes of memory in the
future but other than that he should be
pretty right for some time to come if
he's lucky enough to win now this next
PC entered by Charles is actually his
fiancee's PC she uses it for gaming
streaming and creating more videos the
game of choice right now is overwatch
that sounds like Charles and his fiance
play a lot of overwatch and I can
certainly understand that it's a very
addictive game if only I had time to
play anyway the PC has been scavenged
together using whatever spare parts they
could get their hands on not that long
ago this PC was lagging even more than
it does now with an FX 4130 processor
but that was recently upgrade to the FX
83 20 when Charles upgraded his own rig
to horizon so the aim here is to achieve
smoother gameplay particularly when
streaming and because she does do quite
a bit of video editing on the side a
more powerful CPU for encoding is a must
another issue with the current system is
the power supply it's a custom Alienware
unit which doesn't meet the standard ATX
specification therefore doesn't fit
correctly in the deep cool tesseract
case so ideally they'd like to change it
the system also lacks an SSD and that's
something I personally feel is a must
for every system so we do have quite a
few things that we need to try and
address here that being the case I'll
have to be a little bit more crave with
our budget than usual the r5 1600 would
be my typical go-to choice for such a
system gaming and streaming but it's not
really gonna fit in our $500 u.s. budget
with all the other things that I want to
get so what
to compromise there and go for the
horizon five 1400 instead and we'll slip
again onto the gigabyte a be 350 gaming
motherboard with a gigabytes of ddr4
memory then to speed up load times and
the overall snappiness of the system
let's migrate the OS to the crucial bx
300 120 gigabyte SSD and make it a lot
less hacked together we'll go with the
Thermaltake smart 600 watt power supply
to replace that oversized Alienware
thing that's just sitting in the bottom
of the case right now
should they be lucky enough to win in
the future when Charles and his fiance
have a little bit more money to play
with they could upgrade the graphics
card maybe add a little more memory and
perhaps even go crazy with the CPU and
rise and Plus arrives next year now
we're back over to the US for a little
veggie my hmm was unexpected didn't
expect to see veggie Mart
next to a computer in one of these but
anyway Australian spreads aside we have
a rather smart looking PC built by JC
here and it was built back in 2014 for
less than $500 u.s. which happens to be
our budget today JC admits though that
his priorities were a little off on this
one as he spent most of the money on the
case but after seeing the end case m1
version four he just had to have it so
it's fair to say any upgrade plans that
we make now will be based around this
case although the system is pretty basic
with an AMD a10 7850 ka pu and the
Radeon HD 6870 graphics card JC's not
really asking that much of it at the
moment is he really only plays a super
smash brothers melee on net play via the
dolphin emulator
that said he is planning on upgrading
for next year to play a monster hunter
world which will no doubt be a bit too
much for the APU and 6000 series GPU so
for this upgrade I'm again going to go
with the rising 5 1400 because we also
need to replace the graphics card and
that will only fit in our budget the
real tough choice here though for me was
what motherboard we go with because we
are limited to an a m4 mini ITX
motherboard they're really apt that many
of those around and pretty much all of
them are priced over $100 us which kind
of
blows out our budget a bit so yeah I
there is a bio starboard for $85 us
which looks to be an exceptionally good
value by but I've never really
recommended a bio start product before
and I was a bit hesitant to touch this
one after a bit of research it seems to
have received pretty solid reviews from
professional reviewers and the user
feedbacks also been very positive since
it will work within our budget and my
hands are pretty much tied anyway
because we can't afford anything else
I'm gonna bite the bullet I recommend if
the bio star X 370gt n it's pretty much
our only choice so let's go with it and
yeah I've got no reason to doubt it at
this point the only problem with a mini
ITX board and we'll face this problem
with any mini ITX board is that if JC
wants to expand the memory down or in
the future he will have to dump the 8
gigabyte chip that we've purchased with
this upgrade package and then buy a pair
of 8 gigabyte sticks for a 16 gigabyte
capacity but that is the limitation of
the Mini ITX form factor as I said
there's no getting around that
then handling the 3d rendering work
which I suppose the gaming will be the
chief force GT x 1050 Ti which should be
a nice upgrade from the odd Radeon HD
6850 should JC win he'll be receiving a
huge upgrade from what he currently has
and should be well primed to take on
monster hunter world next year last stop
we have Andrews ROG beast and right away
and has to be said that this system is
already quite good but we don't
discriminate against those who have made
wise purchases in the past or a
passionate about the components they use
all systems are welcome as I've said of
photos our key guys 100% key to getting
pics so be aware of that for season 2
I'll talk about this a bit more in a
video soon anyway
focusing on Andrews rig it is an Ivy
Bridge based Core i5 35 7nk and when I
overclock the CPU still offers a decent
experience of spite being limited to
just 4 cores and 4 threads still
ditching it for something like the
horizon 5 1400 wouldn't really be that
much of an upgrade and it certainly
wouldn't justify getting rid of 16
gigabytes worth of ddr3 memory
not with today's prices anyway this su
Strix geforce gtx 1066 gigabyte is also
a very good graphics card but next year
andrew wants to start gaming at 1440p so
he is eyeing off a GPU upgrade he also
wants to get rid of that old silverstone
power supply if possible now if you guys
haven't guessed andrew is a massive ROG
Strix fan and he really wants to stick
with a soos hardware front upgrades so
we're pretty limited here but he really
wants it so I'm gonna suggest the Asuza
ROG Strix gtx 1070 gaming 8g and well
that will eat up pretty much our entire
budget it really isn't even enough room
left over to upgrade that power supply
having said that though the gtx 1070 and
core i5 combo that won't come anywhere
near 400 watts so the power supply
shouldn't be an issue
just finally before wrapping this up if
this one are in the system I'd really be
keen to get rid of the core i5 3570 can
replace that with a secondhand core i7
3770k that would pretty much be the best
option here providing you can get one
for the right price all right guys
