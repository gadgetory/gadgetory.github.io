the first of what will be several CES
related videos over the coming weeks we
aren't actually at CES ourselves as you
well I guess might be able to tell but
throughout the week we'll be giving you
guys some opinions and updates on what's
been happening at the show and that
starts today with AMD's first
announcement second-generation rise in
mobile so the first important point to
note about second-generation rise in
mobile is these are not 7 nanometre
parts aMDA is set to talk more about 7
nanometers at their keynote for other
product lines but these new mobile
processors are built on 12 nanometers
using the existing Zen plus architecture
they also carry rise in mobile 3000
series branding as expected this may be
a little confusing considering
third-generation rise in desktop parts
are expected to form the rest of the
rise in 3000 series and should be built
using 7 nanometers but it does fit in
with AMD's existing product lines the
rise of mobile 2000 series for example
debuted ahead of second-generation Rison
but still used the original Zen
architecture on for 10 nanometers rise
from above 3000 is a natural successor
bumping their line up to 12 nanometers
and then Plus around 15 months after
first gen rise in mobile you think that
if an B is launching 12 nanometer rise
in mobile paths now that mobile ap is
based on Zen too is still some time away
which again fits with ambe's recent
launch cycles the C mobile parts
released well after their desktop
counterparts in any case let's talk
about the second gen rise in mobile
lineup because these are Zen plus CPUs
on 12 nanometers this isn't a major
upgrade over the first generation for
the most part we're looking at 100
megahertz increases to the base clock
and between 100 and 200 megahertz
increases to the boost clock for the CPU
cores facilitated by the minor bump from
40 nanometers to 12 nanometers
there are 415 what you serious cues in
the lineup at the top end we have the
risin 730 700 you as a fork or a thread
part
clocked up to 4 gigahertz that's really
the biggest upgrade to clock speeds here
previously the 2700 you topped out at
3.8 gigahertz but its successor can hit
4.0 gigahertz
we're also seeing an extra hundred
megahertz added to the clock speed of
the Vega 10 GPU now it's 1,400 megahertz
up from thirteen hundred megahertz
across ten compute units while cache is
listed here as six megabytes of l2 and
l3 it seems the split of two megabytes
l2 and four megabytes l3 remains the
same as first generation then we have
the risin 5 3500 you again for cause
with SMT slightly lower clock speeds on
the CPU compared to the 3700 you and it
has Vega
8 graphics at twelve hundred megahertz
also one hundred megahertz higher than
its predecessor the rise in three 3300
you comes in with a lower boost clock on
the CPU and the GPU is cut down to Vegas
6 with six compute units again this is
all very similar to the first gen lineup
but with slightly higher clock speeds
Verizon 3 3200 u comes in as a two core
four thread part with Vega three
graphics again with clock speed
improvements over the 2200 you there are
some new parts in the lineup though in
particular we have two 35 watt H series
CPUs designed for gaming notebooks this
is an area ambi says they want to get
into more and are going to be pursuing
more opportunities with across 2019
first generation mobile did eventually
get 35 watt H series cues but they
weren't really seen in any laptops it
sounds like that will change with 2nd
gen looking at ambe's table there is no
difference to the specifications between
the 35 watt and 15 watt parts except the
TDP so the risin 737 58 for example has
the same core configuration clock speeds
and GPU as the risin 7 3700 you however
with that higher 35 watt TDP the 3758
will be able to sustain much higher CPU
and GPU clocks for a longer time it is a
little unusual that base clocks have
dropped from the mid 3.0 gigahertz range
down to 2.3 gigahertz and 2.1 gigahertz
but I suspect the high TDP will still
allow sustain clocks above the 3.3 and
3.2 gigahertz base clocks of the
previous generation for CPU workloads
with second gen rising mobile
Ami's H throughs processes still have
the challenge of going up against
Intel's 45 watt 8 Series offerings which
are currently 6 called 12 thread parts
with similar clock speeds the quad-core
risin 737 58 will end up more closely
matched to something like Intel's Core
i5 83
300h which is commonly found in more
budget focused gaming systems the asou
system Amy showed off that uses the
arisin 737 50 h and Rison 535 50 h seems
to be one of these budget focus machines
as it packs a Radeon rx by 60 X GPU and
it's fairly typical entry level gaming
dimensions I think we'll see the h2 is
used in similar designs across 2019 AMD
has also introduced an entry-level
Athlon apu into their rise in mobile
lineup for the first time it's the
Athlon 300 you this is a very similar
apu to the Rison 330 200 you in that it
has two cores four threads and three
Vega compute units but everything is
clocked lower and it's still built using
four ten nanometers Amy says this chip
is designed for the entry level windows
and Chromebook market where Rison 3
wasn't really competing as well so
expect dirt cheap prices for that APU
that's basically the 2nd gen rise in
mobile lineup nothing spectacular it's
just a small clock speed increase that
will carry ambi through to seven
nanometer parts in probably 12 months or
so this release is very similar to
Intel's whiskey Lake u series and that
were only getting small increases over
the last generation and indeed lots of
Amy's materials with this launch were
focused on comparing 2nd gen Rison to
much older laptops which is a typical
upgrade path for buyers they did give a
few vague performance metrics for some
rising mobile 3000 series parts you can
see here a few comparisons between the
rise and 5 3500 you and the core i5 8250
you then in the next slide we have some
gaming data for the risin 7 3,700 years
integrated graphics up against Intel's
Core i7 85 65 u which is their latest 15
what whiskey like CPU as expected
you know both slides ambhi's product
looks pretty good perhaps the bigger
announcement out of today is that proper
rising mobile drivers will be available
starting q1 2019 for both first and
second generation rise in mobile ap use
AMD specifically said in their
presentation that when a new graphics
driver comes out for discrete Radeon
GPUs that driver will also support all
rising mobile products past and present
users will be able to download and
install this generic driver on any
system that uses those products this is
something we
yield would happen a couple of months
ago now and as expected it's been
announced alongside new rise in mobile
products md didn't specifically say if
these drivers would be available through
am be calm but you think that would be
the case especially as they are claiming
to deliver de 0 optimizations for games
and so on this is a really big deal
because the key issue with rise in
mobile products in the past has been
driver support the drivers OMS was
shipping and using what outdated and
buggy often uses would hack desktop or
AP drivers to work on their rise and
mobile laptops and between into much
better performance and stability that
shouldn't be a problem going forward
because AMD has listened to the
community and finally gotten their act
together on this and we'll be providing
their own generic drivers for all rising
mobile products and that's great news a
few loose ends to finish this one out
ambi is expecting 33% more design wins
for rising mobile in 2019 so that's a
modest improvement considering there are
only a few laptops on the market to use
ambe's mobile processes at the moment
still progress is progress at least ambi
actually has something competitive to
attract OMS MD also announced the a 692
20 C &amp;amp; a 4 90 120 C as processes
designed specifically for Chromebooks
these processes compete with Intel's
low-end atom trips like this seller on n
4200 these are based on AMD's older apu
designs on 28 nanometers so nothing
amazing but they do pack two cores and
two threads at decent enough clock
speeds in a six watt power end look
these will be seen in Chromebooks from
HP and Acer to begin with that's it for
today's announcements of course we are
expecting more stuff to be unveiled at
AMD's keynote address at CES in a few
days we're not expecting ambi to
announce
rise in 3000 series CPUs or any Navi
GPUs at the show but we do expect some
road map updates and teasers for both we
are expecting however plenty of
discussion around 7 nanometers as well
as amilies data center and mobile
products there's also a chance AMD will
announce a consumer 7 nanometre vega 2
GPU so we'll have to wait and see what's
in store as always you can subscribe to
Hardware box for more updates throughout
CES along with our thoughts on the
biggest announcements you can support us

discord chat and monthly live streams
and I'll catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
