going to address a question that is
often asked by you guys the viewers
which cpu should I buy for gaming Rison
five-o horizon 7 around this time last
year we set up to address that very
question with the first generation of
horizon CPUs by comparing the rise in
seven 1700 risin 5 1600 and we even
threw in the quad-core risin 5 1400 for
good measure the 1700 is of course an 8
core 16 thread CPU while the 1600 is a 6
cord 12 thread sea view and the 1400 a 4
core 8 thread CPU for that test we
benchmarked half a dozen modern titles
and found that overall there was very
little difference in the fights between
these six and eight core models
virtually no difference at all for most
titles in fact games such as total war
Warhammer - using the gtx 980ti with the
ultra quality setting saw no real
difference at 1080p and the same was
also true for hitman Deus Ex mankind
divided and even battlefield 1 in fact
even the margins and ashes of the
singularity were very minimal ultimately
what this meant was the risin 5 1600
ended up being a much more
cost-effective option and once
overclocked at cost gamers just $3.00
per frame in our tests while the 1700
was almost 40% more expensive per frame
now we have the newer second generation
riser models featuring the 6 core 2600
series and the 8 core 2700 series the 6
core models cost around 30% less so once
again many are asking us if they should
even bother with the 2700 or 2700 X 4
gaming rather than compare these 6 and 8
core processors and a ship loaded games
we're going to just get straight to the
point on this one as was the case a year
ago there really are still no games I
take full advantage of an 8 core
processor and in fact after the
singularity is still one of the best
examples we have even so using the
highest quality settings which still
allow the GTX 1080i to render well over
60 FPS 1440p we see absolutely no
difference in performance and this is
also true even at 1080p removing the GPU
bottleneck at 720p reveals the 8 core
model to be a superior performer but
in this title a tile that I'd say is
very cool heavy by today's standards
under almost all real-world conditions
that difference won't be realized
still if more games are like ashes of
the singularity I'm picking between
these two CPUs for gaming would be a
little more difficult however as it
currently stands most games look like
this and what we see here when testing
with deus ex mankind divided is nothing
no difference at all between these two
CPUs even at 720p this could also be
seen when testing with project curves -
and a number of other mostly GPU bound
games some games will slightly favor the
higher core cap processor we're not GPU
limited such as Just Cause 3 prey player
on owns battlegrounds and Ghost Recon
wildlands but the margins are very small
and again under most conditions won't be
realized recently we also conducted some
coarse scaling benchmarks when comparing
the 2700 x and 8700 k here are the
second-generation rise and results and
as you can quite clearly see playing
battle for the one with the gtx to a CI
1080p using the ultra quality settings
this sees very little difference between
the 6 and 8 core Eisen CPUs that said we
do see a reasonably large drop off with
just four cores active depending on the
conditions it is possible to achieve
slightly better performance with the 8
core model in games such as battlefield
1 but we're starting talking a 5%
difference when using medium quality
settings that being the case it's quite
clear nothing has changed in the past
year and e6 core 12 thread arisin 5
processes are still the sweet spot for
gamers offering the perfect balance of
price and performance you really only
need to look at the rise and 7 series if
you plan on running core heavy
applications doing things such as
encoding and rendering for example
purely for gaming the Rison 7 processes
are still overkill and while it is nice
to have that extra Headroom
truth be told you'll likely upgrade to a
newer more efficient CPU before taking
advantage of the Headroom offered by
those extra cores so if you're a gamer
trying to work out whether or not to
spend that extra hundred dollars on a
rise and 7 processor I recommend you
don't instead invest that money in some
quality ddr4 memory or a faster graphics
card and that is going to do it for the
benchmarks what they don't have to be
benchmarked marathons thanks for
watching I'm yo Steve see
