unboxed outside of our unboxing box of
series we haven't been doing as many
videos focused on peripherals mostly
because you guys out there that watch
these videos as well as a certain
channel are more interested in
benchmarking and so forth but whenever
we get the chance to look at unreleased
and unannounced hardware from Corsair of
course we're going to say yes anyway the
unannounced product i've been looking at
for the past couple of weeks is the
corsair void pro headset which is their
brand-new high-end gaming headset and
the good news for you guys out there is
that now that this video is live the
product has of course been and now so
you can now actually go out and buy one
but before you do here is pretty much
what i think of the new headset from
corset so the Void pro is basically the
new version of the void headset that's
been available for a little while now
for people wanting to buy a corsair
headset moving forward the void will be
discontinued and the void pro here will
take its place
however i was a little confused when
browsing through the specifications of
both products and I saw that the void
Pro is basically identical to the void
in most ways same design same support
for Dolby 7.1 surround sound and
basically the same specifications for
both the 50 millimeter drivers and the
noise cancelling microphone the void Pro
is even available in the same
configurations Wireless with RGB writing
which is the one I received to review as
well as a USB wide version with RGB and
a 3.5 ml wide version without RGB even
though the void and void Pro very
similar that doesn't mean there is cause
for concern here after all the void Pro
is the same price as last time 99 US
dollars for the wireless model and 79
dollars for the wide variant in
Australia expect to see some pretty
serious tax as the variants are 219 and
160 of the dollars respectively so if
you did want to buy a void you can now
buy the updated void Pro at no extra
cost at least after remaining stock
avoid disappears in the market as it's
currently near discounted price
second thing is that coarser claims
there are actually some changes to the
void probe even though the design and
specifications aren't significantly
different course there are claiming the
headset is more comfortable thanks to a
different type of foam use in the ear
cups producers that are sounds from
rebuilt and retune drivers and contains
a much improved microphone wireless
performance is also supposedly better
though both range and battery life stays
the same at least in their
specifications I haven't used the void
so I'm not going to spend any time
comparing the two headsets directly
instead here are my thoughts from using
the void Pro and compared to some other
popular headsets on the market that I've
tried so there's no doubting the void
Pro is a very comfortable headset
there's ample padding on the top and the
ear cups and I'm sure that the new foam
around the ears has only improved things
compared to last generation gaming with
this headset for hours with an absolute
breeze and the fact that my unit was
Wireless of course even better
unfortunately void Pro isn't a great fit
for my head the headset moves around a
lot when I move my head from side to
side or up and down and at times this is
pretty annoying swing my head back to
have a drink of water and the headset
nearly falls off my head
it seems that to achieve such great
comfort the headset doesn't clamp down
on my head as much as other headphones
of course they told me this wasn't an
issue for them so you know maybe it's
just my head shape but you'll have to
figure that out when you get one
yourself sound quality is very good I
tend to find it a little hard to
distinguish between most headsets around
this price but the void Pro doesn't fall
behind the pack delivering clear
mid-tones and a decent bass punch it
also a sword or round or two with good
audio for music and games I also think
the void Pro managed to keep its cool
when pushing the volume up distortions
can be a painful noise at high volumes
but I didn't find that as much of an
issue with this particular headset what
I will say though is not to bother with
the Dolby 7.1 surround mode it's not
particularly good often delivering worse
audio in games than just stand stereo I
think Razer perhaps has the best
implementation of virtuals from out at
the moment with most others not really
competing too strongly aside from that
there's the usual array of tricks here
there's a microphone mute button a
volume toggle that works well a boom
microphone that automatically disables
when you raise it and charging via
microUSB
speaking of battery life I tended to get
around
six to eight hours with RGB writing
enabled and closer to 14 hours with it
disabled and yes there is RGB lighting
here which I don't think is particularly
useful on a headset reckon you may as
well disable it to get roughly double
the battery life interested in the
microphone quality here's a quick sample
that I recorded earlier so this is just
a quick test of the Corsair voice pros
microphone by now you probably have a
pretty good idea of how this microphone
is going to work out for gaming because
you know it's pretty important to have a
headset that works for when you're
playing competitive games and that sort
of thing quite like the boom design
seems pretty nice but yeah I guess
that's that's our little test so I think
if the void probe fits your head well
enough it's a decent purchase for
seventy nine or ninety nine dollars
depending on whether you want wireless
connectivity it's much cheaper than the
HyperX cloud revolver which I've
recommended in the past and around the
same price as the Razer Kraken and
Logitech Steve 533 only small updates
relative to the void but it's the same
price so no big deal really I also want
to take a brief moment here at the end
to talk about the Corsair k68 which I've
been testing out for the past month or
so
the k68 is course there's mechanical
keyboard built specifically for
durability with an IP 32 rating
protecting it against light spills the
idea is here is that you can gain way
accidentally spill your drink on the
keyboard and it won't do any damage
whatsoever anyway I've been stress
testing this keyboard by you know giving
it quite a run down with some sticky
soft drinks and tomato sauce and food
and it does still continue to work
unless you go way over what I test the
best part is I have watch the keyboard
under attack to clean it off and a
couple of times it did work so yeah if
you tend to school food and drink on
your keyboard or just like the ability
to wash your keyboard I would recommend
the courses 68 just don't go overboard
with your soft drink or tomato sauce
because it might come out the other end
and not work oh and it does have Cherry
MX switches which is still the best
anyway that's a little look at some
course again of course you can check out
links to buy these products and Amazon
in the description below also let us
know if you want to see more peripheral
reviews on
channel we've been putting most of our
peripheral stuck into unboxing boxes and
I reckon if there's enough demand we
might consider what can peripherals more
on the channel in a review format but
that's it for this one and I'll catch
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
