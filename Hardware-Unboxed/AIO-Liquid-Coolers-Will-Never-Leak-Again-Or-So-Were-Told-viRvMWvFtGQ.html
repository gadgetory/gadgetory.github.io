sponsoring our trip to Computex 2019
please check out their range of intel
base motherboards via the link in the
video description also thank you to
Corsair for their support please check
all their exciting products out via the
link in the video description welcome
back to harbor unbox today we at the
deep cool booth and I was really hoping
that we could find a frozen 2 or some
sort of frozen version that would work
with the Xen two processors but
unfortunately not that they do have a
big air cooler it's just not it's not a
fries and branded cooler so I know you
guys will be disappointed because surely
everyone wanted to see the fries and
make a comeback anyway what we do have
is a really really cool demonstration of
their anti leaked technology you guys
might have seen we've run a few deep
cool ads for they're all in one liquid
coolers that do have their new anti
leaked technology and I was really
interested to see how much difference
that made or some sort of demonstration
and they do have a demonstration here
showing that pressure difference with
and without that technology installed
and it's really quite interesting it
makes a massive difference for between
about 50 to 70 degrees of course if you
go above that it gets out of control but
we'll get some b-roll that will show you
guys some figures of the demonstration
they're showing very interesting stuff
they also have some you all in one
liquid coolers so we'll check those out
as well and a couple of new cases so
let's go do that
okay so firstly I have to talk about
this really impressive demonstration the
deep cool setup to show off how their
new anti leak technology works before we
get to the demonstration I'll just say
that over the years I have had quite a
few all-in-one liquid coolers fail and
many that fail ended up leaking at some
point and this is an issue that's
plagued almost all brands that I've used
aware of this issue deep cool has spent
the last three years developing their
anti leak technology and while it
appears very effective it's also quite a
simple design or at least that's how it
appears to me anyway what deep cool is
done here is stick a small blood alike
tube in the radiator so as the liquid
and the gases within the loop expand due
to rising temperatures the bladder is
squeezed tight and the air within is
pushed out then as temperatures drop the
pressure on the bladder is reduced and
it expands once again to its normal size
and it will also draw in from the
outside as it returns to its original
size
without this bladder thing that I'm
calling it the pressure inside the loop
builds up to much higher levels and this
will stress the unit eventually the
weakest link in the design will fail and
typically this is some kind of rubber
hosing or seal and the chances of
failure dramatically increase over time
as the coolant reacts with the metals
and this sort of introduces contaminants
into the loop which further increases
internal pressure so to demonstrate the
effectiveness of this design deep cool
put together what's a really cool
demonstration using their Castle model
all in one liquid cooler and they've
done this with and without the anti leak
technology and they've quite clearly
labeled which ones which and then
they've done so using their 240 and 360
millimetre models it was difficult to
film this entire test as it does take
quite a few minutes as you would imagine
we have to heat everything up and then
you can turn the fans off and see how
the pressure is affected by all that
sort of stuff so we didn't film all of
that there were quite a few people and
that makes it difficult but anyway when
watching the demonstration we saw that
the pressure difference it was around 40
percent higher for the model that lacked
the anti leak technology that said we
were dealing with very high block
temperatures of around 80 degrees
but even went down around 50 degrees the
radiator sporting the anti leak
technology was reporting considerably
lower pressure within the loop it is a
really interesting demonstration and the
concept certainly makes sense to us
but of course this is one of those
things that well I suppose time will
tell just how useful this technology is
and well how effective it is but it's
still great to see that deep cool have
developed this technology has said it
seems to work very well and it's great
that it's now being offered across their
entire line of all-in-one liquid coolers
speaking of all-in-one liquid coolers
deep cool also had their newcastle 240 x
and 360 x models on display this seems
to be a more serious offering probably
targeting overclockers and it was
suggested to offer the very best cooling
performance of any AIO on the market
right now deep cool has upgraded the
pump with a more powerful motor and a
pressure charging impeller they've added
25% more fins to the cold plate for a
more efficient heat transfer and they've
dumped the RGB fans in favour of three
specially tuned TF 120 s fans that a
custom match to the radiator then for a
little bit of well bling flashiness
whatever you
call it they have modified the block
housing to include customizable logos
along with an external ring around the
well sort of the rim of the cooler
you'll see what I mean in the the b-roll
the base diameter of the block housing
has also been reduced to improve
compatibility with components around the
socket so we didn't see any problems
with the previous model but apparently
on certain boards certain hardware
configurations this does improve
compatibility overall I like the
upgrades that deep calls made here with
the Castle ax range and for those
interested they are now on sale the 240
X has an MSRP of 120 dollars u.s. while
the 360 X will set you back a hundred
and sixty dollars u.s. moving on deep
cool also had their new assassin 3 air
cooler on display and this big boy is
designed to take on knock to us NHD 15
and price-wise it is quite similar I
think the MSRP was about $100 u.s. this
beast weighs roughly one and a half
kilos so yeah as I said it's big boy
does pack a pair of 140 millimeter fans
and is rated for up to 128 watts of heat
dissipation there's seven u-shaped heat
pipes in total and I've got to say it
looks like I'll have no trouble taking
on the D 15 so perhaps that's a
comparison we can make in the
not-too-distant future
other than that deep cool had a few
cases on display but most of them had
already been shown off at the CES
tradeshow earlier in the year so that
concludes our look at deep cools
products they have on display here for
me it was that pressure test that was
really interesting so I'm interested in
what you guys think of that and I wonder
how hard it would be for Tim and I to
set up something like that so we could
test the pressure of a whole different
heap of all in one liquid coolers so
yeah that's certainly something I'd be
interested in doing I'm pretty sure that
something you guys would be interested
in seeing but ultimately I think we
probably have to wait I don't know 6 12
18 months to put you guys have been
using these anti leaked all-in-one
liquid coolers and see if they actually
don't leak as have't eyes obviously it's
pretty hard to know right now but it's a
promising technology and it seems to
work really well
definitely reduces the pressure inside
the loop so very cool stuff anyway I
think that's going to wrap it up for
here Tim hasn't tried trolling me on
this one he's done a great job behind
the camera
that's always much appreciated thanks
Tim and thank you guys for watching as
always and I'll catch you in the next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
