themselves the king of the customizable
game your Mouse market and they're
looking to do so with two key products
the nest and the key row both are very
customizable in their own ways with the
Kuro taking it to the next level by
being a completely ambidextrous piece of
equipment shout out to the left is not
only that rocket is even supplying 3d
printing customization options with
templates on their website in this video
I'm going to be taking a closer look to
the Kuro specifically rocket of
recommending this mouse for both fps and
mobile gamers and thanks for compact and
fairly regular shape it should be able
to suit both in fact a first look the
Kuro appears to be a pretty simple Mouse
however it does have a trick up its
sleeve let's take a look at the basics
first however up top we've got a nice
soft to touch black powder finish and
blaze them with the rocket Kiro RGB
backlit logo at the back of the mouse
rocket calls the finish on the side
panels they're no sweat finish and it
does feel nice and provide good grip
underneath we've got two large slit maps
to provide excellent glide on your
mousepad on the standard side panels
you'll find the classic back and forward
side buttons and either side can be
replaced with the supplied side post
that doesn't feature these buttons
making it exclusively left or
right-handed popping off the side panels
easy with these small cutaways in the
bottom of the mouse and they snap on
even more easily with a group of small
magnets to add to this rocket is gonna
be facilitating further customization
via 3d printing with an online 3d print
library through shapeways we're going to
be able to choose different pre-designed
side pieces this library already exists
however at the time of this review
there's only pieces available for the
rocket near under the hood the Kuro is
equipped with a fully adjustable 4000
dpi sensor as well as adjustable lift up
hide that can be changed within the
rocket software the response times one
millisecond and polling rate as a
thousand
so basically it's powerful and accurate
enough to you to play any kind of game
and have the ability to adjust
everything the customization extends
further with the rocket swarm software
you're able to customize everything
including the DPI switcher levels
windows pointer speed lighting of texts
and colors button assignment and much
more the software is straightforward and
you can save and switch between
different settings profiles of these
rounding out the software features
gamers are able to track statistics in a
mobile app as well as integrate with
alien effects to pair the lighting
system with their Alienware PC coming in
at just $40 on Amazon the Kiro is a
unique and very good value ambidextrous
mouse with the toc swappable side panels
gamers are able to change the form and
button configuration of their mouse in
seconds and true lefty Mouse users would
be very pleased to see a properly
ambidextrous Mouse from a quality brand
like rocket on top of all the
interesting points of difference that
the Kiro brings the build quality is
true to rock its reputation and this
lightweight design makes it a jalan
speedy for competitive gamers overall
the Cure is a really solid entry into
the ambidextrous market by rocket we'd
have no issues at all recommending it to
our left-handed comrades thanks for
