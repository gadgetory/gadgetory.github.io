today we have a cool build video for you
guys we're building a new computer for
Tim his new editing rigs previously
computer he'll tell you about a computer
in a minute but it's a cool video
because we are building a risin seven
seventeen hundred system and will be
overclocking that seeing our performs in
Premiere Pro and a few other
applications and yeah it'll be a lot
better than what Tim currently has what
are you running at the moment Tim I've
got a core i5 Ivy Bridge systems I think
it's a thirty five seventy not even the
K model I've got 16 gig of ddr3 and a
gtx 980ti
so i primarily built the system for
gaming but yeah when it just comes to
editing at 4k simply not up to it in
terms of its cpu power I think you know
even editing something at 1080p will
almost take 20 minutes to render that
video so it's 4k we know how much how
much more power that uses so you know
exactly over an hour to wait for that to
render it's just not going to cut it so
good to get something a bit more
powerful in a mirror definitely so well
we don't know how they obviously I think
it's three gigahertz out of the box that
boosts up a little bit higher so be sure
to see how it performs out of the box
compared to because we will be
benchmarking Tim's computer that he
currently has as well see how that
handles overclocked the rise and
processor and see how we go with that so
I think it's time so I'm going to make
Tim build this so I'm going to sit back
and watch so time is the fun bit so I'm
410 debilities in your computer we'll
see you guys in a moment
okay so we built the system now I think
it should be pretty powerful and
cost-effective but of course you have to
check out perform so let's get to some
benchmarks all right so before we jump
into the benchmarks I suppose we should
take a brief moment to tell you exactly
what's going into this system obviously
we have the AMD Verizon 7 1700 processor
and we've decided to install on the
gigabyte a be 350 gaming 3 motherboard
which as the name suggests uses the AMD
be 350 chipset since Tim will primarily
be using the system for content creation
we've gone with 32 gigabytes of ddr4
3000 memory though with 4 modules we
were only able to run the memory at ddr4
2666 for storage I have the corsair MP
500 480 gigabyte SSD handy and there's a
high-speed mbm a SSD they should have
Tim well covered Tim's old PC which is
keeping as a backup features the geforce
gtx 980ti so with this new system we
haven't really made much of an upgrade
here as we went with the gtx 1070 that's
if we did use the msi gtx 1070 gaming x
model this is a very nice graphics card
that runs cool and quiet and when tim
isn't busy creating content for us to
watch this will certainly be powerful
enough so Tim can enjoy the latest and
greatest games as a side notes of
benchmarking we replaced the MSI
graphics card with the Titan XP so the
data is comparable with the numbers that
we already have so with that let's get
to it although this isn't primarily a
gaming PC it's a much appreciated
secondary function that Tim will no
doubt enjoy in his spare time
not that he should have much of that now
but anyway out of the box the horizon 7
1700 chip is only a whisker slower than
the 1700 x-men while once overclocked it
pulls ahead of the 1800 X by a slim
margin it is worth noting that the
minimum frame rates are considerably
better than that of Intel's quad-core
7600 K before we move on let's have a
quick look at battlefield one
performance again the rising sea views
off a strong minimum frame rate
performance and here we see that the
overclocked 1700's is able to keep pace
with the $500 u.s. Verizon 7 1800 X even
stocks are 1700
impressive 1,400 points korynn Cinebench
r15 which doesn't place it that far
behind the 1000 and $50 us intel core i7
69 hundred k overclocking boost some
multi-threaded score by 20% producing a
score of 16 thousand and 77 points
impressive stuff indeed now this is what
the system was built for working with
Premiere Pro CC previously exporting a
four and a half minute 4k video took
Tim's core i5 Ivy Bridge PC roughly 15
and a half minutes this means a typical
length however unbox video would take
over an hour to encode hope you don't
make any mistakes on that system Tim
thankfully that won't be an issue though
as the new horizon 7 1700 rig took just
11 minutes to complete the render and
this was before we applied in tweaks
overclocking the chip to 3.0 gigahertz
reduce the render time to just nine
minutes and 26 seconds which is an
incredible time for a 4k video encode in
comparison might own 10 core Core i7 69
50x processor takes 8 minutes and 23
seconds granted that is a whole minute
faster but it's 16,000 and 50 US or 2400
Aussie it's horrible value next to 330
WS or $470 e Verizon 7 1700 well you
guys have seen the benchmarks very
impressive stuff a serious upgrade over
Tim's old PC especially for editing
videos yeah I mean it's 40% faster than
my old system before any overclocking so
previously what was taking you about 15
and a half minutes on a 4k in code
that's been shaved four point five
minutes right off that so down to 11
minutes is a pretty significant saving
there and of course after we overclock
the system we've got another 17%
performance out of it took that encode
down further to just nine point five
minutes so makes it all up about 65%
faster than my old PC which is a really
fantastic result I think around your
system exactly and it's something like
only 11% slower than my 69 50x system
which costs twice as much of course we
can overclock 469 50x and squeeze
somewhere like 10 or 15% more
performance out of it
but again it costs twice as much so
you're going to get nowhere near twice
as fast as what we've built for Tim so I
hope
you guys enjoyed seeing Tim's new
editing rig come together and Tim
certainly now has no excuse for not
creating content I want to see a video
for him in the next week or two be sure
to give him a hard time on social media
if you don't see anything from him
alright guys we'll catch you next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
