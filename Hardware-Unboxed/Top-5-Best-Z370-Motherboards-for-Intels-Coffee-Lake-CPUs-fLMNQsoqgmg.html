checking out my favorite is edit 370
motherboards so it's another top 5 video
and the categories this time include a
best entry-level best of valuable
all-rounder best of the best best
micro-atx and the best mini ITX
motherboard
there's loads of boards to go over and
we have multiple options from the likes
of a soos asrock msi gigabyte supermicro
and EVGA so let's get into it shall we
first up we have my entry-level board
you guys trying to save every last
dollar for the GPU there are a few
candidates here and they're all priced
between 120 and 130 dollars u.s. there's
the asrock zed 370 pro for msi zen 370 a
pro gigabyte a Zed 370 horas gaming
Wi-Fi and their sous Prime is at 370 P
the sous prime is at 370 P well that
board looks ok it's not great but a
decent offering that said though we're
gonna swipe left on that one I swear a
sous is completely incapable of
competitively pricing their motherboards
140 dollars us for a ball with budget
audio and networking and super
underwhelming storage options for $10
less the gigabyte Z 370 Ora scamming
Wi-Fi is an attractive option with its
Intel gigabit networking creative core
3d audio six SATA ports and a wireless
networking with Bluetooth you can also
get the asrock Zed 370 pro 4 at the same
price and while that board has a better
vrm it does away with the Wi-Fi support
in office a cheaper audio solution then
we have the cheapest board and arguably
the best to the MSI Zed 370 a pro now
this unassuming Zed 370 mother bought
over clocks like a champ pushing both
8th gen CPUs and ddr4 memory to the max
the feature set won't blow your socks
off but overall a high quality board
that can't be beat at this price point
so MSI's z 370 a pro wins my best
entry-level board award coming in second
I organized over the as rocker Zed 370
profile and gigabyte Zed 370 horas
gaming Wi-Fi both are selling for a
hundred and thirty dollars us right now
the asrock board is arguably a better
overclocker but the Auris gaming is no
slouch either
for me the gigabyte board is the more
well rounded offering and its really it
offers an unbeatable feature set at this
price point so it's my well deserved
runner
for those willing to spend a little more
there's no shortage of options the
standouts for me include the assist
primes at 370 a MSI Z 370 gaming m5 the
gigabyte Zed 370 horas ultra gaming and
finally at the asrock is ed 370 extreme
for again their soos board it's very
solid but sadly overpriced at 175
dollars u.s. for me it feels more like a
hundred and forty ish dollar motherboard
there are three boards though they're
very evenly matched and that makes
picking one very difficult that being
the case though I don't think you can
really go too wrong having said that
though the gigabyte Zed 370 or ultra
gaming that has suffered a few reports
of high vrm temps I've noticed quite
mixed user reviews online particularly
at newegg.com so with possible issues
there I would look to either the MSI 370
gaming m5 or the asrock zed 370 extreme
4 for me though the asrock Z 370 extreme
port is the winner here the board is not
just the cheapest of the bunch but it
offers a great feature set and a very
solid VRM the user reviews for this one
are also overwhelmingly positive
everywhere you look I'd also like to add
that the asrock UEFI is incredibly easy
to navigate and overclocking is a breeze
even for novice users still if you can't
get a Zed 370 extreme for then a worthy
alternative would be MSI's Zed 370
gaming m5 it's also a very awesome
looking another board as well
right so you want the best of the best
and you don't care if your mother would
cost more than your CPU you've got money
to burn well in that case you can skip
over gigabyte now zarach at least for
now
both are far too reserved for the likes
of you $220 per gigabytes gaming 7 or as
rocks Taichi
you don't have time for that mainstream
rubbish a Seuss also offers a number of
high end balls like the ROG Maximus X
apex an interesting looking board for
$350 u.s. the focus for the apex is on
overclocking and that comes with a
number of compromises making this
specialist motherboard a bit too focus
for this category
then there's the Maximus X formula now a
Seuss's K - that one in what they call
thermal armor I believe it's just
plastic I've got an older z77 board with
the same sort of stuff this one does
look actually worse but even so I feel
like that kind of plastic shroud design
it's just a bit tacky and probably out
of place on a motherboard costing $450
u.s. that's just my opinion anyway
there's also the MSI XIII 70 godlike at
an insane $500 u.s. but it's a pretty
awesome motherboard that one still MSI
is gone a bit overboard on the plastic
bits here as well and for reasons I'll
never understand they've shielded vrm
heat sinks from airflow using plastic
covers they've got RGB though so worth
it
am i right seriously though I can't
really give MSI too much of a hard time
over that the Zed 370 godlike is an
amazing motherboard I've been able to
reach an incredible 5.3 gigahertz
overclock with the 87 okay and that is
something that no other Zed 370 board
that I've tested yet can replicate
despite the plastic shrouds though the
vrm temp under full load remains
surprisingly low we're talking around 70
degrees here which is most impressive so
a well-deserved win here for MSI even if
the board does cost $500 u.s. though the
feature set is unlike anything
reform
if you've got twenty four point four by
twenty four point four centimeters worth
of motherboard trader Phil which is at
370 motherboard should you get well your
options are extremely limited
unfortunately there are just three ways
to go that I'm aware of and just one of
them makes sense
the asrock said 370 m pro 4 is the
obvious choice here and it's the micro
ATX version of this similar-sounding is
M 370 pro for that we looked at earlier
price to $130 us you get a very solid
VRM four dimm slots six SATA ports intel
gigabit lan and two pcie 3.0 x 16 slots
though of course the second slot is only
wired for x for bandwidth for
considerably more we once again find in
a seuss motherboard this time the ROG
Strix Zed 370 jjigae me that can be had
for $185 us but he will be hard-pressed
to work out what you're getting for that
extra $55 a soos does offer a better
audio solution you also get wireless
networking with a few extra USB ports
that said you also get tightly packed
PCIe x 16 slots and verum heat sinks
without proper fins
then there's the insanely underwhelming
EVGA z3 7121 KS e 375 kr you have to
wonder what it is about the model names
of monitors that made EVGA think hey
that's pretty slick let's do the same
for our motherboards anyway horrible
naming aside seriously put that right
out of your mind because you're gonna
need all the available processing power
to tackle the price it's $200 u.s. yep
$200 u.s. and you get nothing more than
a single Intel gigabit network
connection no wireless networking basic
Realtek ALC 12:20 codec standard storage
configuration and a basic USB
configuration I do mean basic there is
no type-c so at that price point I think
we can just skip that one all together
so as rockin there practical little zip
370 m pro 4 wins this category
almost by default
now I know what you're thinking micro
ATX motherboards and they're pretty big
but don't worry we do have something
smaller there are quite a few nice mini
ITX said 370 motherboards on offer and
these three most expensive and best
include the isuzu ROG Strix z3 78 gaming
for $190 us as well as the asrock
fatalities at 370 gaming ITX / AC and
the MSI z3 70 id gaming Pro carbon a see
both of those cost $180 us of those
three boards I don't think you can
really go to wrong I do like the a drop
board though for its plethora of USB 3.0
ports including a type C on the i/o
panel
it also offers all six SATA ports along
with an m2 port on the back of the board
the VRM is solid and you get Thunderbolt
3 Intel wired and wireless networking
along with a nice audio solution
the MSI model lacks the same degree of
USB 3.0 support it does drop two of the
SATA ports and of the four that remain
they are very poorly positioned in my
opinion so of the two I am leaning
towards the asrock model then there's
your soos ROG Strix Zed 370 I gaming
which does only cost $10 more and
arguably is the best looking board in
terms of aesthetics it does also offer
true m dot 2 ports though it does only
support four SATA ports the vrm on this
one looks great so for me I would be
tossing up between this a sous model and
the fatalities at 317 gaming ITX AC I
have to admit I'm not really a fan of
the gigabyte Zed 370 and Wi-Fi 160
dollars u.s. it is a good bit cheaper
than the other two models we just
discussed that the vrm isn't nearly as
impressive that said though the rest of
the feature set is pretty solid however
you can get a similar level of features
from the $135 us as rockers at 370 m ITX
AC so if I was after an affordable Zed
370 Mini ITX motherboard that's what I
would go with so for this category I'm
going to call it a tie between the
asrock and a soos boards because I
honestly can't pick a winner here it'll
really come down to which one you prefer
the look of and how they're priced in
your region
anyway I make up the rules and I say
this category can have two
there's already loads of great said 370
motherboards to choose from pricing
starts at a little over $100 us a sous
asrock MSI an gigabyte have all done a
great job with their boards and as I
said earlier for the most part you
really can't go wrong anyway I hope
these picks have helped you out and if
you happen to agree or disagree with me
feel free to jump down the comment
section below and let us know about it
