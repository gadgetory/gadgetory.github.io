today's video is your classic build
video and one I'm particularly excited
about because I'm finally upgrading my
personal editing rig here and gaming rig
to something much faster something that
will seriously rip through the encoding
of our videos and provide a better
gaming experience as well so here is my
current rig are used for editing all my
videos on hard ROM box and it's showing
its age at this point this is largely
the same PC I built on the channel when
I first joined back at the start of 2017
but with I guess a few changes the big
one was I had to replace my a soos
crosshair 6 hero motherboard due to a
fault with the Dumas lot so I'm
currently using a pretty mediocre
gigabyte a be 350 gaming 3 motherboard
which doesn't handle overclocking my
rise in 7 1700 X very well let's just
say it has a few vrm problems when
overclocking up near the 3.9 gigahertz
mark which my previous X through 70
board had no problems with thousand
seven 1700 X has been great for me so
far but as a professional Video Editor
it's time to pull out the big guns so
over here we have the AMD thread Ripper
2950 X which will become the core of my
upgraded editing rig this thing is a
serious beautiful productivity workloads
like video encoding and should provide a
massive performance improvement over the
1700 X 4 stuff I do basically every day
on the channel the 1700 X is also fine
for video encoding it still holds up
well for most tasks but it's struggling
a little bit with the graphics
comparison videos we've been putting up
on the channel lately when you overlay
up to 5 high bitrate 4k 60fps videos and
try and preview it the horizon 7 1700 X
is on struggle Street but with the
thread Ripper 2950 X instead I'll be
getting a ton more CPU horsepower and
memory bandwidth to speed our previewing
and encoding on top of that the 2950 X
is also faster than the 1700 X 4 gaming
which is I guess a bonus as there's my
editing rig for a bit of gaming as well
it benefits from 2nd gen reasons
improved latency and of course with Cox
higher than the 1700 X especially
considering I was only topping out at
around 3.8 gigahertz on my previous CPU
for the motherboard there's really only
one choice here and that is the msi Meg
x3 99 creation this is a beast of a
board it's got a massive vrm on it and
that should comfortably handle the 29
50x overclocks but it should also give
plenty of headroom for ambe's future
through every per cpu should I choose to
upgrade down the line I really like the
design as well it's got an awesome
feature set and really should provide
the ultimate platform for thread Ripper
while not really necessary for video
editing I've decided to swap out my
Titan X Pascal that was used in my old
rig you can see it in there for the
gigabyte r-tx 20 80 TI gaming OC this
should give me a handy performance boost
in gaming and will make it a bit easier
to evaluate things like ray tracing as I
go without having to switch to my test
system all the time the rest of the
components they come from Corsair I'm
currently using a cool master case as
you can see over here it's not the
prettiest thing going around so swapping
that out for a Corsair obsidian 500d
it's not on the table here but if we
will be using that for the bill in just
a moment now you might be thinking will
the beastly X 399 creation motherboard
actually fit inside the 500 d which
technically isn't designed to fit
extended ATX motherboards well don't
worry I checked it it does fit with
slightly reduced space for cable
management and I'm pretty relieved about
that because I love the way the case
looks then for the cooling we have the
corsair h 150 i pro over here with the
TI 4 mounting kit as well that's
definitely overkill for the 2950 ex but
this should give I guess the most
Headroom for precision boost - and even
precision boost overdrive order
overclocking if I decide to go down that
path in any case I was using a pretty
basic air cooler with my 1700 X it was
pretty loud under load with the H 150 I
Pro won't be complaining about noise
anymore that's for sure and then finally
at the front here we have the Corsair RM
850 X power supply 80 plus gold
certified should provide plenty of power
for this CPU and GPU combination and
that will be replacing a Thermaltake 600
watt unit was used in this thing my
existing PSU is fine perhaps a little
noisy under load but we needed more
power so I had no choice but to upgrade
to one of these from Corsair and then
there's a whole bunch of components I'll
be keeping from this old build we'll
take those out in a moment no need to
get used
for stuff that I already had that's
perfectly fine on the memory side in
there is 32 gigabytes of course their
vengeance ddr4 3000 with white LEDs they
provided for a bill a while back also be
keeping my entire suite of storage and
hoes for my valuable files and all that
so my course airforce MP 500 and got to
drive crucial MX 300 and then there's to
see get eight terabyte drives in there
as well all those will be transitioning
over and then finally we have my Elgato
4k 60 pro capture card that will be
coming across as well I've been using
this for all my 4k game captures you've
been singing my videos lately and it
just works really well no complaints
here alright so this is all the new
stuff that's going into the build got to
take a few things out of here in just a
moment
I guess it's time to get building
all right so here it is my new editing
rig one thing I'm already noticing is
just how quiet it's running with the
Corsair h 150 i pro inside my previous
editing room was pretty noisy but I'm
certainly very impressed with how this
thing is running at the moment I'll soon
be figuring out just how fast the thread
Ripper 2950 X's I've got to go edit this
video so I'm expecting a pretty
significant performance improvement over
the horizon 7 1700 X and then of course
for gaming as well the RT X xx attr will
give me a notice will jump in frame rate
and that will help me out in some of
those competitive shooters and all that
sort of thing so yeah really looking
forward to using this test system full
time from now on I reckon it's going to
hit those three key areas I really want
to upgrade and improve with this new
boot which was getting it to be run run
a lot quieter and already doing that
much better performance for video
editing of course thread Ripper 2950 X
and improved gaming performance as well
so all across the board there I think
I've tackle each of those three things
of course big thanks to all the people
that helped put this bill together AMD
for the 29 50 X guys like MSI to the
creation motherboard gigabyte for the
2082 and of course Corsair for all of
the components that go into our builds
here at hardware arm boxed it's been a
long day here so I'm gonna get off this
video and get to you know figuring out
what this system is like to use so I
guess we'll see you guys in the next one
