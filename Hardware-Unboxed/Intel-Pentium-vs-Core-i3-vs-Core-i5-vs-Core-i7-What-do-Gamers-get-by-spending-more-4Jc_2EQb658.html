video that compares gaming performance
of various Intel processors from gamers
perspective of course the driving force
behind this idea has been you guys the
hardware unbox tribe my loyal sub-region
it's an interesting question that isn't
easily answered hence the need to create
this video ultimately it comes down to
two things first and foremost the types
of games you play if Rama succeeds is
all your plan on playing for example
then don't bother upgrading that core i3
it won't get you any extra performance
this is because Rainbow six siege is
primarily a GPU bound game which means
you'll be far better off investing in
your graphics card than your CPU for
this title on the other hand games such
as civilization beyond Earth for example
require great deal of cpu firepower and
this is where your money we best spend
for performance gains of course we're
talking about gaming performance so
regardless of the title the GPU plays a
key role in fact your graphics card
really dictates just how useful your CPU
is going to be even in CPU intensive
games for example pairing a low end GPU
such as the Radeon r7 370 with a
powerful processor such as the core i7
6700 K won't be doing you any favors
this is because a much slower processor
such as the core i3 6100 will deliver
the same performance regardless of how
CPU intensive the title is so obviously
there's a balance to be had between CPU
and GPU power there probably being
finding that perfect balance in an
effort to discover this I'll be testing
a huge range of Intel skylake processors
from the lowly pentium g 4400 to the
mighty kora 760 700 K using three
different GPUs the graphics cards in
question of the Radeon r9 fury acts
r9 390 and i9 380 please note that due
to the fact I've tested eight Schaick
processors using three different
graphics cards only five games have been
used however I feel these five games
paint a very clear picture and by that I
mean they give a good indication with
CPUs best compliment which graphics
cards even though I've only tested five
titles there's a good mix of CPU and GPU
intensive games the mostly GPU intensive
games used include Far Cry primal
and rise of the Tomb Raider while the
CPU intensive games include The Witcher
3 Wild Hunt civilization beyond Earth
and ashes of the singularity finally I'd
just like to point out that all testing
takes place at 1080p there's little
point testing CPU performance at any
resolution greater than 1080p as high
resolutions will result in GPU
bottlenecks in fact we're already seeing
is a 1080p on the i-90 380 so if you're
running at 1440p or higher for example
you can expect the performance margins
to be reduced when compared to what I'm
about to show you ok so far cry primal
doesn't support dual core processors as
many of the game's main assets run on
the third thread so I couldn't test the
Pentium processors moving forward we see
that even with a fury X installed the
game doesn't appear particularly CPU
intensive as the core i3 6100 was just
10% slower than the 6700 K when
comparing the minimum frame rate
interestingly despite the slight
variation in the minimum frames the
majority of the processors tested
produced the same 72 FPS average frame
rate lowering the GPU rendering power
with the radiant I know 390 we see that
the core i3 Core i5 and core i7
processors all deliver the same
performance downgrading the GPU further
with the r9 380 we again find that all
tested processors deliver the same
performance
rise of the Tomb Raider can make good
use of multi-core processors but I
wouldn't describe it as CPU intensive
here the core i7 6700 K was just 14
percent faster than the G 4400 when
comparing the minimum frame rates while
the core i5 6400 was just 8 percent
faster now with the I 9 390 installed
the core i7 6700 K is just 7 percent
faster than the G 4400 what's a very
slim margin indeed that said the G 4400
clearly wasn't hitting the same high as
the average frame rate was a bit slower
though this was corrected with the G 45
20 here we see that with the r9 380
installed all eight processes deliver
pretty much the same result in fact all
of them do with the exception of the G
4400 which was a whiskey slower
despite testing The Witcher 3 in the CPU
intensive town of novigrad we don't see
a huge difference in performance from
the G 4400 to the 6700 K when using the
fury X in fact here the 6700 K was just
8% faster which I have to say was a real
surprise
moving to the r9 390 saw a much larger
variation in performance when comparing
the dual core Pentium processors
the four threaded core i3 and ultimately
quad core Core i7 processors it's a bit
strange that this wasn't seen with the
fury X but these are much more in line
with the results that I was expecting to
find here the core i3 6100 was able to
get the most out of the Radeon r9 390
and was 22% faster than the G 4400 the
core i5 6400 was actually slightly
slower than the core i3 processors due
to its much weaker core clock speed now
with the lowly r9 380 installed it
appears that the processor becomes far
less important as the Pentium G 45 20
was able to match the core i3 i5 and i7
processors probably the most CPU
intensive game featured in this video is
civilization beyond Earth here the 6700
K was 66 percent faster than the G 44
hundred and fifty-six percent faster
than the G 45 20 when comparing the
minimum frame rate the 6700 K was also
33% faster than the core i3 63 20 and
10% faster than the 6600 K going with a
slower GPU in the o9 390 only reduced
the 6700 K is lead over the G 4400 by a
small amount as it's now 61 percent
faster the low clocked Core i5 6400 was
only able to match the core i3 63 20 you
want a much higher clock 6600 K match
the 6700 even with the iodine 380
handling the rendering work the 6700 K
was still 53% faster than the G 4400
which dropped down to the 32 FPS it's
important to note that while the average
frame rates don't show much of a
difference in performance the minimums
tell a different story
ashes of the singularity provides us
with a look at both DirectX 11 and
DirectX 12 performance unfortunately I'm
only able to compare the average frame
rates as the game doesn't report the
minimum frame rate and I've no other
means of recording and under DirectX 12
as programs like fraps don't work
nevertheless the results are very
interesting the Pentium results the most
noteworthy for a few reasons firstly
although the DirectX 11 performance is
quite weak when compared to the mighty
Core i7 processors it isn't that bad
when compared to the core i3 and lower
clocked Core i5 6400 processors the
pentium g 4400 was 24% slower than the
core i5 6400 for example not a bad
result given the Core i5 processor has
twice as many cores to play with however
once we move to DirectX 12 G 4400
becomes 28% slower than the 6400 well
the Pentium Pro
is fall behind the core i3 processors
are able to roughly match the core i5s
and therefore the core i7 processors it
is worth noting that although the
Pentium processors didn't perform as
well under DirectX 12 they still
received a healthy 45% performance boost
when compared to DirectX 11 similar
performance trends are seen when using
yarn and 390 G 4400 received 47%
performance boost when using DirectX 12
this mean it was still over 20% slower
than the core i3 processors in the more
modern api on the other hand the core i3
i5 and i7 processors all delivered
similar performance when using DirectX
12 now using the r9 380 the GPUs limits
seem to be reached at 39 fps under
DirectX 11 as evidenced by the core i7
6700 and 6700 K results this meant that
the G 4400 was 28% slower while the core
i3 in Core i5 6400 processors were just
8% slower
retesting using DirectX 12 we find that
all eight processors produce the exact
same result of 41 fps so what can we
take away from all this testing well
firstly as many of you already know
there isn't a great deal of difference
between the core i5 and core i7
processors when it comes to gaming this
is particularly true when comparing the
unlocked 6600 K and 6700 K processors to
higher frequencies such as four and a
half gigahertz and beyond looking at the
other end of the core i5 spectrum we
find the core i5 6400 a processor that
can't work any faster than 3.3 gigahertz
and will often be found running below
three gigahertz during heavy loads as a
result the higher clocked core i3
processors were able to match and even
beat the 6400 in CPU intensive games
such as civilization using the following
line graphs as an example we see the
core i3 6320 is capable of matching the
core i5 6400 when using high-end GPUs
such as the fury X 6600 K is 6700 are
also comparable while the 6700 K only
appears faster due to its higher
out-of-the-box operating frequency it's
clear that civilization in games like it
played best when at least four threads
are available providing you meet that
criteria the next important criteria is
the clock speed of the physical cores
the importance of the CPU clock speed
becomes obvious when comparing the two
Core i5 processors however although
civilization is primarily a CPU bound
game the performance difference between
say the G 4400
6,700 k wouldn't be as extreme with
lower end GPUs in fact out of interest I
threw in the gtx 750ti a popular choice
amongst budget gamers what I found was
every single one of the CPUs featured in
this video allow for an average frame
rate of 45 FPS with a minimum of 31 FPS
this then is why it's so important to
match your GPU to your CPU or vice versa
the budget game is using low end GPUs
that little need for a core i5 processor
as it's very rarely going to be more
useful in a core i3 or in this case a
dual core Pentium processor it is
becoming harder and harder to justify
investing in a dual core processor like
the $60 G 4400 still given the
performance that can be had in most
modern titles along with the fact that
it cost half as much as the core i3 6100
you can't go to wrong conveniently
picking up an affordable Pentium
processor now still leaves the option to
upgrade down the track so it's not a
dead end scenario rise of the Tomb
Raider for example plays surprisingly
well on modern dual-core processors such
as the G 4400 or G 45:20 in fact
depending on the GPU being used there
might be little to no performance gain
to be had when opting for a more
powerful Core i5 or Core i7 processor so
the answer to which CPU do I need still
isn't a simple one but it ultimately
comes down to which games you play in to
a lesser degree the graphics card you'll
be using as a rule of thumb sub $100
CPUs should be paired with the modern
GPU they cost an excess of $150 the GTX
950 or r7 370 would be suitable the core
i3 processors work well with the gtx 960
or r9 380 while the core i5 and faster
are best paired the I know 390 gtx 970
or faster i hope you found this video
useful
I'm your host Matt as always if you have
any questions at all then please leave
them in the comments have a great day
