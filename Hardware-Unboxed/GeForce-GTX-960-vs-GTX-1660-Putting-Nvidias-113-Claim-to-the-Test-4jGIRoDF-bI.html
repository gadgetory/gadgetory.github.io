you still have a GeForce GTX 960
graphics card and have you been holding
out for a worthwhile upgrade for
something that costs around the same
$200 you spent all those years ago well
if so then this video will be of
interest which is probably why you
clicked on it hmm anyway why am i
comparing this now four year old
graphics card with much newer graphics
cards such as the GTX 1660 I've got the
MSI gaming X model here I also have the
game II X and gaming Z versions of the
60 and 60 TI + RT X 2060 and we've got
about 10 other graphics cards as well
but why am i comparing this old banger
to these new graphics cards and the
reason is it's well it's a throwback
video and we haven't well we've never
actually done a throwback video for the
GTX 960 so it's not a although this is
the 2019 version there wasn't a 2018 a
2017 or 2016 version of this four year
old graphics card so for some reason
it's just flowing under the radar and we
haven't really given it a dedicated
video so that's all going to change now
part of the reason why I've decided to
focus on the GTX 960 is because of some
claims made by Nvidia in the review
guide they said that the new GT x16 60
was a whopping 113 percent faster than
the GTX 960 and that makes it the
perfect upgrade option for those with
this mid-range Maxwell GPU still in
their rig spitting out whatever frames
it can in modern games and since the GTX
960 is the fifth most popular GPU
amongst Steam users seems there are
still plenty of you still using it
before we get to the benchmarks though
here are just a few quick stats about
the geforce gtx 960 it packs just 1,024
cuda cores that's 27 percent less than
the 1660 and they're clocked 34% lower
there's also 33% fewer ops and while
both make use of gddr5 memory the 960
has 42% less memory bandwidth due to the
fact that in part users lower clocked
memory
but more crucially a narrower 120 bit
wide memory bus okay enough about stats
let's talk about the testing for this
one I'll be looking closely at
performance at 1080p and a dozen titles
and then we'll jump to the typical 33
game breakdown comparing the 1660 and
960 head-to-head and finally a few quick
notes on the test system here we've used
the corer 919 or okay clocked at 5
gigahertz with 32 gigabytes of ddr4
3,200 memory as for the drivers we used
adrenalin 2019 Edition nineteen point
two point three for the Radeon GPUs and
game ready for 1935 WH GL for the
GeForce GPUs ok let's get into the
results playing apex legends it's handy
P with the higher quality preset isn't
that much fun with the GTX 960 you're
looking at frame rates that are
consistently well below 60 fps so far
from ideal when playing a fast-paced
first-person shooter for those of you
not wanting to reduce the visual quality
settings we'll have to upgrade and
something like the new gtx 1660 offers a
healthy 136 percent performance boost
with 106 FPS on average moving on to the
recently released the division 2 and we
find a pretty dire situation with the
gtx 960 just 27 FPS on average basically
the games unplayable using the ultra
quality preset at le p and middle e
though the game is quite demanding with
these high quality settings so those of
you looking to upgrade to at gtx 1660
can look forward to a pretty mega 152
percent performance boost not too bad
that though I should note if you're only
looking at playing the division 2 then
something like an Rx 590 might be a
better choice and I believe right now
you do get a free copy of the division 2
with radeon GPU purchases or maybe
that's just the rise in cpus don't
you'll have to look into that one moving
on we find a similar situation when
testing with shadow of the Tomb Raider
using the highest quality preset the old
GeForce GPU sped out just 34 FPS on
average and with frame dips into the 20s
it was pretty horrible under these
conditions I think it's fair to say
meanwhile the 124 percent performance
bump offered
by the GTX 1660 metagame could now be
enjoyed in all of its glory at 1080p has
to be said the GTX 960 does a decent job
in Forza horizon 4 though this decent
performance can be mostly attributed to
how well optimised Forza horizon 4 is
still you will have to use the 4
gigabyte model if you want to see the
kind of performance that we're showing
here and even then the GTX 1660 still
offered a 126 percent performance boost
hitting 95 FPS on average and with over
twice as many frames pumped out each
second it did offer a significantly
smoother gaming experience
hitman 2 was also playable with the
geforce gtx 960 you know really wouldn't
take too much to dial back the quality
things to achieve that glorious 60fps
that said if you want to enjoy hitman
with the ultra quality settings enabled
then something like a gtx 1660 is the
way to go as spat out a much more
impressive 93 FPS on average testing
with just'cause force or the new budget
cheering GPU delivered just over twice
as many frames when compared to the gtx
960 the jump up from 32 FPS to 65 FPS
really is very massive and it makes
leaping and flying around while you
attack enemies much easier and perhaps
more importantly much more enjoyable
think it's fair to say we're starting to
see a pretty consistent trend here
testing with Resident Evil 2 saw the gtx
1660 providing 129 percent more
performance at iupi with the maximum
quality preset enabled this more than
doubling of the frame rate obviously led
to significant improvements in gameplay
and while this isn't a game that
necessarily needs big frame rates the
smoother motion certainly adds to the
experience of all the games we've
benchmarked so far fortnight is by far
the least demanding as such the GTX 960
was good for 52 FPS on average and we
are also using the epic quality preset
which is the highest quality preset
available in the game so with
competitive settings which most
fort-like players like to use the 960
would be pushing over 60 FPS at 1080p
however if you want a 144 FPS or perhaps
even more FPS with competitive settings
the GTX 1660 will be required
and even with the epic preset enabled
it's still averaged 113 fps Metro Exodus
is a new and very demanding title the
gtx 1660 for example cut quite average
60fps attorney p with the ultra quality
preset enabled that said it is a darn
sight better than the 27 FPS on average
you'd be getting with the aging gtx 960
so there is that I must admit I expected
the gtx 960 to do quite well in Rainbow
six siege and while 48 FPS on average is
playable I was actually expecting it to
be a little better than that though come
to think of it I'm not exactly sure why
given the rx 570 does only render 69 FPS
on average in our test this means the
upgrade to the gtx 1660 would net you a
healthy 146 percent performance bump
hitting 118 FPS on average now this is
an interesting result as it's one of
these smallest margins that we found for
the 1660 over the 960 across the 33
games test and here the churring GPU was
just 81% faster yes just 81 percent
faster obviously that's still a really
big margin but given we've typically
seen more than double the performance
out of the 1660 this one is a bit of a
surprise especially given that
battlefield 5 is a very modern very
demanding first-person shooter anyway 81
percent it is although World of Tanks
has recently received a major overhaul
we are testing with the HD client it's
still very well optimised for all the
hardware for example the GTX 960 was
still good for 55 FPS on average and
that's very playable performance for
this title still if you seek more
performance than the GTX 1660 can help
you out with a nice 91% performance bump
the last game we're going to look
closely at is Far Cry new dawn and here
the GTX 960 also had enough grunt for
playable performance at 1080p using the
ultra quality preset so that's pretty
impressive and it really speaks to how
well optimised this title is still if
you want to keep frame rates well above
60fps at all times
then the 98 percent performance boost
you'll get from the GTX 1660 will be
very well
now when it comes to power consumption
we see just how impressively churring
based GTX 1660 really is in terms of
efficiency despite often offering twice
as much performance as the GTX 960 it
pushed total system consumption usage
just 16% higher hitting 262 watts still
it has to be said even by today's
standards the GTX 960
it isn't terrible and you'll get away
with a very modest power supply okay so
we've seen how the gtx 960 performs in
modern titles at terapy using dial-up
quality settings and it's not great but
it's also what you'd expect from a
four-year old budget mid-range graphics
card I don't know if you'd call it low
end or mid range let's just go the
budget mid range seems to sort of cover
us on both fronts there anyway the gtx
960 it went on sale way back in 2015 for
$200 u.s. so that was the MSRP for that
particular model though that was for the
two gigabyte version the four gigabyte
version that I tested that was around I
think forty to fifty dollars more it's
hard to say exactly cuz I don't recall
the exact prices back then but from
memory it was about forty to fifty
dollars more and back then that kind of
price premium certainly wasn't worth it
today though the two gigabyte model will
lag behind quite a bit and chances are
you probably have the two gigabyte model
I don't think there was that many 4
gigabyte cards salt they really only
made sense quite late in the game when
it probably didn't make sense to buy a
GTX 960 but anyway if you do have a true
gigabyte model then the performance
uplift will be even greater so it makes
even more sense to upgrade to something
like the gtx 1660 as you might have
expected based on the 13 games that we
just looked at closely the gtx 1660 is
for the most part more than twice as
fast as the gtx 960 on average at 1080p
we're looking at a 117 percent
performance boost so that's obviously
pretty massive and it means in video a
right on the money when they claimed a
113 percent performance boost that
amounts to an almost 30 percent
performance uplift per year so it is
hard to argue that's not a good deal
granted the gtx 1660 does cost 22
thirty dollars more than what the 960
cost upon release or at the MSRP and
that 10 to 15% price increase isn't
ideal I suppose but it's not exactly
unreasonable either given that the
Radeon rx 588 gigabyte cost $190 us
right now placing it roughly on par with
the GTX 1660 in terms of cost per frame
this does mean the GTX 960 owners have
had a similar value option in the RX 580
for quite some time now and I guess that
does make the GTX 1660 a little less
exciting though to be fair the 1660 is a
faster product on the RX 5a so it is
still quite exciting
om because no one will mention this in
the comment section below the radio rx
580 comes with two free games apparently
I am contractually obligated to mention
the free games bundle every time I
discuss a radio and GP you must be
somewhere in the fine print anyway that
is going to do it for this one there's
quite clearly a number of very solid
upgrade options for those of you still
using a rusty old gtx 960 so if you want
something like the 1660 1660 TI or maybe
even a radeon RX v 8 if you can grab one
of them on sale then yeah plenty of
options there that will offer you quite
a lot more performance I hope you guys
enjoyed the benchmarks and remember you
can jump over to our patreon page for
all 33 graphs if you want to take a
closer look at any of the games that we
did or didn't discuss in this video
thank you for watching I'm your host
