corner I've been traveling a bit this
week so haven't been keeping up with
absolutely everything going on in the
tech space but a couple of interesting
things did happen this week that I'll be
talking about including the first
benchmarks for KB Lake G with RX Vega
graphics as rocks official announcement
of phantom gaming cards NVIDIA Quadro GV
100 and more so first up let's talk
about those asrock phantom gaming
graphics cards as expected as ROC has
entered the graphics card market as an
AMD add-in board pata and their very
first set of four phantom gaming cards
covers the Radeon rx 500 series
unfortunately there are no custom Vega
cards here with asrock instead of
covering the mid-range and entry-level
product segments first but hopefully
that'll happen further down the track
the naming scheme for these new cards
it's pretty simple the rx 550 and rx 560
carry the phantom gaming brand with a
simple 2g at the end of the name and
that indicates the memory capacity while
the RX v 7t + RX 580 our phantom gaming
X cards with 8g OC at the end despite
the lower end rx 550 and rx 560 not
carrying an OC in their name they are
also overclockable like the higher end
cards using a setting in as rocks
overclocking utility in fact that's how
you access the factory overclock on all
of these cars they'll ship with AMD
default clocks and a simple button in
the utility will push those clocks up by
40 or 50 megahertz as rock has developed
the coolers for all the graphics cards
themselves the rx 570 and 580 get a dual
fan solution with an aluminium radiator
copper base and three heat pipes the RX
560 and rx 550 uses smaller single fan
design with an aluminium radiator that's
designed to be compatible with mini ITX
systems asrock even mentions premium
thermal grease and of course there are
display port HDMI and DVI outputs on
these cards you'll be able to purchase
phantom gaming cards in
to 2018 at least let's hope so with the
current mining situation no pricing has
been announced
probably that so asrock can set the
price to match whatever is the going
market price at the time of launch
earlier today the first reviews went
live for Intel's latest Hades Canyon NOC
powered by KB Lake G we should be
getting a sample soon to test for
ourselves but I thought I'd quickly go
through some results to show how the NOC
and the core i7 8800 9 G performs so a
quick recap the i7 88 0 9 G is the
highest-end kb lake and qi processor on
the CPU side there are 4 cores and 8
threads with a base clock of 3.1 and a
maximum turbo of 4.2 gigahertz the
biggest inclusion is the AMD Radeon rx
mega M GPU with 24 compute units a base
clock of 1063 megahertz and a boost
clock of 1190 megahertz pair with 4
gigabytes of HBM - this all fits within
a 100 watt TDP and there's even Intel
integrated graphics for low-power tasks
when the AMD GPU isn't required kb lake
g is specifically designed to provide
decent levels of graphics performance
when paired with that Intel H series
like quad-core CPU on a single package
so that om is looking to build laptops
and small form-factor pcs have a single
integrated compact solution capable of
1080p gaming it should be noted that
while the nook as expected uses the
top-tier 100 watt cable 8g processor
most laptops will opt for the 65 watt
variant with a 20 Cu Vega GPU instead
looking at a number of reviews most of
which have fairly limited test results
it seems the ice of an AC 809 g2 of is
GPU performance between an NVIDIA GTX
1050 Ti and a GTX 1060 though on the
closer end to the GTX 1050 Ti that's
impressive for what is essentially an
integrated GPU and the CPU also appears
to perform well and edge ahead of the
popular
i7 7700 HQ hopefully our unit will
arrive soon so we can provide you with
our own set of results across a range of
games so at GTCC 2018 this week Nvidia
announced the quad road
v100 professional GPU which in many ways
is similar to the other Volta products
NVIDIA has announced so far the Titan V
and the Tesla V 100 all three used the
massive GV 100 GPU with 5120 CUDA cores
though the Quadro GV 100 provides a huge
32 gigabytes of faster HBM to up from 12
gig on the Titan v which I guess
explains why it costs $9,000 instead of
just 3,000 this new quad row card will
provide 14.8 teraflops of
single-precision performance and 7.4
teraflops of double precision plus you
get a hundred 18.5 teraflops of tensor
processing if you can afford two of
these beasts you can connect them
together with invidious envy link to to
pool resources and demolish those
compute workloads in video also announce
the DG x2 at GTCC which is a deep
learning system that for some reason
Nvidia calls a GPU anyway it actually
has a bunch of GPUs in its 16 Tesla V
100's to be precise along with jewel
zeal and platinum cpus 1.5 terabytes of
system memory and 30 terabytes of nvme
SSDs when you pull the Tesla V 100
resources you get 512 gigabytes of HP m2
and to petaflop of tensor compute
performance this whole system only draws
10 kilowatts of power and will be
available for a cheap $400,000 in q3
this year so I know a lot of you guys
out there will be rushing out to
purchase one of those notebook check
discovered NVIDIA has quietly launched a
slower variant of their MX 150 discrete
GPU that has been designed for 13-inch
notebooks the 1d 10 variant is the
standard model we've been seeing in
large laptops for a while while the 1d
twelve variant has a more strict power
limit so it can fit into smaller thin
and light systems while there are no
published edp's for each vari the 1d 10
is approximately 25 watts while the 1d
12 appears to be more like 10 watts this
power limit means clock speeds are
reduced on both the GPU and mem
Murray down from 1532 megahertz on the
GPU boost and 15 or two megahertz on the
memory to just ten thirty eight
megahertz boost and 1253 media hurts
memory notebook check says this causes a
twenty to twenty-five percent
performance hit relative to the fully
fledged MX 150 annoyingly as well and
video doesn't have a separate brand for
the one day twelve variant so there's no
way for a consumer to know whether
they're getting the full MX 150 or the
slow MX 150 however at least luckily so
far the 1d twelve has only been spotted
in 13-inch devices this new 1d 12 m x
150 entering the market seems to
coincide with the announcement of a lot
of 13 inch laptops with the MX 150
inside so I wouldn't be surprised if
invidious specifically launched this new
variant to combat rise and mobile and
its integrated graphics that already
blows away Intel's 8th gen parts the new
MX 150 allows NVIDIA to pair up with
Intel for faster graphics in 13-inch
notebooks and that allows both companies
to compete more strongly with AMD and
even keep a and B which is relative
newcomer completely out of the market
this week we ran a couple of quick polls
on Twitter and YouTube
about the GPU and GPU configurations in
your systems just to get a better idea
of what you guys are actually using and
hopefully that will be a bit more
accurate than the steam hardware survey
that's influenced recently by a lot of
different factors we asked you guys
whether you were using an AMD Radeon on
video GeForce graphics card and the
results were pretty similar in both
polls on YouTube we've got 11,000
responses with 68% of you saying you
currently have an NVIDIA GPU and 32% AMD
that number was slightly higher for
Nvidia on Twitter with 2.6 thousand
responses at 71% versus 20 and 9% we
also asked you whether you use crossfire
or SLI multi-gpu setups are offered just
a single GPU on YouTube from 13,000
responses 90% of you said you don't use
either tech with 6% for SLI and 5% for
crossfire presumably with some strange
rounding there by youtube on twitter
from 2,000 votes
88% opted for neither tech 8% for
and 4% for crossfire it's not surprising
to see in video still the favorite GPU
of our viewers that their market share
is nowhere near as high as in the steam
hardware survey I was a little surprised
to see around 10% of people still use
crossfire or SLI and considering how
poorly these technologies are supported
in modern games but I guess judging by a
few of the comments it does seem affair
of those systems that you guys have been
telling us about are using older
graphics cards in a dual GPU setup a few
quick topics to jump into now and this
one I'm really excited about chrome 66
will block unwanted Auto playing videos
with sound from all of those annoying
news websites Auto playing videos with
sound on a news article is extremely
annoying and such a garbage practice so
it's great to see Google cracking down
on those internet criminals Google have
outlined their rules for when Auto
playing videos will be blocked I'm not
going to list them here but it all makes
sense
basically videos with no sound will be
allowed and videos with sound will only
be allowed if you frequently visit a
site and choose to play their videos
sounds pretty good to me Xiaomi known
for their smart phones and other
products has launched a gaming laptop
there's a 15.6 inch display a 7th gen
intel core i7 CPU and nvidia geforce gtx
1060 or gtx 1050 TI graphics the 1060
model costs 8999 u1r about 1400 USD it
looks fairly ok from the outside though
it's unlikely it will go on sale outside
of China at least for now final topic
for this week Foxconn has acquired
Belkin in a deal worth 866 million
dollars in cash Belkin also owns the
Linksys and Remo brand so all of those
products will now come under the control
of Foxconn an interesting move though
Foxconn does want to expand its
portfolio and the company said they will
increase the R&amp;amp;D budget for Belkin and
grow their product line that's it for
