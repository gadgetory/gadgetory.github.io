Intel Schaick 9k overclocking video to
hit YouTube and you guys really seemed
to like it I've since received a number
of requests to create an overclocking
guide based on my experiences with the
core i5 6400 so there's my last point of
business in 2015 I bring you the
hardware unbox skylake 9k overclocking
guide ads with the original video I'll
still be using the fatalities ad 170
gaming K 6 plus but this guide really
applies to any asrock said 170
motherboard including their most
affordable model the z170 pro 4s since
breaking the news of their sky OCT
technology the only other motherboard
manufacturer to make a similar
announcement is Biostar with what they
call their hyper OC technology at this
point there are only non official biases
for the select msi seuss and gigabyte
motherboards as these companies are yet
to make an official announcement it's
also important to note that you must
have the correct motherboard BIOS
installed to use this new overclocking
feature and now rock has conveniently
listed the supporting version for each
of their z170 motherboards on their
website in the case of the fatalities at
170 gaming k-6 plus we required the bios
version 1.9 3 to enable the non k
overclocking the bios can be downloaded
in one of three flavors for either a DOS
based flash a windows-based flash or the
instant flash the dos flash is the least
convenient option and typically we try
to avoid flashing the BIOS within
windows the asrock instant flash method
by the BIOS works rather well it's very
convenient and probably the safest
method and only requires a USB thumb
drive the first step is to download the
correct BIOS version from the asrock
website and copy it to a USB thumb drive
that's been formatted using the fat32
file system the buyers won't detect
thumb drives that have been formatted
using NTFS the bias is less than 10
megabytes in size so literally any size
thumb drive will do once the correct
bias has been copied make sure the thumb
drive is connected to a USB port on the
system your flashing and then restart
enter the BIOS on startup by pressing f2
or the Delete key by default the
fatalities at 170
in kx+ and most asrock said 170
motherboards for that matter load into
the easy mode setup you want to switch
to the advanced mode by pressing f6 and
then enter the next step is to navigate
to the tool menu and scroll down to the
instant flash utility if you receive the
error message no image file detected
that means a thumb drive is either not
formatted correctly or the BIOS simply
isn't on the drive alternatively we
suggest trying a different USB port
perhaps the USB 2 port rather than a USB
3 port for example if all goes well the
instant flash tool will detect the new
BIOS and the thumb drive and give you
the option to install it from this point
forward you want to sit back and do
nothing for a few minutes until the
process is complete it's imperative that
you do not reset the system or lose
power at this point as it will likely
result in your system becoming unusable
that said in the case of the fatalities
ded 170 gaming K 6 + there is a
secondary BIOS which you can switch over
to this will help avoid having to make
warranty claim the entire process takes
around 30 to 40 seconds but it can take
longer once complete the install flash
utility notified us of the success and
then reset the system
after a quick reboot we're now using the
new 1.93 BIOS and it's time to start
overclocking to confirm you are in fact
using the correct BIOS check the main
menu which lists the motherboard model
and bios version as well as the
processor tire speed and memory
configurations all the overclocking
action takes place in the OC Tweaker
menu first let's jump into the DRAM
configuration menu the first thing you
want to do here is load the XMP memory
profile I suggest loading the most
aggressive memory frequency setting
which in our case was XMP 2.0 profile 1
the ddr4 3000 if you load the memory
profile after making all the
overclocking adjustments it will reset
everything back to default
now the XMP profile has been loaded
manually set the DRAM frequency back
down to say 20 133 megahertz to allow
for some overclocking Headroom in our
case we can safely go as high as 3,000
megahertz without a compromising memory
stability next adjust the B CLK or base
clock frequency which by default is been
set to auto which translates to 100
megahertz previously I found
core i5 6400 sample could reach 160
megahertz for an operating frequency of
four point three two gigahertz a nice 60
percent overclock rather than jump to
160 megahertz we began overclocking in
10 mega heard increments and continued
doing so until we hit a limitation it
was then that we played around with
memory frequencies and CPU voltages to
try and continue on overclocking is
always done best in baby steps this
better helps you understand what the
limitations are and more importantly
what might be causing them with that
said begin by increasing the base clock
to 110 mega Hertz and this small step
will already add 270 megahertz to your
core i5 6400 operating frequency at the
110 mega Hertz base clock we find that
the ddr4 memory is jumped up from 20 133
megahertz to 2346 megahertz which is
still well within the operating
parameters now we're going to save and
exit the BIOS reboot the system and see
if it poses it should upon success weari
entered the BIOS and push the base clock
up to 120 megahertz which resulted in a
20 percent overclock for a cpu frequency
of 3.2 4 gigahertz and a memory speed of
25 59 megahertz this process was
repeated all the way up to a 150 mega
base clock at which point we needed to
reduce the memory frequency from 3199
megahertz
down to 3000 megahertz then finally at
160 megahertz the memory frequency again
needed to be reduced from thirty 200
megahertz back to 2987 megahertz for one
to eight ratio obviously if you only
have ddr4 2400 memory for example you
need to ensure that the memory frequency
stays below 24 hundred megahertz using
the 160 megahertz base clock with the
2987 megahertz memory speed the core i5
6400 with load windows 10 happily at
4.30 2 gigahertz without any voltage
adjustments that said stressful
applications would occasionally crashed
causing us to increase the V core
voltage to 1.3 5 volts at this voltage
the system was a hundred percent stable
and survived any stress test that we
threw at it for testing how stable and
overclocked is we recommend using prime
95 which allows you to run a torture
test that places 100 percent load on all
caused
if you just want to quickly check an
overclock run this test for ten minutes
and then to ensure and overclock is
stable run it for an hour given this as
a one point six two gigahertz overclock
we didn't feel the need to try and push
the core i5 6400 any further as we're
now receiving a tremendous amount of
extra performance from this sub $200
quad-core processor should you mess up
any bias settings along the way causing
the system to fail the boot test and
don't panic
most asrock motherboards such as the
fatalities at 170 game in k-6 plus
feature boot guard and you'll find other
brands offering similar features the
motherboard will detect when an
overclock has failed and reset the
system into the BIOS under a safe mode
type boot still should the overclocking
friendly safeguards foul you can always
clear the CMOS using either a jumper or
simply by removing the motherboards
battery once the mains power has been
disconnected we suggest you consult you
user manual to learn the best method for
resetting your own motherboards BIOS so
to recap make sure you have the correct
bias install for non cave overclocking
make sure you go up in small incremental
steps and keep an eye on the resulting
memory frequency getting our core i5
6400 up to 4 gigahertz was done very
easily without any additional voltage
once you start adding extra voltage the
thermal output will increase quite
dramatically and you'll want to ensure
you have a decent CPU cooler and
adequate case cooling to deal with that
extra heat for testing we use the $30.00
cooler master hyper 2 unto Evo so you
don't need to spend a lot of money to
achieve these over clocks on that note
please don't attempt to overclock using
the standard Intel Box cooler it simply
won't cope also for 24/7 usage we don't
suggest using much of a 1.3 5 volts as
this could shorten the life of your
processor as a final note this
overclocking guide not only applies to
the core i5 6400 but all skylight core
i5 core i3 Core i7 and even Pentium
processors the only variable to really
change will be the base clock CPU such
as the core i5 6600 which is a much
higher clock multiplier will likely be
limited to a lower base clock for
example to reach the same 4.2 gigahertz
overclock the 6600 will only require 130
megahertz base clock speed thanks for

overclocking guide as always if you have
any questions and please let us know in
the comment or in our forum a hardware
