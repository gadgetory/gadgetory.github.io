are finally covering GPU performance in
fortnight just give me a moment here ok
that's better
so yeah as I was saying we are doing a
bigger GPU performance comparison in
fortnight I feel like this video has
been delayed for ages now but in reality
it's really only been about a week but
what a long week it's been I had planned
to release the benchmark results this
time last week but then the meltdown and
spectra security flaws surfaced and I
pretty much got no sleep for almost a
week there so it's all a bit foggy
looking back there's still plenty more
to cover on that topic but for my own
sanity we're taking a break and checking
out a lazy 44 GPUs in fortnight
unfortunately though just as I wrapped
up all my testing all 44 GPUs done and
dusted NVIDIA emailed me and were like
hey guys we have a new driver that
improves performance in fortnight I took
a moment to calm myself and then I went
back to retest with the new 390 dot 65
driver I really do enjoy my job at the
top end I found around a 5% performance
boost though for the most part you
mid-range type GPUs they saw just a two
to three percent increase while the
bottom feed has got absolutely nothing
at all anyway I've now retested all the
NVIDIA GPUs with the latest driver and
this driver also addresses one of the
two spectra variants that the Nvidia
display drivers are vulnerable to and I
will look into the performance impacts
that these fixes have at a later date so
for tonight why am i testing this game
now you might ask well over a month ago
I started testing pub jina I decided to
run a poll in the channels community
section as well as Twitter asking you
guys which game you prefer pub G or
fortnight with a third option being well
neither of them 39% of you voted for pub
G and just 26% voted for fortnight while
a large 35% chunk said that well you
don't really care for either of them the
result on Twitter was slightly more even
but again overall
so much the same although pub G is the
more popular title I was still keen to
test the less demanding and better
optimized for tonight okay even if you
are in the minority I'm still looking
out for you plus it doesn't really hurt
that of the two games
I much prefer fortnight middle E I
haven't really spent a whole lot of time
playing either of them but on the
impression I've got from each title
fortnight seems like the one that I
would personally enjoy more for those of
you unaware fortnight did receive a
standalone battle royale mode late last
year it has been released on Windows Mac
OS PlayStation 4 and Xbox one for now
this is still an early access title as
developer Epic Games irons out the kinks
though when compared to pub G there
really appear to be almost none at least
based on my own experience the
free-to-play battle royale mode has
proven very popular and just two weeks
after its release had obtained over 10
million players obviously the battle
royale genre is extremely popular but
further helping is the fact that
fortnight appears to play very well on
just about anything and as I mentioned
it is free to play although it is very
well optimised there will be those of
you rocking older hardware looking to
upgrade to enable higher quality visuals
and this is where this benchmark video
will hopefully come in very handy for
testing I haven't decided to focus on
the higher quality settings rather than
the epic settings as I feel this is
where most of you using older hardware
or sort of low-end hardware will be
aiming to upgrade to the difference in
visual quality between high and epic
isn't that noticeable
while the drop in framerate is so I felt
for most the higher settings probably do
make the most sense something I'll just
touch on before we jump into the
benchmarking is the 3d resolution option
now this was set to epic it was the only
setting set to epic but setting it to
epic does ensure that you see 100
percent scaling with the selected
display resolution it's a bit confusing
but just setting the display resolution
doesn't mean the game will be rendered
at that resolution this just ensures
that the HUD will be rendered at the
selected resolution the actual game
resolution can be set from 480p 720p TP
or epic and that's where it's a bit
confusing the epic setting should really
just be called 100% scaling
would make it a lot less confusing for
gamers for the benchmark
I just dropped into the game at the
exact same location every time a busy
town and the moment I hit the ground I
just started running in the same
direction every time taking the same
path and that lasted for 60 seconds at
which point I recorded the result did
that three times and I'm presenting the
average of three runs so having said all
that let's jump into the benchmark
results let's start with the previous
generation GPUs that tell you p.m.
please note I'm skipping the Radeon
erics 400 series entirely as for the
most part the new 500 series is exactly
the same just a little factory
overclocking applied here and there the
rx 550 is the only truly new product
while the RX 560 has two extra CE use
enabled but overall isn't really that
much faster than an Rx 460 so if you
have a 400 series radeon GPU drop a few
percent off the 500 figures and that'll
put you within the ballpark for your GPU
okay so at 1080p use and the high
quality settings we find very playable
performance on almost all GPUs tested in
fact the Radeon r7 370 is the only
exception here and that will require you
to drop down to medium or possibly even
the low quality visuals for those of you
never wanting to drop below 60 fps and
based on my experience playing this game
staying above 60 FPS at all times makes
it significantly easier to aim so yes in
my opinion that would be desirable so
for this you will require a Radeon r9
390 or GTX 970 actually if we look at
those two GPUs for a moment we find yet
another game where the GTX 970 which is
now meant to be deader than Trump's
candy-colored head rug puts a real beat
down on the r9 390 of course the game is
built upon the Unreal Engine 4 and
typically we found that this game engine
does favour the green team but the point
is the GTX 970 is still going very
strong even in relation to other GeForce
graphics cards offering a whopping 24%
more frames than the r9 390 even the GTX
960 which has become a bit of a failure
and a number of recently released games
manages to beat the r9 380 and even the
380 X then we find the GTX 980 leaving
the fury X behind while the GTX 980
hey I needs the drawer decent set to
epic before I can even see how far
behind the fury axe is all right well
let's move on to 1440p and see how
things look there
here we find those wanting to keep the
framerate around 60 FPS as the minimum
will require a gtx 980 or a fury x
graphics card while the gtx 980ti and
maxwell titan x streak ahead delivering
over 80 FPS at all times
for an average of around 60 fps the GTX
970 or r9 nano will suffice
meanwhile the r9 390x and 390 weren't
too bad but beyond that you'll really
need to turn things down for better
frame rates then at 4k even the gtx
980ti struggles and although it was
still playable I did find around 40 FPS
it was really difficult to aim
accurately so again I would prefer
around 60 fps are playing this game now
it's time to check out the current
generation GPUs and there's a lot more
of them at tiny p the gtx 980ti titan x
GT x 1080 and 1072 eye are all CPU
limited to 150 FPS on average this isn't
a frame cap either frame rates would
shoot up well over 200 FPS when looking
at the sky for example for those
wondering the standard GPU test rig was
used to test the game and this packs a
core i7 87 ROK clocked at 5 gigahertz
with ddr4 3200 memory the good news here
being that for an average of 60 FPS
gamers only require a gtx 1050 TI or an
RX 570 the RX 570 also managed to keep
their minimum frame rate above 60 fps
and the 1050 TI was pretty close at 59
fps the drop down to the gtx 1050 wasn't
too bad but the RX 560 really struggled
to deliver playable performance as we
saw previously when comparing the gtx
970 and r9 390 nvidia has a commanding
lead in this title and we do see
numerous examples of this with the
current generation models as well take
the gtx 1066 gigabyte and i RX 580 for
example here the GeForce GPU was 26
percent faster hitting 112 FPS on
average and typically we would expect
these two GPUs to deliver a similar
level of performance then at 1440p the
margins are reduced but even so the gtx
1060 remained 20% faster than the RX 580
average of 60fps you will require an RX
580 but for this Tyler GTX 1063 gigabyte
is a much better value option as it
averaged 67 fps then we have the gtx
1070 which roughly matched Vega 64
liquid and the GTX 1080i was 46% faster
and actually in danger of being limited
by the CPU bang for your buck the GTX
1063 gigabyte is the standout here
though if you can afford it I would
suggest getting the six gigabyte model
for those of you wanting to play fort
not at 4k you will require a GTX 1082 I
have a perfectly smooth gameplay with
over 60 FPS at all times the GT X 1080
wasn't that bad but again you would have
to lower the quality settings as I found
it dips into the forties and that just
made aiming a little too difficult for
me as always I've thrown everything
together into a single big jumbled graph
so here we have all current and previous
generation GPUs and here we have the
1080p results feel free to pause here if
you want to study them a bit more
closely or you can also go to text spot
because there is a written version there
and the link will be in the video
description there moving on a 1440p
again if you want to study these numbers
a bit more closely then feel free to hit
the pause button I will just quickly
note though that here we can see the GTX
970 matching the RX 580 while the gtx
980ti makes an absolute mockery of vega
64 liquid finally the 4k numbers and as
they so often doing these big breakdowns
they make the GTX 10 ATT I look
extremely mighty I've decided to
continue the patreon bonus round which
we featured in the pub G video and I'll
be sticking with the models previously
proposed by our much-loved patrons this
is basically a super vintage bonus round
GPU such as the gtx 750ti the 760 the r9
280x the two 90 and the 290x they were
all heavily requested by a patreon
supporters so let's see how they handle
starting from the top we have the GTX
780 Ti which as we noted when testing
with pub G this card's kind of died off
a bit and some of the more recently
released titles but that wasn't the case
in pub G and it's certainly not the case
in fortnight either here it pushed out
an average of 101 FPS at 1080p using
these same higher quality settings
and this minute was just 10% slow on the
GTX 1060 the plain old GTX 780 also did
well matching the Radeon rx 580 the r9
290 was quite a bit slower matching the
r9 390 and the rx 570 then we have the
old GTX 680 which only matched the gtx
10:50 though this did make it slightly
faster than the r9 280x and the Radeon
HD 7970 gigahertz Edition the GTX 760
also snuck in there with those radeon
gpus so that was interesting to see the
HD 7950 roughly matched the RX 560 while
the gtx 660ti was for us to them both of
them then finally we have the gtx 750ti
which does do surprisingly well for what
it is it was interesting to see it
hanging in there with the old 500 series
flagship part the GTX 580 that
particular model uses considerably more
power so yeah very interesting to see
that again though as was the case with
all the entry-level GPUs you will want
to reduce the quality settings for
improved frame rates but still 41 fps on
average was decent and it was a nice
step up from the Radeon r7 370 well
there you have it a 44 GPU comparison
all tested under the same conditions in
fought and hot Battle Royale now this
should give those of you trying to work
out what GPU you need for a desired
framerate going into this we knew that
fortnight was a lot like other games
that use the cartoon style graphics such
as overwatch and Team Fortress for
example artistically the game looks
great but it's also pretty easy going on
the GPU still though if you want to play
at 1440p with higher quality settings or
perhaps even the epic settings you will
want something like a GTX 1060 or better
especially if you like me and you can't
aim worth a damn at less than 60 fps now
depending on how much demand there is I
might also do a CPU roundup for this
title so let me know if that's something
you're interested in you want to see it
so you drop that in the comment section
below
for now though that is going to do it
for the fortnight testing I'll revisit
the game later next month when we do get
those AMD desktop AP use that should be
very interesting indeed a fortnight is
the perfect game for testing such a
product also if you liked the video then
you know
please hit the like button for us we
really appreciate that and if you
appreciate the amount of time and work
that we put into these videos then
perhaps consider supporting us on
patreon and that will give you a direct
line of via discord to demand as many
benchmarks as you like I'm your host
Steve see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
