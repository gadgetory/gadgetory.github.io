yesterday we got our first official look
at how the GeForce r-tx 2080 TI and 2080
performed and I was quite impressed with
the 2080 ti what it offered at 4k but
ultimately was let down by the fact that
the nuturing GPUs cost way too much for
what they ultimately end up offering
that said ideally showcase a dozen games
in the day 1 review and although I had
the data for many more I didn't have the
time to discuss that many games given
the time that we had to produce that
content so it's day 2 now and I'm
hitting you with a mega 35 game
benchmark but before we get to the
results of this video has been sponsored
by deep cool planning on a high-end
build with a geforce r-tx graphics card
then you'll want a cpu call it a match
check out deep calls I catch and castle
all in one liquid cooler it looks so
good you'll think ray-tracing is enabled
the RGB lighting featured on the
waterblock and fans is addressable via
the supplied controller or alternatively
you can use your motherboards RGB header
the water blocks infinity mirror
provides stunning effects with almost
limitless color options it's sure to
take your builds looks to the next level
deep pools offering their castle cooler
and 240 and 280 millimeter versions
check them out via the link in the video
description ok so as I said on hand for
today's benchmark video we have 35
titles and in total 9 GPUs have been
tested at 3 resolutions in this video I
will be discussing the results for just
the 1440p and 4k resolutions for the
games that we didn't look at in
yesterday's video but I will provide all
the 1080p results in graph form over on
our patreon page for free so check the
link in the video description
if you want to see all that also if
you'd like to recommend games for
testing or discuss any of the results or
methods use then consider signing up to
our patreon account you will gain access
to our discord chat and monthly live
streams and you can do that for as
little as one dollar a month so it's
pretty great value though we will be
adding ray-tracing soon and charging
considerably more so getting Wireless
cheap just kidding that was of course a
lame joke as usual I'm using our Corsair
GPU test system inside the crystal
series 570 X
packing the core i7 87 okay with an
all-court overclock a five-year Hertz
with 32 gigabytes of vengence ddr4 3400
memory for the AMD GPUs I've used the
Radeon adrenaline 18.9 point one driver
and for the NVIDIA Pascal GeForce
graphics cards we have the 399 24 driver
while the new GeForce r-tx 20 series
GPUs will be using driver version for
11.50 one kick starting this mega
benchmark session is Monster Hunter
World and testing has been conducted
using the highest quality preset here we
set the r-tx 28 he was able to edge
ahead of the 1080i by a small margin and
that means it was 40% faster than the
1080 so a decent performance increase
there we also see the 20 atti way out in
front though truth be told at 1440p it
is just 26 percent faster than the
standard 20 80 and 31% fast in the 1080i
it is able to expand upon this lead at
4k now beating the 1080i by a 39% margin
but more crucially than that is able to
deliver playable performance I do
realize that people claim around 30 FPS
is playable but boy is the input lag
horrendous if you want to try it out for
yourself just set your display to 30
Hertz it's bloody awful and certainly
not the experienced someone who just
spent $800 us on our 2080 is looking for
moving on we have dirt for and for those
unfamiliar with this title the preferred
anti-aliasing method is CMAA
it works incredibly well for the Radeon
rx Vega GPUs for example Vegas 64 is
able to match the r-tx 2080 in this
title at 1440p but don't expect to see
that too often in fact you aren't gonna
see that again in the batch of games
that we're testing with in this video
the 2080 doesn't improve upon the today
you see is average framerate performance
though we do see a rather massive 32
percent improvement in frame time
performance oddly the 2080 TI's frame
time performance isn't much better than
that of the vanilla 2080 though the
average frame rate is 18% higher that
said it moving to 4k allows the 2080 TI
to stretch its legs and the new flagship
part is now up to 29% fast in the 2080
and 37% faster than the TI the 2080 was
also able to leave the 1080 way behind
in its settling dust
next up we have Assassin's Creed origins
and here the 2082 I looked to be CPU
limited as it was only slightly faster
than the 2080
which was only slightly faster than the
1080i which was a reasonable margin
ahead of the 1080 bump the resolution up
to 4k though and we start to see some
separation the r-tx 2080 is only 6%
faster than the TTI for the average
frame rate but 15% faster we're looking
at the frame time result it was also 36%
faster than the 1080 that said the 2080
ti it was less impressive beating the
TTI by just a 28 percent margin so a
pretty lackluster result here for the
new performance King Kingdom Come
deliverance as a total that needs as
much GPU horsepower as you can possibly
throw at it as you can see here at 1440p
the 2080 TI is required to keep the 1%
low figure above 60 FPS for the frame
time performance the TI model was 30%
faster than the standard 2080 and 32%
faster when comparing the average frame
rate so pretty impressive stuff there
for the 20 80 TI that said at 4k while
still playable those dips down to 38 fps
were at times notice so even the 20 80
TI it wasn't flawless here for silky
smooth frame rates you will need to drop
the quality of preset down a notch
imagine buying a GTX 20 80 TI to play
fortnight but you know there will be a
heap of gamers that have and don't get
me wrong I do quite enjoy fortnight but
with competitive settings I'll run on a
dirty rotten potato here we are using
the ultra quality preset or rather the
epic quality preset as it's better known
in the game for over 100 FPS at all
times the 2080 or 1080 - I will do the
job nicely but if you want to stay above
144 FPS or there abouts for those using
144 Hertz monitor it's not you have to
stay by 444 Hertz but alright I'm
getting off topic but anyway if you want
a lot of frames per second then you
might as well get a 2080 TI and middle e
at 4k using the highest quality visuals
even for that looks pretty crisp and
with over 60 FPS at all times it played
incredibly well on the 2080 TI the
standard 2080 also matched the tazie i
and both delivered a pretty smooth
gaming experience oh and for those of
you hope in SE pub
in this big benchmark video I have had
to drop that title I spent 20 minutes
trying to get into a game two days in a
row in fact and I couldn't do so so I
don't know what's going on there is the
game just completely dead now
very strange anyway without the ability
to get into a game I couldn't test it so
I've had to drop it I just couldn't
afford to waste any more time trying to
get into a game and of course I would
have to get Noah game multiple times to
benchmark a range of cards and anyway
fortnight's ten times better am i right
moving on f1 fans brace yourself as I
have tested with both the 2017 and new
2018 version of the game first that we
have the 2017 results of 1440p but with
both games I will be using the Albert
Park circuit here in Melbourne under the
same conditions at 1440p the game was
already very playable on a gtx 1080i and
by very playable I mean unbelievably
smooth with virtually no perceivable
input lag even for the Sebastian
Vettel's of the virtual f1 world and
jumping up to 4k did slow things down a
bit as you'd no doubt expect another
1080i and 2080 are keeping things above
60 FPS at all times
obviously that's still a great result
and while faster the 20 ATT I only
delivered a little over 20% more
performance of course almost 100 FPS at
4k is mind-blowing stuff but I was
hoping to see bigger gains moving to the
newer f1 2018 and again we said the 2080
delivers 1080 to our light performance
still the 1440p results are impressive
for both GPUs the 2080 TI was again a
little over 20% faster so well very
strong in terms of performance doesn't
exactly justify the 70% price increase
over the 1080i the 4k results are a
little better another 2080 TI is 30%
faster than the 1080i again doesn't
justify the price increase but 91 fps in
this modern racing title at 4k is very
nice that said there is an issue here
the frame time performance looks a
little cattywampus this isn't a mistake
I did triple check these results and
even tried the AIB
models and I've still got the exact same
result every time so this has to be a
driver bug these are of course early
drivers so I expect an Nvidia will get
on top of this issue before too long I
had also plan to test Forza horizon for
just the demo of the game but it kept
crashing on the r-tx cards so again
probably a driver issue which is a shame
as it would have been a great game to
test out a much older game that I'm sure
many of you are still very keen to see
how these r-tx GPUs performing is The
Witcher 3 Wild Hunt the 2080 again
provides 1080i light performance we see
the same frame time result with a slight
boost to the average frame rate the 2080
ti enables slightly better frame time
performance at 1440p with a 30% boost
for the average frame rate over the GTX
1082 I then increasing the resolution of
4k helps the 2080 to extend its lead
after 37 percent while the plain old
2080 is seen to be 38% faster than the
1080 so not a bad result there in our
previous video so the day one coverage
we showed shadow of the Tomb Raider
performance so if you missed that video
I recommend going back and checking it
out because there are an additional 12
games that we aren't going to discuss in
this video anyway since we already
covered shadow of the Tomb Raider we
won't talk about those results again
here but I will include them in the
performance breakdown at the end of the
video this time we're going to look at
results that we didn't previously
discuss in a rise of the Tomb Raider
using the DirectX 11 API at 1440p the
results are unimpressive the 20/80 is
slower than the TI while the 2080 TI is
only a fraction faster therefore it's
quickly moved to the 4k results and see
if the 2082 I can pull anything out of
the bag here it was still just 25%
faster than 1080i and I suppose that
alone is a decent performance increase
but again it doesn't come anywhere near
close to justifying the price increase
the same is true when comparing the non
TI models of the 2080 and 1080 the new
model was less than 30% faster moving on
we have Deus Ex mankind divided another
very GPU demanding title and here the
2080 does offer a nice little
performance bump over the 1080 Ti while
the 2080 Ti is the only GPU to keep
rates above 100 FPS at all times even at
4k the 2082 I still ensures the
framerate stay above 60 fps at all times
and with an average of 82 fps the game I
ran a silky smooth it really did deliver
an amazing experience
meanwhile the 2080 was again slightly
fast in the change here I'm making at
44% faster than the standard 1080 Total
War saga thrones of Britannia isn't
exactly the most cutting-edge title that
we're testing with but it does do an
excellent job of utilizing the twenty
ATT I even at 1440p that said while it
does put in a strong showing compared to
a lot of the 1440p results we've seen it
was still just 29% faster and we see
that the 2080 also beat the 1080 by a
similar margin interestingly at 4k the
2080 ti slightly extended sallied but
the opposite is true for the 2080
which sees the 1080 close in on it
overall not amazing results here given
the price tags but the 2080 TI is able
to deliver play performance while the
rest of the field struggles next up we
have Warhammer 2 and here the 2080
basically mirrors the 1080 ice
performance something that we're getting
quite used to seeing at this point also
as usual the 2080 Ti is seen well out in
the front there having said that it
wasn't quite 30% faster so let's move on
to see if it fares any better at the 4k
resolution nope
not really here it's exactly 30% faster
than the 1080i which is obviously a huge
increase but it's again not exactly
aligned with the current 70% increase in
asking price still if you want to play
Warhammer 2 at 4k and all of its glory
then there really is no better choice
personally though I probably just lower
the quality preset a notch and save
enough money to go on a short holiday
maxed out for honor isn't the most
taxing title and we see that both the
1080i and 2080 are able to maintain over
100 FPS at all times when testing at
1440p using the extreme preset still a
30% performance uplift for the 2080 over
the tourney will be welcomed by those
with higher refresh rate monitors but I
guess you did already have the 1080i
offering that kind of performance so the
2080
the ads no real value here of course at
4k we see much the same the 2080 isn't
able to beat the 1080i while the 2080
see I was just 28% faster so a somewhat
disappointing gain but having said that
a 3 FPS on average at 4k using the
extreme preset really is a thing of
beauty now if you're wondering why we're
testing with a game called war thunder
it's because this is one of the most
heavily requested games that always
comes up when we do these big benchmark
videos I've personally never played it
but it seems like a lot of you guys do
so here in the 1440p results it seems
like we're limited to just shy of one
hundred and 60 FPS at this resolution
using the highest quality preset called
movie so not much to discuss you let's
move on to the 4k results okay so now
we're seeing a good amount of separation
the twenty eighty is of course matching
the 1080i as we have seen time and time
again making it 35 percent faster than
the 1080 the twenty ATT I was just 26
percent faster than the 1080i but with
frame rates never dipping below 100 FPS
the experience was pretty amazing
albeit there are only a fraction better
than what was possible with the 1080i
moving right along the next game we have
to check out is Sniper Elite for using
the DirectX 12 API with async compute
nailed the GTX todai-ji was already
quite nimble at 1440p in this title and
we said the twenty eighty roughly
matches its performance while the twenty
eighty eight was only twenty four
percent faster then as usual we see the
margin slightly extended at 4k and now
the twenty eighty is 30% faster than the
1080i
meanwhile the twenty eighty is 35
percent faster than the 30 so decent
gains but not the 40 to 50 percent
Nvidia were promising the twenty ATT I
pushed over 100 FPS on average and
Middle Earth shadow of war at 1440p and
that's really a stellar result despite
only beating the ti by a 31% margin it
does seem so strange to constantly be
referring to 30% gains as only or just
but you have to do that when you're
talking about such a massive increase in
price moving to 4k does help the 20 atti
further distance itself from the 1080i
here it's 40% faster and again
while an awesome performance boost we're
talking about an almost break-even
scenario here in terms of the MSRP s so
it obviously is even worse than that
when we take the current retail prices
into account anyway moving right along
we have quake champions and this is
another title that isn't the most
demanding like what we saw with for
tonight but again those that play this
game a kind of nut jobs a bit like those
csgo players they require hundreds of
frames a second and I'm of course joking
about the nut job part input lag is a
real thing and Tim did explain it really
well in a video not that long ago so if
you want to know about that go look for
that video
anyway if just shy have 200 FPS on
average isn't cutting it for you at
1440p then perhaps the 20 atti pushing
over 220 FPS will suffice
the 185 FPS 1% lower results certainly
is impressive when you're strafing
around the map and doing all that rocket
jumping and stuff that quake players
like to do of course if you plan on
playing at 4k than the 20 atti
does prove more useful as it's the only
GPU capable of keeping framerate above
100 FPS at all times that said it was
also less than 30 percent faster than
the gtx 1080i so still a pretty tough
sell then then of course we see the 2080
only and matching the 1080i as we've
seen time and time again prey has always
been a well optimized title so pushing
over 100 FPS with this game max out
1440p was never really an issue for the
GTX 1080i the 20 ATT I did push the
average framerate 27% higher but I
suspect we're starting to become CPU
limited at this point as the frame time
performance wasn't greatly improved
increasing the resolution of 4k really
helps the 2082 I pull ahead and now it's
almost 40% faster than the 1080i and the
experience was noticeably better for
those with high refresh rate monitors
the 2080 is again kind of in no-man's
land it's unable to better the 1080i so
it's really difficult at this point to
understand the point of this product
next on our benchmark list we have Star
Wars Battlefront 2 and here the 2080
just managed to outpace the 1080i when
looking at the average frame rate
despite that the 2082 I was still just
27 percent faster than that's an 82 I
the margin does greatly improve it 4k
and you can see why own video
hand-picked this title a showcase the
GeForce r-tx Series performance in their
review guide oh and of course they chose
to do so at the 4k resolution even the
2080
is clearly faster than the today GTR in
this title albeit by a 7% margin but we
haven't really seen much of that however
it's the 41% performance lead enjoyed by
the 28 ETA over the 1080i that caught
our attention playing battlefront 2 at
4k using the ultra quality settings and
never seeing frame rates drop below 60
fps is something to behold man did it
look good okay so here we have another
viewer requested benchmark for a while
now I've been getting constant requests
to benchmark warframe and I have done so
once or twice but I found it quite
difficult to test the game in sort of a
challenging section that really
represents more demanding gameplay I
apparently have to play for quite a few
hours many hours in fact you have to
reach the Cetus I believe that's how you
pronounce it but correct feel free to
correct me if I'm wrong but you have to
get to this section of the game as it is
quite demanding and this is where I was
told to test one of the viewers who was
regularly demanding this test ended up
becoming a patreon member so that he
could play with me more directly to test
warframe and he even offered to help out
that was greatly appreciated I handed
over my account and he got me to where I
needed to be in order to test the game
more accurately so a big THANK YOU to
Thanatos on our discord server for
getting my account up to speed
hopefully you enjoy the results mate as
you can see at 1440p the 20/80 is 30%
faster than attorney and the 28th ETI
well that was just 15% faster than the
1080 TI so let's move on to check out
the 4k results we see a bit more
separation at the 4k resolution but even
so the 2080 TI is just 23% faster than
the TI
while the 2080 was 31% faster than the
1080 not particularly great results for
these new GeForce r-tx graphics cards
and I wonder if we'll see further driver
development improve performance in this
title though I doubt it will be a focus
for in video
Ghost Recon wildlands provided us with
some rare results the 2080 managed to
beat the today co by double-digit
numbers though only just it was 10
percent for Hastur on average
meanwhile the 20 atti was 16% fast in
the 2080 so not a great result for the
churring flagship GPU interestingly the
move to 4k did squash the 2080s lead
over the TTI
and now they're basically delivering the
same performance which is what we've
seen quite a bit of the 20 ATT I was
able to extend its lead they're only out
to 24% which was quite disappointing
despite the fact that gameplay was
noticeably better as we near the end of
this mega benchmark session we have
World of Tanks another lightweight title
that's always heavily requested I'm not
sure if you actually require over 180
FPS on average to maximize your skills
in World of Tanks but if you do please
let me know in the comment section below
in any case the 1080i edge to the 2080
out while the 2080 ti it was just 22%
faster on average the margin was
extended to 25% at 4k and this did allow
the 2080 TI to average well over 100 FPS
which is quite impressive meanwhile we
see that the 1080 - I again edged out
the 2080 and we're going to wrap testing
up with a rack fest for the first few
months of this game's release Pascal
kind of sucked in this title before
Nvidia eventually corrected that with
updated drivers it looks like we might
see a similar situation with cheering as
it's not just the 1440p results that are
massively underwhelming there admittedly
we do seem to be running into a system
bottleneck and please note we are
testing the most demanding section of
the game we could find at times when
just racing around not that many cars
the frame rates were much higher so
please be aware of that at 4k we see
basically the same performance out of
the 20 atti when compared to the 1440p
results just seen that being the case
it's now 26% faster than the 2080 but
only 13% fast in the TI so some
optimization work to be done here then
the 2080 also only matched the 1080 so
that's a very disappointing result
okay so there's 23 more games that we
didn't look at NAR day one coverage but
it is worth noting that the Dozen games
shown in yesterday's video were selected
to give an accurate picture of how the
GeForce 20 series compares to the
GeForce 10 series
views across a broad range of games so
the average performance margins won't
change by that much just a single
percent here and there so we already
know how the 1080i and 2080 TI can pair
but let's get a clearer picture of where
the gains are coming from and where
they're not as you can see across the 35
games tested the 2080 TI is on average
23% fast and the TTI at 1440p in
yesterday's video i showcased the big
wins in Rainbow six siege and
Wolfenstein 2 but here we see the 28
Ichi I was also a weapon in Kingdom Come
deliverance and Deus Ex mankind divided
that said we see some pretty poor games
in titles such as Grand Theft Auto 5 war
thunder ARMA 3 rec fest rise of the Tomb
Raider hitman and quake champions for
example some of this is down to this
system a CPU bottleneck for example but
some of it is also likely down to
drivers and it's possible in video we'll
be able to improve things from this
point we can minimize system bottlenecks
and make these games more GPU bound by
testing at the 4k resolution and doing
so extends the 2080 TI's lead over the
t2i app to 30% of course we do see
examples of 50% games in Rainbow six
siege of Wolfenstein - that's truly
remarkable and I wish we saw more of
that now looking at the RT X 2080 we see
when compared to the tej GI it was just
one percent faster an average at 1440p
the only noteworthy wins were seen in
Rainbow six siege and Wolfenstein 2
while it was slower by a 5 percent
margin or greater in hitman rise of the
Tomb Raider and project has to the
margin remains the same at 4k and the
performance trends are also much the
same sir overall the 2080 is offering 10
ATT I like performance when compared to
the GTX 1080 the new r-tx 2080 it was
29% faster on average at 1440p which
isn't bad and slightly better than the
23 percent gain in the 2080 ti provided
over the 1080 TI then finally at 4k the
2080 offered 33% more performance which
is certainly a very respectable game but
of course as we saw in the previous
video it really comes down to how they
stack up in terms of cost per frame the
following section of the video is pretty
much just a direct repeat of what was
discussed in yesterday's video I was
going to skip this for this video
but then for anyone who missed the day
line coverage I feel like this is really
important information so I felt like it
should just be included again so let's
just go over that information one more
time okay so we're going to actually
make a few cost per frame comparisons
based on the 4k results just seen first
let's look strictly at AIB MSRP s that
is the suggested retail price for videos
bored pups like MSI gigabyte and a soos
for example added to the model names on
the graphs axis are the MSRP s so $1,000
u.s. for the r-tx 2080 TI for example
this means the 20 80 TI comes at a cost
of 10 dollars and seventy five cents per
frame based on the performance just seen
that figure alone means nothing but when
compared to the 10 80 TI it means you're
paying a nine percent premium for the
new flagship GPU so although the MSRP
has increased by 43% given the
additional performance you're only
paying 9% more but of course that's not
really how we should look at this given
that Pascal is now a two-year old
architecture but I will discuss that
more later the RT X 2080 comes in at a
cost of nine dollars and 58 cents per
frame and that makes it just four
percent more costly than the GTX ten
eighty and three percent cheaper than
the GTX today you see I
so that actually seems pretty good and
by all accounts it is I mean it's not
exactly great progress as you're
effectively paying GTX 1080i money for
gtx 980ti performance and well we've had
that for like a year and a half now and
it's worth noting but the situation gets
much worse if we pricing the founders
edition models the 28 EF e costs as much
as an AI be 28 e TI per frame and then
the $1,200 u.s. 28 e TI comes in at a
staggering twelve dollars and ninety
cents per frame 31 percent more than the
1080 TI
but yet again it gets even worse than
that because you're forced to pay the FE
premium on all geforce 20 series cards
so that being the case let's take a look
at the current market prices this is
what you can currently expect to pay for
an RT X 20 80 and 20 80 TI and it's
pretty brutal the 20 80 comes in at a
cost of $11.50 per frame making it
valued than Vegas 64 and 20% more costly
than a gtx 980ti
again for the same performance the 2080
TI is basically a break-even scenario
it's about 30% faster than the gtx 1080i
and it costs about 35 percent more per
frame of course you will want to be able
to use all and extra performance as it
costs almost 80% more upfront before
wrapping all this up I wanted to touch
on the game selection and why some
reviews may show different margins to
others prior to the release of my day 1
coverage I had already compared cheering
to Pascal in 35 games so I knew which 12
to pick in order to provide an accurate
representation of how they compare over
a large spread of games and here are the
games that were picked to do just that
as you can see depending on the game is
used for testing the results can differ
quite a bit but overall we see that the
2080 ti was 30% faster on average at 4k
but what if I'd picked a dozen different
games to represent the 2080 ti like the
12th best results for example well now
we see a situation where the 28th eta is
41% fast and the TI on average and that
is exactly what companies like envía do
when they provide benchmarks so many
people were convinced that the 20 80 TI
was going to be 50% faster across the
board because of all the benchmark data
provided by Nvidia misleading benchmark
data I might add of course we could also
mislead viewers in the other direction
if we had it out for NVIDIA and handpick
a dozen of the worst examples doing so
would see the 20 80 TI delivered just
21% more performance on average
obviously this isn't something we would
deliberately do since we strive to
provide the most accurate and detailed
reviews possible this is merely an
example of how the results can be skewed
so this is why we like to test with a
massive spread of games it also gives
you a good idea of the gains you may or
may not see in titles you actually plan
on playing if you're big into
Wolfenstein Rainbow six siege
battlefront 2 and other titles where the
cheering GPU is absolutely killed it
then they will offer you more value but
if you're a rec fest nut enjoy playing
project cars - or primarily play any of
the games towards the bottom of the
graph then
provide even less value than what our
average suggests okay so I'm not going
to merely just rehash my conclusion from
yesterday's video I rather I would like
to expand upon it so again it probably
makes sense to go watch that video first
if you haven't already done so but in
summary the r-tx 2080 makes no sense at
all right now
as it stands it's an utterly pointless
product and it's all because of the
price even assuming a best-case scenario
where it sells at the $700 US MSRP a
price you may never see by the way it
still doesn't appear to offer anything
new in terms of regular gaming
performance I suppose that's what we
have to call it now non rate racing is
just regular gaming we've had this level
of performance for a year and a half now
from the GTX 1080i at this point it's
looking very much like the r-tx 2080 ti
it will be the only 20 series model
worth purchasing unless we see a massive
price correction or technologies like DL
SS become widely supported and work very
well at the moment seen can benchmarks
which tell you nothing so just hold out
till we get some actual performance in
real games or at least games that aren't
just showing canned benchmarks at this
point though we know very little about
it in regards to how it works and all
that sort of stuff Tim we'll be digging
into this soon hopefully he also has
some games to dig in with but right now
I wouldn't purchase an RT X graphics
card in the hope that DL SS will be
amazing now I said the 2080 TI is the
only 20 series model worth purchasing
and I didn't exactly say that because
it's good value I'm not actually even
recommending you buy it it's just that
out of the two options we have currently
it's the only one that I would entertain
buying I suppose having said that though
I wouldn't actually buy it I would just
get a GTX today GI and compromise on
visual quality settings at the 4k
resolution just dial things back a bit
and you'll get the sort of performance
you'll see on the 20 80 TI that said if
you've got bottomless pockets or like
Paul from Paul's hardware puts it and
money keeps falling out of your but
anyway I like Paul from Paul so I
thought that was quite funny but yeah if
you don't want to compromise on your
gaming experience and you want the
absolute
the BES and you're evidently willing to
pay whatever it takes then the 20 atti
does offer a pretty unique gaming
experience it is quite incredible what
it can do a before k resolution so I
guess what I'm trying to say is the
gamble that ray-tracing and DL SS end up
being worthwhile features for this
generation is less of an issue for the
2080 ti we already know that you're
receiving never seen before 4k
performance out of a single graphics
card so at least there's that getting
back to the non TI version of the 2080
why would you pay a 20% premium for GT X
1080 iolite performance that one is a
bit beyond me and will be interesting to
see how many gamers do I know they've
been snapped up quite a bit under
pre-order I don't know how many people
will be cancelling a pre-order and just
getting a cheaper 1080i or how much
sales will slow now that the hype is
kind of well it should have died off
anyway so yeah interests see if that
forces Nvidia down to the actual MSRP
due to slow sales but if gamers continue
to snap them up at alarming rates then
well we're all doomed also next month
the RT x 2070 will be released and that
one is coming in at well $600 US for the
founders edition model so if this
release is anything to go by that
probably means all cards are going to
sell for more like six hundred and
twenty to six hundred and fifty US and
I'm expecting GT X 1080 light
performance maybe maybe a little bit
better overall but I can't imagine it's
going to be too much better than that so
you're probably going to be looking at a
similar experience to what we're getting
now for 470 u.s. now we're fairly
certain stuff like rate racing isn't
going to be a very good probably a
complete bust on the 2070 if I'm
perfectly honest and it's hard to say
how well the LSS will work since we
don't actually know how well DLS s works
period by the time the 2070 is released
next month we may we'll probably
actually I was going to say we might
know but I think we'll probably still be
in the dark as to how these features
really do work so probably another
gamble there I mean just by looking at
the games list and I talked about this
in yesterday's video the games that are
advertised to support either rate racing
or DL SS are already looking to be quite
thin not that not great support Nvidia
probably could have done better a bit
more organization on that one but yeah
the game list isn't impressive so I
think it really won't end up being worth
the gamble assuming this is the case and
I'm right about this
the GeForce 20 series at its current
pricing is a complete bust
though you could argue that it is
regardless and then it's sort of like
why would you buy the 2070 because
presumably that's going to be just as
poor value and the same will be true for
the 2060 and so on
they're just big fat Pascal GPUs the
cost an arm and a leg so yeah if you
haven't gathered already it really is
all about the pricing the AIB MSRP S for
these nuturing GPUs is the absolute
maximum you should even entertain paying
for one of these new GeForce 20 series
graphics cards and that is assuming that
the technologies that I've been waffling
on about end up being the bee's knees
if we ignore ray tracing and DL SS for
the moment which we probably Auto given
they are still unknown quantities at
this point that leaves us with raw
gaming performance stuff we just looked
at power consumptions a little better
but overall much the same and the same
can be said for overclocking there's
really no Headroom there so the GeForce
GTX 1080 Ti has been doing its thing for
a year and a half now and the 1080 has
been around for a little over two years
so that being the case it is hard to
justify the existence of these new parts
the 2080 ti
really needs to cost no more than 800 us
and then the 2080
I'd say 600 us is probably the most you
want to be paying for one of those at
those prices they would be pretty
exciting products and worth buying in my
opinion sure that though I would just
sit this generation out in any case just
don't pre-order it's not a smart idea
for now ray tracing looks to be more
hype than anything and Nvidia are using
this to hide the fact that they don't
actually have anything new to sell at
least just yet anyway the real
performance gains will come when they
move to the seven animator process next
year so I don't see the GeForce 20
series having a particularly long
lifespan are certainly nothing like what
we saw with
skel nvidia simply isn't going to accept
giving up the performance crown AMD and
i expect that is exactly what they will
be doing with the GeForce 20 series next
year that is of course if they don't act
and push out seven animated GPUs as soon
as possible
so the GeForce 20 series looks to be a
bit of a money grab in my opinion a
stopgap to seven nanometers if you will
I think the plan is to cash in it now on
the RT x hype and then deliver the real
goods next year after all the RT x name
change is designed to make you think
that your pascal gtx 1080i gtx 1080 and
gtx 1070 are now heavily outdated so
give gamers the opinion they've got to
dump that GTX dinosaur and get in on the
RT X action and I think this is why in
videos pushing the RT X xx atti out the
gate right away rather than waiting a
year like they did with the GT X 1080 Ti
and they simply aren't in a position
where they can juice the series over a
two-year period in fact in my opinion
they don't even have an entire year
so rather than milk it over a 24 month
period the plan is to ravish gamers
wallets from day one I still believe all
that to be true with the exception of
the seven nanometer part since making
that video news has surfaced that
chewing was originally intended to be
fabricated on a 10 nm a process from
Samsung but because of delays there they
were forced back to TSMC s 12 nanometer
process this means next year it's
possible in video will refresh cheering
on Samsung's at nanometer process an
extension of their ten nanometer node
with a reduction in transistor size if
this is true that it would seem AMD has
received priority on TSM sees seven
nanometer process somehow forcing Envia
to look elsewhere seems unlikely to me
that in video would look elsewhere if
they weren't forced to it'll be
interesting to see how this plays out as
Samsung has never fabricated such a
large chip the biggest thing they ever
made on their 14 nanometer process was
150 millimeter squared so that's a
little bit bigger than the GP 107 die
use by the GTX 1050 Ti so paying a big
premium for a product that's probably
gonna have the lifespan of a mayfly I
won't be the wisest investment you'll
ever make
anyway as we usually do here at harbor
unbox we will continue to monitor the
situation and provide updates where
necessary as I mentioned earlier Tim is
going to be
all over ray-tracing and DL SS like a
mayfly on LG I on the other hand will be
checking out a few board partner cards
then sticking my feet up for 5 seconds
before tearing apart a heap of zed 390
boards to test variables and a few other
things along those lines and then it'll
be time to see how the new core I nine
or Arya a new core oh nine ninety nine
hundred k processor performs this guy's
been sitting on my desk for well pretty
much all week now so I'm keen to
benchmark it but I won't be till the
middle of next month that will release
those results I haven't signed an NDA or
anything but we will respect other media
outlets like gamers Nexus do when they
get things ahead of time and you'll see
our review go up the same second
everyone else's does and with that I am
going to end this one it's been a long
long week and it isn't over yet like I
said we've got to get those board
partner cards so I have the big MSI card
that looks pretty fantastic and it
actually is because I've already got
some good numbers for that one so to get
a review of that out gigabyte has sent
over some nice-looking cards as well so
I'll be checking those out and yeah then
I'll take that quick break before diving
into the Zed 390 boards tim's turn will
be coming up very shortly he'll be
providing all that content overclocking
so I'm looking forward to seeing that
