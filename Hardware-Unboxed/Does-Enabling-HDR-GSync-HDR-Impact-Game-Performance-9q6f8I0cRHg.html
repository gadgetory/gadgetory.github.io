today's video is a simple one and a bit
of a follow-up to my review of the asou
rog swift PG 27 you queued that we
published a couple of days ago that
video is pretty long as it is but there
was one thing I decided to cut out for
time reasons and that's the performance
impact of playing games in the HDR mode
compared to the standard SDR mode now
you might be thinking surely there is no
performance impact option to play an HDR
compared to SDA after all you're
basically playing at the same quality
settings with the same textures the same
character and object models same shadows
and so forth but the reality is that
switching on HDR and specifically HDR
which g-sync does impact your framerate
in certain games and that's something
we'll be exploring in this video a
couple of notes before we show the
benchmarks all testing was done on my
personal rig which includes a risin 7
1700 X overclocked 3.9 gigahertz 32 gig
of ddr4 3000 memory and an NVIDIA
GeForce Titan X Pascal which if you
might recall is around the level of a
GTX 10 atti
the monitor I'm using is of course the
asou speech in UQ which is a 4k 144
Hertz 10 bit HDR panel with g-sync HDR
support however for most of this
analysis I used the monitor at 98 Hertz
to avoid chroma subsampling though I'll
show you the impact of subsampling later
all games were played at 4k with ultra
quality settings the only two
differences being whether the HDR toggle
was enabled or disabled in the game and
when the g-sync was enabled or disabled
the other thing to note is this
performance analysis only applies to
gsync HDR at this point our plan
revisiting the topic when I get my hands
on a freezing to monitor to see whether
AMD GPUs impacted particularly when more
games come out with free sync to a
special HDR processing pipeline but for
now we're just testing with an NVIDIA
GPU and the current best HDR display on
the market let's get into the benchmarks
starting with Star Wars Battlefront 2
which has an OK HDR implementation but
it's definitely not the best I've seen
you'll see here there are three
configurations we've tested it the
standard SDR mode with chasing enabled
HDR
with juicing disabled and then finally
both HDR and gsync enabled as I
mentioned earlier we're testing at 4k
Ultra settings with the monitors set to
98 Hertz and connecting over DisplayPort
the first thing you'll notice is all
three modes delivered different
performance for the best mode in terms
of performance is the SDR mode and just
in case you are wondering there is no
difference in performance between g-sync
on or off in the SDR mode in this game
or any other game I tested with then
switching to the HDR mode with juicing
off reduces performance by 4% in average
frame rates but the big hit comes when
you enable both HDR and gsync it's here
that frame rates are 13% lower than the
SDR mode on average and 11% lower in 1%
lows the results of embell front you are
painting a rather interesting picture
about HDR and specifically g-sync 8g up
let's do some further testing hitman has
the oldest HDR implementation of any
game i'm testing with and in this game
the impact from HDR is a lot lower
while HDR does reduce performance by
around 3 to 4 percent there is no
significant difference between g-sync on
or off in the HDR mode assassin's creed
origins performs more simply to
battlefront 2 in terms of the impact HDR
has on performance merely enabling HDR
cuts down performance by six percent but
enabling HDR and gsync sees frame rates
hit by 11 percent tree sinker is having
a surprisingly large impact considering
it has no impact when running the game
in the SDR mode fire cry 5 is the only
game I tested where there is no
appreciable performance difference
between the HDR and SDR modes far cry 5
has in my opinion the best HD our
implementation available in a game today
and it also supports aim DS racing -
technology perhaps this game is using a
different newer HDR implementation that
does not result in a performance it it's
really hard to say at this point Middle
Earth shadow of war does not have a
built-in HDR switch instead it relies on
your windows HDR and WCG setting to
determine whether to use HDR or not this
game is impacted by HDR processing in
that you get a 5 percent performance
heat from simply enabling HDR while
g-sync HDR takes a huge 14 percent hit
the final game i tested was battlefield
one in its a similar story here enabling
age
results in a 4% hit to frame rates and
that jumps up to 11% when g-sync is
added into the mix it's no surprise that
these results are nearly identical to
Star Wars Battlefront 2 because both
battlefield 1 and battlefront 2 use the
same frostbite engine and for those
wondering whether 4 to 2 chroma
subsampling impacts performance on the
PG 27 YouTube when you bump up their
refresh rate to 144 Hertz you'll be glad
to hear it does not hurt performance
whatsoever here the Star Wars
Battlefront 2 results and the results
with juicy HDR and chroma subsampling
are essentially identical to the results
without subsampling enabled this set of
benchmarks is an interesting one we have
four games that are noticeably impacted
by chasing HDR and HDR in general
battlefield 1 battlefront 2 Assassin's
Creed origins and shadow of war all four
impacted in roughly the same way with
HDR reducing frame rates by
approximately 4% and gsync HDR reducing
performance by 12% both compared to SDR
but then there's far cry 5 which shows
no performance impact and hitman which
is slightly impacted by hjr but g-sync
appears to make a little difference with
these sorts of results you can't simply
say that enabling HDR or g-sync HDR will
impact performance in every situation
appears to be a case where some engines
need to do a significant amount of extra
processing to support HDR such as the
frostbite engine which results in a
performance hit while others use a
different HDR technique but doesn't
impact performance as significantly gets
doing there are many differences already
between game engines this varied
approach to HDR with the very
performance heat sounds fairly typical
the more interesting situation here is
when you add g-sync into the mix
alongside HDR the performance hit in
some games is substantial a game like
shadow of war in its HDR mode sees a 10%
performance penalty from simply an
abling g-sync and that's definitely not
an ideal situation you can sort of
stomach that performance hit from just
enabling HDR's there is a visual quality
improvement as we know most other
settings and improved visual quality
impact performance but it's
disappointing that enabling g-sync as
well which has zero performance in SDR
games also hits frame rates in some
titles do you think I guess it does
improve smoothness and the overall
experience so for a lot of
it's gonna be worth that performance in
particular at 4k but I don't think
enabling adaptive sync should come at
such a high cost it seems that for some
games at least the driver needs to do a
fair bit of heavy lifting to package up
both adaptive sync and HDR metadata into
the display signal so that the g-sync
HDR module on the display side can
process it with minimal latency with
g-sync disabled the module is
effectively bypassed so less PC side
packaging and processing is required for
the HDR signal and then for some games
the HDR pipeline is designed such that
far less driver side work needs to be
done at least that's what this data
seems to be indicating while it's not
good to see hgr or juicing compact
performance in some games the results in
far cry 5 are promising in this title
there was no impact when switching on
HDR or g-sync and the ACA implementation
is visually excellent so there's a
chance that other upcoming games will be
able to implement HD in a similar way
after all we are only in the early
stages of HDR support on PC so it could
take a few iterations to work these
sorts of things out that's it for this
short look at HDR game performance if

so it's definitely worth signing up I've
got to go test some more monitors now so
I'll definitely see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
