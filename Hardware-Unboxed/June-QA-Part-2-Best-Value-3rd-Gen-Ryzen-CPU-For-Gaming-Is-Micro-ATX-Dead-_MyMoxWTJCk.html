two of the June QA
and once again my my mate Tim he's out
of action still sick so just me and
we're gonna burn through a few questions
here we actually have quite a lot of
questions here this is going to be a
patreon exclusive not exclusive to watch
just patreon questions from our patreon
discord so if if you want to ask
questions there you can sign up I think
it's about 12 for the discord access but
you can jump over the page and have a
look at the tiers there anyway I'm gonna
try not waffle on a lot during this one
and see how efficiently I can get
through these questions so I'm not too
good at this so wish me luck I suppose
okay the first one here is from reg
Maxwell is M ATX dying so is micro ATX
dying I don't think so
there are a few Z 390 micro ATX
motherboards and said 390 some a premium
Intel platform so I don't think they're
dying and although there are only about
I think it's for Zed 390 micro ATX
boards there were only about 4s at 170
boards so over those generations things
haven't changed too much there and there
really aren't a lot of mini ITX boards
either but I think Mini ITX is probably
sort of if you're going for a small
form-factor PC people generally
gravitate towards mini ITX because you
don't really get that much more with
micro ATX boards and things like
crossfire and SLI aren't particularly
popular anymore so yeah you might as
well get a truly small computer if
you're going for a small computer
otherwise of course there's standard ATX
which is called standard ATX because
it's the more standard form factor and
then as for AMD well obviously I believe
this question has arise because there
are very few AMD micro ATX motherboards
and that's just purely because in the
past
AMD hasn't moved the kind of volumes
Intel has but now that AMD motherboards
moving more or they're seeing more AMD
motherboard sales and they were
previously especially relative to Intel
I think we will start to see more AMD
micro ATX motherboards so valve is only
1 X 5
an example that's from us as rock but I
think we will see some more so yeah
somebody keep an eye on but I don't
think it's necessarily dying it just
hasn't been hugely popular at any point
in time at least as far as I'm aware
okay next question here is from trogir
holic so it seems the main spotlight was
on Xen 2 /x 570 which are you more
excited for there's n 2 CPUs or the X
570 motherboards well then - definitely
on that one the X 570 boards certainly
do look nice and there's a huge amount
of them but I'm much more excited for
the Zen 2 processors because that's
really where that's really where all the
performance and all the excitement comes
from and you can use them just as well
on while we think you can use them just
as well on B 450 X 470 motherboards I'm
probably most excited for the Rison 5
series the 3600 the 3600 X and I'm
really keen to see how maybe the 3600
works on B 450 boards that should be an
ultimate value combo I'm gonna go back
to showing my phone sideways they just
wave to small these these images of the
questions so brain says now rise on 3000
supports PCI you four regardless of
people's current components and how
worthwhile it may be to upgrade do you
think it's the perfect time if people
are considering it now that we have ddr4
PCIe for nvme and so basically he's
asking for people who have been holding
off do you think that the rise in 3000
series is now a big enough incentive
that you get so many platform features P
so you for being the the newest of those
and I think if you've been stuck on ivy
bridge-e
Sandy Bridge or even Haswell and I skip
the AMD FX series here because if you
haven't upgraded yet well you'll
probably stick anything here but I think
for those people who are on those older
Intel platforms I believes into is
probably what you've been holding out
for I can't why I have to bench market
and check but it looks like yeah there's
going to be a lot of a lot of extra
performance there and many new platform
features that will warrant the upgrade
next one's from tough the go
just sort of random production question
but when you're doing a show floor stuff
like Computex
do you film a full audio track on-site
and then just rerecord it so without the
background noise or do you write up a
quick script after you edit all the
footage together good question that one
we've found for us the most
time-consuming approach delivers the
best quality for you guys so that means
we film just the intro and the outro for
the video at the booth because it's just
very difficult to film at the booth full
stop and then as you've noticed the
audio quality is not great then we
gather all the necessary information a
crap ton of b-roll then we go back to
the hotel room or wherever we're staying
we write a script so it's all quite
quite well scripted hopefully or it
flows rather nicely then we record it
and then lay in the b-roll and yeah
that's how we put them together it's
about I don't know 20 times longer
I'm just plucking a number it's
significantly longer to do it that way
than just to grab the mic and wing it on
the showroom floor but I think at the
end of the day the result is much better
we don't miss any information we get to
spend more time getting higher-quality
b-roll and I think just the end
presentation is a lot better you guys
seem to think so anyway so I suppose
that's the main thing okay next question
here is from M Solis and it's directed
at me and Tim obviously I'll handle this
one who have you met that combi Tex or
who do we meet at Computex I manage any
talks with GN or Linus etc unfortunately
we didn't catch up with Steve gamers
Nexus and the team we were going to
catch up with them on the last night go
to a sort of a youtuber get-together but
those guys pulled out because one of the
guys got sick so that's fair enough so
they were getting medication and whatnot
and taking care of him before the long
flight at home absolutely terrible time
to get sick so ya feel for those guys
having to deal with that I think Steve
himself sounded pretty sick towards the
end of Computex as well so that's
probably going around now with those
guys thankfully Tim and I mostly avoided
it though I got sick when we got back
just one of those things that happens
when you travel I did meet on that night
we caught up with Carl from bit wit
that's always a lot of fun and his wife
wife wife II I was gonna say wifey his
wife Heather she's very nice we caught
up with
if the guys from hardware canucks always
great seeing them early from optimum
tech got to meet him briefly so that was
nice we sort of come up with everyone
quite briefly because it was yeah just
going around there were so many people
to talk to Wendell from level one text
was there and cut wrist from an antique
was there Who am I forgetting there was
there was a lot of people there
obviously we had Jared from Jared's tech
there so there was a lot of people there
it was really cool like I said we didn't
really get to talk to anyone for too
long it's really actually Luke from
Linus tech tips was there as well it was
very layout in there and there was just
a whole lot of us and yes it was hard to
talk to anyone for too long but that
same day we did meet up with Luke again
for quite a long time I don't know how
many hours we ended up spending with
Luke but it was like four or five so we
caught up with him for lunch and then we
went for a walk and we got chatting and
yeah it was first time I've ever met
Luke super nice guy very casual timid I
had a lot of fun just chatting with him
he seemed to enjoy the chat with us and
yeah it was a really good time so that's
one of the that's certainly the
highlight of Computex for us is meeting
the other guys in the industry and
having talks with them and catch ups and
whatnot so yeah that was that day with
Luke was yeah a real highlight for both
Tim and I okay next question is from
Megillah majulah sorry if we've ironed
out this this name the pronunciation of
your name before and I've got it wrong
yeah I'm terrible with names what can I
tell ya so I'll just read the question
actually I can do that
what are the chances that 16-lane video
cards that don't saturate the pcie 3.0
bus will be refactored to become PCIe
four times eight cards to free up lanes
for other things 4k video capture cards
10 Gigabit Ethernet MDOT 2 expansion
cards etc I'd say there's zero chance of
that happening with existing graphics
cards because they can't simply be
reworked to support the PCI 4.0 spec so
unless AMD or Nvidia update their
silicon to include PCIe a 4.0 support
that just isn't going to happen and then
most X 570 boards they only have a
single PCIe slot connected to the CPU
because the a.m. for Zen through CPUs
have 16 lanes so there isn't there's a
lot it's very complex wiring up these
slots and the further they are away from
the CPU the more difficult it is to
avoid interference with the signaling so
most X 570 boards have just a single
slot anyway so you can't split between
two slots on most of the boards some of
them you'll be able to but you only
Babbage out with narvi graphics cards
for now but it's the situation they have
anyway there's no chance that they're
going to rework existing graphics cards
in my opinion maverick a name I can
pronounce do you guys plan on doing a
ram speed test at various speeds with
the news into CPUs with either the
initial review or a more in-depth review
later on and then it gives an example of
a few memory speeds
yeah that's 100% something I will be
doing I expect pretty much all media to
look at this in some capacity will
probably briefly touch on it in the
review in fact I'm certain will briefly
touch on it in the review time
permitting gosh I hope we get more than
a day with these things anyway I would
like to briefly touch on the review but
there will absolutely be at least one
big in-depth follow-up video if not
multiple so yep definitely be doing that
next one is from M slice will be die
still be a thing for Eisen 3000 and X
570 or won't it matter anymore yeah
it'll probably still be a thing I know B
die production has now ended but it is
still the best DRM at the moment so I
imagine that will deliver the best
results how much of a difference or make
compared to your other steppings I don't
know we'll find out okay the next
question here is from you seek every
brand brags about the compatible ram
speeds on X 570 like 4500 do you think
it's going to be a X 570 thing or is it
based on actual memory controller and
the CPU alone what I mean is will be 450
/x 470 have some RAM overclocking
capabilities okay hmm
well I think for the really high memory
speeds you'll probably require a good
quality X 570 motherboard again
this is all guesswork guys I haven't
actually tested it yet I don't think
many or possibly any of the be 450
boards will be able to run at the really
high speeds like well over 4,000 again
I'm guessing that said Amy's kind of
already let the bag the bag the cat out
of the bag yeah I'll start again that
said I am DS already kind of let the cat
out of the bag on this one as it looks
like going above what is it I think it
was 37 33 I memory spec we don't really
test that I think they used to CL 17
memory anyway at about 37 33 around that
spec the Infinity fabric is at a
one-to-one ratio and therefore you get
optimal performance however going above
that the Infinity fabric and the memory
then change to a two to one ratio and
that really hurts latency so I think it
was DDR 438 66 right up to I think they
tested up to like 4400 that'll almost be
certainly slower than 37 33 for gaming
just because of the increased latency
when running at that two to one ratio so
yeah I don't think memory speeds gonna
be too much of an issue anyway for the B
450 boards because they'll probably do
37:33 I don't know again I'm guessing
these questions are hard to ahead sir
next question here is from Breaking
dimes did any motherboard a vendors at
Computex mention user replaceable
chipset fans on X 570 boards okay so no
one mentioned any specifics of
replaceable fans to us but MSI did
stress that the fans on their boards
will pretty well outlive the board's
usefulness so a huge amount of run time
when those on those fans again we're
just taking them at their word we don't
know how hard it is to replace these
things or obviously under warranty it
won't be an issue and they shouldn't
fail under warranty but things that can
fail often do so not sure on that one
we're also really not sure how much the
fans actually run we're getting
conflicting reports on how often the
fans spin up whether it's just when
you're using nvme drives in raid zero or
just even one nvme drive or what the
situation
is there so that's something we'll have
to look into test a few different
configurations few different boards to
see how aggressively these fans spin and
how often but for everything we're
hearing the fans don't spin too
aggressively and they don't spin too
often so longevity really shouldn't be
an issue but of course I'll get back to
you on that one shortly peter hamana 11
with intel creating the f-series cpus
without AI GPUs do you see future
motherboards moving the eye GPU back to
the chipset yeah no chance that one's
happening for multiple technical reasons
but basically chipset graphics would be
horrible much much much more horrible
than any kind of CPU graphics so they'd
basically be unworkable today so the
reason the f-series well the reason I
suspect again I haven't done a huge
amount of research into this and most of
it's speculation anyway but what makes
sense to me what I'm what I suspect is
that juda Intel's processor shortage and
their need for more competitively priced
processors they've decided to sell CPUs
that they would have otherwise just
deemed as defective and thrown out and
that is CPUs without working GPUs for
whatever reason that there's some part
of the GPU that's defective or maybe the
whole GPU block is defective in the
silicon they've decided now to shut that
off and sell it as an F skew without
integrated graphics rather than throwing
them out so they're maximizing profits
there and they're a bit more competitive
on those parts also what would suggest
to me that they're wanting to maximize
profits there and be a bit more
competitive with those parts rather than
solder them they've gone back to using
paste for some of those chips so I think
there's a stepping number you can look
up and find out what kind of thermal
interface material they're using but
yeah I think it's just an exercise to
save money and maximize profit I don't
expect we'll see any chipset GPU
solutions ever again next questions from
Shanna in the event that the new Rison 7
&amp;amp; 9 performs better in gaming over
overclocked 99 or okay what motherboards
are you guys intending to pair it with
would it be something like an x5 70 or s
master extreme MSI's x5 70 god-like
creation or something else
okay well I suppose for our test systems
we'll probably use a high-end board as
we've always done just to ensure maximum
performance and stability and all that
sort of stuff because we generally test
GPU performance with overclocked CPUs so
best that there's no funny business
there impacting results such as
throttling or whatnot so we would use a
high-end board probably one of the bores
you mentioned there because they seem to
be the three of the the best boards or
better boards that we'll be seeing from
the x5 70 series but I'm really hoping
that something like a the MSI B 450
tomahawk for example that works just as
well and that's something I'll be
looking into in my day one coverage okay
silent game asks with calories being an
actual player in cyberpunk 2077 do you
expect it to be a trend so that is
Hollywood movie stars in motion capture
suits and having their own character
could we get a Bruce Willis with hair I
honestly have no idea that's outside my
area of expertise
I really like Keanu Reeves think he's a
really cool guy and cyberpunk looks like
an awesome game I'm not sure making it a
trend spending big bucks on these actors
really enhances gameplay so I'm not sure
that's something we do want to see
having said that though maybe it is
something that it's worth doing for them
maybe they're seeing a significant
increase in game copies being sold than
they would have without Cannery of so
that's possibly hard to work out I don't
know I'm not a CD projects account at
though so I have no idea how well this
is gonna work out for them anyway I
think Gianna Roos is cool I think the
game looks really good beyond that I
haven't got much else to say on that one
okay next question here is from Brian
again this one is directed it may and
Tim but obviously I'll I'll speak for
Tim on this one since he's not here what
are the specs of your main editing /
work machines do use software or
hardware accelerated encoding in
applications such as Premiere Pro my
perception is having something like a 20
80 would yield the fastest results but
is that no longer the case with things
such as thread Ripper
okay I use the thread repair 29 at 50x
on the msi x3 99 creation 64 gigabytes
of ddr4 memory and a vega 56 graphics
card reason I use Vega 56 just because I
had one of those spare I'd have to use
doubles basically of any graphics cards
I have and I usually don't have too many
doubles had to Vega 56 one for testing
one for me works out quite nicely I edit
all my 4k footage without any problems
encoding is really fast
I do use GPU acceleration though because
it helps significantly doesn't really
matter what CPU have if you can utilize
the GPU as well that's just going to
speed things up as for Tim well he was
on Rison 7 and then he ended up copying
me and now he has a 2150 X with 64
gigabytes of RAM on the X 399 creation
except he's gone on one up to me and he
has GPU acceleration with an RT X 20
atti I think he games on that system as
well so yeah at 4k anyway but that's Tim
and my editing rings a sad or a sad have
you tried fooling around with intel's xt
you yet so that's our extreme tuning
utility yeah i've been using that for
quite some time now it's very useful and
it's a very well made tool by intel
you'll often find it featured in our
intel related content especially when we
do like erm testing on 390 motherboards
and stuff like that it might really cool
bit of software and if you are using
intel cpus or Intel platforms which
would be using Intel CPUs it's worth
checking out if you like tinkering
around with things and monitoring stuff
ok the next questions from reckful do
you guys think an msi be 450 gaming pro
carbon could hold a 3100 x without any
issues yeah it should be able to do it
pretty easily I would have thought and
the same goes for the 3900 X it's fair
to say if it can't basically no be 450
or X 470 boards will be able to and
certainly no 300 series boards will be
able to so yeah fingers crossed it all
works out quite nicely another question
here from Maverick wouldn't be possible
to add additional benchmarks for at
least the first in-depth review of
Verizon 3000 series in the form of
DaVinci Resolve and Vegas
in video rendering I'd really like to at
this point though I have to say no it's
looking almost impossible to include
what I'm trying to include at this point
and that's because this is probably
actually I think it's fair to say this
is the most difficult release I've ever
had to cover in my almost 20 years of
doing this job you'll know more soon
but yeah the seventh of the seventh is
it's gonna be a crazy time another
question here from Brian we're seeing
lots of mentions of erm in your and
other channels videos I read what it is
but what in your opinion is so important
about it to require such attention and
what do the phases and other key
operational components of it mean okay
so quick version I suppose so the
voltage regulation module it's important
because it will determine how well your
board supports current and future CPUs
it impacts things like stability quite
heavily it'll determine how hot the
board runs so what the vrm area of the
motherboard which is the main thing
maybe not with X 570 but it'll determine
things like thermal output of the
motherboard and especially how well it
handles overclocking so let's say you
bought a B 450 board that didn't handle
the Rison 720 700 X that well and that
was the case for quite a few of the
seuss and gigabyte models that we looked
at they around really hot with the 2700
X installed then something like a 3,800
X and in particular the 3900 X they're
really going to be right on the edge and
probably struggle even with
out-of-the-box performance I don't know
if we'll see throttling that's something
I'll look into but yeah those boards are
right on the edge are probably going to
struggle and then we have boards like
I've talked about it before the MSI B
forth a few tomahawk and carbon pro they
rival the best X 470 boards which is why
I bring them up a lot they're really
good value they have higher quality
verum components and they should be fine
and noticeably better than other B 450
boards but again we'll look into that
shortly for you okay question here from
Nick do you have any theories as to
weigh in AMD's p our slides for these n2
parts there is a performance improvement
in gaming going from 8 core parts or 12
core parts
I mean it's not like many games let
alone the older ones in a performance
improvement from adding it more cause
yeah that's quite interesting I am
seeing in some titles a strong
performance improvement when going from
six to eight cause I know that's not
what you're talking about here
but we'd say that 2700 over the 2600 X
the 1800 X over the 1600 X titles such
as Assassin's Creed Odyssey world was a
hit man - and I suppose to a lesser
extent battlefield 5 and show of the
Tomb Raider for most games though you
have absolutely right going from even
just six to eight cause sees very little
difference so from eight cores to 12
cores
yeah quite surprising there may be again
a title like Assassin's Creed Odyssey
that might see a performance improvement
I'd be surprised but maybe it will I
haven't yeah it's not something we've
really looked at with similar
architectures because it hasn't really
been possible supposed to the sky like X
but we haven't done much testing with
those parts again we don't know how the
Chipola design impacts performance you
would think it wouldn't be a positive
but again we know nothing really about
it at this point apart from what AMD's
told us so in the next few weeks you'll
know a lot more so I guess we'll just
have to wait till then another question
here from reckful again when you guys do
Zen - reviews we'll be running the 3600
to the 3800 X on B 450 boards would love
to see that for some reassurance yeah
100% do that that's something yeah I
definitely plan on doing next questions
from Shanna Steve do you have a 69 or K
/ 59 60 X in hand if so can you see how
they compare and fare in 2019 against
horizon sevens so I do have both those
CPUs in fact I well I've just finished
making a video with the 600 K and
that'll be on the channel tomorrow so
you'll see the 1800 X I'll put the 7700
K and they're just out of interest
against the $6 okay so yeah you can
expect an 1800 X 27 hundred and
thirty-eight hundred x battle against
the 600 k soon okay question here from
exatly Thor after I saw the video about
paid reviews I wonder if a company asks
you to take money to say only good
things
a product but you don't sign any kind of
contract can you screw them over like if
there isn't something official to prove
why they send you the money they can't
sue you right I'd say for that sort of
thing it would be payment upon delivery
like I said in the video we believe you
have to submit the content ahead of time
that's what it seemed like when we got a
bit more information and then it goes
through an approval process and after
that then you can publish the content
and then I suppose after that point at
some point you'd get paid yeah I don't
think that payment things that under the
table quite I think I think it's all
done quite officially it's just
sponsored content so and I like I said
most of the guys are declaring it as
sponsored content which I suppose is
fine I just don't like the idea of doing
reviews that have to be approved and you
can only say positive things about the
product and not highlight the negatives
that's just well it's a paid
advertisement obviously and I think it
really discredits anyone who does them
but yeah that's all I really want to say
on that one Jessica Steve would you
consider doing an FX 8350 versus core i5
a 3550 in 2019 comparison I'm yeah maybe
I'm not sure there's much demand to see
those two CPUs battle it out in 2019
technically I suppose it could be
interesting but I think with what we
have on our plate now it's probably not
something I'd get to for a while and
there's probably a long list of more
interesting comparisons so if I can make
that one happen I will but yeah and I
think it's gonna happen anytime soon
unfortunately okay next up Sal Kang and
Steve for QA yep that's why you put in
the Q&amp;amp;A section mate what do you think
the practical performance difference at
real-world settings for gaming will be
between Rison a five seven and nine
firstly sorry about the minor burn there
Sal I'm sure you recover Nick did ask a
similar question earlier on that I
addressed I feel for the most part there
won't really be any difference for
gaming especially as you sound a sort of
your more realistic
conditions higher quality settings
higher resolutions where you're mostly
GPU bound I think yeah I think there'll
be very little difference at all which
is why I think the rise in 5:30 600 is
going to be a hot item just a really
good value see CPU for gamers right now
but anyway well we'll find out shortly
jelly the saint has a nice short
question here for us I'll try and blast
through this as quick as I can
okay Steve according to popular opinion
you are now the benchmark God how's your
ascension to godhood given you any sort
of special powers like your ability to
one-shot trolls in a comment section I
was born with that gift is that one of
the powers you got if so did your
ascension come with any other real-life
powers like can you get your wife or
kids to listen to you for example or are
your powers mostly restricted to the
nerd realm very funny question that well
firstly I appreciate the love you guys
show for the benchmarks it makes all the
time and effort well worthwhile sadly
though yeah the title you guys have
awarded me well my my kids and my wife
my wife in particular don't recognize it
so yeah no special real-life powers to
speak of they certainly don't listen to
me so yeah it's just anyway
shanks asks do you think there will be
any performance differences in the stock
or overclocked using a 3000 series
horizon with be 350 board compared to
newer chipsets do you think there'll be
a notable difference between a how a mid
tier be 350 and a mid tier be 550
unreleased be 550 motherboard
overclocked with a 3000 series chip well
I can't really answer the be 550 thing
because we don't really know much about
them but yeah overclocked the lorem
boards will probably be more limited but
I think stock hopefully they won't be
aimed if kind of already said that out
of the box the performance should be
identical but we'll know more about that
soon as I've said quite a few times in
this video Nico's s what motherboard /
chipset will you recommend to someone
who wants to build a new PC with Rison
3000 CPU for example r5 3600 oh it's
interesting you mentioned the 3600
because that's the CPU I've been
heavily talking up in this video but
again it's impossible to say right now
I'm guessing that the r5 3600 will be a
good value CPU and I'm guessing it'll
work well with a decent B 450 board I
think that should be a killer combo that
is my guess
okay I think we'll wrap this up here
I've got one last question from trogir
holic Steve Tim with all the hard work
that this channel puts into benchmarks
of games application et cetera
Jeff ease the workflow by sending the
raw data to any friends supporters
freelancers to crunch the numbers make
graphics and organize everything in a
way that you can read it or is it all
done by you two if the latter which part
of the process is the most
time-consuming and would you ever
consider reaching out these processes to
ease up the workloads I suppose
outsourcing those things love the
content really looking forward towards
into coverage maybe even more so than
the product itself well firstly thank
you for all of that we don't outsource
anything because it's just it's actually
just more efficient and more accurate
for us to do ourselves I don't really
trust anyone else to do the benchmarking
for the stuff I do and then I trust him
to do his stuff so you know I like to do
the benchmarking it gives me sort of I
like the hands-on approach I definitely
don't want to outsource the data because
sometimes it's quite easy to make
mistakes in Excel and that messes things
up I mean on occasion I've I've made a
mistake but yeah I like to be
responsible for my own mistakes I
suppose it's pretty hard to get people
involved with this sort of stuff I think
possibly at some point if the channel
got big enough we could look at hiring a
full-time editor that would certainly
help but again they have to be really
familiar with all the ins and outs of of
the components and the benchmarks and
all the stuff we talked about
so yeah getting an editor's a
possibility don't think I'd ever hire
anyone else to do the benchmarking I
enjoy doing that myself yeah so that's
that really oh and sorry I almost forgot
just had to reread the comment again
quickly what part is the most
time-consuming depends on the content
we're making for the benchmark videos
absolutely the benchmarking phases
by far the most time-consuming part but
I also really enjoy it so it's one of
the more fun parts for me as weird as
that may sound but all the parts are
really time-consuming for a review like
for Zen - they'll be quite a few hours
spent getting b-roll quite a few out
many hours spent scripting stupid amount
of time spent benchmarking a lot of time
spent editing and getting it all
together so there's really you know
there's a lot of time-consuming aspects
of making the content that we make hey I
am starting to lose my voice a bit it's
one of those things where I haven't
fully recovered from that thing that I
caught on the way back from Computex if
I talk for too long my throat dries out
and it gets a bit bit uncomfortable I've
got a lot of lot of content I've got to
do over the next few weeks so I've got
to take it easy
but I think that was that was a lot of
questions we got through there so anyway
thank you for watching thank you to all
our patrons you invaluable to the
channel the lifeblood of the channel in
a way so thank you for all your
questions thank you for your support and
thank you to everyone else who watch
this video we appreciate all of you
anyway that is gonna do it for this one
sorry Tim couldn't be here he'll
definitely be here for next month's QA
whether he's sick or not and yeah that
that's it for this one thank you for
watching I'm your host Dave I'll see you
again next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
