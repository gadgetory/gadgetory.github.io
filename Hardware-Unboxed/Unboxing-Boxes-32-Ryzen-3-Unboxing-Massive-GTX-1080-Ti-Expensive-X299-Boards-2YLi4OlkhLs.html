episode of unboxing boxes cool that was
a fun episode what they have to say
Ryan Cooper seriously who looks forward
/ who gets excited about a video made
about something getting taken out of a
box I mean the numbers say otherwise and
I too have obviously clicked on this
video but within two minutes I came to
my sanity and thought why the fuck I
might have had to use 20 minutes of my
time to see some stuff talked about
whilst being taken out of boxes I'm a
little more biased towards your
informative tough animate video Steve I
must admit those are what drew me
towards your channel thumbs down on the
unboxing so me though
welcome back to harbor and box for
another episode of unboxing boxes now
Ryan is agreed to skip these videos from
now on and let us simpletons enjoy the
peeling back and ripping of the
cardboard and all of its unboxing glory
on a serious note though I did actually
attempt to stop this series a few months
ago and after a few weeks that an
episode many of you started to spam me
demanding I take some stuff out of boxes
and show you the action
so I guess long weave unboxing boxes for
this episode we have five boxes that
have been piling up this week in my
studio / benchmark lab / house that I
live in and yeah we're going to open
them up and see what treasures lie
within I should probably start with this
box
it's from AMD and I believe it has my
shining you rise and three samples
inside i've probably by now click baited
this video with something like rising
three unboxing and a heap of you who
don't normally watch the unboxing boxes
series of click the thumbnail that come
and see some shining your eyes and three
CPUs being unboxed and instead they've
been sitting there watching some
Australian sounding knucklehead talk
nothing but gibberish for like two
minutes without opening a single box and
despite nobody actually asking they're
probably heading to the comment section
now to type something along the lines of
the video starts at three minutes you're
welcome oh well thanks mate anyway we're
fine
yeah let's open this box if I get this
box open
and there aren't any rise and three
samples inside this intro we'll just get
a hell of a lot more confusing
interesting padding here check that out
in a minute
whew we do have summarized on three
samples two boxes there'll be much 500
of 1,300 X 1,300 X and 1,200 the UD well
not a whole lot the same at these you
guys probably saw my rise on three
simulated benchmark video yesterday and
yeah pretty much expect those numbers to
be spot-on what I don't know and I'm
really looking forward to exploring in
the review of things like overclocking
how well these just overclock and I
suspect it at the time they came with
the race stealth cooler and have a look
this is looking very racist elfish yes
indeed so do come with the smaller race
stealth cooler which is still a very
good cooler I haven't actually got my
hands on a race stealth before all the
lower end CPUs that AMD sent me didn't
come in the retail packaging so I just
got the CPU itself so no ah there it is
found it so I thought the r8 stealth had
a copper vapor chamber in the bottom of
it I don't know if this is a different
version or if I just have no idea what
I'm talking about which is highly likely
but anyway as you can see there is no
copper was wrecked the Tim here
yep that's aluminium the whole way
through so yeah don't know how well that
will perform but I don't expect the 1300
X and 1200 to put out a huge amount of
heat I'll just wipe my finger the
standard rate is pretty much twice the
height compared to the race stealth but
the race stealth fan is pretty much the
same I think it's maybe slightly larger
diameter actually they look they look
pretty much identical moving right along
so we have the CPUs themselves they just
look like a rising CPUs might drops and
b-roll of them but nothing terribly
exciting or different to what we've seen
very much the same as risin 5 and risin
7 but yeah so the only thing that we
don't know yet we have a pretty good
idea of performance as I said what isn't
yet known and AMD will probably only
release this information just before the
refugees go live probably just to make
our life a little bit difficult
they might not is the price so we are
guesstimating that the 1,300 X will come
in at 130 dollars u.s. and then the 1200
will come in at 110 dollars u.s. and if
that's true that's an awesome price for
that processor and that alarm pretty
much smoke everything from Intel from
pretty much the G 4560 R so that'll be
really cool if they come in that
competitive on price which it's rumored
that they will and then what have we got
here I know what this is all about
that's cool well okay I'm gonna have to
get changed I was going to troll you
guys this episode and where this
checkered shirt which I know
due to the YouTube compression looks
like a kind of weird mess on camera I
was going to make you sit here for
probably 30 minutes watching me move
around this thing and it looks really
weird but I'm going to go get changed
and put this on because this is
something I begged AMD to get for me and
they have
no I said train Mikola later so you guys
are probably sitting here going Steve
that is a super-sweet rising jacket how
did you get that and while it wasn't
easy let me tell you I went to the
upgrade Australia 5.0 event quite a few
months ago and my AMD contact was there
cool guy named Gareth and he had on a
risin hoodie looked pretty cool I
thought damn all the AMD fanboys would
be loving that on the channel so I said
to him you've got to get me one of those
and I'll wear it for an unboxing boxes
episode is like are they're pretty hard
to come by and you made all these
excuses and whatever as the night went
on I said look if you can get me a rise
in hoodie I'll wear it next for the next
generation Intel processors for my
review might undermine my review
slightly and make it look a little
biased but yeah I'm not going to do that
that's what I told him and he's trying
to hold me to that
so anyway when he was at he was overseas
recently goes well I haven't got the
hoodie but something better it's our new
rise and jacket and this is it so we
sent it with my samples fortunately I've
got to work on this make it a bit more
comfortable just not going to cooperate
so yeah
Rhys and jacket as you can see it's a
orange inside and yeah it's pretty cool
so thanks that Gareth I'll wear the rest
of this work for the rest of this
unboxing boxes episode so very AMD theme
to this one I'll get these alloy ok what
to go for next alright laughs move this
out of the way you guys keep telling me
to get a better knife but the struggle
is real and I enjoy it makes the
unboxing experience a little more
challenging
wouldn't be fun if it was easy what have
we got here
that's all I can see all right now it's
upside down
holy moly
okay I think whatever something pretty
good here their new GeForce GTX 1080 TI
lightning I believe lightnings a
graphics card for MSI this is their
fully Unleashed version of the 1080 TI
and the size of that box it's kind of
like the the Nvidia founders edition
style boxes where they slide off at the
top I think yes you ready you guys ready
for this okay that wasn't as exciting as
I thought would be the cards not really
presented that well that's still we've
been pretty underwhelming
let's forget about that okay so don't
fall over wowzers I picked up this thing
saw it at Computex and did a a video on
it and yeah I remember it being big at
Computex but now home in the studio it
seems even larger comically large really
Wow here they're 1080 I believe and like
quite wise it's quite similar but when
you get to the thickness it makes the
1080 look like a bit of a baby well the
first thing you notice right away is
that this thing always a tongue well
maybe not a ton but I believe it's
something like 1.7 G lows so more than a
one and a half kilos what a behemoth and
you can see well you can see the size of
that heatsink there what a beast and the
backplate also very beastly I've already
got my fingerprints all over it it's
actually got a copper heat pipe that
runs into end of the car
that sort of mental work well the idea
is the same as gigabyte with their
copper in civics that they say the
differences there's actually works and
then you've got a translucent plastic
strip here and that's all our G be lit
same with through here on the card so
and then you've got some sort of silvery
accents on the front of the card I
believe they can be replaced with other
colors like red and stuff yeah what an
absolute beast
and then you've got three three eight
pin power inputs sort of standard i/o
stuff here dual link DVI it looks like
you've got two display ports and two
HDMI but yeah well I can't wait to put
this on the test bed and see what sort
of temperatures that run that and how it
overclocked so I can't imagine it ever
clocks
any better than a sort of standard 1080
TI but all the limitations are supposed
to be removed so yeah might be pretty
impressive so in case you're wondering
the card is 320 millimeters long so yeah
you want to make sure you've got an
equally large case to fit this thing in
I'd imagine having two of them and then
out of the box I believe it comes
running at the what they call the gaming
mode spec so that's a base frequency of
1582 megahertz with a sort of based
boost GPU 3.0 brew speed of 1695 mega so
it's almost 1.7 gigahertz as a box and
of course as we know GPU boost 3.0 will
run higher than the advertised frequency
and there is a lightning mode that you
can hit up the flick of a button and
that'll take the boost to something like
17 hundred and twenty one megahertz so
some a mild boost but still it's another
26 ish megahertz or something I think it
is yeah so a big beasty graphics card
the only problem with this card which
you've probably guessed other than the
size and the fact that it'll put your
PCI Express slot under some serious
strain is the price so the MSRP for the
1080i is $700 u.s. though to be fair at
the moment GPU pricing is kind of messed
up expect that to be correct
very shortly ba the MSRP is $700 I think
for a card this crazy sort of up to
about $800 would probably probably be
reasonable at the moment it is on new
egg though I think it's out of stock
it's there for about 870 dollars u.s. so
yeah and it's 1500 Australian dollars so
mighty mighty expensive yeah keen to try
it out on of course few ideas I'm going
to do with this card so you'll see those
videos probably next week depending on
how much rise and three coverage I have
to do because there'll be a lot of
things there as well anyway that is very
cool very keen to play with that move on
to the next much smaller and lighter box
what do we have here this knife is so
useful now flat out cutting through
bloody tape I cut towards myself and
anything at sharp enough to cut me
anymore all right we made it we're in
this is cool well I'm actually unboxing
something that could end up in your
possession so what we have here is some
team group T Force Nighthawk RGB memory
well that's a they just keep getting
evidence of added RGB to the name it's
not just three more letters but yeah
everything that has RGB out now it's
like an entire paragraph just for the
product name anyway
pause oh yeah so we got that and then
we've got an SSD now I'm not reviewing
either of these but what I will be doing
with both of them is creating a build
that I'll be giving away on the channel
and there's a few more pieces to come
for that bill but it's going to be a
brand new build probably go with some
sort of Rison process or maybe arise in
five we'll have to work it out
yeah we building a pretty cool gaming
system and I'll be giving away on the
channel and I'm doing this with at least
two other channels and they're getting
the same hardware so we're building
three systems and we're doing a group
giveaway so
that will be really cool and hopefully
someone from one of my subscribers gets
one of the systems that would be cool so
first up we have the l5 light and it's
kind of bland cheapish kind of looking
design and packaging but I think maybe
that's the point because this is pretty
much the cheapest 240 gigabyte SSD on
Newegg when I checked it's only $80 us
for this particular model and it does
boast some fairly impressive
specifications on the back here it says
read speeds 513 megabytes per second
which is about as fast as you get with 6
gigabits per second SATA and 400
megabytes per second right so there's
certainly decent specifications for a
240 gigabyte SSD and something else
worth noting as it does come with a
three-year warranty so that's pretty
cool as well um yeah so cheap affordable
SSD and that will be perfect for the
build we're doing you'll get windows and
all the essentials certainly on a 240
gigabyte us to stay with a couple of
games as well but we'll probably go with
a secondary hard drive as well and as
for pricing in Australia there is none
it's not for sale in Australia moment at
least I couldn't find it so yeah moving
on we have the nighthawk RGB memory or
the T force DD T for ddr4 gaming
nighthawk RGB memory so yeah remember
that but this is I believe ddr4 3000 yes
that's correct it's 2 8 gigabyte sticks
up to 16 GB its L 16 timings or 1618
18:38 at one point three five volts yeah
this memory is definitely one of the
better-looking G because it's available
the modules themselves or the heat
spreaders on the modules are available
in black or it's like it a really dark
grey I think or white I'm not actually
sure what they've sent us looks like
white yeah probably the cool looking
ones of the 2 and will no doubt suit our
bill
they're quite weighty I'll throw up some
b-roll these guys in action the LEDs all
lit up they are they can be software
controls but they also work with the
soos aura lighting so that's pretty cool
and I believe there's something like
nine lighting effects in total at the
moment you're probably looking at the
default one they give off a really nice
cool effect so yeah some of the better
looking RGB memory on the market for
sure they are quite pricey though though
all ddr4 memory is pricey at the moment
this 16 gigabyte for example sells for
150 dollars u.s. yeah so moving on doing
pretty well so far we've got two rising
three processors some memory and SSD and
one graphics card that you could
probably shave down and make about 8
graphics cards out of and I've got a
sweet rising jacket doesn't get any
better or does it let's find out anyone
see actually this is something I
purchased and it looks like this box has
done some serious miles this is indeed
what I purchase so you guys probably
know I've been doing a lot of corex
skylake X testing and the 7800 X the six
core model skylake x64 model the gaming
performance was underwhelming to say the
least
the 7700 K pretty much smoked at most of
the tests came out being around 13%
faster overall that was 20 up to 30%
faster and some games absolutely
obliterated v6 core processor despite
the six core processor been clocked at
4.7 gigahertz which was only 200
megahertz lowerin at that point really
makes very little flash no difference
and quite a few well I shouldn't say
quite a few a couple of people or a bit
upset with the results and thought the
700x should have been faster we're
suggesting that it's the asrock
motherboard that is to blame and the as
rewards are no good underperforming or
whatever
Thomas Hardware did test the MSI asrock
and soos boards and found that the ads
report actually in games performed very
well anyway I have to as rock boards
they both give me the exact same now
there's so I thought you know I like to
make sure I'm giving you guys the right
benchmark numbers and I couldn't
actually get a sample of an extra 90
line board I think because of the heat
the platform is receiving manufacturers
aren't too keen to send out boards at
the moment of vrm overheating issues and
just the fact that it's been a
controversial platform to begin with
anyway I bought the suits prime X 299 a
supposed to be a pretty good board and
it was to be honest with you the reason
I bought it was because it was one of
the cheaper boards I didn't really want
to spend eight nine hundred dollars on X
to night on board and believe me in
Australia there's plenty of that price
this was one of the cheapest I could
find and it was still something like
four hundred and seventy dollars
ozzie so pretty cool looking board is
actually I had two more of those
Nighthawk modules they looked very cool
on this board this is quite funny here
we've got to sticker over the right bank
of DIMM slots that says for Intel Core X
series processors that's the four core
models install the dims to channel C and
channel D for dual channel
configurations the fact that
manufacturers have to put things like
this on their boards to explain why I
might not be posting for someone with a
certain CPU just sort of I guess goes to
show how broken this platform is or not
necessarily the wrong word confusing
rushed my hopeful hand out anyway moving
on we all know about that what to say
about this board it has three PCI
Express 16 time slots it has USB ports
sort of that couple of USB ports pretty
cool looks like an interesting m2
configuration ice to take it apart later
and work have a look at what's under
there but that is where the m-dot twos
are hiding got some more of this come on
you can do it so yeah for four hundred
and sixty dollars or the it's a pretty
basic looking board the heatsink over
the V RMS quite small you do get an
eight pin plus or four pin power input
so that
should be good should be good what else
have we got here other interesting
features is 8 SATA ports what else we've
got
crystal sound I'm not too familiar with
the Zeus products so I don't know what
codec that is it's probably something
real Tech by the looks of it though I
can't see for sure yeah some USB threes
type-c looks like a 3.1 we've also got a
3.1 had our USB 3.1 header on board and
that is a gen 2 so that should deliver
30 something what so that'll be good for
charging phones and stuff if you have a
front panel type-c connector on your
case a relatively new case anyway pretty
cool looking board really the only
reason I bought I'm not going to review
it or anything I don't think it I think
there's a great demand for use on X 299
boards at the moment yeah I just bought
to confirm the results I was seeing with
my asrock boards if he spits out the
same numbers then I'll be quite
confident that it's not a motherboard
issue or at least it's not a motherboard
issue that's only affecting the asrock
boards okay
word up to the last package we are
absolutely flying through this episode
alright that's quite funny
at least it has a record another hang-up
oh well we got here ah just foam nothing
just home another X 299 board except
this is the external gaming I 9 so
design for the 10 core model by the
sounds of it yeah 36 watts those type
see front USB headers deliver 36 watts
of power let's get straight into this
one
are you ready you ready there we go
fresh board that's a pretty cool looking
board that one small plastic to feel
pretty substantial looking vrm on this
model they obviously have those higher
and cora names in mind little heatsink
here and I believe that would be cooling
the 10 base Gigabit Ethernet science was
it 10 base T to invest - I think
probably that red port there which have
a high-end switching another PC with 10
base Network anyway and we do have three
ultra m2 ports so you better kicked up
some serious storage there go for some
Samsung 960 pros probably we have 10
SATA ports so you'll be able to hang a
fair bit of storage off there plus your
m2 s not sure how that goes if any of
them are shared they probably shouldn't
be on this platform with your 44 lanes
or whatever you've got
we've got Sound Blaster cinema 3 audio
looks like a pair of intel land wireless
I think it's dual band AC I think it's
802 got 11 AC Wi-Fi so that's kind of
cool though not sure how much you'll
need Wi-Fi if you've got all this wired
connectivity but anyway um what else
else very heavy board I believe it's got
some custom RGB wiring but it's just
under the heatsink here for the chipset
you've got your power on and reset
button there that's very handy Wi-Fi
they include those on the enthusiast
grade boards and then you've got four
PCI Express 16 time slots interestingly
despite the absolutely monstrous looking
VRM there is only a single 8 pin power
input so I'm not sure if that's going to
turn out to be an oversight by asrock or
not
the vrm itself it's a little bit insane
it's a 12 phase design 720 amps now they
said to be a hundred and thirty watts of
power delivery so yeah you shouldn't
have any problems overclocking their
variant throttle providing it has
sufficient cooling and this heatsink
looks pretty decent that's definitely
attached very firmly and screwed into
place so that should work pretty well
for those wondering this board cost
three hundred and ninety dollars u.s. so
it's not stupid considering the features
but it is pricey because that would work
out to be no less than five hundred
dollars Australian and I mean I paid
when was four 60-ish somewhere somewhere
between 460 and 480 for the seuss prime
board so I expect this will probably
come in a bit more than five hundred
dollars Australian might even be close
at all in six hundred dollars any was so
looking at what I was seeing there's
plenty of X 299 boards costing around
seven hundred dollars Australian I don't
think they have the kind of feature this
board has so it could be despite being
extremely expensive it could actually be
quite good value and I think that just
about does it for this board I'm keen to
plug it in and see how it performs I'll
tackle the asou sport first and see if
that matches up with what I've been
seeing with the Tai Chi and then I'll
plug this in and have a play around and
yeah we might overclock the eight core
CPU on this board and see what kind of
results we yes so a very successful
unboxing boxes episode I think we got
some pretty cool hardware here I know I
got the most expensive motherboard I've
bought in quite a long time I can't
remember the last time I've spent nearly
five hundred dollars Australian on just
a motherboard but yeah I've got plenty
of boards that are that expensive sent
to me over the years but yeah buying one
different sort of kettle of fish there
but anyway yeah talking over spending a
lot of money this is three times the
price of that board whether it's worth
or not I don't know but we'll find out
impressive looking nonetheless love the
look at this memory can't wait to fire
up you guys will have already seen what
it looks like
I've seen it in other people's videos
that was certainly impressive budge and
SSD and then we've got my rising three
see view which I'm very keen to
unplugging I've got a lot a lot of
testing ahead of me I'm going to have at
least three test systems going at a time
because I've got to test them
I want to test some older CPUs to
compare them as well but that might be a
follow up video after I do the day one
coverage Friday so that'll be tomorrow
we will have that big thirty game
benchmark comparing the six core 700x
with the quad core 77 okay against the
horizon 516 hundreds of the six core
model so that's going to be an awesome
comparison I can't wait to get that one
fully finished them online and yeah and
I got my rising jacket so that was a
huge win there thanks Gareth love it I
don't think I will review any Intel
processors while wearing this and I
think I'll probably review anything
while wearing it but but I do love it
it's been good to wear for this episode
of unboxing boxes and it's a very nice
quality awesome jacket so yeah won't
won't skew my opinion in any way but
it's still very cool so for those of you
that enjoy the unboxing box a series I
hope this was an episode that you did
indeed enjoy and I hope that Ryan Cooper
saw the notification and skip to this
one I have a video for you tomorrow Ryan
you'll enjoy it thoroughly I'm your host
