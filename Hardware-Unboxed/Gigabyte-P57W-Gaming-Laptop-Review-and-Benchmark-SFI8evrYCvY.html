I'm not the biggest fan of gaming
laptops in my opinion they're generally
too big too bulky performance is lacking
and they're usually all around poor
value as far as a gaming rig goes but
for those that really need one there's a
big difference between the good and the
bad options and I've got to say the
gigabyte P 57 W looks pretty damn good
on first impression taking it out of the
box I was immediately surprised and
impressed by how slim this laptop is
powerful gaming laptops are dealt with
in the past we're quite a bit bulkier
and while the P 57 w's thickness of 24.9
millimeters was comparatively thicker
than your regular
ultrabook it also seemed proportionate
to its 421 millimeter width and 290
millimeter depth even better was the
fact that this system only weighs a
total of 2.9 kilograms my next point
will probably be a dividing one I like
the fact that the P 57 W looks pretty
much like a normal laptop and there's
only a few small gaming accents the top
of the lid is simple and features only
the gigabyte logos small aerodynamic
looking lines at the base and a slight
point at the very front that might give
a slight suggestion of the fact that
there's gaming hardware inside popping
the lid open reveals a similarly subtle
interior with honestly only the slim
orange lines on either side of the base
white squares on the WASD keys and the
NVIDIA GTX sticker giving away the
laptops true identity lastly there's
some orange feature on the side of the
hinges to know I'm honestly a fan of the
look it's not over the top with LEDs
skulls or aliens and the keyboard is
only backlit and white no RGB is here
this gaming laptop would honestly sudor
maturer adult who didn't really want to
advertise the fact that they're carrying
around the gaming laptop for me the
absence of these features means it's
simple not tacky as so many other gaming
laptops can be so in summary if you're
looking for something to knock your mate
socks off with a wacky and jaw-dropping
appearance this might not be the laptop
for you having said all that the design
is all around plastic and doesn't give
what I call a premium feel but I think
the absence of aluminium and rubberized
surfaces has helped keep the cost
temperatures and weight down which
positives in my mind the base of the
unit is firm and doesn't give any flex
and the lid is relatively strong to for
a plastic cover to make any hardware
upgrades or adjustments you need to
remove the entire bottom cover of the
chassis there's two RAM slots which were
filled with to 8 gigabytes sticks of
ddr4 in my review unit as well as an m2
SSD slot and a two and a half inch drive
bay there's also a hot swappable bay at
the front of the laptop where you can
have an optical drive additional storage
or nothing for a slight weight reduction
the p50 7w is equipped with a full sized
backlit keyboard which has two lighting
levels that can be adjusted with the
function key and the space bar as
mentioned there's no RGB ease here
simple white backlighting the chiclet
style keys give a little bit of feedback
and features 30 key anti-ghost rollover
so you shouldn't have any input problems
there they're pretty quiet and the
travel distance is very short which can
be good or bad depending on your
preference the touch pad is nice and big
and works pretty well it doesn't feature
any physical buttons and instead the
entire thing is clickable there is a
slight click noise and there is feedback
when it's pressed and the essential to
finger scrolling works out of the box
overall I'd say the touchpad is good but
I think most gamers buying this laptop
will likely carry around a portable
Mouse anyway the P 57w features a 17.3
inch full HD IPS display that's honestly
one of the best I've seen on a laptop
seemingly 3k and 4k displays are getting
more and more popular but I think 1080p
is perfect for a gaming laptop like this
while 17.3 inches is monstrous for a
laptop it's not actually large for your
eyeballs many windows needs to be scaled
up in my opinion even Windows 10 is
pretty poor doing this consistently and
well across the board and the experience
can be frustrating at the least 1080p is
also perfect for gaming on this system
I'll come to performance later but you
can probably guess that it's not going
to be pumping out high quality graphics
settings and anything higher than 1080p
so running games that is true 1080p
resolution is optimal scaling down from
a higher res can look blurry and if you
want to avoid this and run at the full
res then you'd have to be prepared to
turn down a bunch of graphical settings
the coating on the screen is matte
meaning it's anti-glare performance is
good thanks to an excellent IPS panel
the display itself is awesome
IPS is fantastic for color contour
some viewing angle can be 178Â° to look
at your screen from the brightness is
great too and honestly I didn't notice
too much of a quality difference coming
from my dell 30 inch IPS panel apart
from the resolution and size obviously
unfortunately Nvidia's g-sync has not
supported the speakers on the laptop I
found at the front underneath the palm
rest
this means they perform best when the
laptops sitting on a flat solid surface
and sound as much what you'd expect it's
loud for a laptop and there isn't in the
face they're fine for the occasional
YouTube video or TV show when you're
desperate but a good set of headphones
to be much more suitable plus the whole
world doesn't want to hear you running
through the grass and darksouls anyway
taking a tour around the edges of the
laptop you'll find a wealth and variety
of inputs and outputs starting on the
left hand side you'll find the lock slot
Ethernet port and two USB 3 ports next
to these are just the SD card reader and
the mic and headphone ports swinging
around to the right-hand side we've got
a power port VGA output mini DisplayPort
HDMI 2.0 USB 3.1 type C and one more USB
3 port I thought it was great to see the
variety of display output types as well
as 3 USB 3 ports and the inclusion of
USB type-c finally it's time to get to
the good stuff let's check out the specs
and performance there's a full specs
list in the video description so I'll
just go over the important bits here
powering the gaming this bad boy is
invidious gtx 970m equipped with 3
gigabytes of vram and should be just
about perfect for pushing most of
today's games at 1080p the CPU and the
p50 7w is an absolute weapon for a
notebook it features intel skylake core
i7 6700 HQ processor boasting 4 cores
with hyper-threading with a base clock
of 2.6 gigahertz and a turbo boost speed
of three and a half yards you have
onboard an impressively powerful CPU for
all kinds of purposes and an almost
excessive amount of power for gaming as
mentioned there's two RAM slots allowing
a maximum of 32 gigabytes by two 16
gigabyte sticks the P 57 W comes
standard with 2 8 gigabyte ddr4 2133
sticks for a total of 16 gigabytes which
is plenty for just about anything you'll
likely be doing on this laptop
especially gaming storage wise the P 57
W comes standard with the 256 gigabyte
light on
M to PCIe SSD which should support
massive transfer speeds the secondary
drives of one terabyte 7200 rpm hard
drive aside from this there's wireless
AC Bluetooth and a 720p webcam
integrated now let's get to the really
interesting part how does this thing
perform I've run a few benchmarks and
some of the latest games give you guys
an idea of how it stacks up
unfortunately I don't have a lot of
gaming laptops to compare it to but you
can get a good idea by how performs
relative to our desktop GPU results all
tests will run of course at 1080p with
the maximum in-game quality settings
first up I three call of duty black ops
3 at this portable gaming machine and as
expected performance was basically
exactly on par with the GTX 960 averaged
over three tests like a 61 FPS on
average compared to 60 from the GTX 960
in my standard test system next up was
the quite demanding rise of the Tomb
Raider title and here again the
performance was very very similar to the
GTX 960 the p50 7w managed to produce 56
FPS on average with a minimum of 36 the
last game and the testing block is the
division where once again performance
was on par with the desktop gtx 960 here
the P 57 W is good for 35 FPS at max
settings with a minimum of 28 to test
the battery's overall performance I use
future max power Mac software this
automatically runs the system through an
intense combination of multi media
gaming simulation and general use such
as web browsing to see what kind of
battery performance you can expect at
the very least my P 57 W lasted 4 hours
and 11 minutes in this test I haven't
personally tested other gaming laptops
but my research around the web tells me
that this is a really good score
eclipsing the likes of Lenovo IdeaPad Y
700 and the Acer Aspire v15 nitro to run
the battery further through its paces I
charged it to full unplug the cord and
got stuck in an ark survival evolved to
see how long it would last I was playing
with the medium quality preset with
anti-aliasing dialed down from epic to
medium and getting around 45 FPS on
average the battery lasted here for one
hour 19 minutes so no surprises here if
you want a game you want to be plugged
in but it is still possible to eke out a
little playing time if you are desperate
it's winter here in Melbourne and
honestly the p57
w was a great little lap eater but of
course like all powerful laptops or any
laptop really a lot of heat comes out of
the bottom
this is aided by two rear facing vents
that allow the fans to pump heat out
there too though I found the fan spun
audibly at all times though there
definitely aren't intrusively loud give
you about smart managers software allows
you to control the fan speeds a little
with four different profiles but it
didn't bother messing with these much
the normal profile seemed to do the job
the power adapter and cable totals a
little over three meters long and it's
big but not ridiculously big and is
rated for 180 watts and you go into this
review and have to put my dislike of
gaming laptops aside now I was worried
it would be pretty tough to do so but
the p50 7w actually made it quite easy I
was perhaps most impressed by its form
factor when I read the specs I was
expecting a chunky mother of a system
but was pleasantly surprised at how thin
and light the overall chassis was then
opening up the lid the screen really
impressed me the 17.3 inch 1080p IPS
panel felt bigger than it actually was
and of course the IPS quality was better
than anything I'd seen on a laptop
before the keyboard and touchpad a fine
nothing mind-blowing but they do the job
the hardware inside the p50 7w is also
very impressive and very suitable for is
1080p panel the 6700 HQ CPU is almost
overpowered for this application and the
970 M is great for 1080p gaming too some
users might be disappointed by having
only two RAM slots however I think being
able to squeeze 32 gigabytes in there is
realistically plenty you held the
standard 16 gigabytes is plenty
lastly the little extras like the hot
swappable 2 and a half inch drive bay
and decent speakers make this a very
nice overall package the only thing I
really see as lacking was the exception
of invidious juicing support however I
can definitely forgive gigabyte here
based on the quality of the display
otherwise coming in at 16 99 USD or
available in Australia for around 2050
Australian dollars the p50 7w is fairly
priced well I still wouldn't ever
recommend a gaming laptop over a desktop
for anyone that doesn't truly need the
portability as far as they go the p50 7w
from gigabyte is an excellent option
