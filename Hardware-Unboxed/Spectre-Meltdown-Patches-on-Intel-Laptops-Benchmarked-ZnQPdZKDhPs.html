unboxed you've probably seen our
coverage over the past few weeks on the
meltdown and specter vulnerabilities
specifically the performance drops you
can expect from the patches that address
these issues Steve's been doing a great
job covering the desktop side of things
where we currently have a serious lack
of updates for anything outside the
newest hardware platforms today however
I'll be diving into the mobile side of
things to see how meltdown inspector
patches have affected ultra portable
laptops at this stage om is are much
more keen on patching laptops than they
are on patching desktop motherboards
especially the big-name manufacturers
like HP Dell and others this makes it
easier to test older hardware platforms
at least with the hardware I have on
hand so in this video I'll be looking at
the impact on both the latest 8th gen
Intel you serious parts along with
three-year-old 5th gen Broadwell parts
the laptops I'm using for testing are
both Dell XPS 13 so high-end ultra
portable systems with 15 watt CPUs
inside the new 190 360 model has an
Intel Core i7
8550 you inside with 8 gig of ram and a
256 gig samsung PM 961 a PCIe SSD the
older Broadwell 93 43 model comes with a
core i5 5200 you also a gig of ram and a
256 gig samsung PM 851 SATA SSD as with
desktops patching these laptops requires
two separate updates a BIOS update
specific to the device that tackles the
spectra vulnerabilities along with a
recent Windows Update that kills
meltdown and supports the spectre BIOS
patch I've tested both Dell XPS 13 in
two configurations before either update
was applied and after both updates were
applied this will give us a good idea of
how to performance differs between an
unpatched system and a fully protected
system I should note here that the
performance differences you'll see may
not apply to all laptops with this sort
of hardware inside but it should give a
good indication of
these patches effect a more performance
constraint system let's kick things off
here by looking at PC mark which is a
set of workloads designed to simulate
real-world tasks across the three PC
mark 8 tests and PC mark 10 there isn't
a significant impact in the meltdown
inspector patches with performance
declining by just a few percent in most
cases this is margin of error type stuff
and for most cases won't be a noticeable
difference in performance Cinebench r15
is an interesting one here as we do
start to see some performance
degradation the 8th gen platforms seem
to be more heavily affected here
dropping by 7% in the multi-threaded
workload and 3% in the single thread
workload Broadwell was still affected
but the difference was negligible in the
single area test and just 4% in
multi-threaded Cinebench isn't the only
rendering test that's been affected
while rendering x264 videos in a two
pass encode pass one performance dropped
on both kb lake refresh and Broadwell to
the tune of 8 and 4 percent respectively
the more intensive pass to where most of
the actual encoding occurs isn't
significantly slowed on the I 78550 you
but it does suffer a marginal decrease
on the i5 5200 you
interestingly rendering an x265 video in
handbrake with a single pass actually
improves the performance marginally
after the update particularly on
Broadwell where the render time is cut
by 5% so it's not necessarily every
rendering workload that is affected by
the patches the final video rendering
test I have is premier which is affected
by the specter and meltdown patches on
the I 78550 you both the luma tree
effect enhanced test and the non luma
tree test declined by around 5% although
the performance decline is slightly
higher on the i-5 5,200 you on a
performance constrained device like an
ultraportable seeing any performance
slowdowns in Premiere it's a big deal as
most of these laptops run a fine line
between being capable of editing videos
and delivering a choppy mess Photoshop
suffers from the patches as well though
it does depend on the filter you're
using one of the most intensive in the
application is the iris blur which takes
11% longer on intel's
h√± cpus and 19% longer on fifth gen
after the patches are applied this is a
bit of a worst-case scenario as a number
of the less intensive field to see a
negligible difference but this is a
reminder that only some workloads are
hit by the patches even within an
application for benchmarking enthusiasts
like us it's disappointing to see one of
our favorite tools Microsoft Excel
suffer from a performance hit due to the
security patches on both the KB Lake
refresh and Broadwell ultraportable
platforms the Montecarlo workload takes
a four to six percent performance hit
which is in line with most other drops
would have seen compression and
decompression is a very interesting
workload to test before and after the
patches in 7-zip performance is mostly
unchanged with the only real decline
seen in compression on the i5 5200 you
to the tune of 4%
however in winrar compression things get
a bit crazy with the i7
8550 years showing performance
improvements while the i5 5200 you gets
it with a 6 percent performance drop
it's strange but I double and
triple-check this result and you guess
it came up the same every time MATLAB is
another workload where Broadwell is
affected more than KB Lake refresh on
the i5 5200 you simulation performance
drop by a rather significant 15% while
on the i-5 8550 you the impact was less
severe at just 5% while neither of the
dell XPS 13 czar benchmarked are very
good gaming machines I thought it'd also
be interesting to look at 3d mark this
test mostly hits the integrated GPU
rather than the CPU so it's not a
massive surprise to see no real
performance impact here the final set of
tests I'll be looking at our storage
benchmarks because it's here we saw the
biggest impact on the desktop platforms
it's a similar story on both a PCIe and
SATA SSD equipped laptops here with
massive reductions in performance seen
in nearly every situation the 8th gen
XPS 13 with a PCIe nvme SSD suffers
significantly in a sequential write test
with the performance decrease of 24%
whereas the fifth gen XPS 13 with a SATA
SSD is largely unaffected
with q21 thread ran the performance
though the 8th gen system takes a 5 and
15 percent hit in reads and writes
respectively
where's the fifth gen system gets
punished with 18 and 39 percent drops
it's interesting to see how other cue
depths and thread counts affect
performance with 8 thread 8 queue depth
random transfers the 8th gen system
takes a 14% hit in both reads and writes
while the Broadwell machine takes a
larger 34% hit in reads by the same 14%
hit in writes and then switching to a
single thread round transfer with the
queue depth of 32 and the Saito drive
gets punished with more than a 40%
reduction in performance in both reads
and writes compared to 35 and 12% drops
in reads and writes respectively on the
PCIe drive in the end the performance
impact of meltdown and Specter patches
is a bit more severe on laptops with an
Intel u series CPU inside compared to
the desktop platform Steve looked at
earlier on the desktop most productivity
workloads saw performance drops that
were inside the margin of error or in
other words you know only a few percent
at best
however on both kb lake refresh and
broadway laptops i looked at here almost
every workload was impacted by an amount
that's too large to attribute to the
margin of error workloads like Cinebench
x264 encoding Excel Premiere Photoshop
and MATLAB all experience noticeable
performance declines typically around
the 5% mark though the worst case was a
19 percent drop in Photoshop on the i5
5200 you other tests like PC mark
handbrake 3d mark and both compression
and decompression though were largely
unaffected one of the more interesting
things to note from these benchmarks is
there doesn't seem to be a significant
difference in the amount of slowdown
between the three year-old Broadwell
laptop and the modern cable a refreshed
laptop in productivity workloads it's
certainly not a situation where the
older and slower Broadwell is affected
more than your parts in fact in some
situations the 8th gen parts are hit
harder while in others 5th gen suffers
more we'll continue to monitor the
situation with the meltdown and
two patches especially as it sounds like
a number of updates have been causing
random crashes and other instability
problems on older hardware in fact just
today Intel has advised OMS to pull
their Spectre BIOS updates due to these
problems and there have been some
reports the updates don't even fix the
vulnerabilities I personally didn't see
any crashes testing the laptops I looked
at for this video but you know no doubt
we'll be seeing even more updates to try
and lock down these issues in the coming
weeks and months and of course we'll let
you know if any of them further affect
its system performance as always if
you've appreciated our testing of
meltdown inspector over the last few
weeks
