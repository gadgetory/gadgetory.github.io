have some more red on green violence for
you actually we have quite a bit of it
if I'm honest
last month I gave you guys a preview
over the work that was going into
creating this video by showing you the
are X 480 vs gtx 1060 results most of
you really seemed to enjoy that video
and it was great to see such a large
number of you taking to the comments and
having a really good discussion
anyway after weeks of hitting the test
machine whenever add the chance all the
results are in from the lowly gtx 1050
@rx 460 graphics cards to the mighty
wallet crushing titan XP testing so many
GPUs for a single comparison throws up a
few challenges and I don't just mean
simply because you have to run well over
1000 tests the challenge is more down to
how you test and show the data providing
an apples to apples comparison includes
low end GPUs as well as extreme GPUs
isn't easy and if I'm honest it's not
really practical either for the most
part we used ultra type quality settings
and even at 1080p the GTX 1050 and rx
460 are better suited to medium or
higher quality settings in today's games
meanwhile graphics cards such as the
Titan X fear usually CPU limited 1080p
even when using the ultra quality
settings in the end I decided to test at
Teddy P and 1440p using the maximum or
near enough to maximum in-game quality
settings realistically these settings do
lend themselves best for testing sort of
mid-range Hardware such as the rx 480
and GTX 1060 series which we've already
seen so while you can compare the rx 460
and gtx 1050 and the upcoming results I
will be retesting yet again at 1080p
using more suitable quality settings in
the near future the point of this video
or at least one point is to show you
just how much difference there is in
performance between the current
generation lineup when all things are
equal that said for lower end GPUs I
would recommend focusing on the tally
pair results as they often become
crippled at 1440p for one reason or
another causing them to form much
further behind the mid-range GPUs and
they would under more realistic
conditions likewise the gtx 1070 1080
and titan XP putting their best showing
at 1440p
though the Titan XP would look even
better had I tested at 4k as well since
the Titan XP and GT X 1080 really are
the only 4k capable GPUs I didn't bother
testing that resolution for those
results please check any of our previous
reviews featuring those GPUs for testing
we've used our core i7 test system which
features a core i7 6700k processor
overclocked unlocked at 4.5 gigahertz
the latest AMD and NVIDIA drivers
available at the time of testing were
used in total 16 games were tested all
of which are 2016 triple-a releases this
means older games such as GTA 5 for
example were left out as they're not
2016 releases and we've already tested
these games to death I will still test
games such as GTA 5 but for this
comparison I really want to see how the
latest AMD and NVIDIA GPUs stack up in
the latest games with that let's move on
to see how they do released in January
rise of the Tomb Raider was one of the
if not the most visually impressive
games released last year better still it
plays incredibly well on mid-range
Hardware we're maxed out using their
very high quality preset although Nvidia
does have an engineered advantage in
this title we see that the rx 460 is
able to hang there with the gtx 1050
moving to 1440p the mid-range cards do
suffer at times falling into the mid-30s
here the high-end gtx 1070 offers a real
nice performance boost over the gtx 1060
and our X 480 GPUs the tranquil
environments that can be enjoyed in Far
Cry primal get me every time I'll stop
for just a moment to enjoy a nice River
with a rocky backdrop and then BAM an
angry doll appears out of nowhere and
tries to make a meal of me thankfully
they have glass jaws and go down easier
than an MMA fighter that's tried to stay
in the game too long anyway getting to
the data ham we see the mid-range
contenders were able to deliver around
60fps at 1080p using the ultra quality
settings the GTX 1050 series isn't bad
either
while the RX 460 falls behind in this
title jumping to 1440p you will want a
gtx 1070 to push over 60fps meanwhile if
100 FPS is more your gem then a Titan XP
is more the shot
though buying one of those things right
now might give you the urge to
self-terminate in a few weeks time after
much hype the division was also released
back in March sadly it was quickly
discovered that Ubisoft repetitive
gameplay strikes again
apparently a new patch has made the game
much better but once you quit the grind
you never go back I say anyway the game
does now support the DirectX 12 API and
since we saw no negative impact on
performance for the NVIDIA GPUs this is
how I'll be testing the game going
forward please note I am using a longer
more demanding path to test the game now
and this seems to have swung the results
slightly in Nvidia's favor when
comparing the rx 480 and gtx 1060 no
this wasn't done to favor Nvidia that's
just how their results with this more
in-depth test turned out overall it's
fair to say that the mid-range rx 480
and GTX 1060 GPUs deliver a similar
experience the GTX 1050 and rx 460
appear to be neck-and-neck in this one
while the 1052 eye gets stomped by the
RX 470 moving to 1440p the R X 480 skips
slightly ahead of the GTX 1060 for those
wanting an average of 60fps the gtx 1070
will be required though it has to be
said that the gtx 1080 provides a
noticeably better experience again
hitman is one of those games where we
test AMD cards using DirectX 12 and
NVIDIA cards using DirectX 11 this is a
testing method that fanboys seem to
really love anyway as I've said before I
test some games this way for a few
reasons
first and foremost no GeForce owner will
run the game using DirectX 12 as there
is nothing to gain rather you just lose
a few frames secondly we know NVIDIA
GPUs don't do well in DirectX 12 we've
proved this time and time again we did
so first back in 2015 with the ashes of
singularity game also this isn't a game
that really needs DirectX 12 support
providing you have a balanced system in
my opinion game such as ashes really do
need the support of a low-level API
regardless of the GPU used there aren't
thousands of human or AI controlled
characters getting around at any one
point in hitman
so the CPU doesn't get hit nearly as
hard finally nvidia gpus can be seen
underperforming and hitman when using
either DX 11 or D x12
this is an AMD supported title as you
can see the RX for 80 for example easily
beats the GTX 1060 when looking at the
average frame rate that said the
minimums are quite close
moving to 1440p the rate on GPU seen a
pool further ahead though the GTX 1050
is able to beat out the 2 gigabyte rx
460 also here the gtx 1070 is just 27
percent faster than the RX 480 8
gigabyte quantum break is another game
that should never be played using the
DirectX 12 API with an NVIDIA GPU we saw
at least a 10 FPS boost for the
mid-range GeForce GPU s when moving from
the Windows Store DX 12 version to the
steamed X 11 version
meanwhile the AMD cards deliver the
exact same performance using either DX
11 or dx12 for those wondering when
running the DX 12 version on the gtx
1060 cards they are slightly slower than
the RX 4 80s meanwhile using steams dx11
build the gtx 1060 is able to pull well
ahead interestingly at 1080p the gtx
1070 isn't even 15% faster than the GTX
1060 in this title kim kardashian
thought her bumper stopper got some
attention then tracer came along and the
internet went into a fizz not wanting to
fall out of the limelight tracer
recently announced that she actually
plays for the other team but I guess
that's not really a big deal in today's
day and age is it right anyway moving on
this is another Nvidia special and we
see that the gtx 1060 and gtx 1050
series are able to outpace their AMD
rivals still with the RX 462 gigabyte
pushing over 60 FPS at 1080p using the
ultra quality settings this isn't
exactly a big deal for over 60 FPS 1440p
you will require a gtx 1050 TI that said
for those rocking a higher refresh rate
displays something like the gtx 1070
will still be in order it really is
crazy how underwhelming the Radeon GPUs
were in doom when using OpenGL given how
overpowered they are when using Vulcan
that said it is interesting to note that
although in videos GPUs featuring only 2
gigabytes of memory really suffer in
this title at 1080p using the ultra
quality preset 2 gigabyte AMD GPUs fare
considerably worse this can be seen when
comparing the 2 gigabyte variants of the
rx 460 and GTX 10
50 moving to 1440p the gtx 1066 gigabyte
is only able to match the performance of
the RX 474 gigabyte in this title when
using the Vulcan API
still those with deep pockets will be
best served by in videos Titan XP which
remains locked at 200 FPS even at 1440p
like ashes of the singularity total war
Warhammer is another game that I feel
should be played using the DirectX 12
API with either AMD or Nvidia Hardware
that being the case I've tested all
graphics cards using the DirectX 12 API
with the unlimited video memory option
enabled interestingly at 1080p using the
very high quality settings there X 460
suffers massive frame dips in both the 2
gigabyte and 4 gigabyte configurations
in spite of that the RX 470 was able to
beat both the GTX 1063 gigabyte and 6
gigabyte versions moving to 1440p we see
similar performance trends though here
the RX 470 does drop behind the 6
gigabyte 1060 to match the 3 gigabyte
model Mirror's Edge catalyst provides a
close battle between the mid-range and
low-end GPUs the mid-range contenders
all pushed over 60 fps at 1080p using
the ultra quality preset while the RX
460 and base model gtx 1050 were limited
to frame rates in the mid-30s at 1440p
the mid-range GPU struggle a bit making
the gtx 1070 a more desirable option
here even so the GTX 1080 offers huge
performance gains over the 1070 while
the Titan XP is faster again as you
would expect
here we see some very competitive
performance in f1 2016 the RX 460 and
gtx 1050 deliver a similar experience as
did the RX 480 and gtx 1060 with the RX
470 also getting amongst it four
perfectly playable performance at 1080p
using the ultra quality preset I
recommend a mid-range GPU such as the rx
470 now at 1440p we find much the same
that set ideally gamers will want a gtx
1070 or faster for perfectly smooth
performance at all times Deus Ex mankind
Nevada was tested exclusively using the
DirectX 12 API since NVIDIA GPUs deliver
the same performance using either
DirectX 11 or DirectX 12 in this title
so it seems plausible at geforce owners
would you
directx12 here anyway is an AMD
supported title the radians tend to run
away with it as the RX 460 just beats
the GTX 1050 and the same can be said
for the rx 480 in relation to the GTX
1060 that said for gamers seeking even
greater frame rates the gtx 1070 offers
a nice boost gaming at 1440p using the
second highest quality preset does
really require a gtx 1080 which is
pretty shocking
of course gamers can reduce the quality
settings further to the high preset and
to be honest this doesn't really
sacrifice the visuals too heavily
battlefield ones another game where I
have tested the AMD cards using DirectX
12 and the Nvidia card using DirectX 11
truth be told we have shown in the past
an NVIDIA GPUs deliver the same
performance using DirectX 11 and DirectX
12 in this title though the frame times
do seem more consistent overall when
using DirectX 11 for the most part the
AMD GPUs do enjoy a small performance
boost when using the dx12 api overall
performance between the gtx 1060 and our
X 480 GPUs is much the same whichever
way you look at it meanwhile the GTX
1050 is able to pull a little ahead of
the rx 460 even at 1440p in this
visually impressive game the mid-range
GPUs are able to deliver over 60fps on
average the only exception being the rx
470 though it has to be said even at
this resolution it's still very
impressive for going beyond 60fps though
you will require a gtx 1070 well they
are trying guys but I'm not sure free
DLC is what this game needs let's shoot
for a performance patch next time to
games if the GTX 1060 can push 90 FPS at
1080p in the maxed out battlefield 1 is
it too much to us for a solid 60 FPS in
mafia 3 right now if you want to stay
around 60 FPS you'll have to shell out
for a gtx 1070 and we're talking about
that 1080p performance here it is also
worth pointing out that at present
NVIDIA GPUs do have a rather large
advantage in this poorly optimized title
forget 1440p gaming with all the bells
and whistles turned on unless you have a
GTX 1080 or Titan XP I can't believe the
gtx 1060 and our X 480 are only pushing
around 30fps here Gears of War 4 is a
DirectX 12 only title so
naturally both AMD and NVIDIA GPUs have
been tested using this API here we see
the same 84 FPS from both the GTX 1060
and rx 480
while the 4 gigabyte 480 is 6 FPS faster
than the 3 gigabyte 1060 bumping the
resolution up to 1440p we are still able
to achieve playable performance on the
mid-range GPUs but for the more
desirable 60 FPS performance I would
recommend a gtx 1070 in my opinion
titanfall 2 ended up being a much better
game than expected even the
single-player campaign was quite fun and
surprisingly lengthy anyway the other
great thing about this game is how well
it plays on the PC using the very high
quality preset the RX 460 and GT x 1050
both average 61 fps meanwhile the
mid-range contenders were pushing into
the 80s
even at 1440p those rocking in our X 480
or gtx 1060 will consistently see frame
rates in the 60s the civilization 6
results from the previous are X 480 vs
gtx 1060 video have been dropped and
replaced with these results using the
new patch in DirectX 12 support so they
won't be comparable previously the
GeForce GPU is were slightly faster
using DirectX 11 but now with DirectX 12
support AMD is able to match in video in
this title at least when comparing the
RX 480 and GTX 1060 the GTX 1050 does
still lead the RX 460 meanwhile the 1070
1080 and Titan XP are only able to offer
slightly stronger minimum frame rates we
are obviously running into a CPU
bottleneck at 1080p surprisingly even at
1440p the higher-end Nvidia cards are
still limited to the same performance in
fact despite increasing the resolution
the performance trends remain all much
the same Call of Duty infinite warfare
is another late 2016 release that
allowed AMD to come home strong here the
R X 480 leads the GTX 1060 by a
reasonable margin and the rx 460 is even
able to close in on the GTX 1050
although the RX 460 did only averaged 44
fps the RX 488 gigabyte was good for 86
FPS even at 1440p the R X 480 remains
very strong and here we see the full
gigabyte model sticking with the 8
gigabyte version allowing it to beat the
GTX 1060 once again though we find that
those wanting to stay above 60fps at all
times the gtx 1070 will be required
since our initial dishonored to testing
the game's performance has dramatically
improved particularly those minimum
frame rates it is also worth noting the
section the game we test isn't that
demanding on the CPU and yet we still
find that higher-end GPUs are being
limited at 1080p for that reason the
1070 isn't that much faster than 1060
while the 1080 and Titan X pair only a
few frames faster than the 1070
nevertheless Nvidia does appear to enjoy
a rather large performance advantage in
this title at this time even at 1440p
the GTX 1070 1080 on Titan XP are or
performance limited meanwhile the three
gigabyte 1060 is able to best the eight
gigabyte our X 480
while the 1050 easily beats the RX 460
finally the last game tester was
watchdogs 2 and here we see some very
consistent performance scaling from the
slowest GPUs tested to the fastest again
Nvidia appears to have a reasonable
performance advantage in this game as
the gtx 1060 comfortably beats the RX
480
upping the resolution or 1440p we find
that gamers will really require a gtx
1070 to enjoy perfectly smooth
performance
meanwhile the gtx 1080 was another 20%
faster while the titan XP was almost 50%
faster as i noted last time the power
figures aren't really going to change
and it doesn't really make sense to
benchmark the AMD cards using the new
Radeon chill feature as this will make
them look considerably slower than they
really are
a doddle the geforce cards consumed
around 10 watts less and under low we
see quite a large difference in
invidious favour here we see the RX 480
a gigabyte does consume more power than
the gtx 1070 and not a great deal less
than the gtx 1080 so now that we have
all the data room how do these GPUs
compare overall well for this video I
won't do a normal breakdown like what
you would have seen in the RX 4 80
versus gtx 1060 video because we'd be
here all week doing that kind of
breakdown instead I'll just compare the
average frame rates from all 19 games as
an average figure in the following graph
this should give you a pretty good idea
of how much faster or slower one GPU is
from another right so the light blue
bars
represent 1080p performance with the
darker blue showing the average 1440p
results something that jumps out at me
right away here is the GTX 1050 and rx
460 results granted for the most part
the quality settings used were a bit too
extreme here we see that the 1050 is
just 13 percent faster than the 460 when
comparing the two gigabyte models that
does sound like a bit and while it is in
our previous 23 game comparison the
GeForce GPU was 18% faster so the margin
has reduced and with the relief driver
offering around a four to five percent
performance boost in quite a few titles
this driver improvement along with the
better game support for Radeon GPUs
really is helping AMD something else you
might have noticed is that although the
gtx 1066 cube i was 1% faster than the
RX for a 8 gigabyte in our previous
video the radeon GPU is now 2 percent
faster causing this small difference is
down to a few changes made to the
testing whereas the gtx 1060 was
previously 9% faster in the civilization
6 test it's now on par with the RX 480
thanks to the DirectX 12 update that
change is also seen the GTX 1063
gigabyte model now trailing the RX 484
gigabyte by a 5% margin whereas
previously it was just 2 percent slower
meanwhile the RX 470 was just 4% slower
than the three gigabyte 1060
and with that priced around 15% lower
this is why we named it the best value
sub $200 GPU back in November at 1440p
the gtx 1070 was 37 percent faster than
gtx 1060 not bad but it does cost at
least 50% more so gamers are paying a
fair premium for that silky smooth 1440p
gaming experience the situation is much
the same again when going from the 1070
to the 1080 you get a little over 20%
more performance but you have to pay a
little over 50% more to get it this of
course isn't new information we found
the exact same margins back in June last
year well I think that's a pretty good
summary of the current performance
gamers can expect from these GPUs at
least in relation to one another as I
said earlier I will be retesting erics
460 and gtx 1050 using more appropriate
quality settings and as a bit of a side
note for that upcoming test for those
wondering I will not be throwing an Rx
for 60 with an unlocked bios the reason
being that one of my two Rx for 60 s
failed the unlock forcing me to roll
back the BIOS that in itself isn't an
issue the real issue being that the
Reliv driver looks for an AMD BIOS
signature for Polaris based cards and
without that the drivers won't work
there is a rather complex workaround
using a modded driver but honestly for a
lousy up to five percent performance
bump is it worth the hassle every time
AMD releases a new driver which at the
moment is every other week so for now at
least I personally don't think the RX
460 unlock method is worth pursuing
no doubt there will be some of you that
disagree with me but that's my opinion
and anyway let's not get too bogged down
with that for now
the good news for shoppers is currently
it looks very competitive in the low-end
to mid-range market segment so this will
be great for pricing moving forward it's
going to get pretty crazy this year on
the GPU front and I anticipate many more
late nights benchmarking also as new
games and drives are released I will
continue to update my results and make
new comparison videos along the way so
stay tuned for those I'm your host Steve
and I'll catch you on the next one
