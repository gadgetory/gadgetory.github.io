are talking about a topic that seems to
just keep popping up no matter how many
times we put it down as soon as the
g-force 20 series was announced too many
of you started requesting that we
monitor in videos driver development to
make sure they didn't start
intentionally slowing down the previous
generation Pascal GPUs an effort to make
chewing look a bit more appealing
it seems the team over at ufd tech we're
also seeing similar requests and this
time last week they decided to look into
it I've actually been doing the same
thing so in their video popped up a week
ago I was interested to see if they'd
been seeing the same thing as me which
was diddly-squat Wright began the video
by suggesting that they had caught in
video route so right away my interest
was piqued about 6 minutes and 30
seconds later though the testing was all
wrapped up and in my opinion there were
just a few surprising results most
looked to be sort of margin of error
type stuff certainly nothing alarming
but Bret seemed pretty convinced that
that was evidence of gimping however
after wrapping up the testing he went on
to say they just got their hands on the
new 4 11.7 T driver and that restored
performance the same level seen
previously with the 399 24 driver which
was the last publicly available driver
before Nvidia released the RT X series
the driver that they found the issues
with was drive immersion for 1163 and
that was the first publicly available
driver to support the RT X series so he
concluded that driver probably just had
a bug that nerfed performance on the
Pascal GPUs so all very interesting I
had a few thoughts about the video but
never intended to make any kind of reply
at least not directly like I am with
this video which is why this video ended
up coming a week later
since ufd tech published their video
we've received dozens upon dozens of
requests for us to look into this both
in the comments section of unrelated
videos that we published last week and
on our various social media platforms
that we use a viewer on twitter reached
out to science studio paul's hardware JS
to sense and harbor unboxed to see if we
could look into the video published by
ufd tech though claiming that in video
was enduring the
g-force ten series and give our opinion
I simply replied with did you watch the
entire video Paula and Jay also weighed
into the conversation with their own
thoughts now before I continue with I
suppose my take on this subject I just
like to make it very clear that I'm not
calling you FD Tech out in this video I
respect the work that Brett and his team
do and I'd ask anyone watching this
video do the same they've done nothing
wrong here at least nothing really wrong
and I think I can add some value to the
conversation given that I have spent
thousands possibly upon thousands of
hours benchmarking I will just say
though as a viewer and a fan of ufd tech
I wasn't wasn't that wrapped with the
format of the video I felt that it would
have been much better if they just show
the results for all three drivers from
the start of the video to avoid
misleading any viewers because we all
know the second someone sees results
that they want to see they're taking a
screenshot and running over to Reddit
claiming that Nvidia is the devil and
well I'm sure you guys know how that
goes I'm can understand how annoying it
would have been for them having done all
that testing thinking that they're onto
something they probably should have
double-checked the numbers but anyway
they did a lot testing so good on them
and then everybody it goes and releases
a new driver they install that and find
that out hang on we're back to where we
started
so that's a very frustrating when that
happens we deal with that sort of stuff
a lot so I can certainly understand why
they didn't want to go back and
completely restructure the video but
ultimately that's probably what they
should have done if we look at the top
comments on Bret's video we see stuff
like nothing surprises me with
ingredient video is aware that people
are gobbling up those ten series cards
on the use market myself included we
need AMD to save us now nvidia is so
scummy nowadays Lowell greedy Nvidia
trying to scam their customers any way
possible they need to make 1080i bad so
they can sell 20/80 nice bathroom hmm
okay I think that last one is unrelated
at least to this subject possibly not to
the video but anyway I did like the
comment made by Johnny six for one come
on guys you're ready to call out and
video for gimping cards over to FPS
difference input
this is well within a margin of error
I'm all for calling out companies for
shitty practices but this is a bit
ridiculous by your own test you guys
struggled to tell the difference between
sixty Hertz and 240 Hertz so how in the
hell would two FPS even be perceivable
off topic there is a world of difference
between sixty Hertz and 240 Hertz that's
like a night and day difference but
suppose I'm getting a bit off topic
there he is right with the first part 1
to 2 FPS is well within the margin of
error for testing and I will show
exactly that in a moment there won't be
many benchmarks in this video as there
is there's honestly nothing to report I
have done a whole heap of testing I've
spent over a day checking a whole heap
of games and yeah nothing at all to
report but I will talk a bit about
benchmarking practices and explain why I
think they saw some of the results that
they did all up I believe they tested
about 11 titles which is certainly a
good number and good on them for
investing so much time and effort I can
certainly appreciate that the biggest
performance drop was seen in ashes of
the singularity with the GTX 1082 I
using the higher quality preset at 4k
and I assume they were using the DirectX
12 API but that wasn't specified here
the 1080 t I lost 6 FPS on average
dropping down from 98 to 92 fps Metro
last light dropped to 2 FPS which at the
low frame rates that they were seeing at
4k meant it was about a 5 percent drop
in performance at Deus Ex mankind Nevada
dropped just a single frame for a 3
percent reduction and rise of the Tomb
Raider lost 4% for a 2 FPS drop shadow
of the Tomb Raider was 5 percent slower
dropping 3 fps and Final Fantasy 15 was
just 4 percent slower dropping just 2
fps
so with the exception of ashes of the
singularity some very minor reductions
they're certainly within the margin of
error and Bret commented that all the
Ubisoft titles saw no change and it was
a bit baffled as to why that was Ghost
Recon wildlands Assassin's Creed origins
and far cry 5 all showed no change the
same was also true for middle-earth
shadow of war and hit man with the GTX
1072 at 1440p Bret reported no change in
performance at all so the same results
with either driver and then the gtx 1060
at 1080p saw slightly mixed results
though all work within the margin of
error I myself have been testing the
Pascal
gpus with the four 1163 driver and i've
done so in a shipload of games and i
haven't found any noticeable difference
between it and the previous 399 24
driver I hadn't tested with Asha the
singularity as that's not really a great
GPU benchmark so a bad one but I
typically reserved it for CPU and sort
of system memory type testing stuff
anyway given their findings and pretty
much all of you guys seem to want us to
dig into this and do some testing I
thought why not have a look at ashes of
the singularity so using the DirectX 12
API and the higher-quality preset at 4k
weak the GTX 1080i I began testing for
this test I'm using the built in
benchmark and I'm not going to show any
data using a third-party tool like a cat
for example to report performance I did
check the frame time results though the
margins were identical to what I'm
showing here and they mostly focused on
their average frame rates cuz that's
where they saw some big changes so we'll
do the same so that being the case I am
just going to keep it simple and show
the average results for the normal and
heavy batches but again I have dug into
a lot more titles looked at frame time
performance and there is absolutely
nothing to report outside of the margin
of error I'm also going to show the
results for each individual run here
however unboxed all our data is based on
an average of three runs and I assume
ufd tech are doing the same and not just
reporting a single run so the first run
using the four 11.7 driver we saw an
average of 112 FPS for the normal tests
and 94 FPS for the heavy tests I then
ran at the display driver uninstall or
better known as DD you to remove the
driver and install a fresh version of
for 11.6 t3 and then I ran the tests
again this time I got an average of 115
FPS for the normal batch and the heavy
batch spent at a result of 96 FPS on
average so that is a two to three
percent improvement with the driver that
ufd tech claimed the bug with I then ran
ddu again installed driver 399 24 I ran
all the tests again and this time I got
114 FPS for the normal test and 96 FPS
for the heavy tests so that is a 2
percent increase over the for 1170
driver and I would certainly say that 2
percent is within the margin of error so
for me the latest driver actually
provided the worst result
to confirm that Iran DD you once again
reinstalled the 411 dot 70 drivers and
then rerun all the tests once again this
time of the normal batch test averaged
113 fps and the heavy batch 95 fps this
meant I clawed back just a single frame
for each test and now the four 11.7 a
driver was within 2% of the 4:11 dot 63
driver which again is very much in the
margin of error it's worth noting that
ash to the singularity even at 4k is
very much a system benchmark when using
the higher quality preset with the GT X
1080 Ti any change in memory or CPU
speed will impact the results not
massively but certainly by a few percent
and that's not something you will see
when using the crazy preset to
illustrate this point I went back and
reroute all the tests again but this
time with the crazy preset which makes
the game extremely GPU bound now all
three drivers provided the exact same
heavy batch result of 59 FPS with no
more than a 1% deviation for the normal
batch test had Brett's team tested ash
of the singularity using the crazy
preset I'm pretty certain they would
have found the same results as I did and
to tie him with that as I noted earlier
Brett was surprised that the Ubisoft
game showed no difference in performance
between the two drivers and I think I
know the reason for this and we're
talking about games such as Ghost Recon
wildlands Assassin's Creed origins and
Far Cry 5 and the reason is all three
titles are extremely GPU bound at the 4k
resolution even with mild quality
settings this leads me to believe that
there was possibly something going on
with our test system perhaps something
was running in the background they did
only see unexpected results in tests
that were heavily GPU bound and this is
what I'd expect to see if there was
something else running in the background
of course I can't be sure but that's how
I would interpret their data and we're
only talking about one game here really
ashes the singularity the rest of them
it was just margin of error stuff 1 or 2
FPS isn't really a difference worth
noting if they had of you know run DD
you got rid of the driver done a fresh
install and then taken I'll compared the
data over multiple runs 3des maybe even
six runs and taking the average you'd
probably find that the FPS margins were
at one at most possible
zero I should just follow up a note that
yes I'm aware that Assassin's Creed
origin hammers CPUs but I assume they
were probably using an 8700 K so that
means that the game would have been 100
percent GPU limited at the 4k resolution
you could probably down clock the 87 or
okay in fact I have done this to four
gigahertz from five gigahertz and you
don't see any change in framerate even
in the big cities for those of you
wondering I have tested all the games
just mentioned plus many more with all
three drivers and there's no noteworthy
changes into performance so some people
will be upset that I haven't shown that
data but it's really boring you just see
the gtx 1080i delivering the same
performance so i'm not going to show you
a holly / graphs that tell you no
information it's just complete waste of
your time and my time making the graphs
that tell you nothing now if nvidia did
nerf or gimp the geforce 10 series
whatever you want to call it even if it
was by mistake
that's still a seriously big deal and
something we would take very seriously
and it's a reason why I've kept in
Ireland I don't expect them to do it and
I'll talk about that in a moment
but at this point all the big names have
done all the big names in their industry
you know you Linus tech tips and all
those guys have done their testing and
they've done it with the 399 dot 24
driver so they don't really gain
anything by doing this with the first
public release driver and it's also just
a really really dumb thing for Nvidia to
do and therefore they'll never do it
deliberately gimping GPU performance via
the drivers just it's not a thing guys
it's a myth made up by fanboys it's just
it's not gonna happen it's certainly
worth keeping an eye on for sure if it's
only to spot a bug but it's seriously
not going to happen and there are
multiple reasons as for why it's never
going to happen one reason being and I'm
not saying this is the most important
reason or the most obvious reason but
it's certainly one reason is that it
would be bloody obvious and easy to spot
if they did do this all you need is a
previous driver which is extremely easy
to get in video even provides them on
their website alternatively there are
countless online resources where you can
get any Nvidia driver that's been
previously released throughout the years
and then you can compare them on a
single GPU in an appropriate title and
you will find your answer the newer
drivers should never be
slower outside of the margin of error I
see these comments all the time and you
FD Tech obviously get them a lot because
they decided to do the testing and make
their video and I believe they had a lot
of requests because we had a lot of
requests but I just thought it doesn't
make sense and it's certainly something
a video could do but they're just not
going to do it as I said what they could
do and probably do understandably so if
they do do what I'm about to suggest is
not invest the time optimizing for all
the hardware hardware that's more than a
few generations old take Kepler for
example Nvidia and the game developer as
well because the games also have to be
optimized for these older architectures
they're not going to spend a lot of time
optimizing old hardware they'll
certainly ensure that Kepler works and
there's no major bugs stopping it from
working as it should but they're not
going to invest loads and loads of time
fine shooting drivers and even the game
itself just so four year old hardware
can run as well as possible so if you
start to see I don't know half decade
old GPUs performing worse than expected
and the latest and greatest tiles that's
probably what's going on Nvidia and AMD
are deliberately gimping this old
hardware they just don't want to invest
the time money it takes to get it to its
peak level of performance and they still
want to be beating the other team in the
graphs when we do our big you know 50
GPU tests they don't want to see the GTX
780 right down the bottom getting
smashed by the r9 390 that's not
particularly a good look not great for
business so they will want to make sure
that it's operating close to where it
should be they just as I said don't want
to invest too much time or money on this
old hardware now let's talk a bit more
about benchmarking that easy thing that
anyone with no experience can do because
they just need to click the benchmark a
button or have MSI Afterburner open
while they spot check the FPS counter
every now and then hey ma I'm
benchmarking I'm basically gamers Nexus
seriously though benchmarking it really
isn't that hard benchmarking accurately
though and comparing multiple data sets
whether it's different drivers or
different hardware that can be a bit of
a chore as it does take quite a bit of
time and experience
to do well I'm not suggesting the guys
at UF D Tech don't know how to benchmark
I'm not doing that
at all but I would just like to explain
why some of the results may get a little
cattywampus at times for this particular
testing step one would be to create a
fresh install of Windows 10 to make sure
there's nothing influencing the results
there because you really do want a clean
and sterile system for driver testing
not necessarily for other things but for
this test it certainly makes sense you
want to remove any other factors as much
as possible so fresh install of Windows
10 then if it installs a default driver
which it often does you want to then
reboot in a safe mode used edu to
uninstall that driver and then boot back
into Windows and install a pre
downloaded version of the driver that
you're going to be testing with once
you're done with that driver don't be
tempted to just install the newer driver
or the older driver that can leave some
old or newer driver elements behind so
reboot back in a safe mode used edu to
completely clean up the driver that
you're currently using then you can boot
back into Windows and install the new
driver so yeah very important step for
this kind of testing especially if you
want to gather accurate data other
things that can skew the results ever so
slightly include air bloody air
sometimes it's cool other times it's
less cool ambient air temp can affect
the results by a few percent generally
fans will spin up to offset a higher
ambient temperature but that's not
always a fix they might already be
spinning at or close to full speed and
any increase in temperature will force
the hardware to begin throttling
temperatures can also affect CPU
performance and you'll notice this in
sort of system benchmarks like ashes of
the singularity the GeForce 10 series
also makes use of GPU boost 3.0 which
again can skew the results by a few
percent nothing major but if you're
looking for small performance changes
this can cause them ideally you want to
run the game for around 10 minutes
before you begin testing as this allows
the card to find its maximum operating
temperature and this sees that run at a
sustained operating frequency for sure
to test where the card hasn't fully
heated up the operating frequency can
spike quite a bit higher than the
sustained frequency and this will lead
to a few extra frames another big issue
is updates games regularly update in
some
we don't even notice it which makes
retesting quite important of course
there are also Windows updates to
contend with and even simple stuff like
BIOS updates though those are a little
easier to spot because they are carried
out manually but you have to be aware
that you've done it put that in the back
of the old noggin to make sure all the
settings are back the way they meant to
be again I'm not suggesting that you FD
tech unaware of all of this stuff and
that they made any mistakes here and
Bret did say that they did all the
testing within one day so it's unlikely
that they got caught out with any kinds
of updates as far as I'm aware there's
been no update to ash of the singularity
during that period
now the basic things include how many
runs you make is the data based on an
average of three runs for example pretty
much all the tech sites and channels
that I'm aware of base their numbers on
at least three runs and most of them
make this known but yeah make sure that
the data is based on an average of
multiple runs and not just a single run
as I noted earlier any small changes to
the BIOS can impact performance so you
need to ensure that the configuration
remains exactly the same throughout all
your testing I usually check CPU and
memory performance before benchmarking
games with software such as Ida 64
that's really good for doing all that
kind of stuff and yeah it just allows me
to make sure the system is where it
should be you also want to make sure
software running in the background such
as Steam for example isn't downloading
or installing any updates as this again
can impact performance by a few
percentage points also it's good
benchmark practice to start over from
scratch when you find strange results I
only did this about half a dozen times
when I was testing horizon for the first
time fun stuff that was that's also a
good idea to ask others in the industry
what they're seeing it's my experience
that a lot of the guys in this industry
are very helpful and if you have some
odd or strange results reach out to them
tell them what you're seeing and they
will often check it in a timely manner
for you so yeah that helps avoid
publishing anything that may be
incorrect anyway it is good to see guys
like Bret and his team working to keep
hardware company such as in video on
their toes so definitely don't want to
discourage that we just have to be a bit
more careful about how we deliver the
message most people won't make it to the
end of a video to catch the punchline
and on that note I'm going to end this
one as I'm probably only talking to
about 50% of the viewers that we started
with
