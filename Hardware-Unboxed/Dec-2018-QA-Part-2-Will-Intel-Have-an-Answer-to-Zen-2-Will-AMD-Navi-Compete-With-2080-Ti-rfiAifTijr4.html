part 2 of our final QA of the year the
December QA of course you'll have seen
part 1 on the channel yesterday maybe a
couple of days ago if you'll go back and
watch definitely watch it because all
the good questions are of course in part
1 and will leave all the dodgy questions
from part 2 p VA go go watch that might
have been couple days ago because
hopefully i schedule up a bit for the
slaughter yeah that's right super slow
at this time of year but anyway we've
got some more questions to cover so
let's get into it
ok the donbot from our discard chat has
asked do you think 3rd gen rising is
going to be a mic drop from the red team
if so do you think intel will have an
answer particularly do you think intel
will start competing at current AMD
price points well there's a lot of
things going on there there is gee I
think Intel it seems like we saw from
their architecture event that they
realize something to compete so I think
that's one part of the question is well
I think yeah possibly if I mean yeah it
really depends on AMD does so we've seen
some some rumors of what they're going
to do which look pretty phenomenal
you know Tim called some of them into
question but these it's going to be good
no matter what it is so initially for at
least part of the at least half of the
year I would say at least time you Intel
is Yona find themselves and in a
difficult position that compete so will
they reduce prices to become competitive
with AMD well again that depends on
where AMD prices the new CPUs and how
they perform of course how they perform
all that kind of stuff so I don't I know
a lot of people are jumping up and down
saying Intel's done they destroyed next
year yeah I mean we're not saying it's
one way or the other really but I'd
rather just wait and see
yeah I tend to agree I mean I think
there's a lot of technologies that we
know we're going to give AMD a fairly
strong improvement 7 nanometers
some of us into architecture things that
they've already announced are definitely
very promising for making their products
better but I think the way that the sort
of CPUs release cycle goes that there's
always the last copies there's been that
six month window between AMD releases
then six months later Intel releases
their new product so yeah as you say
they'll probably that short window where
AMD is probably in a position where it's
like that I'd do a my crop and into a
struggle sticker P but you've
interesting to see where it's at at the
end of next year
does Intel actually have ten nanometer
TECA so either way I mean the winners
are going to be us the guys buying the
CPUs and using them because there's
gonna be some and there's already some
incredible bargains you look at the
market today compared to two years ago
it's unbelievable I think next year it's
just gonna get better so yeah it's
really good news no matter what alright
good question here from YouTube why has
no one done a dedicated i7 9700 K review
yet millions on the 9900 but nothing on
the 9700 as far as temps what is it like
without hyper threading is it any good
you have one right yeah yeah I've had
one since day one I've got two should
probably give you one a I mean I've only
got one it's a good CPU I suppose I mean
people gonna be like oh AMD fanboy
that's why you haven't done it you're an
AMD fanboy hey the real reason is a lot
of the excitement and interest around
these ninth gen chips kind of was went
out the window when we saw a fail
ability and pricing yep there wasn't a
huge amount of interest I've got a 9600
K as well I know it's mostly a refresh
product with a bit of soldering like the
high-end desktop series but yeah I just
it's not super exciting I suppose we
said I focused on the 9th hour ok and
gave that a bit more attention because
there was the whole 95 watt TDP thing
there which was worth investigating
yeah maybe I'll do one in January I feel
like I probably skip the review I'd like
to do a massive game benchmark
comparison like a whole heap of games
and see how it compares to the 99 or
okay the 8700 okay and then the rise in
seven 2700 X so maybe that's something
I'll spend my entire January doing on
the side but I could include temps and
whatnot but a surely there's some
information out there of temperature
yeah temperature stuff on the 97 record
I don't think I had time to include that
in my day 1 review anyway hopefully that
our next question is which discontinued
game would you like to see make a
comeback mine Prince of Persia and
legacy of kain long as you haven't heard
of that one is that mad ok good we can't
bear to be that useful Shirley Shirley
hmm well as command &amp;amp; Conquer been
discontinued yeah it has hasn't it yeah
it's been a while a very long time if
they could bring it back to be like the
quality of the Westwood days which was
good for its time I probably like to see
that well yeah so they say franchise so
yeah the commander conquer franchise I'd
love to see that make a comeback and not
we thought you sort of renegade what was
it called renegade gold that was the one
that was like a first-person shooter
type thing Joe may hear about that say
that forget about it ah yeah bring it
back is a real-time strategy game so let
the birds do their thing for a minute
then Tim can answer that one yeah I
thought a lot about this I think there's
some of the franchises I think that I
would love to see like another entry in
like Star Wars Knights The Old Republic
it's kind of they're already making new
Star Wars single-player games so I'm not
sure whether that counts as being
discontinued or not yeah I'll try say no
so yeah I guess that was my main I that
was my main idea so so Comerica nobody
brought back stars Battlefront so that
was one of the ones I was really hoping
I would continue
yeah they hacked that up there yeah
there's stuff that up the first time the
second time they stuff it up again yeah
the second games a lot better though
thankfully yes well yeah it is it's a
it's a it's quite a game I'd be a one of
more recent one that's barely fuse I
would love to see a another dead space
game
there is because the third dead space
game was pre bad and the first two were
really good so yeah I think that would
be interesting to bring back but that's
another EA franchise that they'll
probably screw up so yeah well they
acquired Westwood studios and then
commander conch I went down the old
drain
so yeah it's on EA's okay Zak asks us on
YouTube what form factor is your go-to
previously ATX was the standard but now
the sound cards and Wi-Fi built into
most
ITX and even m ATX boards is it worth
the size requirements to build full
towers anymore okay was kind of two
parts that question is it worth it no
like as you just said you most gamers I
think have PCI Express times 16 graphics
card and that is about it
yeah in that case how many of you go
mini ITX it doesn't give you a whole lot
of room for upgrades and stuff micro
checks is perfectly fine doesn't save
you a huge amount there's a lot of very
compact ATX cases these days and the
disadvantage with micro ATX is there's
just not many motherboards so your
upgrade options are more limited your
initial options are more limited so
that's the downside of micro ATX like is
there even a micro HX X 470 board yet I
don't think there is and there's very
like there's a heap of full ATX extended
ATX Zen 390 boards but there are very
few and generally the micro ATX options
are crap as well I think there's nothing
like for Zen 390 micro ATX boards I
think pretty much all but one is they're
pretty like average they tend to be used
more for like entry-level budget stuff
yeah
so you sort of get a nice high end but
still obviously limited mini ITX and
then it's the step up to standard but if
you're not carrying your computer around
a landing then who cares I mean they all
fit under your desk so yep I think
that's that one so yeah my go-to would
be well my go-to I usually do high end
builds for my personal rigs so it's
extended ATX but yeah ATX basically yep
I think that's fair yep all right next
question given the fact that the Intel
sunny Cove is rumored by Intel to be a
process do you think Italy
backwards-compatible with Zed 390
chipsets or chipset or are we going to
have to change the whole suite of
components and to fit them yeah there is
absolutely no chance that it will be
backwards compatible with said 390 none
will not happen normally I would say I
because you know you don't know for sure
I don't know for sure but in this case
I'm pretty pretty sure like yeah I'm
going with Tim on this one yeah it's
just not Intel's playbook if I had to
bet big money on it I had to choose one
or the other that's the way I'd be going
with yeah it's your safest bet there I
think we'll see a new socket as well
simply because it's not while skylake
through to coffee like has been the same
architecture largely this widely the
same with 10 nanometer fully different
architecture new process node that's
usually the catalyst for Intel to go
with new socket new chipsets yeah yeah
yeah yeah this is basically zero chance
I would say about being compatible so
yeah that 390 will be I'll be dead I'll
be dead yep all right so we've got a
question here about Rison many people me
included have bought rise in 24 hundred
GS to wait out in Saint GPU prices now
we can buy proper GP for normal amount
of money but wouldn't rise in 2400 G be
a bottleneck it only has you know four
cores four megabytes of level three
cache it has you know limited PCIe and
all that
well yeah you're not gonna stick a r-tx
2017 2018 or 2080 sui with it I mean we
probably till 2017 and work well in some
games this is one of those very general
roundabout questions that I can't answer
in a couple of words because it depends
on what games you want to play so if you
wanna play fortnight your 2500 G is more
than sufficient the 2400 G has SMT so
it's four cores and threads yeah it's
not the fastest CPU going around I mean
if you I would recommend sticking a
gotta tell you for the integrated
graphics on that then get yourself an RX
570 what are they down to used to the
video on that on in 150 us 150 us that's
less than you paid for the APU so
sticker sticker an RX 570 in there and
you won't know yourself it'll imagine
you're playing at 1080p probably
downscaled at 720p to play off the APU
that's gonna be a brilliant upgrade that
so yeah it won't bottleneck that
anything significant I mean it in games
like Battlefield 5 you might be missing
out on a few frames but multiplayer that
is but every other game you'll be
getting the most out of it and that's
just yeah it makes sense anything up to
like an rx 588 gigabyte or GTX 1060
bottlenecking won't be an issue once you
start going above sort of like your Vega
56 gtx 1070 but at that point you're
talking about $400 graphics cards so you
can afford to put a rise in 5 or 6 2600
in there or whatever yep so and then the
PCI Express times 8 not an issue that
won't bottleneck those cards you won't
lose a frame they're really so yeah but
I think the the rx 570 is the way to go
okay another question from YouTube we're
visiting the subject of max Q design
laptops just how much better is a 1070
max Q than a full laptop 1060 and is it
much worse than a full laptop 1070 since
it's Christmas and people will be more
than likely looking at these max cube
products so from the sort of testing
that I did max cubes it's pretty much
exactly between the two GPUs so if you
figure out how much better is a 1070
then a 1060 put them on a scale the max
Q is right bang in the middle of the two
so you're probably going to be getting
about 10% more performance than a 1060
but then you'll be about 10% behind a
1070 so how consistent is gtx 1070 max
cube performance across say 12 if you've
got 12 max q laptops yep how much is it
going to vary with that you know you say
it's it's right between is that like a
typical good one or is that is that a
peak one that's writing a maximum
efficiency yeah I think most of them
clocked to roughly the same amount okay
so there's not a lot of sort of thermal
issues which is when you normally see I
know it's meant to be a sort of a tight
spec yeah yeah it is it is pretty tight
but from most of the laptops that I've
personally tested they've all been
pretty much exactly the same sort of
performance level so getting that
exactly in the middle of
- pretty typical yeah the good thing
with the max-q
is that while it is 1070 max-q is not as
powerful as a 1070 you can actually
overclock it because not it's not cut
down in the core in any way it's just
simply clocked a lot lower okay so it is
actually possible to install utility and
overclock that up to a 10 70 level
obviously your laptop's thermal solution
has to be good enough well you just
either that I imagine that to compromise
on operating volume basically yes that
thing will be screaming because you see
there in those thin and light machines
that have not particularly good coolers
but you know you can chuck on external
calls and that sort of thing to help out
a little bit but yeah so certainly I
would think in a lot of cases it
probably is worth going for max Q even
though it gets a bad name simply because
of that extra potential it has and yeah
I find clock speeds to fluctuate quite a
lot you can get games that are much
closer to 10 70 and then games is a sort
of much closer to 1060 level it just
depends I found that testing a wide
range of games power draw will vary yeah
a bit from one game to another that's
why I still stick with Crysis 3 yeah
that's a pretty good I mean it's
basically a 1070 with a much harsher
power and that's basically abilities
okay alright next question this is more
of a technical question awesome but
would you be able to put a number on the
difference in performance between a core
and a thread is it application specific
yes I believe so does the speed vary
between Intel hyper-threading and AMD's
SMT so they're both SMT technology
technologies or implementations but the
word was not coming into my head anyway
easy Intel's model of dropping HT below
the eye 9 a sustainable idea ok let's
work it on these one at a time I believe
under optimal conditions which is
application specific that
hyper-threading adds about a 25%
performance boost per call or to the
core that seem to be alone you've seen
testing SMT I don't exactly know it's
sort of it's sort of all over the place
like sometime
it really hurts performance I mean
hyper-threading does as well but
developers have had more time to
optimize for it or take it into account
whereas AMD's implementation of SMT not
so much but then we've seen examples
like 7-zip decompression even Cinebench
other rendering applications where SMT
is more a bit more beneficial than hyper
threading I couldn't give you an exact
figure over 25% yeah that would take
some testing which I haven't really done
maybe someone else out there has but I
don't have any good numbers off the top
of my head we know with hyper threading
cuz we've tested you know your core i5s
versus i7s over the years and it's about
25% when hyper threading has been
utilized very well is Intel's model of
dropping HT below the eye 9 a
sustainable idea well they're fairly
done well we haven't had that many
processors released in the the next
generation the coffee leg refresh and I
haven't done a whole lot of 9700 K
testing either but I mean you still get
a calls eight threads so I guess if it's
competitive at that price point then
it's a sustainable idea what do you
think yeah I don't think so I mean the
thing is intel still making those CPUs
with hyper-threading available in the
core they're just disabling it sure so I
still think that you know they're not
going to create an architecture that
doesn't have you know hypothermia
actually is a performance improvement
but yeah I wouldn't be surprised if in a
future generation they bring bring that
segmentation back to have like eight
cores eight threads eight core 16
threads maybe have you six core 12
thread who knows next question this is a
mortal one but I think I could probably
answer this one well then fashion I'll
take it anyway
do I need a g-sync monitor for gtx 1072
or as a 144 freesync monitor adaptive
sync monitor and will that do just fine
need to save money I would guess that if
you're playing up at those high refresh
sorry those we have at those high
refresh rates those high frame rates as
well as going to go for that would be
absolutely fine that you don't need
g-sync
yeah
to people while I've sort of experienced
I think I've mentioned this a few times
that adaptive sink is most useful
between your sort of 40 to 75 80 ish fps
that's where you sort of noticed that
the stuttering you're more likely to
notice screen tearing and that sort of
thing we play in that zone
where's if you up at the upper end of
your mana you're buying 140 foot smaller
so I'm assuming you want those you want
to be playing up at that high end of
that zone so like 100 plus fps honestly
the difference between say vsync off and
adaptive sync not that big it depends
how noticeable you find tearing yep and
then vsync on yeah you probably see
maybe bit of stuttering but it's
definitely not as noticeable as when
you're playing those lower frame rate so
in my opinion it almost costs twice as
much to buy a monitor with g-sync in it
these days that $200 premium with
monitor prices lowering so much that
$200 premium can be like half the cost
of the monitor so in my eyes is just
simply not worth it in any sense
so no it's not it's it's yeah it's
definitely not worth it and then like as
we say who knows what AMD's doing next
year next GPU upgrade next crappy an
upgrade maybe an AMD one so yep second
last question we still have the sounds
of nature going full ball out there yeah
I wonder I wonder how loud that is on
the microphone it's good main channel
sort of soundtrack anyway second last
question and I'm just gonna hand this
one straight over to Tim because he's
the news corner guy all right what do
you think the performance of Navi will
be in your opinion do you think it
stands a chance against RT x20 atti
you asking me to get my crystal ball out
again here is he's my is my 20 foot pole
yeah yeah I mean simple fact is we don't
know what do we think the performance
will be I mean we would like it to be up
near 20 atti that'd be great better than
a 28 you either be amazing
I think we have to temporary
expectations though because when I when
it comes to AMD GPU yeah I have no
expectations now that mean that in a
negative way I just mean
be anything and I'm willing to wait in
bench market and see yeah so I think
they're coming from a long long way back
when you look at how Vegas it could be
for their current flagship you know Vega
GPU competes with the 2080 I it gets
absolutely destroyed and that's on
current process technologies we're
talking you know in videos on 12
nanometer
Ami's on 40 nanometer so when it comes
to Navi being competitive they not only
need to make a product that bridges the
gap from Vegas 64 220 ATI which is
massive massive gap they also need to
make it better than a 20 80 TI so that
when nvidia comes out with their 7
nanometre product it doesn't immediately
get trounced again so that's a really
really tough ask for AMD to make a GPU
design and completely overhaul that
architecture to the point where they can
bridge that gap that's like what 70 80 %
from a vague by how much fast is a 20 80
I over Vegas 64 7 on average yeah be
somewhere around the Huracan yes so
we're talking Nvidia that needs to have
a 70% gain from the architecture
effectively and then on top of that they
need to produce more games because of 7
animators so that when Nvidia comes
along again they don't get destroyed so
will there be able to do that that
certainly is asking a very very yeah GPU
team if we wanted to be reasonable I
suppose or if I had to predict yeah I
wouldn't I would sort of say that 2080
would be a better target
yeah well I mean that's only 10 atti
performance that's been around for a
while I think I honestly think like
maybe they won't have their flagship GPU
outperform a 2082 i7 nanometers but I
think it would be reasonable to expect
2080 type performance for less well I
was but that was what I meant sort of
worst case I honestly don't know buy
again yeah we don't really we don't know
and I just yeah I just want a benchmark
when it comes out yeah I don't want to
guess too much so last question is
it's the end of the year what were your
most exciting Tecmo moments in 2018 and
what a most looking forward to in 2019
same question regarding the channel and
the future of the channel okay it's
pretty good set of questions there I
could never do this on the spot I guess
one thing that comes to mind that always
makes me chuckle and laugh was a joke
video on the GTX 20/80 and and and
seeing how that has played out it kind
it's kind of funny it's even funnier now
watching it I reckon was our worst
received video ever yep
ever by a country mile we'll try and
remember to link that in the G that
people really did not get the joke they
didn't get the joke but I really enjoyed
making that video it still makes me
laugh today I think it's ridiculously
obvious that was satire I didn't think
that needed to be explained at all but
apparently even explaining it don't snot
funny okay but no I really enjoyed that
that was very funny very fun maybe it's
just me laughing at my own jokes but hey
yeah that was pretty good the whole
lead-up to the r-tx series was yeah it
was a bit of fun with all the joking
around about the ridiculous rumors and
then the product comes out disappointing
ray-tracing was certainly interesting
yeah I mean there was a lot of
disappointing things like there was the
spectrum meltdown patches and exciting
things off the very start of the year
where the GPP thing you know
disappointing r-tx launched with the
ray-tracing and all that that came with
that we have the principal technologies
report on the 900k
gamers nexus made a t-shirt or something
yeah yeah their labels of fails yeah
that's actually a really awesome looking
t-shirt so I recommend checking that out
I think they're mostly sold out now it's
a limited run but that was a very very
cool t-shirt so I'm probably sure to try
to get my hands on one of those be I
recommend checking out the game as an
extra store if you want to see a shirt
that encapsulates all those are pointing
all the disappointing things
after 2018 yeah the most exciting
moments there hasn't been that product
this year that's just been like
amazingly good like a bit follow that
like I was super excited for the 2990 WX
and then it was a big fail on Windows
yeah and products like you know the
risin 520 600 that released and it was
pretty good but it only became really
good when the prices started to drop at
the end of the year yeah same with your
rx 585 seventies yeah after that's not
really as much of it there's definitely
something we're overlooking yeah you've
got nothing else no no okay okay well
we'll stick with my silly joke video of
the GTX 2080 that became the RT X 28
okay and then the next part that
question is I suppose the second part
it's a three parter what are we most
looking forward to in 2019 well I think
for me it's pretty obvious it's the
seven nanometer tech mostly from AMD I
probably most looking forward to the
CPUs I think but CPUs GPUs obviously is
a big deal as well that's probably the
thing I'm most excited for next year
about you I'm slightly different I'm
most excited about AMD's GPUs if I was
going to choose an area private I think
Rison is quite competitive now but
there's so far back in GPUs have been
interesting to see what happens there
and I'm very interested to see Intel 10
nanometers I think we sort of have a
reasonable idea of what's possible with
seven animators from AMD and their CPUs
and their the architecture but I think a
lot of people have been prematurely
killing off Intel and I'm very
interested to see what they can do in
2019 to sort of get rid of that
perspective about the company because I
think they might have a few tricks up
their sleeve to make to make everything
more competitive and if there's more
competition then you know when when
Intel's be at the forefront forever we
don't really want AMD to be the
forefront with no competition either we
want good competition because that makes
the best products yes all around yep
okay
same questions regarding the channel and
the future of the channel so one of the
most exciting moments for the channel
issue I think for me was probably
building a patreon account we're really
focused on that
this year for the first time ever yeah
I've got a really good community that
it's actually it's gone from a point
really where you know I was getting you
know a lot of tech news and stuff from
just like reading websites or browsing
reddit browsing Twitter that sort of
thing but now the disco community that
was sort of built for hardware and box
dude is really a great place to chat
about all these new things that come out
and they usually are posting about and
using the stuff which makes it easy for
us to keep up with that and it's just
it's such a friendly and nice community
to talk with where you know you get to
read it in this sometimes a lot of that
even YouTube cars as well you know a lot
of fanboy arguments and that sort of
thing rose I prefer you know it's good
way to escape it's a more a more
measured in and sort of reasonable
discussion measured more mature yeah so
no I really like that about about the
discordant yeah I think that's probably
the most exciting thing for me this year
to do with the channel I mean the growth
as well we've doubled our subscriber
count for example which has been
phenomenal
yes yeah it's been a big eyes has been
fantastic and then the future of the
channel well we just want to keep
working hard on the channel I think it's
I don't think it's possible to work
harder or spend more time I think that's
impossible but I think it's better to do
better yeah so with the time that we do
put into it yeah yeah you have to do
things and yep so yeah just make every
aspect of it better we want to do a
merch store next year get some stone at
early 2019 it will probably start off
fairly basic but then we'll get him with
benchmarking meme new shirts going you
guys have been requesting the merch
store for the best part of the year yeah
very much we get requests all the time
for t-shirts mugs mouse pads mouse pads
whatever we're working on it it's in it
is in the plan it is coming at some
point hopefully next year I think it's
fair to say we're thinking about it what
you think about it but happy talking you
know it's it's one of our things that
we're planning for next year so that's
that's something for next year planning
obviously we want to continue the growth
you know just all that generic stuff
like making the content better which is
obviously what we're always striving to
do yeah we want to keep the content
still the stuff that you guys like we're
not really interested in branching
- do you know more mainstream I'll make
or take the channel from enthusiasts to
you know make into Elias tech tips or
something we're not really yeah not as
interested in doing that we want to keep
it on stuff that we enjoy doing and what
we cover now is what we enjoy doing so
yep that's not going to change hopefully
it's a good year next year there should
be plenty of good tech first - Cowboys
enjoy those big slugs where the day 1
reviews and we've do nothing but stay up
and benchmark and test for days on end
so plenty of that next year so that'll
be good and next year's releases are
looking like they're going to be a lot
better than this year's yes so yeah this
year was very disappointing a little
weak but yep so yes very much it all
right and that's it for the December QA
Thanks to everyone who managed to watch
through all of both videos Subban hours
worth of questions then if you have a
lot of fun coming out here for this one
definitely so worth it even if I had the
wrong shirt for the event everybody nuts
at - many viewers yeah you have to are
not stuff it up next time single colors
I've got to keep it simple keep it
simple at we 19 yeah yeah I guess you
know if you like these views you can
always give it a thumbs up subscribe for
more typical hard room box content other
benchmark stuff the stuff you guys like
and yeah I guess we'll catch you in a QA
again in 2019 yeah should be good
