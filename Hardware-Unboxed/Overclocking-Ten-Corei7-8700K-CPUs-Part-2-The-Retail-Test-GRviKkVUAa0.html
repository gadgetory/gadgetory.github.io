tested all ten retail core i7 87
hurricane processors and it's now time
to go over the results if you missed
yesterday's video then check that first
as it provides a bit more of an
explanation of what we're doing here
basically though when reviewers like
myself checked out the core i7 87 okay
for the first time around six months ago
now we were all or rather most of us
were impressed with the overclocking
capabilities most reviewers hit 5.1
gigahertz using around 1.3 5 to 1 point
4 volts but reported scorching hot
temperatures at this frequency
temperatures that were hell into the 90s
half-a-dozen reviewers including myself
push things to their limits and managed
5.2 gigahertz these are obviously very
good chips but again they did run super
hot at that frequency and would require
deleting for long term usage quite a few
reviewers though were limited to 5
gigahertz and well you could speculate
as to why that was stuff like they
didn't push hard enough they were happy
with 5 gigahertz and just stopped there
or whatever other story you can come up
with I'm no pro overclocking though I've
certainly never claimed to be on the
channel and for the most part
overclocking doesn't really excite me
much these days
now that said hitting 5.2 gigahertz on
my review sample was extremely easy and
I didn't say with very little effort I'd
say most of the reviewers that were
limited to 5 gigahertz know at least as
much as I do when it comes to
overclocking in fact I'd say most of
them probably enjoyed tinkering with
this stuff more than I do and possibly
have more experience I guess what I'm
saying is if I can do it I'm confident
they can as well and I'm certain they
would have as a side note I was able to
boot into Windows a five point three
gigahertz with my sample from Intel but
I wasn't able to complete any tests I've
since spent quite a few hours with a few
different high-end motherboards and
despite temperatures remaining quite
reasonable even with dangerous voltages
I haven't been how to stabilize the chip
at that frequency it seems to be able to
do 5.2 you can Hertz with ease 5.3
gigahertz though seems to be just out of
reach anyway despite a mixed range of
frequencies from reviewers there's
always claims of samples being
cherry-pick so I decided to look into
this
further supporting this endeavor is pck
skier who handed over 10 brand-new
unused car I 787 here ok retail boxes
for testing so I've spent the last three
days swapping 8700 KS in and out of the
test bed to find the maximum stable
frequency each chip is capable of
none of the CPUs in this test have been
deleted including my samples from Intel
and asrock for testing I'm using the
gigabyte Z 370 or s gaming 7 motherboard
and for cooling I have the thermal tape
Pacific our 360 d5 liquid cooling kit
for this one I'm just sticking with
basic multiplier overclocking so no
adjustments have been made to the base
clock and in order to validate each
overclock I'm running a blender workload
which takes daily 700k a little over an
hour to complete so no it's not a 24
hour extreme stress test I just don't
have over a week to invest in this video
right now certainly not with second gen
rise and CPUs knocking anyway this is
still a very heavy workload and chances
are if it can survive this it's really
good for any gaming session you can
throw at it
ok so starting with my Intel review
sample which we know is a beast and I
wouldn't for a second argue this isn't
top grade silicon using just one point
three seven volts in the bias it manages
a rock-solid at five point two gigahertz
overclock under load hardware info
reports drawing up to one point three
nine two volts and peaking at 91 degrees
which is obviously very hot and for
prolonged use you will need to deal with
this thing it also pushed total system
consumption at 275 watts
based on an average of six passes we
recorded a multi-threaded Cinebench
score of sixteen hundred and sixty three
points and a corona benchmark completion
time of one hundred and twenty-two
seconds in comparison the sample
provided by asrock which has a slightly
different batch number isn't quite as
good although it managed the same 5.2
gigahertz overclock it did require more
voltage and therefore did consume more
power and ran a tad hotter now time for
the first retail chip and this one
managed 5.1 gigahertz at a very
reasonable 1.3 eight volts which saw the
system consumed 266 Watts under load and
maxed out at 88 degrees in terms of
performance it was very close to the
eyes rock sample despite being 100
megahertz down though of course we are
only talking a 2% reduction in frequency
I was able to load into windows at 5.2
gigahertz but even with 1.4
to five volts it wasn't completely
stable therefore while not as good as
the samples that I got from asrock and
Intel this retail ship is still very
good moving on we have retail chip
number two and we find a very similar
result 5.1 gigahertz but this chip did
require a bit more voltage and this
increased the power consumption and
familes a little further and this chip
wasn't able to even load windows at 5.2
gigahertz no matter how much voltage we
gave it then retail chips three four and
five are all limited to just five
gigahertz with around 1.3 five volts I
could have done a bit more voltage
tuning here to be honest but I was
mostly focused on the frequency all
three could load windows at 5.1
gigahertz using 1.4 to 5 volts but
stability wasn't 100% they did appear
stable at 1.4 5 volts but temperatures
were getting well into the 90s like very
high nineties almost knocking on a
hundred degrees and that is without open
a loop system so without a dealer these
results are unacceptable in my opinion
retail chips 6 7 and 8 were all much the
same hitting 5.1 gigahertz a stable 5.1
hurts though they did require over 1.4
volts to do that and therefore power
consumption a thermal output was quite
high so again good overclock is but
there clearly not as good as my Q s
sample finally though I did have my
first real win when I got to chip number
9 this one was very similar to the Q s
chip provided by asrock
I managed 5.2 gigahertz with the v core
set to one point 4 volts and the bias
and performance was identical to that of
the chip provided by Intel that said the
voltage was much higher and this
increased power draw and thermal output
quite substantially then last but not
least we have retail chip number 10 and
this was another 5.1 gigahertz chip that
required just over one point four volts
so not as good as the Q s samples but
still quite a good retail chip then
wrapping up the testing just out of
interest sake I decided to install each
CPU again load the BIOS defaults and
then enable multi-core enhancement as
well as XMP then I ran the tests again
monitoring things like the frequency
voltages power consumption and
temperatures all 12 CPUs hit 4.7
gigahertz on all calls for both the
tests and performance varied by no more
than a single percent which I'd say is
margin of error even for a 6 run average
again we see that my sample from Intel
was a little
you're running quite a few degrees
cooler than the retail CPUs and despite
hitting a similar or even higher maximum
vehicle and maybe the heat spreader on
this chips pressed down a little harder
or something overall we had just one of
the 10 retail chips that could do 5.2 G
Hertz six that did 5.1 gigahertz and
obviously there were three that did five
gigahertz but of course there was
nothing worse than that so overall I was
a bit disappointed not to see at least
one other chip capable of 5.2 gigahertz
but I suppose at least we've got no
lemons so overall probably a pretty good
result there honestly though the results
I found with these 10 retail chips
really aren't that different to what the
tech media found in fact overall I'd say
they're actually a little bit better and
while I wouldn't dare say that you're
guaranteed 5 gigahertz if you were to
buy one of these ten chips then you
would have achieved at least five
gigahertz and while some reviewers that
were given chips by Intel didn't even
get that and we are talking about
seasoned highly experienced tech guys
you know guys like Steve from gamers
Nexus I know if I were going to spend
loads of time and energy sifting through
hundreds if not thousands of CPUs to
find the golden eggs I'd be sending them
to guys it'll get the most out of them
whatever the case what these results
mean and what they are by no means are
conclusive but what they should indicate
is that you have an extremely good
chance of getting an 87 here okay that
will do at least 5 gigahertz of course
even for a 5 gigahertz overclock you
will require a high-end air cooler or a
liquid cooler with at least a 240
millimeter radiator and for best results
you will need to deal it and well I've
given my strong and negative opinion on
this subject several times before on the
channel in a nutshell I find it
unacceptable the Intel forces are those
who purchase their expensive unlocked
CPUs to spend even more money and time
deal letting them just so they can
achieve acceptable operating
temperatures but that's an entirely
different issue so let's not get into
that here things to look out for in
reviews that include overclocking is
stuff like power consumption and
thermals when overclocked
as well as take note of the motherboard
and cooler used for my review I used the
extreme and very good MSI Zed 370 GOG
like with a 2
and 40-millimeter all-in-one liquid
cooler and I had this to say with a room
temperature of 21 degrees the 8700 K
titled 25 degrees stressing both the CPU
and FPU course temperatures 84 degrees
while only stressing the CPU saw
temperatures max out at 60 degrees once
I have a clock to 5.2 gigahertz we reach
within six degrees of the t.j.maxx while
running the CPU stress test peaking at
97 degrees briefly obviously a deal it
would help tremendously for those
seeking extreme overclock and or a more
extreme cooling solution so basically
what this means unless you're willing to
deal with the 87 ROK and couple it with
an expensive cooler you aren't running
over 5 gigahertz even if you do win the
silicon lottery whether or not Intel is
cherry-picking review samples honestly I
still don't know I got lucky for sure
but there are those that didn't for me
though the evidence so far probably
suggests that they're not but if you
believe they are based on the evidence
at hand then you'd also have to strongly
believe that AMD did exactly the same
thing with Rison whatever the case it's
hardly the biggest con job in the world
if they did in fact cherry-pick them and
reviewers mostly show 5 to 5 point 1
gigahertz with a few showing 5.2
gigahertz then based on the evidence in
this video if you were to buy them off
the shelf you'd likely see at least 5
gigahertz maybe five point one and
possibly five point two so yeah big deal
about nothing probably if the average
retail CPU did let's say four point
seven to four point eight you can Hertz
maybe even four point nine gigahertz
then sure that's a bit of a problem but
with five gigahertz looking almost
guaranteed assuming have a good
motherboard and cooling then it's hard
to see what all the fuss is about
finally as I said earlier the results
from our 10 retail CPUs are by no means
conclusive I really looked at batch l7
33 and even then there's a chance you
could get a cpu from this batch to do
four point nine gigahertz or you could
get one that'll do five point two
gigahertz or maybe even better again
silicon lottery and that is going to do
it for this video really big thank you
