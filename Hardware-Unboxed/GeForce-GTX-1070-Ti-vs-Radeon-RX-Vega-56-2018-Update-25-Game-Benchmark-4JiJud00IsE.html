are revisiting the battle between the
geforce gtx 1070 TI and Radeon rx mega
56 now I realize is probably not that
many of you that are super excited about
graphics cards right now at least the
ones we currently have on sale and that
is because they're still quite
overpriced perhaps more importantly they
are old and about to be replaced
despite that though I wanted to provide
some updated results especially since I
haven't done any in-depth GeForce vs.
Radeon comparisons in 2018 yet both
Nvidia and AMD have released a number of
driver updates this year which improved
performance or at least have claimed to
though most of those claims have been
for games that have been released this
year also so game ready drivers in other
words that said there I'm still really
Cana see if much or anything has changed
in the last 6 months with the battle
between these two particular GPUs last
time out 35 games were tested at 3
resolutions though the focus was mostly
on the 1440p numbers and here the gtx
1072 i was 6 percent faster when
comparing these stock out-of-the-box
performance for this update we have 25
games all of which had been tested
exclusively at 1440p I will be testing
both GPUs stock as well as overclocked
so it will be interesting to see if aim
DS made up any ground here for this
comparison I will be using our standard
core i7 8700 K GPU test system clocked
at 5 units along with 32 gigabytes of
ddr4 3,200 memory representing the green
team is the msi gtx 1070 TI gaming ex
and for the red team while the red team
themselves with their reference vega 56
model because i don't seem to be able to
get anyone to send me a custom-designed
vega graphics card so with that let's
get to the results first up we have the
Assassin's Creed origins results and
here Vega 56 takes a bit of a pounding
the 1% low figure was 18% lower out of
the box and that margin was only reduced
to 16 percent once overclocked the
average frame rate was a little more
competitive but still not a good result
for the
team here next up we have ARMA 3 and
here Vega 56 does do quite well edging
out the gtx 1070 TI both stock and
overclocked not huge margins by any
means but the radio and GPU was seen to
be up to 5% faster moving on the Star
Wars Battlefront to the game that
grossly missed sales targets and EA
blamed the poor performance on the loot
crate controversy
I wonder if Disney can use that excuse
for solo anyway despite poor sales
battlefront 2 is actually a really fun
game and a really well-made game at that
and it plays really well on both AMD and
NVIDIA hardware stock performance was
much the same while the GTX 1070 TI
managed a 5% win once overclocked before
everyone jumped ship to battlefield 5 in
October we've still got time to feature
battlefield 1 and a few more videos yet
this is another example of a well made
title and again we see very competitive
performance that said the radeon GPU was
able to deliver higher frame rates and
both stock and overclocked though the
overclocked numbers were very similar
please note for Deus Ex mankind Nevada
we're not using the built-in benchmark
and while the GTX 1070 TI
has been tested using DirectX 11 Vega 56
has been tested using DX 12 again we see
very competitive performance out of the
box Vega 56 was up to 7 percent faster
but just 3 percent faster once both GPUs
were overclocked moving on we have some
rallycross action with dirt 4 and we say
that Vega 56 has gone full ken block
Gymkhana mode on the gtx 1070 TI as it
drifts circles around the GeForce GPU
increasing the anti-aliasing mode - MS
AAA does heavily reduce the margin seen
here using CMAA but you do get much
better frame rates with both GPUs using
this method while the visual quality
isn't noticeably different with both
GPUs overclocked to Vega 56 was 37%
faster for the frame timer result and
17% faster for the average frame rate
don't expect to see margins like this
too often but still a great result for
the red team next up we have f1 2017 and
here the GeForce GPU had no trouble
finding the racing line and with maximum
grip was able to edge out Vega 56
delivering around 10% more performance
both stock and over
clopped if harbor unboxed was like far
cry 5 we take you on an awesome
benchmark adventure then just randomly
interrupt you with unrelated content
before knocking you out cold and having
your wakeup in a wooded location
thankfully though harbor unboxed isn't
like far cry 5 so getting back to it
here we see out of the box that value 56
was a little faster but the margin was
closed at once both GPUs were
overclocked so competitive performance
in this title next up we have everyone's
favorite new cartoon series fortnight
well everyone except for AMD the Unreal
Engine really is a big middle finger to
AMD but at least Verizon is starting to
perform a little better in this title
the Radeon GPUs though are still well
down on where you'd probably expect them
to be and as a result the GTX 1072 I was
up to 27% faster frost Punk is one of
the newest titles that we've tested with
and it's fair to say this one doesn't
play too nicely with AMD Hardware out of
the box the GTX 970 I was 26% faster for
the average framerate and then once
overclocked extended that lead out to a
whopping 41%
moving on to grand theft auto 5 and well
no surprises here
upon release Vega 56 was basically only
on par with an overclocked GTX 1060 and
today we see that little improvement
appears to have been made this means the
GTX 1072 I was anywhere from 25 to 40%
faster
hitman is another title we've tested
using DirectX 11 for NVIDIA and DirectX
12 for AMD stock the GTX 1072 I was 9
percent faster but once both GPUs buy
overclocked that margin was reduced to
just 4% another total released this year
is Kingdom Come deliverance and here we
see very competitive performance out of
the box
however the geforce gtx 1070 is superior
overclocking header and pushes ahead by
a 9% margin once both GPUs are fully
wound up fans of project cars will want
a GeForce GPU and although these second
installment in this series hasn't been
as brutal as the first for AMD it's
still pretty bad here the GTX 1072 I was
17% faster out of the box and then 21%
faster once overclocked so complete and
utter track domination for the Green
Team out of the box we see pretty
competitive performance in
the GTX 1072 I was 8% faster here though
that's not nearly as significant as the
17% performance advantage and enjoys
once overclocked last time out pub she
provided the GTX 1072 I with its biggest
win since then the game has left early
access and it seems support for AMD GPUs
has drastically improved although the
GTX 1072 I was still 11% faster out of
the box previously we found it to be 28%
faster admittedly though we're not
testing the exact same section of the
game but six months ago
AMD was a lot slower in every section of
the game that we looked into the GTX
1072 eye does extend its lead to 15
percent once overclocked but still this
time around we do see very respectable
performance from the vega 56 graphics
card
moving on quake champions uses the
DirectX 11 API sir tons very nicely on
NVIDIA hardware and here we see the gtx
1070 TI providing 12% more frames when
stock and 13% more once overclocked then
we have Rainbow six siege and as you
might have expected neither GPU has an
issue in this title at 1440p using the
ultra quality settings that said the gtx
1070 TI had to be overclocked to match
the stock vega 56 card while
overclocking produced a further 7
percent performance Sniper Elite 4 was
tested exclusively using the DirectX 12
API and here the GTX 1072 I had a slight
performance advantage delivering 4% more
frames out of the box and 8% more once
overclocked in case you're wondering
here's the six last game tested not sure
why I pointed that out so let's just
move along Middle Earth shadow of Warsaw
the GTX 1072 I delivered just four
percent more frames on average when
stock and surprisingly once overclocked
of both GPUs to the exact same result
for gamers wanting to put those 50
million mouse-click claims to the test I
recommend checking out vermintide 2 then
for the smoothest experience you will
want the geforce gtx 1070 TI though i
should note that vega 56 does also do
very well and was just seven percent
slower out of the box
still overclocked the GeForce GPU did
provide 10 percent more performance and
that will certainly come in handy as you
madly click away like a Red Bull and
fuse toddler playing minecraft for a
different kind of Warhammer
spirits we have total war Warhammer 2
and for this title we've used the
DirectX 11 API here the gtx 1070 TI was
only a smidgen faster out of the box but
was 9% faster once both GPUs were
overclocked almost wrapping things up we
have Ghost Recon wildlands and here the
GTX 1072 I'm Vega 56 GPUs do go
toe-to-toe in their stock out of the box
configuration that said as we often find
once overclocked the gtx 1070 Ti has the
upper hand and here it was now 9% faster
second last game tested The Witcher 3
and we have hair works enabled but not
maxed out for those glorious
free-flowing Tech Jesus locks both stock
GPUs average 60 FPS and then again we
see comparable performance when
overclocked so a very even battle indeed
NVIDIA has made a number of performance
improvements in 2017 s Wolfenstein - the
new Colossus upon release Vega 56 was
able to beat the GTX 1080 in this Vulcan
based game today though it's a very
different story
performance is now far more competitive
and shockingly the gtx 1070 Ti is now a
little faster than Vega 56 so Nvidia
really has made great strides in this
title of course nothing has changed when
it comes to power consumption but here
are the numbers anyway for those of you
who missed the original content stock we
see that Vega 56 pushed total system
consumption 9% higher which isn't that
significant however once overclocked the
results are very significant and
incredibly value 56 is now pushing total
system consumption 29% higher this is
why Vega 56 owners prefer to undervolt
Vega to save power while achieving stock
like the performance okay so we just saw
a classic bit of AMD Nvidia back and
forth and we do know based on testing
done six months ago that the gtx 1070 TI
is the faster of these two graphics
cards but the question is has that
margin changed today
to find out let's take a quick look at
the average performance from the 25
games tested okay so not a lot has
changed
this time the gtx 1070 - I was 5% faster
not a huge margin by any means again we
say the real advantage of the gtx 1070
eye is the overclocking Headroom and
with
both overclocked to the max the GeForce
GPU was now 8 percent faster here's a
quick look at how they stack up in the
25 games tested in stock trim the gtx
1070 T I enjoyed big wins in frost Punk
GTA 5 fortnight and project cars - while
it was only notably slower in dirt 4 and
rainbow 6 siege and I suppose the good
news for Nvidia here being that frame
rates are still exceptionally high in
those titles anyway overclocked things
look much the same the GTX 1072 eyes
lead overall is just extended a little
further
here it's now 8 percent faster on
average at the 1440p tested resolution
granted 8% isn't a huge margin and the
margin itself doesn't really mean that
much without a price attached to it in a
fantasy land where graphics cards could
be had 4 or at least near the MSRP the
GTX 1072 I would cost 13 percent more
than the Vega 56 graphics card and
technically that does make AMD's product
the better value buy anyway because we
unfortunately live in the real world or
a matrix type simulation whichever you
prefer
neither the gtx 1070 TI nor Vega 56 are
available at the MSRP that has to be
said prices are improving particularly
for the geforce models a graphics card
sporting the geforce gtx 1070 TI GPU can
be had for just under $500 us right now
though most are priced a little above
$500 us still that's only about 50
dollars over the suggested price and
compared to where we have been recently
that's pretty good unfortunately though
vega 56 pricing still high as a kite and
getting one for $500 us would be
considered a real treat at the time
making this video there is just a single
card selling for under $600 us with
everything else priced above so if
you're going after a more high-end type
graphics card the geforce gtx 1070 to it
really is the best option right now of
course this video was more about what if
any steps AMD or nvidia has made over
the past six months with their drivers
and overall things appear to be much the
same it is difficult though to do a
direct comparison as the testing
hardware has changed a little and many
of the games have been patched and
upgraded multiple times and of course so
has Windows 10 not to mention all the
security updates which
have impacted performance hopefully
we'll know very soon what's on the way
from Nvidia and fingers crossed we learn
something this week at Computex if
you're watching this video as it went
live there is a good chance I'm on a
plane headed for Taiwan at the moment
and the next few days we'll know what if
anything Nvidia is announcing at
Computex so stick around for that news
and that is going to do it for this one
