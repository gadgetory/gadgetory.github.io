months ago you might remember we first
put nvidia support for free sync models
to the test a winner got every free sync
honor I had in the office hooked it up
to a collection of NVIDIA GPUs and
verified that in all cases adaptive sync
worked as expected with an NVIDIA GPU
and these monitors well LG saw that
video noticed we didn't test any LG
monitors so they sent me an email asking
if I wanted to test five of their latest
free sync gaming monitors to check out
whether they to work within the video
GPUs I thought well you know why not we
haven't reviewed any LG monitors on a
channel in the past and this is a great
opportunity to revisit in video support
for free sync with the collection of Nu
and in some cases quite popular gaming
displays as a quick refresher with a
driver update almost two months ago in
video open up support for the Vaser
adaptive sync
aka free sync standard with their Pascal
and newer graphics cards invidious
current GPU architectures have always
had the ability to drive adaptive sync
displays it's effectively how g-sync
works in laptops but for desktop cards
it was locked down so Nvidia could focus
on their chasing to monitor ecosystem
since the update what we're left with
now is a multi tier monitor ecosystem
for NVIDIA GPU owners at the top we have
the monitors that reach a custom J sync
module branded as either G sync or HDR
monitors chasing ultimate then below
that we have Jason compatible these are
adaptive sync monitors nvidia has
certified to work properly with their
GPUs they have almost the same feature
set as full juicing displays and they
will have adaptive sync enabled out of
the box however there's also an option
in the Nvidia control panel to enable
adaptive sync on any free sync monitor
regardless of whether it's been
certified or not so you really don't
need to go out of your way to buy a
Jason compatible monitor because any
free sync display should work fine and
that's what we showed you in our
previous video and what many of you guys
have been telling us in the comments of
course Nvidia did take the time when
introducing Jason compatible monitors to
blast the free sync ecosystem for having
all sorts of issues like blanking
flickering and so on but really these
are
problems with freesync their monitor
specific issues and if you encounter
them you should return the display
NVIDIA suggested that their
compatibility certification process was
necessary to ensure you don't end up
with these issues but from what we've
seen 99% of uncertified learners seem to
work perfectly fine the testing in
today's video is very straightforward I
plugged in all five of the LG monitors
into my test rig loaded up with an
NVIDIA GeForce r-tx 2080 TI one at a
time of course the next step was to
enable free sync in the monitors
settings all five displays came with
free sync disabled out of the box you
need to turn it on in the on screen
display for Nvidia to recognize it as an
adaptive sync monitor where possible I
used the extended free sync mode which
delivers the widest refresh rate range
LG actually notes this mode which is
almost a form of display overclocking
could cause flickering but I'll discuss
whether this was an issue when I go
through each model after enabling free
sync in the display settings from
they're unable to adaptive sink in the
Nvidia control panel then I was pretty
much good to go
all five monitors were recognized as
supporting adaptive sync by the GPU
after free sync was enabled so that's a
good sign and in case you're wondering
one of invidious requirements for
juicing compatible certification is to
have free sync enabled by default so I
suspect the reason these LG monitors
didn't immediately pass certification
was down to free sync being disabled out
of the box a bit of a nitpicker
requirement because it means many free
sync models fail certification despite
being otherwise perfect anyway let's go
through each monitor individually from
here and talk about whether I
encountered any issues with the displays
adaptive sync implementation on NVIDIA
GPUs basically what I was looking for
was to check whether there were any
flickering issues blanking refresh rate
inconsistencies and so on when adaptive
sync was activated in particular I was
interested in seeing how these monitors
behaved around potentially problematic
points such as below the minimum refresh
rate and transitioning in and out of the
refresh window the first moment to be
tested was the LG 32 G k-8 50 F a 32
inch flat VA panel with a 1440p
resolution and 144 Hertz maximum refresh
rate this is also a free sync to certify
displays supporting HDR with display HDR
400 certification
this monitor has a 52 144 Hertz refresh
window so it supports a crucial feature
called low framerate compensation or LFC
which essentially extends the adaptive
sink window down to one Hertz allowing
the monitor to have no minimum refresh
you'll only get a good fruit sync
experience with monitors that support
LFC so I'm glad to report LFC works fine
with this monitor and NVIDIA GPUs as
expected I encountered no other issues
with this display the transition inside
and out of the refresh window so around
that 45 to 55 Hertz range was them
perfectly without flickering or other
artifacts LFC is activated as expected
here and the monitor works with free
sync whether you have HDR enabled or
disabled so turning on HDR has no impact
on the adaptive sync experience a great
result and this is the model that I
think is great quality in general with a
top-notch beer panel plus I love that
it's flat the 24 GL 600 F is a more
basic gaming monitor in LG's lineup
featuring a 24 inch 1080p 144 Hertz TN
panel it's designed to slot into that
budget high refresh category again no
issues with this monitor it too supports
LFC and I saw no problems transitioning
in and out of the refresh window the
only minor concern I have here is this
is a monitor that does not come with a
display port cable in the box not a big
deal really as a display port cable
costs all of five bucks but if you use
the included HDMI cable you will not get
free sync support as NVIDIA GPUs don't
support free sync over HDMI /
DisplayPort though as expected there are
no issues here next up we have the 27 GK
750 F and this is a rare 27 inch 1080p
240 Hertz TM display normally only see
this refresh rate at 24 inches in size a
decent unit this one especially if you
want that super high refresh rate when
gaming this monitor feels really fast
and some of that is down to lightning
quick response times anyway
this isn't a review of the display but I
am happy to report it works perfectly
with adaptive sync on an Nvidia chip you
again it supports LFC with a 48 to 240
hertz refresh window and across the
entire refresh range everything is
handled well no flickering or anything
like that
the fourth display is the 32 GK 650 F so
it's almost the same monitor as the
- GK 850 F but without HDR support and
at a lower price tag to match it's still
a 32-inch 1440p 144 Hertz ba again with
the 50 to 144 Hertz refresh window you
guessed the - there are no issues with
this display either and with this
combination of specs you're getting a
great gaming experience if you can you
know drive it and have enough GPU
horsepower there certainly with the 2080
IO is using playing games and ultra
settings above a hundred FPS at 1440p
was a blast
the last display of this 5 is the 34 GK
950 F a 34 inch IPS ultra wide with a 34
40 by 1440 resolution 144 Hertz maximum
refresh rate and HDR support it's
another one that supports free sync -
although this isn't a feature you can
use within the video cheaper use you can
still use adaptive sync and HDR at the
same time you just kind of able free
sync - in games that support like
Assassin's Creed Odyssey as the feature
is exclusive to AMD GPUs again
Noah should you see whatsoever with
standard free sync like the other
monitors I've tested it - supports LFC
thanks to a 60 to 144 Hertz refresh
range and I didn't experience any
flickering or blanking problems either
below or above the minimum refresh I
also wanted to specifically check the
maximum refresh range here as well
because 144 Hertz is a step above the
120 and one hundred Hertz monitors we've
been seeing with similar specs lately
but even right up to 144 Hertz there
were no issues using the extended free
sync mode so as expected all five free
sync monitors work perfectly with the
NVIDIA GPU to provide a fluid adaptive
sync experience or a high refresh models
that support LFC so the experience is
really good here there's no abrupt
transition between free sync on and off
as your framerate drops its overall a
really smooth experience on all of these
displays had LG enabled free sync on
these monitors by default I believe they
would pass Jason compatible
certification but even though they are
not certified they still work perfectly
when you enable free sync and I'm sure
getting the hardware unbox your
certification will be good enough for
you guys anyway LG seems to have really
perfected their implementation of
precinct since the early days they were
one of the first manufacturers to jump
aboard the adaptive sync train and in
2019 their range has grown significant
to encompass lots of different models
even their new TVs for this year support
free sync over HDMI for AMD GPU owners
like I said in the original video on
this topic I think it's safe to say if
you purchase a new free sync model today
that it will work fine with NVIDIA GPUs
you definitely shouldn't expect to see
flickering or any other issues whether
you buy an LG monitor or something from
a different brand it's really only with
the very early older freesync models
that you might encounter some issues but
even then I haven't heard too many
reports of specific models consistently
not working my recommendation continues
to be to just buy a free sync monitor
and not bother with chasing and these
results from a great selection of LG
monitors just reinforces this I'm
actually looking forward to doing a full
review on some of these models in the
coming weeks so look out for those
because there might be a bit of an lg
monitor testing onslaught anyway that's
it for this one subscribe to hardware
