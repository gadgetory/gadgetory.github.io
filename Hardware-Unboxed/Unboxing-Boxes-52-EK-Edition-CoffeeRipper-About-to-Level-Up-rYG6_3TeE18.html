one of those days where you have plenty
of work to do but you just can't you up
there doing any of it thankfully I
really have those days but today is one
of them I just wasn't enjoying working
on the video that I had planned for
today just couldn't be bothered doing it
thankfully I have been rescued from
myself I had a knock on the door just a
moment ago and today's delivery I
included three rather large very heavy
packages and the words EK were on them
that's just what I have been waiting for
if you recall this big hunk of a
computer case landed on my desk back in
May when we checked out course as 1000d
and the plane at the time was to deck it
out top to bottom with a liquid cooling
gear and as you can see that hasn't
happened yet between now and then I've
been flat out with the day-to-day
operations the channel events like
Computex that popped up and took up a
bit of our time and of course I have to
keep Tim in line so just all the usual
stuff so I haven't revisited the coffee
Ripper build yes that's what I named it
if you missed the video because it does
have a 1950 X and an 8700 K in there so
yeah pretty interesting too and one
system that anyway timing couldn't be
better on this one as I said I've been
dragging my feet all morning I just
couldn't get into it just yet couldn't
bring myself to do as mint to be doing
but with all these liquid cooling bits
rocking up I've sort of got a bit
excited to check those out so I thought
rather than do what I meant to do today
let's open up these boxes and check out
all the gear that ek has set me because
it looks like there's a lot of gear
think rather than pile all this one to
the desk at once we're just going to go
through them one by one so we'll start
with this one here sort of a long ish
very heavy box so there could be a few
radiators in here fingers crossed let's
have a look I'm not gonna do my usual
silly unboxing thing or I tip things out
of boxes because all this stuff is far
too heavy expensive and yeah you don't
really want to be banging up your new
water-cooling here
so we'll be very careful with this sort
of stuff okay we've got a lot of
fittings on top put them down one of
those one of those and one of these all
right I don't think we will go over all
the fittings that I have here because it
looks like there's a lot of fittings
I might provide some close-up shots of
said fittings but yeah of course I'll
mix them all up here so that I have to
go searching through them all to find
what I need when I go to build yeah a
huge assortment here of fitting so they
look quite nice shiny good quality
fittings can't wait to try them out so
we have a little red box here and this
is the pump combo the ekx top of rivo d5
pwm pump however quickly or that this
should be one of two pumps that will be
going in the system okay so pretty pump
like typical sort of pump for these kind
of builds so yeah that's gonna do the
job nicely okay I think we need to go
into much more detail on that one just
yet I'll try and repackage all this
stuff so it doesn't get all mixed up
okay well if that was the pump this is
very likely the reservoir EK res x3 400
so probably a 400 mil long radiator is
will be found in here so there we go
there is one of what I believe will
probably be two radiators I'm not quite
sure what's been sent but that looks
really nice and that will fit in there
perfectly so hopefully we'll have two of
them so hour by side filled with some
type of liquid I'm not sure what liquid
we have we'll probably find out before
the end of this video so a bit of
mounting gear a couple of fittings and
whatnot and it also includes this cool
little ek
acrylic bit that you can put in the
bottom so if we unscrew that that should
just clip in like so and there you go so
that should look pretty cool
not sure if what configuration I'll go
with there but we'll find out at a later
date I'll put this back in
so we don't scuff it all up okay next up
what do we have here we've got two of
these now the ek cool stream XE 480
millimeter so that would be a quad 120
millimeter fan radiator so two of these
will be on the front of this case let's
have a look at one of them we probably
don't need to unbox both of them so I'll
move one that can stay there for now so
these are what made up the bulk of the
weight of that package they're very
heavy very thick radiators and obviously
very long so in the package we get some
allen keys and some screws I'm planning
on getting Corsair to send over another
batch of their ml series fans and buy
another batch I mean another I think
we're gonna go with 8 or 10 of the 120
millimeter fans and then another three
of the 140 millimeter fans so yeah a lot
more fans going because we gonna have a
push-pull configuration every radiator
not sure if we can see this on camera
but they're gonna go in they'll probably
be going in that away and like that and
it'll be another four fans on the other
side of the radiator pulling sucking the
air through it and then this little hard
drive enclosure thing will be removed so
yeah
cool-looking radiator very big very
heavy and should keep my thread Ripper
CPU very cool
okay so that is box number one down
let's go on to box number two
okay plenty more gear in this box to go
through we have the other reservoir
which I was expecting to get so we have
two of those so that is great that's
gonna look amazing in there we have just
fold my knife away so I don't
accidentally lose any fingers actually
I'll just get everything out of the box
first and we'll go over everything that
we have here the second pump same as the
first one it it will be used in one of
the loops it's gonna be two loops one
for one of the systems or possibly the
GPUs I don't really worked at how I'm
going to configure it but we're going to
have at least two graphics cards to cool
and two CPUs for so yeah it'll be
hanging one of the loops
moving right along okay got some nice
stuff here alright well let's start with
we'll start with the block for the 8700
K build now for the 8700 K portion of
the build we have the ek supremacy Evo
RGB water block and this has RGB
lighting and all kinds of nice stuff as
the name suggests included in the kits a
nice little tube there a thermal grizzly
so I will use that and then underneath
here we have the backplate for mounting
the block obviously and then the block
itself so it's got an acrylic top cover
if I can get it out of the plastic so
there we go hopefully you can see that
quite well
yeah looks really good it's gonna look
amazing a lit up though possibly right
got to see it that well behind the
graphics card which is a bit of a shame
but anyway I'll get some good shots of
it in action so you will be able to at
least see it yeah I imagine that's going
to look pretty cool I'm not sure what
liquid will be flowing through it but
whatever liquid will be fine flowing
through it
I'm not sure what liquid will be flowing
through it but whatever we have you'll
definitely be able to see it and
hopefully it does the RGB effects
justice and then on the back we have a
nice nickel plated copper base now for
the next water block for the thread
Ripper build and this is a mono block
again with some RGB effects or whatever
we have the MSI X 399 a carbon pro AC I
believe it is in there and I won't be
upgrading that board or anything like
that for thread Ripper - we'll just
stick with the 1950 X as the sort of
show system and this will be the water
block which goes over the giant thread
Ripper CPU so we've got great coverage
there and then it also covers the
motherboards of erm so that will be
oriented in that direction has thread
Ripper written up the side there which
will be RGB backlit yeah I think that
looks pretty awesome the base plate on
it's so large they had to use two please
remove before you stickers so yeah good
stuff looks like it'll be pretty easy to
install as wave we've got these
spring-loaded screws that are already
fitted to the block so you just put that
down screw them in and you should be
away so you're very keen to get that set
up it's gonna look fantastic
alright again you get some thermal
grizzly and all the necessary bits and
bobs for screwing it down but that is a
fantastic looking one over lock that one
then going in the very top of the case
on those three 140 millimeter fans we
have the ek cool stream seee 420 and
that is a triple 140 millimeter fan or
radiator Oh quick look at that so it's a
little bit thinner than the other two
radios going the front but there you
have it so that will be going up in the
top probably around that way but I
haven't worked any of that out yet but
it'll be going up there and then
there'll be another three 140 millimeter
fans underneath pushing here up through
the radiator that's likely how we
configured anyway again I haven't
thought all this through yet I've only
just got all the bits and pieces as you
can see but I draft at what I would
need to do the build or probably a bit
more than roughly bit anyway then for
the VGA blocks we'll start with this one
because this is for a Vega and we'll be
putting a vague think 64 graphics card
in on the thread Ripper system I can
open this some reason I don't seem to be
able to with that tearing apart there we
go
did it did it did it so we get some ek
thermal paste in this one and again all
the bits and pieces you'll need some
thermal pads which will go on things
like the vrm a modified backplate
because an outline maybe a single slot
card so you could change the back side
of the card if you wanted to and then
the star of the show the block so that
matches the mono block for the 1950 ex
really well on the MSI motherboard same
sort of theme instead of saying thread
refer that says Radeon so that's nice
and again you can see all the liquid
flowing through it and everything like
that so that is going to look absolutely
spectacular that will be sort of facing
that way so you're like you'll be able
to see the Radeon part fortunately won't
be able to see the friendly locks that's
a bit of a shame but still when we
install on the card you'll be able to
get a good look at it and it should look
pretty awesome then I'm going to change
up the GeForce graphics car we have here
we have the MSI trio GTX 1080i at the
moment and that card just has an
incredible air cooler or on it's a
really cool card and I do use that from
for testing from time to time so I wanna
be able to do that and whatever graphics
card I do put in this hard tube build
won't be coming out anytime soon
so I'm just going to put one of the EFI
cards I have I've got to 1080 Ti
foundation graphics cards so I will be
putting one of them in this build and it
will have this block go on it
and if I can get it out so similar sort
of things that this is a Geforce version
and as I said that I'll be going when I
founders Edition at GT X 1080 Ti and
that will be in full view so instead of
having that MSI card they will have that
there and I think that's going to look
pretty awesome pretty awesome indeed
well all this stuff from ek is a very
very impressive running out of room a
stack it then we have the last and
biggest box of them all so I feel like
we've got pretty much everything we just
about need apart from tubes and whatnot
but I've got most of the key components
but maybe they're something I'm
forgetting oh this is still heavy as
well
imma losing yeah I'm losing it there we
go we're back okay hard tubes fewer
those more boxes ah it looks like ek has
provided some fans for this build so
maybe I won't be using Corsair fans I'm
not sure what's gonna happen there
anyway we have some coolant which we
will check out in a moment well that
explains why this box was so much bigger
than I was expecting because we have we
have some fans we have some fans bear
with me for a moment
oh I can do it I can do it here we go
yeah I felt so good all right so we have
some PE t g tubing hopefully that's
enough should be enough I'm not sure
probably enough I always think I need
more than I do and then I end up with a
heap left over
um okay probably know what they're doing
so I'd say that's enough
as long as I don't screw anything up
they have a lot of confidence in me but
I've done a few of these builds before
and it hasn't been as much of a problem
so should be fine
fingers crossed okay so these are a bit
of a surprise I was not expecting them
to send a million and one fans right so
ek did not tell me or if they did I'm
sorry I missed it in the details but
yeah I wasn't aware they were sending so
many fans and they all of the
120-millimeter variety it's looking like
it yep so we have what do we got here
one two three four fourteen fifteen
sixteen so we have 16 120 millimeter ek
Vader evo RGB fans so these look pretty
awesome actually I probably should take
my on the box and have a good look at it
I'll get some b-roll of them in action
and put it in this video so at least you
can see what they look like when they're
all RG beat up okay so we've got a nice
square black frame we've got the PWM
power cable and then the RGB cable and
then the fans themselves are clear so
they should provide a pretty nice effect
they're actually very similar to the
Corsair ml fans that I'm currently using
in the build yeah anyway I'm not sure
what I will be doing there for the fan
configuration I'll have to work that out
but anyway thank you for saying the fans
and if I don't use them in this bill
they will definitely get used in other
builds they won't be going to waste and
yeah thank you very much and then we
have cables and connectors for days I
think this brands yield yield I've never
actually used their stuff before I don't
think anyway it doesn't matter we've got
a heap of cables and adapters and
and things that they are they're making
in collaboration with ek for the ek yeah
so I've certainly got everything I need
to make this build happen there's no
excuses now so I have got to get into
this actually we haven't looked at the
cooling yet so we got blood-red that
sounds pretty cool it's a premix and
we've got the clear cryo fuel so we've
got two bottles of clear two bottles of
red so that is going to go nicely red
clear not sure work out what we're gonna
do there but anyway I've got everything
I need we've got coolants we've got
troops we've got radios we've got pumps
we've got blocks cables connectors fans
it's going to happen I probably won't do
the build this week this week coming
because we have some thread Ripper 2nd
gen testing to do on the channel so I'll
be pretty bogged down with that you'll
see a video on that soon though but yeah
so plenty of things to do but I will get
to this as soon as possible hopefully
the following week I'll be able to start
it'll probably be a 3 or 4 part series
because there's obviously a lot of
building to do and yeah it's gonna take
me quite quite a few hours to get this
thing done I want to do it properly and
then once it's done it will be staying
here on the set for quite some time so
yeah keen to get into that this was just
a quick unboxing video I hope you guys
don't mind as I said I wasn't really in
the mood to get you to the content I had
planned but there'll be a video tomorrow
and the day after and I'll get done what
I meant to get done so that we've plenty
of content to come anyway hope you guys
enjoyed this unboxing you got to see all
the stuff that will be going to that
because a lot of you have been asking me
when I'm doing the coffee Ripper build
what's going in there when I'm gonna
make it happen all that sort of stuff so
now you sort of have your answer it's
it's happening EK have come to the
rescue they've provided all the bits and
pieces I need now it's all on me to make
it into an awesome looking build so we
will do that shortly thank you for
watching I'm your host Steve see you
next time
