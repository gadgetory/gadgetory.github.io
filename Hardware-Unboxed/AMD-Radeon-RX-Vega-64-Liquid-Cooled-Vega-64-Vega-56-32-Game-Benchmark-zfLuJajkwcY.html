biggest GPU benchmark session in the
channels history so big in fact for the
first time I was actually starting a rep
taking on the challenge anyway after
about a week's worth of testing I've
made it and we now have a heap of data
to look at but before we do that I would
like to just quickly touch on a few
things so almost two weeks ago now AMD's
knew a Radeon rx Vega series launched
and it's been smooth sailing ever since
yeah so that's not actually true is it
before Vega was even released we had a
pretty good idea that performance was
likely going to be lackluster at least
if you're expecting AMD to make a step
forward on the step in video made 12
months prior that step will see NVIDIA
come under pressure and consequently
reduce prices so we saw in last week's
video that Vega 56 it's really only just
a smidgen faster than the GTX 1070 and
that's for roughly the same amount of
money or is it we'll talk more about
pricing at the end of the video don't
really have time for all that drama just
yet Vega 56 it also consumed quite a bit
more power than the gtx 1070 so despite
looking quite impressive and at least
half a dozen of the 25 games originally
tested I felt it was still going to be a
bit of a tough sell let's just put it
that way well I haven't given Vega 56 a
pretty good workout I was yet to receive
Vega 64 and in fact I only got my sample
on Monday at which point I quite
literally dropped everything and began
testing and I've been doing that pretty
much ever since the results though are
now in and we have 32 games on deck I
had planned to add another 5 games over
the original 25 that had already tested
the week prior and I took to Twitter to
see which games you guys wanted to see
included in the end though with so many
requests I felt like I had to add an
additional seven games to try and keep
everyone happy so yeah we now have 32
games in total I hope you're happy
anyway with such an insane amount of
games tested I've ditched the TDP and 4k
results from the video they have been
included in the rig
over at Tech spot.com so if you want
those I'll include the link in the video
description updated from the previous
video I've now out of the geforce gtx
1070 and GT x 1080 found edition
graphics cards and they will be compared
alongside the custom board partner cards
from msi there really isn't much
difference but since a vocal minority
had a lot to say about it last time
again I've attempted to please everyone
this time anyway as was the case last
time I'll be using the core i7 7700 K
test system clocked at 4.9 gigahertz but
still plan to do very extensive testing
with Vega and the GeForce 10 series on
Verizon at a later date okay enough
messing about we have work to do getting
things going we have ashes of the
singularity or aka
ashes of the benchmark and for this
title aim DS new Vega series perform
quite well NVIDIA has put a heap of time
and effort into developing their drivers
low to make up for the GeForce 10s
lackluster dx12 performance and we're
certainly seeing that payoff here the
gtx 1070 roughly matched Vega 56 while
the GTX eternity matched both versions
of Vega 64 so overall a mild result here
for AMD Assassin's Creed syndicate has
been brought back for this video due to
popular demand as quite a few of you did
request it including Tim not sure if
he's a fan of the game or what was going
on there but here Tim wanted to see
Assassin's Creed syndicate added to this
big benchmark video so here it is
unfortunately though this is a very poor
title for AMD and even the air-cooled
Vega 64 card falls behind the gtx 1070
not a great effort in our second title
tested but aim they have another 30
titles to put on a better show well that
didn't take long right into Battlefield
one and already we're seeing much more
competitive performance from Vega
something worth noting though is how
poorly the air-cooled Vega 64 card does
in this title only just managing to edge
out Vega 56 the liquid-cooled version is
much more impressive managing an average
of 122 fps making it a good bit faster
than even the custom GT X 1080
Civilization 6 is another heavily
requested title and I had ditched this
one previously for my day 1 Vega
coverage and the reason why you can
pretty much see here it's really a bad
game to test GPU performance it's a
great game to test CPU performance but
you can see here even with a heavily
overclocked core i7 77 at K we are
mostly finding the limits of the cpu
still with 31 other games in the
comparison this GPU limited title won't
skew the results so I'm happy enough to
include it day six mankind Nevada is
another DirectX 12 title but this one is
far more GPU bound and as luck would
have it Vega does very well here this is
of course an AMD sponsored title but
even so it does show how well Vega can
perform when optimized for here Vega 56
comes a-knockin at the gtx 280s door
just letting it know there's no more
than a few frames in it meanwhile the
air-cooled Vega 64 model pulls ahead of
the MSI GTX 1080 gaming x 8g while the
liquid-cooled version pulls even further
ahead dirt fall left me very confused
after my initial vega 56 review but I've
since been able to confirm these results
value also does very well using two x
MSAA and even four x MSAA
but tanks with eight x msaa though when
i say tanks i mean it drops down to the
same level of the competing nvidia cards
anyway using CMAA the vega cards
absolutely trashed the geforce 10 series
and what is a completely baffling result
I've asked AMD about the various
performance anomalies in this title with
Vega I'm yet to hear anything back
moving on from the rather spectacular
dirt 4 numbers we find some rather
underwhelming performance in Dishonored
2 this title really has never been that
kind to AMD so I'm sure no one was
expecting anything overly impressive
here still seeing Vega 64 err called
only match the gtx 1070 found Edition
was certainly disappointing to say the
least
the liquid-cooled version also trailed
the GTX 1080 efi card as well
doom is a title where we always expect
AMD to do well I mean check out the RX
580 beating the GTX 1060 by 18 percent
margin in the case of Vega though it's
actually a lot less impressive Vega 56
is just 10 percent faster than the gtx
1070 fe while vega 64 err cord is only
able to match MSI's gaming X 1080 so
while strong performance overall it's
still not quite as impressive as you
might expect in this title despite Vega
56 racing ahead of the GTX 1017 f1 2016
the air-cooled Vega 64 model was most
unimpressive only
tacking on a few extra frames the
liquid-cooled version was much more
impressive and did manage to pull ahead
of the factory overclocked GT X 1080
from MSI overall solid performance from
Vega here with the exception of the air
called 64 model interestingly when
testing with Far Cry primal we see
almost no difference between Vegas 64
air-cooled and Vega 56 for that reason
the liquid cooled version was 16% faster
but even so only managed to match the
MSI GTX 1080 gaming X given how well the
RX 580 does in comparison to the GTX
1060 notarial you have to think there's
some driver work that needs to be done
here performance in front air is OK Vega
56 roughly matches the gtx 1070 Vega 64
though is a less impressive as the air
cooled model trails the GTX 280 Fe while
it takes the more expensive liquid
cooled version to match the MSI GTX 1080
Vega though is more appealing if you
focus on the 1% lows for this title
that's it either way the liquid cooled
Edition is much closer to the GTX 1080
than it is the 1080 TI Vega 56 does
manage to match the GTX 1070 Fe card in
Ghost Recon wildlands though again we
see that vega 64 really isn't that much
faster the liquid cooled version did
average 71 FPS though this only puts it
on par with the GT X 1080 founders
Edition and a few frames behind the MSI
GTX eternity gaming X I once said that
the horizon 5 1600 was better value than
the 7700 K for gaming last year I picked
the GTX 1060 over the RX 480 and yet
neither of those things suit up the
comments-section
nearly as much as dropping grand theft
auto 5 from the battery of games we test
with ok so that might be a slight
exaggeration but anyway you guys weren't
happy so it's back that said though Vega
is less than impressed with that
decision as even Vegas 64 liquid-cooled
loses out to the gtx 1070 founders
edition ouch
Hal we're seeing gtx 1060 lat
performance in this one hopefully a
driver update can improve performance
though I'm not sure how keen AMD will be
to go back and optimize such an old
title even if it is incredibly popular
he'll blades back for another round of
benchmarks previously Vega 56 trailed
the gtx 1070 fe in this title and of
course
things change between that review and
this one once again we find the
air-cooled version of Vega 64 isn't able
to pull away from Vega 56 the
liquid-cooled version does a much better
job though it could only match the GTX
1080 founders Edition moving on Vega 56
matched the gtx 1070 when testing with
hitman but it again took the liquid
cooled version of vega 64 to match the
gtx 10a founders edition card and this
is in a DirectX 12 title no less one
sponsored by AMD so this is another
disappointing result Mass Effect
Andromeda shows us what we've seen a
number of times already Vega 56 is
roughly on power of the GTX 770 while
Vega 64 needs to be liquid cooled to
catch up or at least come close to
catching the GTX 1080 another very
average result for AMD here moving on we
have Mirror's Edge catalyst and for this
one Vega looks quite competitive the
air-cooled Vega 64 model is still quite
underwhelming but I was impressed but
the liquid cool version pulled out this
time Vega 56 also does a good job
against the gtx 1070 next that we have
overwatch and this generally favors the
green team and again we see that here
when comparing Vega to the GeForce 10
series Vega 64 struggles to match the
gtx 1070 in this title and even the
liquid cool version drops to the same 1%
lows I mean we are seeing well over 100
FPS at all times but Vegas 64 pales in
comparison to the GTX 1080 unfortunately
right now Vega really sucks big time for
player unknowns battlegrounds and while
I'm sure many of you will know that
argue this game shouldn't be included as
it is an early access title I obviously
disagree in fact I do believe most of
you actually do agree with me because I
think I'm agreeing with most of you
because I did have a massive absolutely
massive amount of requests to have this
game included in the Vega benchmarking
the game might only be an early access
title but it's massively popular right
now and it's a game aimed as surely need
to optimize for as soon as possible
please note that on the final day of
editing this video aimday released
driver version 17 point 8.2
which claims to have addressed the
performance issues in player unknowns
battlegrounds by improving Vega 64 by up
to 18% this sounded great so I hit the
pause button on the editing and was
prepared to delay the video while
updated those results sadly however this
new driver didn't change performance for
Vegas 64 at all for me so some further
testing will be required I did of course
run ddu to remove the old drivers and
Safe Mode but after two tries I wasn't
able to extract any more performance in
this title with the new 17 point 8.2
driver I'll let you guys know if
anything changes in the future looking
at the average framerate performance in
prey we see the Vega is very competitive
with the competing GeForce ten series
graphics cards that said the 1% low
results will always noticeably lower so
I'm not sure if this is yet again
another suspected driver issue or
perhaps something else I shouldn't know
that the air-cooled Vegas 64 model was
pretty underwhelming while the
liquid-cooled version was decent AMD
recently released a crimson re-live 17
point 8.1 driver to improve performance
in quake champions and this is the
driver I used for all the Vega testing
please note the performance of the fury
X and rx 580 went unchanged with this
driver I sawed between a six to eight
percent performance boost for the Vega
GPUs in this title and that was enough
to push Vega 56 ahead of the GT X 1080
while the liquid-cooled Vega 64 card
wasn't much slower than the GTX 1080 Ti
so very impressive stuff in this title
albeit again this is a sponsored title
by AMD but still impressive stuff all
the same Vega cannot to play once again
this time in Rainbow six siege as Vega
56 was 12% fast in the msi gtx 1070
gaming ex we even see a rare quality
showing from vega 64 as the air-cooled
model x out i'll win over the msi gtx
1080 gaming ex so that's great to see
the liquid cooled model also pushes
further ahead but still lags behind the
gtx 1080i by a 15% margin here we see
yet again that in select titles Vega can
really turn up the heat on the GeForce
10 series this time we're testing with
Resident Evil 7 biohazard we see that
Vega 56 is able to beat the gtx 1070 by
a decent margin though the air-cooled
Vega 64 card does struggle against the
GTX 1080 at least the MSA doming X
version Vega 56 also makes out well in
rise of the Tomb Raider
though through here called Vega 64 model
was once again far less impressive once
liquid cooled though the results aren't
bad and we see the same 1% low
performance to that of the MSI
X 1080 gaming X Middle Earth shadow of
Mordor is an oldie but a goodie we're
testing with 32 games after all so why
not throw this one into the heap as luck
would have it Vega is also quite
competitive in this title Vega 56 beats
the gtx 1070 hands down and the
liquid-cooled version of AG f 64 takes
out the MSI GTX 1080 gaming X of course
it does cost a lot more but I think
there's probably still hope for the
custom board partner models Sniper Elite
4 isn't a game that I've tested with
before but quite a few of you have
requested it and it's a modern DirectX
12 title so I thought why not this is an
AMD sponsored title so it's probably not
gonna be surprising they say that Vega
does do well here even the air-cooled
Vega 64 model has pulled up at socks and
looks respectable for this one meanwhile
vega 56 is once again the star of the
show and beats out the factory
overclocked gtx 1070 without much
trouble The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt is
another title that's getting on now and
this one gives us some mixed results
vega 56 looks very good as it beats out
even the msi gtx 1070 gaming X however
air-cooled vega 64 fall short of the gtx
1080 and it takes the liquid cool model
before vega racing at GT x 1080 like
performance but titanfall 2 results are
very competitive as we see Vega 56 match
the gtx 1070 the air-cooled version of
vega 64 though can't quite catch the gtx
tane while the liquid cool version
though does get the job done albeit at a
questionable price premium Tom Clancy's
the division was tested using DirectX 12
and here we see vega 64 trouncing the
msi gtx 1070 gaming X in a true display
of pixel dominance even vega 64 does
well yeah the flippin head cooled
version actually beats the GTX 280 by a
handy margin and this means the liquid
cooled model is hot on the heels of the
GTX 280 Ti
testing total world Warhammer usually
plays into aim these hands and we
certainly see that here vega 56 is
nipping at the 1080s heels while vega 64
the air-cooled model outpaces the GTX
1080
then we have the liquid cooled card on
the hunt for the GTX 10 atti though it's
not quite quick enough off the market
ultimately gets left behind when testing
vega 56 previously I was shocked by how
strong this GPU was
in dawn of war 3 since then other media
outlets have confirmed exceptional
performance for vaguer in this title so
I'm very confident in the results if
only every game looked like this aim D
would be laughing anyway Vega 56 sticks
it to the GTX today while Vega 64 pulls
even further ahead the liquid cooled
edition gets within spitting distance of
the GTX 10 ATT I get it it's liquid
nevermind moving on watchdogs too hates
AMD doesn't matter if it's rising CPUs
or Vega GPS does not like AMD one bit
here we see the gtx 1070 found Edition
model giving not just Vega 56 a hard
time but also Vega 64 liquid cooling
Vega 64 pushes it ahead but only just
just ahead of the gtx 1070 that is
performance and pricing aside this is by
far vagus biggest turtle power
consumption in all honesty performance
isn't that bad and I might even improve
quite a bit over time moreover once
pricing settles down I'm sure everything
will be ok on that front as well what
won't change though is power consumption
yes you can
under volt and I'll be looking into that
in a future video but for now this is
what most Fager owners will be faced
with Vega 56 despite being a bit more
power-hungry in the GT X 1080 it's
really not that bad Vega 64 on the other
hand though is a serious power Pig the
air-cooled version makes the already
power-hungry GTX 10 ATT I look like it's
dieting I mean while the liquid cooled
model is gorging itself like a fat guy
an all-you-can-eat buffet seriously
they're pushing total system consumption
24% higher than that of the GTX 1080i
for an average of 18 percent less
performance is a real issue not everyone
cares as much as I do about power
consumption but regardless of your
opinion it does come in a cost and I
don't mean a few extra dollars on the
power bill Vega in its current reference
card form is loud and hot it's an angry
graphics cart and it takes that rage out
on your power supply anyway that's
enough on power for now let's move on
and try and wrap all this up okay so
there's the 32 games tested I kind of
you just breezed through them and didn't
go into the usual margins and talk too
much about percentages like I often do I
didn't want to risk boring some viewers
with just percentage after percentage
after percentage
was a lot of games tested so rather than
do that I'm gonna hit you with all the
percentages now in one quick go we're
gonna look at each game on a per game
basis and a single graph but be warned
there are four comparisons made here in
total so that gives us a hundred and
twenty eight individual data points so
get your reading glasses sorted and
let's get into it
previously we found Vega 56 to be 2%
fast msi gtx 1070 gamex on average
across 25 games I've since downgraded
slightly to the gtx 1070 found edition
which is only a few percent slower and
i've also removed crysis 3 as there had
a few issues with vega and i've replaced
it with eight other games so this has
changed the margins slightly and now
vega 56 is 5% faster though only about
three percent faster than the msi model
anyway as you can see the big wins for
AMD here are again dirt four and Dawn of
War three AMD does do well in many of
the newly-released titles particularly
those using modern api's so that's well
worth noting still there is troubling
performance in massively and I do mean
massively popular titles such as Grand
Theft Auto 5 and player unknowns
battlegrounds this is an issue for AMD
and they really need to work on this I
can probably turn the other way for
games such as Assassin's Creed and
dishonored though anyway overall a
strong showing for Vega 56 and once
pricing settles down we get some custom
board partner models I think it will be
a worthy alternative to the gtx 1070
moving on we have a much less exciting
comparison to make the air-cooled vega
64 model which if i'm honest was a bit
of a stinker overall it was 5 percent
slower than the gtx 1080 founders
edition and of course it runs much
hotter ladder and sucks down more power
than a skyler hicks processor on
steroids not much else really needs to
be said here the reference card just
ain't cutting it i do feel like the
board partner models will be
significantly better especially for the
Vegas 64 model but that'll be a story
for another day liquid cooling Vegas 64
and allow me to hit those higher clock
speeds while avoiding throttling really
helps this complex GPU the liquid cooled
version was 4% fast in the GT X 1080
found edition overall but in 10 of the
games tested it was faster by 10% margin
or greater of course the liquid cooled
Edition is priced $100 above the GTX 280
when looking at the standalone MSRP so
in terms of price versus performance
it's not how should we put it hot then
when compared to the GTX 1080i the horas
extreme version I used Vegas 64 liquid
coolers 18 percent slower and once
pricing corrects it should only be 14%
cheaper so another sketchy result for
Vega okay so I think we've just
established a pretty good baseline of
Vegas gaming performance
I'd say most other reviewers pretty much
concluded or agree by saying that Vega
56 is slightly fast in the gtx 1070 and
vega 64 is slightly slower than the gtx
1080 while the liquid cooled version
probably wins more than it loses but it
does struggle massively against the gtx
1080 TI that's pretty much the situation
from an FPS standpoint in a nutshell we
didn't really need to test 32 games to
come to that conclusion but i found it
interesting to see where Vega did well
and not so well it was also really
interesting to see which games the
air-cooled Vega 64 model offered good
gains over vega 56 and which games saw
very little separation between these two
GPUs it was also interesting to see some
games where vega 64 dominated the
geforce gtx 1080 and wasn't that far
behind the 1080 TI so there is some hope
for Vega yet speaking of which if we put
power consumption pricing and even the
performance aside for a moment I do
believe that one of aigis biggest issues
is AMD zone reference design this is of
course yet to be proven but if history
has shown us anything it's that AMD's
reference cards suck and they rub their
own products of performance obviously
not something you want to do with your
reference designer that said the liquid
cooled model might very well be a
best-case scenario for Vega and that's
kind of a good thing if board partners
can adequately cool bagger sixty-four
using air coolers then we might see
significant improvements in performance
for that model there's also room for
improvement with Vega 56 and I can
easily see that model beating the GTX
1070 by a comfortable tempo set margin
while remaining cool and quiet then we
have the issue of pricing or rather than
massively blown up controversy that's
now the leading news topics surrounding
Vega and yet at model being nothing more
than a typical supply and demand issue
the reason I ended up pulling down my
Vega pricing video
because I realized I couldn't really
prove what was going on here one way or
the other and therefore I was kind of
being a hypocrite calling it a fake news
story and in the end I wasn't really
even sure if the issue was worth
discussing at least just yet
I mean Vega was only released a few days
prior before all this started I was
happy with most of what I said in that
video but at the risk of just adding to
all the misinformation out there already
I pulled it down until we have something
more concrete to report on I think I'll
just hold fire still my opinion the
matter hasn't really changed we're
mostly looking at a supply and demand
issue here and that probably shouldn't
really surprise anyone this was always
going to happen even more so with
cryptocurrency mining the way it is
right now
if aim DS still pushing this premium
pack nonsense in a few weeks time or
especially in a month's time from now
then you lose your minds and go
completely ape until then I suggest
chilling out and realize that this is
probably just a supply and demand
situation much like what we've seen in
the past with graphics cards such as the
rx 580 rx 480 and even the GTX 1060 I'm
confident that once we see the board
partner cards arrive later next month we
will see Vega 56 and the 64 models
hitting the standalone MSRP that said
though if there is still a serious
supply and demand issue due to minors or
whatnot then you know that might not be
the case on a final note I spoke with PC
case gear about this a few days ago now
and they were really really helpful in
short they said their first shipment
included more non bundled cards than all
other SKUs combined and it wasn't a
small amount of cards either as expected
they sold like hotcakes they do have a
second shipment coming in before the end
of the month and they will possibly
allocate all of it as non bundled models
they also explained what we already know
there is a huge shortage and a nd stuck
between a rock and a hard place when it
comes to trying to get Vega to gamers
rather miners while keeping the price
realistic as I said previously the rx 4
ad was still selling for 40% over the
MSRP two months after release and mining
wasn't even booming them
well I'm sure many weren't happy that's
just how it goes these days with many of
these big popular GPU releases there's a
lot of PC gamers now and of course we
have to contend with cryptocurrency
miners anyway as usual
I do recommend you guys avoid the
reference cards sit tight and wait for
the much better custom cards and give
supply a chance to catch up with the
demand before going all berserk over hi
professors over all still not a hundred
percent sure how I feel about Vega there
are some promising signs that it could
be competitive or that it can be
competitive but yeah I'll reserve my
ultimate judgment - we have a few custom
Bullitt partner cards in hand I hope you
guys enjoyed this big vague of benchmark
session it was a massive undertaking but
I am glad I invested the time if you
enjoyed this video please take a moment
to give it a like and drop a comment
below and let us know what your thoughts
are also next week on that channel I
have a really big announcement to make
regarding an exciting new series so
