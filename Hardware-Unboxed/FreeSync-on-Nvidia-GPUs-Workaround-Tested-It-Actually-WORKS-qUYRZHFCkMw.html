today's view is a bit of an interesting
one because it's on a topic that's been
doing the rounds lately if you've been
keeping up with the main Redditt for pc
gaming you might have noticed a few
people suggesting it's possible to get
free sync working with an Nvidia
graphics card via an AMD GPU to separate
reddit threads notice that if you hook
up your free sync display to an AMD GPU
display output while your primary NVIDIA
GPU is still in your PC it is possible
to run games on the NVIDIA GPU while
still getting the benefit of free sync
one thread mentioned it was possible
with two discrete GPUs in the one PC one
from each vendor while the other more
widely circulated thread suggested all
you need is an NVIDIA GPU and an AMD APU
like the Rison 320 200 G this is a
pretty big deal if it's true because as
you all know invidious GPUs don't
natively support free sync instead
Nvidia forces gamers who want adaptive
sync into buying a decent component of
which are usually around 200 bucks more
expensive than their free sync
alternatives so getting free sync
working on NVIDIA GPUs would mean gamers
can buy cheaper displays and get the
exact same experience all those that
already have facing displays with NVIDIA
GPUs will be able to unleash the benefit
of adaptive sync so let's talk about the
apu method first because this one seems
to have been I guess the most vigorously
tested and proven to work at this point
basically if your system has an AMD
Raven Ridge apu like the Rison 320 200 G
and an Nvidia graphics card getting free
sync to work is quite simple just unplug
your free sync monitor from the NVIDIA
GPU then plug into your motherboard
instead this makes the integrated Vega
GPU the primary display output then all
you have to do is a few software side
tweaks you have to enable the integrated
graphics in your motherboards bios if
it's disabled by default and then you
simply head into the Nvidia control
panel and set the games you plan on
playing to using the NVIDIA GPU
alternatively you can use Windows 10s
new graphics setting feature to set
games to use the NVIDIA GPU what this
does is it renders the games on the
NVIDIA GPU then simply passes the
rendered data to the integrated Vega GPU
which
then sends it to the display as Rison
APU support freesync adaptive sync data
is packed up into the display stream
even though the NVIDIA GPU is actually
rendering the game simple easy solution
to enable free sync while still
harnessing the power of your NVIDIA GPU
of course not everyone has a system with
a Rison APU and not everyone wants to
build a risin APU system after all there
are plenty of CPUs much faster than the
Rison 520 400 G the gamers want to use
so this apu method for getting free sync
support is a bit limited but it does
open up the question could NVIDIA GPU
owners simply add in a discreet AMD GPU
to their system rather than an APU plug
their display into the AMD card and get
free sync support while still using the
NVIDIA GPU to render games well this
could be a pretty neat workaround for
those with expensive free sync monitors
and powerful NVIDIA GPUs you could add
in something like the Radeon rx 550
which costs just a hundred bucks or so
and that will give you free sync support
for less than the typical $200 cost of
the g-sync module in competing monitors
this is definitely something worth
looking into and there wasn't as much
information on it compared to the APU
method so I decided to give it a try I
whipped out my Intel Core i7 8700 K test
system in the be quiet dark based 700
instead about installing both an Nvidia
and AMD GPU in the same system on the
nvidia side we're using the gigabyte
geforce gtx 1070 TI windforce which will
be the primary rendering GPU then the
idea would be to pair it with an rx 550
because it's the cheapest AMD GPU you
can buy right now new that supports free
sync but I don't have an RX 550 on hand
I do have though an equally cheap free
sync capable graphics card I decided to
use instead Vegas 64 again the setup
process is pretty easy
both GPUs are installed in the system my
free sync display is hooked up to the
AMD GPUs display outputs via DisplayPort
and both Nvidia and AMD drivers are
simultaneously installed and of course
fruit sync is enabled in Radeon settings
after doing all of this I immediately
noticed a few issues unlike with the APU
method there is no way to set in
software
what GPU is to be used by default you
can't launch the nvidia control panel
when your display output is an AMD GPU
and when you display is plugged into the
nvidia GPU the Nvidia control panel
doesn't give any option to set the
NVIDIA GPU as default Windows 10 also
doesn't distinguish between the GPUs in
its graphics settings screen it will
only allow you to use the GPU the
display is hooked up to the reason for
this difference compared to the apu
method is simple the AP use integrated
graphics is listed as a power saving
option so both the Nvidia control panel
and Windows 10 settings allow you to
prioritize a high performance GPU
instead but when you have any two GPUs
in your system both are classed as high
performance so the option to choose a
GPU disappears and this makes sense most
users don't have two different graphics
cards in their system and if they did
and want it to game they'd simply plug
their monitor into the highest
performing one outside of niche hacks
like this there's no real reason for a
GPU selection option to exist but this
doesn't mean the free sync on NVIDIA
GPUs hack is dead in the water some
games have a built-in selection option
allowing you to choose which GPU is used
for rendering and it's with this option
that you can get it working in some
circumstances so first let's show the
baseline with the NVIDIA GPU hooked up
directly to the free sync monitor the
game I'm showing is Middle Earth shadow
of war because it's one of the titles
that actually has a GPU selector in just
the basic benchmark tool in the top left
we have the GPU utilization of each GPU
on the top is Vega 64 s utilization and
on the bottom is the 1070 TI utilization
keep that in mind for later then in the
upper right corner I've enabled a
feature of this free sync monitor that
shows the current refresh rate note this
isn't the frame rate but the actual
refresh rate of the panel it's also why
I'm videoing the monitor rather than
using a capture card when free sync is
active the refresh rate fluctuates and
you'll see no screen tearing but when
free sync is not active the refresh rate
will stay static at 144 Hertz and you
will see some tearing in this first
instance of the NVIDIA GPU hooked up
directly to the free sync monitor you'll
notice only the NVIDIA GPU is being
utilized but crucially the monitors
refresh rate is fixed at 144 Hertz and
there's some screen
as the framerate output is below 144 FPS
this shows as expected that nvidia gpus
don't support free sync now here's the
same benchmark being run on the AMD GPU
with the AMD GPU hooked up to the
monitor you'll see in the top left
corner that the NVIDIA GPU isn't being
used and the refresh rate is fluctuating
so free sync is working
lastly we get to the good stuff this is
the AMD GPU hooked up to the free sync
monitor but the game has been set to use
the NVIDIA GPU for rendering you'll see
in the top left corner that the NVIDIA
GPU has the highest utilization and the
AMD card is still being utilized a
little bit here as well but the magic is
really happening with the refresh rate
number it's fluctuating in line with the
render rate indicating freesync is
working there's no tearing either but
all the rendering is being done on the
NVIDIA GPU so it definitely works in
fact it works quite well the NVIDIA GPU
handles the rendering and the mb GPU
handles free sync now of course in my
situation using a 1070 Ti for rendering
and Vegas 64 for free sync makes little
sense because Vegas 64 could just do
both but this exact same process should
work with the much cheaper and slower rx
550 so owners of something like say the
GTX 1080 could add in an rx 550 for a
small cost and get free sync support
you're probably wondering is there a
performance impact from sending data
from the NVIDIA GPU to the display via
an additional AMD GPU and the answer to
that is yes but it's only a small amount
this chart shows the difference in hit
man's benchmark using DirectX 12 ultra
settings both average frame rates and 1%
lowest take hit of about 4% this is also
the margin in shadow of War's average
frame rates reported by the benchmark
but unfortunately fraps didn't work in
this game with the NVIDIA GPU passing
data to the AMD GPU so we don't have a
1% load data for that title but and this
is an enormous but well maybe not in
that way
anyway there are a number of problems
with this Nvidia free sync hack in fact
there are so many problems I actually
can't see anyone using this trick in
practice for starters without the
ability to select a primary rendering
GPU in Windows or in the Nvidia control
panel which again is possible with the
APU method but not with two GPUs
you were limited to games that have a
built-in GPU selector out of the
collection of games are regularly
benchmark just for have that feature
shadow of war
hitman Far Cry 5 and watchdogs - plenty
of other popular games including
fortnight battlefields one GTA 5 and so
on don't have a GPU selector so this
free sync trick won't work in those
games and then on top of that the GPU
selector didn't work in Far Cry 5 and
watchdogs - attempting to switch to the
NVIDIA GPU and restarting the game just
left me with a blank screen on launch
this is with both the latest in video
drivers and drivers from well before
people uncover this workaround so I
think it is just a bug rather than
Nvidia blocking the workaround for those
games so far I haven't found a way to
globally select to use the NVIDIA GPU
like as possible with the APU method if
you do have a neat trick to enable GPU
selection let me know but otherwise
we're stuck with this Nvidia free sync
hack in a very limited selection of
games if it worked across the board that
would make it the trick I guess somewhat
more worthwhile but as it stands this
just not that many games supported then
there's the issue of Nvidia themselves
while I did test with the latest three
9907 drivers I'm confident in video
we'll be looking for a way to patch and
disable this free sync workaround they
want to keep their graphics cards only
compatible with Qi sync monitors to keep
people locked in their ecosystem so any
method that gets free sync working
undermines this so I definitely wouldn't
be rushing out to buy an rx 550 to use
this free sync hack as you could end up
spending a hundred bucks only to have in
video block the workaround and then
you'll have wasted that cache if in
video was unable to block it and the
trick could easily be used in every game
this method could be the cheapest way to
get adaptive sync with NVIDIA GPUs but
unfortunately that's not really how it
works right now it's more a
proof-of-concept than anything else the
APU method is more functional but again
you run the risk of Nvidia blocking the
workaround and you're also forced into
using an AMD APU so it's not the most
practical solution for high end gamers
again more a proof of concept than a
workaround that's applicable to all in
the video GPU owners anyway that's it
for this look into this freesync on and
video workaround that's been talked
about a fair bit this week it's
definitely something that caught my eye
but I thought
it's just not all that practical
consider supporting us on patreon to
fund more of this type of testing and
get access to our exclusive discord chat
along the way we have a lot of fun in
there with you guys
that's it got to go edit this one I'll
catch you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
