gonna compare the cheapest r-tx 2060
graphics card you can buy right now to
one of the most expensive are TX 2060
graphics cards you can buy right now at
least from MSI anyway now the reason I'm
doing this is because I'm often asked if
it's worth spending a little bit extra
to get a graphics card such as this
gaming Zed model over something like the
Ventus XS right now you can purchase the
base model Ventus excess for three
hundred and fifty dollars u.s. and that
is of course the MSRP for the GeForce
r-tx 2060 however there are plenty of
options priced above the MSRP such as
MSI's most premium model the gaming Zed
which currently sells for three hundred
and ninety dollars u.s. and that makes
it well it makes it quite a bit cheaper
than an RT X 2070 so it's not
encroaching on base model RT X 2017
pricing by any stretch of the
imagination and it also means that it's
only about eleven percent more expensive
in this particular card and that's not
too bad but I'd say at this price range
was sort of getting into the cutoff
we're spending more money really starts
to hurt the value of the product still
if you're planning on keeping a graphics
card for at least two years to spending
an extra $40 really matter
I guess well it depends on what you're
getting and that's exactly what many of
you have been asking me so let's compare
the Ventus and gaming Zed models
head-to-head to work out if the premiums
worth it right off the bat I can tell
you guys the price hike isn't some kind
of scam MSI and other board partners
simply don't produce the same graphics
card then give the premium model a
factory overclock and call it a day
there are some real differences between
these graphics cards of course certain
models do have a receiver Asians that
cost extra ten dollars but yeah that's
not what we're talking about here
comparing the Ventus access to the
gaming Z I can tell you they are two
very differently designed graphics cards
and what the outcome of that is we'll
know in a moment but let's first quickly
compare the physical design of each
model as you can plainly see the gaming
Z is a physically larger graphics card
but it's more than just a larger PCB in
French
it's called RGB lighting after all it's
true there are some fancy lighting
effects but we don't really care about
those for this comparison getting back
on track it's 38 percent heavier thanks
to a much larger cooler featuring a
copper baseplate and many copper heat
pipes the aluminium cooler is also of
higher quality featuring significantly
more fins I'd estimate there's roughly
twice as much surface area to dissipate
heat with on the gaming Zed heatsink the
vent is ex heatsink on the other hand
it's much more basic affair you just get
a single copper heat pipe that comes in
direct contact with a GPU die so there's
no copper base plate here as I said it
so much more simplistic design however
both do feature a pair of 85 millimeter
fans but whereas the Ventus fans have 11
blades each the gaming Zed fan packs 14
and this allows it to move a little more
air but real crucially maintain higher
static pressure at the same rpm so
that'll help push more air through that
heatsink then moving out of the PCB we
see that both models feature the same IO
configuration so nothing out of the
ordinary there and they both have the
same eight pin power input however the
larger more expensive gaming Zed model
packs a 5 plus 2 phase verum whereas the
Ventus gets a 4 plus 2 phase varium this
should help the gaming Zed run a little
cooler and hopefully it will improve
overclocking though to be fair all our
TX 2060 graphics cards are quite limited
in this respect now out of the box the
gaming Zed maintains a typical operating
frequency of 1950 megahertz and at this
frequency operates at 73 degrees in a 21
degree room with a fan speed of 1700 rpm
this means it is virtually silent and
you certainly can't hear it in a really
quiet system the ventures on the other
hand that operated at around 1845 to
1800 and 60 megahertz and in the same
test peak to just 70 degrees though the
fans were operating slightly faster at
1900 rpm though again in a quiet system
you really won't be able to hear this
graphics card this means out of the box
the gaming Zed's GPU clock speed was
operating somewhere between 4 to 6%
faster and I guess the question now is
how much of a difference does this make
in the real world to find out we have a
few quick gaming benchmarks that have
been conducted
on our standard core Oh $9.99 or okay
GPU test rig first up we have f1 2018
and here the biggest margin you'll find
is just three percent and for the most
part you're really looking at two
percent or less given the margin of
error is one to two percent it's fair to
say in terms of performance there's
virtually no difference between these
two r-tx 2060 models and it's not just F
1 2018 where we see virtually no
difference either we see the same thing
when testing with far cry new dawn in
fact here we don't even see a 3 percent
difference and we're moving a strange
Brigade we see the same story once again
despite pushing over 130 FPS on average
at 1080p we're only seeing a 2 FPS
difference at most and then lastly we
have World War Z and once again it's
more of the same out of the box the
Ventus excess and gaming Z versions of
MSI GTX 2060 deliver near enough to the
same performance now let's talk
overclocking looking at the Ventus first
our particular retail card couldn't
maintain a 2 gigahertz operating
frequency at least without crashing and
they still limit us to 1980 megahertz
still that's at least a six percent
overclock at this frequency the GPU hit
just 70 degrees but the fans did spin up
to 2100 rpm and here I could just hear
them over the case fans the gaming said
on the other hand maintained 2040
megahertz quite easily with the fan set
to order they spun at just nineteen
hundred and fifty rpm and he actually
lowered the GPU temperature from the 70
degrees we saw out of the box for just
67 degrees so quite an impressive result
there now I'm not going to go over any
performance graphs you overclock these
cards were within 1 FPS of each other
and both were boosted by about 5 to 6
percent when compared to the
out-of-the-box performance and I'll just
lastly say I'd really only use this
overclocking information as a rough
guide as as you really are playing the
silicon lottery here so it's quite
possible you could get a ventus model
that could match or even beat a gaming
Zed model when it comes to overclocking
but as we've just seen it doesn't really
matter too much which card hits the
outright highest frequency because the
results are going to be much the same
anyway the premium mid-range graphics
card debate is an interesting one from a
design standpoint the gaming Z is
clearly the superior product in every
regard for a relative
small investment you do get a much
better quality cooler a slightly better
PCB design and a slightly more
aggressive factory overclock
unfortunately all this accounts for very
little when dealing with an
ultra-efficient 160 watt TDP graphics
card that essentially overclocks itself
on paper the gaming Zen is clock seven
percent higher but in reality the
operating frequency can almost be half
that we're still performance doesn't
scale linearly with frequency so this
means a seven percent frequency boost
will often result in just a four or
maybe five percent performance boost and
sometimes it can even be less than that
so the gaming Zed might be a better
quality product but even at just an 11%
price premium it doesn't offer an 11
percent improvement in anything not FPS
performance not cooling performance and
not operating volume and even if you
could stack all the advantages together
the very slight performance increase the
slightly better cooling and the slight
improvement and operating volume even if
you pack all that together I'm not sure
it justifies dishing out the extra cash
in short if you're after maximum value
always stick with the models that meet
the MSRP consider spending ten dollars
more if it gets you a noticeably better
model maybe one with three fans but
other than that I just stick with the
base models having said all that if
you've got a little bit of extra cash
and I'm talking a little bit enough to
get something like the gaming Zed model
and not step up to the next level for
something like an RT X 27 for $500 so
yeah if you've got a bit of extra cash
and for whatever reason you don't want
to spend it on maybe something like an
SSD or put it towards some sort of other
upgrade for your computer it's your
money you can do whatever you want with
it so if you want to spend it on a
slightly better graphics card then sure
I suppose get a premium model if it
makes you a bit more excited about the
build a bit more a bit more proud of the
purchase let's say and just lastly if
you think the numbers here look a bit
off you're expecting the gaming Zed
model to be noticeably faster than the
Ventus I'd suggest checking out this
rather excellent video by mr. tech deals
he made this earlier in the year it's a
really really well done video I think so
I'll link that in the video description
basically he purchased half a dozen r-tx
2060 graphics cards with his own money
and that included the beastly a soos ROG
Strix model and if
exactly what I have very little
difference the Strix round over ten
degrees cooler than the Venter so that's
very impressive but due to the way GPU
boost works it was just 1 to 2 FPS
faster out of the box and I think that
will do it for this one
