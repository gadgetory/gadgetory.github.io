ashes of the singularity for the first
time this upcoming RTS game has received
a lot of attention due to the fact will
most likely end up being the first
DirectX 12 title to be released the
initial benchmark released back in
October 2015 showcase DirectX 12
features such as asynchronous compute it
was discovered that the new async
compute feature doesn't work well with
Maxwell GPUs as it's not supported at
the hardware level instead nvidia patch
support in a driver level which came in
a performance cost this was seen back in
October MD is juicy and architecture on
the other hand features hardware-based
async computer and this hands them a
serious advantage and DirectX 12 games
so with Maxwell and video have been more
focused on directx 11 performance and to
a certain extent this makes sense of
course the games released while Maxwell
remains parent will only use directx11
giving them time to shift focus whence
DirectX 12 becomes more commonplace
still the DirectX 12 pain is real and in
regards to ashes of the singularity
could be about to get even worse today
developer oxide is releasing an updated
version 2 point 0 of the benchmark which
features advanced use of DirectX 12
multi cue and signaling mechanisms in
other words more advanced asynchronous
computers apart from a heavier emphasis
on a scene compute the updated benchmark
enables another very cool and exciting
feature called explicit multi-gpu this
technology means gamers can now install
an additional graphics card into their
pc for increased performance now you're
probably thinking map we've had that
ability for over a decade it's called
SLI or crossfire where explicit
multi-gpu differs from traditional
multi-gpu methods supported by AMD and
NVIDIA is that allows users to game
simultaneously with an AMD and an nvidia
graphics card that's right you heard me
correctly and what's an unnatural and
perhaps even unholy pairing it's
possible to combine a geforce gtx 980 TI
and a radiant are no fury X for example
without delving into the long and fairly
complicated details as to how this is
possible let's give to the results for
those that would like more information
I'll post something over at the harbor
own box forums later today
keep starting the benchmarking we have
geforce gtx 970 and radeon r9 390
unfortunately for NVIDIA uses the latest
actions of the singularity performance
isn't looking great as the 390 was
twenty-three percent faster at 1080p and
nineteen percent faster at 1440p that's
a huge margin given we expect these gpus
to deliver similar performance in
today's DirectX 11 titles combining the
two with the 970 is the primary display
card through superformance over a single
970 by sixty-seven percent which isn't
bad boost over the single 390 was less
impressive just thirty five percent more
performance was had at 1080p and
thirty-two percent more 1440p swapping
the cards around by placing the 390 in
charge booster performs at 1080p by
sixteen percent for an average frame
rate of 58 FPS this meant the combo is
now fifty-seven percent faster than a
single 390 and ninety-two percent faster
than a single 970 finally opting for a
pair of three 90s seemed like the way to
go as the average frame rate at 1440p
was now 52 FPS a thirteen percent gain
over the three ninety and nine seventy
pairing I should also point out the
crossfire was disabled for this test so
the graphics cards are being linked
without any driver support very cool
indeed although the gtx 980 is typically
faster than the 390 x and often by a
decent margin this isn't the case in
ashes of the singularity here the 390 X
is fourteen percent faster at 1080p and
1440p combining the tube with the 980 is
the primary display adapter produced
fairly average numbers swapping the tool
around which the 1080p framerate 261 FPS
with 49 FPS at 40 40 p that said we
again find opting for a pair of AMD
cards will be the preferred choice in
ashes this last pairing which I like to
call my fury ti provide some very
damning results the 980 TI which we're
used to seeing match or even beat the
fury x gets completely annihilated the
fury ax is almost an unbelievable thirty
one percent faster at 1080p and 1440p is
an even greater thirty-six percent
margin seen at 4k despite the massive
performance deficit coupling the cards
yields fairly impressive results so
again I should note that to fury X cards
are considerably faster especially a
1440p and 4k where other system
bottlenecks are
GPU performance here we see that it is
in fact a sin computed causing most of
the pain for the NVIDIA GPUs if the GTX
980 TI became over twenty percent faster
at 1080p once disabled even with async
compute disabled the fury axe still
performed admirably though once enabled
and enjoyed a few extra frames per
second this here is why AMD is so
desperate for a low-level API not only
does it solve their driver overhead
issues but it removes the CPU bottleneck
as well AMD likes to point out that
DirectX 12 allows developers to utilize
all 8 cores of the high and FX
processors and this is the sole reason
my performance is so much better under
DirectX 12 truth be told their processes
are still inefficient and while DirectX
12 does improve CPU utilization it
mostly removes traffic that was swamped
in the CPU and holding up GPU workloads
finally due to the fact that graphics
card drive is a far less important under
DirectX 12 aimed a should enjoy another
win in the form of your videos game
works program becoming a lot less toxic
than it has been for DirectX 11 games
this latest 2 point 0 version of the
ashes of the singularity benchmark
paints quite a different picture to
their first version the advanced
implementation of Esen computers
crippled and videos GPUs and will be
interesting to see if they can optimize
the drivers further to improve
performance the ability to mix AMD and
NVIDIA GPUs has massive implications
that extend well beyond this single
DirectX 12 title in fact I should point
out that it's also possible to use the
explicit multi-gpu feature with Intel's
integrated graphics or an AMD apu and
then you can of course also mix
different model graphics cards from the
same brand for example if you purchase
the vanilla fury back when was released
paying over five hundred dollars for a
second card when the nano can be had for
less is a bit painful having the ability
to use a fury in nano together in
directx 12 games is pretty attractive
option of course this is just one
example I'm sure there are dozens of
useful scenarios where explicit
multi-gpu proves invaluable on that note
I'm aware that the testing this video
provides just a small snapshot of what's
possible and for now I don't plan to do
too much more testing at least not until
the game is officially released as
always be sure to let me know what you
think in the comments what are you
making the new Direct X 12 features do
you think will be a game-changer like me
would you rather to stick with a single
brand
i'm your host Matt signing off and I'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
