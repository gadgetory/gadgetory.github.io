I'm your host Matt and today we're
taking a look at creative soundblaster
x85 gaming headset there's something
very refreshing about the way creative
gone about the entire package for the h5
headset from the first look it's quite
apparent that they've focus purely on
functionality and performance of a
flashy gimmicks and tricks the packaging
it comes in is basic for lack of a
better word well yes it's a round
plastic bubble I honestly don't think it
looks good at all in fact it looks cheap
but do I care no as a smart consumer I'm
interested in what's inside rather than
the packaging I'll open at once and then
promptly throw away inside this plastic
bubble which my mother initially mistook
for some sort of cooking appliance
understandably is a very practical and
professional gaming headset I first
noticed despite its steel frame just how
light as headset was this is a big plus
for me as long game sessions do not
prove a heavy headset comfort wise the
h5 s of some of the best I've actually
ever worn this is in spite of the fact
that the cans don't rotate to all of the
padding on both the arm and the ear cups
are soft as clouds and I'd be surprised
if anybody found this headset anything
less than very comfortable as mentioned
the h5 features a steel frame that's
surprisingly bendable and will certainly
be durable and the cups are held by
solid brush steel adjustable arms
looks-wise these headphones are kind of
like the packaging no frills they're
black
there's no RGB lighting and the feature
the Sound Blaster X logo on each side
and that's about all there is to say oh
yeah and the audio cables that run to
the cups are braided now I think that
covers everything something I find
really cool about this headset is that
it's kind of modular with the included
microphone inline mic cable and the
longer PC suited cable you can set the
headset up to suit your situation a way
in which I see this being really handy
is if you want to use this headset
community and gaming when you're heading
out you can unplug the mic and the PC
cable and leave them by a PC and travel
with just the shorter inline mic cable
which is obviously suited for your
smartphone at least that's the way I'd
do it all of this wouldn't add up too
much of the sound quality wasn't there
but luckily in the case of the h5 it
really is
I had the headset connected through our
sound blast 85 DAC and dr. Dre's Compton
in flack pumping and it sounded really
great the base is punchy and the clothes
design makes you feel like you're in
your own world and anything about 50%
volume despite the lack of noise
cancellation although I wouldn't say
it's as isolating as the Logitech G 633
out of a spectrum now let's talk about
creatives Blaster X acoustic engine
light software that's made to pair with
the h5 firstly I thought it was pretty
unfortunate that its requirement to
register creative in order to download
and install the software it's not an
instant download either you have to
register with the legit email address
and then they'll send you the download
link and activation key why I don't know
all I do know is that a lot of people
would not be happy about it in the case
of the h5 the software is kind of
limited to it seems a fully customizable
blastx acoustic engine software is
available only for the upcoming
soundblaster x87
and soundblaster x g5 only so h5 years
is the limited to being able to swap
between five different gaming profiles
which tweak and toggle surround sound
crystallizer base smart volume and
dialogue plus surprisingly there's no
music preset the last option is to
toggle all effects off the different
profiles are kind of cool but I'm not
sure why users unable to create their
own profiles or tweak existing ones
perhaps this is a feature they want to
reserve for their flagship headsets I
don't know I think it's probably a
mistake to make this limitation but for
me it's definitely not a deal-breaker as
I rarely played with such settings after
initial setup lastly I've recorded this
section for you guys using the supplied
detachable noise reducing microphone I
think the recording quality is pretty
good for the headset mic although it's
always gonna stay on average in contrast
to our studio marks to keep that in mind
overall the Sound Blaster xh5 gaming
head
is a really solid product with great
sound solid build quality and practical
features such as the removable mark it's
a really good mid-range option at 130
dollars if I was in the market whoever
I'd be keeping an eye out for at age 7
which is supposed to be released late in
2015 and is expected to come in and
around one hundred and fifty nine
dollars thanks for watching another
installment of hardware unboxed if
