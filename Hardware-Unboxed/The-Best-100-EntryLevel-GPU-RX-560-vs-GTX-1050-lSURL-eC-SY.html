the menu we have to affordable graphics
cards and in an effort to work out which
one deserves your money I've tested them
in a grand total 30 games roughly eight
months ago now I set out to do much the
same investing a few days benchmarking
the Radeon rx 460 and geforce gtx 1050 I
also threw in the 1050 Ti and those
graphics cards were tested in 24 games
the M result was a huge win for Nvidia
the 1050 easily dispatched of the Radeon
rx 460 offering on average 18% more
performance since then a few things have
changed which should push things in
AMD's favor firstly the drivers have
improved dramatically since the release
of the RX 460 and my initial testing
more recently AMD has sponsored a number
of popular triple-a titles which has
helped even things up and finally we now
have an updated and fully enabled rx 560
for the same $100 MSRP as many of you
will be aware the Radeon rx 460 was not
the full Polaris 11 silicon as it had
just 896 cause enabled this was later
discovered when some sneaky enthusiasts
found a way to unlock or 1,024 cause
using a modified BIOS you might be
wondering why am d wood manufacturer 123
millimeter squared GPU consisting of
three billion transistors and not enable
all of the cause the primary reason was
likely down to yield initially ambi
probably wasn't seeing the success rate
they would have liked and so mass
manufacturing a 1,024 core enabled rx
460 wasn't going to be that
cost-effective GPUs with a certain
amount of defective causes are usually
Bend as lower around parts the failed
cause are disabled and it gets solders
apart with a lower coil count now that
the 14 nanometer process has matured AMD
will be seeing a higher success rate and
therefore producing fully enabled
Polaris 11 parts is now a viable option
enter AMD's Radeon rx 560 this little
guy here and this really is AMD's
last-ditch effort to reclaim the
entry-level market segment for this
generation when compared to the previous
iteration the 560 packs 14% more cores
and they've clocked 6
that higher for good measure so it shall
be interesting to see what this means
for the 560 remember the 1050 was 18%
faster on average when compared to the
rx for 60
so can better drivers neela games and a
decent upgrading specifications get AMD
over the line this time as I said to
find out I have tested both GPUs using
30 games the games have been tuned to
use appropriate presets ranging from low
to high depending on the title and all
the testing has been conducted at 1080p
using my risin 5 1400 system the 1400
CPU hasn't been overclocked and just
eight gigabytes of ddr4 2666 memory was
used so a very realistic hardware
configuration then but it also doesn't
risk heavily bottlenecking the GPUs
either one thing worth noting is that I
could only get my hands on a full
gigabyte version of the rx 560 as buying
an AMD based graphics card right now
it's pretty difficult Drina - snapping
them all up anyway they shouldn't
influence performance the only game
where this might give the RX 560 an
unfair advantage over the 2 gigabyte
1050 is doom this is a very unusual
title with its memory usage please note
that I strongly recommend rx 560
Shoppers and this also goes the same for
the 1050 and rx 460 that they avoid the
full gigabyte models the GPU really
isn't powerful enough to properly
utilize that much memory this makes the
price premium for the full gigabyte
version impossible to justify in my
opinion so please up for the 2 gigabyte
model they should only cost about $100
u.s. or possibly even less one on sale
ok we've all that out of the way I think
it's time to jump to the benchmarks so
let's do that once again kick starting
things we have World of Tanks using the
updated HD client the game isn't hugely
demanding a spite looking reasonably
good for what it is
here the GTX 1050 is quite a bit faster
than the rx 560 delivering 26 percent
more performance that said the RX 560
did push over 60 FPS for the most part
so performance at 1080p was very
acceptable still though the GTX 1050 is
clearly the better option here and will
enable smooth gameplay even at 1440p
next up we have grand theft auto 5 and
this game provides much more competitive
results here the gtx 1050 was just 4%
faster than the RX 560 while the 1052
I was only 5% faster than the vanilla
1050 the quality options were set to
normal msaa was disabled and all the
advanced graphics options were also
disabled this allowed for very playable
performance at TP for these GPUs
The Witcher 3 is the last pre 2016 title
that I've tested with and yet again we
find another old title that favors the
Green Team this time the GTX 1050 was
10% faster than the rx 560 though it has
to be said with hair works disables and
only medium quality settings enabled at
1080p performance wasn't overly
impressive with either GPU rise of the
Tomb Raider provides the rx 560 with its
first win well sort of the minimum frame
rate was slightly higher for the Radeon
graphics card well both turned out 47
FPS on average meanwhile the gtx 750ti
provided an additional 17 percent
performance hitting 55 FPS on average
ashes of the benchmark has been included
and as you might expect the RX 560 is
able to close in on the GTX 1050 for
this one that said performance was much
the same using either GPU so we pretty
much have a tie in this title the HD
texture pack was disabled this time for
testing with Far Cry primal and I love
the visual quality preset to normal
doing so allowed the GTX 1050 to render
58 FPS on average and this minute was
14% faster than the rx 560 so a
disappointing result for AMD here
despite offering a playable performance
Tom Clancy's the division was tested
exclusively using the DirectX 12 API and
this gave AMD the edge here as the rx
560 averaged 57 fps to the GTX 1050 s 51
FPS that's a respectable 12 percent
performance advantage going the way of
the Red Team hitman is another title
tested using DirectX 12 and here the rx
560 again matches the GTX 1050 for the
average framerate while providing a
strong a minimum result we're even able
to highly playable performance with an
average of 80 fps the GTX 1050 provided
an average frame rate of 58 fps in
quantum break and this minute was 16%
faster than our X 560 this time the
medium quality preset was enabled at
1080p serious overwatch players on a
budget will do very well with these GPUs
using the high quality pre
the RX 560 and GTX 1050 both managed to
keep frame rates over 90 FPS for the
most part and surprisingly the RS 560
was 6% faster than the GTX 1050 so an
unexpected result for this title which
generally favors Nvidia hardware Doom is
possibly the only game of the 30 games
tested but will favor the full gigabyte
rx 560 over the 2 gigabyte model that
said without a to give up model I can't
tell for sure and I don't know by how
much though given the evidence found
previously I believe this would be the
case so then keeping it's possible
unfair advantage in mind the RX 560 was
32% faster than the GTX 1050 in this
test but 15% slower than the 4 gigabyte
GT x 1050 TI total war Warhammer is
another game I tested using the DirectX
12 API and here we see that the RX 560
was actually slightly slower than the
gtx 1050 at least when comparing the
average framerate next up we have
Mirror's Edge catalyst and this time the
GTX 1050 edged ahead by 5 percent margin
hitting 58 FPS on average the game was
configured using the medium quality
preset so the performance seen here by
these entry-level GPUs is respectable
testing with f1 2016 reveals very
competitive performance though the GTX
1050 was again able to take the lead
delivering 4% more frames at 1080p using
the high quality preset still both GPUs
averaged over 60 FPS for a perfectly
playable and very smooth experience
Davis X mankind divided was tested using
the medium quality preset even so though
these entry-level gamers only spat out
41 FPS on average with a 33 FPS minimum
in the end the RX 516 GTX 1050 delivered
the same experience in this title like
Deus Ex mankind divided battlefield one
ends in a tie this is one of the few
games I tested using the maximum in-game
quality settings I probably should have
downgraded to the high or medium preset
to push the frame rate above 60 FPS but
chances are they still would have seen a
tie or at least very similar performance
margins mafia 3 is a horribly an
optimized game and even at 1080p using
the lowest possible quality settings the
Radeon rx 560 was good
for just 31 FPS on average well the GTX
1050 managed a slightly better 38 fps
although I say slightly better the
GeForce graphics card did turn out to be
a whopping 23 percent faster though with
an average of just 38 fps it doesn't
exactly feel like the big win that
figure would suggest Gears of War 4 is a
DirectX 12 title but it's also an Nvidia
sponsored title so unsurprising that the
GTX 1050 comes out ahead though only by
very slim margin both GPUs managed
around 60fps on average using the medium
quality settings so this game still
looked quite good while maintaining very
playable performance titanfall 2 is a
game that historically tends to favor
AMD and we see a bit of that here the rx
560 is able to catch the GTX 1050 in
this title both delivering around 70 FPS
with a minimum frame rate of 59 FPS so
very solid performance from both the
Radeon and GeForce graphics cards here
moving on AMD enjoys a decent
performance advantage in Civilization 6
though sadly this isn't a game that
really requires more than maybe 30 FPS
that said though when it comes to frame
rates the more the merrier and it's
great to see the rx 560 flexing its
muscles in yet another DirectX 12 title
outpacing the GTX 1050 by a fifteen
percent margin like titanfall 2
Call of Duty infinite warfare is another
game that aim there generally does very
well with and that being the case the rx
560 was just a few frames faster the GTX
1050 here today performance all around
was impressive given we are using the
high quality of preset at 1080p dropping
down to the medium quality preset for
dishonored - still saw these graphics
cards fall short of the 60fps target
quite sure in the case of the GTX 1050
and rx 560 the GTX 1050 was 7% faster
than the RX 560 for the average frame
rate I hae whopping 21 percent faster
when comparing the minimum frame rate
using these quality settings the game
was noticeably smoother with the GeForce
graphics card like Dishonored 2 we see
that the RX 560 struggles in watchdogs 2
when looking at the minimum frame rate
although it was only 7% slow and
comparing the average frame rate that
figure does jump to 16% for the minimum
so then a somewhat disappointing result
frame D here moving on from what was a
disappointing result we find something
quite different resident
seven which generally plays very well on
AMD hardware and we see that here with
the rx 560 as it averaged 61 FPS at
1080p using the medium quality preset
this made it a few frames faster than
the GTX 1050 admittedly not a lot in it
but a win for the RX 560 nonetheless the
GTX 1050 runs away with it and for on
are providing 16% more frames at 1080p
using the medium quality preset that
said though the rx 560 still did quite
well averaging 57 fps but yeah the 1050
was obviously quite a bit better as it
never dropped below 53 fps similar
margins are seen when testing with Tom
Clancy's Ghost Recon wildlands here the
GTX 1050 was 16% faster for the average
frame rate and a whopping 36 percent
faster when comparing the minimum frame
rate result so again another
disappointing result for AMD Mass Effect
Andromeda provides very competitive
numbers both the GTX 1050 and rx 560
deliver the same experience with frame
rates mostly hovering around the mid-50s
this performance was seen when using the
medium quality preset at 1080p moving on
the RX 560 edged ahead by a few frames
in Dona war3 making it ever so slightly
fast on the GTX 1050 of course 48 fps to
51 fps isn't exactly a noticeable
difference but still good to see some
competitive performance from the RX 560
in this title back when I created my
what does it take to play video for prey
I recommended gamers opt for the GTX
1050 Ti and using the high quality
preset at 1080p you can easily see why
the 1050 t I managed to average 78 FPS
while the standard 1050 was still good
for 69 FPS
making it 25% fast the RX 560 which
delivered just 55 FPS finally we have do
it for and for this title the RX 570 was
featured in the what does it take to
play video and again you can see why
here the RX 560 is able to roughly match
the gtx 1050 so one of us better results
then when it comes to power consumption
the Radeon rx 560 winds quite
comfortably unfortunately having the
greatest number here isn't actually a
win of course it's like having the
highest score in golf
anyway the entire system consumed just
172 watts under gaming load which
obviously isn't that much despite being
a 20% increase
over the same system using the GTX 1050
so while not ideal for AMD graphics
cards it's not really a deal-breaker
either okay I wish I could tell you that
was the end of the graphs but if I did
I'd be lying helping us decide which
entry-level GPU is worthy of your gaming
rig are a few graphs that help summarize
the performance just seen first up let's
take a look at a graph that shows us the
average performance across the 30 games
just tested as I was summarizing the
results on a per game basis I really
felt the GTX 1050 was coming out well
ahead in this battle at least that's how
it seemed anyway that said though I was
shocked after telling up all the results
the performance was much the same
overall in fact the 1050 was just one
FPS faster for both the average and
minimum frame rate so that being the
case let's move on to take a better look
at the margins per game I really love it
when we get to this average breakdown
type graph for these big benchmark
videos it really gives us a clearer
picture of the overall performance and
where the wins and losses were had now
the biggest outlier here is obviously
doom and this is a small issue given
it's possible the RX 560 was cheating in
this title with that full gigabyte VM
buffer again this is the only game I
know of that might favor the larger
memory buffer under playable conditions
for these entry-level class GPUs that
said that I'm not too worried about
including this result after all removing
it only changes the overall result by a
single percent the RX 560 becomes three
percent slower without doom included so
feel free to recalculate that if you
want but like I said it doesn't really
change the overall picture much and
that's the beauty of testing with such a
massive amount of games I should just
point out that the rx 560 was faster by
5% margin or greater in just 6 titles
while it was slower by 5 percent margin
or greater in 12 games so time to make a
choice here the RX 560 or the gtx 1050
it is a tough one
but I think I'll be sticking with the
choice I made eight months ago and that
is to buy the 1050 as we just saw the
1050 was faster overall winning most of
the 30 games tested or winning the
majority of games out of the 30 games
tested you guys know what I mean
overall that was only slightly faster
but
then get it over the line for me is the
fact that it is more power-efficient
again only well it is depending on how
you look at it in the grand scheme of
things slightly more power-efficient I
don't know I'll let you guys decide
whether that's super important or not
but a couple slightly more
power-efficient with slightly faster I
think you have a slightly better
graphics card it's also more convenient
all rx 560 cards will require a 6 pin
PCI power connector whereas most 1050
shouldn't the g1 gaming from gigabyte
does and I think that's a stupid part or
stupid design of this card because it
doesn't provide any more overclocking
Headroom or boost performance in any way
and it is required you can't use the
card without it so strange choice there
by gigabyte ya be looking for a 1050
card without a 6 pin PCI power connector
or any power connector for that matter
but speaking of overclocking and other
strength of the 1050 is also superior
overclocking Headroom and that's good
for an entry-level card because
generally if you are going to have a
clock you want to squeeze every last bit
of performance out of it
maximize your bang for the buck and this
cards don't let you do that the RX 560
would have to be at least $20 u.s.
cheaper for me to consider purchasing it
over the 1050 oops in my opinion the
only real advantage the 560 has is free
Singh support and if you can take
advantage of that then it might make
sense to get the rx 560 over the 1050
but that's something for you to decide
on short of that though for me it's the
1050 all the way as a side note I'm
still not a fan of the gtx 1050 TI it's
actually nothing wrong with the GPU
itself it is superior to the vanilla
1050 the problems the price so unless
you can get it at a discounted price
it's just not worth it they do typically
sell for $140 u.s. and at that price
they're 40% more expensive than the
standard 1050 and as you just saw based
on the 30 games just tested it was on
average just 15% faster so again unless
you can get it at about well 120 us
maybe be worth it around that price yeah
consider the 1050 TI but any more it's a
waste of money on a quick but unrelated
note I would just like to say a big
thank you to everyone who supported the
channel hardware unboxed has just
crossed the 100,000 subscriber mark
very exciting stuff pretty incredible
really what I took over a map back in
October of last year we were just at
30,000 subscribers which will very
chuffed that back then but I have to say
at the time I didn't think it would
possible to more than triple that figure
by now eight months later so yeah very
excited and appreciate the support big
thank you everyone who has subscribed
and watches our content for those of you
who do enjoy our content and don't want
to miss a video be sure to hit that
little alert Bell next to the subscribe
button I bring this up because casting a
bit of negative light over the 100,000
subscriber achievement is the fact that
in the last week growth on the channel
has slowed to its lowest rate this year
which was a bit confusing
earlier in the week some of you claimed
that you weren't being notified of my
new videos I didn't pay too much
attention at that time YouTube has its
bugs and glitches but it has gone for a
week now and I have seen a big decline
in daily views and new subscribers as a
result YouTube tells me they are aware
of this issue it's not affecting all
channels but something seems to be
affecting ours but anyway I don't want
to complain about it or anything too
much very happy with where we're at and
how things are going but I just wanted
to bring it to you guys directly in case
you thought I was getting lazy or
something like that so make sure the
alert notification is active if you want
to be notified of our content as it goes
online and if you can give that like
button bit of a click I'd also very much
appreciate that okay so that's going to
do it for this one I hope you guys
enjoyed the comparison I'm your host
Steve see you again soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
