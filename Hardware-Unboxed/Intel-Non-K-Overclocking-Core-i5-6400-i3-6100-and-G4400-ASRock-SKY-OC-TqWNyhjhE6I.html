will be enabling overclocking support
for all non case Guide processors on
their z170 motherboards this is a
seriously big deal for a few reasons
firstly for the past five years
overclocking an on key Intel processor
has been futile with fully locked
multipliers the only way to boost the
frequency of an ankh a processor is to
increase the base clock and that hasn't
been proven terribly successful even for
the most experienced overclockers for
those of you not up to speed with base
clocks and multipliers here's a quick
explanation a cpu such as the core i3
6100 which operates 3.7 gigahertz
features a 100 megahertz base clock
multiplied 37 times resulting in the
3700 megahertz
operating frequency this multiplier is
only unlocked on the K processors such
as the 6600 K and 6700 K the base clock
has always been adjustable but
unfortunately the design of Sandy Bridge
Ivy Bridge and Haswell architectures
didn't lend themselves well to base
clock overclocking overclocking past 103
to say 105 megahertz wasn't really
possible doing so result in data loss
and consequently stability issues the
limitation comes from the fact that
these architectures link other parts of
the system to the base clock such as
storage in the PCIe interface it was
rumored that skylight would change all
of that and finally enable worthwhile
base clock overclocking the Skype design
now sees a chipset and PCIe fee to the
ronin clock domains meaning the base
frequency only affects the CPU cores
uncor cache integrated graphics and DRAM
despite the design changes this should
have made sky more accepting of higher
base clock frequencies we found the same
old story frequencies greater than 103
megahertz wouldn't even allow the system
to post this is what makes as Rob's
latest achievement really exciting is
expected they'll publicly release a new
biased revision for each and every one
of their z170 motherboards making it
possible to successfully overclock any
9k intel skylake processor I've been
lucky enough to acquire said bias for my
fatalities dead 170 gaming K 6 +
motherboard and after racing down to my
local computer store this morning I'm
now the proud
owner of a core i5 6400 and pentium g
4400 i also have a core i3 6100 on hand
as well previously these processes are
locked their default operating
frequencies which saw the pentium g 4400
operating at 3.3 gigahertz the core i3
6100 suck at 3.7 gigahertz and the core
i5 6400 running at 2.7 gigahertz
frequency with the turbo-boost speed of
up to three point three gigahertz
without rocks new base clock
overclocking bias we expect all three
processes to reach well over four
gigahertz and that's exactly what we
found the pentium g 4400 an Intel Core
i3 6100 both overclocked to a stable
four point six two gigahertz while the
Intel Core i5 6400 maxed out a four
point three two gigahertz still that's a
31% increase over the i-5 6400 turbo
frequency and a huge 40 percent
overclock for the G 4400 so now let's go
to the benchmark lab and see how these
overclocks translate performance wise
right away we see some nice performance
gains in 7-zip the g 4400 became 38%
faster the i3 6100 enjoyed a twenty two
percent performance gain in the i-5 6400
decent eleven percent performance gain
PC mark seven obviously isn't a heavily
threaded application as all three
overclock sky processors delivered a
similar score overclock the g 4400
almost matched the stock i3 6100 score
while the overclocked I 360 100 almost
matched the stock i5 6400 score
meanwhile the core i5 6400
multi-threaded score was boosted by 36
percent once overclocked the single
thread results were interesting and here
the G 4400 I 360 195 6400 all produced
similar scores which were also in line
with the core i7 6700 K Just Cause 3
doesn't play well with dual cores and
here we see the stock G 4400 dropping
down to a minimum of 20 FPS with the
radiant are no fury acts installed
overclocked the G 4400 game four frames
for the minimum frame rate and 36% more
performance from looking at the average
frame rate the i3 6100 did better out of
the box with the minimum 29 fps
but here much faster than the G 4400
even when overclocked boosting the i3
6100 to 4.6 to gigahertz increase the
average frame rate by just 12% I have to
say we're expecting a bigger boost here
the i-5 6400 started with an average of
57 frames and enjoyed a 16% performance
boost once overclocked hitting 66 FPS on
average that said it was still a percent
slower than the stock core i7 6700 K I'm
not sure why the AMD FX 8350 is showing
such bad performance in the ashes of the
singularity benchmark but it isn't
important for this test the game is
still in the beta phase as well so that
should be noted moving on we find the
overclocked G 4400 is 21% faster when
comparing the minimum frame rate while
the iPhone 6100 becomes 22% faster the
i5 6400 also saw a 21 percent
performance boost for the minimum frame
rate once overclocked and was actually
one frame per second faster than the
core i7 6700 K all our poor doesn't play
nicely with dual core processors at all
and the standard G 4400 gets absolutely
slayed overclocking certainly helps here
though while the minimum frame rate did
double it's still exceedingly slow at 20
fps the i3 6100 started at 26 FPS out of
the box and our overclock boosted that
result by 23% to 32 frames per second
the i5 6400 Rose overclocked to perform
almost on par with the core i7 6700 K as
the minimum frame rate increased by 27%
an impressive result indeed finally we
have some power consumption numbers
which were recorded using the Cinebench
r15 multi-threaded test please note that
these our entire system consumption
figures the G 4400 system consumed is 77
watts in that figure jumped by 47
percent once overclocked reaching 113
watts the i3 6100 started at just 84
watts and that figure jumped by 42%
reaching 119 watts once overclocked by
far the biggest power consumption game
was seen when overclocking the i5 6400
as a went from 91 watts to 174 watts a
massive 91% increase in 18% more than
the stock i7 6700 K so they
have it overclocking like it was the
good old days before we get too excited
let's put all of these results into
context it's important to remember that
this base clock overclocking support is
limited to Zed 170 motherboards and for
now as Roffe is the only board maker to
release the workaround bios that we
expect others to follow suit such as the
Zeus MSI and Super Micro for example as
it stands as rocks most affordable z170
motherboard cost 110 dollars around
twice that of the cheapest budget h1 10
motherboards typically we'd recommend
pairing a CPUs such as the core i3 6100
with an h1 10 motherboard at a combined
cost of around $190 adding a Zed 170
motherboard to the equation will inflate
that cost by over 25% with the
performance gains around the 20 to 25%
range at best there isn't much to gain
here the core i5 6400 on the other hand
only cost 20% more on the dead 170
platform we suspect most want to pair
the $190 processor with entails flagship
chipset overclocked to 4.3 gigahertz the
core i5 6400 wasn't a great deal slower
than the $340 core i7 6700 K in a number
of our tests therefore we feel that the
core i5 6400 and as Rob said 170 xtreme3
will make the ultimate $300 combo
coincidentally for a limited time the
asrock z170 pro 4s has just dropped to
80 dollars on newegg.com so that could
be a viable option for those in the
market for a skylight core i3 processor
although not as straightforward as
multiplayer overclocking the base clock
is still a relatively easy method all
three of our overclocks on the g 4400 a
360 100 and I 5 6400 proved very
reliable and we're confident these
overclocks will be the norm although it
means now save Intel updates the
processors microcode to disable the
overclock which Intel being Intel
they're likely to do thanks for watching
another installment of hardware unbox if
you haven't seen our 22-game benchmark
