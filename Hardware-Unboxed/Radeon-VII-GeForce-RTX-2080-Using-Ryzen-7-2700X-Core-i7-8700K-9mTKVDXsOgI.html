looking at a few different hardware
configurations to see if certain
matchups work better than others for
example when AMD Rison cpus first came
onto the scene back in early 2017 it was
discovered that for a large amount of
games these n based CPUs performed much
better when paired with a radeon GPU
opposed to a GeForce GPU of course the
only problem with that being at the time
the Radeon our X 480 was the fastest GPU
aimed he had to offer and given that it
was much slower than the geforce gtx
980ti and no one was using the radeon
GPU for cpu testing fast forward to
today and sadly the situation hasn't
changed all that much Amy's new flagship
GPU the Radeon 7 is only able to match
2017 s GTX nau TI making it much slower
than the RT x 28 DTI also you can't
currently buy one and that's been the
situation for a few weeks now thankfully
though we were provided a sample by AMD
so we at least have one for a few tests
before we get to that this video is
brought to you by as rock and there's ed
390 Taichi ultimate motherboard this
flagship quality board fully supports
Intel's ninth gen eight core processors
thanks to a 10 phase vrm design and you
get a quantity at 10 gigabit per second
Ethernet to learn more check out the
links in the description below I thought
it would be interesting to test out some
new and popular games using the horizon
7 2700 X and core i7 8700 K pair each
with the Radeon 7g force GTX 1080i and
r-tx 2080 as all three GPUs provide a
similar level of performance now the
focus of this video isn't an AMD versus
Intel CPU comparison we've done those
many many times in the past it's also
not a GPU comparison we've also done
those many times in the past so
basically the choice of CPU doesn't
really matter that much I could have
used a 2600 X or Core i5 8400 for
example doesn't really matter
not a cpu comparison rather what I'm
interested in here is monitoring the
performance margins does one CPU perform
better with a particular GPU
or is it now much of a muchness I should
also note that I've done all my testing
at forty or forty peers I wanted to
target a more realistic gaming
conditions again not a CPU test so
benchmark at 1080p or lower isn't a
priority then both the Intel and AMD
platforms were tested with 16 gigabytes
of ddr4 3200 cell 14 memory and any
performance enhancement features were
disabled just lastly all the benchmark
data is fresh and it was gathered
specifically for this video for the
GeForce GPUs driver version for 1917 was
used and for the Radeon 7 driver version
nineteen point two point three was used
okay let's get into the results starting
with Assassin's Creed Odyssey we see the
three GPUs are very evenly matched for
the average framerate when testing with
the 8700 K the radio and seven produces
the best one percent low figure here it
was 8 percent faster than the RT x 2080
moving over to the 2700 X and the one
percent low margin does grow quite
significantly here the radio and seven
is 17 percent faster than the RT X 20 80
and 11 percent faster than the GTX 1080
Ti it's very interesting to see churring
providing the lowest frame rates in this
test the average frame rates are around
9% law with the AMD CPU if the Radeon
seven for example saw the average frame
rate dropped by 11 percent and in the 1
percent low by 9 percent the RT X 20 80
saw the average frame rate dropped by 8
percent but the 1 percent low dropped by
17 percent so it's quite clearly
churring GPU isn't working that well
with the rise in processor at least in
this title anyway and we already know
that assassin's creed Odyssey really
isn't a good game this showcase verizon
with still it's interesting to note the
much weaker minimum frame rate
performance with the RT x 2080 moving on
to Apex legends here we're testing the
same section of the multiplayer mode and
taking an average from 3 separate runs
basically though this isn't a very CPU
demanding title at least when high-end
CPUs are involved we see very similar
results using either the 2,700 X or 87
or okay and the margins are also much
the same so all looks well here
the performance seen in battlefield 5 is
pretty much what you'd expect to see the
RTF 220 ATC is the biggest dip in the 1%
low performance when going from the 87
decade of 2700 X but this time that can
be attributed to the rise and cpu
creating a system bottleneck in this
game the same issue is seen when looking
at the average frame rate on the Radeon
seven so nothing unusual about these
results again pretty much what you'd
expect to see like apex legends Forza
horizon for isn't a particularly CPU
demanding game in fact we know this
title will happily run on a modern
dual-core such as the Athlon 200 GE
still I included it just to check if
there was any funny business going on
turns out there isn't so let's move on
now this is interesting when testing
with fortnight we see that both the GTX
tuner UCI and our GX 2080 provide better
1% low performance when paired with the
horizon 720 700 X quite significantly in
the case of the churring GPU this is in
stark contrast to the Radeon 7 which was
slightly slower for both the 1% low and
average framerate when paired with the
AMD CPU overall though the results were
very similar with the exception of the
1% low for the r-tx 2080
we discovered very early on that hitman
2 seems to really hate the horizon
processes which is a shame because the
original Hitman series running with
DirectX 12 worked rather well but for
whatever reason we went a bit backwards
with this second installment overall
though the margins between the various
GPUs remained much the same we're just
down around 20% with the AMD processor
performance in just cause fall looked
pretty standard I have to say the 2700 X
was slightly slower and this was seen
with all three GPUs so not much else to
report he really we also see a similar
story when testing with Metro Exodus the
higher clocked 87 ok has a slight
performance advantage and this is true
regardless of the GPU used the margins
are also much the same with performance
reductions around three to five percent
as was the case when testing with
fortnight we see that when testing with
project cars to the GeForce GPUs have
equivalent or slightly better 1% low
performance when paired with the
Eisen CPU while the opposite is true of
the Radeon seven granted the margins are
pretty small and I wouldn't read too
much into them certainly nothing like
what we saw with Assassin's Creed for
example okay moving on to Resident Evil
2 and when I first ran the initial batch
of tests with the rise in 720 700 X
there seemed to be an issue with the 1%
lower result so I reran them but I got
the same 60-ish FPS moving on to the
next GPU and I found much the same and
in the end after an average of 3 runs
for each configuration these are the
results for whatever reason the rise in
CPU suffered periods where the 1% low
would drop down to around 60 fps
meanwhile the 87 era came maintained
over 90 FPS this meant the 87 era K was
at least 54 % faster for the 1% low but
just 13% faster for the average frame
rate performance scaling in Rainbow six
siege was pretty consistent across all
tests at hardware configurations so not
much to report here really both the
2,700 X and 8700 K allowed these GPUs to
live a maximum performance or at least
within a few frames of it in the case of
the 2700 X surprisingly in the latest
version of World of Tanks the Rison 727
hundred x was a whisker faster than the
87 or okay and this was seen for all
three configurations the game has
recently been updated to take advantage
of multi-core processors and was
designed with Rison in mind so this is a
very promising result for AMD users
overall it seems like we're seeing
pretty balanced performance in 2019
nvidia appears to have improved driver
compatibility with AMD processors and
we're now seeing consistently strong
framerate on horizon based cpus at least
relative to an AMD GPU of similar
capabilities the only real outlier here
was Assassin's Creed Odyssey but as I
said earlier the Assassin's Creed series
have already been proven to run pretty
poorly on AMD hardware and this is
probably why AMD sponsored the latest
installment allows them to work a bit
more closely with the developer to
address some of the performance related
issues then as expected in tiles of
aren't very CPU intensive titles such as
apex legends
Forza horizon for fortnight Metro Exodus
and Just Cause for for example the
performance margins between the 2700 X
at 8700 K were very minor of course I
was testing at 1440p which tends to be a
little more GPU bound even with a GT X
1080 Ti class GPU but as I said this was
more of a system benchmark opposed to an
individual component test where we try
to remove any bottlenecks that could
limit the performance of the hardware
that we're examining anyway it was good
to see that overall performance margins
were consistent across the various GPUs
when using AMD and Intel processors and
that is going to do it for this one if
