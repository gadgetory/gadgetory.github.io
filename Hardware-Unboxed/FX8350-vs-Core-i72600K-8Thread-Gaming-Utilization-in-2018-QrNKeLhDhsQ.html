we're opening up an old AMG wound by
revisiting the FX 8350 and we will be
comparing it to probably the most
legendary cpu to be released in the past
decade the core i7 2609 ago we did
revisit the 2600 k and found that the
performance of the now seven-year-old
cpu was very respectable although it did
travel the latest and greatest eighth
generation 8700 k by a reasonable margin
when using an extreme gaming GPU such as
the GT x 1080 TI with the gtx 1070 or
something even slower the margin was
minimal
therefore I concluded that if you
currently own a 2600 Caine you are
willing to overclock it chances are
upgrading to an eighth gen core
processor won't get you much in the way
of extra performance at least for gaming
but before we get too far into the
comparison sponsoring today's video is
high low and I greatly appreciate their
support if you're after a respectable
broker to trade with I suggest checking
out halo registered since 2010 high/low

money to play with moreover if you saw
today high/low is offering the first 50
viewers an additional $50 so $100 on
total and this software is available for
the next four days so click the link in
the video description and check them out
right so when compared to the recent
2600 kaori visit the situation with the
FX 8350 might be a little different
despite packing more cos IPC performance
is down
and power consumption is way up this has
always been the problem of AMD's
bulldozer architecture and 2012 update
codename for sheriff featuring
piledriver cause didn't solve this I
concluded my review back in October of
2012 by saying this with AMD's
aggressive pricing the updated FX series
isn't necessarily in an indefensible
position against Ivybridge when purely
comparing speed and price but it's not
exactly an open-and-shut case either the
FX 6300 might offer 22% more performance
in the core i3 32:24 about the same
price but our piledriver powered test
rig also consumed 86% more power than
the Ivy Bridge machine 227 Watts versus
116 watts the bottom line is that the
piledriver FX series provides a quick
affordable upgrade for folks still using
lor√°nd k10 hardware but there isn't a
lot to see for those running high-end
phenom ii x4 + x6 processors regardless
of how cheap the new parts might be for
those building a fresh rig from scratch
ivory bridge will likely still be more
attractive thanks to its superior single
thread performance and efficiency so
almost five and a half years later here
we are games no longer used just two
cores and in fact we're starting to see
quad cores going out of fashion at the
high end so while the core i3 3220 might
have kept up with the 8 core FX 8350
back then it would likely struggle today
still a 55 watt part is hardly sport for
the mighty 125 watt FX processor so
we're putting up against the much older
95 watt 2600 k the following benchmarks
have been conducted with the core i7
2604 pointer key codes using ddr3 2133
memory then we have the FX 8350 clock
slightly lower at 4.7 gigahertz but
that's as high as I could get it and I
don't expect that true percent
difference in clock speed will amount to
much the FX process has been paired with
faster ddr3 2400 memory so that should
well and truly make up for the clock
speed deficit finally both the hyper
transport link and Northbridge frequency
you were overclocked to 2.6 kia hertz
for testing we have almost a dozen games
that were benchmarked at a range of
settings and resolutions using the gtx
1080 TI
so without wasting any more time let's
get to the results like all good
sessions we're starting with ashes of
the benchmark and here we see the FX
8350 isn't able to get anywhere near the
most out of the GTX 1082 a limiting
performance to around 70 FPS on average
this means best case the FX processor
was 16% slower than 2600 K and this
margin can be seen at 1440p when
comparing the average frame rate that
said though it was just 8% slower for
the 1% low result under this GPU
constraint s condition if we unleash the
GTX 1080i with the medium quality
settings at turn DP the FX 8350 is now
almost 30% solar for both the 1% low and
average frame rate or you could state it
by saying that the 2600 K was 40% faster
but that just sounds worse either way in
this heavily threaded title a 2600 K
appears to be vastly superior next up we
have a game has been putting torrent
sites out of business
that was until it was recently cracked I
am of course talking about Assassin's
Creed origins and its DRM for days here
we see the ultra quality settings were a
bit taxing on the bulldozer processor
and while it did keep frame rates above
30 FPS at all times
it was noticeably laggy when compared to
the 2600 K the higher quality settings
did allow for much smoother performance
though it was interesting to see that
downgrading to the medium quality
settings didn't really improve things
basically when GPU limited 1440p the FX
8350 was still 14% slower on average and
33% slower for the 1% low result so a
very comfortable win for the Sandy
Bridge processor moving on we have some
battlefield 1 single-player results and
yes we are testing the single-player as
it's impossible to accurately measure
multiplayer performance we can get a
rough idea but it's really not the most
accurate test as I can't control what
the other 60 plus players do and you
won't believe how many times people from
both sides completely dissipate by
benchmark orders so the single-player
results will have to do here the 2600 K
was 30 to 35% faster for the high and
medium quality tests and even at 1440p
with the ultra quality settings the FX
8350 was still around 20% slower than
intel's old quad-core the FX 8350 does
quite well in Call of Duty World War 2
despite trailing their 2600 K by a
reasonable margin and by this I mean the
resulting performance was very playable
interestingly even at 1440p the FX 8350
was still
three percents are for the average frame
rate that was only 13 percent slower for
the 1% low result but I'm not quite sure
why I'm saying only as that is still a
decent margin moving on we have Dawn of
War 3 and golly gosh what's going on
here then and I'm not talking about that
delightfully elegant expression
previously when comparing the 2600 K to
the 87 ok we did find that the older
Sandy Bridge CPU was almost 30% slower
in this tile and that was one of its
worst losses despite that though the
2600 K was still 56 percent faster than
the FX 8350 and that almost shouldn't be
possible Dawn of War 3 clearly isn't
optimized any shape or form for the
bulldozer architecture if you're
wondering why the frame rate doesn't
change between the various quality
sayings and resolutions even with the
2600 K the answer is simple we're
extremely cpu limited in this title even
at 4.8 gigahertz next up we have dirt 4
and this is a relatively harmless title
it's been helping budget cpus and gpus
feel good about themselves since June
2017 we see the demon at 1440p caresses
the FX 8350 along allowing for a minimum
of 60 FPS in fact as we continue to
become more and more GPU bound the 1%
low figures start to line the same note
can't be said for the average frame rate
looking at the average frame rate the FX
8350 was incredibly 34 percent slower at
1440p and 45 percent slower at 1080p so
while the FX processor was able to
deliver playable performance the 2600 K
was just on another level this would
probably be surprising if I hadn't
actually tested the game with the FX
series when it was first released last
year still it is surprising in the sense
that the Rison CPUs performs so well in
this title though I probably shouldn't
compare the effects of rising series as
they're in no way interchangeable moving
on from dirt 4 we have another racing
title and again things move faster when
powered by the 2600 K again although the
FX 8350 was able to deliver playable
performance it was still up to 24
percent slower at 1440p
however at 1080p the margins were often
around 30% as in the FX 8350 was 30%
slower so again we see another title
where the older 2600 K is just on
another level
the last racing title
tested his project cars - as we found
numerous times already the FX 8350 was
up to 30% slower or you could say 1440p
when comparing the average frame rate
the 2600 K was 43% faster
43% that's clearly a very significant
margin moving on things do look much
more competitive when testing with
Rainbow six siege in fact at 1440p
things managed to almost come together
yes I know we are heavily GPU limited
here but by Jo I'll take it at this
point at 1080p using the ultra quality
settings the FX processor was up to 20
percent slower but still this is one of
the better results we've seen capping
the benchmark session off we have total
war Warhammer 2 and again at 1440p the
FX 8350 is afforded the ability to catch
up here it's just 7% slower that said at
1080p using the ultra quality settings
it's now 16% slower and 23 percent
slower at high I'd say that went pretty
much as most of you would have expected
that seemed to be a one-sided beat down
and the older 2600 K was swinging the
hammer but to be sure let's quickly
check out their results across the ten
games tested to give us a clearer
picture of how the battle unfolded
well things honestly look very much how
I imagined it the FX 8350 was 19% slower
at 1440p using the ultra quality
settings 16 percent slower if we focus
on the 1% low result it might interest
you to know that the 2600 K was just 10%
slower than the 8th generation Core i7
87 era K for the average frame rate
under the same test conditions and 17%
slower for the 1% low result so this
means the 2600 K is closer to the 8700 K
in terms of gaming performance than the
FX 8350 is to the 2600 K now it's just
mind-blowing getting back to these
results though we see when using the
ultra quality type settings at 1080p the
FX 8350 is 26% slower on average and 21%
slower for the 1% low result these
margins continue to grow as we reduce
the quality settings by imagine you've
probably heard enough at this point okay
so I'm sure you get at this point
even after all these years the FX 8350
is much slower than the core i7 2670
probably not a real surprise that said
let's address a few things that might be
upsetting some FX owners who view this
video is just another chance to rag on
the FX series although much slower in
the vast majority of tests the FX 8350
did almost always deliver perfectly
playable performance so there is that I
often upset FX owners when I express my
honest opinion about the FX series that
being that I believe it's complete
garbage I always give my honest opinion
though about everything whether that be
Intel's hot and overpriced I like X
range or Nvidia stupidly named tight
next little P if you're a regular viewer
you'll know that the list just goes on
anyway I appreciate that the FX series
was cheap or at least it was discounted
to become very cheap the fx-8150 that
landed at $250 us and most of all I bet
a year later the FX 8350 landed at $195
us and most of all liked but eventually
they started going on sale for 150 to
160 dollars us and in early 2017 we're
often selling as low as 130 maybe even a
hundred and ten dollars us at that price
the eight core CPUs tempted some though
I recommended viewers who were
predominantly gaming pick up something
like a core i3 6100 instead and upgrade
later on or alternatively as the
evidence suggests you'd be better off
buying a second-hand Sandy Bridge ivory
bridge or even a Haswell system that
said I would just like to note that for
certain productivity workloads the FX
8350 does offer a reasonably good bang
for your buck but it is very application
dependent and power consumption is still
going to be that insane something we'll
look at in a moment of course now with
rising on the scene you'd be absolutely
mad to ever buy an FX processor for
productivity work a risin is genuinely
good and a great value choice for gaming
and productivity tasks getting back to
gaming many will argue that when paired
with a mid-range or low-end GPU the FX
8350 or any of its bulldozer relatives
are perfect as they are cheap and
provide playable performance it's my
opinion though that they're not in fact
they're terrible pairing with a low-end
graphics card because while your rx 560
is just sip
power the FX process is guzzling it like
a drunken viking this ultimately is the
real problem with the FX 8350 and the
entire FX series if it offered the same
performance per watt as the 2600 k or
was even in the same ballpark
but I might turn a blind eye to the
lackluster performance the problem
though is this playing ashes of the
singularity at 1080p using the crazy
preset the FX 8350 was 22% slower and
that's no small margin however in order
to deliver that lackluster performance
it gathered considerably more power
pushing total system usage 25% higher so
that's 22 percent less performance while
consuming 25% more power and that right
there is why the FX series was the
biggest disaster in AMD's history and
remember the 2600 K was released almost
two years before the FX 8350 not only
that but this is total system
consumption with an extreme 250 watt TDP
graphics card with an Rx 560 for example
that percentage margin will grow
considerably so what about application
performance is the FX series more
efficient there in a word no running the
Cinebench r15 multi-threaded tests we
saw the FX 8350 push system consumption
almost 60% higher 60% higher you might
be thinking but with those eight core
that probably scored higher right well
if you thought that you'd be wrong the
2600 K produced a score of 832 points
making it 15% faster
honestly the Cinebench r15 tests
combined with a power readout really
tells you all you need to know about
this comparison those power consumption
figures were taken with both CPUs
overclocked but don't think the FX
series is far less efficient once
overclocked stock you'll still see total
system consumption around 60% higher
with the FX processor so to recap my
problem with the FX series isn't just
that it's slower it's that it's slower
and consumes significantly more power
and let's be honest that's certainly not
a good thing and ultimately it led to
the FX series being a complete and utter
failure for AMD on that cheerful note
that's gonna do it for this one
