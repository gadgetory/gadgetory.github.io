around with an edifice speaker set
before I got my hands on this one and
I've got to say I'm impressed four ages
of what an awesome stylish set of
speakers in my office or bedroom that I
could easily connect to any Bluetooth
device as well as my PC and it seems
like these could be the answer I've been
searching for taking a quick tour around
the speaker's we find two forward-facing
drivers at the forefront behind a thin
transparent and removable grill the side
panels are finished with classic looking
wood panels the remind me of hi-fi
systems my parents had in the living
room growing up but with smooth modern
edges the top of the speaker's continues
the charcoal black panel from the front
that frames the two drivers and rounds
out the aesthetics nicely moving around
to the back we find the five and a half
centimeter ports for better bass
performance as well as the actual
speaker interface here we find three
knobs for controlling the bass treble
and volume as well as PC and auxilary
RCA inputs a coaxial port and an optical
port finally there's a power switch and
XLR connection at the bottom something
else have note is that you can switch
sources without the remote by pressing
the volume knob in as a button which is
pretty handy speaking of the remote it's
a very small unit at around 10
centimeters long it's nothing special
but features a few key buttons allowing
you to toggle power mute source and
control the volume for me the design and
color doesn't quite match the speakers
but to be honest I don't really care
about that personally as mentioned the
s1000 DB speaker set also comes with
Bluetooth connectivity which I love it
supports the awesome aptX codec - which
gives vastly superior wireless streaming
from compatible devices and I found I
could walk away with my phone around 10
meters
so overall the connectivity of this
Edifier set of speakers is pretty great
I'm not really sure what else you could
want now let's talk about the sound
performance as mentioned there are two
drivers on each speaker one a five and a
half inch 35 watt RMS mid-range and bass
driver and the other a one-inch titanium
dome 25 watt rms tweeter for treble I've
got to say these things sounded
absolutely awesome there is an absolute
ton of treble if you want it and the
bass is plentiful as well
it's not going to shake your whole house
obviously is it's not accompanied by a
10 inch plus subwoofer but it really is
quite powerful focused and very detailed
I did some pretty extensive testing with
lots of different kinds of music games
TV shows and movies and I found them to
be absolutely awesome for all of the
above there's a lot of volume too for a
bedroom or office and they'd really be
sufficient for most living rooms -
overall these speakers are absolutely
killer in terms of sound and
connectivity I couldn't really ask for
more I suppose the only negative for me
was the kind of cheap looking remote the
look of the speakers themselves though
is fantastic and if you've got some
wooden furniture around they'll fit in
beautifully price-wise they are too bad
right now either if you're looking for a
pretty premium speaker set coming in at
350 us on Amazon in Australia they're
listed at $700 on Edifier zone website
but I found them cheapest at slop tech
for 549 what do you guys think of these
