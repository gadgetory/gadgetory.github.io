thermal take the tower 100 build video
two weeks ago I showed you everything or
just about everything that was going
into this monstrous build then last week
we threw all the hardware and connected
the water blocks that attach the
fittings I was pretty happy with the end
results for now anyway because I can
certainly see myself wanting to throw
more hardware into this massive case
before too long anyway before I put any
major upgrade plans into action let's
finish the initial build because I do
have quite a bit of plumbing to do so is
that roll the tape
you
you
you
wow that is an amazing looking system
and I'm not patting myself on the back
when I say that I mean more in regards
to the hardware use that gigabyte said
to 70 gaming seven board just looks
incredible
I haven't even customized the RGB
lighting it but already I think it looks
pretty great of course it's the tower
nine hundred case that's really made
this build so impressive it's a
fantastic showcase and all that extra
thermal take liquid cooling gear and so
I certainly hasn't hurt either
speaking of thermal taken goodies they
did send something else over because
they thought that you know this is 2017
and you guys are probably sitting there
thinking Steve are they the only RGB
lights you've gotten this monstrosity
well thanks for Thermaltake that it
won't be to the case at least in a
moment I have their magnetic LED strips
RGB LED that is and I think there's so
there's six strips in total so I'm bout
to whack these in and we'll see how they
look
Wow okay that that really deserves a
well now in my opinion that looks pretty
spectacular I hope the camera is picking
it up as good as it looks in the flesh
because yeah those lights have really
made it such an impressive looking build
and unfortunately I don't really have a
purpose for it I'll have to work
something out because I want to keep
upgrading it and tinkering and doing
that sort of stuff but the build came
about because of Intel's 7th generation
processors and we thought they'd be not
hugely impressive but a little bit
exciting and you know that didn't really
chat to be the case and I had a spare
Core i7
77 ok processor on hand as they will
take we wanted to do some kind of
special crazy build to show off their
gear and KB Lake thankfully Thermaltake
ski came together and was quite exciting
not so much sofa cabe you like anyway I
would have liked to have done a giveaway
I'm sure there'll be plenty of you guys
saying you know if you don't know what
the system give it away and honestly I
would but I don't think I could afford
the shipping sending this thing overseas
would probably bankrupt the channel but
on a more positive note I will do a full
system build this year in 2017 that I'll
give away on the channel I just have to
work with a few other companies and yeah
arrange that but that'll be something
that I will definitely do this year we
thought I would just like to give a
really big THANK YOU to Thermaltake for
supplying so much of the gear that made
this build possible and forgive up for
sending over that amazing-looking Zed
270 gaming 7 motherboard and finally
Nvidia for pitching in with their
geforce gtx 1070 founders Edition
graphics card I hope you guys really
enjoyed the build series and please if
you did give me a like ahead leave some
feedback below I'm your host Steve and I
hope to catch you on another video
real soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
