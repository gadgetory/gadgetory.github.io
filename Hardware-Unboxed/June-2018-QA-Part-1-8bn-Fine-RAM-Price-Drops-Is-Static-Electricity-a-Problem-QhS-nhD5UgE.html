for the June Q&amp;amp;A we've got plenty of
questions lined up so I think we should
probably just get into them okay first
question will we see a drop in RAM
prices after the 8 billion dollar
scandal about price fixing I'll let you
handle that one Tim yeah I've sort of
been vaguely following this one I think
that eight billion dollar figure at the
MoMA is only really a theoretical
maximum amount for what they can find
them so it's not clear what amount
they'll actually be fined and even if
they'll be found guilty at all and I'm
you know usually these things there's
appeals and all that sort of process so
hopefully they'll scare many factors
into increasing supply for especially
consumer DRM and make prices go down but
you know it's always hard to save these
sort of things especially when it comes
to energy trust stuff yeah we'll just
have to wait and see
all right I'll read this next question
out and we'll get Tim to answer again
because it's again about the the eight
billion dollar fine for the DRAM
price-fixing since your answer the last
one you can handle this one as well
basically the question goes who will the
money go to and will this impact those
that have already bought memory at a
higher price so they give the GTX 970 as
an example there so will they be
refunded money assumes what they're
asking them yeah and I think generally
with these sort of price fixing things
in government investigations it doesn't
go back to the consumers it definitely
goes straight to the government so the
government I think in this case the
Chinese government will be getting a
nice payday there usually if you want to
get your money back you have to like
class-action sue them which I was the
case with the 970 yeah people got
together and sued them then NVIDIA was
forced to give the money back so yeah I
think there is a class action suit
happening for the DRAM stuff but
definitely this investigation will have
nothing to do with people getting their
money back
yeah unfortunately it always ends up
being more trouble that's worth for the
general consumer okay so you have a
question here on broken components have
you ever encountered a PC component
damage slash broken due to static
electricity
do you take precautions against this
happening yourself seems to me opinions
are split on the merits of static
protection
especially on the wristbands what do you
reckon uh well we we don't really have
much hardware that gets broken anyway
and definitely nothing that I could say
was judo static electricity yeah yeah so
I would say well we don't we don't take
any precautions so it's fair to say it's
really not practical when you're showing
a motherboard on camera we're holding
something or a stick of memories just
doesn't really work that well it doesn't
really make sense for what we're doing
because we haven't paid for the hardware
and in my opinion you have you'd be very
unlucky would you say yeah very um yeah
so I don't think it's a big deal
having said that if you'd paid me to
build a computer for you and it was your
hardware that I was dealing with then
yes we would take some safety
precautions just out of respect for your
stuff but for my own stuff I'm willing
to take the risk because it's just yeah
a lot easier to do our job that's a good
question here on the expectations on
future tech in general et gddr5 on newer
platforms is ddr5 near and will it
affect the state of risings
compatibility promises what would you
like to see from future hardware CPUs
GPS also storage chassis all that sort
of thing hmm okay I'll start with that
one
I don't think we're expecting mainstream
support for ddr5 for quite a few years
yet so it's exciting stuff but it's
probably going to be a few years before
we're really benchmarking with it and
seeing it used regularly so it'll be
great for rise and I think it'll
probably help solve a lot of problems
there and I think compatibility be quite
good because rise it'll be established
and it won't be like the whole starting
from scratch with ddr4 as what we really
want to see I think at the moment it's
fair to say we really want to see new
GPU technology so we're sort of hanging
out for that from Nvidia and AMD so I
think that'll be exciting in particular
next year and well hopefully that ends
up arriving before before ddr5 does
because like says that'll be a few years
away we should have some new GPUs in
that time oh and as for storage and
cases that stuff doesn't really excite
us too much on the channel high speed
storage is always great but it's often
hard to show the advantage of that for
gamers so don't get too excited about
that in cases don't really excite us too
much either so again it's really the
GPUs and
cpu's we're keen to benchmark any new
GPS or CPUs that come our way okay next
question pretty simple one here why
don't we review our audio cards so those
sound cards basically I have no personal
interest or really expertise in audio
and sound cards so don't really care to
be testing them out and I think the main
reason I haven't got into the more
excited about them is because I think
most of you guys feel the same way as
well I'd say most of our audience
doesn't really care about reviews on
sound cards and probably most of you
guys don't use them and it seems to be a
split thing people either swear by
having a sound card or just say that's
rubbish waste of money I'm happy with on
board they're certainly good but you
have to want to knit you we have to have
a one for what I suppose or one need
yeah a bit of an itch thing these days
over thought I would have thought so
so okay next question that same as many
game developers have been hesitant to
fully embrace DirectX 12 even threes
into its release is this due to the
requirement for Windows 10 or the
overwhelming amount of people who
dislike that OS and a store on Windows 7
if so do you think DirectX 12 will ever
be made backwards compatible for 7 and
Windows 7 sorry
and how about future DirectX releases
yeah I'm not sure there's overwhelming
dislike for Windows 10 both of us use it
and finally that's fine and you know
according to the steam highway survey
more than half of all game is running
Windows 10 and only 35 percent of gamers
actually have a DirectX 12 compatible
GPU but aren't running Windows 10 ok
it's probably pretty interesting that
made that decision but that's for them I
guess but the actual reason we aren't
seeing more dx12 games it's much more
complex to code for dx12 cuz it's much
closer to the metal you need have a lot
more expertise to use the API compared
to DirectX 11 so I don't really think
the you know restriction of Windows 10
is holding developers back it's just
it's more complex and a lot of engines
that are currently being used is still
sort of similar to the DirectX 11 era so
yeah I think once we start seeing more
game engines getting refreshed we'll
start to see more DirectX 12 as we're
porting it back to Windows 7
I don't think Microsoft has any
incentive at all to do that definitely
won't happen so probably
what happened and all future direct exes
as well I think will be you know
restricted to whatever is the latest
generation OS so ya can't see Microsoft
doing that okay next question do you
think with the nanometer advancements of
AMD will there be a grand shift in
market share consumer and enterprise
yeah it's not really AMD that are
specifically making the process
advancements that's more TSM saying I
think specifically Global Foundries for
AMD but if only you know if they can get
good gains out of seven nanometer Intel
if they continue to struggle with their
10 nanometer and lower until definitely
struggle to compete on you know
performance and power consumption with
their new chips so that could bring
about a shift in market share in both
segments for AMD in their favor but you
know it's it's hard to say what'll
happen there with both those countries
you know Intel could come out and
suddenly have a working 10 nanometer and
they'll be competition again and Amy's
also doing other cool stuff you know
with multi die technology so yeah I
think that it'll definitely even up in
terms of market share but will there be
a big shift it's always hard to say I
have to say short term I think it's
definitely going to be advantage AMD by
the sounds of it yeah but beyond that
yes
alright this is a good question for you
Steve does GPU power really matter these
days for gaming considering you can
lower the settings and have a decent
gameplay experience even with the GTX
1050 okay well yeah I don't think
anything's really change that you've
always been at a lower the quality
settings so that's not something new
although not a game developer I imagine
they basically have a look at the
hardware that's available at the time of
releasing their game and through the
development process and they'll make
that game designed for that hardware so
you're ultra type quality settings will
be for your GT X 1080 T eyes to ten
eighties in Vegas 60 for the high
quality settings will work on your
mid-range cards the 1060 DRX 580 and
then you sort of medium to lower
settings will work on your GT x 1050 as
you've said so nothing really different
there there's just games are designed to
scale across a wide range of PC hardware
all right next
question what's better for a college
student in dorms a gaming laptop or
desktop it's my first time getting a PC
and getting a dorm congratulations I'm
not sure which is better for the
situation yeah I mean I haven't used a
lot of gaming laptops are white gaming
laptops but if you're on a budget gaming
desktops they're almost always more cost
effective in terms of you know getting
performance for your dollar and of
course you can upgrade them so you can
choose to you know put in a really
budget especially AMD CPU and then you
know continue to upgrade that as you go
and you can make them pretty compact as
well with so yeah your mini systems so
unless you want to specifically play
multiple games in multiple locations
like you know in your dorm and then in
your lecture theater when you're not
paying attention
I think the desktop is is the way better
choice absolutely yeah it's pretty
simple that one if you need the gaming
system to be portable yeah and it has to
move around with you whether you want to
use it on the train or whatever then you
have to get a laptop but if the laptop
is pretty much gonna sit in your dorm
room just to play games on then you're
far better off with a desktop PC yep so
it's really simple all right what does
Tim and Steve do to wind down after a
long day unboxing the benchmark good
question
I personally usually go to bed okay yeah
yeah getting a bit too old for it now I
am when I've finished up I usually go
spend some talk my family I've got two
young girls so go play with them and
then I go to bed yeah I just I don't
have kids so I'm unlucky good idea yeah
no one to bother me when I'm finished my
benchmarking so I just sit around watch
TV play some games build some logo yeah
build some Lego all that fun stuff so
yeah then I go to bed probably a bit
later than you cuz your old man who's
got a hard life okay next question I
like this one
did the dislikes on the joke 20/80 video
affect the channel at all well oh yeah
we'll find out in a few days for sure
once we get the detailed stats from
YouTube but the not really at this point
I think the YouTube algorithm doesn't
really take into account likes and
dislikes all that much compared to at
least a few other metrics that we know
of so we probably did lose a
you subscribers who didn't get the joke
video and we've been annoyed at our
clickbait but you know overall we had a
fairly normal day in terms of you know
subscribers and we got good traffic on
the video so it's where I was where
concern obviously it's always
disappointing to get a video that has
the most dislikes ever but really in
terms of our traffic and everything I
don't think I'll have too much of an
impact no I'm not too concerned about it
it didn't come off probably as well as
we were hoping it would but it probably
came off as well as we thought it might
yeah we knew they were gonna be lots of
dislikes yeah yeah we knew it probably
wouldn't be that well-received but the
patreon members were really pushing us
to do it and we thought it was funny I
had fun making the video and I thought
it was quite funny and I also thought
that for and I think this is probably
true for our core audience most of our
subscribers the thumbnail probably gave
away that it wasn't a serious video and
the title even the original title was
quite silly even just ten seconds into
the video and ten seconds in when you
know I said welcome back to Hardware
fabricated out of thin air I thought
that was probably going to set a few
people off and then I think it was
probably only about thirty seconds after
that I said we got all this information
from a booth babe that whispered it in
Tim's here I thought by that point it
would have been crystal clear but
apparently not so anyway we had fun
making it don't really regret it still
it's not a lot of dislikes but it's
still got a lot of likes so yeah you
probably when you do a video out for a
bit of fun you're always going to upset
a few people that sort of seem to upset
all the people that love the rumors that
really wanted legit info from us sorry
guys it's not something we're gonna make
a habit of yeah yeah okay this is this
is a really interesting question I think
every time there's a new arm process
from Qualcomm or Apple massive
performance gains advertised how do they
manage to make so much progress in a few
months are these performance claims
fabricated with special benchmarks why
aren't x86 based processes development
on pace anywhere near that of arm
processes so yeah really interesting
question
there's a couple of reasons for it and I
don't really think it's due to special
benchmarks or cheating or anything like
that it's just simply down to ARM
processors are a lot more simple
compared to x86 in terms of their
architecture and there's a lot of
performance
tricks in x86 has been developed over
the years that haven't yet made the
transition to arm even now things like
boost clocks are not really a thing with
ARM processors so with each new ARM
processor they're sort of adding in some
of these things from x86 and the lessons
learned with other architectures to sort
of improve performance and and on top of
that you know arm processes are
benefiting a lot from new process
technologies that are specific to
low-power chips so things that wouldn't
be suitable for you know Intel AMD you
know high-power CPUs things like Samsung
10 nanometer for example so they're
often accessing those new nodes and on
top of that they're adding an extra
tricks each time making the CPU cores
wider and doing all that sort of thing
x86 is probably a bit closer to being
tapped out in terms of in terms of its
like performance tricks and different
things they can do it's mostly just you
know clock speeds and cause at this
point so yeah that's why I think x86 is
a bit slower and we seem to see you know
30 percent each generation with arm
which is certainly very impressive hmm
all right another question here what
games you guys play in your spare time
if any yeah when we have some time
yeah if any there keywords there well I
used to play a lot of Starcraft 2 which
I know quite a few of you are aware of
now and I really enjoyed that game
playing that quite seriously but I
haven't opened up Starcraft 2 now for at
least six months I've been playing the
odd game here and there I played a
little bit of fortnight had a lot of fun
with that that's a pretty cool game but
you never really got a handle on how to
play that one really well I've I'm gonna
play battlefield 5 when that comes out
I've been playing a little bit of
overwatch lately I always enjoy
overwatch I keep coming back to that one
so I've got into it a bit more recently
than I have so in the past but yeah
that's a good one
but sadly between benchmarks and whatnot
and doing the channel is not a lot of
time for gaming as we sort of alluded to
at the start of this question so yeah
what about YouTube yeah I'm I'm enjoy
like the multiplayer games like
Starcraft and not as much into like 49
overwatch I play a bit but more into you
sort of battlefield so definitely
battlefield 5 comes Arial we're getting
some matches together yeah things like
stars battlefront - all that sort of
games that play there is but
sort of like the single-player games
like your role playing games just sort
of Assassin's Creed type games okay so
yeah I tend to just smash some of those
out it's a lot of fun just to sit there
and play some single-player games just
to decompress after some work so yeah
it's not bad but again you know not that
much time to do it so now squeezing in
here and there yeah that's good to take
a bit of a break and have a bit of a
gaming session but gone are the days of
the the 10-hour gaming session I said
like a weekend day for free or something
that okay we're gonna hit pause on the
Q&amp;amp;A for now we've had a good amount of
questions answered there I think and
we'll pick this up again probably
tomorrow depends on when to answer this
I'll get to me to edit it and yeah we'll
see how he goes but anyway don't forget
to hit like subscribe do all that stuff
and we will see you again another QA
really soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
