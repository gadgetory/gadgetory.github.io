every time I put together a benchmark
video looking at how a new game performs
much like ideas last week with Ferg
honor quite a few of you asked me to do
the same for Ark survival evolved so I
have been meaning to do this for a long
time now over the past week I've been
testing the current generation lineup of
AMD and NVIDIA graphics cards in our to
see how they perform just briefly for
those of you unaware Ark survival
evolved is an open-world action
adventure survival video game currently
in development by Studio wildcard in
cooperation with instinct games efecto
studios and virtual basement currently
the game is scheduled for release on
PlayStation 4 Xbox one Microsoft Windows
OS X and the Linux sometime this year
however many have been testing the game
for years now as early access began back
in June 2015 in the game players must
survive being stranded on an island
filled with roaming dinosaurs and other
prehistoric animals natural hazards and
potential hostile human players the game
is powered by the Unreal 4 game engine
and the open-world environment contains
tens of thousands of artificial
intelligent entities according to the
developers the game has certainly
received a great deal of attention and
we think just one month of going on sale
the early access produced over 1 million
sales by August 2016 the game had over 4
million sales on the PC platform alone
gamers really seem to be loving Ark
survival evolved that said there is one
thing about the game that most aren't
loving and that's the performance it
seems like for the most part the focus
has been on the content first with
optimization hopefully coming later
that's obviously not a bad thing but
with so many gamers addicted to the
title they are willing to upgrade naught
to achieve better performance so this
video I have just tested the current
generation GPUs and this still took a
serious amount of time to do as I tested
not just the epic but also the high and
medium quality presets at 1080p at hands
1440p once the game is in better
condition or at least released at retail
I will retest using the current and
previous generation GPUs as well as
tested before Kay resolution the testing
was conducted using the core i7 7700 K
test rig
which runs the processor at 4.9
gigahertz with 32 gigabytes of ddr4 3000
memory that said the CPU shouldn't
really impact performance too heavily
only a single thread was really used on
our core i7 processor which is a bit
surprising
and as a result total CPU utilization I
only hovered around 30 percent the
Pentium G 45 60 for example provided
similar results even with the Titan XP
just to be clear we are actually looking
at 1080p performance here yeah so to say
the game is currently unapplied would be
quite the understatement only the Titan
XP was really only able to deliver
perfectly smooth performance with the
epic preset and play and frankly the
graphics aren't even that great the GTX
980 was 27% file with an average of just
40 fps meanwhile the GTX 1070 only
provided performance that could be
considered just playable beyond that the
game plays like mafia 3 on release day
something I found both interesting and
very odd was the fact that increase in
the resolution didn't seem to reduce the
frame rate by all that much I'm not
entirely sure what the holdup was at
1080p but it seems like those with
higher end GPUs might as well play at
1440p lowering the resolution probably
won't help improve frame rates in an
effort to boost performance I did drop
down to the higher quality preset and
this had a profound impact the Titan XP
for example is now 82 percent faster
hitting 100 FPS on average in fact all
graphics cards enjoyed a significant
performance boost the Radeon rx for a 8
gigabyte for example is now 73% faster
though it's still on the average 38 fps
in fact for decent performance at tiny
pv gtx 1070 is still called for this
time increasing the resolution did have
a more noticeable impact on performance
at least for the higher-end graphics
cards oddly once again though we did see
that the mid-range and lowering cards
only dropped a few frames per second and
i'm not really sure how to explain that
ok so now using the medium quality
settings we find that usually capable
GPUs such as the rx 470 and GTX 1066
gigabyte still aren't able to achieve a
60 FPS average Nvidia does appear to do
slightly better but even so the
performance clearly isn't very good once
again we see that for the most part
scaling is very strange when ramping up
the resolution the GTX 1066 gigabyte for
example drops just 3 FPS on average
despite having a deal with almost 80%
more pixel
as I was wrapping the testing up I
thought it might be interesting to see
how a pair of tighten XP graphics cards
run in SLI since the resolution doesn't
seem to impact performance that much I
went straight to 4k for the testing the
darker blue bar shows the GPU usage as
reported by MSI Afterburner
and as you can see the usage wasn't that
high usage was virtually identical on
both GPUs so I just took the average
using the epic preset we only saw 75%
utilization on the Titan XP graphics
cards and this allows 63 fps as you can
see as I reduce the quality preset the
framerate did increase though
interestingly GPU utilization fell away
well I hope that was somewhat useful for
you guys who have been requesting an arc
benchmark and it seems like if you are
having performance issues the best thing
to do is downgrade the quality settings
hardly surprising I know but what was
surprising was the fact that lowering
the resolution won't help or at least
doesn't really seem to help much didn't
in my case which is bizarre and I
honestly don't really know how to
explain that or what's going on there
and I haven't really invested a whole
lot of time playing the Oh messing
around with it I just unfortunately
don't have time what I can tell you is
the game isn't particularly CPU
demanding at least if you're using a
relatively modern Intel processor
something else worth noting is that 8
gigabytes of system memory probably
isn't enough the game will gobble up all
eight gigabytes right away
therefore sixteen gigabytes seems to be
the minimum for running this title
actually the game is a bit of a memory
Pig all around vrm is also heavily used
if available the game will consume over
four gigabytes at 1080p and over five
gigabytes at 1440p finally at the time
of testing crossfire didn't appear to be
working at least it wasn't with a pair
of our X 480
obviously SLI is working as we tested
this on a pair of Titan XP graphics
cards and scaling is quite good in fact
it's probably about the only way gamers
can hope to play this game using decent
quality settings anyway I have no idea
how many of you guys actually wanted to
watch this video and see a benchmark for
the game but for those of you who have
been requesting it I hope the
information included was worthwhile if
you are a fan of the game and want to
see more in-depth breakdown upon release
please let me know in the comments below
and I'll look at making that happen I'm
your host Steve catch again soon
