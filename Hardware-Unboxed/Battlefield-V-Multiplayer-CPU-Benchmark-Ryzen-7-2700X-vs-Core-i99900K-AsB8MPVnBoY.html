recently we checked out battlefield 5 GP
performance using a massive range of
graphics cards at TP 1440p and 4k for
that test we used the single-player
campaign as it's just a quick and easy
way to accurately record the data we
needed and visually these single and
multiplayer portions of the game are
much the same however there is a big
difference when it comes to the demand
on the CPU between single and
multiplayer particularly when using the
64 player multiplayer modes that puts
the hurt on lower and processors so for
this CPU performance video we will be
using a 64 player mode we'll be playing
in the conquest Maps this creates a few
challenges for testing firstly the
fluctuation between runs can be quite
large our battlefield 5 single-player
benchmark often delivers the same
average framerate over and over again
and the same is also true for the 1%
lower result with high-end Hardware a
deviation of more than a few frames is
quite rare testing with multiplayer
though I did sometimes see up to a 10
FPS difference for the average framerate
having said that I did neglect any
extreme outliers and I tested many more
times that I normally would to try and
report the most accurate performance I
could so the results are based on an
average of 6 runs rather than 3 because
of this I feel watching gameplay footage
of two different harbour configurations
executing a similar pass our
side-by-side is next to useless so I
won't be doing any of that for example
if you've got 30 players relatively
close all engaging in battle the frame
rates will be much lower than if the
action was taking place off in the
distance and you're perhaps off by
yourself so making sure these same sort
of stuff is going on around the player
character for each pass was a serious
challenge and extremely time consuming
for testing I'm using the Narvik map in
the 64 player conquest mode the test
runs for 60 seconds and I'm reporting
the average framerate along with the 1%
low frame time result again the results
are based on an average of at least six
runs and any extreme outliers were
removed ok so that's getting the results
for most of this testing I'll be using
DirectX 11 as it provides more
consistent frame time performance I know
plenty of you are claiming that DirectX
12 is now fixed and is better than
DirectX 11 but unless you're using a
really low end CPU DirectX 11 does offer
a better experience anyway here the
DirectX 12 numbers for those of you
interested I'm not going to discuss
these results as my focus will be on the
slightly better performing DirectX 11 so
if you want to study these figures for
yourself feel free to pause the video
now okay so here all the CPUs retest
using the DirectX 11 API and as you can
see rising cops a bit of a pounding
under these conditions the core i5 8400
is roughly on par with the rise in 720
700 X while the oldest 77 Rek is faster
beyond that we see processes such as the
8600 k 8700 a 9600 k and so on all
easily beating the best AMD has to offer
still with well over 60 FPS at all times
rise and did provide smooth perfectly
playable performance and I'll move on to
some more favorable testing in a moment
it's really interesting to see the
once-mighty Core i5 7600 K really
struggling and it's easily done in by
the Rison 520 600 X in fact the Rison
520 400 G was comparable to the 7600 K
that's not something we often see if
ever then we see the rise in 322 energy
comfortably beating the core i3 70 350 K
and penny mg 5400 basically anything
dual core is going to get destroyed by
the quad core 2020 even if they have
hyper threading for example so a decent
change from AMD the low-end but not
great for the high end that said if
you're not using an RT X xx 82 at 1080p
with ray tracing disabled what does
risin have to offer okay so here's a
comparison between the Rison 727
hundreds and corer 999 hundred K at the
top of the graph we see the previous RT
X xx atti results at 1080p and here we
see the Intel CPU offered a 16%
performance boost for the average frame
rate and 18% for the 1% low result so a
decent performance advantage offered by
Intel here
switching to the RT X 2080 didn't change
too much and here we're still mostly CPU
bound at 1080p the 1900 K while
11% faster for the average framerate and
15% faster for the frame time result so
for those of you seeking maximum
performance at 1080p the 99 are ok seems
like the way to go
however if you're using a more mid-range
GPU like the RT X 2070 so a $500 GPU
then it appears you'll receive a similar
level of performance with either the
2700 X or 9900 K here the Intel CPU was
just 2% faster for the average frame
rate and 5% faster for the 1% low which
is a negligible difference that being
the case using any GPU that's slower
than an RT X 2070 I will see no
difference between these two CPUs at
iupi using ultra quality settings and we
see that to be the case with the gtx
1070 but what if you want to go at 1440p
and that resolution certainly seems more
fitting for the 4 GPUs tested here well
at 1440p we see very little difference
between the 2700 X and 9900 K using the
gtx 1070 RT x 2070 and even at the RT x
2080 the 9900 case still offered a
superior gaming experience at 1440p when
using the RT X xx atti
here it was 13% faster on average with a
21 percent greater frame time result
still for most gamers spending twice as
much on the 99er okay seems like a poor
investment now assuming you actually
purchased that 20 80 TI for 4k gaming
and appears the choice of CPU doesn't
really matter that much here at least
when comparing high-end AMD and Intel
models even with the RT X xx atti both
CPUs enabled the same level of
performance hitting around 80 FPS on
average with a 1% low of 65 fps ideally
I would have liked to have done more
testing for this video but due to the
ridiculous amount of time it does take
to conduct these multiplayer tests and
the fact that I only have well I have a
couple of accounts but you are limited
after 5 hardware changes on an Origin
account so you change a graphics card or
a CPU five times or even disable
something like hyper threading or
whatever to test certain things out that
will constitute as a hardware change so
even though I've got a few accounts I
was pretty much maxing them out every
day that I was able
test with this and then you gotta wait
24 hours before you can do any more
testing very annoying it wastes a lot of
my time it's very inefficient anyway
despite all that I will continue to
benchmark other CPUs upon request so if
there is a CP you'd like to see added to
this list I will do my best to make that
happen I'm also going to look at doing a
look at including different test
conditions so perhaps different maps and
modes and things like that because
testing with battlefield 5 4 CPUs is
quite interesting I think but anyway I
think this is a pretty good starting
point and we have some pretty good data
here anyway the game is playable on quad
cores but you can expect frequent frame
dips and resulting in less consistent
frame rates for the most part we've
found that the older Core i5 7600 K has
been hanging in there pretty well with
triple-a titles released in 2018 but for
the multiplayer portion of battlefield 5
you'll will want to avoid the big 64
player battles this also means for
smooth consistent gameplay the core i3
range along with the quad core rising
CPUs are pretty much a write-off of
course if you're willing to accept a
regular stuttering and dips below 60fps
then you can still make do with these
processors now if I was building a PC
just to play battlefield 5 at the
highest possible frame rates with
absolutely nothing else in mind I'd
probably get a core i5 8600 K but for
just $10 less than the rise in 720 700
you'd really have to be doing nothing
other than playing battlefield 5 and
you'd have to be completely ignoring
future upgrade options for any concerned
AMD fans I would like to just point out
that the horizon 7 2700 also comes with
a cooler and yes I agree that overall it
is much better value but for just
playing battlefield 5 and a higher
refresh rate display the 8600 K can
offer a better experience of course if
he gave me with an RT X 27 you're slower
using the ultra quality settings then it
doesn't really matter and in my opinion
you're better off getting a rise in
protesser as they are better value
especially at the lower end
alternatively though if you're willing
to drop the quality settings down a high
or even medium for maximum frame rates
then you'll start to see a benefit from
going with the higher clocked lower
latency into
CPU also keep in mind that both AMD and
Intel CPUs can be overclocked for
greater performance and things like
memory timings can be manually tuned and
this is beneficial for both platforms
generally speaking AMD does better with
memory tuning while Intel gains more
from core overclocking that being the
case it would be possible to push the
horizon 720 700 X a more into GPU
limited territory with some memory
tuning but as always with overclocking
your mileage will vary overall I'd say
while the rice and results look a bit
disappointing at 1080p with extreme
high-end GPUs given the clock speed
deficit the fact that the 2700 X is just
15% slower than the 99 RK is actually
rather impressive and while that is
