today I have the real deal that 30 GPU
destiny to benchmark for you now for
testing we're obviously using the beta
version of destiny 2 and access was
granted on August 29th for those that
pre-ordered the game the retail release
won't be until late October so in a few
months time but even so it was great to
take a peek at what we're in for both
AMD and NVIDIA have released updated
drivers to better support destiny 2 and
they did this about a week ahead of the
PC open beta I found performance was
excellent on both the Radeon and GeForce
GPUs as you're about to see for testing
I have again used our core i7 7700 GPU
test system and that is again clocked at
4.9 gigahertz but I also found the game
played very well a much more affordable
CPU such as the pentium g 45 60 and
Rison 3 1200 for example if you missed
yesterday's what does it take to play
video which was based on destiny 2 now
let me just quickly say that with the
geforce gtx 1060 we found the game
played exceptionally well using AMD's
Rison 3 1200 and that was without
needing to overclock the CPU i've also
looked at the risin 5 1600 and we will
compare those numbers to the mighty core
i7 77 ok later in the video for now we
do have 30 GPUs to focus on 17 of which
are from the current generation lineup
with another 13 from last season's
lineup all have been tested at the 1080p
1440p and 4k resolutions using the
higher quality preset which is the
second highest quality preset available
in the game right now the highest
quality preset which is called highest
completely smashes performance visually
I didn't really notice a huge difference
between the high and highest quality
presets so for that reason I've decided
to go for high for now and this means
that SMA is the anti-aliasing method of
choice since you can't save your
progress during the beta sort of it's
like a single player toriel style intro
I've tested the first 60 seconds from
the very start and I'll show you what
the past looks like now having done this
over 90 times now I have it pretty well
memorized
testing this game though was a massive
pain I had to exit after every single
run to reset everything it was insanely
time-consuming as you can probably
imagine I do hope that when the game is
finally released we can find a
significantly more efficient method to
test for now I haven't tested the
multiplayer section of the game mostly
because I found getting into a game took
way too long so I abandoned that plan
pretty early on
anyway let's watch the rest of the
benchmark pass and then we'll get down
to business as we have a lot of data to
go over - a short dick
over here Titan high armory is opened
follow the path from there it will lead
you through the hangar to the plot first
up we have the old boys the geforce 900
series along with the radio and 300 and
furry series testing at 1080p we see
that most of the previous generation
GPUs had no trouble maintaining well
over 60 FPS at all times as demonstrated
by the Radeon r9 390 and GeForce GTX 970
even the r9 380 and gtx 960 do well
averaging over 60 FPS it's interesting
to see that the fury series was not
really able to pull ahead of the r9 390x
and in fact trailed the gtx 980 and it
got completely stomped by the gtx 980ti
fine wine ain't working here moving on
to 1440p the fury ik series does start
to recover though even here the fury ax
is still down on the gtx 980ti meanwhile
the GTX 970 edged ahead of the r9 390
though it has to be said both did
provide exceptionally smooth frame rates
in fact quite shockingly even the
geforce gtx 950 managed to keep frame
rates above 30fps for a slightly con
soulish feel I suppose though the
graphics and resolution were
considerably better then finally for the
previous gen GPUs we tested at 4k and as
expected you'll ideally want a previous
generation flagship part such as the gtx
980ti or fury X for playing at this
resolution the mid-range to high-end
models such as the GTX 970 and r9 390
did well but again you'll probably want
more horsepower for 4k gaming ok so what
about the current generation GPUs yeah
there's quite a lot of them now AMD
might be lacking a truly high end GPU
but they're still pretty competitive in
overall numbers ignoring the high-end
stuff for now as we are only at 1080p we
find that to keep the frame rates above
60fps at all times gamers will require
an rx 570 or GTX 1063 gigabyte and
frankly those are some pretty mild
demands
for now though nvidia does have a clear
advantage in this title at least at
these lower resolutions and we see this
when comparing GPUs such as the rx 580
and GTX 1060 for example moving on as we
increase the resolution to 1440p this
greatly reduces the margins between the
AMD and NVIDIA GPUs and we now just see
three frames standing between the GTX
1060 and rx 580 both of which provided
excellent performance at this reasonably
high resolution for an average of around
100 FPS you will want to seek out a gtx
1070 or Vega 56 GPU and for going well
beyond 100 fps you will of course
require a gtx 1080 TI and finally if you
want to enjoy destiny - in all of its
glory at 4k then and get your wallets
out and prepare to empty them actually
it's probably not really that bad and in
fact the GTX 1080 actually does very
well here
of course the 1080 TI was much smoother
thanks to a 33% increase in frame rates
and it did push well over 60 FPS at all
times but still the game appears very
well optimised before wrapping things up
as usual I have this giant mess for you
to try and decipher with a magnifying
glass for easier to digest versions of
this very graph head over to text spot
I'll provide the link in the video
description anyway here are all 30 GPUs
compared at 1080p and as you can see
there are a number of options capable of
delivering between 96 105 fps on average
and that being the case there are a
great deal of GPUs that are good for
60fps plus we do see a wider spread of
results at 1440p and again there are a
huge amount of GPUs capable of pushing
over 60 fps
that said though those seeking a hundred
FPS or greater will either need to back
the quality settings down or up for a
very high end GPU and finally we again
have the 4k results with the high
quality preset enabled if you want to
average around 60fps your options are
admittedly quite limited the best value
choice here is quite clearly the GTX
1080 but damn the TI version was very
nice in this title at 4k just lastly
before wrapping things up I did throw in
the GTX 1080
on both the 7700 K and risin 5 1600 test
systems to see how they compare now
these results are only from the first 60
seconds of the single-player campaign
and I am aware that larger open sections
of the game as well as the multiplayer
modes will likely be more CPU demanding
but until the game is officially
released I can't really test that so for
now this will have to do as expected at
4k we run into a massive GPU bottleneck
and performance is much the same
though the 7700 K did still maintain a
better 1% low result moving to 1440p the
Intel CPU did offer a 15% greater
performance margin and this was blown
out to 27% at 1080p utilization was good
on both CPUs and the game did evenly
distribute load across all the r5 1600 s
cause it just didn't give it enough work
to warrant having all those extra cores
for this title at least under the
conditions we tested as I noted anyway
on that note expect a much more in depth
destiny 2 CPU benchmark once the game is
officially released well I have to say
although I haven't had a chance to check
out the multiplayer portion of the game
yet I was pleasantly surprised by what I
found in the single-player experience
the game looks great plays well and for
a beta I have to say it's significantly
more polished than most of the triple-a
titles I tested last year so hats off to
the developer for an enjoyable
single-player experience a mid-range GPU
will have you more than covered at 1080p
using the higher quality settings and
many will provide a very smooth 60fps
experience even at 1440p the AMD GPUs
are lagging a little bit behind at 1080p
but I have to say they do come alive at
1440p and 4k and here they were very
competitive
speaking of 4k did you see the GTX 970
going toe-to-toe with the r9 390
spitting out 37 FPS on average I don't
recall exactly what time it was meant to
be but wasn't the 970 with its measly
three and a half gigabyte frame buffer
meant to be completely obsolete by now
and well pretty much just a heap of
rubbish maybe I got my dates mixed up
anyway the extremely popular Maxwell
based GPU is still trucking along just
fine as far as where you can tell
of course so too is the r9 390 and it's
never die attitude further down the food
chain though the r9 380 is quite simply
having its way with the gtx 960 though
it does go the other way when looking at
the gtx 950 and r7 370 is in video quite
easily wins that battle then at the
complete opposite end of the spectrum we
have the gtx 980ti
and once again it proved to be just far
too much for the fury x as for the
current generation GPUs if you're lucky
enough to own a gtx 1060 or rx 580 then
you look set to take full advantage of
what destiny 2 has to offer for the
single-player portion of the game as
long as you have a CPU that's better
than saying FX series are an old core i3
for example then you're going to be
right all of the rise and CPUs do very
well in this title as to intel's newer
dual-core CPUs supporting hyper
threading so the pentium g 4560 for
example through my brief testing I did
notice that the newer core i3 will see
utilization hovering around say 80% and
this is also true for the Pentium G 4560
meanwhile the rise in through 1200 was
more like 60 to 70% and the horizon 5
1400 was really only loaded up to say
about 50% then when it comes to memory
we were only seeing around 2.3 gigabytes
of vram allocated at 1440p and this
explains why the three gigabyte gtx 1060
does so well along with the gtx 970 even
at 4k we're only starting to get to the
limits of the three gigabyte buffer but
of course these GPUs run out of
processing power before the memory
capacity becomes an issue as for the
system memory or Ram it looks like 8
gigabytes will have you covered destiny
2 sucks up around 5 to 6 gigabytes at
least it did for this beta version
overall I found destiny 2 to be a very
fun and great looking game that appears
very well optimized for the PC I'm now
keener than ever to get my hands on the
full retail version not only to enjoy it
and play it but also for some more
in-depth benchmarks of course hopefully
though these benchmark results of the
beta version give you a good idea of how
your PC will perform in this upcoming
tile
speaking of which if your PC is in the
an upgrade to play destiny - then
perhaps you should check out and you
upgrade my PC please series I'll provide
a link in the video description below
that's it for this one guys
I'm your host Steve see again soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
