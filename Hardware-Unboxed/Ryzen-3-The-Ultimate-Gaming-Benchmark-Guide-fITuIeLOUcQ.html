we're doing more benchmarking and well
this one is quite interesting a few days
ago I compared some high-end more
expensive eight core CPUs but the week
prior to that we did receive the
affordable 4 quart rising 3 CPUs so I've
shifted gears yet again back to those
affordable C fuses there was quite a bit
more testing now I wanted to do speaking
of which this will be sort of just a
part 1 of what will be at least a three
part benchmark series but I'll talk
about that a bit later on in the video
for this video which I have boldly
titles arising through the ultimate
gaming benchmark guide will follow the
same format as my Pentium G 4560 the
ultimate gaming benchmark guide I
published that video back in January of
this year and at the time Hardware
unboxed it had about 45,000 subscribers
but the video did well and now has over
180,000 views over 4000 likes and less
than a hundred disease so whoo needless
to say a lot of you really enjoyed that
format and that's the reason why I've
decided to do it again for those of you
that didn't see the pentium g 4560 video
the idea here is to test CPU game and
performance with a number of different
tiered GPUs so for this video we'll be
benchmarking the rise in three CPUs long
so few competing processors from Intel
using the geforce gtx 1060 gtx 1070 and
gtx 10a all at 1080p although I am only
testing a single resolution the fact
that we have three very different
performing GPUs will give you an idea of
how things scale at various resolutions
it'll also give those sensible folks
pairing a budget CPU with a budget GPU a
real idea of what to expect meanwhile by
including the gtx 1080 you can see what
kind of performance a faster GPU might
enable should you have the CPU power to
take advantage of it
please note due to the limited pixel
real estate i've been restricted to the
number of CPUs that i can really compare
in a single graph before it just becomes
an incomprehensible mess so while I have
included a good range of processes I'm
sure there'll be an additional processor
or two that you would
like to see it included but as I said
there will be a few follow-up videos so
these aren't the only cps I'll be
testing in this way they're just the
only ones I've tested so far anyway
let's check out the results and then
I'll discuss a few more things at the
end of the video to the benchmarks
alright so first up we have battlefield
1 and as you can see there's a bit going
on here the blue bars represent the
Intel processors and we have the core i5
7400 and pentium g 4560 here meanwhile
the red bars represent the AMD
processors which includes the arisin v
1400 Rison 3 1300 x + r3 1200 as you can
see 5 cpus were tested three times in
battlefield one using the geforce gtx
1060 gtx 970 and GT x 1080 looking at
the gtx 1060 results first we see no
variance whatsoever between the cpus
tested the g 4560 provided the same
numbers as the i5 7400 as did all the
AMD cpus moving to the more powerful gtx
1070 graphics card and things start to
change a little now we know based on
previous testing with high-end CPUs that
the 1070 is on average 35% faster than
the 1060 as it packs 50% more cos using
the pentium g 45 60 we see that the
minimum frame rate is improved by just
11% for what looks like a very obvious
CPU bottleneck illustrating this point
further is the fact that the core i5
7400 boosts the performance by 31% with
the 1070 the r5 1400 also allowed very
nice 28% bump in the minimum frame rate
and now remember it is possible to
overclock the rise in cpus but through
what will no doubt be the dismay of many
i'm going to save the overclocking of
the rising cpus and feature them in a
different video for this one i just want
to establish a baseline performance
let's go with that there wasn't he
protecting just to get as far as we have
for this video basically 30 benchmark
runs per game as we're taking a three
run average nine games tested in total
so around 270 benchmark runs just for
this video that being said the Rison 3
1200 and 1300 x give us a good idea of
how well these CPUs will respond to
overclocking given it a 1300 X is
already 5% faster with
gtx 1070 when compared to the g 4560 the
r3 1200 did allow for an 8% increase in
the minimum frame rate once we move to
the gtx tonight it becomes quite clear
that none of these cpus are capable of
extracting anywhere near the maximum
performance from this GPU in a game that
relies heavily on cpu performance the i5
7400 and r5 1400 only saw a boost to the
minimum frame rate of 4% when compared
to the 1070 results interestingly the
Rison 3 cpus do a little better at
around a 7% increase but given the gtx
1080 is around 30% faster than the 1070
it's fair to say we're nowhere near
extracting maximum performance here f1
2016 is very heavy on the cpu and we see
this even when testing the gtx 1060 is
the lower end or lower o'clock cpus drop
off the pace ever so slightly the margin
certainly aren't noteworthy but when
compared to battlefield 1 there is a
distinct difference here jumping to the
gtx 1070 boosted the average frame rate
for all 5 configurations quite
substantially though it was a different
case for the minimum frame rate and this
is where we will focus our attention
here the pentium g 45 60 saw no
improvement at all while the horizon 3
1200 did see a noteworthy 21%
performance boost thanks to the superior
clock speeds the 1300 X also outpaced
the SMT enabled R 5 1400 still it was
the Intel cable a Chi 5 7400 that
provided the best results out of the box
with a minimum of 77 fps
moving to the GTX 1080 we see little to
no performance improvement with the
faster graphics card using these low-end
to mid-range CPUs moving a Far Cry
primal which is typically a GPU bound
game we find some interesting results
I say typically GPU bound because we
typically test with high-end CPUs the
challenge the CPU faces in this game is
the fact that it really only taxes a
single thread anyway using the gtx 1060
performance is much of a muchness
regardless of the cpu used it's a
similar story with the gtx 1070 well
almost
for whatever reason intel's high clock
kb lake cpus dominate this title and
here we see the core i5 7400 pulling
well ahead from the pack when looking at
the minimum frame rate
that said though this was the end of the
road for the i-5 17400 installing the
faster GTX 1080 basically produced the
exact same results
total war Warhammer is a very CPU
demanding game and can make good use of
multiple threads right away even with
the gtx 1060 we can set the g 45 60 is
getting a little left behind the plucky
little pentium processor is still able
to provide playable performance though
the rise in CPUs were noticeably better
despite that increasing the rendering
power with the gtx 1070 did a little to
improve the frame rates the i5 7400 did
see a nice 15% boost though even if it
isn't getting the most out of the gtx
1070 that being the case they moved to
the gtx 1080 made a little to no
difference and we were faced with an
extreme Seaview bottleneck 4 or 5
configurations next up we have overwatch
another game that can put many threads
to work surprisingly all 5 CPU
configurations were able to max out the
gtx 1060 which obviously includes the
dual-core HTN Abel G 4560 moving to the
gtx 1070 changes things quite a bit and
now we see the g 4560 falling well
behind and it's now only able to improve
over the 1060 results by a 10% margin
meanwhile the Rison 3 1200 enjoyed a 27%
performance increase and a 34% increase
for the r3 1300 ex in fact the 1300 ex
was comparable to the i5 7400 here while
the r5 1400 pushed a little further
ahead upgrading the GTX 1080 does little
to improve performance here though we
are seeing better gains here than
compared to most of the games we've
looked at so far the r5 1400 minimum
frame rate was boosted by 12% though
just 9% for the r3 1300 ex still though
the g40 560 created an even more extreme
bottleneck and only boosted performance
by 4% moving on to a very popular game
we have The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt and here
we see the gtx 1060 completely
neutralizes the playing field all CPUs
were limited to a minimum of 45 FPS as
this is what the GTX 1060 dips down to
in this title at 1080 P using said
quality settings and no amount of CPU
power can change that even with the gtx
1070 handling the rendering work the cpu
results are mostly this
with the exception of the G 4560 which
starts to drop off the pace a bit once
we install the 1080 performance does
start to differ between the various CPU
models the i5 7400 was king here though
the r5 1400 and r3 1300 X won't fire off
the pace and will no doubt still the
show once overclocked due to popular
demand I'm bringing back Rainbow six
siege and I'm glad I have as it provides
some interesting results here we see
even with the gtx 1060 installed the
horizon cpus are clearly faster than the
Intel processors been looking at the
all-important minimum frame rate moving
to the gtx 1070 the Rison cpus remain
strong though it has to be said the g 45
60 is hanging in there quite well also
from this point forward though we are
pretty much limited by the CPU moving to
the GTX 1080 didn't do much for us
especially when using the G 45 60 and r3
1200 moving on to World of Tanks this is
a game that doesn't really hammer the
CPU in the same way that total war
Warhammer or battlefield 1 does for
example CPU utilization is quite poor
and multi-core CPUs aren't really
properly utilized that said though as
the title isn't really that demanding on
the CPU you'll find that CPU such as the
Pentium G 45 60 do quite well that said
the dual core Intel CPU is clearly
peaking with the gtx 1060 perhaps doing
so with a minimum frame rate of well
over 130 fps it's a similar story with
the r3 1200 though it was a little
slower at around 120 fps but again at
these frame rates in this titles it's
kind of a negligible difference so
basically the difference in performance
when these CPUs really isn't important
as they all push over 120 fps for the
most part I guess the point here being
that for 1080p performance you need
nothing more than a gtx 1060 for this
title and finally we have Counter Strike
global Offensive and like World of Tanks
it really is all about the CPU here for
those high frame rates competitive
gamers crave to reduce things like input
lag for maximum responsiveness that said
though it still doesn't take advantage
of modern multi-core CPUs so again the G
45 60 is able to keep pace with the r3
1200 something it can't do in the more
modern titles the i5 7400 is again king
in these situations where we're relying
on a single core that said the rise in
three 1,300
it's never that far behind and with a
little overclocking should be able to
match or possibly even beat the core i5
processor basically those csgo gamers
need to worry less about their GPU in
place pretty much all of their attention
on the cpu alright so we've just seen
how these five CPUs comparing nine
different games is in the geforce gtx
960 gtx 970 and gtx 1080
the spreader games used were quite
different and in my opinion cover all
scenarios the results are interesting
and they tell us a number of things
starting with the demanding modern
titles such as battlefield one f1 2016
total war Warhammer The Witcher 3
overwatch an even Far Cry primal what we
found was the despite being modern and
very much able to take advantage of
high-end hardware they're also not
pushing entry-level hardware to the
point of becoming obsolete so I guess
it's kind of a happy medium then even
with a mid-range GPU such as the GTX
1060 we found little difference between
the Pentium G 4560 and Core i5 7400 and
the same was true for the horizon v 1400
which is another quad core but that
particular model has support for eight
threads thanks to SMT I also keep in
mind the gtx 1060 it's not exactly slow
either it's basically on par with the
mighty gtx 980 from the previous
generation so if you gave me with a
graphics card equivalent to say the
geforce gtx 1060 or something slower and
you plan on playing newly-released
titles then the rising three CPUs will
really be as good as any now what we've
seen here is once you upgrade your GPU
in the future or games become more
demanding Rison 3 will remain relevant
and within reason gamers won't need to
upgrade that CPU we of course saw this
when moving from the gtx 1060 to the gtx
1070 whereas with the g45 60 for example
we often saw little to no performance
gains when going with the faster gtx
1070 whereas we did see again with Rison
3 again as i touched on earlier you can
of course overclock the rise and three
cpus for even greater performance but
this is something i'll look at in a
future video for those playing older but
still very popular titles such as well
tanks or counter-strike for example
things do get a little more tricky while
also becoming more simplified at the
same time kind of odd I know the tricky
bit being which CPU is the best choice
for these types of games the type of
game that really only utilizes a single
thread the core i5 was clearly the
superior choice here but as a little bit
of a spoiler I can tell you that
overclocking Rison 3 does allow the red
team to take the lead over the i-5 7400
that said if you're after as many frames
as possible in this competitive shooter
then getting an unlocked Intel quad core
and overclocking a snot out of it is the
best way to go still if spending as
little money as possible is the aim then
Rison 3 is a much cheaper alternative
and really a much better cpu for all
occasions at least when compared to the
locked eye 5 7400 then we have the more
modern competitive shooters such as
Rainbow six siege and of course
overwatch here Aizen 3 pretty well match
the i5 7400 before any overclocking even
took place and when compared to the G 45
60 it was clearly the superior CPU at
least when looking at the overwatch
results with the gtx 1070 jumping back
to the modern more well-built titles
such as battlefield 1 we see that no
matter which cpu you choose Rison 3 or
the locked i-5 neither have enough in
the tank to utilize a graphics card
packing a GPU with more rendering power
than say the gtx 1070 at least under
these conditions as resolutions are
increased further load will be placed
more on the GPU and the CPU will likely
become less of a concern even so though
we know for a fact that no matter how
many pixels your GPU can spit out it
isn't going to render more than around
110 fps in battlefield 1 with a stock
horizon 3 CPU likewise in a game such as
csgo you aren't going to break that 300
FPS barrier without a little bit of
tinkering in the BIOS still just
focusing on the out-of-the-box
performance scene in this video it's
pretty clear that for the vast majority
of PC gamers horizon is going to be an
ideal solution and we'll see them well
off into the future as a side note I
know there will be those of you who will
say I wish you'd test it with more
realistic GPU such as the gtx 750ti
1050 or perhaps even the GT 1030 but the
fact of the matter is I didn't
need to the data would have told us
nothing we don't already know and it
would have shown yeah nothing different
than what we saw with the GTX 1060 the
frame rates would have of course been
lower but all the CPUs would have
produced the same lower frame rate
anyway next up I'll be looking at how
the horizon 3 1200 and risin 5 1400
compare and overclocked to 4 gigahertz
and then after that I'll check out Rison
3 against the overclocked core i5 2500 k
+ FX 83-70 it's kind of an upgrade as
guide those comparisons of course will
follow the same format as you've seen
here so the same nine games will be
tested with the same three GPUs I don't
know about you guys but I'm very keen to
see the results until then take it easy
I'm your host Steve I'll see you again
