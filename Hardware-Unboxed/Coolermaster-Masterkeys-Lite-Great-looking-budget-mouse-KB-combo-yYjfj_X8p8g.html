today I'm checking out a budget keyboard
and mouse combo from Coulomb a so called
the master keys light a product they've
label is having mem chemical switches
this is a word I've never seen before so
I was immediately intrigued as to what
it could mean when I popped it open in
my unboxing box the series before we
investigate that though let's check out
how it looks I've got to say that for a
budget combo both pieces look pretty
good the keyboards very simple with nice
vibrant backlighting that's quite
different to what you see in the
standard mechanical keyboard rather than
illuminate each switch the white plastic
backplate is fully lit up for really
even and bright effect we've got the
full RGB rainbow to play with here and
you can quickly toggle through some
different effects by using the function
key in the F key is across the top of
the keyboard here you can also adjust
the repeat rate to behind the home set
of keys you also get a set of media
functions to play with which is a good
inclusion to the mouse is pretty nice
looking it's a really standard shape
that fits in the hand nicely and again
the RGB lighting is used effectively
lighting up the scroll wheel and a Tron
life backlight both are black all around
quite lightweight wise and roll plastic
let's take a look at these mem chemical
switches now it turns out that the
switches themselves are a hundred
percent membrane as it expected this
price however coolermaster have made
them compatible with cherry MX key caps
so that's pretty much the end of that
story the mouse features nice and clicky
left and right buttons plus two back and
forward buttons on the left side of the
mouse making it much more suited to
right-handed users the surface is all
plastic with no rubber grips or texture
on either side underneath there's an
infrared a Vargo 3050 sensor as well as
three Mouse feet for smooth gliding I
found the sensor work just fine and it
worked alright on surfaces like cloth
and my desk too I found the mouse fine
to use although it can't compare in
terms of few to higher-end products from
my onyx steel series and Logitech for
example it just kind of feels a little
flimsy I'm very used to using very
high-end products though so switching to
this probably makes it more noticeable
to me it wasn't as noticeable as this
switch to the master keys light keyboard
however here's a sound
you guys to here I'm sure you can agree
it doesn't really sound good and
unfortunately it doesn't feel that good
either but hey it's a membrane keyboard
and I honestly don't think I've used one
in years
they just feel mushy and stiff as you'd
expect and they make a really hollow
ringing noise when they pop back up it's
not really pleasant it's also
surprisingly loud the spacebar was
probably the worst though as you heard
in the sound test it's extremely
rattling there's no software
accompanying this mouse and keyboard
combo all the functions you need to play
around whether on the keyboards F keys
and you can toggle through dpi levels by
pressing the little button behind the
scroll wheel on the mouse I feel like
now I need to mention the price to put
all this in perspective in the USA you
can grab this combo for just $60 and in
Australia you can get it for 80 for this
money it's a very good-looking set of
peripherals but you can get achieved 10
keyless mechanical keyboard for around
40 dollars now and then there's plenty
of cheap gaming mice you could add I can
see this master keys like combo being a
really good Christmas or birthday
present for a young gamer especially
who's just starting to get into PC
gaming and would love to have a keyboard
and mouse that look this cool for
experienced gamers with slightly bigger
budgets though probably isn't gonna cut
the mustard what do you guys think do
you know have a better budget combo
