going to be talking about a new set of
announcements from AMD at their next
horizon event in San Francisco as
expected the event was well it was
mostly focused on enterprise data center
and server products which we don't
normally cover on Hardware unboxed but
AMD did spend some time talking about
seven animated trips including epic Rome
and seven nanometer Vegas will be going
through all that stuff we'll also talk a
little bit at the end of the video on
how some of these new technologies
particularly Xen 2 might translate into
consumer desktop products in 2019
but first today's video has been
sponsored by asrock and their new
phantom gaming range of Z 390
motherboards these are 390 phantom of
gaming 6 and 9 include a blazing fast
2.5 gigabytes per second network
interface offering gamers and content
creators 2.5 times the bandwidth
compared to the standard Gigabit
Ethernet for more information please
check the link in the video description
we'll start with second-generation epic
CPUs codenamed Rome and this n 2
architecture because the most
interesting announcements relate to
these CPUs of course epic is AMD so
processor line so the specific products
won't be of much interest to most of our
audience but AMD is doing some very
interesting things with Rome that we
might see come to third generation
rising in 2019 so the big update is a
shift in total core count from 32 cores
in existing epic processes to 64 cores
with Rome and that's been made possible
thanks to the use of TSM cs7 animated
manufacturing process which is
delivering a two times improvement to
transistor density compared to the older
14 animator node but the cool thing
about Rome isn't the fact that the CPU
cores are manufactured on seven
animators but a new IO die design with
CPU core chip le'ts which separates most
Iowa functionality and the CPU cores
into their own separate dies as this
diagram shows n 2 epic processors will
have a 14 nanometer IO die in the center
of the chip that houses the memory
controllers in this case 8 of them along
with infinity fabric interconnects that
are attached to the CPU triplets there's
perhaps a few other things in there
Ayodhya as well but MB has indeed held
them
yet the chip 'lets themselves are built
using seven nanometers and each triplet
contains eight Xen two CPU cores along
with the set of PCIe lanes so while the
memory controllers are in the iodine
PCIe remains attached directly to the
CPU cores the key advantage to the i/o
diet is that each CPU chip late' will
have equal access to memory the current
configuration for epoch sees each CPU
die get its own memory controller so if
one core needs memory that's attached to
a different controller on a different
die there's a latency penalty to access
that memory compared to accessing memory
attached to its own diet with the i/o
die in next generation epoch that issue
should be eliminated and every die will
have equal access latency to the overall
memory pool of course we don't know at
this stage whether the i/o die increases
latency compared to a core accessing
memory from its own on-die controller in
the past epoch design but that's
something we'll figure out closer to
launch and AMD does state the overall
latency is improved with this new design
with this iodine design AMD can now
comfortably scale epic processes beyond
the four die configuration of past CPUs
so the top end epic roam chips will have
eight CPU triplet dies each with eight
Xen to cause for a total of 64 cores in
the top configuration and presumably
there will also be low tier chips we've
caused disabled the benefit of using
smaller 8 cores n2 dies on 7 nanometre
rather than say increasing the existing
design on a single die from 8 to 16
cores is a coarser yields and
manufacturing costs smaller chips are
easier and less costly to manufacture
and it allows for easier bidding and
this will help with first-generation
products on 7 nanometer as you can see
from some product shots of an epic roam
ship the eight Xen to triplets are
definitely very small compared to the
massive iodine in the center which
almost looks like a GPU in some ways
other epic room features include support
for 4 terabytes of DRAM per socket and a
total of 128 PCIe 4.0 lanes
yes PCIe 4.0 is supported with the new
epic processes all of this combined
allows anybody's new epic processors to
provide 2 times the performance per
socket and 4 times the floating-point
performance per socket though we'll get
into that in a moment
Kerli AMD isn't willing to
any cpu specifics like clock speeds or
power consumption at this stage but just
going from a 32 course to 64 cores per
socket is a massive 2x improvement which
is a big deal for data centers that love
processing density AMD also provided
some details on the Zen to architecture
and further information on what seven
nanometers allows them to do the big
news is that Zen 2 increases the width
of the floating point pipeline from 128
bits to 256 bits which should
drastically improve one of the key
weaknesses to am Lee's architecture and
that was AVX workloads this should bring
Zen 2 on par with Intel skylake
architecture in this regard which as we
know is basically the same architecture
used in today's 9th gen processors AMD
also improved a bunch of front-end stuff
including a better branch predictor
optimized instruction cashews a better
instruction prefetching and more all of
this strengthens their architecture to
provide better IPC although only didn't
specify any exact IP see improvement
figures the company also mentioned
they're working on Zen 4 which is no
great surprise while Zen 3 is on track
to use TSM C's 7 nanometre plus
manufacturing known on 7 nanometers aim
Lee says the new node allows them to
provide two times the transistor density
provide the same performance at half the
power or greater than 1.25 times the
performance at the same power AMD
mentioned this in both their CPU and GPU
presentations
speaking of GPUs AMD announced seven
nanometer Vega at the event today
although seven data meter Vega will be
restricted to server products in the
form of the Radeon Instinct mi 60 and mi
50 still there's a few interesting
things here as well
Vega 20 on 7 nanometre uses largely the
same GPU design as vega 10 on 14
nanometer in that it tops out at 64
compute units and it uses HBM to memory
however vega 20 improves
double-precision capabilities moving
from 1/16 rate to half rate which is big
news for compute applications there's
also support for into 8 and into 4 with
Vega 20 providing up to a hundred and
eighteen terror ops of inter for compute
performance Vega 20 includes a second
pair of HBM two controllers beefing up
memory support to 32 gigabytes
with increased clock speeds of 2
gigabits per second the
also getting PCIe 4.0 support and off
trip infinity fabric links for direct
connections to other cards despite all
of this the dive of ager 20 is smaller
than Vega 10 at 331 millimeters squared
compared to 484 millimeter squared all
thanks to seven nanometers and of course
Vega tween does have more transistors
inside in terms of performance well AMD
isn't going into specifics on clock
speed again but they did list fourteen
point seven teraflops of FP thirty-two
performance with 7 enemies providing
around at one point two five times gain
over fourteen animated in performance at
the same power consumption the mi-25 had
twelve point three teraflops of compute
so that's around a twenty percent jump
but for compute the real advantage is
the massive improvement to FP sixty-four
more memory and more memory bandwidth
and of course the other new features as
well as for product launches the mi
sixty will be shipping in q4 this year
with the mi 50 coming in q1 of next year
epoch room is currently sampling now and
will be launched at some point in 2019
although M didn't specify now let's head
down well I guess speculations straight
to talk about how some of these new
technologies might come across to
consumer desktop products because
there's a lot of things here that will
eventually make its way to AMD's next
gen CPUs and GPUs
however again what's coming up is just
pure speculation on our part we really
have no idea what AMD is doing on the
consumer side for certain as far as
third-generation Rison is concerned the
big takeaway here is what AMD is
officially stating seven nanometers can
provide compared to 14 nanometers
specifically they claim that they can
get greater than 1.25 times the
performance at the same power so first
generation was built using a 14
nanometer process and third gen will be
seven nanometers so presumably AMD will
be able to achieve much higher clock
speeds on seven enemies than 40
nanometers going on there 1.25 x perform
its claimed thousand seven 1,800 X
topped out at 4.0 gigahertz single core
with the 3.7 gigahertz or core so if we
did see clock speeds 1.25 times higher
than that for next gen rice and we'd be
looking at 4.6 gigahertz across eight
cores and up to five gigahertz on a
single core at the same power level as
the 1800 X again that is just
speculation but that follows on from
what AMD is saying factored in all the
other architecture improvements and we
potentially looking at a real beast for
third-gen risin the improved floating
point pipeline is particularly massive
news as this should bring third gen
rising in line with intel's current
processes for AVX workloads it's also
possible that AMD will use the ioad I
design which could allow them to put say
two eight cores n2 dies on the one am
for compatible chip the i/o dive looks
like it could easily be cut down into
quarters with one corner providing 2d
Ram controllers which will be well
suited to an am for CPU this would then
results in a 16 core CPU on the a m4
platform which would be an absolute
beast for productivity workloads without
needing to go to thread Ripper and again
going on AMD's numbers for seven
nanometers particularly stating that
they can achieve half the power
consumption at the same performance
theoretically AMD could use this aspect
of seven animators scaling capabilities
to double the core count of an a m4 chip
at the same power consumption level that
would mean something along the lines of
a 16 Courtship clocked up to 4.0
gigahertz with reasonable power
consumption that's very very exciting
and it would certainly be interesting to
see how Intel would respond as for GPUs
well it's a bit harder to tell how AMD's
next generation consumer GPUs will go
when vega 20 announced today does not
use AMD's upcoming na'vi architecture
that will be used for their consumer
gaming line so really we have no
insights into what na'vi will bring to
the table but again we are getting a
look at what seven animators might do on
the GPU side Vega 20 in the Radeon
Instinct mi 60 is about 20% faster than
Vega 10 in the instinct mi-25 for FP 32
work an AMD again says they should be
achieving upwards of 25 percent more
performance at the same power
consumption considering Nvidia czar TX
2080 Ti is in the region of 60% more
powerful than Vega 64 for gaming aim B
will need to do a lot of work on the
architecture front to get Navi up to the
ballpark of cheering it doesn't look
like seven animators alone will get them
there that said in terms of R or compute
performance the instinct mi 60 with 14.7
teraflops of FP 32 actually beats the RT
x 28 ET i with 13.4 teraflops so let's
hope na'vi can resolve some of the
architecture constraints that prevented
Vega from deliver
during all of that power for gaming
because if they can certainly unleash
all of that performance in
next-generation architecture and they'll
be really great news for gamers anyway
that's it for this brief look into what
AMD announced today at next horizon
we're expecting to hear more about seven
animated consumer products at CES 2019
so stay tuned for that in January I'd
