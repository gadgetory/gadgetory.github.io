experienced PC users claiming the
network attached storage device is a way
of a price they can build their own for
a lot less they're right about one thing
they can build their own for a lot less
and it might even end up being a great
deal more powerful
there's even products such as the
silverstone ds3 80 chassis you which are
designed for those willing to talk with
their own ass build a popular operating
system choices FreeNAS a free
open-source operating system based on
freebsd in the open ZFS file system so
why isn't everyone doing this I mean
they clearly aren't this company's such
a Synology and QNAP wouldn't have risen
to power there are now a dozen other
companies competing for their slice of
the network attached storage pie the
reason is the building configuring and
maintaining your own ass is a lot of
work it requires a great deal of
computer and networking knowledge on the
other hand my Synology ds1 five one five
was so easy to set up anyone with basic
PC experience would have found a breeze
this is what you're paying for a
well-thought-out and refined
installation process along with an
extremely easy to use yet very powerful
operating system still as an
ever-growing number of companies into
the NASA arena it's becoming
increasingly difficult to charge a
premium for the operating software
nakkeera now selling their readiness 102
for just $100 in diskless form an
incredible price for a tube a device
that said the readiness operating system
is severely lacking when compared to the
competition the same can be said for
buffalos I XEL d-link and TRENDnet
there is one emerging force in the NASA
market and surprisingly I'm yet to check
out any of their products despite using
their hard drives and all my devices
Western Digital has been developing NASA
products for quite a few years now into
the my cloud moniker looking at their
lineup I feel anyone will be
hard-pressed to build their own ass for
less even if you are good second-hand
shop up the my cloud 2 terabyte model
sells for just 135 dollars and includes
a 2 terabyte hard drive while the 4
terabyte model can be had for a little
under $200 even there my cloud business
models can be had for less than $500
with 4 terabytes worth of pre-configured
storage looking at past reviews it does
appear as though the my cloud series has
been battling with performance issues
and
functionality beyond basic NASA tasks
the cloudy XOR expert series was a step
in the right direction offering greater
performance and dis less options for
greater flexibility
earlier this year Western Digital
announced they are updating their
prosumer portfolio with the my cloud ext
ultra I'm through the faster dual-core
processor and more memory the FC ultra
would be superior in every way as was
the case of previous Western Digital NAS
devices the x2 ultra will be leveraging
the red family of hard drives which are
purpose-built for non-stop performance
in 24/7 NASA environments this new
series is available in sizes from disc
lists to 12 terabyte capacities the
Western Digital red drives are also
powered by Nass where 3.0 technology to
improve drive reliability and minimize
data corruption due to power loss or
disruptions at its heart you'll find a
marvel Armada 385 dual-core 1.3
gigahertz system-on-chip
which is a capable budget option that
can also be found in the Synology
DiskStation ds2 1:6 however
where's the DSP 1:6 is armed with just
512 megabytes of RAM the ESU ultra gets
a beefier 1 gigabyte memory capacity the
x2 ultra features no front panel
connectivities those wanting to connect
external storage life to do so from the
back where you'll find just 2 USB 3
ports and a gigabit network connection
needless to say the x2 ultra is
extremely light on connectivity
internally the drives amount of
vertically drawing air in through the
bottom and dissipating through the top
panel the natural drive air is aided by
a small fan and under load it does make
quite a bit of noise on top of the unit
built into the ventilator panel as a
thumb-sized indentation which looks a
bit like a power button you might find
on a pc case the irony being the x2
ultra doesn't actually have a power
button this button releases a catch
which allows the top panel to open on a
hinge model I have for review which is a
pair of 2 terabyte red drives which are
pre-installed and configured this meant
once all the necessary cables were
connected the unit powered on and after
around 30 seconds could be detected on
the network
it was then simply a matter of
double-clicking on the my cloud x2 ultra
which would launch the default web
browser and direct you to the my cloud
OS I really didn't know what to expect
when jumping into the my cloud operating
system so many of these cheaper Ness
alternatives are plagued by horrible
software still
this is Western Digital so I was hoping
for something half polished what I found
was a very basic operating system that
supported a few apps to make it a little
less bland the user interface is well
laid out and despite looking very boring
it functions quite well I certainly
wouldn't describe it as powerful the
basic stuff like creating users and
shared folders was quick and easy to
access and provided all the necessary
options the cloud access feature which
enables a smartphone or tablet to access
the NASS worked well and was easy to
configure to the default apps are
extremely basic and only included a
download of the PAPR ftp and HTTP
connections as well as a rudimentary web
file viewer there are around a dozen
other apps that can be downloaded and
installed the most noteworthy which
include plex media server WordPress PHP
BB and drop-offs finally you'll find a
general settings menu which allows for
alterations to be made to the network
settings and media settings along with a
few other typical options such as Drive
hibernation here are a few quick file
transfer tests uploading a large file
saw the my cloud x2 ultra maps out the
network connection at around 110
megabytes per second I should point out
the download performance was exactly the
same as if you give it internet
connection again causing a throughput
bottleneck when moving thousands of
smaller mixed files to and from the my
cloud x2 ultra we saw an average of 40
megabytes per second which is
respectable some of the fastest for bein
ass devices only averaged around 50 to
60 megabytes per second uploading the
Just Cause 3 game files which weighed in
at 50 1.1 gigabytes to 507 seconds which
meant the my cloud x2 ultra sustained
100 megabytes per second in this test
over the almost nine minutes it took to
complete value for money the Western
Digital my cloud x2 ultra is both good
and bad
well maybe not bad but not good
depending on your requirements let me
try and explain before you requires an
affordable Nass device with basic
functionality and decent performance
then the ext ultra looks very promising
for $350 the 4 terabyte model will cost
one hundred ninety dollars more than the
displace version so we slightly cheaper
to buy the drive separately though it
might not be worth it as the
pre-configured versions come back by
3-year warranty
while the disclose model only comes with
a two-year warranty of course Western
Digital offers a three year warranty and
all of their
drives that doesn't do you much good if
the HP ultra cell fails out of
warranties as good as the right series
drives are they always seem to be
overkill what's essentially a budget 106
villain asks the Itachi death star
7k to terabyte drives $50 each might be
a better pairing for example the total
cost would come to just $260 a 26%
saving still though seeking an
out-of-the-box solution the
pre-configured
x2 ultras are hard to go by the Synology
ds2 1/6 that I mentioned earlier in the
review features similar hardware but
enjoys a vastly superior operating
system still all those extra software
features come at a price as the ds2 1/6
costs 270 dollars in disclose form as we
just pointed out it is possible to
configure the x2 ultra with 4 terabytes
of storage for less for around the same
money the ds2 1/6 SC can be had the
marble I'm outta 370 dual-core 800
megahertz processor is painfully slow
this lack of horsepower makes many of
Synology awesome software features
unusable
so although Western Digital does have a
long way to go if they wish to match the
capability of devices from Synology and
QNAP they can safely rely on competitive
pricing to keep them in the game for now
as much as I enjoy the convenience of
the pre-configured 4 terabyte model I
think the disillusion with a pair of
budget drives might be a smarter choice
for this product in a nutshell the my
cloud ext ultra is plenty fast for home
users it's easy to set up and use and
the quality of the software is good just
by being fairly basic and paying for
your buck there really isn't anything
better thanks for joining me for another
product review
I'm your host is always matt and i look
forward to seeing you guys next time
