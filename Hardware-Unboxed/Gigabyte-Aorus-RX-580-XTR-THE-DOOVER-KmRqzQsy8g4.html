checking out gigabytes most extreme
Radeon rx 580 graphics card and as such
it obviously falls under the Auris
branding the RX 5/8 extr
otherwise known as extreme and that's
extreme with an ex not an e is basically
gigabyte making amends for messing up
with the RX 480
so some inexplicable reason gigabyte
managed to produce one of the worst are
X 480 series going around the g1 gaming
model for example hit load temperatures
of a degrees and it wasn't particularly
quiet about it either meanwhile
competing models were running around 10
degrees cooler while managing to
generate less noise I couldn't really
work out what was going on there
I mean the cooler looked decent enough
maybe the heat pipes were fake I don't
know anyway all that doesn't matter
anymore gigabyte have pulled their
finger out and completely revamp things
for the new rx 500 series recently I
featured the Auris rx5 ATX tear in my
GTX 1060 vs. rx 580 comparison obviously
it was used to represent the red team
and it did an excellent job managing to
edge out the GTX 10 69 gigabits per
second version by a small margin haven't
been very impressed with the Auris brand
card over the past 4 weeks or so I
thought it was about time I gave it a
proper review naturally my timing
couldn't have been any worse as right
now it's nearly impossible to purchase
an RX 500 series graphics card let alone
a premium rx 580 model the reason for
this is of course GPU based
cryptocurrency mining namely aetherium
right now aetherium is blowing up and
everyone wants a piece of the action
and since AMD hardware is much more
efficient when it comes to mining the
radio and GPUs are currently a seriously
hot item and I mean that in a good way
so I get the timing of this review isn't
great but surely before too long you
will be able to not just buy an Rx for
80 graphics card but do so at a
reasonable price the MSRP is of course
$230 us for the 8 gigabyte model right
so down to business the 5/8 extr is a
big beefy graphics card especially for a
mid-range product for
it will take up three slots so be aware
of that it is quite thick and it's also
quite long at two hundred and seventy
five millimeters weight wise it's
nothing too extreme it's certainly not
going to cause any problems there
nothing like the gtx 1080i cards i've
looked at recently in total it weighs
about 970 grams of that weight 647 grams
can be accounted for by the massive
cooler the cooler does they look quite
impressive in my opinion and although
there are still a few orange highlights
they are very subtle the black plastic
fan shroud looks very aggressive and
while it won't appeal to all nothing
ever does I have to say I quite like it
the X in the center where you might
expect a third fan also looks very cool
speaking of fans the huge heatsink
beneath is cooled via a pair of 100
millimeter fans which spin in alternate
directions to reduce air turbulence and
therefore operating noise gigabyte also
claims this boosts heat dissipation as
we've come to expect the fans will shut
down completely when the card is a title
and they also feature gigabytes unique
fan blade design on the backside of the
graphics card we find a smart looking
backplate again a few subtle orange
highlights here and there and of course
that cute little copper insert that
doesn't do much other than look cute I
mean tough of course removing the cooler
gives us a closer look at not just at
ECB but also the cooler itself gigabytes
gone with direct touch pipes to enhance
the thermal transfer they also save a
little on the weight and cost by going
with this method opposed using a thick
copper insert there's also a small
aluminium heat spray attached to the
base that cools the gddr5 memory and
then there's a separate bank of
aluminium fins to cool the vrm in total
there are three series of aluminium fins
covering the entire length of the card I
may are connected using four copper heat
pipes one of which is an eight
millimeter pipe while the other three
are six millimeter pipes moving over to
the naked PCB we find a six plus one
phase vrm which typically should be
enough for a decent overclock though
them offsets used here aren't the best
so it will be interesting to see how far
the card goes feeding in power is an
8-pin plus a 6 pin PCI power connector
moving around to the i/o into the car we
find a dual link DVI output HDMI 2.0
output and
three DisplayPort 1.4 outputs finally
out of the box the card comes clocked at
a boost frequency of 1425 megahertz
which is a decent six percent factory
overclock over the 13 hundred and 40
megahertz spec using the Auris graphics
engine software you can boost the
frequency to 1439 megahertz at the click
of a button and I'm keen to see how much
further the card will go through custom
overclocking in order to find out let's
jump to the benchmarks please note for
testing the latest display drivers were
used on our core i7 77 okay test system
clocked at 4.9 gigahertz starting off
with Dawn of War three we find very
competitive performance between the RX
580 rx 480 and GTX 1060 graphics cards
the or SRX 580 XG l was the fastest of
the lot by a whisker demonstrating very
strong performance at 1080p upping the
resolution or 1440p plays further into
the hands of the AMD graphics cards and
now the RX 580 has a decent performance
advantage over the 10 60s when comparing
the minimum frame rate the RS rx 5/8
extr also performed very well and rise
of the Tomb Raider basically matching
the msi gtx 1060 gaming X plus 6 G for
the top spot with an average of 67 FPS
at an EP the 5/8 extr was also 2 FPS
faster than the Nitro+ though they did
both deliver the same minimum of 49 fps
jumping to 1440p reduced the average
frame rate to 46 fps and this was the
same result spat out by the MSI gaming
x+ ideally gamers will want to reduce
the quality settings ever so slightly to
reach 60 FPS the green team enjoys a
slight performance advantage in Tom
Clancy's Ghost Recon wildlands that said
it is only very slight and in fact the
RS rx 580 XJ is able to match the
minimum frame rate of the MSI GTX 1060
gaming x6g meanwhile it was the fastest
a media graphics card tested at 1080p
moving the 1440p the 580 XG r is able to
close in on the GTX 10 60s and match
them with a minimum of 37 fps an average
of 47 fps again those targeting 60 fps
will want to reduce the quality settings
ever so slightly when it comes to power
consumption the Auris RX 5 ATX charge
hugs that juice like a footy jock on his
18th birthday alright it's not that bad
but still when compared to the GTX 1060
cards
we do see more than a 20 percent
increase in total system consumption
that said though as I noted in my
previous rx 580 vs. GTX 1060 video
consuming around 350 watts for the
entire system when gaming isn't that
extreme and a basic 450 to 500 watt
power supply will have you more than
covered still low power consumption is
well worth noting so consider it noted
anyway moving on to the temps
unsurprisingly that extra power
consumption translates into added heat
and here we see despite its massive
cooler the Auris are x58 extr does run
quite a bit hotter than the msi gtx 1060
models but said though peaking at just
71 degrees is a very impressive result
and this makes the Auris card 4 degrees
cooler than the Sapphire Nitro+ perhaps
more impressive is the fact that at this
temperature the card is virtually silent
honestly I never really have much luck
overclocking AMD graphics cards at least
in recent times I don't know if it's
something I'm doing I'm just unlucky
maybe I'm just missing something or it
could be because I properly vet my
overclocks
I've seen a few reviewers claiming here
around 1480 megahertz which seems
plausible and some uses the claiming 1.5
gigahertz and beyond which while
possible seems less likely anyway I
wasn't able to game for a short period
at 1480 megahertz
though it was rare I could go for more
than say 10 minutes without the game
crashing dropping down a 1470 megahertz
would see the crashes happen less
frequently but even so gaming past 10
minutes was still quite difficult to do
despite the fact that I was seeing very
low temperatures in the end it was the
1400 60 megahertz frequency that
delivered the goods here the system
remained 100% stable after more than an
hour of gaming the gddr5 memory also hit
2112 megahertz which is a mild six
percent overclock it was probably a bit
more Headroom here I was mostly focused
on getting the most out of the core in
the end I only managed to squeeze three
percent more out of the card hardly
seems worth it even if I got to 1.5
gigahertz that's a mere 4% overclock
over the cards IRA C mode and you'll
likely only see gains of around 2 to 3
senso not really worth making a big deal
about anyway at fourteen hundred and
sixty megahertz
I set the fan speed at sixty percent and
this meant you could just hear the card
over the case fans I certainly wouldn't
have called it loud or anything like
that
this made the operating temperature of
just fifty three degrees most impressive
and just goes to show how relaxed the
fan curve is on the auto profile well
that wraps up my gigabyte or s RX 5/8
extr 8g review overall a solid contender
from gigabyte out of the box performance
is excellent making this one of the
fastest rx 580 cards on the market right
now unfortunately as it stands I can't
really discuss pricing right now as
availability is practically non-existent
as a result prices are sky high I have
no idea how long it'll be before price
is correct we'll just have to see how
long this mining boom last before we can
get back to good old gaming I'd probably
have a go at the mining thing that power
in Australia costs a small fortune as it
is anyway once pricing correction you
can purchase the 580 XJR for a
reasonable price then I highly recommend
it as I said the AMD MSRP is set at $230
us for the 580 and that directly
translates to just over $300 Aussie
right now so ideally I wouldn't
recommend spending more than say $260
u.s. or $350 Australian on this graphics
card so just keep that in mind well
that's going to do it for this one I'm
your host Steve see you again soon guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
