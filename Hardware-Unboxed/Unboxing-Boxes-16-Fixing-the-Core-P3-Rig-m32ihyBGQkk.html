unboxing box's adventure for this
particular adventure we have just two
boxes on hand there is a heat more over
here in the pile to my right but we're
only gonna have time for two boxes today
as I mentioned in last week's episode
we're going to attempt to fix the
thermal take Corp III liquid cooled
build again there isn't any issue with
the liquid cooling part itself that
works amazingly well back when we finish
the build in August everything seemed
fine the system benchmarked well and was
perfectly stable about three weeks after
completing the build we had to review
the gtx 1070 game Rock premium edition
graphics card which palette sent over
with a liquid cooling block to test it
out we removed the GTX 1080 from the P 3
loop and installed the game rock card
this all went well and once the review
was completed we reinstalled the GTX
1080 draining the liquid refitting the
card and then pouring a liquid back in
or went smoothly basically everything on
the surface appeared fine however
something odd happened we could no
longer watch videos on the P 3 system
damn singer work okay though so we knew
the graphics card wasn't damaged and
that was I have to say a big relief last
thing you want to do is go kill a
founders edition GTX 1080
that wouldn't have gone over
particularly well but with the graphics
card confirmed as a okay we believe to
the next culprit would likely be the
drivers something some sort of software
glitch anyway we did a clean sweep I did
that in the safe mode got rid of all the
drivers started again and encountered
the same problem so the next logical
step was to believe and had something to
with the windows install I don't I don't
know what could have gone wrong between
you know we hadn't done anything from
the last time we used the system's now
but who knows we were running out of
ideas quickly we were overlooking the
obvious but I'll get to that shortly by
taking the SSD out of the core P 3
whacking it in one of our test systems
fired it up everything worked fine did
the reverse took the test system SSD out
put it in the core p3 and sure enough
videos without affecting in games had
simple stutter so clearly then it was a
problem with the hardware in the core p3
build either something with the
motherboard or what we eventually found
it to be by this point it was narrowed
down to a hardware issue and then I had
a light bulb moment I had heard of
issues with the thermal tight riser
cables and I think even some of you guys
warned us in the comments during the p3
build series as it turned out then we'll
take her to recently sent along some
spare cables they didn't really say why
it was more of a here have these cables
guys kind of situation carefully
installing one of the replacement cables
which is a serious pain and a hard pipe
liquid-cooled system I might add the
issue seemed to go away and the system
ran as expected however I wasn't
satisfied with that and I did a little
further investigating with these new
cables despite everything looking okay
on the surface at times I did known as
frame stuttering in games not something
you expect to see with the GeForce GTX
1080 core i7 69 50 X and 64 gigabytes of
ddr4 memory opening up a little
application called latency Mon
everything seemed okay at idle however
the second I played a YouTube video or
loaded a game the interrupts to process
latency went through the roof this meant
the system was having trouble handling
real-time audio and video amongst other
things a second riser cable was
installed with no kinks or bends and the
same issue with latency was found
bending the cable in anyway amplified
the issue massively and without too much
rough handling it was pretty easy to
damage the cable at the point where it
would no longer work sadly though to
some of you guys this will not be news
this has been an ongoing issue for quite
some time now when thermal takers even
owned up to it the problem being they
haven't really fixed it despite you know
replacing cables and saying they have
found the issues which it appears like
they haven't over on the thermal tape
forums you will find a number of
detailed threads from customers having
similar experiences and frustrations to
us the solution unfortunately is a
rather expensive one most attorney to a
shielded riser cable from 3m those that
have purchased this cable claimed that
it works perfectly and really it would
want - given the hideous price tag of a
hundred and twenty dollars US given
that's the retail price for thermal tech
scorpy three it's really not an ideal
solution finding a replacement cable in
Australia
isn't easy but in the end I picked up a
LeeAnn Lee PCIe x 16 cable that goes by
the model name PW PCIe 38 - 1 I picked
mine up from Al's PC market for a
hundred and eighteen dollars so let's
take a look at it install it in the core
P 3 rig and hopefully all my troubles go
away could it be that simple
alright plain-looking box it does have
what we want inside which is good or at
least it should it's advertised to have
what we need this is looking promising
indeed wow that's a much more impressive
looking cable I'll be title you have got
two screws to secure it if you don't
have two screws so that end obviously
goes in your motherboard graphics card
sits in there so in our rig it would
look something I actually way more way
way more cable than we need you want to
be careful not to bend them too
aggressive at the ends here may not be
too much of an issue for that cable do
me go so idea these two here I believe
these two are the replacement cables
kinda lost track of what's what at this
point I've put that many of these
looking cables into that system I think
it's 4 in total I've used but yeah these
are the cables that's it with the
shielding off as you can see it's just
two ribbon cables something that you'd
sort of would have seen on the old hard
drives or floppy drives or whatever like
that but not particularly impressive and
so the black stuff that you see on here
is the shielding if we peel it away here
you'll see how well you can see the foil
there I might have to do some b-roll but
that foil there is meant to be the
shielding as you can see at the ends
it's not doing a great job of covering
the cable and its entirety but anyway
the cables they they don't work full
stop let's just get that out of the way
make it clear that they do not work at
all I mean that even when they appear to
be working the latency through these
cables is still just horrible you might
get away with it with low end gear but
throw any high-end graphics cards on
this thing and you're gonna you know
know about it
to avoid the the bigger issues you
basically don't want to bender the cable
at all
which is impossible to do that's the
whole point of a flexible rise cable or
riser cable you know that end in our
build that end will go on your
motherboard you we to get it working
there to do like the most gentle
delicate Bend there and then this you
have to bend all the way around so you
want to sort of look like that it's
pretty difficult to do with that bending
it and yeah if you have a brand new
fresh cable and you do that really
delicate like it will appear to work
there'll be a tiny bit of stuttering
here and there but you know latency will
still be terrible and you'll eventually
notice more and more glitches and if you
do what we did on the second time we put
it in and do something like a bit of an
aggressive Bend like that it's going to
be horrible and not work at all which is
what I suspect most people have done
because that's just an easier cleaner
look but yet we pretty much destroys the
cable and once you bend these things
aggressively bending him back doesn't
solve the problem you've you've screwed
its cactus so we will install this one
in a moment and see if that our solves
our problems I'm hoping it will I've
heard reports that it does but anyway
we'll get to that shortly before we do
we've got one box here that we'll have a
look in and this has been sent from or
organized by gigabyte and it should be
the last piece of our $1,200 u.s. 1440p
build so thankfully I can finally put
that thing together hopefully later this
week maybe Thursday afternoon you'll see
that video pop-up where a little bit of
a time-lapse of putting the whole thing
together and then I'll bust out a 1440p
monitor in place and games on it and
record that so that should be really
cool looking forward to doing that have
been for weeks now and finally if this
has what I think it has which it does it
is the gigabyte gtx 1070 it's a a base
model windforce version so it comes in
at 380 dollars u.s. and at the moment i
think new eggs even throwing in a copy
of Gears of War 4 for a limited time so
that's a really cool deal for us all
these you're paying about $600 for this
car
is about as cheap as 10 70s get sounds
like a lot compared to the u.s. price
but that's just that's how the currency
conversion and taxes and all that work
yeah and in our x4 ad I think the
cheapest ones in Australia are about
$400 anyway so you're paying 200 bucks
more for or 1070 so both cards a good
value but you definitely get your extra
two hundred dollars worth out of this
sucker that's for sure
I'll have a have a quick look at it
since we're going to spend so much time
on the riser cables which I know is
thrilling but it's an interesting issue
or a frustrating one depending on
whether you bought one or not so what we
have here it's actually pretty it looks
similar to the g1 gaming no doubt the
cool is slightly smaller we're missing
one fan I'm sure there's been
modifications or rather down grades to
the power delivery you've got one 8-pin
connector which I believe is the same
situation on the g1 gaming version but I
mean it's going to be a capable card
anyway and you're certainly not losing
any performance or anything like that
like that compared to our founders
edition or whatever but yeah thrown in
$1.00 so it's as cheap as a 10-7 he gets
really and it will perform as you would
expect a 1072 which is all the reasons
why we've picked it for our 1440p build
and it should look right at home in that
build but anyway we'll you'll see more
of this card in probably Thursday's
video so stay tuned for that one all
right well I think I should probably go
and dig out the core p3 system and we'll
try and squeeze the cable into that and
see if we can get it installed right so
here is the beast it's looking a little
sad are the graphics cards meant to be
pop propped up rather a bit more like
that but we've had to take all the
mounting gear out to try and change the
riser cable I'm not sure how I'm gonna
get this really a big one in here
without having you know I want to avoid
draining the system disconnecting the
graphics card and basically starting
over from scratch because we've done
that too many times now but if I have to
our will but hopefully
we can sort of do this a bit dodgy and
wriggle it out so there's the cable that
was in there and that's that that was
that was probably working as as well as
any of them have and that's what I'm
talking about with the sort of more
gentle bend off there but while it was
possible to play games without too much
trouble and the videos and all that were
actually playing properly with this
cable in there with latency Mon open you
as soon as you loaded up a video you saw
the latency creep up and a game it just
shut off the scale and basically
informed you that this system would
probably have trouble with the real-time
audio and video so that's not something
you want to see on a system worth the
kind of money this thing is so four
hundred twenty bucks we bought this
which hopefully solves all those
problems and we can still have this nice
front mounted graphics card which looks
really cool and not have to redo all the
plumbing and mount it like it would be
vertically or horizontally anyway let's
try and put this 380 millimeter long
cable and Eve I'm not sure where we're
gonna tuck all the excess okay well we
got one in plugged in hmm I really don't
want to bend the hell out of this thing
the last thing I want to do so try and
find a way to tuck all this behind the
graphics card yeah it's a bit longer
this is not something you'd want to be
doing if you'd walked out what your
system is actually worth a retail
less-than-ideal the absolute last thing
you want to be doing is jiggling all
this around and try and squeeze in a
cable you'd be you'd be sweating on a
day that isn't 38 degrees let's just say
that but I mean that's connected up that
should be working now so I might give
that a quick go and if that's all
working I'll put all the necessary
mounting stuff back in stop the card
from drooping
and yeah then we should be should all be
good but I mean this not sure out looks
from the front but I mean that cables
not too bad it's a lot longer than you
need obviously but if it works you're
not really gonna care too much I pad for
the fatty pad under $20 for it and you
probably didn't budget for that but
anyway it's another story
I'll plug this in I'll probably do an
overlay of and some commentary of what I
found was that cable installed so with
the only cable and so latency issues
went away latency mon was no longer
reporting the system was having trouble
with real-time playback at this point I
haven't had a chance to use the core p3
extensively with this cable but so far
early indications look good so the real
question being can thermaltake solve
this issue honestly I don't think they
can from what I've seen all PCIe times
16 riser cables that are properly
shielded cost over hundred dollars
meanwhile Thermaltake charge is just $20
for their shielded cable really if it
costs somewhere around $100 to produce a
properly shielded cable then I think
it's fair to say fen we'll take her up
that famous creek without a paddle
there's no way customers can justify
spending 120 dollars on a p3 case only
then turn around and deal what we've
done and spend about 120 dollars on a
cable that makes the case unique it
takes advantage of that front-facing
graphics card without that it's not
nearly as an appealing product in my
opinion we genuinely do like Thermaltake
products such as the core p3 here at
harbor unboxed and the guys from the
local Thermaltake team here in melbourne
are really really good people still you
guys are our number one priority so at
this point we strongly recommend you
avoid using the thermal tech riser
cables which sadly as I just said Mac's
products such as the core p3 and port p5
a lot less appealing which is
disappointing that's a bit of a downer
to end on so on a brighter note later in
the week we will have the $1200 1440p
gaming build and benchmark video
and before I plan to do that I will have
an another interesting video and this
one looks at the best $200
ozzie graphics card and it might not be
the comparison you're expecting so make
sure you check that out if all goes to
plan that should be on the channel
tomorrow night on a final note do you
guys think we should rename the unboxing
series the point of this series was to
provide some light-hearted content but I
feel we could possibly be doing a bit
more with the series I still plan to
keep showing you products that we get in
I think that's a fun little insight but
I feel like we could be covering other
topics and issues on this segment and I
don't know if the unboxing boxes name
would be appropriate for that kind of
stuff so many ideas or suggestions are
welcomed generally the guys watching
these series are our most loyal viewers
so we are keen to hear from you guys
anyway that brings us to the end of this
video I hope you guys enjoyed it and
found the content interesting as always
yeah I'm gonna say as always now as
always I'm your host Steve and please
stay tuned because later this week we
have some very very interesting content
coming your way</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
