time for the final QA of the year
obviously our December QA and yeah I'm
already pretty much in holiday mode I
headed off to Tim's this morning
completely for that I actually had to
appear on the main channel for the QA I
thought we were just doing our live
streams and I just throw on any old
shirt and this is the shirt that
everyone hates because it does that
what's that effect called again I think
it's the Morrie effect why I don't know
anyway does some effect where I move
around it's all very weird
so everyone complains about that so I'm
already messing up whatever we have
plenty of good questions so hopefully
that will make up for me wearing the
wrong shirt okay first question are you
ready for the first question I'm ready
let's get into it we're ready when
should a power user upgrade hard drives
and SSDs if this space is not an issue
okay so how often does she change that
stuff 50 spaces and an issue how much
faster a new ones versus models from
three years ago so I assume we're
talking about newer SSDs there so unv
amazing that sort of stuff
also when is long term reliability of
those drives become a concern and
warrant an upgrade
okay that's a pretty good question I've
sort of wondered that myself actually
with SSDs join me to take that one or if
you get some IDs so go ahead
um well as for the hard drives it
depends on how much you're using em and
stuff like that but generally hard
drives are pretty reliable especially
when you're proven to be reliable up
until this point so I probably wouldn't
worry about hard drives too much as long
as you backup the data that's on them
then you know I just use hard drives
till they die SSDs it's a little bit
different because you can sort of get an
indication of when they're wearing so
Tim that you were saying to me earlier
that hardware info gives you that kind
of yeah I think hardware info gives you
the total amount that you've written
yeah the drive okay so then you can base
that against your the insurance rating
of the driver you have to sort of see
how far into its life okay I think
there's also maybe a percentage there
that it gives you as well of you know
how much life you've got left in
okay so yeah that tends to be a good way
to you know know when your SSD is going
to die but usually the endurance ratings
are so massive for a typical consumer
it's very difficult to get there so yeah
it's pretty difficult so I guess the
thing that I sort of think with SSDs is
that SATA drives so the more basic you
know cheaper end of the scale tend to be
fine in terms of performance for most
tasks sure initial like really have a
workload that's very storage intensive
especially with random you know access
yep you don't really mean and the speed
advantage of nvme drives so I tend to
think there's not a lot of reason to
upgrade a drive that's not capacity
related definitely for gamers and sort
of general usage absolutely you talked
about this in your thread refer video
saying that you've upgraded to a pretty
high performance nvme SSD yeah that's
just as a scratch yes yeah for premiere
now yeah that was you know obviously
premiere when you've got those 4k videos
is really hammering the drives at
certain times so that's why the
advantages to having that PCI you drive
in there but yeah again I think for
things like you know loading windows
which is one of the you know learning
apps like a silent drive is going to be
fine so there's not as much incentive to
say if you had a even know like an 860
Evo or something to go up to like a 970
Pro it's not for desktop users it's
definitely a luxury item far from a
necessity know you thought you say you
stand inside our SSD plenty fast enough
and you can just monitor the wear level
the endurance how much you've used at
this some pretty good standalone
applications as well I think I don't
know if this is its exact name but there
was one I used years ago that think was
called SSD life that was pretty good
that you just recommended Malware now
haven't you possibly possibly well if I
have rewind so manufacturers such as
Samsung they're obviously a popular
maker Vestas days they have life the
Samsung Magician which will give you a
fairly basic condition whether it's good
or whatever so that that's a pretty good
indication I think they will go into
some more detail there of like how many
how much data has been written and all
that sort of stuff and obviously the
controllers now manage them pretty well
so that they make sure that like one
sells not just hammered peeps they yeah
spread it out so yeah I mean I wouldn't
worry too much about it as long as you
backup your data then you just use it
till they die I wouldn't change it
prematurely yeah that's fair so okay
apparently this one from Derby the name
is suitable on this question massive
adobe success
cut that out don't cut that out
I'm from YouTube well it's on all of
them because this was heavily upload not
it was yeah so this was heavily upvote I
think people just like the controversy
or I don't know how it is I'll write the
question out do you think the new AMD
GPU leaks are too good to be true if
anyone has watched Tim's video on this
that comment is hilarious anyway the RX
30 ad will perform around our TX 2070
our TX 2080 for half the price okay can
we just cut the video here to enter or
insert you're a bit on this and this
move on oh I guess we could do that I
mean yeah it's surprising that some
people didn't see that video considering
what was the most I'm going one of the
most that voted YouTube yeah on our
community tab anyway but yeah I guess
all of our thoughts are in in that view
I mean yeah our tix are not actually
access it via rx 3080 performing around
our tix 2070 for half the price I could
see that happening if it was released
much later in the year around when
Nvidia releases their 7 nanometre procs
because then there'll be a lot of
competition but I can't see them
releasing mercy at CES or in the no
future when they're just competing with
new videos cards and you know I'd love
you to be wrong yeah cannibalizing their
rx 590 so later in the year definite
possibility but sooner than that can't
see it happening ok next question and
I'm gonna hand this one off to Tim so
we'll get this out of the way I wonder
you can see that minimum specs for a
second PC used only for streaming turnip
a 60 FPS on Twitch go for it um so I
think 1080p 60fps isn't particularly
interior thought so
I think if you already have a high-end
system like rise to 720 700 X or you
know high in Intel a 700 K you should be
able to play the game and stream on the
same PC reasonable quality if you're
after that second PC then you'll be sort
of looking at you sort of encoding
medium or slow next to 64 presets which
you might not be able to do on the same
PC in which case a lot of CPUs really
have the capability to do that I mean
something like a risin 5 2600 is going
to be fine for like medium 1080p 60
encoding certainly this PC we use for
streaming here for our live streams has
a 2700 X in it and so that's our high in
CP has used it like 30 percent 40
percent utilization when encoding 1080p
60fps using the medium preset so you
don't really need anything super
high-end interesting look into though
together yeah also wonder how many
people do have that set up of a second
stream PC because I would think that not
many a second PC for streaming is really
a sort of you're more into your
streaming you're sure more potentially
professional and in which case do you
make that second PC also an editing rig
for everything say highlight clips for
YouTube or something
in which case then you know a 2600 might
be fine for streaming yeah but you might
want something like even if the red
ripper 2950 x4 videos if this is ask on
their behalf of someone who is getting
into twitch and want to take it go
fairly seriously and I want frame drops
and things like that and stuttering then
yeah I think an older even as old as
maybe Sandy Bridge like yeah lock system
overclocked has well any of those sort
of older quad core systems probably
would work like I said I'm good to
actually do some proper benchmarking on
that and see yeah I imagine that would
be fine just for the encouraging part
yep all right next one is from Nick
discord server I've heard from several
sources now that the 2070 and 2080 are
not selling well and what do you guys
think the chances are of a rebate
bundled games or MSRP
a price drop to encourage those
important sales now
in their next quarterly financial report
um well we've also heard that they're
not selling well I haven't seen any
concrete evidence that's the case yes
they well the 2070 dropped down to the
MSRP for a lot of cards the base price
quite quickly so that somewhat suggests
that they're not selling like hotcakes
and the 2080 is now there though it did
take a little bit longer so read into
that what you will yeah I think the
thing I sort of see with the 27 to 28 is
that I imagined that they didn't sell
particularly well to begin with not just
for the reason of offering you know
similar price to the previous gen and
similar performance but also a lot of
people were just buying Pascal cards
like if you're really waiting until
Nvidia r-tx came out so that you could
see what it's like as we recommend at
the start you know at 1080 TI of 1080 at
1070 TI are all sort of better value
propositions but now that the 1080 and
1080i are pretty much gone from the
market the prices are inflated because
stock levels have dropped massively I
wouldn't be surprised to see those sales
pick up a bit because there's no other
competition if you if you're right now
wanting to buy a high end GPU your
options are RTX 2080 or at 6:28 TI and
then with the RT x 2070 it's competing
with Vegas 64 which is a similar price
it's around at $500 mark and depending
on the game now let's be honest even
before that it was still Pascal we were
mostly recommending so I'm still in
video basically don't address the
question I don't think there'll be any
rebates any I mean bundled game now and
go there's a battlefield fire fund the
MSRP will definitely not drop about I
shouldn't say definitely but I'm certain
it won't yeah until AMD pull their thumb
out and have a go pretty much
competition creates price drops
infatuation war GPU was say we need to
get them going again
alright now the popular question on
YouTube do you think game developers get
less creative like just rebranding their
old stuff so it was just
Changez and then selling it for a high
price once again yes and no I mean it's
hard to generalize and say they all do
it but there's definitely evidence of
that like we've had while fallout was
probably one that comes to mind yeah I
haven't given that any chance I think
the word so rebranding gives it a sort
of negative spin because we always talk
about you know rebranding graphics cars
it's like nothing exciting I think
there's definitely sort of multiple ways
that game developers rebrand their stuff
because I think of a a great example is
Assassin's Creed obviously that game is
a lot of the artwork and assets and
everything's very similar to origins
yeah and all of the systems are very
similar but they actually did do pretty
significant changes to things like the
narrative structure you know the things
you can do in the game the combat system
and that makes it quite a different game
and it makes it a better game whereas
then you think of fallout 76 which is
very similar to fallout 4 but it's like
terrible so I think we're seeing more of
you know game developers putting so much
effort into these big triple-a titles
that they want to get as much out as
possible DLCs been one way to do that
and now in other ways just to sort of
create as another similar game uses as
much of their old stuff as possible yeah
you can make refresh as exciting I'm not
saying yes refreshes but I'm saying the
term refresh you can make a refresh
product exciting but you can refresh a
graphics card and charge a lot less and
it's a new exciting fact and in the case
of these games yogur if what you're
saying like another example would be
Just Cause for yeah now I didn't need
that game to be visually improved from
Just Cause 3 I just needed it to be not
downgraded in certain areas some areas
it is better for sure but other areas
it's not and then the performance
downgrade is massive yeah so if it
looked the same and performed at the
same but it was a whole new exciting
adventure then I think that would be
acceptable yeah and I think there's
there's another game that we've just
recently been looking at his hitman 2
for exam is very similar to hitman 1
yeah except every area is different in
you and if you bought hitman one that's
including the game of hitman two the
only disappointing thing with that one
is that they've seemed to have
downgraded which is really bizarre I
still don't know
we've got an answer this why is it no
directx12 was one of the few games that
worked awesome with DirectX 12 didn't
know initially but by the end of the you
know the patching four and it got to a
really good place and then they've just
script yeah so but I thinking in that in
that game that's a good way to sort of
sure not have to do too much but you're
giving new content and there's enough
new content in that game to make it
warrant it is not just a DLC because
that's kind of some people say like for
that 76 should have just been a DLC for
Fallout 4 yeah I mean it's a final Idol
of their f1 games every year like you
get if there's a new few new tracks on
the calendar will they model those and
add them to the game and then you get
some new cars and then sometimes they
try to add a few new game modes and
things and the way the cars handle so it
is a new game it's not just new skins
yeah like I think there's some games
obviously that don't fall into that like
Shadow the tomb Raider's obviously quite
improved in every way yeah for to
horizon for as well major changes
compared but they were they were
successful exciting games of the year
yeah so what does that tell me an
assassin's creed obviously was also very
popular so there's yeah well it wasn't
terrible it was we were just hoping it
would be a little less clunky than the
previous yeah I mean that was the issue
with that again not necessarily their
bare specs but yep yeah okay we'll get
through this one a bit quicker than we
did the last question this one is
considering how much you guys spend
benchmarking how much actual time do you
get to play games for fun and not for
benchmarking purposes I feel like we
answer this question probably every
second QA I don't know that's true yeah
I feel like I've done a few times I play
it depends it goes I think for me gaming
is a cycle thing so in winter when
there's not much else to do I generally
game in the free time I have with
friends that's a good time of the year
to catch up with friends have a few
drinks relax play some games it's very
much just a social thing for me now
rather than I don't play single-player
or anything like that but right now
we're in summer and I don't really game
at all
it's like any free time I get I'm
usually outside doing things out there
and then back on the computer
benchmarking so yeah
play matches Tommy yeah I'm pretty
consistent throughout the year of
playing regularly but I would say that I
play lots of games they're not baby
maybe an hour or two here and there you
know when there's some free time into
the night or something and that's
usually when but yeah certainly not as
much as I used to well yeah same here
I used to gain quite a lot but I think
most young guys do especially when you
move out of home for the first time and
yeah you've got your own place and that
and it's good to catch up with mates and
play games but yeah unfortunately those
days don't last forever yeah okay
another question from our discord chat
what is the most disappointing game
you've ever played we had a bit of
discussion yeah I always get caught out
with these game ones because I feel like
disappointing games again that really
disappoints you well some of them they
cut your deep and you remember for a
long time I disappointed where some of
them he's like yeah and you move on
quickly and I think for me I did play it
a lot with friends and we did enjoy it
but we we suffered through it you know
in a way and that would have been Red
Alert 3 so huge command &amp;amp; Conquer fan
which some of you guys are probably
aware of and yeah I enjoyed Red Alert 3
probably a lot of people didn't but
where it was disappointing was the game
wasn't nearly as polished as it could
have been the netcode or whatever their
online system was was horrible it took
forever to get a game they were often
laggy and you know it's just a bit of a
nightmare so it was kind of it was
letdown other thing it was so close to
being a really fun great real time
strategy game and then the other one is
that the one you're gonna bring yeah the
one that I was gonna go so this is an
equal for me definitely the remake of
Sim City and that came out recently like
the most recent Sim City game I think
then that was nowhere near as good as
the older ones i pre-ordered that yeah I
know because I'm a big SimCity fan at
heart like so SimCity 2000 basically as
what got me into computers that and the
original DOS version of command &amp;amp;
Conquer so those two games I loved to
bits and
for me the SimCity games never really
captured I think was at 3,000 that came
after 2000 I mean that would make sense
if it was at the time line maybe it was
just straight to fall but I'm not sure I
can't remember there was a follow-up
SimCity that wasn't as good as 2000 it
was still pretty good I enjoyed it I
enjoyed a lot of SimCity 4 yeah I didn't
really get into it after that and then
you know the latest one came out it
looked awesome I was high up I was like
this is gonna be great
and it was clunky around like crap the
maps were really small yeah they got
real like so much stuff so much done
could do yeah
I did yeah so that was a huge year lucky
have city skylines now she's sort of
filled that gap a bit okay next question
is from net Walker from our discord chat
can I get a question for the next QA no
sorry moving on next net Walker's
question is who decides what you
actually I like this question who
decides what you guys do and how do you
work out what that is
so I believe the question is how do we
work out what content we're doing what
products by covering or you know why are
we covering them or if I decide if I
decide to do a big benchmark video or
whatever it may be why do we decide to
do the content that we do it in the
order that we do what I suppose yep is
that one trying to start with that or
you're missin no go ahead
huh so if you don't understand that it's
a really good question I still thought
it through each each of us comes up with
our own sort of content that we want to
cover it's not like you tell me what to
do yeah yeah it's kind we just have our
own projects so each of the videos that
you see on the channel you know Steve's
benchmark videos you all the work that
videos I do I do all the work for that
so yeah just things that interest us you
know important your product won't choose
things that you guys mentioned in the
comments that might be interesting yeah
it's a combination classics yep so yeah
each content piece will have a bit of
everything or just one thing like some
of it may be pressing news so that's
pretty obvious we do that because it's
pressing news and it's worth covering
it's you know relates to what we do on
the channel some of its you like Tim
said interesting products for a product
launch so yeah we
half of that stuff I think for the most
part it's just stuff that interests us
yeah because all of this kind of tech
stuff interests us and you guys are
interested in channel cuz that reason so
it's good it works for everyone the big
benchmark videos sometimes they
requested if they were a request and I
had no interest in doing it I didn't
want to do it then I probably wouldn't
do unless it was massively requested and
I suppose I'd suffer through it for you
guys but generally like I said if
there's something I want to do like I
don't know the 9700 K versus the 8700 K
and a heap of games because you guys are
tossing it which one to buy I'm seeing a
lot of that request at the moment
actually then yeah that's something I
will do so yeah it's just stuff that
interests us mostly I we really shy away
from content that we don't enjoy there
has to be a serious a slob to do it's a
slob you know and it makes that it makes
a bad job what makes the job a job is
end up being something that you're
really passionate about and enjoy so we
really try to avoid that as much as
possible so you know not a lot of
sponsored content or stuff you're
getting paid to make we don't really do
that because yeah that's again not stuff
we want to do so yeah so there won't be
too many vacuum cleaner reviews and
things and I Steve from gamers Nexus
will be disappointed in us alright got
another question here from a discord
chat what Triple A titles expected in
2019 at games you can't wait to get your
hands on for personal enjoyment not for
benchmarking I always hate these
questions not fence just because like I
don't have any really way of answering
them and it sounds like I am NOT a gamer
or don't enjoy gaming when that's not
entirely true I do enjoy gaming but I
don't know why I suppose I've sort of
lost interest in the new upcoming game
so I sort of like them just to arrive
and then if they're good if they don't
need like a million patches on day away
if that broken in some way then I can
just enjoy them it's like a brush of a
brush a breath of fresh air can't even
say nothing that happens that regularly
you know I was looking for to just calls
for alone yeah that's still a fun game
but I was a little bit let down by how
bad the visuals are the water and stuff
like that
Assassin's Creed Odyssey as well that
was a bit of a slog initially I think
they fixed that in a few ways
I'm enjoying playing I'm like 30 hours
you know I enjoy I unpack yeah so yeah I
mean yeah I just sound like a negative
Nancy when it comes to these questions
what have you got team Boris um I mean
I'm in a similar position in there I
guess back back a couple years back I
was much more interested in sort of you
know what's the release schedule looking
like for you know the rest of the year
what's the cool stuff to to play but my
backlog of games I want to play is so
large now because I don't have as much
time to play them that's right it's not
like I'm waiting for the next game it's
that you know I can
when I finished Assassin's Creed Odyssey
there's another like I want to play
hitman I want to play a bit of
battlefield won't do all these other
games so it's not not as much waiting
for the future is just playing what
we'll have access to now I mean there's
games like your metro coming out next
year that was I really enjoyed those
previous games yeah I'm going to check
that I'm interested to see how anthem is
because and EA will absolutely stuff
that up in some way and I'm just waiting
to see see there we are cheery again
that was an obsidian game that was just
recently teased that looks pretty good I
like obsidian the past oh yeah that's
sort of thing but again like for the
foreseeable future they'll always be
something my backlog that I can just
pick up well yeah we're next wanna play
something yeah so I'm always excited by
like you Starcraft type games command &amp;amp;
Conquer the real time strategies but
like what's on the horizon for those
it's kind of a dead John route the
moment isn't it those games tend to just
come out of nowhere it's like they're
just very quickly announced they're out
there yeah them yeah and yeah there's
lot of interesting stuff like more indie
sort of niche strategy tiles these days
man yeah so probably Starcraft three in
ten years for me
yep I'm looking forward to okay another
question from our discord with high
refresh VA panels does adaptive sync
eliminate ghosting or is it simply a
pixel refresh issue for that technology
that adaptive simply can't eliminate oh
yeah so adaptive sync and response times
ghosting that sort of thing are
basically completely unrelated I think
there was a lot of this confusion comes
from a report
Oh a long time ago back around the
launch of this technology
I think someone did some dodgy test
testing and I think they eventually said
that they hadn't done it correctly to
begin with that sort of was comparing I
think free sync with g-sync
and showing free sync monitor to have
worst ghosting but actually is like a
different panel they see respect I think
it was PC perspectives that do and then
they admitted their mistake later in
colleges but I think I remember that
story yeah so I think a lot of people
sort of read that report and then didn't
see the follow up content they sort of
disprove that yeah so yeah I think
that's where this link this real link
between things comes from the reality is
that the response times have simply
dictated by the panel and the technology
that goes into it so VA it's one of the
slowest of the panel types it's just the
way that they create the crystals and
everything that goes into that panel
makes it quite slow to transition and
adaptive sync is a completely different
part of the display you know I guess
pipeline it's kind of like that's the
that's integrated to the scaler and not
into the panel itself so integrating
adaptive sink really has no impact on
our response times okay one from Bruce
bellend
have you considered benchmarking the
impact of de novo on games performance
so this is sort of a DRM type thing I
don't know if there's any possible way
of doing that do you know yeah because
I'm pretty sure that games that get
cracked to remove de nouveaux just fool
it well yeah it doesn't remove and it
just tricks it into hearing that it's
authenticating I was finding interesting
when people say that a game like
Assassin's Creed origins runs better
when it's cracked because deliver
actually isn't removed from that game no
not crack it yeah
so that's not one I can give too much
insight on the software side of how all
that stuff works is definitely not my
forte but as far as I know you can't
really strip it out of games to then
benchmark them without it unless there's
a game out there that has been cracked
and it's been successfully removed if
there is feel free let me know all right
Steve
do you think Intel will move on from the
i3 i5 i7 + i9 naming scheme with their
successor to the sky like refreshes any
ideas and a hundred and nine ninety K
surely not I have to think they sure
when I go with that so this is the
coffee like we're talking about isn't it
yes for their next products yeah surely
they keep the core i3 in there something
yeah well I would have thought Core i3
i5 I yeah whatever that will stick
around because they've sort of made that
look like kind of well it's a brand
everyone recognizes when you can buy a
laptop or whatever you know that an i5
is better than i3 and so on and so forth
and they just introduced I nines they've
got that huge family now of varying
products as for the actual model names
though of what goes after the iron iron
part hmm I've got nothing
yeah they're gonna have to come up with
something because they can't use ten ten
nineteen ninety K or whatever
nine hundred ninety K yeah that's wrong
that's no good yeah 1099 yeah okay we'll
stop there we'll hit pause and we'll
pick up part two probably tomorrow on
the channel so stick around for that and
yeah hopefully you guys enjoyed well
what's the first half of the last Q&amp;amp;A of
the year I get that right that's right
yep
so yeah Merry Christmas in advance but
will probably say that again in
tomorrow's video and yeah if you enjoyed
this video hit the like button subscribe
