own box today we'll be taking a look at
the msi gt80 3 vr 7 RF Titan SOA this is
definitely the most powerful gaming
laptop that i've ever reviewed it's got
2 nvidia geforce gtx 1080s in sli inside
one with an intel core i7 7920 HQ
processor 64 gigabytes of ddr4 ram and
two 256 gigabyte SSDs in raid 0 so
there's a ton of powerful hardware in
this laptop and of course it does come
at a price this laptop will set you back
more than five thousand US dollars and
more than seven thousand Australian
dollars so you'll definitely have to pay
a high premium to get this powerful
hardware in a laptop form factor the
first thing you'll notice about this
eighteen point four inch laptop is that
it is absolutely enormous
it is 5.5 kilogram heavy it's 69
millimeters thick and while you can take
it around it is somewhat portable it's
not nearly as portable as some of the
smaller 15 and 14 inch gaming laptops
that you can get today this laptop is
meant to be sitting on a desk for the
majority of the time part of the reason
for this as well as that it requires two
enormous power bricks to power the two
GPUs inside each of these huge bricks is
heavy
they're 330 was each for 660 watts total
power draw and if you wanted to bring
this laptop to someone else's house for
example you also need to lug along these
two enormous bricks so that's something
to keep in mind and kind of tracks a
little bit from the portability of the
laptop as this laptop is so large
there's quite a lot of room for ports
around the edges now as impressed with
the array the msi includes here you'll
get on the right-hand side 2 USB 3.0
type 8 ports on the left-hand side
there's two 3.5 mm audio jacks and
s/pdif optical audio out there's also a
hi-fi audio out so it's got all your
audio needs covered right there three
USB 3.0 type-a ports and an SD card
reader on the rear there's HDMI 2.0
Ethernet Thunderbolt three mini
DisplayPort and of course the
proprietary power connector it's also
worth mentioning this
top comes with 5 3 watt speakers inside
which I you know reasonable enough
quality for a laptop but let's be honest
if you're playing games watching movies
or listening to music you'll probably
want to plug in a set of headphones or
external speakers or something like that
of course there's a lot of ports to set
on this device one of the things you've
probably already noticed about the GTA
III VR is that it includes a mechanical
keyboard so I guess if you have this
much space to use on a laptop you may as
well put in a cherry MX keyboard on here
powered by SteelSeries as well each of
the key switches is a Cherry MX
RGB speed silver so it's very fast one
point two millimeter actuation 45 grams
of force required it's a beautiful
keyboard to use for typing and gaming
yet fantastic tactile feedback of course
it's leagues better than any other sort
of gaming laptop keyboard that I've used
it's in fact well it's pretty much
equivalent to the mechanical keyboard I
use on a daily basis with my desktop so
there's not a whole lot to complain
about here one of the things I will
point out is that because it's a laptop
the keyboard is raised slightly more
than you typically see per se just a
standalone peripheral keyboard so
there's also no wrist rest so these two
things combined don't make it the
perfect sort of laptop for typing out
documents or anything like that but I
think while you're gaming you'll find
the mechanical keyboard to be awesome
and of course it's RGB as well so you
can go into the SteelSeries utility
include on the laptop and customize all
the individual keys to whatever color
you want there's number of presets as
well to choose from so you can do a
number of cool effects like you see on
most RGB keyboards bass days that
certainly adds a little bit of flair to
this laptop and it's nice to see one of
the most contentious issues about the GT
83 VR is something I've seen a lot of
comments about is the position of the
trackpad on the right hand side of the
keyboard instead of below it of course
because there is the mechanical keyboard
here they couldn't put it in a standard
laptop position and that lives in a
somewhat this awkward position on the
side here I thought this would be pretty
terrible to use to be honest but when I
got my hands on the laptop and I started
using the trackpad in this awkward ooh
script you can see here it wasn't
actually that bad browsing around the
operating system is
possible and quite easy to do in this
position and well it actually surprised
me quite a lot in that regard of course
you won't want to use it for gaming at
all
it is quite bad to use there but of
course most people replug in an external
mouth like you do with most gaming
laptops the trackpad also doubles as a
numpad but there's no physical keys so
it's like typing on a touchscreen and
experience there isn't particularly good
but I guess if you need it is ver and
included here before I get into the
performance of the GTA V 3 of you I just
want to touch briefly on the display
because it's quite an odd choice here by
MSI they've gone with an 18 point 4 inch
1080p IPS LCD and just 60 Hertz now as
I'll know earlier I mentioned that this
laptop has two gtx 1080s
in sli inside which to be honest
absolutely crushes games at 1080p 60 so
i really would have preferred to see is
a higher resolution display like 1440p
or 4k because these GPUs are well suited
to those resolutions or a higher refresh
panel with g-sync
something like 120 Hertz at 1080p which
we've seen before in laptops so it's a
very odd choice to limit you to 1080p
and 60 Hertz in such an expensive laptop
but I think what msi is trying to do
here is they figure you're going to be
plugging in perhaps an external display
that has either higher resolutions or
higher refresh rates and I think to get
the best experience ever gta3 vr you
will be wanting to use an external
display moving on to the performance
here and first of all be looking at the
CPU specifically has the core i7 79 20
HQ compares to the more commonly used
7700 HQ which you'll find in most gaming
laptops the 79 20 HQ is a 3.1 gigahertz
base clock over 4 cores with a boost up
to 4 point 1 gigahertz in some
situations compared to the 7700 HQ we're
seeing 5% more performance in
center-based single-threaded and 10%
more in multi-threaded in our x264
encoding benchmark we are seeing an
extra 10% they're up to 20% more
performance in winrar 12% more
performance in the PC mark work test and
overall we're looking at 13% more
performance on average so it's a decent
little bit more performer
17700 HQ but nothing earth-shattering
from the slightly higher clock in the
7920 HQ it's also worth mentioning the
3d mark time spy benchmark which is the
most graphically intensive of all the 3d
mark workloads compared to the MSI gt70
3br which includes just one GTX 1080
the GP 83 VR which is GTX 1080s and SOI
is 68 percent more powerful so we're
seeing not 100% scaling from the SOI
configuration here that's mostly due to
a CPU speed limit moving on to games
testing now and I tested the GT 83 VI
here at 1080p because that is the screen
resolution of this laptop and we'll
start with some older tiles so in Tomb
Raider
I thought 91% more performance from the
penalty SOI compared to the GT 73 reales
just a single GT x 1080 inside so
there's pretty decent scaling here in
this title but some of the other older
games I tested like Metro last lights or
no change in performance BioShock
Infinite was an additional 20% from the
exit of GTX 1080 and middle-earth of
shadow of mortal and extra 10 percent
performance from the extra 1080 so not a
whole ton of extra performance here from
the additional 1080 but most of these
titles are limited by CPU performance
and run well over a hundred FPS at 1080p
in Grand Theft Auto 5 I saw an
additional 20% performance from the
extra 1080 so again not a huge change
here in Batman Arkham Knight I saw no
change to performance in newer titles
like rise of the Tomb Raider I saw an
extra 44 percent performance improvement
where the GTX 10 a DSLR is running with
maximum settings at just over 60 fps in
that configuration in Deus Ex mankind
divided again no change to performance
here which is a little bit disappointing
to see from a modern title that I here
supposedly supports SLI but you know I
actually didn't see any performance
improvements here in a few other games
that I don't have charts for like hitman
actually turning on SOI hurt the
performance of this title in DirectX 12
compared to running with just a single
1080 and in the game like civilization 6
this game is so heavily dependent on the
sea
you that adding in an extra 10 80 as
well doesn't really impact the
performance too much at 1080p with most
of the games that are usually test with
running at well over 60 frames per
second with the GTX 1080i so I I thought
I've really got to find a game that will
show off the performance powerhouses for
GTA III VR at 1080p and that game was
watchdogs to cranking up all the
settings here to their maximum and
running out four times MSAA
I managed to bring the average frames
per second down to around 40 to 50
during just you know driving around the
city and having a bit of fun so there
are some games out there that will
punish the GTX 1080s in this laptop and
you won't be able to hit 60 frames per
second but of course you can simply turn
the msaa down to two times or crank some
of those shadow settings down slightly
so if you run again well over 60 frames
per second with minimums above 60 as
well watchdogs to was just one outlier
that I could find most titles that I
tested with ran at above 60 frames per
second and minimum is above 60 at 1080p
so use the real power of the GT X 1080
SLR inside this laptop you really will
want to plug in a 1440p or 4k display
and game of those higher resolutions
because you're really you're spending
$5,000 on a laptop with top-end
performance you'll want to really make
those gtx eternity sol run a hundred
percent utilization and for that you
will need higher screen resolutions or
something with a higher refresh rate
I'll also briefly touch on the thermal
performance of this laptop of course it
has a beefy cooling solution inside but
I did see in my punishing i-264 test
that the CPU was sitting at around 95
degrees Celsius and one of the GPUs was
sitting at 88 degrees Celsius the second
GPU is around 78 degrees Celsius here
and this isn't really a real-world
indication of what you'll see in games
typically I sort of see you sitting more
like 85 degrees C and the GPU also at 85
degrees C in most games but if you are
punishing this laptop and running
everything at 100% you will run into a
few thermal issues here I think maybe
running the C period 95 degrees C is a
little bit hot but there is a turbofan
button
you can press on this laptop it cranks
the laptop from quite loud to extremely
laughs sort of noise levels but that
does reduce those temperatures by five
to ten degrees most of the time and
whilst the up does run somewhat
hot and quite loud there is room for
overclocking through the msi dragon
center you can push it up to 4.2
gigahertz on all four cores on the CPU
and you can also add an extra two
hundred megahertz to the clock of the
GPU this doesn't have a massive impact
on the thermals of this laptop so for
most of you out there you may as well
just push it to the limits and see what
it can do because well you spent $5,000
on a laptop so you may as well try and
get as much performance as you possibly
can having now used the msi gt80 3 VR
for a couple of weeks now there's no
doubt in my mind that this is the most
powerful gaming laptop I have ever
tested it's not significantly faster
than a single GT X 1080 laptop at 1080p
but if you are planning on plugging in
an external display something that's
higher resolution like 1440p or 4k or if
you want to use something higher refresh
you really will benefit from the extra
GT X 1080 inside the GT 83 DVR and I
think that's pretty much what you'd
expect from a laptop that costs five
thousand dollars or seven thousand
Australian dollars you will want the
most power possible in a laptop form
factor and you definitely get this with
the GTA III VR I was also very impressed
with the mechanical keyboard that is
included here gives great tactile
feedback in games and of course it's RGB
as well so you can customize it to
however you like I think that's really
something that you want when you're
spending this much money on a laptop I'm
still not quite sure who has five
thousand dollars to spend on a gaming
laptop but if you do have that sort of
money to burn it and you want the most
powerful Hardware you can possibly get
MSI will provide it to you in the GTA
III VR
unless that's it for this video review I
hope you guys enjoyed it I'm your host
Tim and I'll catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
