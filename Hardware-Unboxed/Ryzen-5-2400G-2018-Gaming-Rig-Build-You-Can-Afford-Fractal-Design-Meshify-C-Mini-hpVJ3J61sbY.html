today's video we're going to be building
a gaming pc that you can actually afford
inside the brand-new fractal designer
mesh fic mini that's assuming you have a
budget of around $700 u.s. which
admittedly is still quite a bit but
today that really doesn't get you much
in the world of PC hardware and not that
long ago you could build a very
respectable gaming PC for well under
$1000 u.s. today though not so much
typically I'd recommend anyone keen on
PC gaming game for something like a gtx
1060 or an rx 570 they usually cost
around $200 u.s. today though yet
probably looking at more like three
hundred and fifty dollars and that's
half the price of today's budget PC
build even entry-level graphics cards
such as the GTX 1050 and rx 560 cost
around 160 to 170 dollars u.s. today and
not the hundred dollars you'd normally
expect to pay granted today's solution
isn't quite that powerful but it will
certainly tie you over and offer a
flexible upgrade to a more powerful
discreet graphics card once pricing
settles down in fact PC gamers face not
just one hurdle but two in addition to
the high graphics card prices we also
have inflated ddr4 memory prices
therefore with today's PC build we've
somewhat attempted to address these
issues by providing gamers with a solid
foundation that they can build upon in
the future horizon 520 400 G and value
11 GPU have proven they can deliver very
playable performance at 1080p in most
modern titles albeit with low to medium
quality settings but rather than build
the cheapest possible system that you
can around the 2400 G for this build
we're taking a different approach things
like coolers motherboards cases power
supplies and even SSDs are all very well
priced today and investing in quality
products here can save your money down
the track while also enhancing the
experience today as luck would have it
coinciding with this build is the
release of the new fractal design mesh
if I see mini a micro ATX case built
upon the award-winning mesh fic design
essentially what fractal designers done
here is take the original
if I see and shrink it down to create
the mini version pretty much like what
they did with the define mini for
example you still get the same look and
high airflow design it's just a wee bit
smaller or shorter rather 9% shorter in
fact so the case is said to be coming in
at 90 dollars us which is a little
pricey the cooler master master box like
3.1 for example can be had for just $50
us the mesh if I see many though is a
much better quality case in my opinion
that will handle higher-end hardware
without an issue so there's certainly
room to grow with this case then for the
motherboard now we could spend as a list
$60 on the asrock a B 350 M or MSI B 350
M Pro but I found these cheaper boards
are a bit of a hit and miss when it
comes to overclocking and running at
higher memory speeds above the AMD spec
you also limited to just two DIMM slots
which makes future memory upgrades very
costly and since we are starting with 8
gigabytes of ddr4 memory for this build
having the ability to flexibly upgrade
your memory in the future it would
certainly be a welcomed feature
therefore I've selected the MSI be 350
mortar I've had good overclocking
success on this board already with the
rise in 320 200 G so I thought I'd give
the Rison 520 400 G a shot the feature
sets also great and it offers flexible
memory upgrades with four dimm slots
again it's a little pricey at $90 u.s.
but I think over time that additional
investment will pay off once again I'm
going with the deep core gamax 200 T to
cool the overclocked to 2400 G it's a
Ripper of a cooler for just $20 u.s.
though it is often found on sale for
around $10 making it an incredibly good
buy fractal design is also set along
there Celsius s 24 which is a nice
option if you plan to upgrade the CPU to
something with a higher core count in
the future then as I said earlier
keeping the cost down we're going to
start with 8 gigabytes of ddr4 3000
memory from Team Group there t false
dark it looks great and at $100 it's
well-priced once memory prices start to
fall away hopefully at the end of the
year or buy the latest early next year
at that point you'd be bound by a second
kit at a much lower price or at least
that's the dream anyway for storage I
recommending you crucial MX 500
500 gigabyte SSD it's a great value
option 135 dollars US costing just 27
cents per gigabyte you can get the 250
gigabyte model for a bit less at $80 but
it actually ends up costing more at a
cost of 32 cents per gigabyte so it's
almost 20 percent more costly in terms
of capacity therefore adopt for the 500
gigabyte model and that way you'd have
to juggle installed games were in the
SSD and a slower but larger hard drive
then finally powering everything we have
the Edison M 750 watt though finding
this model in the US seems to be next to
impossible while a nice power supply
it's probably overkill for this build
even with future expansions in mind
therefore I recommend the C Sonic M 12
to 520 what bronze rated power supply
for just $50 all up the build comes to a
total cost of around six hundred and six
dollars u.s. and you have the makings of
a really great gaming PC for now the
Vega 11 integrated graphics will get you
by and once graphics card prices come
back down or if you can throw in a two
hundred dollar model and enjoy higher
quality 1080p gaming so let's overclock
the Rison 520 400 G and see how it runs
inside the fractal design and mesh if I
see mini actually before I did any
overclocking I tested this little rig in
its stock into the box configuration
with the glass side panel removed and
then with it installed and both were
hour long gaming stress tests with the
door panel removed to the 2400 G picked
at 45 degrees which is very cool indeed
and please note for all the testing I
did maintain an ambient room temperature
of 21 degrees or at least my office
climate control did anyway this is still
an excellent result so I popped the
glass panel on and continued the stress
testing installing the side panel made
very little difference the APU
temperature increased by just one or two
degrees and with just three 120
millimeter fans in total the two case
fans and the one on the deep core game
acts 200 T spinning it well under 200
rpm the system was virtually silent in
fact the case fans were spinning at just
900 rpm while the CPU fans spun at 1300
rpm and well that explains why I was
having a hard time telling if the system
was even running a
apart from the fact that there was stuff
on the screen but you know what I mean
then when it came time to overclock I
didn't have as much luck with the risin
5 2400 G as I did with the 2200 G the
CPU overclock was 100 megahertz lower
and the GP was 50 megahertz lower not a
significant difference but it was
interesting to note that in the
overwatch stress test I saw virtually
the same performance between these true
overclocked AEP use anyway relating to
this video the overclocked 2400 G and
the mesh fic mini maxed out at just 61
degrees so another great result it's
only 5 to 6 degrees warmer than the 2200
G overall what we have here in my
opinion is a great little gaming PC
little toy you ever nicely tool graphics
card pricing becomes reasonable or the
next generation comes along at which
point we hope that graphics card pricing
will correct the beauty of the horizon 5
2400 G is that it is an 8 threaded CPU
is plenty of raw power so if you're in
the market for sale verizon fire 1500 X
or Core i5 7600 k slash core i3 80 350 K
then the 2400 G presenter is a much
better option as it offers a similar
level of CPU processing power with what
is essentially a free entry-level GPU
thrown in as a nice little bonus this
means down the track when you'll no
doubt throw in a discreet graphics card
for that extra gaming performance and
you go for something like a GTX 1060
maybe a 1070 or even a 1080 if you're
lucky then you'll be in a position to
take full advantage of it at that point
you might want to throw in another 8
gigabytes of RAM but that's easily done
thanks to our motherboard choice the
fractal design mesh if I see mini will
also be with you for years to come it's
a fantastic case and while it doesn't do
or offer anything new over the larger
ATX version doesn't really need to and
I'm sure many of you will agree that the
mesh fic series was as close to
perfection as cases get right now
especially for less than $100 US should
you come into more money in the future
which would be nice I can't imagine
you'd find the need to ditch this case
or get rid of it the build quality is
excellent as I said the design is really
as good as it gets
especially for a micro ATX case
you've got room to throw in nice
expensive full-length graphics cards
they'll go in without a problem
you could put in a much taller air
cooler than the gamax 200 tears I use
and as you can see here you can also
quite comfortably install a two hundred
and forty eight millimeter radiator in
the top and there's plenty of clearance
for your memory modules and things like
that because the radiator is offset so
that is a nice design feature there by
fractal design out-of-the-box thermals
they are excellent but you can throw in
a few more 120 millimeter fans if you
want for this configuration it's
completely unnecessary the two case fans
that it came with were more than
sufficient to get the job done but you
can stick another one in the front and
then two in the top but of now that I've
installed the all-in-one liquid cooler
we already have the two on the top there
and of course by default there is the
one in the back but if you were to
upgrade to a higher-end graphics card
like the GTX 1082 I that I just showed
or maybe a second generation eight core
rising CPU for example then you can
throw a few more fans in and increase
the airflow if you care about bullying
then you can also throw in an LED light
strip to jazz things up and maybe go
with some custom sleeve power cables now
I'm sure they'll be those that were
quick to point out that we featured a
rainbow-colored 24-pin power cable this
build but that was kind of the idea it's
a budget build and sleeve cables really
have no place or certainly make no sense
in a budget build I'll admit in 2016
this kind of gaming performance for just
under $700 us probably wouldn't have
impressed anyone so it doesn't really
feel like progress but anyway in early
2018 this really is without a question
as good as it gets for those wanting to
buy a new hardware on a positive note
though we have a really solid foundation
here a great case great motherboard
memory all that stuff once those pesky
graphics cards come down in price even
1440p gaming for just a few hundred
extra dollars could be a reality and on
that note I'm going to end this one I
