of why building a gaming PC right now is
a bad idea
previously we tackled DDR for pricing
but today we'll be checking out graphics
cards it's fair to say at the start of
2018 has been a wild ride for the tech
industry and not just for tech giants
but also consumers just as we thought
GPU pricing was finally starting to
settle down a late 2017 it's gone
completely berserk and is really worse
than ever there are a few reasons for
why this has happened and these reasons
have all come together to create the
perfect storm these issues include
demand from cryptocurrency miners
increased memory prices and an explosion
in the demand of Chinese gamers wanting
to win a chicken dinner you know survive
a round of pub G the major attributing
factor I'd say is the fact that
cryptocurrency mining profitability is
way up for example a theorem is
skyrocketed since December jumping from
around $450 us to almost $1000 by the
end of the month right now or at least
at the time of piecing this video
together the value has just hit over
$1200 that's almost a hundred and
seventy percent increase in about a
month and a half
no wonder miners are snapping up every
last GPU they can get their hands on a
theorem is also just one example there
are no doubt more up-and-coming crypto
currencies exciting miners so while we
expected cryptocurrency mining to start
cooling off in 2018 so far the opposite
has occurred as I said in the previous
episode when we talked about ddr4 memory
pricing which has been driven up due to
a lack of supply during a time of high
demand or price fixing well the same
things really happening with gddr5
memory and the expected that this RAM
shortage will increase the cost of
gr√•vik's cards mid-range graphics cards
are projected to cost anywhere from five
to twenty dollars us more and this will
no doubt impact higher-end graphics
cards with even more gddr5 memory on
board even more that by itself isn't
really a significant factor but when you
lump it in with all the other issues
that does add up so the cost of
producing a graphics card
I'd say that five to twenty dollar
estimate for the mid-range card assumes
normal market conditions that figure
could certainly be amplified with such
an extreme demand that we're seeing
right now call us from miners and gamers
I suppose many gamers seem to be
pointing the finger and NVIDIA claiming
price gouging or some other underhanded
tactics I don't believe this was true
though as was the case for much of last
year this also impacts pricing if AMD
graphics cards it just so happens that
right now there is a slightly higher
demand for NVIDIA GPUs in fact a
possible explanation for this could be
the Chinese market wanting to play pub
gee I've recently spent quite a lot of
time benchmarking both CPUs and GPUs and
the massively popular player on owns
battlegrounds over a dozen CPUs were
tested and many dozen GPUs and what I
found was the game pretty much hates AMD
Hardware unfortunately because the game
is built on the Unreal Engine 4 which
was designed in collaboration with
Nvidia at a time when Intel CPUs ruled
it's none too kind to AMD GPUs or CPUs
this is a real problem for AMD as the
battle royal title is one of the most
popular games on the planet right now
and even while looking to play pub G
will likely buy an NVIDIA GPU as they
offer superior performance thanks to
their influence when developing the game
engine China has gone nuts over pub G
and as a result the majority of Steam
users now appear to be Chinese or at
least used the most commonly spoken
language in the world
Chinese readers account for 64 percent
of steam hardware survey respondents
compared to just eight point six percent
which was seen in 2016 of those Chinese
gamers it's estimated that almost eighty
percent of them own player and owns
battlegrounds and have spent a
considerable amount of time playing it
this then helps to explain why the
GeForce GTX 1060 series has shot up to
number one position for the most widely
used graphics card on the steam hardware
survey almost 15 percent of all gamers
using steam now Rock gtx 1060 the gtx
750ti came in second the gtx 960 and
third and the 1052 I missed out on a
podium spot by a few percent shockingly
the top 13 GPUs are all Nvidia based and
they make up for a
whopping 71% of the steam user base so
as I said earlier this looks to have
created the perfect storm smashing GPU
pricing and availability the situation
game is a face with is pretty horrific
right now there's really no other way to
put it in fact pricing is just part of
the problem and while a very big problem
just getting your hands on a graphics
card right now at any price can be a
real challenge here's a breakdown of the
current pricing as well as a look at
prices back in November and April of
2017 now please note these are average
asking prices not the absolute best or
worst prices you've got to find online
but rather what we deemed to be the
typical asking price at the time based
on data from various online retailers in
the u.s. it's pretty clear that things
have gotten well out of hand here
availability and pricing of amy's radeon
RX vega line that's been sketchy since
release really in august of last year
and and although things did settle down
briefly in november prices of since shot
up and it's really next to impossible
even find one in stock meanwhile the rx
500 series is also mostly unavailable
you can find some at various retailers
but again prices have just skyrocketed
the rx 580 for example isn't far off
costing three times the MSRP that's
insane
meanwhile the rx 570 is over three times
more expensive than the MSRP though we
are only seeing a slight increase for
the less desirable rx 560 it's the same
situation with the Green Team don't
expect to get a GeForce graphics card
for anywhere near a reasonable price
right now the GTX 1066 gigabyte which
should sell for 250 dollars is going for
over five hundred dollars and the 1070
is just as bad this is the worst GPU
pricing situation I can ever recall
saying surely prices can't stay this
inflated for too long can they on that
note I honestly don't know when graphics
card pricing will return to normal
levels or even start heading down
towards the MSRP s memory pricing will
remain an issue throughout 2018 so you
can expect to pay some kind of premium
this year for your graphics card
the demand from Chinese gamers should
start to cool off soon and that just
leaves us with the gamers best friend
the cryptocurrency miner I'd expect that
mining will continue to see hot runs
throughout 2018 so that will likely make
buying a new graphics card a bit tricky
on a final note I often read comments
from gamers who are angry with either
AMD or Nvidia blaming them for creating
the shortages in order to price gouge
and go on a claim they could simply
increase production and offset the rise
in demand sadly though that really isn't
the situation at all
neither AMD nor Nvidia owned the
semiconductor manufacturing fabrication
plants that produce their GPUs for that
they primarily outsource to see SMC
otherwise known as Taiwanese
semiconductor manufacturing company more
recently AMD does now use Global
Foundries but the point is neither own
these plants when supply runs short like
what we're currently seeing due to our
high demand there really isn't much that
can be done in the short term to solve
this if the plants are running at or
near 100% capacity you can't just
magically increase capacity further at
least not without a massive investment
and I mean massive even if you make that
investment it's really years before I'll
even be realised fabs require many
expensive devices function and take
years to build estimates put the cost at
building a new fab at well over 1
billion dollars u.s. values as high as 3
to 4 billion
aren't uncommon in fact tsmc invested
9.3 billion in its fab 15 300-millimeter
wafer manufacturing facility in taiwan
TSMC has also estimated that future fabs
might cost in the vicinity of 20 billion
dollars so it's not feasible or even
remotely realistic to invest that kind
of money to try and address what's
likely a limited time only increase in
demand at least in the grand scheme of
things this means as was the situation
when investigating the high ddr4 prices
things won't really improve till demand
drops off and when that's gonna happen
for GP users i suppose anyone's guess
really it's not clear like I said
there's many factors at play here
but right now it really does mean that
building a new gaming PC is going to be
significantly more costly than it oughta
be so much so that we would recommend
you hold off if possible so you'd have a
disappointing way to end this video but
that's the situation we're faced with
unfortunately so let me know what you
guys think about all this in the comment
section below as always I read all your
comments and love to hear your thoughts
anyway that's going to do it for this
one part 3 of this series will be coming
very soon and until then take it easy
I'm your host Steve I'll catch you again
soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
