showdown between the core i5 8,400 and
rise in v 2600 has been in the making
for a few weeks now and I'm glad all the
testings finally done I'm not gonna mess
around too much here and I will get to
the results as soon as possible before I
do though a quick message about our
sponsor Squarespace who's been kind
enough to support our work whether you
need a domain website or online store
make up with Squarespace for more
information please check the link in the
video description again really
appreciate their support these big
benchmark videos are a massive
undertaking so please check them out
okay so before we get into the benchmark
results and I promise there is a
boatload of them here are a few quick
notes on the test setup the core i5 8400
rig features the MSI B 360 gaming plus a
high quality B 360 board that has no
trouble getting the most out of the six
core CPU of course we are limited to
ddr4 2666 on this board but we've gone
with G skills higher quality and very
low latency flair Excel 14 memory and
then finally cooling 8400 is the Intel
Box cooler then for the horizon 5 2600
the seuss ROG cross s7 hero was used for
testing and we have two configurations
here a stock out of the box
configuration using the g.skill flex
sale 14 memory clocked at 29 33 while
the CPU is cooled using the wraith
stealth box cooler then we have a 4.2
gigahertz all core overclock using
aggressively tuned g.skill sniper
exterior for 3400 memory with Titan sub
timings and the cooler has been upgraded
to the Corsair H 115 I Pro so for
testing we have 36 games on the menu and
each has been tested at 720p 1080p and
1440p using the GeForce GTX 1080 Ti I
would have liked to have included Vegas
64 liquid as well but for this single
video I have run 324 individual tests
three times each so that's almost 1,000
benchmark runs and I wasn't really super
keen on making that 2000 runs
perhaps once I've built up the courage
again I'll revisit this video but with
Vega for
we have the GTX TCI results so grab a
drink some snacks and get comfortable
first that we have Ark survival evolved
and this isn't a title I often test with
but dude a popular request it has been
included with these slew of games tested
in this video it is often listed in the
top 10 most played games on Steam so I
imagine there are quite a few of you
keen to see the results I was expecting
this one to go poorly for Aizen I have
to admit but the results are quite
surprising we are mostly GPU bound
though at 720p we do see your eyes and
edging ahead so that is quite
interesting still due to the GPU
limitations at the overclocked Rison 5
2600 was no faster than the stock
configuration another game that's quite
popular on Steam and always heavily
requested is ARMA 3 in the past this
game has run horribly on AMD processors
including Rison but I have been told the
games been updated recently to better
utilize the rise in CPUs or at least
CPUs with more than a single core and
that certainly appears to be the case
out of the box the horizon 520 600 had
no trouble matching the core i5 8400 and
this titles clearly CPU limited as they
overclocked 2600 offered impressive
gains even at 1440p we saw a massive 20%
increase in performance at overclocking
horizons cores and memory this meant the
2600 was now 19% fast and the core i5
8400 when comparing the average frame
rate I'm quite shocked with these
results given how poorly Rison performed
last time I tested with ARMA 3 alright
come on
you new ashes of the benchmark was going
to be included and it's about the only
game that supports DirectX 12 that I've
tested using DirectX 12 with the GeForce
graphics card I should just quickly note
though that I did retest ashes of the
singularity using Vegas 64 liquid I'm
not going to provide those results but I
just want to make note that the margins
actually didn't change so that's quite
interesting and again that is of course
using the DirectX 12 API anyway here we
see at the core i5 8400 Verizon 5 2600
are very evenly matched out-of-the-box
testing at 1080p and 1440p does says
primarily GPU bound with the crazy
preset enabled so overclocking Rison
really isn't of any benefit here at
1440p just a 5% increase is seen
7% at ADP and a reasonably impressive
11% at 720p okay so some interesting
results seen in Assassin's Creed origins
let's talk about what's going on here
you'll notice that these stock Verizon v
2600 allows for the exact same
performance at 1080p that it does at
720p that's because we are CPU limited
overclocking does solve this though and
at 1080p we say the 2600 is able to
match the 8400 however both CPUs are now
GPU limited we know this because at 720p
the overclocked 2600 is able to pull
ahead of 8400 but a noteworthy margin
for the average framerate then finally
at 1440p we're almost entirely GPU bound
here though the stock rise at 5 2600
configuration does still struggle to max
out the gtx 1080 TI
testing with battlefield 1 shows just
how good the core i5 8400 is out of the
box with no messing around
it delivers very strong performance in
this demanding title the horizon 5 2600
is also very respectable and while it
was only 6 percent slower for the frame
time result at 1080p the average frame
rate was 12% lower that margin is
somewhat nullified at 1440p as we become
heavily GPU bound though it is
interesting to note that overclocked
even at this resolution the 2600
provides a much better 1% low result
then at the lower resolutions we see
that overclocked in the 2600 improves
the average frame rate by almost 20% and
while that is an impressive gain it does
only make the jr. Eisen process a few
percent faster than the core i5 8400 but
again it's the 1440p results that are
most impressive and here the 2600 was
18% fast and the 8400 for the frame time
result here we see the stock risin 5
2600 gets trampled in Star Wars
Battlefront - and creates a serious
bottleneck for the gtx 980ti
limiting performance even at 1440p
incredibly at 720p and 1080p we see
massive performance gains when
overclocking gains of around 40% with
this overclock the all core clock
frequency has been increased by 16%
but we've also boosted the memory
frequency by 16% however more crucially
are the greatly improved memory sub
timings
combine all these factors together in a
core heavy game and we asked
truly massive performance gains that
said though it is well worth noting that
it took an aggressive all core
overclocked ultra expensive memory that
was custom tuned and an upgraded cooler
for the horizon 520 600 to basically
match the core i5 8400 in this title so
while the gains and overall performance
was excellent the cost to achieve this
was great
Counter Strike global Offensive is the
complete opposite the Star Wars
Battlefront 2 in the sense that it
doesn't utilize core heavy CPUs well at
all even so the performance margin
between the Rison 5 2600 and core i5
8400 wasn't that big I was really
expecting the 8400 to run away with it
in this title overclock though the 2600
took charge and was able to edge out the
8400 at both 1080p and 1440p again the
margins weren't big so overall
performance was much the same using
either CPU for testing Deus Ex mankind
divided I'm not using the in-game
benchmark but I am using the DirectX 11
API as this is a better choice when
using a GeForce GPU particularly for
this title here we see better
performance from the core i5 8400 at
720p and turn DP when compared to these
stock Rison 5 2600 configuration
overclocking Rison does allow it to
match and even beat the 8400 we see that
with the GPU bottleneck removed at 720p
the rise in CPU is indeed faster once
overclocked by the time we hit the 1440p
resolution the playing field is
neutralized and performance is much the
same across all three test
configurations moving on a dirt 4 and
here we see out of the box at the core
i5 and rise and 5 processors are very
competitive at 1080p Daddy 400 did run
away with it a bit at 720p though the
frame time performance was much the same
overclocking rise indeed helped push it
ahead of the 8400 and interestingly even
at 1440p it maintained a reasonable
margin the results weren't testing with
f1 2017 was similar though stock the
horizon 5 processor was less competitive
here amazingly the 1% low result was
boosted by 22%
even at 1440p which is incredible and
here the 2600 was still 10% faster than
the 8400 so a mediocre stock result for
the 2600 was saved by an impressive
overclock
result the core i5 8,400 breeze through
the Far Cry 5 benchmark I took the
overclocked Verizon 520 600 to match it
stock horizon wasn't exactly slow but
even at 1440p we do see the core i5 8400
providing up to 21% more performance
which is obviously very significant
Rosen has always had massive performance
issues with the Far Cry primal on well
we see that nothing's changed
overclocking and tweaking the memory
timings did little to improve things as
a result the core i5 8400 enjoys an easy
win even once overclocked to 2600 was
still 8% slowly 8400 1440p when
comparing frame time performance firaon
is a mostly GPU bound title especially
with the hardware configuration that
we're using to test these CPUs and as
such performance at 1440p anton a DP is
much the same for all three
configurations testing at 720p shows the
core i5 8400 to be just 6% faster than
the stock rise in 5 2600 for the frame
time result but 13% faster for the
average frame rate overclocked to 2600
enjoys a 21 percent performance increase
at 720p in this minute was 7 percent
faster than the 8400 for the average
frame rate and 14 percent faster for the
frame time result the rosen 5 and core
i5 processors delivered the exact same
experiences for tonight so it's not
really much to say here solid results
all around but it is worth noting that
it's probably not worth overclocking a
high-end CPU if you only play this title
frost Punk is a brand new game and quite
a few of you have been asking me to
benchmark it so I decided to include it
in this video to benchmark the game I've
built a large city and I'm measuring the
performance with the game speed set to
normal as i zoom in and out and move
around the city again we find that stop
there isin five 2600 limits performance
of the GTX 280 I even at 1440p
though this is rectified once
overclocked still overall the core i5
8400 did deliver better performance
making it a clear winner here moving on
to Grand Theft Auto 5 and he we're
mostly CPU bound and this is evident
when looking at the core i5 8400 which
limited performance to the same frame
rate at all three resolutions then we
see when looking at the Tony P results
at the horizon 4
five processor is 10% slower than the
8400 however overclocking boosted the
average frame rate by 22%
and now the 2600 is 10% faster than the
8400 so overclocking the cause and
tightening up the memory timings helped
the rising tremendously in this title
hitman is yet another heavily CPU bound
title and we see similar performance
trends to that of Grand Theft Auto 5
again the horizon 520 600 lag behind the
8400 out of the box but then once
overclocked did he hit the lead and
produced double-digit gains for the
frame time performance it feels like a
very long time since I last benchmarked
with Just Cause 3 so it was kind of nice
to fire it up once again much like what
I found with battlefield 1 for example
the Rison 5 process are offered
comparable frame time performance out of
the box but was considerably slower for
the average frame rate the core i5 8400
was very solid in this title despite
losing to the overclocked horizon 5 2600
at 1080p and 1440p Kingdom Come
deliverance is a much newer title that I
hadn't really done any benchmarking with
either so I've decided to feature it in
this video again we see that while the
stock rising 5 2600 offered competitive
frame time performance it lagged behind
for the average frame rate that said
overclocking once again rectified that
situation and now the 2600 was able to
match and even beat the 8400 although
Mass Effect Andromeda does utilize the
rise in cpus quite well the core i5 8400
is still able to give AMD a hard time
it's not until we overclocked the 2600
that we see competitive performance at
720p and 1080p of course at 1440p we are
heavily GPU bound so CPU performance at
least with these CPUs is removed from
the equation the core i5 8400 enables
its beast mode once again this time when
testing with overwatch interestingly
while the overclocked horizon 5 2600 was
faster at 720p it did slip behind
slightly at 1440p
still overall once overclocked the 2600
and 84 did deliver similar performance
next up we have prey and this one always
provides interesting results whether
we're comparing am digging nvidia gpus
or AMD and intel cpus here we see that
while the core i5 81
400 is it much slower than the stop 2600
for the average framerate it's up to 25%
slower when comparing the frame time
performance once overclocked the 2,600
streaks head at 720p and 1080p and here
it's almost 50% faster for the 1% low
result okay so when benchmarking with
project cars 2 we see that stock out of
the box the horizon 520 600 is limiting
performance of the GTX 1080i at all 3
resolutions however once overclocked the
gtx 1080i is limiting the performance of
the 2600 and the same is also true for
the 8400 although the stock 2600 is
limiting performance at 1440p it's very
minor and overall performance is much
the same for all three configurations at
this resolution like Far Cry primal pub
G is another title that's always run
noticeably worse on AMD Hardware the
margins aren't a horrible but they're
not really that great either last on my
benchmark was title just after it left
early access the horizon 5 1600 X was 17
percent slower than the core i5 8400
this time the 2600 was 14% slower than
8400 seems little has changed here
overclocked the 2600 didn't really make
up much ground either
and even at 1440p until retain the lead
of course the game is still very
playable on the horizon 520 600 you can
just expect better results with the core
i5 8400 quake champions is another
example where the core i5 8400 provides
strong performance right out of the gate
of course you can't overclock this part
but the evidence would suggest that for
the most part you don't actually need to
the stock 2600 struggles at 720p and
1080p in relation to the core i5 I'm not
saying the frame rates aren't high and
I'm certainly not saying it wasn't
playable but I am saying in relation to
the 8400 it was slower up to 18% slower
in fact in order to match the Intel
process so the horizon 5 2600 needs to
be overclocked and this allows it to
extract a maximum performance from the
gtx 980ti of course once we get to 1440p
all three configurations are able to max
out the gtx 1080i and it's here that
overclocking becomes well somewhat
pointless
next up we have shadow of war and this
title is primarily GPU bound this was
certainly the case at 1080p and 1440p
the
core i5 8400 does edged ahead of the
2600 at 720p but once we overclocked the
2600 it clearly takes the lead Sniper
Elite 4 was tested using the DirectX 12
API and here the core i5 8400 was much
faster on the stoppe 2600 at 720p and
1080p interestingly once we hit 1440p
the stock 2600 pulls ahead I'd say this
is down the fact that we're using a
GeForce graphics card and we're testing
with the DirectX 12 API anyway
regardless of resolution once we
overclocked arisin 5 2600 it is clearly
the fastest sepium provided much greater
frame time performance at 1080p and
1440p Starcraft 2 is another title
that's always heavily requested and it's
actually a game I personally really
enjoy however I often refrain from using
it because although the game itself is
of excellent quality and very popular
the game engine is very dated now and it
makes extremely poor use of modern
hardware for whatever reason it's never
been updated to use more than a single
thread and for this reason Rison has
traditionally struggled in this title
however out of the box the Rison 5 2600
wasn't really that bad and once
overclocked it actually beat the core i5
8400 this three resolution tests with
the geforce gtx 1080i though shows just
how incredibly cpu-bound the game is and
again this is because it uses just a
single core unlike Starcraft 2 the
division isn't limited to a single CPU
core but we are still Hardware limited
this time though GPU limited this is a
very GPU bound title and here we see
that all three test configurations
delivered very similar results even at
720p please note I did go back and
double-check the witcher 3 results
because the frame time performance for
the core i5 8400 looks weaker than
expected the results that are accurate
and it seems a big part of the issue
here for the core i5 processor is the
memory speed switching to a 370 but with
ddr4 3,200 memory boosted frame time
performance by 15% to 93 FPS and while
this still placed 8400 behind the
horizon processor the margin isn't
nearly as extreme I have to say overall
the experience was noticeably smoother
with rising in this title and for those
wondering we always benchmark the
three in the town of novigrad even at
1440p the risin five 2,600 enjoys a
noticeable advantage in this title so
overall a great result for AMD here
titan folds who is a mostly GPU limited
title and low resolution testing can't
be used to get around this as it has a
hard frame cap the 144 FPS limit
neutralizes performance for the most
part at 720p and 1080p and then once we
get to 1440p we're heavily GPU bound so
there isn't much to report here the
stock horizon 520 600 actually
outclassed the core i5 8400 and
vermintide 2 and maintain its
performance advantage even at 1440p at
this resolution overclocking really
proved to be of no benefit but it did
provide up to 13% more performance at
720p as we near the end of this mammoth
benchmarking session we have total war
Warhammer 2 and here we see the stock
rise in 5 2600 trading blows with the
core i5 8400 at 720p and Thierry P by
the time we hit 1440p the game is now
heavily GPU bound so cpu performance
really has no impact here it has to be
said the results are also somewhat GPU
bound at 1080p and therefore we have
another title where these six core CPUs
are really more than sufficient
watchdogs to is a heavily CPU bound game
and here we see the stock r5 2600 and
i-5 8400 delivering basically the same
performance out of the box
ignoring the overclocked 2600 for a
moment it's pretty clear that this game
is CPU bound as both processors provided
basically the same results across all
three resolutions overclock the 2600 is
still the performance limiting component
at 720p and 1080p but is up to 22%
faster than the 8400 even at 1440p the
overclocked Rison 5 processor offered
noteworthy gains the average frame rate
was 21% higher for example the second
last game tested is Tom Clancy's Ghost
Recon wildlands and this is another
primarily GPU bound title though we can
somewhat get around this at 720p still
for the more realistic 1080p and 1440p
resolutions the performance of all three
configurations is much the same finally
we have the World of Tanks results and
here we see the stock horizon 5 2600
trail
the core i5 8400 by a 9% margin that
said once we hit 1440p the game is
severely GPU limited and as a result all
three configurations provided these same
results once overclocked to the r5 2600
match the core i5 at 1080p and beat it
by a 10% margin at 720p alright so those
were some results many bloopers and I
guess now you want to know what it all
means
hmm well where do we even begin I
suppose a look at the average
performance across the 36 games tested
so let's do that first
starting with the 720p results where we
had the least chance of being GPU
limited we see at the core i5 8400 was
an average 13% faster than these stock
rather than 5 2600 that's not a huge
margin but it's certainly noteworthy the
frame time performance was closer but
even here the 8400 was still 10% faster
overclocking did hand rise in the
advantage and now the 2600 was 7% faster
for the 1% low result and just 5% faster
for the average frame rate moving at
iupi we see the margins reduced here and
overclocking only provided a 13%
performance increase and this about the
2600 was 7% fast and 8400 for the 1% low
result and just 3% for the average frame
rate as expected the margins continued
to shrink as the resolution increased
and now 1440p there's very little
difference between the three
configurations for those of you
wondering where the Rison 5 2600 fell
behind 1080p for the 1% low results this
slide should help you out here you can
see that the core i5 8400 was faster out
of the box in 26 of the 36 games tested
while the two CPUs tied in just three
titles the outliers here include prey
and The Witcher 3 where the rise in CPU
was much faster and then Star Wars
Battlefront 2 where it was much slower
then once overclocked this is how the
horizon 5 2600 stacked up here we see
that now it was faster in 28 of the 36
games tested and was overall 7% faster
not a huge difference but the ability to
overclock does make the 2600 the more
powerful CPU for those wondering if we
remove prey and The Witcher 3 which are
massive outliers the risin 5 2600 is now
5% fast
okay so the core i5 8400 was faster in
most of the games out of the box but it
did start to lose once we overclocked
the horizon 526 hundred so which one is
better you asked next question please
seriously though this is a really hard
one to settle but here goes nothing for
those of you gaming exclusively it's
hard to deny that the core i5 8400 isn't
the better option
certainly more cost-effective and
requires far less messing around to
achieve the performance shown in this
video however the reason I often pick
the Rison 5 2600 over the core i5 8400
is because it's just a better
all-rounder at least it is in my opinion
it offers noticeably better performance
in core heavier workloads and for the
most part when gaming performance really
is indistinguishable between these two
CPUs and that is for the simple fact
that you're almost always GPU bound and
we certainly see this when looking at
the 1440p results using the mighty
GeForce GTX 1080 Ti the overclocked
arisin 5 2600 outscores the core i5 by a
60% margin in center bench is 34% faster
in blender and decompresses archives
using 7-zip up to 70% faster but when it
comes to games the core i5 8400 simply
gets it done with less fuss to replicate
the performance in this video you merely
need a basic B 360 board some low
latency ddr4 2666 memory and well a gtx
1080i but you get the point it's also
possible to squeeze another 5 to 10
percent out of the 8400 using a z3 17
motherboard with something like ddr4
3,200 memory though those gains are only
realized with an extreme graphics card
the stock out of the box Rison 5 2600
performance can be achieved for roughly
the same price as the budget Core i5
8400 build and given that the Intel CPU
was overall faster this makes it the
better value choice for gamers at the
very least the overclocked configuration
will require an upgraded cooler but for
the results shown here you'll also need
a high quality motherboard and some
premium Samsung B die memory i priced
all this up in a recent video but what
it means is where you'll be paying about
420 dollars u.s. for the core i5 8400
platform the overclocked Rison 5 build
is
like $500 with a basic air cooler so if
you're strictly gaming the almost 20%
price premium of the overclock risin
five twenty six hundred bills can't
easily be justified given that you stand
to gain just seven percent more
performance on average alternatively you
could spend five hundred dollars us on a
coffee like build and get the eighty six
hundred K with a basic air call or
enable MCA and you've got an unstoppable
gaming rigor of course if you do other
things besides gaming then that price
premium could easily be justified so it
really comes down to the individual and
what your plan on using the system for
personally my preference would actually
be for the horizon five twenty six
hundred as I don't just game on my PC I
also create videos like this one and the
rise in CPU would save me quite a bit of
time encoding each day anyway as I said
it really just comes down to what you
want to do with your PC but the most
important thing is now you should be
armed with all the facts you need to
make an informed purchase so good luck
now that you've got your CPU purchase
dialed in what about your website for
only one solution that allows you to
quickly and easily create a stunning
hassle-free website I recommend checking
out Squarespace unlike building a new PC
which at times can get quite technical
thankfully building a new website
doesn't have to be with Squarespace
there's nothing to install patch or
upgrade ever you don't need to know a
thing about coding either PHP CSS HTML
the oldest acronyms for things you don't
need to worry about if you build with
Squarespace they're beautiful designer
templates make creating a powerful
online identity easy each template is a
starting point for a wide range of
projects whether you're pursuing a side
hustle or promoting your main gig so go
