looking at another monitor from biotech
one of our new favorite display
companies over the last year or so I've
checked out a lot of products from
biotech and I've been consistently
impressed with their value proposition
so I'm hoping today's review of the GFT
27 DB ends up in a similar story so
let's get the basics out of the way the
biotech GFT 27 DB is aiming to be a flat
t inversion of their curved V a GN 27 D
so specs are pretty similar we're
looking at a 27 inch panel 1440p
resolution and 144 Hertz and maximum
refresh rate this monitor supports free
sync with low frame rate compensation
and I can confirm it works perfectly
with both AMD and NVIDIA GPUs with this
new monitor opting for a TN panel
instead of VA gamers are treated to a
flat display which I personally prefer
at this size but there's a few other key
benefits here this is not your standard
crappy entry levels here instead this is
what appears to be a brand-new high-end
TN from AO Optronics it's actually wide
gamut via tech claims 115 percent srgb
which is very rare for a TN plus it's
native 8-bit another rarity for TN
panels the goal here is to mitigate some
of the known color issues with TN
displays while still providing all the
speed benefits such as fast response
times it's an interesting direction to
take TN panels but while it does make
sense because the two technologies known
for their colors which are IPS and VA
are struggling to hit the response times
of a good TN so if you can get a TN to
the same level of colors as an IPS or VA
it brings it back into calculations for
a lot of buyers and I'll talk
extensively about how this power
performs in a moment but before that
let's talk about the vo-tech GF t 27 TB
in particular it comes in at the same
price as the GN 27 D so 330 US dollars
which leaves buyers with a choice
between TN and VA at that price point
the GN 27 D is currently the cheapest
monitor in its class but the GMT 27 DB
isn't quite the cheapest 27 inch 1440p
144 Hertz t
and that crown goes to pick CEO with the
PX 276 however the pick CEO option is
using an older TN that isn't wide gamut
sovietic is essentially offering
potentially better color quality for
about $20 more so that could be quite an
attractive proposition for some people
the design like most of our text
monitors is pretty simple fairly cheap
but minimalist plastic is used for the
main monitor section complete with a
matte display coating that's slightly
grainy but not unusually so for a TN
bezels are slim the three prongs stand
is built from metal and looks pretty
good and aside from a very basic red
light on the back there's not a lot of
gamer style which I very much appreciate
as we thought simple designs there are
some limitations the stand only supports
tilt adjustment if you need height
adjust you'll have to either purchase a
base amount or opt for another monitor
entirely the stand is also quite wobbly
more so than a typical monitor of this
size while the general build quality is
fine if a bit an amazing the stands
instability does make it feel a little
bit cheap that said it's not going to
move around on your desk once you put it
in place especially if you have a sturdy
desk for ports all standard Stucky one
DisplayPort 1.4 and a generous three
HDMI ports including one HDMI 2.0 port
plus an audio output jack there are a
pair of built in to what speakers but
they are well completely rubbish in case
you're wondering seriously they are so
bad I don't know why via Tech included
them the other complaint I have in
regards to the design is via Tex
continual use of four buttons along the
bottom edge to control the on-screen
display rather than a much easier
direction of toggle combined with the
wobble in the stance pretty hard to
navigate the OSD while you find features
like cheat crosshairs picture-in-picture
and color controls and it's worth
mentioning that free sync is disabled by
default in the settings so make sure you
turn that on as for the panel itself
well my main concern going into this
review was viewing angles as it
continues to be the biggest issue for T
and monitors particularly at the higher
end of the TN scale I've got to say this
is one of the better TN displays I've
seen in terms of viewing angles
especially horizontally where there is
some contrast shift but it isn't too bad
however vertically yeah there's still a
significant change in contrast from
viewing it off angles you
we'll still want to be dead on and make
sure you have it tilted correctly to get
the best experience so well it's good
for a TN viewing angles are still
several steps behind a VA and especially
an IPS panel the other area where tiens
tend to suffer is in contrast ratio
though again the GF t 27 DB is on the
upper end of the TN scale here with this
new a Optronics panel native contrast
ratio is a touch under one thousand to
one sitting around the nine seventy to
one mark which is pretty much as good as
it gets for a TN and this is in line
with IPS panels but it does fall well
behind a typical VA where you can expect
more than double the contrast ratio for
something like the GN twenty seventy
brightness though it all checks out in
fact this monitors significantly exceeds
via text claims they list a two hundred
and twenty net peak brightness but in
reality it performs well above that i
recorded a maximum brightness of
slightly under three hundred and fifty
nets which is pretty bright and a good
result for a TN response times they are
clearly the big selling point of TN -
you buy one because you want to be fast
and fast for gaming in particular
biotech claims a one millisecond
response time with overdrive and a three
millisecond standard response which I
have to say holds up pretty well with
what I found during testing the optimal
overdrive setting here is the maximum
high mode which does have a small amount
of overshoot with some transitions but
it was with inner tolerances and
shouldn't matter all that much with this
mode enabled the average grader grade
transition was three point three eight
milliseconds and that's a typically fast
result for a TN putting it well ahead of
VA alternatives with the absolute best
VA sitting above five milliseconds on
average with eight milliseconds a more
realistic figure this TN is noticeably
clearer with less blur and less ghosting
in fast motion scenes the general
behavior of this TN isn't anything
unusual either rise times are much
slower than fall times with an average
rise of 4.91 milliseconds that's
impacted by a relatively slow black to
white transition fall times are
lightning-quick though under two
milliseconds with some transitions
hitting that one millisecond claimed
figure in general the panel is much
faster than the needed six point nine
four milliseconds for refreshing at 144
Hertz so you are getting the
full benefit of the high refresh here
combined with good clarity and those
things aren't necessarily guaranteed if
you go down the VA option input lag is
also very good I recorded around 4
milliseconds of latency which when
combined with the fast transition time
makes the GMT tween 70 be a very fast
monitor you'd expect this from a gaming
focused TN monitor and via tech is
certainly delivered here in terms of
color performance this TN really punches
above its weight in a few areas we're
getting a comfortable 100% srgb coverage
but it's the 92% DCI p3 coverage that
really impressed me that's not quite at
the level I'd expect from a wide gamut
professional monitor but it is a few
percentage points higher than many of
the wider gamut VA panels are tested
recently from Samsung those panels
typically clock in between 85 and 90
percent DCI p3 so for this TN to beat
that is certainly quite impressive as
most hands not wide gamut whatsoever
native 8-bit support is also great to
see considering many TNS and native six
bit and news FRC to achieve full 8-bit
support unfortunately via tech leaves
this wide gamut support unclamped which
means that with that calibration the
display is oversaturated when viewing
srgb content and srgb content is 99
percent of what your view outside of
professional workflows if you love or
don't mind over saturation and extra
vibrant colors well that's great this
panel will look amazing and pretty close
to what you get from a VA but if you're
after accuracy unfortunately out of the
box the gft 27 DB won't deliver what I'd
really like to see what I recommend for
all wide gamut monitors is a simple
switch in the on-screen display the
toggles between an sRGB and a wide gamut
state WyoTech doesn't provide this and
the result is a default saturation Delta
a average of 3.18
along with the colorchecker delta e of
3.43
grayscale results are a little off as
well with my unit having a slight red
tint out of the box along with the Delta
II average of three point six zero
although
gamma is pretty good if you're wondering
about DCI p3 accuracy biotech doesn't
really deliver here with Delta is
between 2.5 and 4.0 for the most part
again it seems
the panel's not really calibrated at all
at the factory which is typical for a
biotech display and many gaming monitors
in general were this for professional
work though I'd definitely be expecting
better results without the ability to
clamp the gamut there's not a whole lot
you can do in the on screen display to
improve performance aside from some
minor tweaks to correct the white point
to get accurate results you really need
to perform a full calibration which as
always I did with the help of my good
friend spectral cows Callum and five
aside from a couple of outliers this
calibration led to good results with
Delta averages below 1.0 however like
with a typical calibration of a TN or
IPS display if contrast ratio did drop
to around nine hundred to one minor drop
but it is worth mentioning nonetheless
patreon members who are interested in
the accurate display profile I created
for this monitor can download it links
to that in the description below lastly
we have uniformity performance he is
decent better than your average of ei
pounds especially those that are curved
but it's not perfect we're looking at
this chart there's basically two blobs
on either side of the panel with a
slight dip in the center and around the
edges unlike a lot of curvy ice though
there's no noticeable vignette effect
which is a good thing overall I think
the GFT 27 DB is a really interesting
product mostly because it's one of those
rare TN panels that has a wide color
gamut that's why I take even says in
their product page tents have this
reputation for poor colors but this 10
in particular is probably the best I've
seen in terms of its color output the
wide gamut does some of the work in its
default state it will be oversaturated
more so than a typical TN and in line
with today's bas which allows for either
92% DCI p3 coverage for those that want
it or vibrant srgb if you're into that
sort of thing but it's the true 8-bit
panel and especially the better than
usual viewing angles that contribute a
lot as well it's in all three of these
areas bit depth viewing angles and gamut
the teams usually fall behind but are
you optronics and biotech have focused a
lot on improving these areas and the
results have really paid off and this is
without impacting response times we just
do as fast as you'd expect for a TN this
panel looks pretty close to a mid tier
IPS if I'm honest it's really
in viewing angles where an IPS pulls
ahead noticeably for a 10 I'm genuinely
very impressed with the image quality
but when you combine the viewing angle
issue with a contrast ratio of under one
thousand to one is still not going to be
getting a VA like experience with those
beautiful deep blacks contrast and
viewing angles are definitely very good
for a TN and I think will be fine for
most people but for those who love V A's
I guess you probably should still be
sticking to UVA the GMT 27 DB also runs
into the standard set of issues with
fire tech monitors the stand has limited
adjustability and is a bit wobbly the
on-screen display is hard to control
it's not calibrated and there's no srgb
mode and it's not available outside of a
small handful of countries well I do
spend a bit of time on calibration in my
reviews most gaming monitors also don't
come calibrated so for me that's
probably the least important issue
I do really wish biotech would expand
into the European and Australian markets
though so would I recommend this monitor
and who would I recommend it to well
it's an easy recommendation for those
that want a fast gaming monitor it's
1440p and 144 Hertz with free sync which
I still feel is the sweet spot for PC
gaming in 2019 and because it's a TN
ghosting really isn't an issue
combined with the best colors I've seen
for this type of monitor it's basically
the best gaming TN on the market right
now so kudos to biotech for that despite
being a unique monitor in that no other
company is using this panel yet os as
far as I can tell I don't feel it's
overpriced either at $330 it's the same
price as via text equivalent curved VA
with both the VA and TN each having
strengths and weaknesses the VA still
has superior colors in my opinion but
the TN is flat and is faster both a
fantastic value though so which option
is better really depends on what you
want out of a display just don't
immediately dismiss the GF 227 DB
because it's a TN it's definitely a lot
better than most TN displays of the past
