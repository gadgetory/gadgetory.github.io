bossed today I've got something a little
different for you it's a fun build
around the GTX 1080 using some extremely
cool hardware in the supporting cast now
this video was supposed to be ready to
go out with my original 1080 content but
I've been absolutely snowed in so it's a
little late to the party
sorry now on to these awesome components
that we'll be going into the build the
backbone of the build is this awesome
little micro ATX motherboard from
Nazareth the Zed 170 OC formula this is
an amazing board and one that's really
popular with serious overclock is not to
mention it looks cool this would
obviously look unreal in a bumblebee
black and yellow theme build you can
grab this board for $200 in the USA or
around 390 dollars from online retailers
in Australia obviously this isn't the
most affordable z170 motherboard getting
around but for unrivaled overclocking
performance this is the board to get
I've been running it with some of the G
skills ddr4 4266 memory without any
issues
for this build block though I use
slightly less extreme memory I selected
a to stick 16 gigabyte kit of HyperX
savage ddr4 with the black heatsinks
which I have to say looks pretty badass
on this motherboard to cooling the CPU
is the silverstone tundra series t do
tooi liquid cooler which does a great
job of keeping temps under control in
australia you can pick this one up for
about 120 dollars and it's about $90 in
USA so pretty great value here powering
this build is silverstone strider
titanium series sta TFT i which is an
800 watt PS user will have plenty of
power to spare running this build this
thing is a d-plus titanium rated and you
can get it for two hundred fifty-five
dollars down under or for a hundred and
seventy freedom dollars in the US for
our storage drive I've selected the high
performance Western Digital black six
terabyte hard drive which you can pick
up for four hundred and thirty dollars
in Australia or just under three hundred
dollars in the USA for our operating
system drive we have a crucial SSD
installed
lastly housing all of this epic hardware
is the beautiful land Lee PCO eight full
ATX case in the black colorway this is a
pretty cool and unique looking case with
classy glass panels it also comes with
some good quality RGB light strips that
you can
if you want to the price reflects its
quality and for the privilege of putting
your hardware inside it'll cost you
around 500 Australian dollars or 360 US
dollars that about wraps up everything
going to the system now sit back and
enjoy the build
thanks for watching my first 1080 build
video I think it's a pretty cool looking
system I know the parts are a bit random
and you could certainly get the same
performance from a less expensive system
but I had these cool bits and pieces
laying around and was dying to do a 1080
build I reckon it looked best with the
RGB set to purple but it would have been
nice if I could have made the whole
build black purple and yellow themed to
see exactly what kind of gaming
performance you can expect from this
beast please check out my GD X 1080
review and GD X 1080 overclocking videos
these two links what do you guys think
of this Lian Li case what color would
you be setting the RGB is to let me know
