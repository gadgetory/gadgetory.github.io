time to benchmark another one of
invidious new laptop RTX graphics cuts
the GeForce r-tx 2016 given the high
popularity and widespread use of the gtx
1060 in gaming laptops the RT x 2060 is
said to be one of the key offerings in
invidious latest lineup and judging by
our comments section it definitely seems
like it's one that you guys are most
interested in it's in my previous review
of the RT x 2070 max-q i spent a lot of
time talking about how invidious naming
scheme for their laptop GPUs pretty much
sucks and is misleading for potential
buyers that's still the case with the RT
X 2060 but I'm not going to spend as
much time on this issue if you're
interested in my in-depth thoughts on it
check the previous review so the RT x
2064 laptops uses the same tu 106 GPU as
the desktop card with the same core
configuration so we're getting 1920 cuda
cores 240 10 circles and 30 ray tracing
cause it also has the same memory
configuration so 6 gigabytes of gddr5 10
gigabits per second on a 192 bit bus for
336 gigabytes per second of bandwidth
it's still built on TSM sares12
nanometer process as well however the
laptop RT x 360 isn't clocked anywhere
near what the desktop card can achieve
the desktop card has a base clock of
1365 megahertz and a boost of 1680
megahertz with GPU boost taking the GPU
even higher the laptop variant is
clocked at just 960 mega Hertz base with
a boost of 1200 megahertz so the boost
clock is even lower than the desktop
cards base clock Nvidia did this to
shave the TDP down from 160 watts to 80
to 90 watts which is more suitable for
laptop designs and this is where buyers
can get a bit misled you simply won't
get our TX 2060 performance from the
laptop very despite both having the same
name truing laptop GPU is also more
aggressively undercooked relative to the
desktop cards than pascal ever was so
I'm not expecting to see the same
margins or performance improvements
on the desktop I would prefer if this
GPU is instead called the r-tx 26 TM but
enough on that let's move on for the
upcoming blue benchmarks I've used the
brand new asus rog strict sky 2 GL 5 or
4 GV that name is a bit of a mouthful
but essentially this is a typical
15-inch gaming notebook it's not a slim
and light machine like this so Sepphoris
it's just a regular design that's 25
millimeters thick and about 2.4
kilograms heavy there's no max QR TX
2060 so this GPU is suited to these
sorts of thicker designs the CPU here is
Intel 6 core Core i7
8750 H the go-to offering for gaming
laptops these days the same CPU is used
for our Pascal laptops and other
architects laptops we've tested so far
so we really are looking at just the
differences in GPU performance today
this laptop came with 16 gigabytes of
RAM in a single channel configuration
but for testing I swap that out for 32
gigabytes in dual channel to keep it
apples to apples with other laptops in
our database I also use the laptops
balanced fan mode because in gaming I
found no difference in performance
between ears and the louder turbo mode
finally I've done all testing at 1080p
the standard resolution for gaming
laptop displays with this unit packing a
144 Hertz panel so we're going to kick
this one off with a look at battlefield
one it's not the most recent battlefield
title but it's one that plays well on
laptops the ITX 360 he manages to
squeeze marginally ahead of the gtx 1070
max q providing over 100 FPS on average
with a similar one percent low to the
gtx 1070 max q it's also 28% faster than
the gtx 1066 gigabyte in this title
however it can't quite match the gtx
1070 falling 10% behind the older Pascal
GPU
now if you've been following our desktop
coverage of the our tech series these
results might seem a little strange on
the desktop side the ITX 2060 is more
than 50% faster than the gtx 1060 in
this title and more than 10% faster than
the gtx 1070 however on the laptop side
the margins are much smaller and the
comparisons are very different with the
nutrient GPU failing to Beit the gtx
1070 this is again why i feel the naming
is a bit misleading if any buyers have
seen our TX 2060 desktop coverage they
might believe then
you r-tx 2016 laptop will outperform an
older gtx 1070 model but that's really
not the case why the ITX 2060 easily
clocks above 1800 megahertz on the
desktop in our soos laptop it sits
around 1450 megahertz
hence the large performance discrepancy
meanwhile our laptop gtx 1070 clocks at
1800 megahertz compared to slightly over
1900 megahertz on the desktop pascal
laptop GPU simply clocked a lot higher
and closer to their desktop counterparts
than these nuturing gps do that's not to
say performance is overall bad here
we're looking at Wolfenstein 2 which is
very favorable to invidious current GPU
architecture the ITX 2060 comes in 34
percent ahead of the GTX 1060 although
it still gets beaten badly by the GTX
1017 watchdogs 2 is one of those games
that tends to be more CPU constrained in
a laptop although we're still seeing a
handy 25 percent performance uplift in
this older Ubisoft title with that said
this is one of the few games I tested
where the r-tx 2060 performed below the
gtx 1070 max q in far cry 5 again we're
looking at a 25% performance improvement
over the gtx 1060 however this time it
doesn't lose his barely 2 other GPUs
outperforming the GTX 970 max Q by 6
percent and only slotting in 3% behind
the RT X 2070 max Q with the RT x 2060
consistently delivering above 60 FPS
ultra settings here this is a handy
improvement over the gtx 1060 Resident
Evil 2 is one of the newest games in our
test suite using the ballast quality
preset which is nearly visually
identical to the maximum preset laptops
in general performed really well
achieving over 100 FPS for the most part
the RT X 2060 is 35% faster than the GTX
1060 only 7% slower than the GTX 1070
and a decent 11% faster than the gtx
1070 max q hitman 2 is a punishing title
for CPU constraint hardware but current
generation laptops are still capable of
a 60 FPS experience at 1080p using
maximum quality settings the ITX 2060 is
just 23% faster than the gtx 1060 here
but other margins that in line with what
we've previously seen
impressively the artex 2060 is 4% faster
than the RT x 2070 max
in this title dirt foresees the art x26
t hold a 37% performance advantage over
the GTX 1060 while still coming in 12%
behind the GTX 1070 and 10% behind the
newer RT X 2070 max Q even with eight
times msaa in this game at 1080p is
still in for a rock solid experience
probably time to throw an older title
into the mix how about Deus Ex mankind
divided this game has one of the
smallest margins between the r-tx 2060
and the gtx 1070 with the 2060 only 7%
behind it's also 8% faster than the gtx
1070 max-q
and 36% ahead of the gtx 1066 gigabyte
you're probably wondering about
battlefield 5 performance as well here
the new RT x 2060 is only 23 percent
faster than the gtx 1060 however other
margins that in line with what we've
seen previously at 1080p paid with a
high refresh laptop display the ITX 2060
is very capable and delivers a great
experience rounding this performance
comparison out with a tenth title I've
settled on 'pray this represents a game
that really doesn't benefit all that
much from the faster GPU it's only 13%
faster than the GTX 960 here 7% slower
than the gtx 1070 and 7% faster than the
gtx 1070 max-q
i'm guessing you probably want to see
some more graphs assassin's creed
Odyssey is one of the hardest games to
get running smoothly on a laptop I think
it's down to the CPU and for some reason
gigabytes error laptops get destroyed in
this title that said with the very high
preset you're looking at a 60 FPS
average at 1080p with the RT X 2016 this
is the final comparison here we have
Middle Earth shadow of Wharf the art X
2060 is 32% faster than the GTX 1060 10%
slower than the gtx 1070 and 9% behind
at the RT X 2017 max Q I'm guessing you
want some performance summary see I
actually benchmarked a total of 20 games
on this GPU and refresh the data for a
number of other GPS just for this
comparison so this is probably the best
look at performance yet the big one here
is the RT X 2060 vs. the GTX 1060 well
probably not the best comparison in
terms of laptop pricing which I'll talk
about in a moment the RT X 2060 is a
good 28 percent faster than the GT
66 gigabyte on average that's a much
better margin than I was expecting off
the ITX 2070 max-q review which only
clocked in around 10% faster than its
direct naming predecessor the gtx 1070
max-q speaking of the gtx 1070 max-q the
r-tx 2060 is also faster than that GPU
to the tune of a 6% average it's not
faster in every title but it's only in
older games right appears to struggle
anything recent and the ITX 2060 pulls
away to my surprise the artex 2060 isn't
much slower than the r-tx 2017 max-q on
average we're talking four percent
slower on average with some games
clocking in faster than was supposed to
be a higher tier GPU this could place
prospective r-tx 2017 max-q buyers in an
awkward position with the cheaper option
providing almost as good performance
where the comparison isn't as favorable
is when comparing the r-tx 2060 to the
gtx 1070 the art text when 60 is 11%
slower on average losing in every single
game by between 2% and 20% and this is
where we start to see the weaknesses of
invidious r-tx laptop lineup once again
with desktop GPUs the r-tx 2060 is on
average 53% faster than the GTX 1066
gigabyte here with laptop GPUs is only
28% faster and this also means that
rather than being more than 10 percent
faster than a gtx 1070 it's 11% slower
not a good situation for those who might
accidentally use desktop data for their
laptop buying decision it does seem that
within a generation though the
comparisons make sense the GTX 1017
laptops is about 40 percent faster than
a laptop GTX 1060 which is similar to
the desktop margin the ITX 2060 is 4
percent slower than the r-tx 2070 max QM
while we haven't tested the full laptop
RTX 2070 yet with desktop cards the 2060
is 11% slower than the 2070 on average
so the margins we've seen so far also
seem to make sense there if you're
looking for a direct desktop comparison
to the r-tx Android 60 it's hard to give
a specific one but so far it looks to be
between the GTX 1660 Ti and the GTX 1060
I did cop a bit of flat for making these
lat
Desktop comparisons in the last video
but again the r-tx twist 60 laptop and
desktop GPUs will have the same name and
with the Pascal card like the gtx 1070
laptop performance was only slightly
behind desktop performance but here the
margins are much more significant so why
talk about all these laptop desktop
comparisons and why are they relevant
well that's down to typical laptop price
in videos RTX locked our pricing is more
in line with the desktop products than
what makes sense for laptops given their
performance with the ITX 2060 we're
looking at a typical price for a chorus
of an 80 758 system of around 1800 US
dollars for much of the GTX 260 s life
you could find a typical laptop for
around the $1,300 mark so that's a 38%
increase in price for 28% more
performance on the desktop side though
the RT X 2060 at 350 dollars came in
around 40% more expensive than the gtx
1066 gigabyte and $250 so the margins
are similar but the desktop RT external
60 is more than 50 percent faster than a
1066 gigabyte making it good value with
laptops you're not getting the same
margins so value is much worse and
that's only talking about typical mid
generation gtx 1060 laptop pricing today
gtx 1060 laptops are easily available
for less than 1100 us so you're facing
spending $700 more for an equivalent
r-tx 2060 machine which is a serious
price jump it doesn't get much better
comparing the ITX 2060 to the gtx 1070
on the desktop this actually made sense
both GPUs were about the same price the
are checks between 60 is a decent amount
faster so it ended up better value and
therefore the better Buy in that price
tier with laptops it's not quite the
same again here we see the ITX 2060
laptops coming in around the typical
price for a gtx 1070 system
$1,800 u.s. but the value simply isn't
there because the laptop r-tx 2016 is 11
percent slower and with today's prices
often sitting at $1500 or less for a gtx
1070 laptop it really is a no-brainer to
choose the older pascal option it's hard
to say what will happen when it GT x10
semi laptops leave the market
especially as a lot of models are
currently on an end-of-life fire sale
but right now we're facing a situation
where you'll have to spend as much as a
typical gtx 1070 laptop last year while
receiving less performance and that's a
pretty terrible situation to be in
the pricing situation also throws into
question the r-tx 2070 max-q typical
laptops with that GPU around 2400 US
dollars which is 33% more than our Tex
2060 laptops for only a four percent
performance uplift sure you get the
added portability but geez that is a lot
to pay for it with that said this hasn't
really changed compared to Pascal models
where the gtx 1070 laptops were
considerably cheaper than slower gtex
1070 max2 units for the most part
there's really no other way to put it
this laptop GPU is disappointing it does
present a performance gain over the gtx
1060 but it's not priced in the same
product category it's slower than gtx
1070 laptops which launched at the same
price and am now cheaper so i'm really
gobsmacked in this situation given the
Artic story 60 is actually a good buy
for desktop owners right now I honestly
could not recommend an RT ex 2060 laptop
over a gtx 1070 option and I'm
definitely concerned about that pricing
being around the same for less
performance for your laptops moving
forward for RTX 2060 laptops to be worth
buying they need to be priced around
1400 US dollars and that's a $400 price
cut which seems like a tough ask and yes
you can get in our text we're 60 laptop
for 1400 right now but it only has a
quad core Core i5 8300 8 CPU inside not
the standard 6 core 8750 eights
it is a better deal but it's not an
equivalent comparison and I still
wouldn't buy it over $1500 gtx 1070
system so those are my thoughts on the
r-tx 2064 laptops are highly
disappointing product right now
certainly one that doesn't live up to
the expectations set by the generally
quiet good desktop card
