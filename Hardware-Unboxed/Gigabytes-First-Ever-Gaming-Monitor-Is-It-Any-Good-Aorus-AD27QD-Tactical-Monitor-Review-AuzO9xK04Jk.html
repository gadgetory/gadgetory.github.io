taking a look at gigabytes first ever
monitor the horas ad 27 QD tactical
monitor you have tactical modeler
gigabyte makes a big deal about this
being the world's first tactical monitor
on their website which seems to be a
case of gigabyte just inventing a
product category out of thin air to
claim being the first is something bit
strange but anyway that really has
nothing to do whether this monitor is
any good in terms of specifications
we're looking at a 27-inch 1440p flat
IPS panel with a maximum refresh rate of
144 Hertz and freesync support its NIT
you can now use these sorts of monitors
with NVIDIA GPUs as well so there's no
need for gigabyte to make a qi sync
equivalent also because this is a 144
Hertz monitor it supports low framerate
compensation for adaptive sync support
from one Hertz all the way up to 144
Hertz gigabyte it's also advertising HDR
support with display HDR 400
certification for what it's worth this
isn't the first monitor to use this
gaming grade IPS panel in conjunction
with HDR be gigabyte are attempting to
differentiate it from the pack with
tactical branding and a massive amount
of additional features and 599 US
dollars it's at the higher end of the
price bracket for these sorts of
displays but I suspect gigabyte are
hoping their feature set will get the
nod over cheaper alternatives we'll see
about that a bit later I'm always
interested to see what companies do with
their first entry into the gaming
monitor market because it's not always
as simple as picking a display module
off the shelf building a housing and
calling it a day but in the case of the
Auris ad 27 QD it seems the Gigabyte
have put a lot of time into researching
what other brands are doing with their
products to ensure that a gigabytes
first product is ticking all the boxes
the design for example is pretty
impressive gigabyte has gone down the
path of a more gamer style design which
I'm personally not a huge fan of it
looks similar to recent a seuss ROG and
ASA predator monitors but it's
undoubtedly a quality construction the
stand is solid metal for the most part
and while the plastic on the rear is
unspectacular everything is well put
together without
she seems like you can find with more
budget and displays right out of the
gate gigabytes monitor build quality is
at least as good as the other major
players which surprised me somewhat most
of the game elements are hidden around
the back with angled plastic a large
vented section at the top and plenty of
RGB lighting that syncs up with
gigabytes fusions software you get RGB
LEDs on the back of the monitor plus the
back and sides of the stand all
customizable the stand is also very
adjustable supporting tilt pivot swivel
and height adjustments which you'd
expect from a premium class product
inputs as well all very standard stuff
with a single DisplayPort input and two
HDMI 2.0 ports plus a two port USB hub
and some audio jacks before getting into
the performance numbers I did want to
spend a bit of time on the software
because what gigabyte has achieved here
is pretty impressive
normally newer OMS just come out with a
basic selection of features that they
build on over time big gigabyte has gone
all out with the ad 27 QD this
morning--i boasts a feature set that's
not only the equal of companies like a
soos and Acer but it's even better in
many regards the many monitor features
are accessible either through the
on-screen display controlled through a
directional toggle blow the Auris logo
or via a Windows software utility called
OSD sidekick you get control of
basically every feature so that's the
color controls cheap features and more a
lot of these features aren't unique to
the ad 27 QD things like the aim
stabilizer is just a different brand
name for backlight strobing blur
reduction which allows the monitor to
hit its one millisecond MP RT response
time spec others like picture-in-picture
low blue light and so on we've all seen
before but there are some unique things
in here that I wanted to draw attention
to firstly there are more cheap features
here than I have seen before
gigabyte calls these tactical features
or game assets but really they're just
ways to add things into a game without
triggering cheat detection the crosshair
is a primary example of that in
gigabytes crosshair feature is the most
comprehensive I've seen because it
allows you to draw your own crosshair
and have that overlaid this could give
you an advantage in games that don't
have a crosshair and don't allow on via
cheat software you also get features
like a black equalizer to boost shadows
timers counters and more on top of this
gigabyte has a
- bored you can enable that overlays PC
statistics like CPU and GPU usage
temperatures and clock speeds I couldn't
get this feature to work and I don't
think it would be superior to an
afterburner overlay for example but it
could come in handy again if software
overlays are banned or detected as chief
software the final feature worth
mentioning is something relatively
unique I can't recall any other monitor
that includes it and that's active
microphone noise cancellation basically
when you plug in a microphone to the
monitor you can use the monitors
built-in microphones to provide active
noise cancellation of noises in your
gaming environment this allows your
voice to be sent through clearly while
your keyboard sounds can be canceled out
for example it's pretty neat stuff and
it works quite well if your headset
doesn't already have noise cancellation
so the ad 27 QD has an impressive array
of features in the on-screen display now
it's time to see how the display itself
performs we're looking at a 27-inch
1440p 144 Hertz IPS panel here these
specs are also available in TN and VA
panels but the VA selection right now is
entirely curved so if you want good
color reproduction and a flat display
this IPS is for you while those after
deeper blacks will need to go with a
curved panel unfortunately IPS is
typically a faster display technology
than VA but this isn't really the case
with the gigabyte or as a d-27 QD with
an average grader great response time of
8.4 one milliseconds this puts the
monitor right among the pack of gaming
great VA panels that typically have a 7
to 9 millisecond response time this is
using the default balanced overdrive
mode as the faster speed mode introduces
upwards of 20% overshoot for some
transitions looking at the difference in
transition times between the bounced and
speed modes I'd say that gigabyte
probably could have optimized things a
bit further here the speed mode is much
faster than the bounce mode cutting some
transition times in half or better but
due to the overshoot we can't recommend
using it I feel what is required here is
a mode between balanced and speed that
pushes closer to overshooting without
doing so and I suspect if that mode
existed we would get transition times
down around that 16 millisecond mark
which is more in line with high-end IPS
displays and getting down to 6
milliseconds is important for a 144
Hertz despise the refresh rate when
dough is 6.9 four milliseconds the ad 27
QD can only achieve transitions faster
than this with its speed mode that
induces overshoot while the bounced mode
is too slow and delivers an experience
more like a 120 Hertz display so this is
a disappointing result 4 gigabytes first
displayed though as it's one of the
trickier performance metrics to get
right I'm hoping this is something
gigabytes engineering team is working on
for future models in terms of input lag
again still working on updating our test
results with version 2.0 of our input
lag test however I can say the ad 27 QT
is one of the fastest displays I've
tested in terms of latency coming in at
around four point seven milliseconds so
it's good to verify gigabyte is using
fast gaming great display processing
Hardware here looking at brightness and
contrast nothing out of the ordinary for
an IPS display in fact it's tending
towards an above average experience
brightness peaked at 448 nits above
gigabytes claims while the default
contrast is around 1150 to 1 this
contrast ratio is well below what you
get with a VA panel but again there are
no flat VA panels with these
specifications and IPS panels have
superior viewing angles for what it's
worth
color performance is an interesting
situation with the ad 27 QD gigabyte has
done a lot of things right here but
still has a long way to go to make this
display perfect so this is a wide gamut
monitor gigabyte advertisers 95% DCI p3
coverage and 10 bit of color processing
through an 8-bit plus FRC panel and when
looking at default DCI p3 accuracy it's
pretty decent we're getting a good CCT
curve and average with good Gama and an
acceptable though not fantastic
grayscale Delta a average of around 2.5
0 however both saturation and color
checker tests produced a delta e average
below 2.0 which is very good it's not
elite T accuracy but for a gaming
monitor this is well above average
especially considering it's a wide gamut
we're looking at however things start to
fall away when examining srgb accuracy
and that's because there is no display
mode that clamps this monitor to an sRGB
gamut there is an sRGB mode in the
settings but because it doesn't limit
the gamut to srgb instead leaves it in
an unclamped DCI p3 state it's
completely useless effectively so when
measuring default srgb performance were
left with Delta
above three-pointer across many of our
tests this isn't nearly as good as its
DCI p3 performance and you can quite
clearly see in the saturation chart that
srgb colors are being stretched out to
DCI p3 leading to over saturation
there's no good way to solve this
problem for those that want color
accuracy across the vast majority of
Windows applications that use the sRGB
color space what's missing is a simple
switch in the on-screen display that
allows you to set the gamma to srgb and
still allows control over brightness and
color temperature you can nail down the
color temperature using the OSD as it is
but that only improves accuracy slightly
I did manage to find one sort of hack
that limits the despite srgb Boots not a
very good one basically if you enable
the windows HDR mode and use SDR apps it
will be limited to srgb but only if you
set some specific OSD settings and then
you may run into a variety of issues
when using the HDR mode for SDR apps the
mode has come a long way but I'd still
recommend you leave it disabled for SDR
usage in most cases the only proper way
to solved the unclamped gamut is to use
a software profile I created one using
spectral cows cow man 5 that was very
accurate producing average Delta is
below 1.0 along with a tight grayscale
curve crucially this sort of calibration
came only at a slight loss to contrast
ratio now sitting at eleven hundred to
one which is still very good for an IPS
panel members of our patreon can
download the software profile we created
for this monitor links in the
description panel uniformity is close to
being decent but stumbles at the last
hurdle Center uniformity is quite decent
almost the entire center area and along
the bottom edge deviates from the center
by less than 2.5 however it's the outer
edges that suffer especially the top
corners this wouldn't be good enough for
a professional-grade display but I'd say
it's an average result for a gaming
monitor the final aspect of performance
I wanted to discuss is HDR this is a
display hgr 400 certified panel so
needless to say
HDR performance won't be very good as
I've mentioned in previous reviews there
are three key pillars to HDR performance
brightness contrast and color gamut the
gigabyte ad 27 QD only provides a better
than SDR experience in one of those
areas and that's : gamut thanks to US 95
% DCI p3 coverage brightness falls short
at a peak of only 400 nits and that's
exacerbated by a contrast ratio that's
far too low for HDR at just 1100 to 1
there's no local dimming here and not
even a dynamic backlight which means
that for a lot of content you won't even
get an 1100 to 1 contrast ratio for
example to get a peak brightness of 400
nits you have to turn up the brightness
to the maximum but that means if the
displays asked to show our modest 200
nits the contrast ratio is reduced to
around 500 to 1 which is nowhere near an
HDR experience the panel is actually
quite accurate at showing nits levels
it's capable for example when content
targets 116 it's the panel produces 165
nits but this doesn't matter much when
peak brightness is low and contrast
isn't good enough
Judah failing a number of metrics in my
age to our checklist and say this
display isn't even semi HDR capable it's
just flat-out not an HDR display it's a
very good wide gamut display but it's
simply not an HDR display so that's all
the performance tyne have done let's
talk about my overall thoughts at $600
this is a high-end monitor in its
specification class with models like the
pic Co px 2 7 7 H offering similar specs
in the budget class for just 420 dollars
a soos also offers a similar display the
mg 27 9q for five hundred and fifty
dollars so gigabyte need to be providing
a lot of extra value than either of
those two options to justify the higher
priced at I think gigabyte has made a
good attempt at adding this value the ad
27 QD well it's a wider gamut display
than either of the monitors I just
mentioned and it does so with accurate
DCI p3 coverage out of the box if you
want a gaming display there's also wide
gamut the ad 207 QD would be right at
the top of my list it also supports a
slightly wider gamut than similar VA
offerings and it's not curved which is a
good thing in my eyes however there are
some issues with clamping this display -
srgb
it's doable with the software profile
but I'd have liked to see a mode in the
OSD that takes care of it
response times also week for an IPS
panel if you are buying this monitor
because it's faster than VI options I'd
probably think again
luckily input lag is excellent and while
the HDR mode is poor you won't
comparing panel that offers decent hga
anyway so it's a bit of a moot point
gigabyte has also done a decent job of
adding value through this displays
functionality in particularly the active
noise cancellation and some of the
unique shape features for a first-time
product the software suite is impressive
as is the build quality which is right
up there with other high-end monitors
this definitely doesn't have a budget
feel to it when it comes to recommending
this monitor there are a few things I'd
consider though if you just want a
budget 27-inch 1440p high refresh
monitor for gaming I'd go down one of
two paths either get a $300 curve VA
like the Samsung JG 50 or opt for the
flat IPS pick 0px 277 H if you're just
after decent specs and a good gaming
experience I think those monitors offer
better value than the much more
expensive gigabyte ad 27 QD but if
you're specifically after a wide gamut
monitor or interested in some of the
unique features this monitor provides I
think there is some merit in spending
$600 on the gigabyte ad 27 QD at this
price it definitely won't be for
everyone but there's enough good stuff
here that for some buyers it might be
the right fit depending on what you want
while it is potentially a good buy for
some I think overall it's about $100 too
expensive to get a more broad
recommendation $500 would be a really
good price for this display and $450
would be an instant recommendation that
said I do want to commend gigabyte for a
strong showing with their first monitor
there are still some things to be worked
on but this is a much better product
than I expected from a first generation
product line I'll be very interested to
see where gigabytes monitor division
goes in the future that's it for this
