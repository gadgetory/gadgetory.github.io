got to be sleek stylish above all else
then take my shiny new Samsung Galaxy s8
plus for example it's so sleek and thin
it goes beyond the realms of being
remotely practical drop it once from any
height greater than its own length and
you're probably going to have a bad day
thankfully MSI is unbelievably slim and
thankfully still very stylish GS 63 VR
7rf stealth pro is much easier to live
with as long as you're creative enough
to come up with a more appropriate name
if you are unimpressed with the beefcake
that is gigabytes arrow 15 I mean that
thing measures 19 point 9 millimeters
thick what they think the average game
is built like a rock well thankfully MSI
has come to the rescue with their GS 60
let's just call it the stealth pro
anyway the stealth pro measures just 17
point 7 millimeters thick and that's 11%
thinner than gigabytes ultra portable
gaming laptop that Tim was mighty
impressed with so whatever so I managed
to cram into this 1.8 kilogram pancake
of a laptop and perhaps more importantly
just how have they done it well let's go
find out inside they've managed to
include a geforce gtx 1060 with all six
gigabytes of vram to memory dims
populated with ddr4 or 2,400 memory a
7th generation Intel Core i7 processor
an m2 SSD and room for a 2.5 inch drive
as well
the only real sacrifice as far as I can
tell has been made to the battery which
is a 3-cell 57 watt our job so I don't
expect it will last too long when I'm
plugged from the external 180 watt power
brick it's also well worth noting this
is the lightest 15-inch laptop on the
market to feature the geforce gtx 1060
so that's quite an impressive
achievement by msi skirting the exterior
you will find a plethora of connectivity
on the left there's an Ethernet port
which MSI's managed to cram in along
with an SD card slot three USB 3.0 ports
and two 3.5 millimeter audio jacks on
the right is a single USB 2.0 port
Thunderbolt 3 via USB type-c HDMI 2.0
mini DisplayPort
and a proprietary power connector the
amount of USB ports on this laptop is
fantastic although the position of the
power connector and display outputs may
inhibit Mouse usage in some
circumstances I should also note that
the ports on the left and right edges
are also quite close to the front this
is in order to accommodate the massive
internal cooling solution which I'll
cover in a moment something worth noting
is the fact that the stealth pro can
support up to three external displays
each at a resolution up to 4k in fact
it's possible to run up to 4 display
simultaneously as you can still use the
laptops own display with 3 monitors
connected msi calls this their matrix
display and they say it makes for mega
multitasking support even during
competitive gameplay this makes the
stealth pro extremely powerful when it
comes to display options moving on
around the stealth pro we find a mostly
black design that's complemented by a
small handful of red highlights
including a red rim around the trackpad
several red lines near the exhaust vents
the MSI gaming logo on the lid and the
well hidden power status LED above the
keyboard the subtle highlight approach
works well and it fits in with MSI
stealth branding what I really
appreciate about this laptop is that the
most interesting elements are more
functional than aesthetic for example
the display hinge folds back more than
180 degrees which is more than most
traditional laptops I'm not sure why you
need or want to use the stealth pro with
the display parallels your desk but
nonetheless it's an option the overall
style of this laptop is similar to MSI's
other offerings with generous use of
brushed magnesium alloy around the
keyboard area and the top side of the
lid the smooth black finish is a
definite fingerprint magnet though
although visually the design is
excellent and it certainly appears very
sleek and stylish as I mentioned earlier
there's essentially no gamer elements to
be found making this the perfect work
slash play laptop I should note that in
order to unlock the full power of the
gtx 1060 you'll need to carry around the
rather large power brick the brick is
almost twice as thick as the laptop
itself and way they're hefty 580 grams
which needs to be factored into the
portability calculations of course the
laptop does work without this power
brick although the 65 watt hour internal
battery won't let you get away from the
mains power for too long and as is
always the case with laptops graphics
performance is the
frequently reduced when on battery power
underneath the stealth Pro we find yet
another interesting inclusion felt the
bottom of the laptop is covered in this
soft material except for where the
intake vents are naturally you don't
want to block those with any kind of
material the felt also provides some
insulation and it does prevent the GPU
from simply channeling all of its heat
through the metal body onto your legs I
really do like this edition and for me
it provides a very premium look and feel
opening up the laptop lid we find an
impressive looking 15.6 inch IPS display
supporting a resolution of 1920 by 1080
and this provides a pixel density of 141
pixels per inch this resolution is
typical for a gaming laptop of this size
and well suited to the performance of
the GTX 1060 there is also a 4k IPS
option available though you can of
course expect to pay quite a bit more
extra for that one lastly though it was
a little disappointing to discover this
premium laptop lacked g-sync or a
refresh rate higher than 60 Hertz
complementing the sharp looking displays
a steelseries keyboard using chiclet
keys which are fine for gaming and the
tactile feel of each key is surprisingly
clicky considering the use of rubber
dome key caps the keyboard layout is
very good with adequate size for
important gaming keys like tab left
shift control + spacebar there are
full-sized arrow keys awkwardly crouched
between the standard keyboard and the
numpad though I do appreciate the
inclusion of a numpad on a laptop that
clearly has enough room to include one
system functions such as volume
adjustment brightness adjustment
aeroplane mode and so forth are mapped
to both the F keys and arrow keys and is
a good mix of inclusion see the keyboard
is backlit via three zones of RGB LEDs
in MSI's utility you can change the
color of each of the three zones and
there are additional functions to pulse
the backlight in various patterns the
rainbow effect looks pretty cool though
it should be noted that each individual
key is not RGB programmable if you
prefer a solid backlit color red looks
best as it matches the physical red
highlights of the laptop so we know the
stealth pro is super thin and we know
that it had some seriously impressive
hardware inside so how does it go about
keeping everything cool and hopefully
clear of any throttling issues
well let's crack it open and take a look
getting inside is relatively easy there
are just a little over a dozen small
that need to be removed from the bottom
cover and then the back just pops out of
place inside we find an easy to replace
2.5 inch drive and a slimline battery
but beyond that there isn't much else to
see the internals are mostly facing
upwards which means replacing the SSD
and ddr4 memory is extremely difficult
which is a bit frustrating to be honest
the only part of the cooling that's
visible here are the three red blower
fans which look cool but don't give too
much away in order to get to the cooling
as well as the SSD and memory you need
to completely remove the motherboard
which is a bit extreme and not something
your average laptop owner is going to
want to do not to mention you are
voiding your warranty by removing the
cover to begin with once pulled apart I
found what MSI called a trinity cooler
this design employs three fans two of
which are larger fans featuring 41
blades while there is a smaller 37 blade
fan the GPU is cooled by 41 and 37 blade
fan while the other 41 blade fan takes
care of the CPU MSI claims that these
fans features a unique whirlwind blade
design which increases air pressure by
up to 30 percent basically this boils
down to more generic blower type fans
featuring fewer fins but with thicker
blades
whereas MSI is gone with more of a
turbine life design if you will
featuring more blades that are a lot
thinner just 0.4 millimeters wide in
fact linking everything together a5
ultra slim heat pipes and they connect
up to four individual banks of aluminium
fins it's without question one of the
most impressive and complex cooling
solutions I found working inside a
gaming laptop MSI says they design
reduces low temperatures to 71 degrees
whereas other gaming laptops run at 84
degrees or higher so I'm keen to check
out their claims I should note that I
only taught on a laptop after having
first tested it so this won't impact the
results speaking of results let's move
on to see how well the stealth pro games
and how much noise it makes when under
load first up let's quickly see how the
stealth pro handle itself in battlefield
one in this scene we can see the frame
rate hovered between 70 to 80 fps I
played this map for about five minutes
and in that time I saw an average of 83
FPS with a minimum of 64 fps so very
respectable performance using the ultra
quality preset at 1080p
moving to f1 2016 we saw an average of
61 FPS with a minimum of 44 fps again
the game was maxed out at the 1080p
resolution in this title the max GPU
temps have it around 80 degrees while
the GTX 1060 rounded a fairly consistent
74 degrees throughout the test
well the tanks played very smoothly
using max quality settings in our tests
we averaged 102 fps and never saw a
frame rates dip below 70 FPS the CPU
temperature was again around 80 degrees
and this time the GPU hits 76 degrees
Ghost Recon wildlands was played using
the medium quality preset as this game
is somewhat lacking when it comes to
optimization anyway using these settings
at 1080p we saw an average of 63 FPS
though at times frame rates did dip as
low as 47 fps Counter Strike global
Offensive was tested using the very high
quality settings with FX AAA enables
this allowed the stealth pro to average
158 FPS with a minimum of one hundred
and thirty twelve years the GPU only 72
degrees in this title well to see if you
pushed up around 86 degrees
for testing titanfall so I went with a
single-player campaign because visually
this seems more demanding than the
multiplayer portion of the game anyway
we saw an average of 73 FPS with a
minimum of 56 fps you can tell this
title is light on CPU usage as temp
stayed below 80 degrees for the core i7
7700 HQ
overwatch was silky smooth with 134 FPS
on average and frame rates never dip
below 100 FPS that said this was a bit
of a hot item for the stealth pro as it
hit 90 degrees on the CPU and 78 degrees
for the GPU
finally we have prey and here the
stealth Pro did very nicely offering an
average of 85 FPS with a minimum of 64
FPS so the game was very nice and smooth
the CPU peaked at 82 degrees while the
GPU sat about 75 degrees for the most
part overall a stealth pro performed
very well framerate performance was
excellent and the operating temperature
was exceptional for a gaming laptop
here's a quick look at how it sounds
under full load
that might sound loud but the fact is
with the laptop speakers set to even a
low volume they completely drown out any
fan noise so it's really a non-issue
especially if you plan to use headphones
operating temperatures were also very
good when gaming the GPU never throttled
and throughout our testing state below
80 degrees that said though the CPU did
often exceed 80 degrees and was at times
seen hitting as high as 90 degrees but
even so that's still very good for a
gaming laptop when it comes to battery
life gaming isn't really a consideration
however if you want to watch movies for
example I found the battery would last
for around 4 hours which isn't too bad
and again quite good for a gaming laptop
in my opinion the stealth pro is a
seriously impressive gaming laptop for a
whole host of reasons firstly I really
love the slim and lightweight design
that's great and when you couple that
with the impressive gaming performance
well you have a real winner on your
hands for me the size and weight
advantage of the stealth pro has a big
impact on daily usage while other
15-inch laptops are largely guest bound
this laptop can be comfortably taken
around and used in multiple locations
and the great thing here is that you
gain the portability without sacrificing
performance at this size weight and
price the stealth pro competes strongly
with the latest razor blade managing to
narrowly beat it in all three categories
perhaps more impressive is the fact that
it manages to pack a larger display into
a body that's marginally lighter than
the blade although the footprint of the
blade is smaller thanks to the 40 inch
display right now it's possible we got
the stealth pro for $100 US less than
the razor blade 2017 model which Tim
just reviewed also other shoppers can
now buy the stealth pro from the likes
of JB hi-fi and I'll provide a link in
the video description of course as you
guys have no doubt noticed the stealth
pro and competing laptops certainly
aren't cheap you're definitely paying a
premium for a compact gaming laptop but
still for those who want a game on the
go the premium to me seems well worth it
anyway that's going to do it for this
one I hope you guys enjoyed the review
I'm your host Steve I'll see you again
