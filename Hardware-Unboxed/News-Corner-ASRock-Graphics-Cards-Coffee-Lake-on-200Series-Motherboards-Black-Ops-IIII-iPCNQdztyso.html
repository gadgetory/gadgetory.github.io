did skip news corner last week but we
are back this week with all the news
goodness from the past week I'm still
little sick from the awful travel flu I
got last week so I'm not gonna waste any
more time let's get right into it so a
story emerged earlier this week
suggesting asrock mostly known for their
motherboards we'll be entering the
graphics card market specifically asrock
will be partnering with AMD for Radeon
graphics cards and we'll use the asrock
name entering the market as soon as
April at least this was the story from
the unreliable digi x however the guys
over at Tom's Hardware who are a bit
more reliable in their reporting than
digi times looked into this story and
uncovered a slightly different
perspective while they did confirm as
ROC is looking into graphics products
they suggested it will be ready on based
MXM cards rather than actual desktop
dedicated cards Tom sources say the
likelihood of as rock making desktop
cards is slim while it seems fairly
likely they will enter the MXM market it
seems as ROC is interested in MXM cards
for their small form-factor motherboards
that support MXM such as you know the h1
10s t XM XM for example which in turn
get used in as rocks mini pcs and while
there are lots of Nvidia MXM
manufacturers there aren't as many
partners creating AMD MXM cards so
perhaps they chose to create only AMD
MXM cards to ensure enough availability
for their own products
definitely not as exciting of a story as
it first appeared but that tends to be
the case with a lot of these rumours
models have been able to successfully
use Intel's coffee-like CPUs on
motherboards with 100 and 200 series
chipsets despite Intel claiming these
boards are unsupported coffee lake is
only supposed to work on 300 series
motherboards but a group of models on
the wind raid forums have fully detailed
how to use coffee lake with older boards
that used the same LGA 11
51 saket the trick involves modifying
the motherboard bias to include coffee
lake cpu microcode and the IGP UEFI GOP
driver and most importantly you need to
adjust the management engine firmware
once these changes are made there is a
chance the motherboard will now support
coffee like CPUs there are a few caches
firstly the mods have only worked on
asrock motherboards so far motherboard
some other brands have been tested but
the PCIe interface hasn't worked out too
well also the only CPU that has been
confirmed to work fully is the quad core
Core i3 8100 though it is speculated
other quad core chips may work too it
may be a bit tricky to get 6 core coffee
like CPUs working on these older
motherboards two different power
requirements with this discovery
anything is possible
probably not something many of you
actually try but you know it's
interesting nonetheless
also in Intel news today intel unveiled
the octane SSD 800 P in both 58 gig and
118 key capacities yep 58 and a hundred
and eighteen gig while not the first
obtain SSDs on the market we saw the SSD
900p with the PCI Express interface in
October last year the 800 P is the first
3d xpoint drive from Intel to use the
more consumer-friendly
m dot 2 2280 form factor bizarrely the
SSD 800 per use is just a pcie 3.0 x 2
interface rather than x 4 like with many
other drives however that doesn't seem
to have limited performance too much
looking at a couple of reviews from a
non tech and PC perspective it seems the
SSD 800 ppm is very strong performance
during low queue depth random workloads
along with good pair efficiency during
these tasks however there are some
pretty significant downsides at $130 and
$200 for the 58 and 118 gig models
respectively the 800 P is extremely
expensive with a cost per gigabyte
higher than the more powerful 900p you
could get a 250 gig Samsung 960 Evo for
less than the price of the 58 gig 800 P
which makes their hundred P a poor
option for most buyers its
seems these updated drives are a bit
more of just an interesting technology
than a genuine option for buyers at the
moment so hopefully that changes in time
the next topic involves AMD's project re
sx r e sx re sex anyway the company
unveiled this is part of their eighteen
point three point one Radeon driver
release re SX is short for Radeon
eSports experience which aims to
optimize some of the most popular
eSports type games for Radeon GPUs
according to AMD this means both driver
level tweaks and fixes within the games
themselves all aimed at improving
performance on average and in the
crucial 90th percentile or 1% lows and
we called Moran here AMD also tout click
to response improvements the tiles AMD's
show in their chart are pub G overwatch
and dota 2 with pub G getting the
largest performance improvements which
is definitely for the best you'd have to
say that said Amy's performance numbers
are relative to the older 17 12.1 driver
not the version directly before 18 . 3.1
so it's hard to say how many of these
changes can be attributed specifically
to this new driver also as PC
perspective notes there are no firm
plans to continue targeting these games
for optimization project re SX could
just be a one-off with a fancy name next
up we have the Rison road map bleak for
now through to 2020 which doesn't
exactly give a ton of information but
does reveal some supposed code names at
the top of the chart we have thread
Ripper which after the second gen parts
come out later this year will be
followed up with Castle Peak in 2019 and
the imaginatively named and presumably
pending a cool new codename ng h EDT or
i assume next gen high hand desktop
that's scheduled for 2024 the main am
for cpu line we have pinnacle ridge or
rising 2 followed by a Matisse with Zen
2 and Vermeer in 2020 and on the APU
front we have Picasso and Renoir coming
in 2019 and 2020 respectively following
on from the Raven Ridge launch this year
another slide showed names for Amy's
upcoming rise in to process
is none of which will surprise anyone
aside from there being fewer models than
last year and we should learn more about
rising - very shortly so stay tuned for
that one in gaming news we have two game
announcements this week the first is for
call of duty black ops 4 yes that is
iiiiii and not ivy or for anything that
actually makes sense so just an
outrageous naming choice habit
apparently it is coming out on October
12 and I'm sure a handful of people will
play it hopefully it is a bit better
than some of the recent releases but I
definitely won't be holding my breath
for anything quality when it comes to
the Call of Duty series these days
Ubisoft also teased the division 2 this
week with a logo and a statement saying
massive entertainment and a bunch of
other studios are working on the title
again no launch date here no trailer and
we'll be getting more information at e3
apparently this is how companies
announce games these days a lot of
drip-feeding so you just have to wait
for more news on the division to
Microsoft are officially out of ideas
for what to call their annual major
update to Windows this year we are
getting these spring creators update yes
that's right these spring creators
update last year we got the fall
creators update and before that the just
creators update these are terrible names
and Microsoft should feel bad about them
I'm not sure why Microsoft doesn't just
give these updates a version number like
the good old days the spring creators
update would then become Windows 10.5
and everyone would know exactly what the
situation is instead we have to put up
with rubbish like spring creators update
but anyway that should be coming out
shortly for those of you that follow
Windows 10 updates final topic for this
week we're going to look at the latest
steam hardware and software survey
numbers for February 2018 which were
just released can't say a whole lot has
been happening in the hardware market in
the past month particularly as GPU and
memory prices are keeping people from
making any upgrades but there have been
some small changes in the GPU space AMD
has gained a small amount of ground
moving from 8.2 to point nine percent of
the market at the expense of Nvidia not
that a video would care to much with
more than 85 percent of the entire steam
user base you can quite clearly see that
large increase in market share - when a
huge number of Chinese users flock to
steam last year AMD also called back a
single percentage point in CPU usage up
from eight point one to nine point one
percent again until are probably not too
concerned with more than ten times the
market share at the moment Windows 10
also gained Josh I have three percentage
points that there's still a lot of work
to clawback what Windows 10 once had
before the influx of mostly Windows 7
using Chinese gamers the GTX 1060
remains the most popular GPU on Steam
followed by the gtx 750ti and the gtx
960 it's also interesting to see that
more than three-quarters of all Steam
gamers use a 1080p display the second
most popular is 1366 by 768 and then
1440p with a measly 3.4 percent anyway
that's it for this news corner time for
me to go back a rest recover from this
flu and get back to benchmarking next
week so I'll catch you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
