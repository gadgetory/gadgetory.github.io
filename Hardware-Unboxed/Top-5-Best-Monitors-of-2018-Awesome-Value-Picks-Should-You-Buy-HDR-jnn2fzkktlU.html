time to talk about the best monitors you
can buy right now we last updated you
guys on the best monitors at the start
of 2018 well after a year's worth of
testing and plenty of new product
launches it's about time we give our
recommendations once again for the best
displays out there we've tailored these
picks specifically for the hard Rome
boxed audience so across most categories
we're focusing on gaming great displays
and products that provide the best bang
for your buck it's quite hard to
determine which monitors will give the
best value out there as there are so
many competing options and prices can
fluctuate a fair bit but I reckon these
are some really solid picks our focus is
also primarily on the US market
considering the United States is by far
our biggest audience on the channel so
we've worked out pricing based on what's
available at retailers like Amazon and
Newegg usually these picks are also good
value in other regions like Australia
and Europe but it's worth exploring
options locally if you do happen to find
any ripping deals feel free to leave
them in the comments below anyway let's
get on with our picks
we're starting here with 1080p displays
which remained the best pic for those on
a budget there are loads of excellent
options below $200 these days everything
from your dirt-cheap $80 1080p 60 hertz
displays to a collection of high refresh
monitors sorting out the good from the
bad in this price category is certainly
a bit of a challenge what we settled on
here is the viola Tec GN 24c which at
$199 is one of the best value monitors
on the market right now it's a 24 inch
1080p 144 hertz curved va display and
since we reviewed it a couple of months
ago it's actually come down in price to
now compete strongly with TN options
offering similar specs so there's a few
reasons we've chosen this particular
display for 124 inches is the perfect
size for 1080p 27-inch options are also
a good value but 1080 P pixel density
isn't really in your favor secondly 144
Hertz is the sweet spot for value sure
you can save around $50 opting for a 75
Hertz display instead but for gaming the
difference between 75 and 144 Hertz is
large enough to justify the price
difference and it gives you room to grow
as you upgrade your PC's hardware down
the track the big choice comes between
VA and TN panel quality the AOC g2 460
PF is a good choice at $180 offering a
TN panel with similar specs to the
vo-tech tree and 24 C but it's
definitely worth spending the extra $20
to get the GN 24 CSV a panel you'll get
deeper blacks a much better contrast
ratio better color performance and
superior viewing angles response times
aren't typically the strongest aspect to
a VA panel but the GN 24 C is one of the
fastest videos we've tested the only
major downside to budgetary pay displays
is factory calibration the GN 24 C isn't
amazing in this regard and neither are
most other sub $200 monitors however
it's not bad enough to significantly
affect gaming and can be corrected
through calibration it's also worth
mentioning the June 24 C has free sync
with low framerate compensation and an
attractive design making it our go-to
choice in this product category
another tricky category to make a
recommendation in is the 1440p category
this year in particular because there's
been a lot of new releases and
especially a lot of price reductions for
certain types of monitors in fact this
year is really the first year that high
refresh 1440p monitors have become
affordable and easy to recommend with
some great options around the 300 dollar
market depending on the size I'm going
to make two recommendations here because
I think 1440p is well suited to both the
27-inch and 32 inch sizes and which size
you're after is probably going to be a
personal preference thing so 27 inches
I'm recommending the new Samsung JG 50
and then at 32 inches the pic Co px 3 to
9 both of these are 1440p high refresh
VA monitors with high refresh VA once
again providing the best bang for your
buck the Samsung JG 50 can often be
found at $300 as a 144 Hertz curved
monitor at 27 inches with free sync
while the pic Co px 3 to 9 is a steal at
just $350 for a 32 inch 165 Hertz flat
monitor also with free sync support like
with the 1080p category for gamers these
days it's really not worth getting a
1440p 60 Hertz monitor you only be
saving around 50 dollars even if you
don't have the GPU horsepower to hit
high frame rates at 1440p getting a high
refresh monitor now will last you for
years and will make it easier to justify
GPU upgrades if you're like most people
and won't upgrade your monitor for five
years at this point it would just be
silly not to go high refresh especially
with prices having dropped several
hundred dollars in the last year and a
half in our testing we found the px 3 to
9 to be a strong contender across our
performance metrics and right now having
come down in price by nearly a hundred
bucks in just a few months since we
reviewed it it's the best bang for your
buck monitor on the entire market in our
opinion the Samsung JG 50 is also a
great buy for those after a tweet 7 inch
panel with both the Samsung and pixel
options offering the usual benefits of
VA panels like deep blacks great viewing
angles good contrast ratios and vibrant
colors
ultra wide monitors are another category
that has seen significant price
reductions across 2018 for some of the
best options in fact right now it's
possible to get a 34 inch 34 40 by 1440
21:9 ultra-wide monitor with free sync
support and a 100 Hertz refresh rate for
less than $500 which is such a great
price for those specs the monitor
available at that price is the vo-tech
GN 34 C which comes in a few dollars
under $500 u.s. offering almost the
complete package for a 21-9 display
right now it's got a 1440p class
resolution a fast hundred hertz refresh
rate it uses VA technology so you're
getting all the usual VA benefits like
great colors and great contrast and with
an 1800 eye curvature it's curved nicely
for gaming we've tested the VA panel the
GN 34 seat uses in the past and found it
to hold up well across our metrics these
days you can get 120 Hertz IPS panels
and a similar size and resolution but
the price increase for an extra 20 Hertz
simply isn't worth it and in many
respects the VA pound used in the GN 34c
is better anyway
so really it's very hard to pass on the
screaming value of the GN 34c offers one
thing I will note is the GN 34 seat is
set to be replaced shortly by the Newark
GN 34 C X however the specifications are
almost identical and the June 34 c x
will also be available for $500 so
really once again biotech is giving by
some of the best value displays on the
market right now
my recommendation in the 4k monitor
category is very different the other
three categories we've just covered the
reason for this is I don't think 4k
monitors are a great option for gamers
right now most gamers will be better off
with a 1440p high refresh display the
resolution won't be quite as good but
the high refresh rate will make a much
bigger impact your gaming than the
slight quality improvement moving to 4k
would provide yeah you can get 4k 144
Hertz monitors these days but they're
simply too expensive for most people so
right now 4k monitors are better suited
to professionals and content creators
that don't really require high refresh
rates and the best 4k professional
monitor on the market right now is the
dell ultrasharp
you p27 18q this monitor seriously has
everything it's a 27 inch 4k IPS display
with true 10-bit color support not 8-bit
plus frc it supports 100% coverage of
both srgb and Adobe RGB gamuts plus
97.7% coverage of DCI p3 which places it
among the best monitors for gamut
coverage and because it's part of Dells
premier color line it's factory
calibrated to a delta 8 of less than 2.0
and it supports custom color profiles
you can create yourself but wait there's
more the UPP 27:18 cue is a proper hgr
monitor it supports up to a thousand
nits of peak brightness and has a 384
zone F Ald backlight for excellent HDR
contrast ratios when you combine that
with a wide color gamut and true
tempered support it's one of the best
hgr monitors on the market right now and
allows creators to work not only with
accurate srgb colors but with accurate
HDR as well of course it doesn't come
cheap with an MSRP of $2000 and a
current price on Dells website of around
fifteen hundred and fifty US dollars but
good professional monitors don't come
cheap and this is one of the best I'd
also recommend the a sous Pro art PA 32
you see - K as a 32 inch 4k true HDR
monitor for professionals it's a bit
larger than the U P 27:18 Q but it's
also more expensive selling for about
$500 more if you need the extra size it
could be a good option but my preference
right now would be to save 500
doors and get the smaller dough monitor
instead
this final category is really only for
those that have money to burn or we're
specifically looking for my
recommendation for HDR monitors
unfortunately the state of the HDR
monitor ecosystem at the moment isn't
great there are lots of monitors that
claim to be actually are compatible but
ultimately don't deliver a great HDR
experience this is either because
brightness is too low contrast isn't
good enough or color gamut isn't higher
than SDR there are a surprising number
of monitors where all three factors are
issues and even more monitors where at
least one of the three factors doesn't
reach the required standard for HDR this
makes shopping for an HDR monitor
extremely difficult because it's often
unclear which will deliver a good HDR
experience or which merely have fake HDR
considering the HJ monitor ecosystem is
not nearly as mature as the HDR TV
ecosystem chances are a monitor
advertised as supporting HDR will only
deliver a fake HD I experience even
popular models like Samsung's see HD 70
aren't really up to scratch as far as
HDR is concerned so my advice for most
people interested in HDR monitors is
don't bother the risk of fake HDR is too
high and within a year weird likely to
have much better HDR offerings on the
market it's simply too early to jump
into the HDR ecosystem and I'd hate for
anyone to buy an expensive HDR monitor
only to discover later that they got
something with fake HDR if a monitor
says it supports HDR make sure it's a
good SDR monitor at a good price first
and then treat any HDR support as a free
bonus and don't pay extra for HDR either
I've seen plenty of monitors where they
offer HDR and an added price but the HDR
mode isn't really any better than SDR
with all that crucial information out of
the way there are some monitors that
deliver true HDR the del u P 27:18 Q I
mentioned earlier is one but if you're
specifically after HDR for gaming there
is basically only one monitor on the
market I'd be comfortable recommending
at the moment and that's the ace of
Predator X 27 the predator X 27 is a 4k
144 Hertz panel with true HDR so it
supports up to 1000 nits of brightness
it has a 384 zone F Ald backlight and it
as a wider color gamut it also has
g-sync HDR and comes factory calibrated
with excellent performance across most
metrics it's basically the best gaming
monitor on the market but it's also not
cheap at seventeen hundred dollars
through Amazon the only time I'd
recommend the printed x27 is if you
really want a top-end
HDR monitor right now and you have a ton
of money to burn honestly those 350 or
1440p 165 Hertz monitors are recommended
earlier are much much better value
there's also the risk that the predator
x27 will be superseded with a better
more affordable version shortly so you
run into the typical concerns of an
early adopter with this product but
right now it is the best HDR gaming
monitor it's just not something I think
is worth it for everyone so that
basically sums up my current monitor
recommendations the options at 1080p and
1440p are particularly great buyers at
the moment I reckon and it's nice to see
prices coming down across many
categories one thing you might be asking
at this point is why we haven't
recommended many g-sync monitors what if
I'm an NVIDIA GPU owner and I want to
get adaptive sync and that's a fair
question considering NVIDIA GPUs are by
far the most popular and most
recommendations here were for free sync
models however my opinion is that for
most buyers spending an extra two
hundred dollars or more for g-sync just
isn't worth it take our 27-inch 1440p
144 Hertz monitor recommendation the
Samsung JG 50 at 300 bucks for a g-sync
equivalent you're looking at the Acer
predator xB 271 hu as the cheapest but
not only is this monitor $500 so $200
more than the JJ fifty or sixty six
percent more expensive it's also a TN
display not VA so image quality will be
worse dao c a.g 27 1q g gets you an IPS
panel for five hundred and fifty dollars
but then we're looking at a price that's
more than eighty percent higher is it
worth spending eighty percent more just
to get adaptive sync absolutely not it's
a nice feature to have but that kind of
price hike is just insane especially
when the difference between adaptive
sync on and off isn't that significant
at higher frame rates it
make a difference in the 40 to 70 FPS
range but with these high refresh
monitors if your gaming above 70 FPS the
difference is negligible and at no stage
is the improvement worth such a massive
price increase so that's it for this
video you can find links to current
prices for the monitors we've
recommended in the description below
