benchmark video this time we're looking
at geforce gtx 980ti
sli performance on the horizon 7 1800 X
Rosen 5 1600 X and core i7 7700 K
processors now the reason I'm taking two
of the fastest gaming graphics cards
available right now and comparing their
sli performance on these processes is
because I can actually the idea for such
a comparison was as it often is
conceived by the viewers back when the
horizon 7 Series was first introduced
and there was all that controversy over
testing performance at the 4k resolution
a few cheeky viewers suggested that I
give in and do the same but with a pair
of Pascal Titan X graphics cards I
thought that was an interesting idea and
I had planned to check it out quite a
few weeks ago but of course as is often
the case something else popped up that
was a bit more time-sensitive even right
now I have a heap of different projects
on the go but with the recent arrival of
Rison 5 I thought why not give the idea
ago this test was also a lot less
interesting before the GTX 1080 TI was
released previously too-tight next big P
graphics cards wouldn't set you back
2400 us if you're going to blow that
kind of money you might as well just buy
a core i7 69 50 X however now we have
the wallet-friendly GT X 1080 Ti at just
$700 us just $700 us guys get yours
today how why not get 2 for a sweet
$1400 SLI setup next you're going to
want to know do you go Rison or cabe you
like good question let's go find out all
testing has been conducted in the past
few days using the latest Nvidia display
driver 380 1.65 and an up-to-date
version of windows 10 - the creators
update which caused a lot of games that
we test with to crash the 1800 X and
1600 X have been overclocked to 4
gigahertz and although we did use the
flagship 8.6 core models the same
performance can be achieved with the
1700 X 1700 and 1600 for example the
7700 K has been cranked up to four point
eight gigahertz which is an easily
achievable overclock for this processor
in total eight games were tested using a
single G
AET I along with SLI configuration since
we are using nvidia gpus we stuck with
DirectX 11 testing to avoid the issue
Rison seems to have with nvidia gpus
using DirectX 12 right now right then on
to the benchmarks first up we have Deus
Ex mankind divided and here we see using
a single GTX 1080p our graphics card at
4k provides similar performance across
all three CPUs tested if we look at the
sli results we start to see some
variation in performance the 7700 K
provided the best performance here
though it is clocked 20% higher thanks
to Kaiba lakes ability to clock higher
the 1% time results provided the
greatest variance between the Rison
processes the 1800 X here was 13% faster
than the 1600 X while the 1800 X and
7700 K were very similar for this metric
moving to the average frame rate we see
that 7700 K was 5% faster but this isn't
a significant margin though it did mean
that overall the KB Lake cpu what's
faster Far Cry primal is the game that I
have previously dumped from our battery
r games we use for measuring CPU
performance but I brought it back to see
if in this test SLI changed anything as
you can see here SLI doesn't help rise
and with the second geforce gtx 980ti
helping out the frame time performance
goes unchanged for the rise in cpus
while the average is boosted by just 25%
meanwhile the 77 Erik ALS for 67% more
frames when using SLI though here the
0.1% data is less impressive using a
single GTX 1080i at 4k
again we see that all three CPUs
provided very similar performance in
fact this time they delivered identical
performance adding a second GTX 10 ADC I
increased horizons performance by 30%
and the 7700 k's average frame rate by
46% that says looking at the frame time
data there is virtually no difference in
performance between the three CPUs
tested the Mass Effect Andromeda results
are interesting using a single gtx 1080i
the 77 her okay was just 5% faster but
with 210 ATT is in sli the 77 okay is
now 19 % faster at least when comparing
the average frame rate we know that at
4k using a single GT X 1080 o we our GPU
bound and this is likely still the case
with 210 attrs from previous tests we
know that a 1080p
the rising CPUs can push the 1080 tio2
an average of over 120 FPS so I'm not
sure why the 1800 X and 1600 X struggles
so much here again this is probably down
to a display driver issue The Witcher 3
Wild Hunt is the oldest game we test
with and here we see mostly consistent
scaling by adding a second gtx 1080i we
see the 7700 k performance is boosted by
70% while the rising sea views were
boosted by 65% that said the 7700 K did
a much better job when looking at the
frame time data as we've seen for most
of the games tested when using a single
gtx 980ti the performance was much the
same for all three cpus moving the sli
results and here we see the 7700 K
starts to pull ahead though given its
clock speed advantage the fact that it
was just 14 percent faster when
comparing the average frame rate bodes
quite well for Rison I should note that
total war Warhammer has been recently
updated to improve horizons performance
so this explains why the numbers look so
good here now the overwatch scaling is
very odd indeed as we find adding a
second gtx 1080i boost performance by
more than 100 percent for all three cpus
tested I should note though that this
isn't true for the point 1 percent and 1
percent results logically it doesn't
seem possible for performance to be
boosted by more than 100% when adding a
second GPU but this is a strange
phenomenon that has been seen by others
as well what's more interesting is that
the scaling is even more extreme on the
rise and cpus whereas the 1800 x was 25%
slow on the 77 or ok with a single GTX
10 atti adding a second reduce the
margin to just 17 percent it's certainly
worth noting that the 1800 X offered
better 0.1 percent and 1 percent
performance last but certainly not least
we have battlefield 1 these are perhaps
the most interesting results as the 7700
K went from being the fastest CPU tested
with a single GTX to the GI graphics
card to the slowest with a pair of them
looking at the average frame rate the
7,700 case are a mere 20 percent
performance boost when employing sli
meanwhile the 1800s received a 34
percent performance boost
that's still pretty miserable scaling to
be honest but it was surprising the fine
rise and pulling ahead in this title so
there you have it a mixed batch of
results that tell us investing in two
GPUs is generally a bad idea with such
mixed results it really is difficult to
draw any
solo conclusions from the data really
the only concrete conclusion here is
that SLI scaling is all over the place
even in games that support the
technology if we average the results
across the eight games tested this is
what we find on average of the 7700 K
allowed for an average frames per second
boost of 65 percent when using SL live
this margin though was reduced to 55
percent when using the 1800 X in either
situation no pay 100% more which in this
case is $700 us to extract nowhere near
100% more performance in most games it's
not exactly a wise investment still if
you were to pick a graphics card to use
SLI with the GTX 10 atti makes the most
sense I'm personally not a fan of SLI at
all but have noted in the past that if
you are going to use multi GPU
technology it should be reserved for the
most extreme GPUs it's interesting to
note that while the 7700 K was on
average 14% fast in the 1800 X when
comparing the average FPS it was just 8%
faster for the 1% time and 2% faster for
the point 1% time in games where SLI
scaled well such as overwatch and The
Witcher 3 we see that Rison was able to
do with a similar scaling performance to
that of the 7700 K the same is also
likely true for that our updated total
war Warhammer it's just that the 7700 K
was GPU bound with a single gtx 1080i
the fact that Verizon was just 12%
slower on warhammer using the 1080 Ti
SLI configuration is actually a very
impressive result given it is clocked at
17 percent lower of course there's
nothing AMD can do about the clock speed
deficit for now
Rison is inferior to the smaller table 8
processors when it comes to clock speeds
and until games require more than four
cores this will hurt them in the short
term of course we have already seen
under more realistic conditions when
using something like the gtx 1070 or
fury x rising is even more competitive
as these mid-range to high-end GPUs
usually provide GPU limited scenarios I
do ever hate more testing coming up that
looks into this and so far the results
do look very interesting getting back to
this video though I had planned to test
around a dozen CPU demanding titles that
was until I discovered that most of them
don't support SLI
games such as f1 2016 Gears of War 4
hitman and mafia 3 were all dropped due
to their lack of SLI support
there were plenty of others but I'm not
going to waste time rattling off dozens
of games of course there were other
titles that did support SLI which could
have been included but they were mostly
GPU bound and probably wouldn't have had
as much value to the CPU comparison
after a few of you guys planted the idea
in my head this is a test that I became
quite keen to do as a really don't plan
SLI or crossfire that much and well now
having completed the testing I remember
why in the end the results weren't
really interesting or they weren't
nearly as interesting as I thought they
might be but I hope that satisfies the
curiosity of those of you who asked for
the test I hope no one from Nvidia is
watching this video because I want to
keep receiving samples from them but I
also want to feed you guys a rubbish so
yeah SLI isn't very good to put it
nicely actually to be fair multi GPU
technology in general sucks on a whole
it's wildly inefficient due to a lack of
proper support and things really only
seem to be getting worse still if you
can afford one extreme high-end graphics
card and wouldn't blink twice at the
prospect of picking up a second then
honestly SLI exists because of you so
you might as well take the bait okay
guys that's all for this one I promise
there is a much more relevant test
coming later in the week so keep your
eyes peeled for that as always thanks
for watching I'm your host Steve catch
again soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
