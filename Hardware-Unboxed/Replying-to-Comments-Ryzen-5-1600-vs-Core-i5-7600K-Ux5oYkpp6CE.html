have another episode of replying to
comments the only show where I reply to
your comments yeah it's exactly what it
sounds like really anyway for this one
we will be looking at the comments post
on the risin 5 1600 vs. Core i5 7600 K
video from last week there were around
2000 comments on that video so we have a
lot to go over that being the case let's
hear from today's video sponsor then
we'll get into the comments meet as
rocks new flagship Zedd 390 motherboard
the phantom gaming X it's packed with
loads of upgrades including a six
hundred amp capacity twelve phase V core
VRM 2.5 Gigabit LAN with an additional 2
Gigabit LAN connectors Wi-Fi six
creative Sound Blaster cinema 5 loads of
USB 3.0 ports SATA ports and m2 ultra
ports there's also a number of really
nice design elements such as integrated
i/o shield stainless-steel PCIe covers a
massive heat sink for cooling the m dot
2 drives a metal backplate and much much
more so for more information please
check the link in the video description
ok welcome back from that brief ad break
we'll get into the first question here
from easy 45 I think it is ok if the
question or comment rather is sorry guys
but as of Windows Update 1903 you're
gonna have to redo the entire video just
days after it going online feel like
you're rubbing in a bit there as it
improved Rison scheduling dramatically
drastically that's the word
okay well the Rison 5 1600 along with
the core i5 77 ok were tested on the
1903 build so that's actually been out
for some time now which is why these big
claims of rise and performance up lists
are a bit surprised and they sort of I
came out of nowhere because people have
been testing this build for quite some
time now but anyway the point of
updating all my CPU data and time
presenter is to do so with the latest
available build of Windows all the
current security updates
latest BIOS updates on the boards we're
using all that kind of stuff basically
test with everything updated so yeah we
will already test
with 1903 and as we saw in our video
from a few days ago that actually has no
impact on performance and I've tested
this with the horizon 5 1600 compared to
the 1809 build the previous version of
Windows no difference there there's a
new chipset driver not sure if that has
any performance improvements to deliver
or not we'll check that out soon but
anyway everything was up to date ok next
question is from a Kiwi you weight is
the IPC on the 1600 really that good can
it actually beta 7600 K even clocked
nearly 1 gigahertz slower well yeah it
is really that good when it's fully
utilized it's pretty well and matter or
yeah it's a matter of CPU resources the
1600 just has loads more of them so yeah
games that require only 4 threads for
example they will run better on the 70
turn ok because it is clocked much
higher there's also some latency stuff
in there that we've explored in the past
but yeah the 70 Center K has a huge
advantage when only using 4 cores and 4
threads however once those 4 cores and 4
threads are overwhelmed even at 5
gigahertz then the Rison 5 1600 will
have a massive advantage because it's
got well as you point out there's about
a 23% clock speed advantage so when only
using 4 cores it should be it could be
up to around 20% faster but
unfortunately that clock speed advantage
isn't enough to outweigh the lack of CPU
resources so the Rison 5 1600 has I
think it's about an well depending on
how you work at SMT it's about a 90%
increase in CPU resources for the 1600
if you were to say SMT improves the
efficiency of each core by about 25% I
think it's fair to say it improves it by
at least that much so at least 90% more
CPU resources that's obviously a lot of
extra resources to work with so once
those four core for threaded CPUs get
tapped out then the 6 core 12 threaded
Rison 5 processor just has way
or Headroom so yeah that's why in games
where the quad-core was tapped out the
Rison processor was so much faster okay
next question here is from Jake thank
you Steve for this retrospective video
excellent work as always you deliver as
Ted Verizon can you please do the 1,800
X and 7700 K next well firstly thank you
Jake that is much appreciated and always
yeah always nice to hear that you guys
like the benchmark videos that I do
because they take a bit of time anyway
yeah thank you
there's a good chance that I will
revisit the 77 oh okay
though I'll probably compare that with
the r7 1700s
I believe those two CPUs were roughly
the same price the 1800 X was quite a
bit more expensive and because of that
it wasn't really great value we always
recommend you as just get the seven
seventeen hundred and overclock that to
get 1800 X or better performance I
should warn you guys that I don't expect
the rise in seven processor to make out
nearly as well as the Rison v did
against the 7600 K the rise and 7
processors do have way more system
resources but the issue is games don't
require a cause yet so an eight-course
16 thread CPU isn't fully utilized by
really any game moreover while the four
core for threaded CPUs really aren't
enough for today's most demanding games
you can skate by just with a fork or
eight threaded processor so the 7700 K
will most likely be okay and all the
games we test with but it's still an
interesting in paracin so I'll do my
best to make that happen soon okay I
think I've added a bit of a doozy here
for you guys we've got one here from dot
JPEG okay I love the way these always
start out this test is not correct you
should put the GPU below 100% so you can
see which processor would push the GPU
more closely to its limits
hmm yeah I always love when someone
starts by claiming the test is incorrect
or flawed this one wasn't too aggressive
sometimes they're very very rude but
yeah this one this one's fine but yeah I
always find it funny when they tell you
that you're doing
something wrong or it's incorrect and
then they actually go on to give their
reason that makes absolutely no sense so
yeah mister JPEG should probably
research how or research the
relationship between the CPU and GPU
research how that works and yeah you'll
you'll probably find that question to be
a bit odd now while we're looking at the
doozies we might as well just get this
one out of the way
this one's from Nikolas straight away
straight away just starts with stupid
comparison so it's hard to work it's
hard to work with anyone on something
like that when they just come out with a
stupid comparison right off the bat but
that's what Nikolas did and then again
just the follow up why are you trying to
prove what are you sorry what are you
trying to prove rather comparing a four
core versus six core processor so yeah
again I probably couldn't have made this
episode without including Nicholas's
comment because shortly after the video
went live he made this comment and I
pinned it because it was a yeah I always
loved the ones that start off so
aggressively with something like a
stupid comparison so whenever someone
does that I usually just ignore the
comments so if you do want to get some
feedback for so you're a bit confused by
something maybe just oh wait a word this
comment would have been a little bit
confused to you guys just would like to
know why you think it's a good idea to
compare a four core CPU - a six core CPU
and I would have happily replied to that
but anyway yeah so Nikolas went and did
that I addressed it then he replied with
something else and then you guys piled
on I think that comment thread got about
400 replies before Nikolas just decided
enough was enough and deleted it I don't
really feel bad about pinning it though
because well Tim and myself along with
pretty much every other content creator
put up with that kind of nonsense and
sometimes abuse on a daily basis so to
give an anonymous user bit of a taste of
their own medicine it's a small bit of
justice in my mind anyway he wasn't the
only one to make that sort of comment
though he's was probably the most poorly
worded or the rudest way of going about
it anyway because others do ask the
question I answered it quite politely to
them but for those who are wondering why
we compared a fork or CPU against a six
core CPU it's pretty simple really the
r5 1600 was released in 2017 and its
main competitor at the time was the more
expensive 7600 K so the video was merely
looking back at how that battle was
being fought out today in 2019 okay next
question is from Adriano I hope I got
your name right apologies if I didn't
does someone know the model of that
black / orange case I loved it
I got quite a few people actually asking
about that case I haven't I used that
b-roll well probably ever since I made
the original video so yeah that was a
case I made well I suppose this a bit of
a joke really it's not yeah I don't know
I just I just made it because no real
reasons it was meant to be a Rison /
over watched typed themed build that I
called rise and watch pretty amazing
name I know yeah basically it was a
risin 5 1,600 system by coincidence that
I built back in 2017 to see how many
frames we could push in overwatch
because a lot of people were saying that
their eyes and processes weren't good
for eSports titles and yeah we thought
we'd put that to the test and from
memory it ran overwatch extremely well
so yeah and just for that video for
something different I don't know why I
just decided I would custom paint the
cooler master master case maker
5 T I think it was so yeah if you want
to watch that video I suppose you google
rice and watch it's probably the fastest
way to find it and yeah you can check
that video out coming here from
Alexander haha
Jared Walton from PC gamer used to argue
in the comments in favor of the i-5 7000
series well firstly no relation to Jared
despite us both having the same second
name and secondly I think if anyone who
was arguing that the Core i5 processor
was the better buy or the better gaming
CPU back in 2017 yeah not exactly the
most stupidest thing ever that as I said
in even my recent video you could have
easily argued in favor of the Core i5
processor because it was the faster
processor at the time
it was significantly faster in some
games especially when taking
overclocking into account so yeah it was
kind of a bit of a gamble with Rison it
seemed like I said because it had so
many more CPU resources that at some
point it would become the better gaming
CPU I was thinking it would probably be
at least two years we're starting to see
some evidence of that now where there
are some games that don't run very well
at all in the 7600 K or they just run
better on the Rison 5 processor but I
wouldn't be too hard on guys that were
recommending the 7600 K back in 2017
because it wasn't that obvious or that
clear that the rising 5 processor would
prove to be the better option down the
track because well there was the whole
bulldozer thing and all that and yeah
those CPUs when fully utilized aren't
great in gaming either they're not
really that much better than four core
Sandy Bridge processors if they are at
all these days because they kind of
bottleneck themselves it's just a really
bad architecture so yeah they're people
were probably that left a bad taste in
reviewers mouths let's say so they
weren't too eager to recommend a new AMD
processor that didn't look particularly
hot at the time but yeah so that was
that so you know I wouldn't go giving
people too much of a hard time if they
were saying those things back in 2017 it
was a little more obvious sort of midway
through 2018 and on and obviously now it
would be absolutely stupid directly to
recommend anyone invest in a quad-core
processor over something Verizon ok and
a pretty good follow-on to that I think
is one here from Constantine and this
one targets more buyers than reviewers
the comment goes something like this
imagine buying a four thread CP on 2017
where you could get a 12 thread part for
less money paid more for the motherboard
and now you're stuck on a dead platform
just for simple frames in old games
don't forget also that your CPU is
getting slower each passing quarter
because of security vulnerabilities ouch
just having to look my notes here this
comment had over 800 up votes so what do
you guys clearly agree with it and I
think it's fair to say I agree with
pretty well everything you've said
in hindsight yet
everything you've said pretty well right
two years ago like I said it was a bit
iffy which way to go it was a little bit
of a gamble with the risin fire
processor because it was slower and
pretty much everything at the time and I
will say one thing if you are the kind
of person that likes to build a new
computer every about two to three years
let's say two years and I do have some
friends that sort of every two years ago
now I want a whole new computer I've
worked my backside off for two years now
I want a new everything and some people
do do that and if you're that kind of
person or you don't mind buying a ABI
450 motherboard for example and spending
like $100 there then yeah the core i5
7600 cave probably would have been a
better short-term solution because it
was faster in pretty much every game
yeah there's some games like Battlefield
where frame consistency might be a bit
of an issue but for the most part you
know if you play games like Starcraft to
see us go ARMA 3 and the list just goes
on and on
then the 7600 K would have been the
better short-term option however if you
like to invest in a computer and you
want to upgrade it with as little
further investment as possible then you
would have been much better off with the
risin 5 1600 because well it's still
playing games perfectly fine today it's
not on a dead platform so you have the
option to easily slot in as into
processor and our way you go for well
the forseeable so yeah this would be too
hard on people that went the other way
but it's quite clear now that yeah the
Rison 5 1600 was the better long-term
solution the next one here is from
CyanogenMod 'red I won't try that again
I love these retrospective videos keep
them going Steve yeah well I got good
news for ya I really like making them so
yeah I'll keep doing them I always find
it funny when I do make these kind of
throwback Thursday videos which I
usually put them on Thursdays whether
it's looking at an old GPU or whatever
and someone says oh it must be a slow
week if you're having a look back at old
hardware but yeah I actually find it to
be the most fun really the most
interesting benchmark sessions because I
know what we said
years ago and then how does that apply
to today so you ain't glad you guys
enjoy them because yeah I love making
him back next one's from in death site
99 and okay so this is sort of talking
about what I said or didn't say so I I
talked about this why should I read the
comment first it's probably the best way
to do this talks about how much a 77 or
okay used is doesn't talk about resale
price of 7600 K so yeah you can sell
your 7600 K processor to recoup some of
the funds and then that'll help cover
the cost of investing in a 70 seminar
okay so I suppose I should rewind a
little bit
basically I said because the LJ what is
at 11:51 socket is now dead very much
dead 4 KB Lake because that was the
follow-on from sky like your only option
if you have a 7600 cane you don't want
to replace your motherboard your only
option there is to buy a 7700 K and used
they are astronomically expensive it's
actually cheaper to buy an 8 quart Rison
processor even like there's n2 ones
coming up it's crazy so I made note of
that this guy is sort of saying well
yeah but you can sell your 7600 ok so
why didn't you talk about that um well
it's just an inconvenience I suppose you
can sell your 7600 K it depends on well
some regions are a bit more difficult to
sell things or they don't fetch quite as
much money but anyway whatever the case
is yeah you can sell you 7600 K but I'd
say you're still gonna be at least $100
u.s. out of pocket for getting the 77
okay and that still sucks really it
still doesn't really make the 77 or ik a
particularly great up upgrade from a
7600 K when you're starting to pay $100
so yeah it's still a pretty crappy
position to be in
so yeah I mean doesn't change too much
for me on that one like I said if you
had a bought into the a m4 platform then
you'd have a heap of options and it'd
just be a better situation of being so
that's that ok next comment here looks
like that is mash to the keyboard when
putting in their user name no mention of
the newest vulnerabilities affecting SMT
strange
you'd be surprised how many people made
this comment despite the fact that the
72 okay obviously doesn't have SMT
support and that's why it's a four core
four threaded CPU I was like the whole
point of the video so that's probably
the only thing that's strange here some
viewers were quite aggressive about this
type of comment calling me a fanboy for
not disabling it because of the new well
the zombie load vulnerability se bit
strange that one few people did retract
their aggressive comments when I pointed
out that all standard power desktop core
i5 processors don't have hyper threading
so anyway alright next one here from MH
did you use the built-in Mumbai or Miami
benchmark when testing hitman two
I find the biggest improvement after
DirectX 12 update is in game GPU and CPU
usage is still all over the place in
those benchmarks so yeah I didn't use
the built-in benchmark for hitman two I
I only used one can benchmark and that
is for World War Z so yeah that's the
built-in benchmark for that title
because it does do quite an excellent
job I feel of simulating gameplay so we
don't mind using it for that particular
title for all the other titles though I
conduct a custom in-game benchmark pass
and the area that I test is actually up
in the corner of the graph so that's
pretty much usually showing you the the
general area of where the test takes
place okay next question is from my
simple gaming can you compare the
horizon 1200 and i-5 7600 K both are
quad-core CPUs I expect a very
interesting result well I have to say I
don't expect a terribly interesting
result on that one because as we note at
the very start of this replying to
comments episode the 7600 K is massive
clock speed advantage well that'll
pretty much allow it to smoke the
horizon 3 processor so yeah it would be
pretty bad comparison to be honest with
you and it's not really one worth making
because the Core i5 processor did cost
way more so you got to keep in mind the
r3
1,200 that was positioned as the most
entry level rise in part for the first
generation of rising CPUs and the 72nd
RK was one of the more high-end cable
eight parts so yeah I mean they have
similar CPU resources but the core i5
processor is a lower latency
architecture that's better for gaming
and it clocks way higher so yeah
wouldn't wouldn't be a great fight that
one for AMD and it's as I said not too
much point doing it because you're
comparing a relatively high end
processor of its time to an entry level
processor so yeah we'll move on just as
I make some excuses for why I wouldn't
compare the particular Intel AMD CPU we
get this fun from old Peter chestnut
love how many excuses are made for the
rise in chip in these tests where it
lost then praise it or rather it gets
praised when it comes out ahead no bias
at all did you get these kinds of
comments quite a lot whenever I say
something in the negative are positive
about our favorite AMD and Teller and
video products so yeah I mean I always
feel like people who make these comments
they're kind of really bias one way and
they really notice when you make
comments that they don't particularly
like about a certain product or whatever
then they have to sort of project that
in the comments section so I'm not
really sure what excuses I made for
Rison in that video in titles such as
Rage 2 one of the games I test I think
it was far cry new dawn but anyway the
games that lost in and basically I
pointed out that those are games that
work perfectly fine on a quad core
processor or World War Z was another one
so I think they were the three main
games those ones so all I said was
basically the horizon 516 hundred isn't
faster in those games because those
games only require called core AK what a
quad core processor that's what they're
called a full core processor that's even
easier that's all they require so
because it has a 23 percent a clock
speed advantage naturally it's going to
be faster so I just pointed that out
that wasn't making any excuses and then
about praising it for winning I mean I
was impressed by how much better the our
516 her was in the demanding titles I'm
not sure where else to tell you on that
one I feel like the commentary was based
on facts and it was extremely fair and
the whole point of the video was to see
if the extra CPU resources of the
horizon processor were being utilized in
today's modern games
so naturally the commentary was going to
be sort of focused around that actually
following on for that I've done a good
job of putting these comments in some
sort of order I swear that wasn't
intentional I didn't put much time and
effort into it I usually just picked
these randomly but anyway the next one
is great video thank you very much
please make a similar one in another two
years I'll probably make one next year
I'm 100 100 percent sure the Rison 560
hundred will still be completely
comfortable with 2021 releases and I'm
not sure about the 7600 K this exactly
confirms what I was saying back in 2017
yeah like I said I'll probably do this
revisit once every year because I really
enjoy doing it and we've got 12 months
of content to make we make a video
nearly every day actually pretty well
every day so I think I can probably
squeeze that into the schedule next year
but I am very confident that you are
right and that was the point of the
recent video obviously games are
becoming more demanding they're
requiring more CPU resources and the
Rison v 1600 has more CPU resources at
its disposal I also think you are right
in saying that in 2021 the r5 1600 will
still be hanging in there while the 7600
K will be as good as dead so it'll be
kind of amusing to see it trying to try
to hang in there but it won't be so yeah
anyway that's yeah I agree with that
question or comment okay last question
here I meant well I'm gonna make it the
last question because we have a huge
storm on the way it's already started
rang so hopefully doesn't get too loud
so let's just get into it
sermo I do remember arguing with tech
reviewers who argued Intel was going to
be more future proof by doing low res
tests
well I guess I was right and they were
wrong yeah this is going to cause some
controversy in the comment section below
no doubt yeah I mean yes and no on that
one
so low resolution testing where you
remove the GPU as the performance
limiting component is exactly how you
should test a CPU so low res game tests
are still valid and should be conducted
and I've said it many times I don't have
a problem with higher resolution testing
that's also quite interesting so the
more GPU limited testing but you
absolutely need to show CP limited
results as well factors game engines
that were tested in 2017 are still
largely used today and the 76 Enrique is
still faster in the majority of those
games but as I noted two years ago
something like the r5 1600 does have
significantly more resources and today
we're now starting to see the benefits
of that as those resources are put to
you so you can't weigh everything on low
resolution testing and I did say that
all those years ago it's certainly a
good indicator of how the CPUs perform
now and will perform in the vast
majority of games for at least the next
year possibly the next few years and I
think it's fair to say that we have
still seen that like I'm not claiming
that the the r5 1600 faster than the
7600 K in the majority game some people
seem to think that that was what I was
suggesting in that last video that
certainly wasn't the point of that video
it was to show you guys that yeah we are
getting into some some new territory
where games like Assassin's Creed
Odyssey battlefield 5 shadow of the term
Raider games like that
yeah the r5 1600 is starting to pull
ahead but for all the other games the 76
of RK is still the superior CPU so I
think my point is if you're advocating
for one type of testing over the other
and not really short the other type of
testing is I mean its its CPU limiter
its GPU limited testing and doing just
GPU limited testing is kind of dumb so
you've got to do CPU limited testing but
don't weigh everything on
because if there's a CPU that has 90%
more resources then yeah bit of better
forward thinking on that one probably
wouldn't go astray so yeah not much more
to say on that one will continue to do
lowish resolution testing I mean 1080p
with an RC X 20 ATT is really as low as
you need to go beyond that you just sort
of blowing the margin out further to
really unrealistic proportions so no
that's gonna do it for that one and the
rain is just sort of quieting down
before the storm comes so I think that's
a good place to end this replying to
episodes
what is it replying to comments episode
what's it called I don't know that's
it's getting too late so yeah if you
enjoyed this video be sure to the like
button you can subscribe for more
content I have more benchmark videos
coming up it sounds like I'm gonna have
to go do a 7700 K versus r7 1700
benchmark so I'll probably do that over
the next few days so stay tuned for that
I suppose and Tim I'll have more Tim
type content ok thank you for watching
I'm your host Steve actually before I
say that you can make sure you like this
video do that because apparently liking
videos is helpful these days so I don't
know just if you can hit the like button
that'd be cool and you can also support
us on patreon if you want to chat to us
in discord give us a hard time if you
want to do that go for that you can
watch our monthly live stream we'll be
doing that next week I think it Tim's
coming here so we're gonna do our Q&amp;amp;A
here and our patreon livestream for the
first time in a very long time will be
done in my studio so I'm excited about
that anyway thank you for watching I'm
again your host Steve and I'll see you
again next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
