bit of a sucker for slim gaming laptops
as they're the only real class of system
that provides decent performance and
decent portability especially since the
release of invidious max-q series we can
now harness the power of GTX 1080s
inch a C's under 20 millimeters thick
I'll be it with a bit of a down clock to
keep everything in check I've been
waiting a little while to get my hands
on the slim gaming laptops I'm looking
at today so they perhaps aren't the
freshest releases of the year but to
make up for it
ASA pulled out all the stops and sent
out to predator Triton 700s one with the
GTX 1060 inside and another with the GTX
1080 max Q for us to take a look at and
a big shout out to PC case gear for
helping hook us up with these as well
check them out if you're an Aussie in
the market for a gaming laptop so a bit
of background before I get into my
thoughts on the Triton 700 if you want a
GTX 1080 max Q laptop there are only a
couple of options on the market the Zeus
ROG Zephyrus which I checked out on a
channel last year as well as the Auris
x5 MD which you can't buy now for
whatever reason and of course the Acer
predator Triton 700 and it turns out the
seuss ROG Zephyrus is a very unreliable
machine according to user reviews on
both Amazon and Newegg
a significant chunk of buyers have been
experiencing problems defects and even
dead machines I quite like this efforts
when I checked it out but with these
sort of reports out in the wild it's
hard to recommend even if it's a few
hundred dollars cheaper than the Triton
700 in North America and just on the
pricing the Triton 700 versus ROG
Zephyrus is one of the weird cases where
one model is cheaper in North America
while the other is cheaper for us
locally in Australia it's the Triton 700
that is $400 cheaper with an
eye-watering price tag of $4,300 for the
1080 max-q variant in America you can
expect to pay $3,000 so this laptop sits
right at the top of the
Shayne luckily those that want this sort
of chassis at a more affordable price
can grab the GTX 260 variant for two
thousand US or twenty seven hundred
Ozzie this is about twice the price of
the cheapest and chunky escheat x10
sixty laptops but extreme portability
has always come at a high price as
laptops like you know the razorblade are
also priced to ran this mark keep the
msi ge62 three via and gigabyte air of
fifteen in mind for cheaper options - so
before you all jump into the comments to
discuss how expensive the triton 700 is
yes it is expensive and there are
cheaper laptops with similar specs but
slim and light builds have always come
out of that hefty price tag the other
thing I wanted to talk about is the GTX
1080 max Q on a couple of other laptop
reviews I've seen comments suggesting
max Q is nothing more than Nvidia
crippling GPUs like with their previous
M series parts such as you know the gtx
980m
however while the 1080 max Q doesn't hit
the same levels of performance as the
standard 1080 it's definitely not in the
same classes than 980m
for starters the GTX 1080 max Q is the
exact same GPU as the geotech sten 80 in
larger laptops or desktops it has the
exact same cooter core count of 2560
which incidentally matches the desktop
1082 it has the exact same 8gb of gddr5
X memory a 10,000 megahertz where the
difference lies is in power and clock
speed management fully fledged e-text n
80s and laptops are equipped with beefy
coolers allowing them to read Riven at
their maximum clocks and at the maximum
TDP delivering top performance
equivalent to the desktop GPU max Q GPUs
are designed for slimmer laptops with
less capable coolers so rather than
melting the laptops in an attempt to
cool the GPU the driver
lowers the power target and less
aggressively boost the clock speed think
of it this way if you had a standard GTX
1080 went into an overclocking utility
and lowered the power target you've
essentially created the GTX 1080 max Q
Nvidia did tweak a few other things and
optimize the power delivery hardware but
the basic story is it's the same GPU
just with a lower power target and this
is the perfect excuse to look at the
perform
of the Tritons 700 in both its GTX 1060
and GTX 1080 max-q variants both systems
pack an Intel Core i7 7700 HQ CPU which
is the go-to standard for gaming laptops
along with 512 gig SSD so the 1080
models SSD is a super-fast 256 gig raid
0 array there's also 16 gig of ram to go
with the 1060 and if you get the 1080
moral you get 32 gig of ram I'm going to
completely skip the CPU testing as we
already know how the i7 7700 xq performs
and there are no surprises with either
triton 700 model instead let's hop right
into the gaming results and see how
these laptops stack up in GTA 5 the 1080
max Q model delivers excellent
performance with the 1% low result above
60 fps a 1080p ultra detail settings the
1060 model also performs well here
delivering a playable experience without
stuttering at these settings
neither laptop pulls any surprises
either falling exactly where I expected
for the hardware inside considering some
of the past systems I've looked at in
rise of the Tomb Raider it's much the
same story nothing is a huge surprise at
the maximum detail level possible only
the 1080 max Q model delivered above a
30 FPS 1% low tuning down to high
settings with the 1060 does deliver a
good experience in this title though in
Deus Ex mankind divided with the ultra
preset at 1080p the 1080 max q2 of his
fantastic results once again while the
1060 is better suited to the high preset
here it's interesting to note that the
1080 max Q isn't that far ahead of the
GTX 1070 outperforming it by just 11%
though that's a similar story across
most of the tests hitman is an
interesting result because the Triton
700 with the 1080 max Q doesn't reach
the same average performance as the
Zephyrus but it is outperforming it on
1% Louis both systems are quite capable
in this game using the DirectX 12 mode
with ultra details I like to keep
testing with watch dogs too because it's
so punishing on both the CPU and GPU
most laptops struggle in this game with
the ultra preset although the GTX 1080
max Q Triton 700 does a respectable job
of keeping the 1%
frame rate above 30 the GTX 1060 model
on the other hand performs well for a
laptop with this GPU but could do with a
few setting reductions not going to
spend a lot of time discussing Mass
Effect Andromeda as is both mediocre
game and runs well and most laptop
hardware the GTX 1080 max Q model pushes
well above 60 FPS on average while the
1060 variant still delivers a decent
experience here nothing out of the
ordinary for either of these GPUs in
prey the GTX 1080 max Q model exceeded
my expectation C and actually
outperforms the zephyrus by a fair
margin I would say a recent driver
update has given this tile a nice boost
compared to some of the laptops I tested
earlier Middle Earth shadow of war
benefits from the GTX 1080 max Q's extra
power allowing a 1% low result of above
50 FPS using the ultra preset while the
GTX 1060 is stuck pushing just over a 30
FPS 1% low with that said the game runs
really well on the high preset - without
sacrificing much visual quality so as
I've mentioned a few times both GPUs
perform pretty much exactly as I
expected in the Triton 700 the GTX 1080
max Q model is typically around 45%
faster than the GTX 1060 model when
looking at the all-important 1% low
results when comparing the Triton 700s
to other similar laptops with this
Hardware inside the GTX 1080 max Q model
is basically identical in performance to
the rog zephyrus on average there's a
bit more variance among the gtx 1060
models in some games but again on
average you're getting roughly the same
experience from the triton 700 as other
gtx 1060 laptops a couple of other
interesting things to note about these
laptops the 1080 max q variant uses a
blazing-fast 256 gig raid 0 array which
produces outstanding sequential
performance and decent random speeds the
GTX 1060 model though isn't as
impressive compared to other 1060 gaming
laptops that include much faster single
SSDs considering the premium price point
of the 1060 variant this sort of
performance is a little disappointing
it's also a bit disappointing to see the
1080 max Q model getting a superior
display both are 15.6 inch 1080
Bips LCDs but it's only the 1080 max
queue that gets a 120 Hertz refresh rate
and gsync again considering the price of
these laptops I'd have liked to see the
same display in both models sure that
the 1080 max queue is more likely to use
the higher refresh rate but premium
laptops should include the best hardware
possible the interesting thing about
both triton 700 miles is they both use
the same cooling solution in the case of
the GTX 1080 max queue the cooler has to
handle somewhere around a hundred watts
of GPU power while the GTX 1060 you know
it's only happening to cool about 65
watts or so this should give a thermal
and noise advantage to the GTX 1060
model during gaming and looking at these
results it does at least in regards to
the thermals while playing watchdogs to
the CPU and GPU both set at 6 degrees
Celsius cooler after 30 minutes while
noise levels work the same 42 DBA from
50 centimeters away neither system is
particularly loud there is a slight
high-pitched winch to the cooler but it
can be easily drowned out with game
audio the GTX 1060 does have a bit more
headroom for either overclocking or
running at a quieter level while the GTX
1080 max-q model runs close to the
limits of this thermal solution as for
design both Triton 700 miles are
identical and like this efforts this is
a design that has the keyboard along the
front edge which is a bit unconventional
but it allows the upper area to be used
entirely for cooling it does mean the
trackpad is relocated to an odd glass
area above the keyboard which is one of
the weirdest trackpad placements I've
seen the track pad itself performs well
but the position is too awkward for all
but the most occasional use you'll
definitely need to use an external mouse
with this laptop for the best results
continuing the list of unusual aspects
the Triton 700 the keyboard uses very
clicky key caps I think they're trying
to imitate the feel of a mechanical
keyboard with a loud click but it
doesn't quite work and in stuff just
feeling like the click is masking the
usual rubber don't mush it's not a bad
keyboard though it perhaps doesn't live
up to the billing as a true mechanical
keyboard
so the general build quality acer has
done a fantastic job here using a
combination of metal and plastic the
fuels neither cheap not over-the-top
with game elements the competing asou
Sepphoris uses a nice design too but I
wasn't as sold on the separating based
power or Seuss's more gamer aesthetic in
this regard I like what else was done
with the Triton 700 a lot more safe for
the keyboard and trackpad oddities the
Triton 700 is also reasonably portable
and just 19 millimeters thick and 2.4
kilos heavy it's not as light as the
razor blade does eros or the MSI tier 63
VR but I would take a bit of extra heft
for the superior build quality and
especially compared to the race of blade
better cooling capacity all the standard
i/o is on this machine including gigabit
ethernet full hdmi and displayport
Thunderbolt 3 and multiple audio jacks
this is identical in both models and I
especially like the inclusion of
DisplayPort so you can easily attach
external monitors and get the full
benefits of features like g-sync
so at the end of the day the reason why
I wanted to look at the triton 700 is
that I'm searching for the ultimate
portable gaming laptop machines like the
msi ge62 3 vr gigabyte air of 15 and
razorblade either have loud coolers or
top out adjust gtx 1070 max cues the
asou severus as i mentioned earlier in
this review has reliability problems and
suffers from a few strange design
choices the ace of Predator Triton 700
with the GTX 10 80 max Q is the closest
to perfection I've seen you get
excellent performance typically 40 to 60
percent ahead of the GTX 1060 and 20 to
35 percent faster than the GTX 970 max Q
both of which are more commonly used in
this sort of form factor the screen is
exactly what you want with this hardware
providing 120 Hertz refresh and gsync
the build quality is fantastic as well
with a decent selection of Io and the
included raid 0 SSD is blazing fast but
it's not perfect
achieving better build quality has led
to a heavier system than its competitors
the trackpad is in a very strange and
impractical location the keyboard is
marketer's mechanical but it doesn't
live up to that discreet
and the cooler is basically right on its
limits on top of all of this at nearly
three thousand US dollars it's also a
very expensive proposition for most
buyers I think we may see some of these
issues addressed in second gen max-q
laptops though if you want to jump in
right now and get the best-performing
portable gaming laptop on the market
it's the predator triton 700 with 1080
max-q you should be looking at
especially considering the competition
the GTX 1060 model is a harder sell at
it's $2,000 price point there's nothing
inherently wrong with the gaming
performance thermals or builds but the
msi gt80
the gigabyte Aero 15 should also be in
consideration with its slim bezel design
calibrator display and again lower price
but huge shout out once again to PC case
