two of our monthly Q&amp;amp;A i've got my
trusty sidekick yeah Tim here with me so
what have we got more questions on yeah
well we definitely have filmed the first
half of the questions before making this
intro so we're definitely sure that it
is the second the second half of ITX
questions so you've been for more g4
stuff I reckon let's get into it okay
next question considering the whole
lineup of 20 series graphics cards will
be available sometime around the end of
the year do you think it is worth
waiting for Navi that's AMD's Navi
especially for people thinking about the
2060 or lower what do you reckon I mean
it's one of those typical answers like
if you can afford to wait then I suppose
wait it's always a thing like do I wait
or do I not wait because you can always
just keep waiting for the next thing and
we haven't even the GeForce 20 series
hasn't even released yet we're sort of
suggesting waiting but honestly if it
was me and your shoes and I desperately
I didn't desperately need a graphics
card rather I wouldn't spend the money
because don't part with the money unless
you absolutely need to I don't know what
graphics card you're gaming with now
having said that like who knows how long
it'll be till we see these new seven
nanometer GPUs from Nvidia and AMD next
year pretty certain it will be next year
and that being the case it does make it
a bit hard to spend big right now on 12
millimeter tech when I mean I'm
confident are you confident that we'll
be getting seven nanometers next year
yep and or even if it what TSM see seven
enemy or even if you say it's like what
ten nanometers comparable to what Intel
will be doing you that's still a massive
improvement for 12 nanometers which is
essentially 60 nanometers get to be
confusing all this in any case it's
going to be a big big leap similar to
what we saw from Maxwell to Pascal
I would think yep so I would save my
money and wait for that and see how that
goes
if you can if not maybe grab a second
hand Pascal card like we've been talking
about - and
a few other questions all right most of
the improvements for the 20 series cards
are mostly focused on ray tracing and
not much of a jump on FPS also when can
we expect an official announcement for
Intel's I $9.99 hundred K and i7 9700 a
yeah I think you spoke a bit about this
again in the announcement video I think
we both share the same sort of opinions
a bit of a smokescreen potentially to
hide the fact that 12 nanometer isn't
that much of a step forward compared to
what they were using for 16 nanometer
with Pascal so yeah they're basically
they've just made a bigger GPU with
cheering and added in you know RT and
ten circles which while it's will be
great for people doing compute workloads
probably won't be used in games or at
least a significant amount of games for
quite a few generations probably bit of
speculation on our part but even just
seeing the list of games that are using
RT X features it's it's not not even
half of like the the major releases
coming out in the next 6 to 12 months so
yeah I mean it's definitely paving the
way for the future because you need to
introduce these things to get the
features get the ball rolling that sort
of thing but where the future I just
don't necessarily want gamers to pay
through the nose for yeah nothing like
that's probably paying a bit bit more
than you would otherwise expect for that
sort of thing for 9900 K though that
should be pretty soon but we don't have
any info on that all right there's a bit
of a long question this has been asked a
lot but I want an answer for a content
creator student digital animation mayor
blend all that sort of thing I've been
waiting to upgrade my GPU will it be
worth it to get one of the new RT X
models or is a GT X 10 series for a
lower price a better option although
it's really tough in Chile because the
market is bad yet kind of sucks the
South America markets are apparently
really horrendous for pricing yeah
yeah I mean for these sort of workloads
for your content craze it really will
depend whether the app that you're using
is going to take advantage of those
chewing features so you know you might
get a pretty significant performance
improvement for things like ray tracing
if you are running an app that will
support the arty cause and the tenser
cause and all that sort of thing
ensuring but if not then you're way
better off or at least it looks like you
would be significantly better off with
Pascale from a value for performance
perspective so yeah unless you're able
to take advantage of the shrink features
then yeah probably better off with
Pascale
I think so all right we'll the 2060 and
2050 cards feature ray tracing or they
just be a performance upgrade from the
supposed previous generation so yeah do
they will they support ray tracing or is
it just a raster yeah I think I think
either yeah I think the rumors are
suggesting there will be gtx cards so
they won't include the arty cause I mean
obviously to save money a really easy
way would be to either deactivate or
just make a GP that doesn't have the
arty cause it'll be in the testing for
sure so yeah it seems pretty unlikely
that those cards will feature ray
tracing so that would just be something
you won't be able to run yeah and
probably just mostly a performance
upgrade however large they managed to
but even then I think something like
that 2070 has a fairly significantly
lower amount of arty performance
compared to the top-end card so even
that is gonna it's a forty years a
trouble yeah forty percent less I mean
from some of those you know captures
that we've seen of the twenty a DTI
running race racing it seems like that
card is getting worked pretty hard to do
ray tracing so with 40% less something
like the 27 he's gonna struggle yeah I
mean it's early rushed implementations
of the technology and the games we've
seen that said it uses it quite heavily
to make the effect look amazing and you
know wow factor yeah it'll be used to a
much lesser degree and as we spoke of I
believe in a question earlier I think it
was the patron livestream they'll
probably be like some sort of slider bar
in the setting year to the degree of you
can enable ray tracing so you know 28
ETA you might slide it more that way
from 1070 2070 sorry say that's so much
1070 and 2070 but again that's not as
bad as the RT X and GTX but anyway yeah
I don't think you got
see those technologies and the lower end
cards yeah maybe the next-gen alright
Steve this is a question that we've been
getting a lot um well will you give us
some benchmarks of the VRTX cards uh
well we don't even know actually it was
quite funny we were doing our patron
livestream before and we were saying to
the guys we don't know if it's going to
be on the day that the pre-orders ship
or a week before but apparently there's
an NDA floating around the moment the
date is was the 14th of September if a
member maybe yeah I don't know if that's
right
it could be we haven't even signed an
NDA so not sure what's going on there at
the moment we yeah I would have to say
or I have to assume that we will have
benchmarks short at least shortly after
you can physically buy them because if
we don't have one buy them we will be
buying one but hopefully we'll have one
well in event so we can do all planned
your benchmarks certainly not for a few
weeks you won't be getting benchmarks
though no definitely not at least two
weeks from now next question this is
funny can Tim actually get mad how do
you use this well yeah we were reading
through a lot of the fake rumors of the
gtx 1180 which turned out to be that 20
80 just before on the patreon livestream
so I think Tim was getting a little bit
triggered by some of those so I think if
I made him read through every rumor
surrounding what is now the GeForce 20
series I think that'd that'd send him to
a slight tinge of green a bit of bit of
Hulk rage but anything else that upsets
you triggers you beyond eyes it's just
that just that that's just just fake
Romans get too upset makes news corner
really difficult so that's probably why
he yeah alright I'll power through this
question because it's like quite a few
of the ones we've had
I bought a GTX 1070 a couple of months
ago and I'm very happy with it good
stuff
do you think I'm missing out by not
having waited for the RT X series or am
I better off having avoided it honestly
I think you've probably done the right
thing because you sounds like you bought
the card at a time when the prices that
just come down from their crazy level so
you go
a good time and honestly the way it's
looking at the moment again pure
speculation on our behalf but I think
Pascal owners will have very little to
upgrade to with cheering I would say
that they're best off skipping cheering
and waiting for the seven nanometer
technology that will come next year okay
rusty asks do you think the performance
game from Pascal tutoring will be
similar to that of Kepler to Maxwell ie
the GTX 980 has fewer CUDA cores in the
780 Ti but outperforms it it's possible
that cheering will pull away a little
bit over time so I think we did see that
with the 980 and 780 Ti though the 782 I
did come back a bit it seemed like there
was a bit of weirdness going on there
with the drivers but anyway with driver
optimization it's certainly possible
that the Turing GPUs will pull away
further especially if they can sort of
take advantage of the RT and hence the
cause for your particular comparison
it's a bit difficult though it's and
it's certainly a different situation
because while the 780ti did have 40%
more CUDA cores and that is certainly a
lot more cause it had 33 percent less
ROPS and the criticals themselves were
clocked 20% higher on the 980 so just
the standard 980 so less cause but more
ops and everything was clocked higher
for the cosmic clock tire so that gives
the 980 a much greater a pixel fill rate
it was about 70 percent greater I
believe so that's why it ended up being
a better gaming GPU okay short sweet
question I 580 400 or r5 2600 for
streaming slash recording Tim's going to
delve into this topic soon on the
channel I think yeah I think though this
is a pretty quick answer to this one
yeah you you're better off with the rise
in 520 600 the 8400 struggles barely 6
threads yep definitely alright this is a
pretty long question but I think a lot
of people are wondering about this so
I'll sit and relax
so MFM art asks what is with the demos
being rendered in 1080p on the show
floor and why are there so many
different reviews on their experience at
the show a German site showed Tomb
Raider getting low frames and I didn't
produce the show poor rendering but
TechRadar published the early opinion
review stating the opposite shortly we
have to assume that drivers and
optimizations is simply not there yet
and the video simply wants to
demonstrate that it is possible not that
it is finished that being said not quite
sure what to expect with deep learning I
get the functionality for DL SS but what
other applications could we see can a I
help in ray-tracing workloads or
something like in a physics like
capacity so lots to break down there
lots so let's first talk about the demos
what is with the demos being rated in
1080p well basically because it seems
like the 20 atti
running that particular demo is
fluctuating between like 30 to 50 fps at
1080p with race racing enabled so takes
1440p out of the question
yeah okay so that's why it's being
winded at 1080p as for why different
websites came up with different opinions
I think most people have Illustrated the
low frame rate some yeah I've seen
pretty much the same opinion yeah I did
see the was at the tech report tech
radar check radar sorry sorry tech
report and yet tech rate review yeah was
a title was a review a preview I can't
remember the URL had reviewing it yeah I
thought it is well so that's bizarre
very bizarre stuff if they said review
because yeah a preview at best but I
think some people with these things like
it depends whether you're more sensitive
to visual effects or whether you're more
sensitive to performance well because
you could come out saying well the
effects are really good and completely
ignore performance and other people will
just be focused on it running it like 30
FPS on a flagship card so just depends
yeah if you take ways it works yeah it
just works yes sorry that's what it's
supposed to be other thing for drivers
and optimizations
yeah it does seem like it is a fairly
early implementation I still think
ray-tracing will tank performance pretty
hard considering how intensive it is to
run on anything
it's very computationally intensive so
the optimization will be doing it less
yeah so there will certainly be some
optimization for being you know an early
product but
yeah what else have you got here what
else could we expect from deep learning
aside from DSS I think the deep learning
stuff already helps with ray tracing to
like do some post-processing on it to
sort of smooth out some artifacts I
think that was already a feature of the
tensor cause yeah actually yeah I'm not
doing some cleanup work for the right
now I think not I was not sure on that
alarm for other things there's there is
the potential and there has been some
reports suggesting that some post
effects features could be offloaded to
the tents of course but we'll see
whether that requires you know game
support whether that it can just be
automatically done' what the case is
like there so yeah I think there's
there's certainly potential there for
all those extra processing features of
this GPU to do stuff but it might take
quite a while for different games and
game mentions to actually use it that
was a thought I had when you're reading
the question out it's I think that was
the part where we were sort of talking
about you know the software's not
develops not optimized
okay sure the cards are coming out next
month will we have any examples of ray
tracing that we use for benchmarking in
games well we have more than one when
will we have a really good example yeah
might vary significantly
yeah between games by the end of this
generation how well will we have taken
advantage of it yeah who knows listen so
does it pack enough articles to even be
really useful
I don't think so personally that's just
mine yes could be turned out to be
completely wrong anyway blown out okay
this is a short and sweet one can
ray-tracing be something that can have
some functions offload the CPU seeing
that we now have high core count CPUs
pretty basic answer this one no ray
tracing is a way to computationally
intensive to run on a CPU yep okay next
question will AMD also come up with some
super revolutionary high oh sorry
lighting caused on their GPUs to compete
with Nvidia and their ray-tracing
marketing hype bs
Wow yeah I'm sure I think we might have
mentioned this earlier on a different
question who knows I'm sure Amy will
also introduce you no hardware
accelerated rate racing in a future
architecture especially as ray-tracing
is actually being implemented through DX
I think I mentioned this earlier which
is DirectX ray-tracing that's vendor
agnostic it's not any video specific
thing obviously because it's DirectX and
in videos developed r-tx for their ray
tracing stuff and that's it's under D X
R so basically if it game accesses DX r
DXi passes it off to RTX a lot of
acronyms there but that's kind of the
chain down towards the GPU so basically
AMD could develop like a RT x sort of
equivalent for their hardware so I'm
sure I'm pretty confident that will
happen at some point
definitely yeah okay we've got a
question here for Tim from a rebel devil
2000 who is one of our patreon members
so this is from our discord chat hey Tim
I got to thinking about laptops and how
high-end devices always have high TDP
and in turn lower battery life but
phones have the interesting set up of
eight cores for low-power ones and for
performance ones do you think something
like that would be feasible in a laptop
or in the laptop market for more
efficient battery life especially if
Snapdragon on Windows becomes more
widely adopted well that's a pretty
interesting question that when I'm
interested here so I think the reason
why we seen that setup of for low-power
cores and for performance cause on smart
phones is that smart phones do a lot of
stuff in the background like you'll be
even though when your apps apart it
still has to you know process all sorts
of things to get your messages in just
to run all that sort of thing you might
be playing music with your phone in your
pocket you know that uses processing
power and all that sort of thing so the
reason why they have those low power
causes if you're only running a low
power task or if your phone is idling or
whatever it can fully shut off those
performance cause just use the low power
cores for those background tasks but on
a laptop I think a lot of the time you
know those the tasks you might be doing
it mostly would be sort of mourn the
performance in something like running
Chrome
latency problem or might not benefit as
much from having low power cords
especially because you know there's
noise noise main background tasks
obviously windows itself is a background
task if you're just idling I think a lot
of people would just have their laptop
go to sleep and then turn it on and use
all your performance tasks so that's one
reason why I don't think that would be
as useful in laptops but also modern x86
processors have a very different way
that they sort of implement low-power
you know core gating and all that sort
of thing already exists so with you know
smartphones they do some of these things
as well but Intel process and ami
processes have much more advanced
methods of down clocking or clocking up
really really fast
clocking CPU cores at different clock
speeds power gating cause entirely and
that's not fully implemented on
smartphones if so when those low power
cores of performance course can have a
bit more benefit so yeah I personally I
don't really see it happening but yeah I
wouldn't make sense I don't think you
know basically with your laptop the
point is to get the job done as quickly
as possible and sort of a maximum amount
of efficiency let's say yeah where it
makes sense get it done and then go to a
title stay yeah whereas with phones all
those background tasks that it's good to
have those cores you can offload
- and especially as well you know what
are those low-power slash performance
cause actually use different
architectures for the cause mmm was I
think you know these come you tell an
AME apart from heavy atom until I guess
they just use the one basic architecture
and then get it to scale up and down as
much as possible so I gave it's probably
bit logistical II difficult for some of
these companies to develop something
like that alright so we've finally
gotten through two whole videos now with
the Q&amp;amp;A questions probably on exactly
the same thing on the RT X card so
that's been a bit of fun answering those
over the past hour so thanks to everyone
that submitted questions and yeah if you
missed part one obviously go back and
watch that if you haven't already be a
bit of a bit of a madman to watch part 2
before part 1 I reckon I mean April were
just crazy there's some people that will
do that for sure as always don't forget
to like the video if you enjoy our Q&amp;amp;A
and I think we have we have some cool
stuff in a patron at the moment we've
just done a live stream
well don't film this but yeah we had two
live streams this month for the patreon
so it's plenty reason to sign up over
there and get access to our exclusive
discord chat as well so it's all fun and
games over there I guess we'll catch you
the next one so your next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
