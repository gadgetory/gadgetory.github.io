are checking out how the intel core oh
nine ninety nine hundred k performs when
paired with ddr4 four thousand memory
this is a test that quite a few of you
have been requesting for some time now
I've been a bit slack but I've got my
hands on some four thousand memory and
it's around here somewhere I'll find at
the moment doesn't really matter but
anyway I've put it to the test
I've actually done a bit more than just
test with just the four thousand speed
it's more of a suppose you call it a
memory scaling benchmark this one I've
tested a number of games and
applications at memory speeds ranging
from twenty four hundred which is just
below spec of course twenty 666 which is
the spec right up to four thousand
there's about eight memory speeds in
total so yeah lots of interesting
results to go over but before we do
today's video has been sponsored by
asrock and then you phantom gaming range
of zero ninety motherboards the Zed 390
phantom gaming six and nine include a
blazing fast 2.5 gigabits per second
network interface offering gamers and
content creators two and a half times
the bandwidth compared to standard
Gigabit Ethernet for more information
please check the link in the video
description ok so over the past month
I've noticed quite a few viewers asking
us to run some tests on the nine ROK
using ddr4 4000 memory I've also noticed
quite a few people interested in memory
scaling as they can work out where the
sweet spot is in terms of memory
frequency so I thought why not just do
both at once kill two birds with the
ones to commemorate as a say G skill
recently sent over a 16 gigabyte kit of
their Trident Z royal ddr4 memory
I haven't actually taken the plastic off
these ones anyway this is or these
modules rather are rated at the 4000
speed using CL 17 timings that's
probably shining all over the place I
should be careful where I aim these
anyway so for this test I will be taking
as Rox
Zed 390 Taichi ultimate gigabytes RT X
20 80 TI horas extreme the night are ok
of course and then G skills bullying
fest memory that could potentially blind
people depending on the angle that I aim
this stuff on anyway we
see how that impacts performance at a
range of clock frequencies in total
there are eight memory configurations
all of which use the same CL 17 timing
so we're really just looking at the
difference that the memory speed or
memory frequency has here the 99er okay
isn't overclocked but that won't really
impact the results and yeah I think
that's about everything so let's get
into those blue bar graphs before we get
into the games of which there are just a
few let's go over some memory bandwidth
results and then check out a couple of
applications looking at the I 264 read
bandwidth results we see that the
increase in memory speed translates to a
similar percentage gain for example ddr4
2666
is clocked 11% higher than ddr4 2400 and
we saw a 12 percent boost in memory
bandwidth the margin of error is likely
responsible for that extra percent then
we see from 20 666 to 3,000 it's a
twelve and a half percent frequency bump
and the bandwidth is increased by eleven
and a half percent this kind of scaling
is pretty much seen right up to the 4000
spec it's not quite as efficient but
some decent scaling is seen at the high
end
typically I test Intel processors with
ddr4 3200 memory though it's l14 stuff
and that allows for a bandwidth of
roughly 50 gigabytes per second in this
test so somewhere between CL 17 ddr4
3400 and 3600 then still with ddr4 4000
there is a 12% memory bandwidth increase
to be had so it will be interesting to
see what kind of impact this has on
performance before we jump into the
application benchmarks here's just
another quick look at some memory
bandwidth results though this time I
will be using sigh soft sound of 2016
memory bandwidth test a 264 reports the
peak bandwidth whereas I soft reports
sustained bandwidth overall though
despite the numbers being lower the
margins are much the same as we found in
the past memory bandwidth doesn't impact
3d rendering applications all that much
and once again we see that here with
Cinebench r15 going all the way from
ddr4 2400 to ddr4 4000 boosted the score
by just 2% a measly 2% increase there
it's a similar story when testing with
blender here the ddr4 4000 memory
reduced the rendering time by just one
point four percent shaving just 10
seconds off the completion time when
compared to ddr4 2400 so despite an
almost 60
increase in memory bandwidth less than a
trooper settlements boost was seen the
merchants are ever so slightly better in
Corona
but even so for those running rendering
applications the increased bandwidth
really isn't required this is one of the
reasons why the thread group of twenty
nine ninety WX does so well in these
rendering applications typically this is
a CPU that's bound with staff with all
caused active but in the rendering
applications that bandwidth intensive it
does do very well that said we also see
when encoding that the extra memory
bandwidth isn't that useful though it is
substantially more useful when compared
to what we just saw in the rendering
applications ddr4 4000 offers a seven
percent boost over the twenty four
hundred stuff far from impressive but
like I said it's better than a two
percent boost that we saw in the
rendering applications for those of you
who regularly compress archives or files
the increased memory bandwidth will be
greatly appreciated we basically see
perfect scaling here for almost sixty
percent increase in bandwidth we see an
almost 60 percent increase in
performance when going from ddr4 24
hundred to four thousand still as good
as the compression performance was when
it comes to decompression work the
increased memory bandwidth is next to
useless we're back to single digit gains
here okay so enough applications time
for a few quick game benchmarks and
first up we have Strange Brigade a well
optimized title that mostly taxes the
GPU it's not at all a CPU demanding
title so I wasn't surprised to find that
the increased memory bandwidth had
little impact on performance the one
percent low frame time performance is
slightly improved as the RAM frequency
is ramped up but it's certainly nothing
to write home about and with just a 3%
increase in performance from ddr4 3,000
to 4,000 you just get the cheaper stuff
that said trying out any more CPU
demanding title such as the NPC heavy
hitman 2 provides us with slightly more
favorable results for the higher clocked
memory that said even here ddr4 4000 was
just 14 percent faster than ddr4 3000
we're looking at frame time performance
I'd say ddr4 3400 looks to be the sweet
spot here and I'd say the CL 14 ddr4
3200 memory and typically use provides
marginally better results one of the
most demanding tiles of 2018 we shut off
the Tomb Raider and here we find pretty
solid gains right up to ddr4
thirty eight hundred at least when
looking at the frame time performance
overall I'd say ddr4 3400 is the sweet
spot while the 3600 result would be
comparable to the low latency 3,200
memory the real performance it comes
when using ddr4 2400 which is below the
official spec while 2666
is the official spec in fact anything
slower than ddr4 3200 using sales 17
timings really does leave a lot of
performance on the table at least 29
Tech's 20 atti at this resolution using
these quality settings and I'll address
that in a moment okay so here's the last
gaming benchmark when I look at
battlefield 5 and what we have here is
another CPU demanding title here at
1080p we continue to see performance
gains as the memory frequency is
increased though ddr4 3400 does once
again appear to be the sweet spot while
frame time performance I really did drop
off with ddr4 3000 but so far I've only
tested at 1080p with an RT x20 atti so
what does memory scaling performance
look like at what I suppose you would
call a more realistic resolution for
such a beastly GPU well at 1080p we saw
a 34 percent improvement in frame time
performance when going from ddr4 2400 to
4000 and now at 1440p that margin is
reduced to just 7% so yeah quite a
change there we really are reaching the
point of diminishing returns with I'd
say ddr4 3200 then if you plan to play
at the 4k resolution with the RT X xx
atti well you don't really need to worry
about memory speed it basically has zero
impact on performance here you're
entirely GPU limited even in a taxing
title such as battlefield 5 ok so there
you have it memory scaling performance
with the Intel Core i $9.99 hundred K in
short for most applications in games
memory speed as it'll impact I granted
you don't want to be running below spec
with ddr4 2400 memory we just included
that out of interest
I'd say the sweet spot somewhere between
3,000 to 3,400 3,500 would certainly be
sufficient even with looser timings for
16 gigabytes of ddr4 4000 memory you're
looking at having to spend at least $220
us meanwhile ddr4 3000 memory starts at
just under half that value and for
one hundred and twenty dollars u.s. you
can land yourself a CL 16 ddr4 3200 kit
if you're a game of the battlefield five
1440p results are probably the most
telling this is the kind of scaling you
can typically expect to see for example
if you have a gtx 10:17 you're playing
at 1080p you'll see very similar memory
scaling results then outside of gaming
it becomes very application dependent
and even then and what you're doing if
the application can also determine how
useful the extra memory bandwidth really
is it seems like for 3d rendering and
encoding work the extra bandwidth goes
largely unused but again you will want
to research how memory bandwidth impact
your particular workload overall as I
said just a moment ago I recommend ddr4
3000 to 3400 as that stuff really is
going to provide you with the most bang
for your buck while anything faster as
we saw is likely going to end up being a
waste of money under realistic gaming
conditions maybe some scenarios where
it's beneficial but I think for the most
part and most of you won't be able to
take advantage of it typically for
around a hundred 240 dollars you're
looking at cell 16 a CL 17 memory again
we tested with cell 17 stuff in this
video and as was the case with frequency
spending big to get low latency memory
you know CL 15 CL 14 possibly even lower
it's not really going to be worth it I
will just quickly before I wrap this up
a bit of a fun look back at the start of
2018 I made a video series called why
building a gaming PC right now is a bad
idea it's quite a depressing time there
for PC gamers and part one talked about
ddr4 memory prices which along with
pretty much everything else was sky-high
at the time so back in January the
cheapest 16 gigabyte ddr4 kit that I was
able to find online cost a hundred and
seventy dollars u.s. so today we're
looking at basically half that fear so
yeah it's fair to say prices have
dropped they may not have dropped as low
as we would like but they've definitely
dropped and I did predict in January of
2018 that it would be about this time
that we would see memory prices start to
drop back down towards what we'd seen in
2017 so yeah seems I've got a bit lucky
on that call this means you probably
shouldn't expect ddr4 memory pricing to
fall anytime soon certainly not too much
later in the year the construction of
new
is underway to help the strained supply
but they won't be ready for mass
production until 2019 at the earliest
that's predicted by Gartner that DDR for
pricing will crash in 2019 history would
suggest this is likely to happen as it's
the sort of cycle we go through every
few years with memory pricing and with
that I am going to end this one I hope
