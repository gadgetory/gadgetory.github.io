week we talked about a number of issues
we felt Intel customers would like to
see them address and in the face of
growing competition from AMD they should
certainly consider a few of them issues
such as platform compatibility the
underwhelming Box cooler and then the
massive separation between the base and
boost clocks which sees the TDP rating
now abused and of course there were many
more at the end of that video I noted
that we would be targeting AMD next and
talked about areas where the red team
can do better and well this is that
video as the current underdog AMD has
more reason to play nice they've been
forced into doing many of the things
that we've been asking Intel to do
simply because of their much smaller
market share so as I said in the Intel
version of this video we don't believe a
laser st. not by any stretch of the
imagination it's still a big company
trying to achieve all the things that
big companies set out to achieve
basically make as much money as possible
if you do miss part one which focused on
Intel I recommend you go and watch that
video first I'll provide a link in the
video description or as a pinned comment
but to quickly summarize the series a
few weeks ago tell myself we're over in
Taiwan attending the Computex trade show
and we found ourselves discussing quite
a few areas where Intel AMD and NVIDIA
need to improve to become more consumer
friendly and at the end of that
discussion we thought would actually
make for a pretty good video series
since we've already tackled the big one
Intel it's time to talk about AMD and
while there really isn't that much to
discuss on the CPU front we also have a
few GPU related things that we can talk
about I'll talk about each point that
was raised and please note that none of
this is in any particular order some
things will be more important than
others again we're just looking at this
from the perspective of a consumer so
let's get into it
in our what intel needs to fix video we
mentioned that intel uses a pretty
useless TDP metric that people often
confuse for power consumption the TDP
rating only refers to the heat
dissipation required to run the CPU at
its base clocks which makes a little
sense in the world where CPUs frequently
run it well above the base clock for
maximum performance well ambi are gonna
be left with hook either their TDP
trading also makes a little sense and
only serves to confuse buyers and
enthusiasts at least in our opinion how
AMD calculates the TDP is different
Intel but like with Intel's TDP it only
vaguely relates to power consumption and
isn't really a good reflection of how
much power a modern processor uses
during actual operation and because it
isn't a good reflection of power
consumption it's really not a good
metric for deciding how be for your
cooler needs to be AMD's exact
definition of the TDP is the maximum
power a processor can draw for a
thermally significant period while
running commercially useful software
that's just a meaningless statement that
allows AMD to effectively choose
whatever TDP they like the end result is
a risin 7 2700 and risin 3 1300 X that
have the same TDP even though one is an
8 core CPU clocked up to 4 point 1
gigahertz and the other is a quad core
clocked of 3.7 gigahertz it doesn't make
any logical sense that both CPUs would
have the exact same TDP and looking at
the actual power consumption figures for
each processor it's quite clear that
2700 does consume a lot more power it's
true that AMD's TDP does seem to fall
closer to a real-world power consumption
but it's still such a useless metric for
everyday PC builders aimed you should
provide an actual power consumption
metric that allows everyone at easily
compare processors particularly for
higher-end CPUs that make it so much
easier to know how much power is
dissipated when running the CPUs highest
possible performance level so that way
you can go and buy a cooler that meets
the
spec
okay so this one was a bit cheeky funny
at first but now it's just becoming a
bit childish confusing I suppose even
frustrating for potential buyers again
AMD are the underdogs they were coming
into this fight an extreme disadvantage
with horizon so we can kind of
understand why they decided to copy
Intel's naming schemes personally I
would have preferred aimed E to be smart
about the naming and call the quad-core
rise in parts rise and fall for example
and then the eight core parts Verizon
eight then give the SMT enabled models
the X suffix for example instead though
they copied the core i3 i5 and i7 doming
with the rise in three five and seven
but we don't really have too much of an
issue with that
the big problem has been the chipset
naming the X 370 and X 417 chipsets are
ok they're different enough from Intel
Zed series such as the Zed 370 for
example I'm still a little confusing but
it's not too bad
the be 350 in our be 450 chipset names
are you know they're quite unfortunate
the B series from Intel was meant to be
their business range though it's now
somehow just become a gaming thing and
with the 100 and 200 series we just have
the B 150 and be 250 chipsets AMD beat
Intel to the punch with B 350 so in
total decided to one-up them and release
a B 360 chipset so now we have B 150 250
and 360 from Intel with B 350 from AMD
there was a strong rumour that AMD would
be releasing AZ 490 chipset around the
same time intelligent expected to
release the Zed 390 chipset but
thankfully it seems those plans have
been canceled still the popular B series
is extremely confusing especially for
those that don't live and breathe PC
tech I have heard from a few people who
build a new PC every two to three years
that have purchased a B 360 board
thinking that it will work with their
rise in CPU or vice versa bought a be
350 board thinking it would work with a
coffee like CPU some of you might say
well that's a stupid mistake to make but
again if you're only building a PC every
few years and you hear that a B 350
board is the best value for your eyes
and CPU it's conceivable that you might
accidentally order a b3 61
anyway trolling Intel was a bit of fun
quite amusing but I think it's time to
get serious now
so as you consume up we want chipset
names to be a lot less confusing maybe
aim dica ghosts with something like our
450 and our 470 as an example that that
would be much clearer
okay Sophia missed it but given the
views you probably didn't her back in
early May I created a video titled why
AMD superior compatibility could end and
it's all your fault
basically I talked about how AMD was
copying a lot of flak from inexperienced
system builders who ran into troubles
with outdated be 350 or X 370 boards and
by outdated I mean they were using an
older bias that didn't support the new
second generation CPUs in summary I
concluded by saying that this wasn't
AMD's fault those complaining simply
need to accept the fact that they were
taking on the role as the PC technician
it was really up to them to make sure
that the motherboard have the
appropriate BIOS however I did state
that one or AMD's fault after all they
did ensure continued compatibility while
Intel continues to accident or a year or
two it the most there are things
AMD could do to help things more
practical and financially viable than
their boot kit band-aid what we as
consumers would like to see is aimed at
working with their board partners so you
know MSI asrock gigabyte and a sous for
example and work with those guys to
implement a Rison BIOS flashback feature
a feature that would allow motherboards
bars to be updated without needing the
correct CPU to boot it up in fact you
wouldn't need a CPU at all although this
one is more on the board partners aim B
could certainly get involved to make
sure this is a feature that's
implemented on all a m4 and tr4
motherboards the good news is it seems
that board makers are starting a wise up
for example we saw at Computex that all
future MSI AMD boards will support a
bias flashback feature even at the very
cheapest boards hopefully AMD will nudge
all their board partners into making
this a standard rise and feature
something AMD needs to improve rather
than fix is the integrated memory
controller or IMC for short some decent
steps were made with second gen Rison
but there's still a bit of work to be
done and we're sure AMD is well aware of
that memory frequency is still quite
limited and we've also found that you
still do require a good ship to hit 3400
and beyond things do get even worse if
you plan to fully populate your
motherboards DIMM slots for memory
modules will likely force you down to a
lower speed than that of two modules
memory compatibility is still somewhat
limited as well though we realize that
the rise in processors have only been on
the market for about a year and a half
now and support for the platform is
improving all the time still we would
like to see Andy continue improve ddr4
memory compatibility in the short term
long term they will transition a DDR 5
and then we'll start this all over again
there AMD will be starting from a much
better position
like the IMC of the rise and cps that we
just spoke of I was sure ahem DS working
hard to improve the competitiveness of
the radeon gpus that being the case we
won't banging on about this one too much
it's my opinion the current Radeon
architecture in this case the graphics
core next or GC and 5th generation
architecture needs to be better
optimized right now in order to deliver
equivalent performance at the high end
AMD's GPUs are over 50% larger when
compared to in videos pascal
architecture i arrive to that figure
when comparing vega 64 to the gtx 1080
for example this not only makes AMD's
vega GPUs much more costly to produce
but they also require much more power to
operate it seems that AMD's allocated a
huge amount of resources an effort to
try and fix their scheduling issues
issues that see so many of the cores on
parts like Vega 64 underutilized or not
utilized at all during heavy gaming
workloads another issue that's led to
Vega is underwhelming gaming experience
and this is probably the main issue is
the fact that AMD produce one mammoth
GPU to do it all whereas the competition
has two separate product lines one focus
solely on gaming with a more expensive
professional line designed for compute
work they probably need to work towards
a design that can be easily implemented
to suit either market I much like what
they've done with Xen with the rise and
an epic CPUs for example we were hoping
that na'vi would be the first step
towards that but it's sounding like and
we might have to wait another generation
yet at the end of the day as consumers
we just want to have more than one
option and while picking between say the
Radeon rx 580 and geforce gtx 1060 can
be a challenge as we saw in a recent
comparison it's less of a challenge at
the high end and anyone's spending i
know 500 dollars or more at a graphics
card i should probably go with the green
team
now this one isn't something that's
going to go away anytime soon despite
the fact that we would all very much
like it to a rather than refresh RIBA
Randall rehash whatever you want to call
it just don't do that do nothing wait to
actually have something new of course
it's not just AMD that's guilty of doing
this in video loves to rebrand or
whatever you want to call it products as
well that has to be said recently AMD
has been the biggest offender Nvidia did
release the GeForce 10 series in mid
2016 and then a few months later we got
the underwhelming Radeon RX 400 series
the flagship part was the rx 480 and it
did struggle to compete with the gtx
1060 at the time anyway just eight
months later an effort to spice up the
Radeon series and make them seem new and
exciting again AMD rebranded the rx
400-series as the RX 500 series I only
truly new bit of silicon we got was that
pathetic little rx 550 while the rx 560
was fully unlocked with 1024 cause
though aimed he did manage to that
one up creating the 14 CU and 16 CMS
anyway the refresh was designed to set
the stage for the Vegas series which
arrived four months later
so while Vega 56 and 64 were new paths
the RX 5 a TRX 570 well those were just
blatant rebadge --is the RX 560 was a
refresh that kind of went wrong in the
end and the rx 550 was the only truly
new GPU below the Vega models to my
opinion that ideally AMD should have
just added the Vega 56 and 64 GPUs
alongside the RX 400-series and that
would have been a lot less confusing and
led to far fewer and disappointing
reviews of rebranded products as I said
Nvidia is every bit as guilty when it
comes to rebranding or refreshing GPUs
so it's a practice that we would like to
see both companies just completely
forget about
okay so let's talk a little bit about
freesync before wrapping all of this up
in general freesync
is a great initiative and it brings
adaptive syncs support to a wide range
of monitors at an affordable price point
it's certainly nice to see free sync
monitors available at much lower prices
than equivalent g-sync monitors but
there are a few issues with the free
sync monitor ecosystem and it would be
nice to see AMD tidy it up for starters
free sync badges are a bit of a mess you
can find really good free SiC monitors
on the market and you can find really
bad free SiC monitors having the free
sync badge says nothing about the
quality of the display just that it
supports the VESA adaptive sync standard
crucially it doesn't tell you how well a
monitor supports adaptive sync there are
many free sync certified monitors with a
very small refresh rate window so small
they don't actually enhance the gaming
experience at all while technically
these sorts of monitors are free sync
compliant they may as well not have free
sync at all what we think AMD really
needs is something like a free sync gold
badge maybe or something along those
lines anyway that lets gamers
distinguish between basic free sync
implementations and free SiC monitors
with good quality panels and low
framerate compensation that delivers a
good gaming experience
AMD did try this with free sync too but
that's more designed for top-end
HDR displays a free sync gold badge
would be perfect for regular displays
that deliver great experiences from
basic to a DP 144 Hertz models right up
to top-end ultra Wired's one of the good
things about Nvidia g-sync validation is
that insures you get a good gaming
monitor when you see the g-sync badge if
I only been something similar it would
not only strengthen the free sync
ecosystem but it would make it easier to
pick out a good gaming monitor
so there's about half a dozen things we
as consumers feel AMD needs to address
admittedly many of these things aim
there's no doubt already working on but
things like the meaningless TDP rating
probably won't get addressed
unfortunately anyway I hope you enjoyed
this video and if you did hang tight
because next week we will tackle what
NVIDIA needs to fix and that could be a
much longer list so let us know in the
comment section down below if there's
anything you think we missed for this
video and if you have any suggestions
for the upcoming in video version as
always thank you for watching I'm your
host Steve and I will see you again next
