rockets war ah simple in a day and age
with motor mechanical gaming keyboards
just aren't it could be a real breath of
fresh air but like everything this will
really come down to personal preference
from the outset I can say like some
things about the simple design of this
keyboard for sure
however there's other things that
absolutely rule it out it's my daily
driver let's take a tour around the
keyboard first the first thing you have
to notice is how absolutely no space is
wasted here on the swara the only way it
could have been smaller would be to
either cut off the 10 key numpad or
squish the keys into an uncomfortable
level maintaining the full standard
layout roughly of squeeze in all of your
standing keys and then some taking the
swara from mechanical keyboard to
mechanical gaming keyboard
classification in my eyes are the
inclusions of the dedicated game mode
button and the macro controls built in
as a secondary function on the insert
home and del page up and page down Keys
another awesome inclusion is the
dedicated volume control keys also found
at the top right at the keyboard these
simple and extremely useful additions
what escalate this keyboard from minimal
to simple in my eyes and I believe it's
a really good compromise the keyboard is
also fully backlit another telltale sign
of a gaming keyboard this also saved
rocker from adding any dedicated LED
indicators for capslock and his friends
which are instead indicated on the keys
themselves the face up body of the
keyboard is made from a durable and
quite smudge resistant aluminium not
that much of it faces up you can only
really see the section with the rocket
logo above the arrow keys during use but
it looks good and also gives a nice
slightly reflective glow from the above
switch blue LEDs behind the key caps the
sides of the body are a glossy smudge
attracting surface however it's black
around and it's a small unnoticeable
section really at the back of the
keyboard you'll find the swirl logo as
long as a tagline reading frameless
mechanical gaming keyboard the underside
is simple featuring two flip-down legs
with rubberized feet and four rubber
pads at the front to keep the keyboard
in place the design is capped off with a
nice braided cable and that's about all
there is to say about it
this Rocket keyboard employers not
Cheria Max or Kyle switches but instead
TTC Braun mechanical switches which I
haven't encountered before I know the
TTC red switches were featured on the
budget
my keyboard and from all reports they're
very similar to the Cherry MX Reds these
TTC brown switches seem to follow suit
the very similar and feel and sound to
the Cherry MX browns if anything they
feel slightly lighter and make a
high-pitched sound the switches are
rated for 50 million strokes but as
they're relatively new on the market
it's tough to say how they'll stand up
but based on their feel and appearance
I wouldn't expect them to roll over and
die anytime soon but again that's an
educated guess at this point I don't
think rocket would include a switch
there wasn't the barre leash for liable
for actual typing this keyboard feels
great and this is how it sounds
I personally much prefer to have a wrist
rest so that was negative for me but the
keys layout and backlighting all made
for a great user experience the
dedicated game mode key is handy and can
be quickly toggled on and off without
looking even and the function key and
MIDI controls are great I myself
wouldn't choose to do extensive typing
on this keyboard because I find having a
wrist rest much more ergonomic however
for those that don't need one this
keyboard is entirely suitable rocket's
wom software controls the swara though
thankfully it's not required for almost
all of its functions before installing
it I was able to toggle between nine
different backlight brightness levels
plus off and a breathing effect after
installing and updating the swarm
software I was then able to tinker with
the character repeat rate adjust key
assignment and strangely switch on sound
feedback that makes us sound from your
speakers every time you make a keystroke
there's four sounds to choose from
including a click a typewriter sound a
beam sound and sci-fi sounds they're all
bad and anyone that uses it is another
but this inclusion obviously doesn't
take away from the keyboard it's more
like a funny prank you can pull over all
the swore is good at what it's meant to
be it's a simple mature to the point
product that gives users a full layout
without taking up any extra room on the
desk I think it hit a good sweet spot
between minimalism and features
including handy things like dedicated
volume control and the game mode key the
function key also opens up a few more
Handy controls and this is something we
see on almost all keyboards these days
I was a little surprised I had to
install multiple updates to the swamp
software in order to eventually interact
with the keyboard through it however
overall I'd say the software is pretty
unnecessary anyway you only opened it up
to use it if you want to change key
assignment or messed around with one of
the strangest features I've seen
included in the keyboard accompanying
software the sound feedback feature
which was surely just included as a
laughs in a simply designed mechanical
keyboard like this pricing is going to
be a huge factor the suarez shown you at
this stage is not listed on you egg or
Amazon yet however I did find it
available for pre-order EB Games in
Australia for a hundred and sixty
dollars this is a little pricey in my
eyes but all mechanical keyboards in
Australia are really I believe this
warrior is due to hit us retailers this
month and it should be available for a
hundred US dollars which is a little
more than I'd like to pay for this
feature set however for those that are
trying to find the small desk footprint
and simplicity then it will be well
worth it
comparing this to say the gigabyte for
scale III for example if I got to choose
I would choose this war for sure
it's only an extra twenty US dollars in
Australia though the fourth kd3 can be
had for ninety five bucks
quite a bit cheaper than the swara let's
hope the pricing comes down a little
down under it should be be games aren't
known for being super price competitive
