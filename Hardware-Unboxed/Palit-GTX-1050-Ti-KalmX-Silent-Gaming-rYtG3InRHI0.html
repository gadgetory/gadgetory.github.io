and if you're looking to make your PC as
quite as possible or maybe even silent
then one component you're really going
to need to focus your attention on is
the graphics card
well that is assuming you're a gamer of
course for the most part even extreme
graphics cards like the Auris GTX
Extreme Edition that I looked at
recently run very quiet certainly no
louder than the rest of the fans a
typical gaming system not only that but
once you have your speaker's cranked up
or your headset on you aren't exactly
going to notice the gentle hum of a
high-end gaming PC however there are
situations where some gamers find even
the smallest amount of fan noise and
nuisance I know I personally like to
have my gaming PC in the living room
generating as little noise as possible
keeping a modern Intel Core i5 processor
for example cool while also making very
little noise is pretty easily done there
are countless passive sea vehicles to
choose from
like this thermal right marchó heatsink
I have here but what about the graphics
card
well there are passive heat sinks you
can buy install on your graphics card as
well such as Arctic's excel or OS 3 a
universal passive cool that works with a
large number of AMD Nvidia graphics
cards however there are some downsides
this approach which you won't face when
passively cooling your cpu for starters
compatibility can be an issue the
accelerator 3 which I used in my example
is not guaranteed to work with AMD
Nvidia graphics cards that don't follow
the reference PCB design so any
deviation from this design could render
the cooler incompatible other drawbacks
include the fact that you must install
it yourself and therefore risk damaging
the graphics card and will also likely
void your warranty in the process then
there is the issue of the price at $40
u.s. is cooler while impressive isn't
exactly cost-effective especially if you
want to pair it with mid-range to
entry-level graphics cards this is where
palettes gtx 1050 TI Carmex steps in the
first and currently only passively
cooled gtx 1050 - I grabbed his card on
the market power launch there Carmex
line with the GTX 750 and 750 Ti
offering silent passively cool graphics
cards based on entry-level GPUs the 750
Ti was certainly capable enough though
it was released back in early 2014 but
today it's not really cutting it so
palette has upgraded and they are
replacing the 60 watt GPU is a much more
capable 75 watt TDP
model in the gtx 750ti now with 20% more
criticals that are also more refined and
almost 30% more bandwidth so the 1052 i
offers a serious performance boost the
big question of course is how does this
thing run without an active fan does
this nice big passive heatsink allow the
gtx 1050 Ti to run it reasonable
temperatures and of course if those
turbo frequencies without throttling
well as you might have expected that's
what we're here to find out in this
review and we will get to the results
shortly but before we do let's just take
a bit more of an in-depth look at this
graphics card
unsurprisingly pallette has opted for
these stock end video clock speeds for
the GPU and gddr5 memory
this means a base clock of 1290
megahertz with a boost clock of at least
1392 megahertz and I'll be very
interested to see just how high the GPU
boost 3.0 pushes things with this
graphics card the memory is clocked at
17 hundred and 50 megahertz for a
throughput of seven gigabits per second
now the graphics card itself measures
182 millimeters long and 142 millimeters
tall but it will also take up two slots
thanks to a 37 millimeter stick heatsink
the PCB meanwhile measures just 145
millimeters long and 112 millimeters
tall all up the car weighs 470 grams
which is surprisingly light given the
size of the passively cooled heatsink in
comparison gigabytes own gtx 1050 TIG
one gaming model is longer at 220
millimetres and quite a bit heavier at
612 grams also unlike the g1 gaming
model this pallet card doesn't require
an external 6 pin PCI power connector
and that's a very good thing in my
opinion the heatsink features a copper
base which comes in direct contact with
a pair of nickel-plated 6 millimeter
heat pipes which extend out and back
into the upper section of the
nickel-plated aluminium fin ra where
they evenly disperse heat from the base
part of the underside of the heatsink
has been flattened out and covered in
blue thermal pads which remove heat from
the cards vrm speaking of the vrm this
pallet card only features a basic 2+1
design which isn't particularly
impressive but then it is only designed
to operate at the default envía
specification and overclocking certainly
isn't a priority here as you might have
expected this graphics card does not
feature a backplate and the passive
cooler or the passive heatsink doesn't
wrap around onto the backside of the
graphics card
like we have sort of seen in the past
this old gigabyte model although the
cooler doesn't wrap around on to the
backside you can see that the thins
there do protrude onto the back side of
the card and this a soos silencer model
features most of the heatsink on the top
side so consider capture airflow from
around the CPU section but yeah
interesting design around at the i/o end
we find a basic configuration offering a
HDMI 2.0 output DisplayPort and DVI
output all three can be used
simultaneously for triple monitor
workstations ok so enough going over the
car max time to do some real testing out
of the box the pallet Carmex is just a
single frame slower than the gigabyte g1
gaming model and playing battlefield 1
my custom overclock which did push the
boost clock up to eighteen hundred and
ninety eight megahertz only increase the
average frame rate by six percent which
is disappointing given we saw a 13
percent jump in operating frequency the
titanfall 2 results are much the same
the stock Carmex card was slightly sold
and the gigabyte g1 gaming and with the
maximum overclock applied it was only
slightly faster last time I tested with
Call of Duty infinite warfare and here
the Carmack's was good for 47 FPS at
1080p overclocking orders an extra 3 FPS
for another 6 percent performance boost
under load palettes gtx 1050 - icomics
allowed for an entire system consumption
figure of 118 watts that's the exact
same figure reported using the msi gtx
1050 ti4 g OC card and it's - what's
less than the g1 gaming model now for
testing temperatures I decided to stick
the Carmex in my core i3 test rig rather
than extremely well ventilated core i7
test machine our core i3 system is built
inside the fractal design
defined on OS and here the graphics card
is pinned hard up against the PSU so
airflow is very minimal
even so after an hour-long stress test
playing rise of the Tomb Raider the GPU
temperature only maxed out at 75 degrees
I was quite impressed with that
temperature given the test system used
and of course this is a passively cooled
graphics card that's that I should note
that was quite cool on the day I tested
and I had no trouble keeping an ambient
room temperature of 21 degrees in the
office for comparison I took the GTX
1050 to icomics
out of a none OS and installed it into
the core i7 tester II which uses the
corsair crystal series 570 x RGB case
here at maxed out at 72 degrees again
after an hour of gameplay out of the box
the card did hold an operating frequency
of just 1683 megahertz and when
overclocked it reached 75 degrees at
1898 megahertz though as we saw
previously this only boosted performance
by around 6% well there you have it
pallets passively cooled geforce gtx
1050 to a graphics card works and it
works rather well for those willing to
build a super quiet home theater PC
capable of 1080p gaming then this
Carmack's graphics card will fit the
bill nicely
the only thing yet to be revealed is the
price though I'm not expecting it to
come in as a premium palette is
generally very competitive on pricing so
I wouldn't be surprised if this passive
version doesn't cost much more than a
base model card of course when it comes
to cost versus performance the GTX 1050
toy isn't that impressive to begin with
and many will just opt for an RX 470
instead however you cannot buy a
passively cooled rx 470 and I don't
expect that to change as it is a 120
watt 2 DP GPU this then does make the
palet gtx 1050 TI comics a very unique
and as I said previously a must-have
item for those lone to build a very
quiet PC let me know what you guys think
about this graphics card in the comments
below and if you enjoyed the review
maybe consider giving it a like anyway
I'm your host Steve see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
