let me get this off my chest I was wrong
well sort of I did grossly underestimate
how powerful these nuturing GPUs would
be and while I'm the first to admit that
I didn't stress the time that I was only
guessing while making a number of
assumptions and you know what they say
about those but I was pretty confident
my claims I think I was allowing the
high prices which really annoyed me at
the time the one-month pre-order period
and all the faffing about ever retracing
all that stuff to sort of cloud my
judgment a bit and I did jump the gun on
a few things having said that in my
defense you know defend myself ever so
slightly but I admit I was very much
wrong on the performance claims but I
did have your best interests at heart
the theme in that video was don't
pre-order play it safe make an informed
purchase after all these aren't exactly
cheap graphics cards and I wasn't
exactly wrong for questioning how much
value they would ultimately offer but as
I said the performance claims were a bit
off
I was actually miles off on my RT X 2080
claim which is quite interesting and
possibly more interesting as the fact
that I wasn't that far off on my RT X xx
atti
performance claim so that's probably
going to disappoint a few of you anyway
enough about that for now let's get to
the results because I know you've had
enough speculation or leaks slides from
Nvidia and even official information
regarding specifications and pricing so
rather than go over any of that I'm just
gonna get straight to the benchmarks
starting with a few quick words on the
test system as usual I'm using our
Corsair GPU test system built inside the
crystal series 570 X with a core i7 8700
K clocked at five years for 32 gigabytes
of vengence ddr4 3400 memory for the AMD
GPUs I've used the Radeon a journal in
addition 18.9 point one driver and for
Nvidia the GeForce 399 24 driver while
the new GeForce RCX 20 series GPUs will
be using driver version for 11.50 one in
total we have a dozen games to go over
along with a few other
tests then tomorrow we will unleash a
mega 35 game benchmark okay let's get to
the results starting with the
battlefield one 1440p results we see at
the r-tx 28 he is able to deliver gtx
280 i like performance initially I was
worried the 2080 would be slower than
the TT I placing it somewhere between
the 1080 and 1080 Ti thankfully though
it is better than that and we see it
delivering 27% more performance on the
GTX 1080 when comparing the average
frame rate and 23 percent more for the
frame time result the 2080 Ti is an
absolute beast here beating both the
2080 and 1080 TI by over a 25 percent
margin pretty incredible stuff but let's
move on before K to see what happens
there here the GTX 20/80 like the 1080 I
was able to provide player performance
rendering 24% more frames on average
when compared to AMD's Radeon Vegas 64
liquid but it was the 20 80 TI that
again blew us away with an incredible
100 FPS on average at 4k and battlefield
1 using the ultra quality settings in
fact the frame time performance of the
20 80 TI was higher than that of the
1080 TI's average frame rate so that's
pretty incredible
moving on to Far Cry 5 and again we sent
the our checks 28 he is able to mirror
the GTX 292 eyes performance with 112
FPS on average making it 27 percent
faster than the GTX 1080
as for the 2080 ti that pushed the
average frame rate out to 132 FPS but we
are clearly running into a system
bottleneck here as the frame time
performance is similar to that of the
1080 TI
who would have thought that 1440p using
ultra quality settings that are 5
gigahertz all caught 8700 k overclock
would be holding things up moving to 4k
relieves the system bottleneck and now
the 2080 TR is 28% faster than Italian T
on average and 25% faster for the frame
time result the 2080 is also 30% faster
than the GTX
1080 so another impressive result there
that said while the 2080 does average 61
fps you will notice dips slightly below
that of course it is still very playable
but it's not as silky smooth disease
experience seeing when you're using mid
20 80 TI that is truly breathtaking next
that we have ARMA 3 a title that's
always heavily require
here we set 1440p that we're certainly
not GPU about it's quite clear that
there's some other kind of system
bottleneck or possibly even a limitation
of the game itself so we'll have to move
to 4k to see what the new r-tx GPUs can
offer right so at 4k we only see a
slight drop in performance for the 2080
ti when compared to the 1440p numbers
just seen this means it's now 30 percent
faster than 2080 and 1080 TI meanwhile
the 28 is 35 percent faster than GT X
1080 and that is a pretty serious margin
right there moving along we have some
Grand Theft Auto 5 results and again I
know this is a seriously old title but
it's still very popular and you guys
seem to absolutely lose your mind if I
don't include it so in an effort to keep
the peace here are the results also
please note the game has been maxed out
including all the advanced graphical
settings
despite that though we are seeing a
pretty heavy system bottleneck at 1440p
so the results here are somewhat useless
though they do inform us that if you are
a massive gta5 fan and you only play at
1440p then the r-tx series won't really
provide a noticeable performance boost
once again it is the 4k resolution that
helps separate the RT axis from the GT
axes here the 20 ATT I was 37 percent
faster than the 1080 - oh and that's a
seriously nice game we also said that
2080 roughly match the 1000 you see I
place it well ahead of the vanilla 1080
so an amazing result here hitman is yet
another title that sees us somewhat CPU
limited at 1440p I see the 20 ATT I was
just 8% faster than the 1080 - OH
so let's move to 4k to see if the more
extreme resolution helps shift the focus
towards the GPU once again it is the 4k
resolution that helps separate the RT
axis from the GT axis here the 2080 CI
was 24% fast and the TI and decent
performance jump but not really enough
to justify the price increase meanwhile
the 2080 roughly matched the 1080i
making a 30% faster than the standard
1080 which is actually quite an
impressive result for the first time
ever no man's sky has found its way into
our benchmarks quite a few viewers
request that we test with the title
since it has been updated apparently now
it is actually pretty good performance
with the new r-tx graphics
isn't bad either the 2080 was a smidgen
faster than the 1080i and this meant it
was a whopping 49 percent faster than
the 1080 then at the very top of our
graph we of course have the new art CX
2080 TI which offered a 25 percent
performance bump over the standard 2080
increasing the resolution to 4k helped
the 2080 TX then its lead ever so
slightly over the 2080
now it's 27% faster meanwhile the 2080
beat the 1080 by a slightly less
impressive 14% margin the results seen
when testing with project cars - aren't
as impressive as we're expecting and
here we don't appear to be running into
any kind of system bottleneck the 2080
TI was just 18 percent faster than the
1080i and the 2080 just 21 percent
faster than the 1080 apologies for all
1080 and 20 ATS in this video but
there's really no way of getting around
it
anyway hopping up to the 4k resolution
did nothing to help out the 20 atti here
it was less than 20 percent faster than
the 1080 TI while the 20 80 was now just
19% faster than the 1080 this could
merely be a driver issue or it could be
that cheering is unable to leverage the
integer course in this title next up we
have Rainbow six siege and this titles
always leverage the Radeon GPUs very
well
here we see vega 56 matching the gtx
1080 and beating the 1070 TI something
it doesn't often do shirring does seem
to correct this and here we are seeing
some pretty stellar gains over Pascal
given at 1440p here the 2080 TI was
almost 40% faster than the 1080 TI while
the 2080 is 51% faster than the 1080
those are some serious gains and we see
them continue at 4k as the 2080 TI is
now 51% fast and the 1080i and the 2080
52 % faster than the 1080 again and
those are some seriously impressive
gains right there I was shocked to see
145 FPS on average at 4k from the 2080
ti that is just mind-bending performance
another you title that we're
benchmarking for the first time is
shadow of the Tomb Raider and what an
incredibly amazing looking game this one
is you'll certainly want to dial up the
eye candy and with the new r-tx graphics
cards that's not really a problem here
we see if the 2080 again matched
1080 at 1440p while the 28 ETA was 24
percent faster hitting 107 FPS even at
4k the performance provided by the 2080
Ti is pretty unbelievable 59 FPS on
average with a 1% lower result of 50 fps
in a game that looks at this good that's
an incredible result and if you drop the
preset just one level to higher the
average frame rate jumps up to 80 FPS
with a 1% low result of over 60 FPS so
again really impressive performance at
the 4k resolution the 2080 also does
quite well though like the 1080i you
will at times notice the slight dip in
frame rates but I am of course being
quite picky and after all these
certainly hard cheap graphics cards
strange Brigade is a recently released
title that we've already benchmarked
quite extensively on the channel here we
see at the RT X 2080 matches the 1080 Ti
at 1440p and this made 36 percent faster
than the GTX 1080 as impressive as 125
FPS on average is the 20 ATT I
absolutely blew that away with 163 fps
making it 28% faster than the 1080 TI
that margin is slightly reduced at 4k
down at 27% but that still makes the
2080 TI by far the fastest GPU in this
test pushing 94 FPS on average the 2080
also managed 69 FPS on average with a 1%
lower result 59 fps so it also allowed
for a nice smooth gaming experience at
4k the second last game we're gonna look
at is vermintide 2 and here the 2082 I
rendered 133 FPS on average 1440p making
it 25% fast in the 1080i and 2080
meanwhile the 2080 was almost 40 percent
faster than the 1080 so a pretty big
step forward there vermintide 2 looks
quite exceptional at 4k and playing on
an RT X 20 atti with over 60 FPS at all
times was a bit special it's an
expensive experience but ahem does it
look good it's only 24% faster than the
GTX 1080i but it makes a massive
difference to gameplay the 20/80 was
also just 17 percent faster than
eternity but again that made a huge
difference to how well the game played
finally last game they were going to
check out in this review is Wolfenstein
- the new Colossus and
wow just wow nvidia has focused on
improving their async compute
performance and the results here just
speak for themselves okay so the 2080 Ti
is averaging 273 fps 1440p using the
maximum in-game quality settings you'd
be forgiven for thinking that
Wolfenstein 2 must look like fortnight
this made the 2080 ti 41 percent faster
than the 1080i while the 2080 was 49%
faster than the 1080
however those margins are further
extended at 4k here the 2080 Ti is seen
to be 55% fast in the TTI that said the
2080 maintains a similar lead over the
1080 as they were less CPU limited at
the lower 1440p resolution but seriously
can I just say wow one more time Pahadi
Hal 170 FPS on average at 4k I mean the
1080 T I was already blistering fast
this tile but a hundred and seventy FPS
with a 1% low of 152 FPS holy moly
that's fast of course you can make the
2080 TI a little bit faster by
overclocking it though as was the case
with Pascal they are pretty well tapped
out it was possible to increase the GDD
r6 memory frequency by 650 megahertz and
the core by 190 megahertz this resulted
in an average operating frequency of
1940 megahertz for the cause when gaming
the vanilla 2080 accepted the same 650
megahertz for the memory but 120
megahertz for the cores as the cores are
clocked a little higher by default this
resulted in an average core clock
frequency of twenty one hundred and
fifty megahertz when gaming ultimately
what all this means is you're able to
squeeze about 9% more frames out of the
28 E and 5% more out of the 28 e TI when
testing with shadow of the Tomb Raider
not mind-blowing but it is extra
performance for free the 20 ATT I again
saw a 5% boost from the overclock at
this time when testing with strange
Brigade
meanwhile the 2080 saw a similar 7%
boost to performance again not amazing
but it's better than a sharp stick in
the eye
moving on here is an overview of the
2080 TI and 2080 founders and graphics
cards both stock and over
as you can see the operating
temperatures only increased by five
degrees when overclocked and we saw a 6
or 12 percent increase in fan speed I
should note that the operating volumes
for the founders edition models were
very low the cards are basically silent
when installed in the system even at
2200 rpm the dual fans can barely be
heard so quality wise the fe cards are
good but we still don't recommend you
buy them given that they cost more than
the AIB models and cards from MSI or
soos gigabyte and so on are likely to be
as good if not better
the average operating frequency of the
28 ET art was increased by 11% and the
2080 by 12% but of course we've already
looked at the resulting performance the
GDD are 6 memory also ran at 7600 50
megahertz once overclocked for a
throughput of fifteen point three
gigabits per second oh and I almost
forgot
power consumption we should probably
touch on that the r-tx 2080 Ti is a bit
of a power peak pushing total system
consumption up towards 500 watts which
is Vega 60 for liquid territory of
course in terms of efficiency it is
world's better and I think we can accept
this kind of power consumption given the
resulting performance after all total
system consumption was only up 15
percent from the 1080 Ti then we see
that the r-tx
2080 system configuration consumed 20%
less power and compared to the GTX 1080
TI which is a reasonable improvement
given it delivers comparable performance
okay so we've now looked at performance
than a dozen games and if you think the
choice of titles seem to be odd a bit
random please know that it's neither of
those things and in tomorrow's video
it'll be a lot clearer as to why I chose
the titles that I did for this video
I'll certainly briefly touch on
overclocking I really didn't go into any
depth there at all just showed a few
performance numbers and the frequencies
that I got to which I'm pretty sure are
the maximum frequencies that my cards
could do without on you're really
serious modifications but anyway Tim
will be following up on the channel the
next few days with some more in-depth
overclocking content overclocking guides
perhaps all that sort of stuff but
anyway for now we need to finish this
review so let's take a closer look at
the performance breakdown we did often
find that the 2080 ti was CPU bound at
1440p so unsurprisingly here it is
just 23% faster the 1080i on average
that said we do see examples of it
providing games in excess of 30 percent
with Rainbow six siege and Wolfenstein
being the standouts here we see the same
batch of test run at 4k extends the lead
out to 31% so on average the 20 ATT is
31 percent faster than the 1080 TI
according to our results the most
notable change here is Grand Theft Auto
5 previously the 20 ATT I was just 1%
faster as the system was heavily
limiting performance but now for Kade is
able to provide 37% more performance
again Wolfenstein 2 is the standout
result for the 2080 ti but it also does
well in Rainbow six siege and no man's
sky comparing the 2080 TI and 2088 1440p
provides similar results to what was
seen when comparing the 2080 TI and
1080i here the 2080 ti beats the
standard version by a 21% margin on
average the margin is extended to 30% at
4k and again this is because the 2080 ti
isn't limited by other components in the
system the 20 80 TI packs 48 % more
criticals in the 20 80 so a 30%
performance uplift on average is what
you'd probably expect to see now looking
at the RT x 2080 we see that when
compared to the 1080i it was just 1
percent faster on average at 1440p it's
only notable wins came in Rainbow six
siege and Wolfenstein 2 while it was
slower by a 5 percent margin or more in
hitman and project cars - the merger
remains much the same at 4k and so do
the performance trends
so overall the 2080 is offering 1080i
light performance when compared to the
GTX 1080 the new 2080 was 29% faster on
average at 1440p which isn't bad and
slightly better than 23% gain the 2080
ti provided over the 1080 TI then
finally at 4k the 2080 offered 34% more
performance which is certainly a very
respectable gain but then I suppose it
really comes down to how they stack up
in terms of cost per frame so let's look
at that now okay so we're going to
actually make a few cost per frame
comparisons based on the 4k results just
seen first let's look strictly at AIB
MSRP s that is the suggested retail
price for videos board putts like MSI
gigabyte and a soos for example added to
the model names on the graphs axis are
the MSRP s so why
thousand dollars us for the r-tx 20 atti
for example this means the twenty atti
comes at a cost of 10 dollars and
seventy five cents per frame based on
the performance just seen that figure
alone means nothing but when compared to
the ten atti it means you're paying a
nine percent premium for the new
flagship GPU so although the MSRP has
increased by 43 percent given the
additional performance you're only
paying nine percent more but of course
that's not really how we should look at
this given that Pascal is now a two-year
old architecture but I will discuss that
more later
the r-tx twenty eighty comes in at a
cost of nine dollars and fifty eight
cents per frame and that makes it just
four percent more costly than the GTX
ten eighty and three percent cheaper
than the GTX two no UTI so that actually
seems pretty good and by all accounts it
is I mean it's not exactly great
progress as you're effectively paying
gtx 980ti money for gtx 980ti
performance and well we've had that for
like a year and a half now and it's
worth noting that the situation gets
much worse if we price in the founders
edition models the 2080 fe costs as much
as an AI be twenty atti per frame and
then the $1,200 u.s. twenty atti comes
in at a staggering twelve dollars and
ninety cents per frame thirty-one
percent more than the ten atti
but yet again it gets even worse than
that because you're forced to pay the FE
premium on all geforce twenty series
cards so that being the case let's take
a look at the current market prices this
is what you can currently expect to pay
for an RT x 2080 and 20 atti and it's
pretty berdal the twenty eighty comes in
at a cost of $11.50 per frame making it
worse value than Vegas 64 and 20% more
costly than a gtx 980ti again for the
same performance the 2080 TI is
basically a break-even scenario it's
about 30% faster than the gtx 1080i and
it costs about 35 percent more per frame
of course you will want to be able to
use all that extra performance as it
costs almost 80% more up front
it's meant to be something else that I'm
supposed to cover in this review what am
I forgetting it's meant to be some other
big advantage of buying these new NVIDIA
GeForce r-tx graphics cards
Oh silly meets in the name isn't it
Freight racing VRTX 20 atti packs 10
Giga Ray's per second of racing
performance and right now you can
utilize a total of zero Giga Ray's per
second considering how much noise and
video has made about this technology and
we spent the vast majority of the
GeForce 20 Series announcement talking
about nothing else it's pretty shocking
that every gamer who ordered one after
seeing that amazing Star Wars demo that
was basically running on a supercomputer
mind you can't actually use the
technology in any of their favorite
games in fact right now we're waiting on
a Windows 10 update which is scheduled
for release next month before it's even
possible to use the technology at all
but of course we also need games and
frankly the list of games advertised to
include rate racing at this point is
pretty underwhelming currently the list
includes less than a dozen games and
they make up maybe a quarter of the
hotly anticipated titles that will be
released over the next year also I'm
going to risk making an assumption again
and that assumption is that most gamers
aren't a fan of all games so chances are
there's only a couple of titles coming
out over the next twelve months or so
that support rate racing that you'll
actually want to play one of the best
looking games is shut off the Tomb
Raider which can't actually support rate
racing till next month at the earliest
at which point most of you who want to
play that game will have played that
game so going back and playing it again
just to check out rate racing makes it
more of a tech demo at that point so it
seems as we suspected Nvidia made a heap
of noise about road racing to justify
the crazy high prices of these new GPUs
it's unlikely that many of you will want
to or will be able to take advantage of
rate racing with the new GeForce 20
series GPUs of course at this point
that's just speculation on my behalf we
will just have to wait and see but
already the games list is a pretty
strong indicator that I'm probably not
wrong on this one
DLS s or deep learning super sampling is
another exciting new feature that we
just can't test out yet outside of a few
demos and while the list of supported
games is more extensive it is also
rather limited so again this is a
benefit wait in the C situation when it
comes to our reviews here at harbor
unboxed we really only like to make
recommendations based on the facts that
we have at hand which is why we were a
little hesitant to recommend horizon
initially as it wasn't really clear how
long it would be before those extra
cause would prove useful for gamers in
the case of these new GeForce RT X
graphics cards we could only base our
assessment on the games tested as well
as the current market prices and while
that being the case these new GeForce
graphics cards in my opinion are a bit
of a tough sell and frankly if I'd
preorder 90 X 2080 I'd be seriously
considering canceling that pre-order
right now it has to be said the RT X
2080 makes little sense at the $700 AIB
MSRP it's okay I guess
basically it's a few percentage points
better than the GTX tonight EW and what
all the gains are impressive and tile
such as Rainbow six siege and
Wolfenstein 2 for the most part the
gains are very small and we will better
illustrate this in tomorrow's 35 game
benchmark so as I said earlier after a
year and a half we're getting gtx 980ti
like performance for GTX today ETI money
but then that's not even true is it
we're getting gtx 980ti light
performance for a 20% price hike and
then the hope that rate racing won't be
a complete bust for this generation so
after a year and a half of gaming with
the gtx 1080i telling me rather
unimpressed but we do have the extremely
impressive
RTX 2080 TI the sock blower i lost so
many pairs of socks benchmarking this
thing in a few dozen games that I've had
to restock my drawer it is a mighty
impressive GPU in terms of performance
as we saw it was on average 31 percent
faster than the already fast GTX 1080i
so finally 4k higher quality gaming on a
single graphics card is now a reality
but it's a reality you'll probably need
a second job to enjoy at the $1000 a IB
MSRP
it's not too bad as crazy as that sounds
you're still paying a premium but it's
less than 10% over the 10 a UTI however
at the current market price it's a bad
joke 35 percent premium over the 1080 I
know thank you in video if you've got
money to burn then I guess the r-tx 20
atti can be justified because well
you're not really needing to justify
anything after all a 4k 144 hurts gammy
monitor starts at $2,000
so I guess dropping $1,200 on a graphics
card to make use of that weren't really
being an issue for the rest of us it's
just not worth touching AMD's Vegas 64
is horrible value and you'll be paying
even more per frame for an RT x 20 80
and 20 80 TI so that's probably all you
really need to know horrible pricing
aside that I am in awe of the
performance these new GPUs can achieve
particularly the RCX 2080 ti it's 4k
gaming performance really is
unbelievably awesome
even so despite being completely wowed
by the r-tx 2080 Ti and having admitted
that I was wrong with my destiny at the
start of this video as to how these
cards would perform I don't really
regret being cautious
I'd probably rather they didn't
speculate at all because that's
something we almost never do here at
harbor unboxed but if I had to which I
have so there's no going back on that
now I'm glad I was well under or not
yeah I'm glad I was under I was 10
percent under for the the RT X 20 80 TI
and I'm glad I wasn't 10 percent over
because that might have prompted some of
you guys to pre-order and now you can
make an informed buying decision that
being the case if you were going to pull
the trigger on let's say the arch X 2000
either of them really but this is the
one I'm probably most disappointing
because at least this one although the
pricings even worse it enables something
that no other product does so there's
some you can kind of justify the premium
I suppose but anyway let's not get into
that if you're going to preorder this
card or you're going to wait for the
reviews and buy it have the reviews
changed your mind in any way or you now
on your way to buy an hour RT x 2080 let
me know in the comment section down
because as always I am very keen to hear
your thoughts and with that I am going
to end this video because I am
absolutely naked I don't even know how
many days we spent on this content piece
or I spent on it Tim's about to get busy
because these cards are heading his way
but yeah it was a fun but grueling
couple of days of benchmarking and
putting this content together so I hope
you did enjoy it if you did feel free to
the like button for us we greatly
appreciate that subscribe for more
content because you are not going to
want to miss what we have coming on the
channel tomorrow because that's the main
reason why I haven't done much sleeping
and then after that you may have noticed
this little guy this little graphics
card yep it's a new MSI gaming trio or
what is it the the gaming extra I forgot
the X you've gotta get the X in there
but uh it's kind of a big graphics card
it's kind of a big RT X xx atti and it's
possibly one of the best - the best one
you can money can buy and certainly
certainly Dwarfs the foundation car I
thought this thing was heavy but no it's
not heavy not heavy at all it's quite
light in fact so yeah this will there'll
be a review on this on the channel
