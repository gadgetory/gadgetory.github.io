we're going to be diving a little deeper
into overclocking the new NVIDIA GeForce
RTX 2080 TI covering a whole range of
things from how to over hook these cards
to typical achievable clock speeds to
performance and power consumption if you
have overclocked to a GPU before a lot
of the things we go through in the guide
section of this video will be pretty
familiar to you there depending on what
GPU you last overclocked there might be
a few new things to note and of course
if you're more interested in things like
final overclocked performance and clock
speeds you can just skip over the
instructional section to start this
video I'll be going through our standard
methodology for overclocking Nvidia
graphics cards and specifically the r-tx
20 ATT I will also be showing you how
invidious new scanner API works and just
how good their one-click overclocking
can be comparing to a manual overclock
while also showing you how to do set
male overclock and of course the scanner
API is new for these cheering cards the
card we're using today is the founders
Edition r-tx 2080 TI which does come
factory overclocked in some sense
compared to base level board partner
models but that OC is you know it's
quite a smaller just 90 megahertz on the
core and nothing on the memory but the
card we're using doesn't really matter
the steps you see here will apply to all
our TX 20 ATT icons so the first thing
we'll be doing is going through
potentially the easiest method of
overclocking your our TX 2080 Ti and
that's using invidious new scanner API
one-click overclock II has been around
for a while now but this time Nvidia has
built a framework for doing it rather
than letting board partners create their
own algorithms and according to Nvidia
their framework is better tuned for
their GPUs more accurate and more
reliable than any previous one-click
methods to use in video scanner you'll
need to grab one of the very latest
versions of an overclocking utility the
- we tried were EVGA precision x1 and
MSI Afterburner both in their beta
versions and for the scanner
functionality we found afterburner to be
more reliable I had a few crash issues
with the early version of precision x1
which I assume will get fixed whereas
afterburner seemed to work every time
it's a business
Onias precision has a much nicer
interface than afterburner but we'll get
back to using precision a bit later in
the video
so after you've installed and opened
afterburner you'll see a bunch of dials
and sliders bit of a cloud interface but
that's fine what we're interested in is
the small bar graph icon to the left of
the core clock slider at this stage it's
not necessary to touch anything else in
the app simply click on the bar graph
icon then click OC scanner and then in
that window hit scan now you can sit
back and wait a while because the
one-click overclock process takes around
15 to 20 minutes what the scanner is
doing is basically running a bunch of
clock speed tests at a range of voltages
to find the exact voltage frequency
curve for your twenty atti Morel it has
its own test algorithm built in to
stress the GPU with the ability to
recover from any hangs or crashes if the
GPU is being pushed a bit too hard
it's basically simulating what we'd do
with the manual overclock but doing it
faster and potentially more accurately
don't worry if the application hands or
your screen goes black temporarily
during the process that's normal at the
end you'll be given an average overclock
but crucially you'll get a full
frequency curve which potentially is a
bit more efficient than a simple core
frequency offset and you can see at the
lower end of the voltage curve we're
getting slightly higher over clocks than
at the top on average we achieved plus
181 megahertz for our card but the
top-end our OC is just around plus 150
ma Hertz at this point would recommend
heading back into the afterburner main
application and cranking up the power
and temperature limits to the maximum
we've never been shmurda card even a
large generation Pascal card that didn't
like having these limits raised all the
way so with the 2080 ti it just makes
sense to crank it up
this will allow invidious GPU boost
algorithm to push as high as possible on
top of the frequency curve we've already
set potentially going beyond the old
limit one thing to note here is we have
just set the power and temperature limit
after running Nvidia scanner Nvidia says
the scanner only modifies the core clock
so if you change the power and
temperature limits beforehand the
scanner might find different and
potentially higher core clocks however
in our experience we actually achieved
lower clocks in the scanner setting the
power limit before hand so we recommend
cranking it up after the scanner is
complete the other obvious limitation is
the lack of memory clock gains invidious
can only handles the GPU core and
doesn't touch memory so if you after
that simple one-click overclock solution
you'll be missing out on any games you'd
get from tweaking memory core
overclocking is much more important for
getting performance gains but a booster
memory can help out in some situations
so we've got the scanner OC results now
in the bag
let's show you how to perform a manual
overclock and after that we'll compare
the manual overclock to the scan results
for this with witching to EVGA precision
x1 because it has a much nicer and more
intuitive interface for a manual
overclock we want to start from a decent
point so again we're going to crank the
power limit and temperature limits in
the maximum we're also going to scroll
the bottom section across to the temper
tuner and adjust the curve so we're
getting the maximum clock speed at all
possible temperatures for our reference
card this isn't a big deal as we're not
reaching up to those highest
temperatures but if you are running
above 84 degrees Celsius you'll want to
adjust this curve for maximum
performance from here it's all about
adjusting the two main sliders from
memory and core frequency the basic
steps are we want to increase each value
by a reasonable amount apply the
overclock then validate it in a program
like 3d mark to ensure we're not getting
crashes at those settings demand you
increase the values is up to you but
note that you're not going to damage
your car by choosing a value that's too
high instead you'll just crash your
system and have to reset it so that's no
big deal for the 28 ETI we started with
around a +1 50 megahertz offset on the
core and plus 500 on the memory those
are fairly conservative figures for the
card that worked in 3d mark so we pushed
the crop to plus 200 and memory up to
plus 650 if you want to play it a bit
more safe we'd recommend only changing
one of those values per test run but the
more you become familiar with the
process the more you can adjust at once
with plus 200 on the core our 20 atti
crashed in 3d mark so now it's a process
of finding the exact limit we step down
in 10 megahertz increments eventually
discovering there +180 was unstable but
plus 170 was perfectly fine from here we
can try to push up the memory even
further using a similar sort of process
and for our model we settled on plus 700
B that sweet spot so our final stable
overclock for this card was plus 170
mega Hertz on the core and
at 700 megahertz on the memory and
that's a fairly typical figure going on
what we've seen from others note that if
you have a non Fe on non-factory OSI
card the core offset you'll need will be
high as you're coming from a lower
starting point once you find what you
think our stable overclocked it's always
a good idea to validate them further in
a game running for several hours
something you're very GPU intensive
while 3dmax time spike gives a good
indication of whether a card will work
at a certain frequency sometimes it will
only crash under a longer test so it's
good to test both a quick note on
voltage Nvidia stirring cards are
voltage locked in other words Nvidia
does not expose proper voltage controls
to the user like you might get with
overclocking a CPU on a motherboard
instead we have a voltage slider but
it's not really an offset what it
theoretically does is raise the voltage
limit by a few steps but it's still
within what Nvidia deems safe and that
comes at the expense of lifespan Nvidia
claims you should get five years out of
stock voltage and just one year with the
voltage limit raised slightly so keep
that in mind in practice raising the
voltage slider did absolutely nothing
for overclock where +1 70 megahertz on
the core was stable under a zero voltage
figure plus 180 mega Hertz with a
maximum 100 voltage figure still wasn't
stable you might have a different
experience but it did absolutely nothing
for us so in a pure clock offset basis
the scanner OC coming in at around plus
150 megahertz the top voltage range is
lower than our plus 1 70 megahertz
manual overclock plus of course with
manual overclocking release the memory
frequency as well this indicates manual
overclocking is still the way to go and
you can see this is the case when
looking at our shadow of the Tomb Raider
results here the scanner provided a
seven percent performance improvement
over the FE clocks whereas our manual
overclock produced a 12 percent
improvement however the scanner does not
overclock the memory for those looking
for a quick overclock procedure one easy
trick might be to use a fairly
conservative memory overclock for
simplicity's sake something like plus
600 megahertz going with that changes
the results and makes the scanner +
memory overclock 11% faster than the FE
clocks but again the full manual
overclock provides a slightly better
result of further 1.5 percentage points
so we've now shown that our manual
overclock is very slightly superior to
the results with the OC scan announced
and a handful of games to see how the
overclock compares to both stock and
founders edition performance in shadow
of the Tomb Raider running at 4k with
the maximum quality settings and SMA T
2x we saw overclocking provides 16% more
performance than the standard clocks for
the 2080 ti and 12% more than the
founders edition clocks that's not a bad
result certainly worth doing but you're
not going to have your socks blown off
by the overclocking Headroom available
in this card at least especially
compared from the founders edition in
Assassin's Creed origins a 4k ultrahigh
preset the margins are a little narrower
11% performance increase over the
default clocks and 9% over the founders
edition in Far Cry 5 we're looking at
16% over the default and 12% over the
founders edition again same results as
shadow of the Tomb Raider in Middle
Earth shadow of war there was a 14%
improvement over default and 11% over
founders edition and finally in Batman
Arkham Knight 12% over default and 9%
over founders edition so from those five
games we achieved a performance
improvement of 14% on average compared
to the stock clocks and 10% compared to
the founders edition clocks we're pretty
much running into a power lumen here
looking at the design of the power
delivery system on the FE cards there
might be a bit more Headroom available
if Nvidia properly unlocked voltage
controls but this is around as good as
we're getting from what we can configure
at the moment of course we should note
that Nvidia
do appear to be bidding their twenty
atti GPUs graphics card shipped with
stock clocks use one SKU while those
with factory o'seas use a different
potentially bin SKU this means that
factory OC card should overclock a
better than their non OC alternatives so
while we are saying here that we
achieved a 14% performance improvement
compared to default clocks the reality
is some cards shipped at default Cox
won't OC as well in terms of
temperatures and fan speeds what Steve
found in his initial review of the 2080
TR is spot on in what I achieved on my
test bench core temperatures increased
from 76 degrees Celsius under load with
the founders edition clocks to 81
degrees when overclocked
that's a bit below the cards 1984
degrees temperature limit and well below
the increased 88 degrees limit so it's
pretty clear that that's not going to be
a limiting factor for performance fan
speeds as well 2060 rpm with the EFI
clocks 20
90 when overclocked using the default
auto fan speed so a slight increase
there but really no difference to the
sound profile the card is pretty quiet
while overclocked also of course both
the noise output and temperature will be
different with board partner morals and
if you're wondering about power
consumption well there wasn't a lot of
difference in load power draw between
the default and founders edition clocks
though that shouldn't be a huge surprise
considering the FE clocks are only about
three percent faster but when
overclocked power draw increases by
around fourteen percent on average
compared to the FE clocks so a 14
percent increase in consumption for 10
percent more performance that's a pretty
typical result if you're wondering about
the actual clock speeds I achieved I was
averaging around 1680 megahertz in
shadow of the tomb raider with the stock
clocks
17 70 megahertz with the FE clocks and
around nineteen eighty megahertz when
overclocked with a peak around 2100
megahertz
I also tried overclocking with the fan
set to 100 percent which dropped
temperatures by twenty degrees Celsius
but that only got around thirty to fifty
megahertz and more out of the card and
that was purely from GPU boost changing
the clock offset resulted in instability
running the fans at 100% resulted in
less than or one percent boost to
performance over our manual overclock
with the fans on auto and of course the
card is much louder at a hundred percent
so it's really not worth it at least
with our sample however those who
installed liquid cools on the card might
be able to eke out a bit of extra
performance but not all that much so
that just about wraps up this look into
twenty atti overclocking with the cards
we have on hand there is some extra
performance to squeeze out and it will
be interesting to see if anything more
can be gained from additional tweaks
particularly special mods to increase
voltage for regular users though around
a ten percent increase over EFI cards is
expected and of course we shown every
card results in our previous benchmark
video so if you're interested what extra
performance you'll be able to get with
overclocking simply apply sort of a ten
percent increase on average to those
game results may your overclocking is
still the go-to option though invidious
scanner API is quite handy for those
that don't want the pain of manual
tweaking if you're interested now on
