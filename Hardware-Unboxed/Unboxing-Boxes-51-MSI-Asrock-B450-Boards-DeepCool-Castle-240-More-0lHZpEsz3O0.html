it is time for another episode of
unboxing boxes so on the menu today I
think we have some motherboards that
we've been waiting quite some time for
we'll start with this box up here
because I'm certain this has what we're
after because it says be 450 tomahawk
spoiler alert
so we'll get into that quickly and
they've made this one quite difficult to
get into okay now that we've removed a
lot unnecessary strapping time to see
what is inside yeah I think I've got
this around the right way here we go
can you believe it they are finally here
after what's been an unusually long wait
it has to be said since the second
generalize and processors came they
launched with the X 470 chipsets and
everyone was left wondering where the b4
50s were and then finally we did see
them at Computex and now it's like I
don't know two months since Computex and
I finally have one in hand and you
should be able to buy one I think it's
in about a week or two anyway you've
probably come here to see what it looks
like we'll get that information out of
the way because that's probably still
under NDA bit of benchmark numbers and
whatnot from msi part from the
motherboard and you get a pair of SATA
cables some cool msi stickers CD thing
manual and an i/o shield so pretty basic
stuff as you'd expect with a budget
focused board
so the be 450 tomahawk looks to be quite
an impressive budget sort of motherboard
i believe the be 350 tomahawk was one of
the most if not the most successful be
350 motherboard that msi made so they're
probably hoping to continue that success
with DB 450 tomahawk right now the be
350 version of the tomahawk is selling
for $100 u.s. so this probably won't
come in at that price it'll be probably
a little bit above that but
hopefully it will settle in at the $100
price point before too long I imagine a
lot of you guys are very interested in
the vrm configuration of this board and
I can tell you that it is using a two
plus four phase vrm so pretty skinny
there on the power delivery you wouldn't
want to overclock any Rison seven CPUs
on this board but I imagine you won't
have any problems overclocking horizon
five models like the 26 and the twenty
second directs not the you need to
overclock the 2600 X but if you were
going to the 4.2 you Hertz whatever this
board should be able to do that but of
course that's something we will look
into when we can test it out in about a
week's time and for this particular
model MSI has put passive heat sinks on
both the SOC erm and of the CPU v core
vrm and their decent-sized heat sinks
and they look quite impressive I'll get
some b-roll shots of those but again
we'll see what temps there run out in
the not-too-distant future with a pair
of PCIe x 16 slots though these second
slot is of course only wired for four
times bandwidth and it looks like just a
single m2 port for the audio and
networking we have pretty basic
solutions both our Realtek codec and
controller there so yeah it's probably
suitable for this type of board round on
the i/o panel there's plenty of USB 3
ports and we do have a type C port as
well so that's good to see there and you
also get all six SATA ports though two
of them have been sort of hidden down
the bottom here it'll be nice if they'll
on a 90 degree angle with the rest of
them but whatever and MSI are also
sending along the micro ATX version
called the mortar so we'll be getting
that as well for our day one coverage
that's nice little beater MSI
motherboards the tomahawk and the mortar
so yeah there's our brief look at the
board not much in the package pretty
basic stuff but for the money I think
it's probably going to end up being a
pretty decent motherboard hopefully we
get some decent overclocks
out of those six core rise and CPUs okay
I'll just set that off to the side for
the moment and we'll move this box out
of the way by opening it up and seeing
what's inside blue the old fashioned
jump everything out the box
that was a few light stands with rather
expensive lights on them nevermind okay
what we have here are two more be 450
motherboards of the asrock variety we
have a cute little one here which we'll
look at in a moment and then something
that's probably similar to MSI's be 450
tomahawk and that is as rocks be 450
gaming K for the K 4 series is always
quite good quite a good value for money
and they're sort of standard stuff in
the package CD manual Quick Start Guide
IO shield couple of SATA cables and some
m dot 2 screws pretty typical stuff for
these entry-level boards or probably mid
ranges a better way to describe these
entry-level these sort of your a320s you
know what I mean so we have sort of a
black grey theme similar to the tomahawk
that we just looked at it's a lighter
board it's a bit more bit narrower so a
similar IO configuration on this board
we still get an 8 pin power input there
for the CPU similar SATA port
configuration that the layout is a
little bit different same deal with the
PCI Express x 16 slots the primary slot
is wired for x 16 balance the second
slot is for x for bandwidth and then we
have four times one slots which you can
use for things like sound cards and
upgraded networking and whatever else
may use those connectors then we have a
6 plus three-phase verum and it's
possibly going to disappoint a few of
you guys not surprised others that it is
a three-phase varium with a doubler so
i'm not sure how well that's going to
work whether it's going to be better or
worse than what we see on the msi
tomahawk and something we'll have to
look into but you're definitely not
gonna be overclocking again Rison 7 CPUs
on this board it'll be for your horizon
5 which really does make sense because
if you're spending 300 ish dollars on
your CPU you're not going to be cheeping
out and spending $100 on your
motherboard so the fact that these
boards can really only heavily overclock
the sort of 65 watt models shouldn't
really be a problem then we have the
little mini ITX version the gaming ITX
Pacey and as you would expect we have a
very small motherboard pretty much the
standard package that we've seen so far
from the other two boards but you do get
a pair of antennae for this one for the
Wi-Fi and Bluetooth support and the i/o
shield has got a little design on it
such a bit fancier than the ATX version
okay so tucked away in the back of the
board we find the one and only m2 slot
it's a good place to sort of put it
there on the back of the board the only
downside is in some cases it means you
have to pull the whole motherboard out
just to get to the m2 slot yeah SSD so
that can be annoying but still it makes
sense on these boards because it frees
up a lot of room on the front side of
the board and you just get a better
layout the SATA ports for example
there's four of them there tucked away
nicely here all together we get a decent
heatsink which should do an okay job
again you're not gonna be chucking an
eight core CPU on this and overclocking
the hell out of it that's not going to
go well because again we do have these
same six phases but it's really just a
three-phase VRM so not gonna be yeah
again overclocking the eight core part
on this board but that probably
shouldn't surprise to many of you now
the cool thing about this board is you
do get intel Gigabit LAN not the real
tech and you'll also get the Intel Wi-Fi
and Bluetooth so that's a nice little
combo there for this little entry-level
or I keep saying entry-level I need to
say budget for this budget be 450 mini
ITX motherboard well done cute little
heatsink there on the p450 chipset but I
get overall good looking board this one
keen to try it out and see what it can
do and we'll do that in the
not-too-distant future yeah what do we
go hiding around here we go this one
yeah let's get let's get this out of the
way shall we see what's in here
oh I hate bubble wrap finally got it out
what do we have here is all we saw this
at Computex it's the deep cool castle
all in one a liquid cooler this thing
actually really impressive so the New
Castle series is available in 240
millimeter or two 80 millimeter variants
and it looks like we have the 240
millimeter version here it might pay to
send your products in actual boxes so
the Box doesn't get so beaten up anyway
and it's better for unboxing boxes so in
this box here we get all the mounting
hardware and this does support a m4 and
all the latest Intel platforms actually
I believe this also supports the tr4
socket that's supposed to have pretty
large base plate on this cooler so it
gives good coverage on the tr4 socket
look exceptionally large but they are
advertising it to offer full tr4
coverage so yeah there's something to
look into and check out obviously we've
got like the reservoir and the pump
housing here is quite large it has a
mirror finish on top which has some
interesting or provides some interesting
effects via the RGB LEDs that are
embedded in it RGB of course and also
included in the package to whack on your
radiator or a pair of their hydro
bearing fans and these guys of course
RGB lit as well
they've got separate RGB connectors
that'll go into a controller that will
be in that other box that we looked at a
moment ago some nice sleeved cables or
hoses that run from the radiator to the
block and there's crimped off nicely
they seem quite flexible looking at it
like this doesn't really do it justice
but I will plug this in and I'll add
some b-roll to this video so you can get
a good look at what it actually looks
like and then hopefully and the
not-too-distant future I can feature
this in a build week and see how well it
actually works and just quickly for
those of you that were wondering that
love your Achebe goodness all the igb
lighting for the castle is addressable
so you can do that on the soos or a sink
it works on I believe MSI mystic
lighting the asrock stuff so work should
work on your motherboard via
pretty much gonna do it for this one I
can't tell you too much more about it
without plugging in seeing how the
installation process goes and
performance and all that sort of stuff
price-wise that's probably something I
can talk about I don't know us
availability or pricing it doesn't
appear to be available in the US so if
someone in the u.s. knows of somewhere
we can buy it let me know I'll put that
in the description below but right now
it is a hundred and seventy dollars
Australian which is up there but it's
not outrageous so yeah that's pretty
much what you can expect to pay for the
higher-end 240 millimeter all-in-one
liquid coolers but yeah I'll give it a
go let you guys know how good it is all
right let's get this little box out of
the way see what it has to offer you
ready why don't we go why don't I have
to try and break everything okay
interesting
well it looks like we have a pair of
passive heat sinks from Arctic looks
like one's for your Intel CPUs and then
one's for AMD Verizon AM for well you
take take a look at these guys I don't
know what to expect to you okay so what
we have here is a big old chunk of
aluminium basically it looks like it's
anodized or it's taking a bit of a ding
in the corner there which has been
annoying anyway it'll still work yeah
they were pretty tightly packaged in
that box that looks like someone's
probably used the box as a football
there's the base of it there's all your
fins and so this is designed to work on
4347 what is the maximum TDP that
they're rated for and that would be full
passive mode so pretty poor airflow that
I'd be expecting for that so if you add
it if you're sort of pushing a fair bit
of air across this it would work on much
higher rated CPUs but if you're using it
now you have full passive design which I
suppose is what it's intended for 47
watts is the maximum amount of heat you
can hope to disperse with this
efficiently weighs half a kilogram 508
grams
and yeah it's quite big so I don't know
how compatibility goes but anyway I'm
definitely going to try this out and I'm
particularly interested in the a m4
version so this one seem like it's any
bigger though oops
the base is slightly larger so that
probably makes it slightly heavier you
can see there that the the base there is
a bit a large chunk there of aluminium
and it looks like you can orient this
thing either that away or that away in
your case looking at the mounts on the
bottom there so that's kind of handy
depending on which way the air is
flowing in the case you can you can turn
it around fact that it is square makes
that relatively easy to do we have some
pre applied famil piece that I'm trying
very hard not to touch normally I do
touch that kind of stuff
and this one doesn't have any real dings
in it so that's kind of nice it was just
the Intel one that got beat up in
transit a very similar sort of thing be
interesting to see how this guy's on
something like the horizon 320 200 G I
just quickly checked on my phone I
jumped over the Arctic website and these
things are selling for just $13 u.s.
each so that's a fair chunk of aluminium
F $13 I mean the mounting stuff's pretty
basic and that's all you need 13 dollars
for that and it's probably better at the
Intel Box cooler I don't know we'll find
out in time okay and we're now down to
the last box I actually know there is a
package on the top of it so we'll check
that out just quickly this one is from a
viewer but little learning a little
loony I think is the nickname on that
one yeah thank you but I'm not sure what
you've sent me but it's come all the way
from the US so we'll have a look at
what's in here
I do recall someone but evidently
saying they wanted to send me a flexible
pci express riser cable to benchmark and
see what the latencies like on how well
it works look at this thing
I've got one of these laying around
somewhere that was quite expensive so I
think this one is meant to be quite
affordable easy do-it-yourself PCI
Express flexible high speed riser cable
25 centimetres long okay well it looks
very similar to the thermal take ones
that aren't any good but apparently this
one is meant to be pretty good so I
should say that it was the original
thermal fat ones that weren't very good
apparently Thermaltake did end up fixing
that but they didn't send it to me to
test out so okay I have I bought this
one for a hundred and twenty Australian
dollars this is I think the Lian Li
version I can't recall it was about two
years ago now when I bought it as you
can see I'm not using it anymore
but this worked perfectly fine no dramas
at all yeah this one I mean it looks
pretty good so and I'll give that a go
and I'll let you know how it compares to
the LAN Li one might try and get a
couple of other riser cables and do a a
riser cable round up so that could be
something fun to do in the near future
okay now I am down to the very last box
now they're missing this episode random
Asian drinks we have to tea that up
again for the next episode of unboxing
boxes that was a bit of fun and it sort
of broke up the the products being
unboxed okay so this is a heavy box sent
from Logitech well it says logitech on
it so I'm just going to assure me that
it was sent by Logitech
oK we've got some things in plastic bags
two of them look like keyboards in a
while since we've checked out a keyboard
on unboxing boxes megablast that sounds
pretty cool maybe we'll check out the
mega blast first let's do that alright
so this is from Yui and Yui make some of
the coolest Bluetooth speakers that I've
checked out really good stuff and this
one is big and heavy and it's called the
mega blast so currently mean one thing
that's really lay out let's find out
pretty funky looking package of design
there once you take that thing off and
here we go
okay looks like the boom but bigger what
it's very heavy also included in the
package is a really cool slimline
microUSB a zoom charging cable
yes charging cable here's the charger so
it's a 12 volt one-and-a-half amp or 9
volt 2 amp charger one of the two so
that's what you get in the package you
get your charger your charging cable and
the speaker itself and I have the black
version
I usually these things come in a whole
heap of colors but I've got the black
one this time now we've also got an
accessory that has been included and
this is like a little charging dock it
looks like based on the picture so the
UE mega blast isn't a budget speaker
it's about 250 US or 380 Australians so
very high-end but it does have something
like 16 hours of playback and a holy bit
drivers in it we'll get to that in a
minute
I'll just have a quick look at this dock
that we have here
right so in the bottom here we have this
little screw and normally when you undo
that well the point of that is you can
remove this little rubber washer and
then you can access the charging port at
the bottom plug the cable in like so and
then this is in the wall and it charges
your speaker up or you can leave this in
place without actually having to remove
it ever if I can find out how it goes
back in done you can put this screw in
and this one is different because it has
a little gold contact in the middle and
that works when you sit it on the
charging pad so that's pretty simple you
just sit it it's pretty easy tool and
roughly in the middle sits on there and
then your cable for your charger will
plug into this so they put that on your
desk
charge your speaker take it off its
mobile back on the charger so that's a
nice little accessory I don't know how
much that actually cost so I have to
find out and put that in the video
description but I do like that accessory
makes it a bit more convenient then we
have the speaker itself and as you can
see it is a big sucker see it's gonna
charge in at the moment
indeed it does hi there
please download the Ultimate Ears app on
your mobile device to set up your
speaker okay thank you I will do that
shortly
so good 360-degree sound
it's really nice when out loud it goes
well that sounds very nice indeed very
very nice and it is ip67 waterproof and
dustproof so you can take it outside
it's designed to be used by the pool or
take it wherever you go outside and it
should be able to survive the elements
quite well
you can even submerge it in a liquid
it'll go one metre down for up to thirty
minutes without dying so that's handy
you want to listen to it underwater now
what you were hearing just a moment ago
are the two 25 millimeter tweeters it
also has two 55 millimeter active
drivers and then it has two 85
millimeter by 50 millimeter at passive
radiators so yeah combine all those
things together and you have yourself a
pretty impressive Bluetooth speaker
paint for any of you interested I'll
have a link in the video description so
you can check it out and see if it's
worth buying possibly my new favorite
Bluetooth speaker that all right and we
have some keyboards it's like I said
it's been quite some time since you have
to mark keyboards and unboxing boxes
there used to be a staple of the series
and it's been a while all right we'll
skip over the gaming keyboard for a
moment and we will look at the craft the
Logitech craft because this keyboard is
a bit different but interesting it's
designed for your creative types all
your professionals that use sort of the
adobe suite software now it's all
because of the creative input dial and
we'll get to that in a moment and check
it out but yeah it's quite different you
don't find this sort of thing on a lot
of keyboards so I suppose we should
probably get in have a look for those of
you wondering
it's $180 u.s. or 280 dollars Australian
so it's not a cheap keyboard by any
means but they are targeting as I said
the professional types with it it's very
slim it takes advantage of Logitech's
unifying Wi-Fi technology so you little
dongle here you can plug that in to
promote any device with USB otherwise it
also supports bluetooth which is a nifty
little addition
this top beat he is aluminium I can tell
because it's freezing in this room
because this room's cold and the dial
also seems to be aluminium so that's
very nice this is very cool to charge
the keyboard you can use a type-c
connector very nice indeed of course it
is type-a at this end but you could get
a typesetter type-c cable I suppose if
you wanted to right in the top left
corner here we can find the creative
input dial which can be clicked and it
can be rotated left or right and it has
a very not Qi feel to it audible sound
Logitech software does offer integration
for the Adobe suite so you've got
Photoshop Illustrator Premiere
InDesign and other software like
Microsoft Word PowerPoint Excel and then
a few other things like QuickTime Safari
Google Chrome and Spotify so there's
plenty of applications that you can use
this knob to control and speed up your
workflow again it is meant for
professionals and creative types but
casual users can also take advantage of
this keyboard and it will help you
switching between apps quicker or
changing the volume up or down in
Spotify all kinds of things like that
there's many purposes of the creative
dial beyond that though you just get a
low profile keyboard it's I've got a bit
of a clicky feel to it sort of a step up
from what you would find on a laptop I
suppose there's no feet but the back is
slightly raised so it's not a not a
seriously aggressive angle of attack but
still comfortable enough because it is
so thin it sits very flat flatly
flattish it's very flat on your desk and
because of that it's if I find it very
ergonomic you don't need you know you've
been sort of wrist rest at the gaming
keyboards often there but those really
raised keys and often they're a bit
chunkier as well those Cherry MX
switches and things like that be a very
very slim line and very comfortable to
use I actually really like the feel of
it so I'm keen to give that a go later
on and finally a gaming focused keyboard
there's not many of those about and this
one uses the romaji
tactile switches the g5 12 carbon so
pretty sweet looking keyboard it looks
again
looks pretty compact actually I should
also note that the keys aren't backlit
on this particular model whereas they
are on this one and it's a gaming
keyboard you know it's RGB backlit of
course it is already I can tell you it's
a very similar design to the other
Logitech RGB keyboards that we've looked
at before pair of type a USB ports so
that means that we'll have passed
through and there is the port for
pass-through so you can plug your mouse
into your keyboard or flash media
whatever it is that you want to use the
back of the keyboard is pretty typical
of what we've seen before there's some
cable routing here for your mouse and
then you've got some feet single-stage
feet so you can flip them up quite a
nice angle again though you will I would
personally want to use this with a wrist
rest it just sits up a bit too high for
me to use like this for long periods of
time my hands would get a bit sore the
g5 12 is available with a few different
switch options so you've got the romaji
tactile which I have here there's also
the Roma gr linear switches and then
you've just got the GX blue switch as
well so there's a few options there
let's see what happens we plug this in
by default we get the nice rainbow
effect but of course using the Logitech
software you can configure many
different zones of lighting and effects
and all that kind of stuff that you
would expect to see and then on top here
protecting the keyboard we have some
brushed aluminium it's probably aircraft
grade aluminium no doubt because you
know coke can aluminium just won't cut
it here but it's quite it's a few mil
thick it feels quite good gives it a bit
of strength that takes there's very
little flex in this cable it's very
solid nice and durable so yeah really
keen to give this one a go as well I'll
probably play with the craft first
because this is just very unique looking
and I think I'll really enjoy that one
with premier but anyway so it looks like
we've done pretty well out of this
episode of unboxing boxes got myself a
new Bluetooth speaker might be
new favorite Bluetooth speaker got a new
gaming keyboard got a potentially new
favorite keyboard not sure about that
one yet and then of course the B 450
motherboards and I really like the Mini
ITX model here and I have to say the msi
tomahawk looks really good as well and
i'm interesting how that four-phase
veeram goes with the horizon 520 600 X
so that should be good hopefully won't
be too long I think it's about a week
and a half before you'll see any
benchmarking with these motherboards on
the channel but considering how long you
have waited what's another week and a
half but anyway that is going to do it
for this episode of unboxing boxes hope
you guys enjoyed and I will see you on
the channel again soon for more content
because we have another video tomorrow
that after the day after that I think we
have a video planned pretty much every
day for the next 4 weeks so we're gonna
be busy but anyway I should get back to
it and yeah again hope you guys enjoyed
it I'm your host Steve see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
