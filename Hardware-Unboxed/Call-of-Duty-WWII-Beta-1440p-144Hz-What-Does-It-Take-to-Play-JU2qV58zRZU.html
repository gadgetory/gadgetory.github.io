welcome back to harbor unbox for another
what does it take to play episode now
typically with these episodes we look at
optimal hardware configurations for
playing a newly released title and
that'll give you guys up rating to play
the title in question a pretty good idea
of what kind of hardware you'll need
with call of duty at World War 2 we had
a look at the meter over the weekend and
we decided that since it is only the
beta phase and for those of you unaware
the beta opened on September 29th that
will be open til October 2nd on Steam
but since it is only in that stage and
it's not a retail version yet we decided
to check out how it plays on high-end
hardware that said though I do also have
some advice for those of you using
lesser Hardware as well so I'll discuss
that shortly for now though I'm most
worried to admit that I did have a bit
of fun playing this over the weekend
it's been a long time since I spent much
time playing a Call of Duty title but I
thought this one was okay now like I
said I ended up having quite a bit of
fun playing it the reason I'm worried to
admit that though is because of the
overwhelmingly negative feedback this
titles were saved from gamers steam is
full of mostly negative reviews at the
time of putting this video together was
something like 4,000 positive reviews
which was overshadowed by some 11,000
negative reviews assuming though that
you didn't hate the game when you even
plan on getting it when it's released
and this is the kind of performance you
can expect to find those hoping to game
at 1440p on a high refresh rate monitor
and don't want to compromise on quality
you'll need at least a geforce gtx 1070
or radeon RX vega 56 graphics card
though that's probably not that
surprising those of you who are rocking
higher in GPU such as the ones i just
mentioned you will want to cpu
supporting 8 threads the core i7 7700
cables around 60% faster than the core
i5 7600 k the quad core Core i5 would
often dip below 60fps whereas the core
i7 never dropped below 100 FPS the rise
in CPUs though they also did do very
well at least those with 8 threads or
more and I'll show that in a moment
for now though we're looking at the core
i7 77 okay paired with a GeForce GTX
1080 Ti at 1440p with the visual quality
settings maxed out as you might expect
this combo delivered very smooth
gameplay though it's well worth knowing
that utilization was often seen hovering
around 70% that means the core i5 and
other quad core CPUs are going to have a
rough time in this style especially when
paired with a high-end graphics card
over the course of the five-minute match
this Hardware combo never dipped below
109 fps and averaged 136 fps and of
course this is at 1440p using the
maximum in-game quality settings out of
interest though I thought I might check
out how the risin 5 1500 X handles this
title under the same conditions after
another 5 minute match on the same map
the minimum recorded frame rate was 94
fps with an average of 128 fps that's
only 6 percent slower than a 77 okay
which I thought was mighty impressive
for AMD's $190 quad-core for those
wanting to maintain over 60 FPS at all
times at 1440p you will still require
something like a gtx 1070 gtx 980ti or
Vega 56 if you're a little less picky
and you can live with around a 60 FPS
average then the gtx 1060 radeon RX 4 75
74 85 80 all the fury X GPUs will work
well for those of you gaming at 1080p
anything equal to or faster and say the
RX 470 or GTX 1063 gigabyte will deliver
over 60 FPS at all times although the
game is very demanding you still can get
the most out of every range GPU with
something like the Verizon 3 1200 though
be aware any CPU offering just 4 threads
will be maxed out pretty much all the
time in this title much like what we see
with battlefield 1 so if you're using a
GPU with a bit more room an 8 threaded
CPU will be required
finally it's also worth noting that if
you're seeing a lot of stuttering make
sure you have 16 gigabytes of system
memory installed again this is the same
story with battlefield won the game
regularly consumed over 8 gigabytes of
system memory and often went past 9
gigabytes
at 1440p the game also allocated up to 9
gigabytes of vram when available so it's
a bit of a memory Pig be aware of that
though we were using the ex
quality settings well that's gonna do it
for this one that's all the testing I've
done so far I won't have any time for
big benchmark video like what I do with
the destiny to beta it's gonna be a
pretty busy week as it is so with the
game pretty poorly received at this
point I don't know how much demand there
would have been for a big benchmark
video anyway and so though once the game
is officially released I will check it
out in more detail until then I'm your
host Steve see you again next time guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
