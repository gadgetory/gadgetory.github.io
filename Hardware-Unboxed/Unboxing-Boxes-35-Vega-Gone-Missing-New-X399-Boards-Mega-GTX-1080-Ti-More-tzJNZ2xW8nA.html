box for another episode of unboxing
boxes as you can see the boxes are
assumed piling up believe in art this
isn't even all of them I haven't been
other ten boxes just over here so we're
not going to get through all these today
I'm going to pick five of what I think
will probably be the cooler more
exciting boxes that we have so we'll get
through those first yeah
let's clean the desk up get the five
boxes we're going to unbox and we'll go
from there all right so we've narrowed
it down to five what I think will be
exciting boxes packages some good stuff
inside can't be guaranteed but odds are
with us with five of the boxes and we
have the garbage bag boxes and they they
always deliver the garbage bag boxes and
I know what it is about them but they
look rubbish and they're just gold mines
so speaking of which we should probably
actually I will save them because they
are good usually now we've got a Galax
box here and they also always deliver
because Galax really only makes one
thing and that is a graphics card and
this box is it's taken a beating so
hopefully hopefully I doesn't seem very
well padded
come on Galax stop cheeping out on us mm
well this box has absolutely no padding
whatsoever and it's not a cheap product
that's what we're looking at GTX 3gi
with no padding but there's obviously
padding inside the product box so the
graphics card should be relatively
unharmed
let's have a quick look at this guy and
then we'll move on because I've got a
lot to get through and I do have
a little bit of a funny story or no if
it's funny just I have a story to tell
about my Vegas sample at the end of the
video it's slightly entertaining so
anyway we'll discuss that shortly okay
galux GTX 1080i so in the package you
get the usual four pin the 6 pin
connector you get an 8 pin - 4 pin
connector and a DVI to HDMI dongle the
manual is no 25 graphics card time whoo
I've been trying to get a galaxy gtx
980ti 4 month town a month very similar
to the 1070 this is the ax OSI model and
I have looked at the 1070 xoc and it was
an awesome card
this one the shroud the complaint a lot
of people had which didn't bother me too
much but it was true that there's shroud
was it was a white model that the shroud
was more cream than white it was like an
off-white and yeah some people didn't
like that it glowed quite nicely but
this one is very white this is about as
white as white gets and that back plate
wolf pretty fancy
some aggressive cut out there caution
hot surface so what can I say about this
card well it looks like we have five
very fat copper heat pipes so decent
cooler on there for sure looks like two
big banks of aluminium fins we have a
eight pin and a 6 pin power inputs
that's pretty standard for a 10 atti
standard sort of our I oh stuff their
connectivity pair of fans there probably
about 100 mil I really like these white
cards the black PCB they look cool in
like my tower 900 building to be really
at home in there even though that's
mostly liquid cool but anyway so I think
the highlights of the cooler are the 5
copper heat pipes it is a 12 layered PCB
so it's a very thick PCV very premium
and it also has a 7 phase power design
so you're going to squeeze pretty much
all you can out of the 10 a DTI GPU on
this graphics card when it's air-cooled
anyway yeah very cool card been trying
this
while keen to do a review on this mostly
focusing on things like thermal and
overclocking all that kind of stuff
yeah that's a cool card where shall I
put this
stay stay don't knock that off straight
away all right why it's a good start
there you go Daleks 1080 Ti great way to
start today's unboxing boxes episode
let's see what else we have I forgot to
put this stuff back in the box take two
everything's back in the box
put the box there it's important that I
keep everything together with the
unboxing boxes seriously I get to the
end of episode there's stuff everywhere
I have no idea what goes where it's
actually quite embarrassing the studio
over here there's there's kind of stuff
that never got filed away correctly so
it's just there's a pile of
miscellaneous bits and bobs oh that's a
heavy one actually let's start with I
had this a bit of a bit of a story to
this one so this is the first time this
has happened a very exciting one of the
garbage bags is from a patreon member so
Levi has purchased something from I
think was PC case gear now he messaged
me a few weeks ago and he said Steve I'm
buying something pretty cool how would
you feel about me having it sent to your
place you can unbox it unboxing boxes
show it off and then when you're done
you can even review it or whatever and
then pass it on to me so that sounds
like a very cool offer indeed he
promised it is not that I cared I'd
unbox anything but he promised it was
something very exciting so I was like
sure let's do it so this has arrived
just the other day late last week this
is Sunday morning right now you're
probably watching this Sunday afternoon
all those guys that jump on it straight
away
so what has Levi had sent my way quite
heavy let's get into it
uh-oh okay that's quite funny I don't
know if you guys can see it whoa
okay Wow Wow
I've been trying to get my hands on this
thing for many months as well you'll see
why I was a bit shocked at first oh that
is the Daleks Hall of Fame GTX and a GTI
Wow Levi that is a seriously cool
graphics card I saw when I opened the
box I basically saw that the tops in
Celtx GTX 1080i and I thought it was
that and I thought don't tell me he's
got super excited to send me his brand
new graphics card and I just unboxed one
but no this is even better again next
level whoa yeah I've genuinely been
trying to get my hands on one of these
and I just haven't had samples so I'm
going to be careful with this more
careful a lot more careful that I
normally am I'll be treating this with
respect crease the box a little bit so
about that okay normally I just rip
things apart don't really care a bit
more entertaining but with this one I
don't really want to break his box oh
okay oh okay
do that again I've worked it all out I
think you're right dirty
it's like magnet or something
try again ready well I'm nervous I do
not want to damage this thing no I
really don't care that ya really
appreciate the thing sent in wow wow wow
what a beast wow that's the back of it
this is a very very heavy graphics card
much like that MSI Lightning was I have
to say this looks even cooler so you've
got an LED display there she'll talk
about the moment well thank you very
much for sending this in Levi I'll try
and get done with it as quickly as
possible I'm not sure I'll give it a
dedicated review I'd like to the only
thing is I'm not going to be able to
pull this card down because like I said
it is a viewers card so I don't want to
avoid their warranty or risk damaging
the card or anything like that so yeah
we won't be a teardown or anything like
that I'm still going to try and get one
of these from Galax especially now that
I've seen how amazing the card looks but
yeah I'll do some thermal testing and
stuff like that because I have to pull
the part to do all that we'll play a few
games on it and stuff like that I don't
know too much about this I certainly
wasn't expecting to get the Hall of Fame
card but I know this to be pretty much
one of the most highly regarded and
respected 1080p eyes by overclockers it
has a I've got this rising it's a 12
phase or twelve plus three phase VRM so
very beefy vrm and as you can see it
does have 3/8 pin PCI Express power
input so that's the same as what the MSI
Lightning Z has it's got a white or sort
of a whitish or a silverish PCB it's
obviously got a silver backplate
massive massive why since our plastic
the plastic here so it's got some now
it's all plastic I think it's got some
LED highlights it looks like looks like
this is the Crown's other parts LED it's
like I'm almost like translucent silicon
that and then you have an LCD display
the LCDs display I imagine will give you
various statistic readout so you can see
things like the GPU frequency the memory
frequency things like voltages probably
certainly temperatures all that kind of
cool information obviously the card in
most cases will be horizontal so in like
that and you can read the display like
that yeah Wow yeah so a very very
impressive 1082 I'm probably the most
impressive I've seen so far certainly
one of the most impressive so big thank
you to Levi for setting that in and I'm
keen to play a few games on it and run a
few temperature tests and things like
that I won't say how much
Levi paid for it but you guys can
probably work it out for yourselves it
is selling for about fourteen hundred
Ozzie at the moment and about 1,100 u.s.
so an extremely expensive premium 1080
CI but it's going to be blistering fast
and enable high refresh rate gaming or
high resolution gaming or whatever you
like yeah I'll put that neatly aside
somewhere safe well so far we have to
1080i so one thing's for sure the next
episode of unboxing boxes is probably
not going to be that exciting I don't
think we can top that even the box is
highly impressive those are the way it
opens with those magnetic sort of doors
is pretty cool honestly where do you go
from there
well we've got an msi box you just wrap
the hell out of it so it's not a palette
of tiles ms i don't think this is
necessary
yes it is it is what was advertised on
the outside a very cool indeed very cool
indeed and I slid it out the wrong way
around but you kind of get the idea
x3 99 gaming Pro carbon a/c Wow
I was supposed to get this board for the
main thread' River review which is a few
days ago now but MSI had a few shipping
problems didn't get it to me in time so
now I'm going to have to do a few other
things with it I do plan to build myself
a thread Ripper editing rig and I think
this will be the board I'll use having
settled that we should probably take a
look okay so we have the AC or ëifí
PCI Express x one adapter with the card
on it we have a high bandwidth SLI
bridge but just a sort of standard
looking naked PCB one but it's got a
cool dragon on it so there you go we
have what I okay this is so you can
customize the look of the board I can
open it okay well this goes with the
board we have a little baggie with many
things inside we have some motherboard
standoffs a USB cable Wi-Fi antenna RGB
cables custom IO shield SATA cables can
just just sort of general step stuff you
can expect if at the motherboard use the
guide a roller art let's have a little
board itself oh and there's a little
nice badge
well that is a pretty cool-looking
motherboard that's an impressive looking
very I'm heat sink there and it actually
has fins Wow
and the capacitors on the back even have
a heat spreader as well so that's pretty
cool in the back of the vrm help deal
with a bit of built-up heat on the
backside straight away you'll see that
you just have USB 3 ports for days looks
like there's ten of them ten on the i/o
panel another four viol onboard headers
looks like there's just the two headers
are the 3m 2 slots look quite impressive
they've got their sort of their MDOT two
heat shields where's a screwdriver so
look if they're improved on the previous
design okay so you've got a six thermal
pad that runs the length of the card it
may work well anyway we'll test that out
and find out in the future not in an
unboxing boxes episode so yeah you have
the i/o armor on the DIMM slots and the
PCI Express x 16 slots and I think
that's about it yeah it looks very
unique very cool there'll be a fair bit
of RGB lighting there mystic lighting
going on the audio solution looks to be
quite impressive so you have some
Neutrik on gold caps there it's probably
a real tech probably a 12 2002 F I'd say
to guess I don't know for sure
pair of eight pin PCI a so why am I
saying PCI pair of eight pin CPU power
inputs then you've obviously got the
standard 24 pin there's a six pin and
that's probably a PCI Express power
input there so a bit a bit more power to
the PCIe slots help stabilize overclocks
and whatnot eight SATA ports no you got
to port by the looks of it and I believe
it's a thirteen phase of erm on this
board so I should allow to hit that
magical 4 gigahertz overclock on your
1950 X or 1920 X whatever you go with
and yeah really cool-looking board
obviously you've got that massive tr4
socket which is why the board's so heavy
like every single one of these boards is
x3 ninety nine boards and there's the
back side of it so yeah pretty cool
board it has a heap of fan headers and
heap of everything really price-wise I
believe it's something like 370 ish us
and 640 Australian so yeah it's a pricey
board but it's a high-end you know
workstation gaming if you will about
gaming in the name but anyone who's
buying thread ripper just for gaming has
a bit of a screw loose it's no doubt
good at gaming but like I said in my
review if you just gaming via a core i7
7700 K and if you've got a heap of money
where you can afford a thousand dollar
processor you can afford all this crazy
gear to build yourself a thread Ripper
system chances are you can also afford
to build core i7 7700 K systems to build
yourself to computers and yet anyway
cool board we'll move on because we do
have a lot to get through
yeah can you use that board in a build
very soon and move far and also in here
which I forgot to look at so dragging
this out you can see we have the carbon
highlights here in here so you can
change them through silver or goals at
the moment it's sort of a black silver
look you can go with stronger silver
accents or you can go for a bit of pimp
and gold if that's your thing
alright well we've already had a
high-end motherboard to tune a TTI's it
wouldn't be an unboxing boxes episode
without a keyboard so I have included
suspiciously shaped package once again
another keyboard shaped package how do I
open this without cutting the product
all right looking but I can even beat a
keyboard it's a new keyboard suffer I
suppose this is the new HyperX hourly
elite and I have I did actually request
this not touch for review just to unbox
it and show you guys this one is the
Cherry MX red switches and their
original their first ever keyboard from
Kingston was their HyperX alloy and that
was a fantastic quality keyboard really
nice really subtle design for a gaming
focused keyboard the only problem was
the price I don't know if they got bit
more competitive on the price but the
pricing was a bit ludicrous last to say
for the original alloy it's like the
fact that it was a really good quality
keyboard this one I think it's a hundred
and ten us which is certainly
significantly more reasonable I think
the previous one was over 150 us that
was much more basic than this one is
despite being higher quality so 110
dollars us I believe for this model and
I don't think it's in Australia I don't
have any Australian pricing but let's
take a look quite weighty very good okay
so it looks like it comes with some
textured WASD and a couple of numbered
key capsule the key cat remover and
that's something I believe Corsair
started doing that first but I could be
wrong it looks very much like the
textured Corsair key caps we're used to
seeing I'm very very happy to see that
we do have a detachable wrist rest this
in my opinion is a must for all
keyboards over $100 u.s. it's a really
nice one it's got a sort of a smooth
sleek kind of plastic sort of feel there
but that's got a really rubberized grip
e texture for your ladies palms would
see when you're typing so that's cool
well this is definitely going to find
its way onto my desk today as a
dedicated keyboard for a while I really
really like to look at it this is a that
clips on I like it when they are they
actually are attached but they move a
bit so when you drag the keyboard around
your desk it doesn't come off constantly
that's really irritating when they do
that and very thick braided cable but it
it is thick for a reason which I'll get
to in a minute as we can see a really
really nice clean keyboard it's not sort
of its game rush without being
over-the-top looking like it's got you
know things hangin all off it so some
dedicated media buttons up here which
are nice got a volume scroll wheel and I
use the volume scroll wheel a lot on my
g.skill keyboard I love it the g.skill
keyboards a bit more bit more childish a
bit more game or even though I really
like using the keyboard I wish it was a
little more sedate certainly like this
one is we have the volume wheel
something I do love and use a lot now
we've got some brightness buttons up
here and a few other sort of custom
buttons apart from that the layout looks
pretty standard it is it is an RGB this
one it's so it's got the cherry MX red
switches and it's red backlit so kind of
following the color scheme of the HyperX
range which is black and red so black
keyboard red backlighting complementing
the red backlighting there is a red well
there's a bar a translucent strip across
the top here and that glows red so they
may have borrowed that one from Corsair
as well a bit like the R key caps but
anyway kurz there think the k95 platinum
was the first keyboard feature a light
bulb should I be corrected if it wasn't
but it's the first one I was aware of
and now we're seeing them much more
commonly used and doesn't do anything
it's just aesthetic yeah just for
aesthetics it looks quite nice I've can
see it on the box there you will
probably seen it as I'm talking about it
actually it just occurred to me because
I will later throught some b-roll as I
often do but yes we've got some key cap
backlighting a nice strip to be a bit
eye-catching and then around the back
here the reason why this cable this
Brailey table is so thick is because
it's a pair of USB cable so one is for
the keyboard and the other
is a pass-through and I don't know if I
don't think they're actually labeled
which is a little bit annoying no so you
kind of have to guess all ones white
ones black so probably say in the manual
which ones which but yeah it's not
obvious just looking at the cables but
you do have a USB to pass through so you
can you know route your mouse into their
stuff like that it's not really good for
USB sticks unless they're on the USB too
but anyway I passed through which is
always a very welcome addition to any
high-end mechanical keyboard and you a
nice thick braided cable some people
don't like the stick cables but it does
have a pair of USB two is going through
it so somewhat justified around the back
here we have two feet just a one-stage
height on the feet there there
they look like they're quite
high-quality feet they snap place quite
well and they're down if you push the
keyboard back and they don't fold away
or forward good so basically with this
keyboard if you want to push it back
because you want to see something in
front of you you can do that and the
wrist rest stays attached and the feet
stay in whichever position you have them
but I'm just finally here very durable
keyboard we have a aluminium cover over
the whole face of the cable which makes
it a bit more rigid thick more durable
and it looks really nice
should make cleaning a bit easier as
well and yeah it is very weighty I
believe it's around one and a half kilos
so it's about 1500 grams so yeah very
nice quality keyboard it's not
ridiculously thicker or anything from a
mechanical keyboard it's yeah rather
slim and yeah I'm going to go plug that
in and give it a shot I really like that
what are we up to the last box that's
gone quickly I think all right see what
we got here I've got to try and cut
these garbage bags that cutting whatever
in the must think I've found a bit of a
gap
we have something quite nice here I
think I should make it a rule for
unboxing boxes boxes only I hate these
plastic things they do take up less room
in my office when I've dealt with them
but still we're getting there guys
we're getting there well I don't really
need to say too much that's what that is
and looks like it's up okay and it has
its opposition in a way well this has
been a very cool unboxing boxes episode
because now we have the gigabyte or SX
399 gaming 7 and we also have the do
gabite or sx $2.99 gaming 9 the gaming
nine is a crazy impressive board I
haven't seen the x3 99 gaming 7 model
but just briefly looking at that on the
box it looks like a very impressive
motherboard as well you guys probably
want to see the x3 99 the most so let's
take a look at that so this board
retails for $399 it's something like 620
Aussie dollars so very expensive
motherboard all the x 399 boards are
very expensive at the moment slightly
more than the x2 99 s but I expect
pricing to sort of come in line with the
X 299 board ZL pre much the same for
either the X 299 or X 399 okay so quick
a look at what we get with this one so
we get another high bandwidth SLI bridge
just a pcr naked PCB version we get a
little sort of allen key type wrench
thing but it's for the it's a Torx
socket thing that's for installing the
CPU in the tr4 socket so normally you
get that with your Rison 3
Percy bu-but gigabyte of included one in
case you lose it or whatever we have
some velcro straps we have a pair of it
looks like thermal sensors there's one
there's the other one we have a very
cool-looking custom looking i/o shield
what we have here it looks like a and an
antenna for the probably 802 11 AC Wi-Fi
a couple of standoffs looks like there
m2 standoffs
so you can probably adjust those what do
we got here some RGB cables there's two
of those the thermal sensor and two a
pair of SATA cables and that's 2 SATA
cables with this rather expensive
motherboard but whatever and then you
get stickers okay it's a shame we don't
feature the gigabyte boards on the
hardware box channel more often because
I have to say gigabyte right now
producing what are arguably some of the
best-looking motherboards on the market
right now and this is probably the
best-looking x3 99 board I've seen so
far it's a mighty impressive it looks
really well-made as well like the the
heat sinks are actually proper heat
sinks so they should do a good job of
cooling and yes super feature-rich
some really really nice features on this
board actually so you've got built onto
the board so it's not an expansion card
which I quite like as that Intel dual
band 802 11 AC Wi-Fi so that's cool you
also get the realtek ALC 1220 or do
codec and down here you can see these
red WI ma audio capacitors so they're
quite high and impressive you also go
high and any impressive I don't I'm
saying and you get those Nietzsche con
goals audio caps as well and that will
be probably on an isolated section of
the PCB there'll be or probably head so
amp it's called amp up audio so I'm sure
there's some sort of headphone amp and
stuff built in there as well so that's
no doubt going to be a very good audio
solution along with the Intel Wi-Fi you
also get it's a single Gigabit Ethernet
connector on this one but it is a killer
Ethernet thing so the I think it's the
e25 hundred yeah I mean they work well
they're a bit overrated the killer
Ethernet stuff I prefer the Intel stuff
myself but it works well enough
something I really like about this board
is that has a seriously large amount of
fan headers so there are eight fan
headers in total and gigabyte call them
their high bridge fan headers because
six of them come with temperature probe
sort of inputs next to them or adjacent
from the fan header so that's cool and
then two of them are designed to put out
a bit more amperage for things like
water pumps so they weren't below your
header up when you plug something that
draws a bit too much current so that's
very cool and there are at least one or
two or three temperature probes included
in the package so that's good so you can
use those and on board something very
cool as well on board are nine probes
built onto this motherboard so you can
monitor things like the CPU socket the
vrm probably the SSDs the chipset
temperature things like that so nine
strategically located temperature
sensors so if you want to know where
they are you can probably hop over to
the gigabyte website and they'll have a
little illustration there of where they
all are I'm talking of the m dot two
slots we do have three of them so there
there there and there and they have very
impressive looking heat spreaders on
them
so they're obviously designed to stop
the m dot two drives from throttling
we've seen very success with these
designs I haven't tested anything from
gigabyte yet so I'm pretty keen a
chucker samsung 960 pro in there see how
that goes so yeah that's a quick look a
bit of an overview of the gigabyte Oris
gaming what is it was 7 yes the 7 so
yeah very cool motherboard very
expensive motherboard I'm not sure what
I'll do with this board it's the MSI one
my personal build but I'm going to have
to do a build with this board as well
because yeah it's really cool I might do
some
testing on those MDOT - heat spreader
shield type things as well so there you
go all right we probably should check
out the X 299 board and then I'll tell
you a little bit about what I think's
going on with my Vega sample which sadly
I don't have as we speak so yeah anyway
this is a much bigger box even heavier
so I'm not sure what extras you're
getting this one yeah it's a very
similar-looking motherboard equally
impressive obviously you put the LGA
2066 socket on this one Wow okay that's
probably one of the reasons why it's so
heavy you have a massive aluminium
backplate look at that on the back of
this thing so there's no thermal pads or
anything it's just it is just a
backplate but yeah well that's pretty
impressive that did pretty much sit
against you case that backplate anyway
and it looks like the IO shield is
pre-installed and can't be removed which
is kind of cool you can't lose then you
can't forget to install it nothing worse
than getting everything installed and
then realizing you haven't done that
enough to take everything back out so
gigabyte have saved you from that pain
and embarrassment so the inside looks
like a similar package we won't go
through a lot over again and you guys
have probably seen reviews on the x-29
gaming nine and again I'm not exactly
sure what I'll do with this board
probably some sort of build or something
we'll definitely feature it yet on the
channel because it is a very very cool
looking board again you get those MDOT
two ports with the heat spreaders plenty
of power input pair of eight pins so you
should be able to run some fairly high
and start like X CPUs on this and have a
relatively good overclocking success
providing you have ample cooling be a
very cool board so that's going to wrap
up the unboxing boxes portion of
unboxing boxes big thanks to Levi for
sending this in
love the card I'll be as quick as I can
checking it out and then I'll pass that
on to you this week so you can get it in
base excited as I was to install at your
system and check it all out yeah very
nice car - congratulations on that
purchase I'm pretty sure you're going to
love it
now then we've got some cool gigabyte
motherboards
the X 399 board's variable can't wait to
check that out very keen to build my new
personal editing rig with the MSI extra
night onboard that'll be good hopefully
probably be two weeks before I'll get to
that because I just have a lot on at the
moment which I'll probably discuss in a
moment my new keyboard I'm definitely
using that one because I that looks
great all you guys know how it goes um
and yeah I think that's I'm we've got
the just another 1080 TOI from gala so
whatever
yeah so and I'll put this somewhere safe
and I'll knock that off so a short story
on my RX Vega sample which will probably
end up being a long story because
whenever I say something short I just
ramble on none of this is stricted none
of this is official information I think
this is me telling you guys a story
better behind the scenes stuff on what's
happening with my Vega our example so as
many of you know our X of a is being
released on Monday it'll be 11 p.m. my
time so Monday night and I was working
on thread Ripper all last week in unity
knowing aware that Vega rx was incoming
so I was like yeah as soon as I get this
thread Ripper stuff done which was as
you guys saw a heap of testing I'm gonna
have to shift gears into Vega Rx and I
want to do over 20 games for my day 1
review and I have updated all the
GeForce 10 Series stuff I've added the
rx 580 the fury X so all those figures
and all those numbers were updated I
started on Thursday so the second thread
Ripper was done uploaded I changed you
straight to retesting all the graphics
cards and like I said 20 games three
resolutions tourney P 1440p 4k I started
getting a lot done and yeah so I knew
Vega rx was incoming so I emailed AMD on
Monday what's to go one of the samples
arriving it's going to be a tight
turnaround it looks like and they said
you'll have it Wednesday some great I'll
get it Wednesday that means I'll have
possibly some time on Wednesday or
Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday and then
Monday I can get the review the video
done so that's a bit of time there
anyway get to Wednesday no sample ok
what's going on here email AMD we're
having some problems with the shipment
it's been delayed yet we'll let you know
heard nothing Thursday my AMD contact
gareth who really does look after as
well in australia he he said he sent me
an email saying but i've got to bring
you this afternoon
having major dramas okay so he rings me
up Thursday asked in explains that the
shipments been delayed they have no
control over it
so yeah that sucks who said so we've
formulated a back-up plan so the Vegas
64 cards or what was coming in the
shipment for the Ozzy reviewers so
myself and others and that's nothing by
missing which has been heavily delayed
they're expecting it maybe Friday if
they're lucky but probably Monday which
means you know I'm not going to get it
till Wednesday which is days after the
release so we miss out and that sucks
because you guys are no doubt waiting
for me to do it but testing which I want
to do so they said yeah we've we've
formulated a back-up plan we're now
having an a.m. the employee flight out
of the us with some Vega 56 cards in
their luggage bring it to Sydney I'm in
Victoria then my contact Gareth is going
to grab one of the cards jump on a plane
fly to Melbourne on Sunday morning which
is now I'll explain that a bit more a
second pass the card off to me or
someone and then get it to me hopefully
someday I can start testing
I pretty much won't sleep Sunday night
get all the testing done hopefully then
Monday appear on camera for you guys
looking completely wrecked as I often do
and put together a video hopefully get
that out by 11 p.m. tomorrow night so
that's that's the plan its I live two
hours from the airport and the Melbourne
Airport so it's not really just a hop in
the car go get it sort of thing it's
four hours out of my day and I still
have a bit of testing to do and I wanted
to do this unboxing boxes episode
because I just want a heap of stuff
backing up and it's getting worse by the
day
so my dad came to the rescue and he said
look I'll head out to the airport for
you I'll meet Gareth get the card off
him and bring it back to you so big
thanks to my dad what a legend saving me
big-time there it's a for hours right
now is a huge time saving because every
hour counts so I'm hoping to have Eric
Baker in hand in the next hour or two
and my dad gets you and then I'll get
testing you guys will be watching this
video by later on this afternoon once
it's edited and whatnot so hopefully
I'll be flat out into the testing
we won't have much time to reply to
comments but I'll always be checking
yeah hopefully hopefully I can get all
the testing done like I said pull an
all-nighter get it all done
hopefully not make any silly mistakes
and get you guys a video tomorrow night
but like I said yeah I'm testing over 20
games so I've never ever attempted to do
it and that sort of timeframe for video
so we'll see how we go if not it'll
probably be Tuesday night but I'll get
it up but anyway so that's where I'm at
good times lots of fun and yes so Vega
56 I believe is what I'll be bringing
you guys invader 64 will come later on
in the week when I recover so that's
that so I better get on out of here go
get editing and hopefully yeah get
started on some Vega RX testing or RX
Vega you know what I mean
all right guys thanks for watching if
you watch this far
appreciate you and I'll see you again
real soon
