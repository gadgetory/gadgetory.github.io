where once again focusing on AMD's new
desktop Raven Ridge ap use at this point
I'm sure you know just about everything
there is to know about these new Vega
infused CPUs that said though if you're
planning on buying the cheapest month
the seriously good value Verizon 320 200
G and you want to save every last dollar
possible you're probably asking yourself
the question a 320 or B 350 since
raisins release budget builders have had
the choice between one of two chipsets
the lockdown a 320 with no overclocking
support or the B 350 that gives users
the freedom to overclock their rise and
processes to 4 gigahertz and we're not
beyond just 2 4 gigahertz
I've always recommended that viewers shy
away from the a320 models they allow for
a 10 to 20 dollar seven but it's my
opinion that the trade-offs just really
aren't worth it that said if you never
intend to overclock resale value isn't
something you care about and the
complete lack of flexibility when it
comes to memory upgrades won't bother
you then getting a $50 a 320 board might
make sense for ten dollars more though
you gain the ability to overclock and
with the Raven Ridge APU that means CPU
and GPU overclocking neither of which is
possible on the a320 boards so just to
reiterate because I have seen a bit of
confusion around this you cannot and I
repeat cannot overclock the Vega GPU in
the Raven Ridge ap use on an a320
motherboard then if you're willing to
spend an additional twenty dollars over
a basic a320 board so $70 in total on
the motherboard that'll give you the
pick of some great overclockers then a
well stocked with plenty of nice
features and you also get four dimm
slots for flexible memory upgrades in
the future my personal budget-friendly
favorites include the asrock a be 350
pro 4 and msi be 350 PC mate now if
you're just upgrading an old system
you'll be in need of the Rison 320 200 G
obviously an AM for motherboard and at
least a gigabytes of ddr4 memory the
2200 G will set you back $100 a
dual-channel
8 gigabyte ddr4 3000 kit
also costs about $100 and then you need
a motherboard what I'm getting out here
is the total package with an a320 board
starts at about 250 dollars u.s. or
alternatively you're faced with a 270
dollar US bill with a decent be 350
board and that's sailing an 8% increase
for the upgrade so what do you get for
that extra investment overclocking aside
for just a moment you do get quite a few
extras for that small investment for
example the audio implementation is much
better on the asrock a be 350 pro 4
opposed to the asrock a 320 m you get
two extra SATA ports an extra em 2 port
many more PCIe slots a decent fee RM
with passive cooling more USB 3.0 ports
plus you also get a USB gen one type C
port and well it's a similar story with
other be 350 motherboards such as the
MSI be 350 PC mate for example what's
interesting is while asrock lists the
a320 m is having support for ddr4 3200
memory via overclocking i wasn't
actually able to get either of my Raven
Ridge apos working at this speed on the
a320 board in fact 3066 failed and I
even ran into a few stability issues of
the 29:33 forcing me down 2666 and here
thankfully the system was actually
stable so I went and got my hands on the
most expensive asrock a320 board the
a320 M pro 4 and at $65 it makes little
sense but I wanted to see if the memory
support was any better again I was
unable to post with these 3200 extreme
memory profile enabled and this time I
was forced to run at 29 33 which did
appear to be stable I should note that
increase in the DRAM voltage on either
board didn't seem to help now I'm not
saying all a320 motherboards won't work
above the spec for the memory but I
tried two different boards and neither
worked
I suspect the same might be true for the
ultra cheap $60 be 350 boards that share
the same physical design as the budget
a320 models however as I said earlier if
you spend a little more on models such
as the asrock a be 350 pro for these
memory compatibility issues seem to go
away and on this particular board I
wasn't able to run at ddr4 36
66 without any issues although rosin
CPUs are sensitive to memory frequency
normally I'd say for budget buyers this
really isn't a big deal however with the
Raven Ridge ap use it really is a big
deal
dropping down from ddr4 3200 to the 2933
will reduce frame rates by 6 percent and
going from 3200 to 2666 is about a 12%
reduction so while the a320 board might
offer a 7 percent saving overall here it
was at least 6 percent slower and that
alone really cancels out any savings
then of course there is the issue of
overclocking and I'd encourage all Raven
Ridge owners to give it a go the riser
master software makes overclocking
within Windows quite easy though I would
still suggest applying these settings in
the BIOS if you can in any case taking
the Vega at GPU embedded in the rise and
322 energy from its default operating
frequency of one point one gigahertz to
1.5 gigahertz is really easy and this 36
percent bump in frequency will net you
some really nice gains if you missed my
2200 year overclocking guide where I
showed you how to extract around 20%
more frames in games with a basic air
cooler then be sure to check that out
again I would just like to remind
viewers that it's not possible to
overclock either the CPU or the GPU on
the a320 boards so the Vega 8 GPU will
stay fixed at one point one gigahertz
under load by my own estimates your
standard quite easily extract 50% more
performance out of the 2200 G for gaming
when paired with a be 350 board using
ddr4 3200 memory so to me that alone
seems well worth investing 8% more in
the upgrade package so in a nutshell I'd
certainly invest that little extra
because you get a much better product
and just a much better overall result
with greater flexibility and more
options in the future it also might not
seem like a big deal right now but in a
few years time I believe the be 350
boards will be much more sought-after
on the second-hand market and therefore
they will command a higher asking price
so budget shoppers would be wise to keep
that in mind finally I'd also go as far
to say that gamers pairing a Raven Ridge
AP with an a320 board have really found
the perfect way to spoil the potential
of a great value product
