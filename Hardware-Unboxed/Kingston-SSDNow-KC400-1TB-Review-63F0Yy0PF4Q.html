thermal output and low power consumption
SSDs are becoming the norm in today's
data centers and heavy computing
environments the zero millisecond access
time performance of SSDs assume then
transform consumer PCs and they've been
doing the same for businesses we're
blazing fast access speeds are just as
important as a reliability and advanced
data protection virtually all the
big-name SSD makers have been targeting
both the consumer and business /
enterprise markets for years now
kingston has been offering enterprise
class SSD solutions and today they're
looking to expand their current lineup
with the KC 400 series built around the
files in PS 31 10 s10 controller the KC
400 series features enhanced data
protection which can prevent data loss
even if the entire system loses power
the a channel fires and controller
boasts a quad-core processor for a
sequential throughput at 550 megabytes
per second read and 530 megabytes per
second write on the largest 1 terabyte
model coupled with a random 4k read and
write input/output operations per second
of over 80,000 Kingston says the KC 400
is around 15 times faster than a
traditional hard drive and is capable of
delivering consistent performance for
both compressible and incompressible
data the KC 400 series provides
end-to-end data path protection and
smart a CCD guard data plus smart
refresh to protect against read errors
data is rebuilt if there's an error the
drive is able to recover from an
unexpected power shutdown by a firmware
controller power loss management the
drives are available in 128 gigabytes
256 gigabyte 512 gigabytes and one
terabyte capacities all featuring a mean
time between failure rate of 1 million
hours so your business should be pretty
well covered particularly given the KC
400 SSDs backed by limited five-year
warranty what this means is the one
terabyte model I have on hand is good
for a total of 1600 terabytes of written
data before it's expected to fight the
bullet that's a massive 89 gigabytes per
day of written data well that's enough
about the specs let's move on to see how
the KC 400 1 terabyte performs the read
and write access time
Kaycee 400 was extremely snappy beating
all the consumer-grade SSDs including
the samsung SSD 850 pro as expected the
KC 400 is able to max out the SATA
interface for measuring sequential
performance neither the read or write
tests the random 512 K write performance
of the KC 400 was very strong matching
some of the best results we've seen the
read performance in the other hand while
not weak was average at 391 megabytes
per second the random 4k performance was
on par with the Samsung SSD 850 Evo
which meant the KC 400 was relatively
strong here the KC 400 didn't set any
new speed records in the PC mark 7 video
editing tests with just 163 megabytes
per second but this is still a
respectable score and significantly
faster than a mechanical drive again we
find that the KC 400 provided below
average performance this time in the PC
mark 7 gaming benchmark still 110
megabytes per second didn't make it a
great deal slower than the crucial bf
200 + MX 200 SSDs finally we find that
the PC mark 8 storage bandwidth result
is again quite average a throughput of
237 megabytes per second places the KC
400 between the crucial BX 200 and the
samsung SSD 850 probe performance wise
the Kingston KC 400 1 terabyte delivered
essentially what we're expecting from an
SSD touted as a high performance
business solution for an SSD that places
such an emphasis on reliability and data
integrity the performance is still
impressive given that the key selling
point to the KC 400 series of the
claimed reliability and advanced data
protection attributes it's difficult for
us to test these clans within a week of
testing that forces me to fall back on
pricing information to make any kind of
meaningful breakdown
oddly as I'm putting this video together
the KC 400 series has been announced but
not officially released or at least
that's what's meant to be the case and
it's the reason why you haven't seen any
reviews until now yes as of mid Feb it's
been possible to purchase the KC 400
from a number of online retailers in the
US 1 terabyte model is available for a
staggeringly low 370 US dollars which
works out to 37 cents per gigabyte the
KC 310 960 currently costs four hundred
and thirty dollars while competing
drives such as the micron m5 10dc 960
gigabyte plus $500
the Samsung PM 863 960p you buy even
more $530 it really makes the KC 400 and
unbelievably good buy I'm keen to see
your pricing is adjusted once it's the
major online retailers such as
newegg.com
I'm not expecting it to change too much
at this point I can't confirm Ozzy
prices either thanks for checking out
the KC 400 one terabyte with me
is it a portable drive you'll be
considering let me know when I form a
hardware box comm or in the comments
I'm your host Matt and I'll see you guys
