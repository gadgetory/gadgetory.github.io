discussing what I feel were the worst
CPU and GPU purchases of 2017 now some
of these were just bad from the get-go
while others started life as viable
options that sadly proved poor choices
before year's end so let's get into it
kick starting 2017 Intel released the
new KB Lake series which actually didn't
turn to be all that new at all apart
from a small factory overclock these
were basically skylight parts and when
matched clock for clock we found zero
IPC gains so a few owned 2015 6700 K
there really was no need to buy the 7700
K which was a shame because the same
could be said if you owned either a
Haswell or Broadwell core i7 cpu and
arguably the same could also be said if
you add a Sandy Bridge or Ivy Bridge
core i7 still if you're coming from an
AMD FX series CP or maybe a core i5
something along those lines then the 77
Eriko offered noteworthy gains for those
rocking a higher-end graphics card and
that was therefore quite a viable option
unfortunately those have invested 340
dollars u.s. and a 77 RK ended up
getting completely hosed by Intel is
really no other way to put it less than
nine months later for almost the same
price Intel released the 8700 K which is
essentially the same CPU but with 50%
more cores and threads the 77 ok is
still a very capable gaming CPU but the
8700 K will no doubt prove to be a
significantly better investment down the
track I should also note that while I am
focusing all my attention on the 7700 K
the same can really be said for all the
cable a core i7 Core i5 and core i3 CPUs
they've all been heavily upgraded with
the arrival of coffee like their only
CPU that still remains a worthy
investment is the G 45 60 and there
really is nothing better for $100 even
today that said though I would probably
recommend you guys go and stretch that
budget a little bit for the core i3 81
that would be a much smarter choice now
anyway if you bought a 7700 K in the
first quarter of 2017 you're probably
not too upset that said there are those
seeking the ultimate gaming CPU midway
through the year and ended up pulling
the trigger on Intel's quad-core CPU
yeah those people will be quite livid
not only is the 7700 k's resale value
completely plummeted after the release
of the 87 okay but you can't even
upgrade to the 87 okay from the 77 okay
without a motherboard change and while
that brings me to part two of the intel
roll job this really is a continuation
of the kb lake cpus but it has to be
said compounding the issue as intel's
crazy decision to remove backwards
compatibility for new coffee-like cpus
despite using the same LGA 1151 socket
intel's decided that the configuration
needs to be changed and therefore 8th
gen cpus won't work with 100 or 200
series motherboards while skylake and
cable lake cpus also won't work on you
300 series boards whether or not it was
absolutely necessary for intel to
eliminate compatibility here I honestly
don't know I can just tell you that from
a consumers point of view is a massive
inconvenience if I had to guess I'd say
there's really no legitimate reason why
Intel's had to drop or has dropped
support for the 200 series motherboards
I said this even before reviewing the
coffee-like CPUs and quite a few Intel
fans did shoot me down on that one
however not that long ago bit tech
interviewed the product manager for ROG
motherboards out of seuss that's Andrew
Wu and he said a few interesting things
when asked if Intel let them could they
make it said 270 motherboards compatible
with 8 gen core processors Andrew said
yes it would require a BIOS update but
Intel somehow locked compatibility in
the end this means those who invested in
a 200 series motherboard this year and
now at the end of the road those core i7
77 ok owners are now faced with having a
ditch not just their CPU but also their
shiny new said 270 motherboard if
want to upgrade to a six core CPU truth
be told right now the move from the 77
error cage of the 87 okay isn't worth
the investment even if it was supported
or or possible on the same platform that
said the option to make this upgrade in
a year or so time well that would
probably be very welcomed by Intel
customers anyone who spent $200 plus on
his head 270 motherboard will surely be
upset with Intel's decision here moving
on if you're a core i7 77 ok owner and
you feel robbed well then can we please
have a moment's silence for anyone who
bought a core i7 7800 X with Rison
already out and about before the arrival
of the Scylla hex range there seemed to
be little point in buying the core i7 78
20 X and in particular the six core 7800
X processor nanano dollars USD 70 her ex
was a step up from the Seven Samurai
okay for productivity workloads no doubt
about that it was a bit of a step back
for gaming but it's more of a
Productivity platform so that wasn't a
big issue but it was very poor value and
positioned next to the Rison 7 1700
still those that bought in the last 4
months well they knew what they were
getting and the newly alternatives were
and they purchased anyway what they
didn't know though was that the 8700 K
would come along for basically the same
price and offers the same amount of
cores and threads while supporting much
higher operating frequencies and more
level 3 cache along with what is in my
opinion a superior method of connecting
10 or less cores and that is of course
to use the ring bus 3,700 K is also
supported by significantly cheaper
motherboards at the cheaper Zed 370
board for example is about half the
price of the cheapest X 299 board in
fact the only real advantage of the 70
100x would be those extra PCIe lanes but
if you want PCIe lanes I'd probably just
skip sky like X altogether and get
yourself a thread Ripper CPU oh and it
also has quad channel memory let's not
forget about that but based on my own
practically benchmarks yeah the 8700 K
schools to 1700 K out of the box and
what overclocked
so that extra memory bandwidth isn't
coming in handy
I suppose they're only saving grace for
the 700x
is the upgrade path I suppose if you
saved $10 each week and just under four
years you'd be able to get yourself an
18 course 79 80 XC maybe three years of
the second-hand markets kind now for the
GPUs last year was a mega year for GPU
releases the GeForce 10 series was
mighty impressive in terms of
performance per watt and AMD at least
made the mid-range stuff for the
mid-range to low-end segments
interesting let's say 2017 has been more
of a mixed bag I think it's fair to say
that the GTX 1080 TI was an exciting
product a very impressive launch and
many appreciated the fact that it did
knock the GTX 1080 down to $500 u.s.
from AMD though I think it's fair to say
that the Radeon refresh was a pretty
affair I did bring more competitive
pricing at least initially very
initially our Vega was pretty much
another shoulder shrug from AMD though
Vega 56 looks somewhat promising
the recent Vega performance in new
titles has been decent the big problem
for AMD and even Nvidia to a certain
degree has been pricing and availability
thanks to an extreme demand from
cryptocurrency miners which has kept up
now for about five months so if you
bought a Radeon graphics card in the
last few months chances are you paid too
much heavily overpaid in fact and some
will no doubt have been caught out by
these price hikes despite offering a
strong bang for your buck at the MSRP
aim DS Radeon GPUs have turned out to be
one of the worst buyers of 2017 for PC
gamers that's pretty much for the simple
fact that you can't buy them anywhere
near the MSRP and even buying one at an
inflated price has been quite
challenging that said though I was
almost going to pull this little segment
from this video because as I was putting
it together I did notice that Vega 56 is
starting to sell at the MSRP it was
previously $500 or more and I am seeing
quite a few examples now selling for
$400 us and availability seems to be
improving or at least matching demand
and so prices are starting to normalize
so yeah I mean it doesn't change the
fact that for quite a few months there
you were getting steamrolled if you buy
port an AMD card so I guess it's still
valid to a certain degree the next AMD
item on the list of those X rated CPUs
like Intel's too hot for TV range most
of the X models don't really make a
whole lot of sense that said though I
shouldn't note as was the case with the
GPUs and when I initially put this video
together the horizon 7 1800 X was
selling for $450 and the 1700 X was
selling for $360 and in the u.s. at
least they are now on sale for much more
affordable prices so it does make them a
little less ridiculous but anyway in my
opinion the risin 7 18 hundred x is
still the biggest waste of money
AMD set the MSRP at $500 u.s. which
makes no sense at all today it can be
found though selling for as little as
$400 at least went on sale the 1700 X
which is essentially the same CPU anyway
can be had for $300 right now so again
they're still even with the sale prices
no point paying $100 more for 1900 x1
you can get the same CPU for $100 less
and then it is kind of hard to say well
there's by these 1700 X because it is
only slightly more than the 1700 but the
1700 you get a box cooler so you're
getting a box cooler included and you're
getting to keep 15 dollars of your own
money so so yeah I can't really think of
any real genuine reason why someone
would spend more money on these X chips
even if they were bend but they still
don't guarantee a 4 gigahertz overclock
and I've tested quite a few retail 1800
X chips now and for 1700 chips and I've
felt all of them hit 4 gigahertz and
they did work with ddr4 3200 memory of
course though overclocking rise in CPU
to 4 gigahertz is far from guaranteed as
I said but I've found that you have just
as much luck with the cheap
bargain-basement models as you do the
expensive X models so I guess that's the
point I'm trying to make their Aizen 5
1600 isn't as bad in my opinion only
costs a little over 10% more than the
non X version
but again you're paying 10% more for the
same CPU while foregoing the included
cooler and again I'm not sure why you
would do that the 1500 X in my opinion
is also a bit pointless because it's
priced so close to the r5 1600 and
that's a much better CPU the 1600 offers
50% more cores for a mere 13% increase I
think it is in price the extra l3 cache
of the fifth and Reks over the 1400
really is little advantage as well with
even a mid-range to high-end graphics
card you'll see no real gains in games
when they're clocked at the same
frequency
finally the risin thread repair 1900 s
is more of a niche product it's not
completely useless but if you're going
to jump on the extra nine platform just
cough up the extra dough for the 1950 X
it's a serious bargain now as well eight
hundred and eighty dollars u.s. in some
way I wouldn't say that the X models are
absolutely terrible buyers or anything
like they just don't really make that
much sense certainly not like what we
saw with the 77 or okay we're you know
within the same year that products kind
of dead so we haven't seen that with
Verizon but still I mean spending the
kind of money you go from the 1700 to
the 1800 X is a bit crazy when you're
not actually really securing anything
extra
now if I made this a yearly feature
invidious titan product line would no
doubt make they cut each and every year
late last year we got the mighty tight
necks and I'm of course talking about
the Pascal version not the or not to be
confused with the Maxwell tight necks
from 2015
anyway the Pascal tight necks arrived
late last year and it was the biggest
baddest GPU Nvidia Helen offer of course
as always those that bought into the
Titan con got completely hosed just
three months into 2017 and the gtx 980ti
arrived sure it had one gigabyte shaved
off the 12 gigabyte memory buffer but
with higher core and memory clock speeds
it was a faster product but today DCI
also benefited from vastly superior
adding board partner coolers making it
much faster once overclocked allowing
all 3584 cuda cores to work much more
efficiently
despite the gtx 980ti quickly putting
down the Titan X Nvidia came back for
round 2 and released the Titan XP
branded with the same insane $1200 us
asking price means that it's over 70%
more expensive than existing ttio models
so what do you get for all that extra
mauler a 7% increase in CUDA cores and a
teeny tiny increase in the vram capacity
once again the Titan XP can only be
purchased with the founders Asian cooler
and that is directly through in video so
as a result it runs hot and throttles
under heavy load so it's actually slower
than custom 1080 TI cards at this point
gamers with deep pockets really ought to
know better than to buy a Titan but I'm
sure there'll be those that still do
anyway just for the bragging rights
though it has to be set at this point
it's getting more embarrassing than
anything
speaking of embarrassing what about
those new Star Wars collector edition
models actually I do have to admit those
look pretty awesome still though imagine
if you were a huge Star Wars fan and you
could afford stupidly expensive hardware
and just a few weeks prior to the
announcement of this collector's edition
model you bought a Titan XP for $1,200
us
I wonder what's the return policy on
those Nvidia surely you'd be absolutely
spitting chips at the announcement of a
$1,200 collector's edition Star Wars
graphics card but you've just bought the
standard plain old Titan XP version
I suppose it's you guys are probably
sitting there going well it's hard to
have any sympathy for people who spend
12 and roll's on a Titan XP but yeah I
suppose that's the life of a Titan arena
you just know it's only a matter of
months probably a month or two before
you're gonna get completely hosed but I
guess the fun part is finding out how so
2017 has been an exciting but also
frustrating year for PC hardware and
although a few early adopters and those
seeking bragging rights got a little bit
there's been some great value options as
well has to be said though Intel
probably pounded consumers the hardest
and much of that pounding could have
been avoided if they just kept
compatibility for their 8th gen Core
series with the previous 7th and 6th gen
series anyway that's going to do it for
this one let me know if I missed any
products or if you disagree with any of
my choices or perhaps just have a bit of
a different take on things I'm your host
