today is GPU related video is going to
be a bit different from our recent AMD
vs in video comparisons instead of
picking a pair of graphics cards
targeting a certain price range will be
comparing AMD's radiant 300 series to
determine which office game is the most
bang for their buck at the highly
popular 1080p resolution this means will
be heavily focused on price versus
performance as always i'll be using
newegg.com as my baseline for pricing
and therefore all prices will be based
on the US currency ideally we'll be
looking for an average of 60 frames per
second though we understand some gamers
one upwards of 120 frames per second for
their 120 her to 144 hurts gammy
monitors the testing was selected five
relatively new games a one upcoming game
battlefield 4 the witcher 3 wild hunt
watchdogs the Dragon Age Inquisition and
the early access title is ashes of the
singularity which has been tested using
DirectX 12 fractures used to measure
framerate performance and we record a 90
seconds of game play in each game that's
there please no ashes of the singularity
was tested using the built-in bench mark
as fraps doesn't work yet under DirectX
12 also to be absolutely clear the
gameplay wasn't recorded using fraps
just the frame rate there was no impact
on the game performance so is this
flaming in the comment section if you
can additionally all graphics cards use
were clocked according to the default
AMD specifications an overclocking
performance won't be taken into account
here testing takes place exclusively at
1080p using a core i5 6600 k processor
with the latest graphics card and system
drivers under Windows 10 first up in our
benchmarks we have ashes of the
singularity which as I mentioned isn't
actually released yet though the early
access build is quite stable in AMD is
already delivering some very solid
DirectX 12 performance since DirectX 12
doesn't rely on the display driver for
performance optimizations like directx11
dad's things shouldn't change too much
anyway since this is one of the first
DirectX 12 games
become available through early access
and it features a great built-in
benchmark we decided to include it as
you can see this highly demanding video
game calls for quite a bit of GPU power
even at 1080p the radeon r9 380 was
overwhelmed with an average of just 26
frames per second that said the 390 did
a lot better producing 41 frames per
second making it just three frames per
second slower than the 390 X and not a
great deal slower than the 53 frames per
second of the fury X cost wise the 390
makes the most sense here is it was the
first GPU to live a smooth gameplay
though the 380 does quite well at almost
seven dollar 70 per frame the 39 th
costs a little over nine dollars 50 per
frame which isn't good value at all and
the fury is even worse in almost ten
dollars ad and let's not talk about the
fury ax battlefield 4 was tested using
the maximum in-game quality settings
along with two times MSAA the i7 360s
struggle with just 33 fans per second
while the r7 370 provided a much better
experience with 46 frames per second for
around 60 frames per second diono 380 is
required punching well past the 60
frames per second barrier was the i9 390
with 80 frames per second and we find
that the 390 x is a much faster with an
average of just 84 frames per second
moving to the iron own nano provided
another boost in performance as we hit
98 frames per second the standard fury
proved to be very fast with a hundred
frames per second while the fury axles
good for 108 frames per second now let's
look at how much each frame is costing
you for each card the 650 dollar fury ax
came in across the six dollars per frame
while the fury was considerably better
value at five dollars fifty per frame as
expected the i9 nano represents the
worst value of the current AMD lineup as
it's a niche gaming products designed
for ultra compact gaming machines the r9
390 X looks to be rather good value at
five dollars per frame when compared to
even the iron I'm fury but it isn't
until we filtered down to the I know 390
the five dollar seems like a rough deal
this because the I know 390 comes at a
cost of three dollar 75 per frame making
it 25 percent better value than the r9
390 and a little over thirty percent
better value
in the iron I'm fury.the I know 380 was
better value again and we found that the
r9 380 r7 370 and 09 360 all delivered a
similar price per frame that said the r7
360 was too slow at 1080p used in the
maximum quality settings and the same
really applies to the r7 370 as well
dragon age inquisition played
surprisingly well on the r7 360
considering the quality settings
disabling anti-aliasing would probably
be enough for smooth game players that
managed 31 frames per second with two
times MSAA enabled the r7 370 was
slightly faster with 38 frames per
second while the iron 380 was
considerably faster averaging 55 frames
per second moving to the r9 390 we see
another huge jump in performance with an
average of 80 frames per second while
the 390 X wasn't a great deal faster
averaging 80 4 frames per second the
Nano was good for 92 frames per second
while the fury pressed on 494 frames per
second as expected the fury axe provided
the best performance averaging 97 frames
per second the price per frame in Dragon
Age Inquisition is quite similar to what
we saw in battlefield 4 again the 393
8370 and 360 all delivered similar bang
for your buck is the cost per frame
range between three dollars fifty and
four dollars the 390 x then jumped up to
five dollars while the fury cost five
dollars 85 the fury axe didn't represent
great value to cost of six dollar 70 per
frame while the nano was even worse at
seven dollars per frame as was the case
with the previously tested games the 360
is only good for around 30 frames per
second when using the maximum in-game
quality settings meanwhile the 370 isn't
a great deal faster with 39 frames per
second performance becomes acceptable
with the 380 which averaged 54 frames
per second while the 390 blows the gap
wide open with 75 frames per second
after the 392 gains are again quite
minimal as we end up with 93 frames per
second with the fury axe the cost per
frame between the 360 370 380 and 39 is
extremely close in thief which is 37
separating the cheapest and most
expensive options the 390 X cost dollar
25 more per frame than the 390
and things only get worse as we climb
the AMD food chain the fury ax average
is silky smooth 98 frames per second and
watch dogs while the standard fury was
good for 95 frames per second the nano
average 92 frames per second followed by
the 390 X with 86 frames per second once
again the 390 was within striking range
of the 390 acts as an average 80 friends
per second from there we drop all the
way down to 56 frames per second with
the 380 and then down to 41 frames per
second with the 370 the 360 was unable
to handle the maximum in-game quality
settings as average just 26 frames per
second the 360 sluggish performance in
watch dogs heard its price for frame
rating making it only slightly better
than the 390 X again the 380 delivered
the most bang for your buck though it
was closely followed by the 370 and 390
the witcher 3 wild hunt was tested with
all the eye candy turned on which
included hair works which runs very well
an AMD hardware now thanks to a number
of game optimizations over the past few
months even so the 360 was written off
is just 21 frames per second and the 370
wasn't much better as it averaged just
29 frames per second even the 380s
struggled here though it was technically
playable at 37 pounds per second that
said the 390 delivered a noticeably
better experience with 54 frames per
second while the fury axe wasn't a great
deal faster with 68 frames per second
here we see that 360 370 380 and 390 all
came at a similar cost per frame at
around five dollars to five dollars 50
the Nano doubled that figure is a blue
out of ten dollars per frame and the
fury x wasn't much better at nine
dollars 55 per frame measuring the cost
per frame isn't something I've done
before but I found it be very
interesting and I hope you guys did as
well obviously this data is highly
dependent on the price we set for each
graphics card and that being the case we
went with what we believe to be the
typical asking price for each card and
excluded any sales or rebates although
we didn't test a huge range of games the
six games that we did test we've
provided fairly consistent results and
should paint an accurate picture the
card that delivered the best bang for
your buck was the radeon r9 380 overall
that came in to cost of three dollars 94
per frame assuming a purchase price of
two hundred dollars and with an average
of 52 frames per second it was just fast
enough
perfectly smooth gameplay at 1080p with
all the eye candy turned up the r7 370
was a close second at three dollars 97
per frame though it only averaged thirty
nine frames per second making it a bit
too slow for smooth 1080p gaming that
said if you only have around one hundred
fifty dollars to spend then it does
represent exceptional value just be
prepared to scale down some of the
quality settings the only other
worthwhile alternative is the Radeon r9
390 which provided a little over forty
percent more performance than the 380 on
average while costing just six percent
more per frame assuming a purchase price
of three hundred dollars the 390 costs
on average four dollars 16 per frame
which is remarkable value beyond that
things got out of control with the 390 X
costing almost five dollars fifty per
frame the fury around six dollars 30 per
frame and the fury x over seven dollars
per frame therefore we recommend the
Radeon r9 380 is the best value AMD
graphics Carver 1080p gaming note we
tested the two gigabyte model as we feel
it represents the best value especially
at 1080p but if you can get the four
gigabyte version for a similar price
then by all means do so just be careful
about paying a notable premium for a
larger memory buffer that you likely
won't use if you can foot the bill for
the 390 then we suggest you do it as it
works out to be roughly the same in
terms of value but you end up with a
better gaming experience finally for
those of you that want to study the
grass in a more practical format we've
uploaded them all to our forum hardware
on box calm so be sure to check that out
I'll provide a direct link in the video
