have a couple of boxes on hand I think
there's gonna be some pretty cool stuff
in these two boxes here we also of
course have the garbage bag that I
forgot to look at in the last episode
we'll finally get some closure you guys
will get to find out what's in the
garbage bag and this just arrived I
actually have no idea what is in it it
was in a little plastic bag which I've
taken it out of because I the shipping
label didn't say what it was so I was a
bit intrigued but I haven't opened it up
yet new package from Intel so a little
suspicious if there's anything that I
can't show you guys I'll have to blur it
out and we'll have to move on but I
don't think there is it was yeah a bit
of a weird one so we'll get is that
first we can safely assume that it is
from Intel unless it's someone just
using Intel packaging but we have that
and now a standard whitish looking box
take a break grab your cup and get ready
to see what Intel's been brewing more
8th gen Intel Core processor goodness
coming soon well certainly sounds very
nice so what have we got in here whoa
that's definitely coffee ok fuel up with
some robust and bold innovation alright
well that's gonna come in handy for all
the benchmarking I think I'm gonna have
to be doing over the next week or so
ok then we've got oh that's a bit
disappointing
that's my new Intel mug maybe we have to
piece it together maybe it's a build
build your own mug yeah this hasn't gone
well at all looks like it's in four
pieces
it looks like I've been sent a smashed
mug bust out a bit of Tarzan's grip and
I'll be able to fix that up no problems
looks better from that side there's a
bigger chip take it out this side it's
probably in the box somewhere okay so
that was an interesting little package
there from Intel we have some coffee
which I'll try that out before the end
of the episode we'll give the coffee a
go and see if it uh if it'll give me all
the energy I need to get through all the
benchmarking then we have a little
packet of chalk four sticks of chalk not
sure how that relates to the whole
coffee thing I assume this is something
to do with the code name being coffee
lake I don't know I don't really know
where the chalk falls into that but my
kids will be happy to have four new
sticks of chalk there's broke one of
them getting it open so everything's
broken now cool well I think we're just
going to move on from this pretty
quickly thanks for sending the mug Intel
I wish it had it got here in one piece
TNT might have been a bit rough on the
handling on that one I'm just gonna
hmm her coffee smells nice anyway all
right let's move this out of the way
we'll tackle this box here because I
think this is going to be one of the
highlights of today's episode so you
might as well after the disappointment
of that first package get into something
which should be guaranteed to be good
it says Zee 370 godlike gaming on both
sides of the box so if it's anything but
I'll probably be disappointed all right
let's get into this let's get going now
I know Intel had you on the edge of your
seat with that coffee gag but what have
we got here oh yeah okay MSI z3 70
gaming God like there's a bit of paper
in there with some media sample
qualification information but all right
let's get into it we'll get that out
levels the board well I definitely can't
read anything off of that because that
will definitely be in breach of NDA
can't talk about any pricing information
or any performance information and that
was covered in benchmark figures so what
we can talk about is this massive and
very awesome looking at 370 motherboard
MSI and fantex have got together to give
you an LED light strip with your
motherboard mmm this looks pretty cool
I'll get that in a second the i/o shield
looks a bit special it's got two
different themed covers red and black or
silver and black yeah silver and black
and red and black what else we got in
here
some braided SATA cables that's a bit
I've got a red and black braided pair of
braided start okay SATA cables as well
okay let's check this thing out Wow I'll
have to throw up some b-roll of this and
give you guys a good look out from all
angles cuz it's it's a bit special
looking is there anything on the back of
it no just a standard looking board on
the back oh there are a few heat
spreaders behind the erm I guess there'd
be the MOSFETs so that's cool talking in
the vrm this thing has a two-force
twelve looks like an eighteen phase vrm
holy moly I'll give you guys a good look
at that so I went and quickly did a bit
of research just then between that last
jump cut because I don't know anything
about this board really didn't exactly
know it was coming I wasn't expecting it
today anyway so on board we have three M
two slots and you can see two of them of
the 110 milling ones so full-length
slots but most of the devices used
probably only going to be 80 ml long but
anyway 3m doctors with shields and if
for some reason that isn't enough with
this godlike package you also get so
this PCI Express 3/8 x expansion card
will allow you to put two more M two
drives into your system with this
godlike board so that's five M 2 in
total you can see you've got the the
shields on this as well so yeah I
haven't tested how they work these days
for the MSI boards but anyway you can
opt not to use them if you don't want to
they're there anyway it looks really
cool so if you want to have just a
crap-ton of em not to storage this is
the board to do it with by the looks of
it so apart from the silly amount of em
to storage support and the crazy amount
of power phases what else do you get on
this board we actually get a silly
amount of Gigabit Ethernet as well their
heart one not two but three of the
killer a 2500 Gigabit LAN controllers
and they're also supported via the
killer network manager software so yeah
that is a lot of gigabit storage it
would've been cool to get something like
a 10 gigabit solution in there but
whatever the yeah I don't know then I
just say three that's a lot you also get
a killer Wi-Fi adapter on there for
Bluetooth and Wi-Fi that uses their AC
50 and 35 controller so yeah that's
pretty cool
apparently the Wi-Fi can also be used as
an access point or a range extender so
there's some pretty interesting features
there for this board yes are plenty of
features
is on board they're still doing it's
really interesting the way MSI has been
doing this I don't really know if I
approve or not I'll have to do some
thermal testing with this board but it's
a really really good-looking board it
looks cool but the problem I have is a
lot of this sort of stuff is all plastic
and so you've got to quite decent-sized
heat sinks over the vrm but they're
covered in plastic like they're like
insulated with plastic so yeah
interesting design choice that I'm not
sure how much that'll affect affect
thermal performance but we will look
into that and then it's time this is all
plastic around here this thankfully this
top that's aluminium so that'll be over
the Z 370 chipset and that is connected
to a aluminium heat sink so that should
work quite well but yeah a lot of this
is just plastic it's all just aesthetic
for look so all the i/o shield stuff
that's all plastic which is fine but
yeah over the heat sinks a bit of an odd
choice there to go with plastic but
anyway otherwise a really promising
board anyway hopefully you guys have had
a good look at it with the b-roll shots
that I've been able to provide I will be
using this board to do all my eighth
generation Intel testing so that it will
be you'll see that review on the 5th of
October so so along with the coffee that
Intel so graciously provided I'll have
to bring my own mug but not a problem I
will be using this MSI motherboard for
all my 8th generation intel core CPU
testing which you'll see on the channel
on the 5th of October can't talk about
like said price or performance but we
can show the boards and yeah that's what
I've done here so very cool board can't
wait to test it out and then show you
guys how it handles later in the well
early next month not later this month
early next month all right starting the
waffle a bit I'll move on get this last
one out of the way this last big box
then we'll move on to the three packages
to my left
ooh we have another Gooden here
hello Boris said through all Z 370 horas
Ultra gaming so basically a gigabyte
motherboard it was at 370 board I think
because they have actually announced all
their motherboards on the gigabyte
website so you can hop over there and
check them all out this board is there I
believe this is probably the second
highest tier board or there abouts think
the gaming 7 might actually be the top
tier board in the series can can't talk
about pricing I don't actually know
anyway so yeah I have no idea where this
would be priced so we'll just quickly
take a look at this one show it off to
you guys and I think special in the
package nope
just your standard SATA cables and stuff
so yeah that suggests to me I'll be
around the $200 mark us but I can't know
either and if I did know I couldn't say
so wow this is a pretty cool looking
board much lighter than the board we
just looked at from our MSI ok so I'm
not sure this could be a six phase vrm
on this one no 100% sure so don't quote
me on that but we have triple PCIe x 16
slots only the first one is wired for 16
16 x bandwidth the next one is 8 x and
the bottom one is 4 x then we've got
three one time slots six SATA ports your
4 dims so it's a good-looking board good
audio solution but it's also fairly
basic so nothing too over the top it'll
be yeah definitely
priced I'd say under $200 looking at
what's on the board but again time will
tell I have to say gigabyte makes some
other especially if you like fancy RGB
lighting and whatever they make some of
the best looking boards or possibly the
best-looking boards these days these are
two slots here RGB lit LED lit so are
the DIMM slots there's a strip along the
side here that is as well looks like the
i/o
cover is as well so yeah gigabyte
haven't covered the
vrm heat sinks in plastic so that's
probably a good choice I'd imagine now
but anyway we'll check that out as well
nothing on the back and it looks like a
pair of m2 slots so yeah good looking
board cool little heat sink here
hopefully I've thrown up a bit of b-roll
for you guys so you're getting a really
good look at it one little point of
controversy within your 8th gen series I
don't know how much you guys have looked
into them yet but although they use the
socket 1150 one which is the same as
what we saw the sky like and cabe you
like you cannot use sky sky Lake or cabe
you like CPUs on these boards and more
importantly which is probably upsetting
people the most is that you can't buy an
eighth generation CPU and use it on your
sixth or seventh generation boards which
would be the 100 series or 200 series
chipset boards so that's pretty
disappointing um as far as I know
there's no real reason that Intel
couldn't having done you know included
our backwards compatibility there
they're just trying to sell more
motherboards and chipsets well chipsets
really but anyway so that's a bit
disappointing that yeah if you bought a
Zed 170 board a real high-end one for
like four or five hundred dollars that
you're gonna have to ditch that now if
you want to get a new core i7 processor
or Core i5 or whatever you may want to
get I assume the socket is exactly the
same I don't believe I am
breaching any terms and conditions by
doing this I can't imagine why but and
that fits into the socket perfectly
probably expect it at would so they do
physically fit in it all the locators
are exactly the same position and
everything so it fits in the socket no
worries it'll just be a yeah a BIOS
microcode thing where it just probably
won't post I have no idea it shouldn't
because yeah until I've said that
they're not going to support them anyway
I'll look into that and we'll see anyway
moving on I'm trying not to I'll try to
breeze through this quicker than I
normally do I've got a bit of a
toothache I had a wisdom tooth removed a
few days ago so it's still very
comfortable oh that was that was a bad
choice yep to vacuum that up later did
that the wrong way okay what do we have
here
I'm not sure if I'm allowed to show you
those yet so I won't add the risk that
I'm not
they have been announced and whatnot but
we'll leave them alone for now because I
don't know and what is this an Intel
obtained memory m'd up to 32 gigabyte
won't worry about that all right yep
we'll keep moving right along getting
through this cuz I know you guys who are
fans of the series want to know what's
in here and soda lies Oh having felt it
now I've got a pretty good idea won't
waste any time I'll get straight into it
so this is another pipe from bang good
are you Chinese retailer and what if
they sent me a mousepad who would have
guessed
oh it's quite a nice mousepad there you
go a black and sort of grayish whitish
mousepad with the world map on it that's
pretty cool I better find some details
out about it for you okay so on the
Bangla website this is called the
large-sized world map and it is 900
millimeters long by 400 millimeters deep
and it is just 2 millimeters thick so it
is very thin but I also like that it's
actually not that thick because it the
transition from the desk to the pad
isn't that extreme I suppose and it also
means that it's not extremely expensive
it's only $12 u.s. for this mouse pad or
$15 Aussie so yeah for a huge mousepad
this when it feels I mean it's got
stitched edging which
looks to be pretty good quality
stitching it feels good I am definitely
gonna replace my current mousepad with
this and give it a go and see how well
it lasts and how it wears and stuff like
that but I mean $15 e this is an awesome
mousepad in my opinion certainly it's
rubberized backing yeah it seems really
good pretty blown away by that well I
don't really have much else to say about
that but uh there's the rubber back on
it yeah that's if you're looking for a
great big Mouse pepper I don't want to
spend forty or fifty dollars or whatever
they're trying to charge for almost one
meter size my ass pads these days
I recommend grabbing one of these I'm
not exactly sure how much it is with
shipping I don't think it'd be terrible
terribly expensive but yeah $15 dollars
or $12 US for that mouse pad that is an
awesome value by I'll Chuck a link to
the banggood sale page in the
description below so if you guys want to
get one go for it but yeah my initial
impression I can't really think of
anything bad to say about it but I'll
give it a go alright wrapping your SEPA
sewed up hopefully it haven't been too
long we will check out what's in this
box
and that'll do us okay it looks like a
bluetooth speaker hello giant I think
that's the retailer sent it let's see so
it is the W King X 6 of course bluetooth
speaker let's check it out okay looks
and feels pretty good stay okay so in
the package you get a USB two micro USB
cable that will be to charge it doesn't
actually come with a charger so you'll
need to use your phone charger or
whatever but everyone these days has
about a dozen of those and a 3.5 mm
audio jack if you want to hook it up to
whatever device you're playing your
music from to the speaker without using
the bluetooth portion of the Bluetooth
speaker and it looks like you have a
neat little breathable carry case here
so easy it is to get into that
okay that was pretty easy even for me so
the owner you can carry it around it's
fairly well protected you can check that
in your bag or whatever so it's got like
a sort of steel mesh construction around
we believe would be the speaker part
it's a rubberized bottom and top so
it'll take a full pretty well I would
say and then you've got some controls on
the front here so volume up and down
play pause looks like the call button or
something like that five volt into
charge looks like we have the 3.5 mm
jack and then the power button there so
does it have any charge bluetooth mode
okay I've still got my Samsung phone the
Galaxy s8 I haven't got rid of that yet
so I'll use that for this test
let's go bluetooth scanning
okay has available devices x6 hitting
the pair button Harrod welcome to use
we'll play some laking and spy on it
yeah okay the audio quality isn't bad
I wouldn't rave about it the bass and
stuffs decent seems to have a lot of
background hissing when a playing of the
music so right now it's completely
silent if I play a song
did you guys hear that I don't know how
well that came through but yeah as the
musics playing it's got a really quite a
loud hissing to it so yeah on the plus
side it is only fifty dollars u.s. or I
think it's about sixty six Australian
dollars it works out to be if you buy it
through the I think to the alley giant
retailer so that's not too bad I mean
the speakers that we often look at like
the UE boom and stuff like that they're
like two hundred and two hundred and
fifty Australian so for the price it's
not bad so you depending on how picky
you are the sound quality's okay if
you're listening to it from a distance
or you've got in a room or whatever that
hissing sound probably won't be as
noticeable opposed to just holding in
your hand and sitting this far from the
sound source so yeah keep that in mind I
don't know how long the battery lasts
because obviously I just took out of the
box and I'm using whatever charge came
with it so that's another important
thing to consider I'll have to look into
that I don't know if they make any
claims on their website I did read some
Amazon reviews just briefly then it has
there's a hundred eight Amazon reviews
at the moment and eighty-eight percent
of them are five-star reviews so people
who have bought this for the $50 u.s. or
whatever are very happy with it there
were about five or six reviews from
people who had had it for a couple of
weeks now and they said it no longer
holds charge so once it go a few weeks
old it stops holding charge so I don't
know if that's going to happen or not
but I will give this a good work and
I'll use it quite regularly and we'll
see if it's still holding charge and a
few weeks on but I think value for money
it's probably assuming that it has a
reasonably decent run time
and it does hold its charge months down
the track and I think for $50 us it's
probably a pretty decent buy because
like I said I'm coming from
most of the Bluetooth speakers but I've
sort of gone around here hiding all over
the place they're $200 plus so 466 Ozzy
I'd say it's not too bad but if you guys
know of any really good value Bluetooth
speakers feel free to let me know about
them in the comments below and I'll try
and get my hands on them all right so I
think that's going to do it for this one
the painkillers are starting to wear off
and I can feel the giant hole in the
back of my mouth so on this episode we
get to check out the new msi godlike Z
370 the Auris gaming ultra that's a
slick looking Bordeaux pits as
affordable as I think it will be that
won't be as affordable actually that'll
yeah that'll just be expensive like I
think it'll be but it is a very cool
board really can attest that when I test
the CPUs that I think I have just here
hopefully and whilst you but the
Bluetooth speaker which we just looked
at I got my coffee over here and I'll
take care of in a moment and yeah oh we
got the mousepad mousepad I'll provide a
link for this thing in the video
description so anyway I hope you guys
enjoyed this episode I hope I performed
just as well as I normally do with
plenty of drugs in my system and I'll go
top-up on some coffee cheese yeah that's
holding on really well
see you next time guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
