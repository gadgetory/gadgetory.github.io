getting all giddy Verizon I know I was
grinning from ear to ear like a buffoon
rumors started to surface regarding a
counter from Intel
we knew that Rison was going to offer
six core and eight core CPUs for the
mainstream and it was unlikely that
Intel's existing quad cores would be
able to compete admittedly though the
7600 K and 7700 K do still quite mighty
at least for gaming but their time in
the Sun is no doubt limited
anyway the rumored processors were from
the KB Lake excellent up and they were
none too exciting the Core i5 or 7640 X
looked to be pretty much a renamed 7600
K while the core i7 7740 X was pretty
much a renamed 7700 K these new x-series
processes were a bit confusing it would
suggest that the 76 40 X could possibly
inherit hyper-threading support
essentially making it a core i7 and the
77 40 X could be upgraded with six cause
those upgrades didn't seem particularly
likely to me though but it also didn't
seem likely the Intel would simply just
released their existing mainstream CPUs
on their high-end desktop platform after
all what would that achieve and how does
it anyway be accounted arisin well
that's exactly what they've done
repackage the KB Lake 7600 K and 7700 K
as K be like X parts and call it a day
on paper you'll see that the KB like X
parts come with a very mild factory
overclock and Sport a higher TDP rating
as a result pricing remains the same
though overall cost is dramatically
increased thanks to the more expensive X
299 platform it's hard to imagine why
anyone would spend twice as much on the
next $2.99 board so these quad-core CPUs
when they could simply get all the same
features and capabilities in a z2 70
board for half the price not only that
but half the features don't actually
work on the external boards when using
KB like X CPUs as they lack the required
amount of PCI Express Lanes and only
support dual channel memory anyway all
this mess aside for now how does the
core i5 70 640 X and core i7 7740 X
perform and are they faster than the
mainstream KB Lake options well let's go
find out
as I just mentioned the KB like xcp you
still only feature a dual channel memory
controller
unlike the sky like X parts such as the
7800 X which do boast quad channel
memory support what this means is we see
the same 31 gigabytes per second of
memory bandwidth
we're running ddr4 3200 as we did with
the 7700 K and 7600 okay moving on we
have the Cinebench r15 results and well
I can't say the numbers here are at all
surprising that said despite their
slight frequency advantage the 77 40 X
and 70 640 X are both only able to match
the scores of their LGA 1151 versions at
this point we pretty much know
everything we need to know but what the
hell live runner heat more benchmarks we
might as well check them out
admittedly there are some slightly
interesting numbers here anyway take the
7-zip figures for example the 77 40 X
does manage to pull ahead of the 77 ok
though the same can't be said for the 76
40 X versus the 7600 K this time the 77
40 X was only able to match the 7700 our
Excel test while the 76 40 X actually
falls behind the 7600 K moving to the PC
mark 10 essentials benchmark the older
mainstream K V Lake parts provide the
best results here narrowly outscoring
the newer KB like X models so this is a
very disappointing results for Intel's
new high-end performance quad core
processors again the 7700 K and 7600 K
were able to outscore the 77 40 X and 70
640 X this time by a quite convincing
margin in the productivity tests
something very odd is going on here the
77 40 X n 70 640 X were much slower for
the photo editing test not sure what's
going on here these results don't really
make sense but I can assure you I did
double-check them finally the last PC
mark 10 tests and this time we're
looking at video editing performance and
here the older KB Lake CPUs again knock
after 7740 X and 70 640 X though only by
slim margin this term the corona
benchmark also favors of 77k and 7600 K
by a slim margin we also see the same
thing in the blender chest the 77 okay
in 7600 K were clearly faster I ran this
test three times on each CPU after a
full system reset each time and the LGA
1151 C
you's came out on top each time again we
see much the same in ham break the 7700
K and 7740 Axl much the same though the
7600 K did pull ahead of the 76 40 X the
last application we're going to look at
is Premiere Pro CC and again the
mainstream cable ache parts delivered
the best results we saw have the 77 40 X
and 70 640 X struggled in the
application tests and here we see much
the same in our first gaming benchmark
using battlefield one the 7700 K was 5%
faster than the 77 40 X when looking at
the minimum frame rate that's a decent
margin much the same were seen when
comparing the core i5 CPUs again this
time when testing with mafia 3 we see
that the main stream core i7 and core i5
CPU is provide the best results the
hitman performance is very similar and
the kb lakes and kb lake cpus traded
blows here the same is true for ashes of
the singularity as performance was much
the same on either platform now if you
thought kb lake x looked pretty ordinary
so far things are about to get a lot
worse for no added performance in fact
more often than not we saw a reasonable
decline in performance the cabe you like
X CPUs consume between 15 and 20% more
power under load in our excel test
perhaps were still at idle X to 99
platform can be thing consuming almost
20% more power at idle that's just
horrible but wait there's more terrible
news for would be kb lake expires
here we see under extended periods of
load the 7740 x and 7640 x consume over
40% more power
what ok let's wrap up this mess ok so
going into this review we already knew
that kb lake x wasn't really going to be
any good in fact quite the opposite
this was mostly down at the fact that
these quad-core CPUs really have no
place on the high-end desktop platform
no less 1 they can't actually fully
drive however adding insult to injury is
the weaker performance and increased
power consumption the performance issues
could easily be blamed on the X 299
board that we used after all the
motherboard manufacturers do seem as
though they're being used as a bit of a
scapegoat for this messy release by
Intel that said though the asrock X 299
Taichi that we used was absolutely
flawless when testing the higher-end
7800 x78 20x and
7900 X CPUs even so I did a bit of
looking around to see what others found
the slightly weaker performance seems to
be a platform issue of other reviewers
using a varying range of hardware found
the same mixed results as me with Kb
like X being slower for the most part
the confusing power consumption figures
that I found certainly haven't been seen
by all in fact private clock has found
the 77 40 X to consume 15 percent less
power than the 7700 K when comparing
total system consumption they use the
Isuzu prime X 299 deluxe motherboard for
those wondering meanwhile LAN OC found
the 7777 40 X to consume roughly the
same amount of power under load though
adalah 77 40 X was 16 percent hungrier
and again they use the asustor prime
external 9 deluxe so already two reviews
that are quite conflicted then lastly
I'll mention the vault has review which
found similar numbers to me under load
the 77 40 X system ate up 35 percent
more power than the 77 ok and they use
the gigabyte or SX 299 gaming 3 so blame
it on Kb like X the rush platform in
general or perhaps just the different
testing methods used by reviewers anyway
we all seem to agree that overall kb
lake X is actually slower than kb lake
and that's obviously very bad in the end
the core i7 77 40 X and Core i5 76 40 X
make absolutely no sense I can't think
of one good reason why they exist
honestly what was Intel thinking
wrapping things up I'll quote myself
from my intel core exercises AMD thread
ripper video published at the start of
Computex perhaps even more puzzling is
the 240 dollar core i5 77 40 X which is
another quad core part that lacks hyper
threading support so just four threads
are on offer here so for $20 more than
the Rison 5 1600 Intel's giving us a
traditional Core i5
I won't bother reading out the specs for
this one I'm pretty sure it's going to
be a waste of your time kind of like
another core i3 73 50 K situation I'll
pretty much simply tell you guys don't
buy it and here we are 5 weeks later and
I'm telling you guys not to buy KB like
X CPU who saw that coming anyway I'm
glad to have this one out of the way and
off my
chest I'm done with it I'm not going to
bother overclocking these chips deleting
them or anything like that they simply
shouldn't exist you shouldn't buy them
and so that information really shouldn't
be relevant next up for the core
x-series I do plan to compare the core
i7 7700
head-to-head with the six core Core i7
700 X to see if it's worth spending that
little bit extra on the more high-end
part and of course you do get those
extra cores and for that comparison I
will be comparing them overclocked as
well as stock and when it comes to the
value aspect I will be taking the entire
platform cost into consideration for
that battle after that I'll be updating
my rising gaming results and comparing
them with the equivalent Intel CPUs so
