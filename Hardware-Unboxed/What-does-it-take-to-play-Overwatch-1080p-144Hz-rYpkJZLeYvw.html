of what does it take to play previously
I looked at what kind of hardware gamers
need to play battlefield 1 multiplayer
@jp maintaining over 60 FPS at all times
the focus here is on new hardware so I
went with the core i5 6400 and the
Radeon rx 470 and that combo delivered
some very impressive results again for
those of you that missed the first
episode the point of this series is to
quickly show a gamers in five minutes or
less what kind of hardware they need to
achieve the set performance criteria an
overwhelmingly large number you asked me
to look at the overwatch multiplayer
performance next specifically what it
takes to play the game at 1080p on a 144
Hertz monitor using the ultra quality
settings so here we are as many of you
are probably aware it doesn't take much
to render this game at playable frame
rates even when using the ultra preset
however for competitive 144 Hertz setups
maintaining those kinds of frame rates
can be a challenge not only the gamers
require a decent GPU but the CPU is also
very important enabling and maintaining
these high frame rates I have found in
the past that the geforce gtx 1066
gigabyte is good for around 150 FPS at
TEP with the ultra quality settings it's
worth noting though that this
performance was recorded using my core
i7 test system overclocked to 4.5
gigahertz so telling you guys to get a
core i7 6700k or 77 okay along with the
gtx 1066 gigabyte probably isn't that
useful I mean if that's what it takes
sure but simply going out and buying the
fastest LGA 1151 processor isn't that
creative anyway as it turns out there is
a cheaper option I have found that the
6600 K or 7600 K is the sweet spot they
are essentially the same processor on
both costs 240 dollars u.s. actually in
Australia the 7600 K right now is about
10 dollars cheaper so you might as well
go that way the 7600 K is faster out of
the box thanks to a slight frequency
bump but of course these are unlocked
came also the out of the box frequency
is kind of irrelevant
clock for clock both deliver the exact
same performance as cable a cougher 0
IPC games over skylake for testing i
have used the 72nd RK and overclocked it
to aim
miles 4.5 gigahertz this was done in my
course our sponsored rigs I was using a
liquid cooler but this overclock can
easily be achieved using a $30 tailor
style cooler for example since this is
an unlocked processor you will want a
third series chipset dev 170 boards can
be had for as little as $90 US or 110
ozzie meanwhile then 270 boards are and
20% more expensive and I don't really
offer anything in the way of new
features but there's certainly an option
anyway so then with the core i5 7600 K
processor overclocked to 4.5 gigahertz
and the geforce gtx 1066 gigabyte
graphics card handling the rendering
work i found that for the most part this
configuration had no trouble keeping the
frame rate above 144 FPS full disclaimer
I am completely rubbish at overwatch I
never play the game as unfortunately I
just don't have time it seems like a
heap of fun though and at this point
I've only worked at a couple of the
characters still had a heap of fun over
the weekend playing this game and I went
through most of the maps and found that
this configuration delivers the perfect
balance of price versus performance for
144 hurt 1080p gamers I suspect an
unlocked core i5 processor going all the
way back to say the Sandy Bridge 2500 K
will be able to achieve similar
performance once overclocked gamers will
require a gtx 1066 gigabyte graphics
card though or something of you know
similar performance such as the gtx 980
back when i first tested overwatch i
threw more than 40 different GPUs at the
game and I found the r9 390x was
slightly slower than 1060 and therefore
so was the RX 480
it really took the nano to push ahead
nvidia does have a clear performance
advantage in this title finally as a
side note for those of you who may be
wondering this setup rendered between
100 and 140 FPS with the quality preset
set to epic so not quite good enough to
max out a 144 hertz display but still
certainly enough for smooth competitive
gameplay alright so that wraps this one
up I hope you guys enjoyed the overwatch
1080p 144 Hertz testing and if there are
any other games you would like me to
check out be sure to drop that in the
comments below just be sure to let me
know what the frame rate target is the
quality settings
and a resolution and I'll do my best to
make that happen
Armijo Steve have fun gaming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
