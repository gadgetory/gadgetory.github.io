with I guess Matt and Steve so that's a
yeah so as you you guys probably should
have seen the video we put up what would
have been last night you're gonna be
watching this on a one day time delay so
sorry about that but yeah yeah would
have been Sunday night would have put up
a video Matt explaining and myself about
the channel and the future and what the
deal with Matt is so that's not easy to
cover in one video we attempted to
anyway also this video was delayed
slightly because this morning I was on
the tech lounge with Brian and Kevin
hopefully because I that will be
happening tomorrow because like I said
this is a day late hopefully I don't
make an ass of myself but we'll find out
you'll know anyway by now I'll either
not be as happy about it but I'll sure
it'll be fine Brian and Kevin oh cool
guys so that should be a lot of fun in
the tech lounge but yeah there's no
point really really telling you about it
now because it will have already
happened but I guess you can jump over
to his channel and watch it the
livestream not live so anyway yeah so we
got a few boxes here and since Matt was
over on Sunday and we filmed that video
I thought why not do a delayed unboxing
boxes with Matt and Steve bit of fun so
we'll get to it let's do it the team
unbox we won't team our box aw reckon
that's probably interest yeah -
dangerous for us to choreograph that
properly but I'll give you the knife
this one is addressed to Matt and it
looks like it's a care package from
Coolermaster so there's a knife if you
need that haven't got the NOI learned
away no noise disappointment it's a
light box no couldn't even give you a
slight yes dean here the care package
from cool master any others
you're something cool yeah be very cool
it's very small come on call the last
what big gifts they're big
Julian edibles Matt get your first
Christmas card probably and get left out
on this where's my Christmas card
season's greetings dear Matt thank you
for your support in 2016
wish you and your family a Merry
Christmas and Happy New Year best
regards cool master how lovely
made my day and your present a little
wooden box hanging off it what's in the
little wooden box it's a cool box little
black pack with some dope Sony's we're
gonna fight over this yep yeah cool
pretty cool yeah thanks cool masculine
article cool alright Beauty what I can
stop I'll put this over here oh it's my
turn
umm I will I got this big one I reckon
since you've got the glasses I'm getting
the largest box to unbox mmm yeah that's
just how it's gonna happen hopefully
there's nothing pulling at this end oh I
can't actually show that that happened
to me I think it was about two episodes
ago yeah wonder what it is damn well
yeah that's disappointing but I picked
that one
you know this stuff yeah well that was
it not very eventful there's actually
nothing else in there
yeah all right Logitech bucks think I
know what might be in here and it's been
a much-needed no there's two things
oh yeah you'll definitely be needing
this ah indeed I will obey yep that is
the C 9 to 2 pro stream webcam from
Logitech and this is pretty much the
bee's knees for streaming at the moment
and since I am going to be on the tech
lounge what is it
before earlier today
I will be needing this so I asked
logitech if they could provide me with
one for the live stream and they said
yes more than happy to do so so there it
is I like to plug that in and work it
out and yeah should be cool so anyway
actually I'll take it out quickly have a
bit of a little what's the price of this
one that is 125 Ozzie or one no 92 92
u.s. or 125 Ozzie yep Cheers yeah it's
more than I imagined but then I suppose
I don't know why what I thought it'd be
big just expect a good camera to be big
in you
so that would clip on something like
that
and then there's USB to your computer
it's got built-in mic and it does 1080p
high definition HD is a marketing term I
think it's 60 FPS this is full HD at 30
fps 20 or 60 okay yes yeah that's I
think that's pretty good for webcam so
yeah anyway I don't know much about this
and I know very little about webcams as
evident by my knowledge there should be
good for the live stream are you feeding
that down here it says probably upstairs
and the new benchmark lab that way when
Brian asked me a question I quickly jump
on Wikipedia to answer all right the
other box in here is the g4 to Hyperion
fury which I think I mentioned before is
actually my favorite gaming mouse
it's not their most high-end Mouse by
any means but I guess that's what I used
for a long time and to me it's just got
the perfect amount of buttons perfect
shape and that sort of thing so this you
can grab for just 45 Ozzie or 33 US
dollars now so yeah it's a not a wallet
breaker no it's a really good price for
days I used this mouse before map dude I
think must be an advanced warfare we
were playing when I had that mouse and I
kept dominating Matt as you might
imagine and he's like what I remember
and he said what me are using I showed
him and then straight away Matt fell in
love with it and I think I moved to the
502 n yeah that Matt's been using this
ever since hasn't wanted to change and
yeah it's a really really well priced
Mouse yeah except you Matt did break
ease which is why yeah yeah I think I
press the middle mouse button the wrong
way because it's been a couple of months
of use over a pretty sensitive time I
suppose but I think I pushed it sideways
or something and that makes the little
button in there or the switch fall out
of alignment anyway so I I've been
playing battlefield to death and a few
other games and yeah I had to really jam
the middle mouse button down to get it
to activate so Logitech were kind enough
to send a new one so I'm very very happy
about that so that's the real reason why
Matt hasn't been making videos who's
been breaking mice playing Battlefield
one that's the true story guys yeah yeah
this is just the perfect mouse to me
with clicky buttons it's got these two
extra buttons which you know you don't
need many more than that you can click
this oh I like the middle mouse is
actually firm I find a lot of middle
mouse and scroll wheels to be sort of
loose and not you ain't get that
satisfying click this once is perfect
and then you just got the sniper button
on the right on the left as well so nice
unless you want cool well maybe this is
my time hopefully the product in here
isn't something under NDA it's probably
a core i7 77 are okay
probably yeah Oh No but this is actually
for the cabbie lake or kb lake or
however you want to say it what did you
how did you pronounce it hey I saw some
reason I say cabbie but looking around
YouTube it's a 50/50 card to make up
your own mind yeah yeah that's it we say
cash though ya know so many people talk
no Australians don't say facial oh
really yeah
are you sure you're Australian try
google it yeah well yeah that's it
so we have more g.skill try and z memory
we have a lot of this memory but it's
all sort of in use and it is awesome
memory and this will be going in a a
cabbie or KB wake build so I'll be cool
and we got so much is actually here in
total what have we got there it's a 64
gig kits there must be a gig modules so
yeah 864 yeah we phone calculator yeah
yeah yeah will you that if you want but
I think you guys will have seen this
memory on the channel quite a bit over
the last few months cuz we've used it
for several bills we used it in that
build that map palmed off to me the
$1200 1440p bill that was pretty awesome
so we used two sticks of this I think
for a 16 gig kit if memory serves me
correctly yeah so more memory for
testing the upcoming seventh generation
Intel Core series and we'll have that's
coming up on though you guys don't know
it's not really a secret at this point
but on the 4th of January that review
will be landing and I think I'll be
wrapping the core i7 and core i5
processors into the same review because
yeah they're not let's be honest they're
not terribly exciting and we're all sort
of waiting for Zen or Rison and I have
no idea when that's coming but we
believe sometime in January so that
should be cool and I'll also have a
January's gonna suck to be honest
yeah it's really I'm already planning
for January now just been testing GPUs
and CPUs non-stop to have all the
results are ready for when they come in
and get that done it because this guys
aren't helping me come back after all
Simpsons yeah so yeah so that was a well
so we're sort of quick I don't really
know how long we've been talking felt
pretty cool like we've just maybe were
just having fun
yeah well this thing didn't oh yeah
really did we do well we did to Logitech
products yeah we did some g.skill memory
which we didn't go into and too much
depth because you've seen that what a
dozen times now on the channel so nice
and the Sony's they were cool where the
Sony's actually we need to do a bit of a
straw poll here who do the Sony's look
cool or hang around skies yeah they are
map they really see me happy they're a
bit small for my head they III let's
have a big head I thought I would be
good so I benchmarking knowledge yeah so
unfortunately I'll probably the last
time you see Matt for a little while
it's the thing there's one or two
reviews you wanna do yeah coming up soon
of them sue them anticipate or planned
but yeah hopefully before long we can
get Matt and back on the channel we can
be doing sort of regular stuff like this
yeah with the tour bus let us know
anyway if you guys thought it was cool
having us both do the unboxing
definitely adds a bit more of a dynamic
and me do some I just prefer you know
let me droning on about cases and please
don't go easy on that guys I need help
it's too hard to he was by myself oh
yeah so I think that we'll leave it
there wraps it up wrap that one out so
you can take the no not as always thanks
for tuning you I've been your host Matt
as occasionally and this has been Steve
who it's pretty much always on it so uh
yeah thanks for tuning in and we'll
catch you guys next
