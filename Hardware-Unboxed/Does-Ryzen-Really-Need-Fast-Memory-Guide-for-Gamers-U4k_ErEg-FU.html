today's video has nothing to do with
risin hmm that doesn't see what it could
be right no that's wrong
today's video we're actually looking at
rising memory performance again now you
might be thinking hang on a minute Steve
didn't you make me sit through a
13-minute video not two weeks ago that
disgust Rises memory performance what
more needs to be said well firstly
thanks for bolstering the channels watch
time YouTube might actually start
serving me some good ads now and I'll be
able to eat three meals a day so the
reason we're doing this all over again
is because the previous video looked at
risings memory performance from a
completely different angle the idea
behind that video was to investigate
claims that rise and scales better with
higher clocked memory than say KB Lake
does it was suggested that using ddr4
3,600 memory would see risin 7 overtake
the core i7 77 okay in most games anyway
this turn out to be completely false as
it was discovered in every single game
tested except for ashes at the
singularity escalation that the 7700 K
under clock to 4 gigahertz while still
faster than the 1800 X clocked at the
same frequency now the point isn't to
make Rison 7 look bad in fact given the
choice of the core i7 7700 K or the rise
in 7 1700 I would go with horizon every
time instead the point of all this rise
in testing from day one has been to try
and learn what the strengths and
weaknesses of this new processor
architecture are how it works and what
the consumer can do to get the most out
of their setup anyway so we've
established that it's perfectly fine to
bench mark Rison at the same memory
frequency of an intel competitor and
this is because for the most part the
margins gonna be much the same whether
your test with ddr4 3200 or 2133 for
example in the previous video we saw
pretty consistent scaling and almost all
the games tested right up to ddr4 3200
using the gtx 1080 TI as a result the
takeaway from most seem to be they would
need to invest an expensive high
frequency memory to get the most out of
their rising CPU and well given the
results I showed I can certainly see how
you'd come to that conclusion the
problem though being that most probably
won't buy a GeForce GTX to
ATI graphics card statistically
something like the GTX 1060 or rx 480 is
far more likely this is a problem
because with these graphics cards gamers
are heavily GPU bound in almost every
game they play providing to have a
decent quad-core CPU of better so the
advantage higher clocked memory hands
the CPU isn't realized with a slower
graphics card for gamers what this means
is purchasing the 175 dollar u.s.
g.skill memory that we use might not
actually translate into any additional
performance when compared to the 100
dollar version rated at ddr4 2400 that
money then would be far better invested
in a faster GPU or maybe a CPU or
perhaps even more memory capacity okay
so at this point I've waffled on quite a
bit you probably now realize that you
might not need the fastest memory
available but you probably still don't
know what kind of memory you actually
need to answer that we need to jump into
the benchmarks but before we do that
here are a few quick details all testing
was conducted using the horizon 7 1800 X
processor clocked at 4 gigahertz but the
findings will be true for any Rison 7 or
verizon 5 processor for that matter in
total I have tested 6 demanding titles
with the geforce gtx 1060 gtx 1070 and
gtx 1080i the memory speeds will be
comparing our ddr4 2133 2666 and 3200 ok
that's everything let's check out what
we found
Mass Effect Andromeda is primarily a GPU
bound game and we find this when testing
with the gtx 1080i that said the upgrade
from ddr4 2133 to 2666 did boost the
minimum or the 0.1% result by 6 percent
so that's a reasonable gain however when
you re test with the gtx 1070 we see no
such gains just one FPS separates the
fastest configuration from the slowest
and that's margin of error stuff the
same is true when using the gtx 1060
here we see the memory frequency has no
noticeable impact on the performance at
all
heman is a very CPU intensive game and
right now it throws up some interesting
results or rather slightly confusing
results with Rison for whatever reason
rising heavily limits the performance of
nvidia is higher in GPUs in this title
it's either a display driver issue or a
lack of optimization on the games we
have
but whatever the case the average
framerate is a bit misleading here it's
not often you'll see the GTX 1060
trailing the gtx 980ti by little over
ten percent the 1080i should be well
over twice as fast when fully Unleashed
anyway if we look at the minimum
reported frame rate we see that Rison
does benefit from the higher clocked
memory even with the gtx 1070 though
ddr4 2666
is coming close to extracting the
maximum performance here when it comes
to the gtx 1060 the minimum is much the
same regardless of the memory speed
though we do see a slight bump in the
average frame rate still the variance
between 21 33 and 3,200 memory is just
8% with the 1060 opposed to 17% with the
1070 mafia 3 is another good example of
a game that's not just heavy on the GPU
but also the CPU previously when testing
with the gtx 1080i we saw massive
performance gains from using the higher
clocked memory the boost from 21 33 to
3,200 notice almost 40% more frames
which is quite incredible however before
you race out and spend big on high-speed
memory stop and think what kind of
graphics card you will be using here we
see when using the gtx 1070 that
previously seen gain of almost 40%
evaporates to virtually nothing the
minimum frame rate was improved by
almost 10% when going from 2133 to 3200
though there was virtually nothing to be
gained when upgrading from 2666 now with
an even slower graphics card when using
the gtx 1060 we see there are no gains
to be had at all the gtx 1016 ir x 480
are hardly what I would consider slow
and many gamers will be using less
capable graphics cards so for these
users memory frequency really isn't a
big deal but let's move on and check out
a few more games before making our final
conclusion Deus Ex mankind divided isn't
a heavy CPU user but even so we found
when using the GTX 10 atti memory speed
matters the difference between ddr4 2133
and 3200 was noticeable as we saw a 14%
increase in the average frame rate and
the all-important minimum was also
boosted by 13% now with the gtx 1070
those glorious gains are gone the
average is within the margin of error
and the same is true for the 0.1% frame
time when comparing ddr4 2666 and 32
100 once we filtered down to the GTX
1060 there's no real gains worth talking
about and everything is again within the
margin of error battlefield 1 is another
game that saw huge performance gains
when using the higher clocked memory
with the GTX 10 atti
however once we dropped down to the gtx
1070 those gains are nowhere to be seen
as the rise in CP was able to attract
the maximum performance out of this
graphics card using ddr4 2133 that being
the case we obviously found the same
thing with the gtx 1060 wrapping up the
testing we have ashes of the singularity
escalation which has been tested using
the high quality preset as you can see
we are heavily cpu-bound in this test
when using the gtx 1080 TTI as a result
the gtx 1070 provided the exact same
performance when using ddr4 2133 and
2666 memory it wasn't until we moved to
3,200 memory that the 1080 TI
configuration started to pull away
because this is such an extreme example
of a CPU bound game memory frequency
makes a huge difference even when using
the gtx 1070
that said though dropping down to the
gtx 1060 we did see little to no
difference between the various memory
frequencies for the average framerate we
see that ddr4 2666 was 4 percent faster
than 2133 though moving from 2666 to
3200 Netta's just two extra frames so
even with an extreme example such as
ashes of the singularity memory speed
makes little difference for those using
a mid-range graphics card so as you've
just seen depending on the graphics card
used and the games you intend on playing
investing in premium high frequency
memory might not be the best use of your
hard-earned cash let's take a look at
the average figures across five of the
six games tests that I am excluding
ashes of the singularity here as that
was measured a bit differently this
reflects pretty well what we just saw
using the gtx 1080 TI arisin allowed for
around 17% more performance meanwhile
that margin was reduced to almost
nothing
with the gtx 1070 as we see a negligible
5% performance boost then with the gtx
1060 we're working well within the
margin of error at most a 3% gain can be
seen when boosting the memory frequency
by 50% right so those rocking a
mid-range graphics card don't really
need to worry about memory frequency
you're better off saving your money and
expanding the
memory capacity or perhaps even
upgrading another component as it stands
ddr4 2133 and 2400 memory are fairly
evenly priced in fact in a number of
cases the slower memory actually costs a
little more looking at G skills flair X
range the 16 gigabyte dual channel 2400
kits currently cost around a hundred and
fifteen dollars the same price is the
2133 stuff while the 3200 version we use
is priced at one hundred and
seventy-five dollars u.s. of course it's
possible to overclock ddr4 memory so
stuff that's rated at 2400 can often be
pushed to 20 666 or 2933 or even higher
by adjusting the memory timings and
voltages that said as always with
overclocking your mileage will vary
depending on the type of memory you have
your motherboard and even the quality of
your CPU right now based on pricing and
of course the performance just seen in
this video ddr4 2402 2666 looks to be
the sweet spot and this is certainly the
memory of frequencies I would recommend
for anyone running a gtx 1070 or slower
likewise these memory recommendations
also apply for anyone using a verizon 7
or aizen 5 processor as well as anything
on the intel side such as the core i3
Core i5 or even core i7 well I hope that
clears up the memory confusion for
consumers and as always if you have any
other questions feel free to drop them
below and I'll do my best to answer them
as quickly as possible I'm your host
Steve thanks for watching and I'll catch
you again soon
