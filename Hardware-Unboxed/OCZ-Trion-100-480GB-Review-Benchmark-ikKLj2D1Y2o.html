unboxed I'm Harris Matt and today we've
got OCD or ocz I'm going to go with Oh
Sees dead since we're Ozzy we've got
their new trying 100 480 gigabyte SSD on
hand for a quick performance test we're
kind of interested in this model because
it's the first SSD to come out at the
now toshiba own ocz that's actually to
Shiva built not just using Toshiba and
although the try 100 has been branded as
an o Caesar product and has been
developed entirely by Toshiba with no
help from ursa is dead other than a bit
of beta testing if you will the try and
100 is a budget focused SSD series it
takes advantage of to shave is a 19
nanometer 128 gigabyte TLC NAND flash
memory with a claim sequential read
speed of five hundred and fifty
megabytes per second and a right speed
of 530 megabytes per second it wasn't
that long ago that OC dead pushed out
the Roman budget SSD series the aarc 100
which uses toshibas MLC NAND flash
memory despite the fact that the aarc
100 series is more costly and slower
than the competition Oh Sees that will
continue to persevere with it rather
than replace it with the try 100 the try
100 uses the toshiba tec 58 controller
which ozz and toshiba caesar toshiba
creation along with the firmware many
have noticed the close similarities
between the TC 58 PCB and that of the
fires and s10 so it seems likely that
toshiba is rebranding the controller and
created their own firmware but for now
this is just speculation the aarc 100
480 gigabyte model costs 177 dollars
while the tri 100 480 gigabyte model
cost 180 dollars so it'll be interesting
to see how they compare in terms of
performance having said that let's check
out the benchmarks now first up we'll
take a look at the d results in
terms of read access time the tri 100
manage point zero six six milliseconds
been only by Samsung's 850 pro it also
performed quite well in bright access
time an d at just point zero seven
mil
seconds next we tested sequential read
performance for crystal dis mark with
the try 100 scored a rather good 534
megabytes per second in terms of
sequential write performance it was
edged out slightly by the 850 Evo and
again beaten by the 850 Pro random 512k
read performances where the try 100
started to fall down it managed just 396
megabytes per second and felt a fourth
position on our graph random 512k write
performance is worse the try 100 only
managed 291 megabytes per second which
was well shy / other test models random
4k read performance is no better
managing just 22 megabytes per second
and random 4k write performance was also
poor just 44 megabytes per second we
next tested with pcmark 7 and in the
video editing test the OC said try and
manage to meet you 146 megabytes per
second well behind its rivals pc marks
gaming tests was no better with just 86
megabytes per second and again falling
well behind its rival SSDs our final
test was in pcmark aids storage
bandwidth test the try 100 fell short
again was only able to throughput 177
megabytes per second compared to 291
from Samsung as 850 Evo model the try
and won hundreds performances lackluster
at best and when compared to other
budget SSDs such as the crucial be X 100
or Samsung 850 Evo it's clearly
outclassed unfortunately with less than
stellar performance the only possible
saving grace could be the price without
a hundred and eighty dollars the try 100
480 gigabyte model is no cheaper than
the beer to 100 while it costs more than
the 850 Evo also Oh Sees data only
offers a three year warranty and 120
gigabyte endurance rating which makes it
an even tougher sell compared to
Samsung's 850 Evo which comes with a 5
year warranty thanks for watching this
