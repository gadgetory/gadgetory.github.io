it's not that time of the month we
normally do it towards the end of the
month but we've jumped ahead and we're
doing a mid month QA rather than the end
of the month we've had sea yes so
there's a few exciting things to talk
about
plus we're in the middle of a bit of it
a heat wave here in Melbourne so we
thought what better time to hop in the
garage and do a long Q&amp;amp;A session it's
just perfect yeah feel the heat coming
off the tin door and all that so it's
great but you ain't plenty of questions
I think this is a record number question
bumfuck wish I was 300 so plenty of
answering to be done let's get into it
okay you're paying attention you're
ready this is the first question I'm
ready really always it is from say what
do I have to reel up I guess I guess
yeah forever like no I'll do it say what
edit the first one out make it difficult
finish first question is is radion 7/8
success or fail I know we have a limited
info only from Amy's keynote but looks
to be around
RTX 2080 performance yeah tell me a fail
I think it'll be fine yeah again we
haven't got one we have a review now we
don't have one so yeah we haven't signed
an NDA and that says we can refer you to
say whatever we like as you said them it
seems like it's gonna be around RTX 2080
performance for RTX 2080 pricing power
consumption efficiency is probably not
going to be as good so yeah
okay another patreon question this one
is from boot man is the core i5 the same
silicon as the i7 so is it just with
part of the CPU fused off is that
microcode that they've used to turn
things like hyper-threading off or is it
a completely different school different
silicon altogether so basically they're
asking your core i7 8700 k for example
has hyper-threading and it's unlocked
whereas say the core i5 8400 has no
hyper threading and it's at a lot
frequency so how they achieving that is
basically the question so I think well I
know the answer you know the answer yeah
explain it I mean we had to look this
one up but well yeah we wait one of two
options basic yeah so it's definitely
the same silicon because it's not worth
making an entirely new dye for each
individual variant that you want to make
you want to have as few of those as
possible saves you whole bunch of
engineering costs so the options were
between your micro code updates or
physical fusing and sounds like a while
back it was all done just through micro
code but then people figured out ways to
get around that so now it is definitely
fused in the hardware so the things that
just basically fully locked off on the
hardware so you can't ever enable them
things like you need your cache size
your hyper 3 and those areas are
definitely Hardware fused at the moment
yep pimp daddy Jesus from her discord
chat has asked us this question do you
think there will be a range of CPUs on
the new x 599 platform filling the gap
between the old 18 core and the new 28
chord since this segment is already a
niche of a niche I can't see budget
oriented shoppers looking for
entry-level things at this price level
based on the ridiculous Dominus extreme
I have a hard time seeing entry-level X
599 boards being a thing there either so
X $5.99 it seems to be the name that
Intel is going to use for their Xeon w
platforms that's that much larger socket
to fit that 28 core CP that's
effectively a Z on platinum that's just
now a workstation CPU somehow as
fulfilling the gap between 1800 and 28
core I mean maybe it seems like they
consider doing that because there's
already Zeon's that fill all those
different core yeah I mean I guess the
thing is you know is this just meant to
be a high-end workstation platform which
case then you basically you just you buy
the 28 chord that's what it's offered
you buy the expensive motherboard you go
all out or are they thinking you know we
should offer a $500 cheaper CPU that has
slightly fewer cause I'm not sure I
think I knew that we net core has been
announced yeah I'd hate to
and that's all we would be doing I mean
there could be a 22 24 26 28 who'd be
surprised by that kind of thing it makes
no sense but then we have a we have what
a 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 so was that really
necessary but I think they'll probably
stick with the 28 just as a premium
product it's kind of weird having one
CPU for a platform but then the platform
so ridiculous that yeah it's really only
a flagship part platform yeah I think if
that's that thing of when you're jumping
into that platform you're really all in
on you get the CPU motherboard combo if
that's it that's your workstation now
yeah I think so it's not really any room
to move there to now but we'll see how
that plays out when it's all released
all right next question is from crossed
out because I know gamers Nexus did a
video on this recently but at what point
I would just start recommending 7700 K
owners start looking towards an upgrade
have you noticed any bottlenecks when
using them both in gaming and production
environments I've had mine for around
two years before horizon was even a
thing personally okay well I mean for
productivity type stuff it's clearly a
bottleneck if you're doing encoding or
rendering or anything like that I mean
it doesn't slow anything else down it
just does it as fast as it can do it
stuff you want to do it faster than you
need an 87 okay no no okay or a rise in
platform as for gaming I don't think
they'll be really any games do you ever
you don't have a 77 I don't know he's
only got an 87 or K'naan yeah look I've
used even the Haswell core i7s and
they're still fine battlefield 5
multiplayer no dramas there I think the
77 are OK by memory did extremely well
in my battlefield 4 battlefield 5 64
player multiplayer benchmark so I don't
think so I mean if you you would need a
really high end GPU like something like
your r-tx 20 70 so that's what your GT X
1080 type performance Vegas 64 it'll be
perfectly fine for that if you're buying
an r/t X 20 atti then you know are we
really talking about using seventh
generation Intel Core processors you'd
just buy
okay yeah either a 99 or okay or an 80
somewhere it has something like that but
yeah I don't think you gonna see frames
stuttering or any issues in any games so
you can certainly make do with that for
the forseeable okay another good
question from a discord chat here this
time about Intel obtained persistent
memory this person says that'll prove to
be amazing the server space down in 2019
but when will this tech reach consumers
if ever and will it change the way
memory allocation works in general low
latency persistent storage looks amazing
for upcoming work loads including gaming
yeah it looks really cool to have that
sort of you know basically a memory
module that you slot in to effectively a
dim slot and it just high-bandwidth
low-latency effectively you're combining
the benefits of having RAM with the
benefit serving an SSD into the one sort
of thing because there's only coming
into the server space starting with
Intel's upcoming platforms this year
you'd think it's a fair way from being
available for consumers
I think Intel would have plans to
produce it for consumers at some point
it's just that it's a fair way away and
the question is well we were talking
about this earlier is potentially there
would be a new technology that comes out
by the time that it's ready for
consumers then your superior and they
might just skip to that yeah well
something along those lines so it's a
question of how affordable that tech is
we're still not really sure so that will
play a big part in determining when that
will come to consumers as well but
certainly it looks like a really
promising technology and should become
that sort of high-end storage device
probably superseding nvme PCIe drives
cuz you always have your solder drives
as your affordable you know faster than
a hard drive massive capacities we're
seeing that now I think nvme drives have
a big there's a bigger opportunity to
replace those with obtained persistent
yeah I mean if there was an option for
it to come much sooner at the desktop I
don't think there's much demand because
they like yeah nvme storage gamers
aren't demanding that it's kind of nice
to have it at an affordable price but
it's not in high demand because once you
get in the games you don't get more
frames you may load into the game it's
that much quicker which is
some people kind of nice but yeah it's
not really going to change things
massively like the first SSDs did ya the
first side or SSDs that was a huge leap
forward from hard drives phenomenal but
Yael be some time before we see
something like that again I think if
ever yeah
alright codger face has a very important
question and he's not afraid to hide it
he says possibly the most important
question of all time what is the
official accepted acronym for hardware
unbox so is it h ub hub is it h w you
what o is it h wub which probably the
most correct at all of those and then is
it is it t YC a for tech city for a
check yes City fan site which one I
think Brian would like the T ycf acronym
for harbor unboxed but well we've sort
of always gone with hub h ub doesn't
make a lot of sense because unboxed the
be it's not really a separate word well
I don't think we ever rah I suppose we
did in some videos we referred to a bit
something that everyone just sort of
went with so we say hub because it's the
easiest to say if it's HW use like what
yeah
HW you be wob yet a even H you which
would be the correct acronym hardware is
one word unbox is another word it's like
huh that's not very good hub yeah it
doesn't make the most sense but it's the
easiest to say which is I think why we
sent tend to go with that yeah it's not
again it's not like we we use a lot
I don't yeah we don't refer to ourselves
as hub ever in the videos I don't have a
logo that has hub on and it's always
hard brown box yeah say I don't think
it's a look it's a super important
question room card your face there but I
don't think it's a yep it's gonna go
change too much overall so yeah we'll
move on okay question here from you know
just AJ hopefully I got that right
discord member I believe is that yeah
that's right will AMD's Navi take a big
enough step away from there GC and
architecture
and why is it important nice sort of
speculative
circulation there I'm gonna hand this
over to Tim because he says he's our new
speculation expert so again we don't
know what is coming up in na'vi so
basically we're just having a bit of a
guess here I think it would it seems
like it's still gonna be based on GCN in
some form that seems to be the sort of
leading theory at the moment couldn't
say that's confirmed or anything it's
just a theory at this stage so I think
there will be some changes to allow them
to get better efficiency certainly they
need to you know innovate in that area
to make their products more competitive
so I think they'll be doing some things
there but I would imagine that'll be
similar enough to GC and in a lot of
ways and I think though it will be quite
an important architecture of them
because I expect this is the
architecture that will be used for next
generation consoles and I suspect a lot
of engineering work has gone into that
architecture specifically for that
because it seems to be lining up with
the 2020 timeframe so you know you get
this architecture out late 2019 is
probably going to be right around the
money for the next-gen consoles combined
with sin too so yeah I think it'll be
important for them in that sense but
it's too early to say about specific
architecture features or anything like
that you care to comment on pricing okay
could you give a straight face all right
we'll move along swiftly gather the are
deep waters there and the next question
is from Nick I'm about to enter the
world of 4k 144 Hertz
HDR g-sync gaming godlike level stuff
there obviously there's no GPU in the
world that can do 144 FPS and triple-a
titles on Ultra at 4k yet but I'd like
to eke out a little extra performance
what method would you guys recommend for
getting a few extra frames for example
set the resolution of 1440 P set it to
1,800 P or just lower quality settings
sort of reckon Tim I mean my first port
of call would be I always like to game
at the native monitor resolution so if
I've got a 4k monitor I want to be
gaming at 4k and that's not saying I
personally by 4k more
probably by 1440p monitor and just to
get that better balance of you know
performance to to quality so I guess I
would be lowering the quality things I
think you're probably still struggle to
get up to that 144fps
mark yeah but certainly if you get to
around 100 FPS or 80 to 100 with say
medium to high quality that's probably
I'd go for yeah i would go down scaling
personally having said that though it's
like a lot of these questions and every
toy at benchmarking FPS performance like
sort of stuff it's really depends on the
game so shut over the tomb raider i
assume you're using an RT x 28 e TI
because that would make sense with a
treat and dollar US panel yeah so if
using a 90 X 28 ETI tomb raider looks
pretty awesome use Tim's optimize guide
you get like 80 FPS and for tomb raider
that's plenty
games a lot of fun looks amazing you're
playing battlefield 5 i'd probably down
scale there i just ever so slightly and
most like fortnight even our downs well
you don't need to import no it's
probably a bad example but you can down
scale on that title as well so initially
for k you can turn it down to like 90 80
percent resolution and you're not
getting a yeah like this if you're 1800
pay you sort of social setting would
work well yeah i'm i'm more for doing
that than actually reducing quality
settings that will have a noticeable
impact i know going from ultra high and
a lot of tiles doesn't but i'd rather
have just better quality shadows and
things like that rather than the sharper
resolution yeah fair enough okay this is
another question from our discord chat
trying to find a decent priced
HDR ultra-wide with a hundred hertz
forgot to mention with LFC any
suggestions so the answer to that
question is there are no decent HDR
option wide panels at the moment you can
get a lot of ones that have okay ish but
HDR but if you see my video is sort of
discussing what you need for an h gr
panel which is high brightness contrast
and color space it's usually the
contrast of the three metrics that these
monitors fail because they don't have
local dimming so right now there's no
Ultra wide panels that have good enough
local dimming in my opinion there are
some that do have local dimming in large
zones but I'd prefer a high zone count
and so far that there what there is an
ultra wide monitor coming with a large
local dimming array I think it's five
twelve zones
it's supposed to be thirty four forty by
1440 200 Hertz but those have been
delayed and we're not quite sure when
that's coming that would be the first
decent HDR ultra wide panel but for now
if you're buying an ultra wide I
probably wouldn't consider I would look
into the HDR performance I just sort of
discount that and buy it as an SDR panel
because a lot of the powers just simply
aren't good enough right now in my
opinion blue flame has asked us in a
Dischord chat have you guys considered
benchmarking games with custom quality
settings I feel like spending money just
a game on the ultra preset is a complete
scam because in 99% of cases it's
impossible to tell the difference
between ultra and high and in most cases
I would argue it's close to impossible
to tell the difference between medium
and ultra yeah I mean that's something
that we're sort of exploring a little
bit I've been doing the optimization
guides for sort of the second half of
last year's games and that's sort of to
do exactly what you've been saying to
find the settings that give the best
balance between visual quality and
performance and often that's not running
it at Ultra it's running it at a
combination of medium high and ultra
settings usually tends to be the right
sort of mix and yeah I mean it's a very
good point is that you know you don't
necessarily need to run on ultra to get
you know the best visual quality you can
get it's very tiny reduction we get
massive performance improvement from
turning few things down and that is
something that we want to you know
continue to do going forward because
it's important to know these sort of
things I think yes well it depends on
what the content is trying to do so if
it's a game benchmark we're obviously
evaluating the game performance so what
kind of hardware you need to play that
game generally for my big so they're not
day one but my soon after release forty
fifty sixty GPU benchmarks presets makes
sense there because Tim hasn't spent
days and days going through all the
settings and working out what works best
where so I just choose generally I
choose a preset then if there's
something like godrays or something to
complete
Rex the performance I turn that off
manually and let you guys know but the
point is in that instance we're looking
at game performance now if I'm doing a
big GPU comparison
I'm not too concerned with the quality
settings there because I'm more just
wanting to test everything under the
same conditions to see because if it's
30% faster with ultra saying rx 580
versus a 1060 not that you'd see a
margin that big with those two but that
you would see that other quality preset
so I do quality scaling in the day one
stuff and generally we see from low
medium high ultra similar scaling
between between GPUs so in that instance
it doesn't really matter something
really again as I said it depends on
what the video is looking into yeah I
think a lot of people are expecting from
that coverage to see ultra settings
because yeah I guess using custom scenes
is more of a nitch thing still I think a
lot of people still just interested in
you know what frame rate am I going to
get in this game with my card on ultra
settings there's a few things people
don't like you cherry-picking the
settings they like to go with the
presets that's I mean obviously opinions
vary but we can it takes a bit of it off
us if we just go look we test every game
with ultra unless there's something
obvious that everyone agrees with like
hair works or whatever that should be
turned off it makes it easier for us if
we start managing what we're turning on
people like I you turn that on because
it favors in video or AMD or whatever so
it removes a little bit of that crazy
obviously the more of that you can
remove from that kind of content the
better and I have started using like our
hub type of quality settings which I
think a lot of you do like because you
watch Tim's guides but there are a few
people who don't like that because
they're like well what settings are
these now I have to go back and find
that video to find what settings you've
used and I kind of get that again though
as long as they're all tested under the
exact same conditions there's nothing
that really sways the results in favor
of one card it doesn't matter too much
okay that concludes part one plenty of
good questions and as usual we do like
to split these up so it doesn't run a
hole well 20 minutes I think retarget so
yeah they're finally that was 20 minutes
of awesome viewing and we can do it all
again tomorrow but anyway thank you for
watching part 1 of the January Q&amp;amp;A our
first
one of 2019 hopefully we start up with a
bit of a bang good questions I reckon
loads of good questions and I yeah we'll
get to the rest of them in part two so
yeah thanks for watching you can like
subscribe follow us on patreon if you
want to do that and I think that is
about everything see you next time see
