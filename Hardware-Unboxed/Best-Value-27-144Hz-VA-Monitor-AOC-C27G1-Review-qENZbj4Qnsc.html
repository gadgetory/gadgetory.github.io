we're looking at an affordable gaming
monitor from AOC this c-27j one in
Australia this is currently the cheapest
27-inch 144 Hertz display you can get at
PC case get with the price of just 339
Aussie dollar e-news making it only
slightly more expensive than the 24-inch
equivalents it's also quite good value
in the United States at $280 which is
around the mark of other 27-inch high
refresh monitors without being an I
guess a standout value option but of
course the price tag doesn't tell us
anything about the quality of the
monitor so let's take a look and see
what you can get at this price point
quick overview of the specs first as I
mentioned it's a 27-inch 144 Hertz panel
as you might have guessed for a budget
display is just 1080p it's also curved
with a 1700 hour curvature it uses VA
technology and it supports free sync in
terms of design AOC has gone with
something quite basic the monitor is
branded as a gaming monitor beside from
a few red highlights around the place NC
hasn't gone overboard with ugly gamer
style elements most of the exterior
construction uses basic cheapish plastic
with the matte finish which keeps them
on it is designed simple whether you're
looking from the front or the back where
Elsie has a leg up on the competition is
in its 10th most budget monitors just
give you tilt adjustment but the c-27j
one has full height adjustment as well
as swivel support at the base you can't
rotate the monitor into a portrait
orientation but that wouldn't make sense
as the motor is curved the stand is also
pretty sturdy and of course you also get
visa mounting support
aside from there being nothing overly
special about the G once designed my
only real complaint is the lack of a
directional toggle for the on-screen
display if you've watched any of my past
monitor reviews this complaint keeps
popping up and I think it's especially
important for a monitor like this there
are quite a lot of controls in the OSD
and the four buttons along the bottom
edge make it hard to navigate what else
I guess in terms of input is all common
stuff two HDMI ports display port VGA
and 3.5 millimeter headphone jack the
free sync range doesn't matter because
every 144 Hertz fruit sync monitor
supports low framerate compensation and
as for the curve I prefer this monitor
was flat
that's a personal preference thing and
depending on your region you might not
find a flat equivalent that's as
affordable let's move into talking about
how the c-27j one performs starting with
response times IOC is trying to fight
their response time numbers on this
monitors product page stating it is
capable of a one millisecond MP RT smart
response time MP RT is just a fancy
acronym for black frame insertion which
is a technique that artificially boosts
the apparent clarity of the image
through strobing the backlight it's a
bit of a cheat or trick and due to the
strobing backlight and brightness
reduction most people choose to game
with the MPR team mode disabled which is
actually the default mode anyway the
actual response time for a VA panel are
much higher than one millisecond which
is why companies tend to opt for dodgy
metrics like MP RT to make their
response time claims that seem more
impressive as you can see from the
charts here the reality is the c-27j one
has a true response time of nine point
six one milliseconds using a greater
great average that's not exactly blazing
fast but it is within a typical range
for VI panels and considering this is on
the budget end of the scale I think it's
a respectable enough result
I should note I'm using the medium
overdrive setting here the high setting
introduced overshoot so we opted not to
use it
I think AOC probably could have tweaked
their algorithm to deliver around that 8
millisecond transition time we usually
see from VA panels but we're not far off
and the black white black transition
time of 16 point one milliseconds is
again very close to what we typically
see from VA displays however of course
the key things note here is the average
transition time for this monitor falls
outside the Refresh window this is a 144
Hertz panel so the image is updated
every six point nine four milliseconds
however transitions take nine point six
one milliseconds on average with the
fastest transitions around the 5
millisecond mark when transitions take
longer than the Refresh window you're
not getting a true 144 Hertz experience
instead the level of smearing and
overall clarity of this panel is going
to be a bit closer to a 100 Hertz
display that's a bit disappointing when
many people will be buying this monitor
for its 144 Hertz capabilities input lag
is decent at around 11 milliseconds it's
not the absolute fastest in this metric
but other budget displays were tested
like the Acer k g2 v 1q F and vo-tech NB
24c are slower the combined input lag
and response time figure is pretty
average though just to be expected of a
$280 product the ARCC 2071 isn't the
brightest monitor going around and a
touch over 220 in its peak which won't
make it suitable for those in super
bright environments that need high
brightness levels however for gamers in
typical indoor environments it should be
fine a contrast ratio of around 3000 won
is also spot-on with what a OC claims
and what's normal for a VA display
however out of the box color calibration
is very strange to put it nicely default
white balance is way off the mark at a
very warm 52 47 K which gives their
display a noticeable orange tone the
average CCT graph shows just how crazy
the color temperature is across the
grayscale range which leads to a poor
Delta e of 5.45 gamma is also on the low
side it's a shame that the C 27g one
comes configured like this because as
you can see in the saturation chart this
monitor has near full srgb coverage and
quite good saturation sweeps except
everything is just skewed due to
incorrect white balance which leads to
an average Delta II of four point six
four it's also a similar story with
color checker I really have no idea why
the c-27j one ships like this whether it
was an error with my panel or something
else that's gone wrong however I can say
there with a few simple OSD tweaks
particularly to the user color sliders
it's pretty easy to fix in fact all you
need to do at least for my unit was to
bring down the red slider a few notches
this simple adjustment basically fixes
the issue and completely transforms how
the monitor performs with this change
the c-27j one is much better than its
factory state it's still not perfect but
Delta is have reduced to a 1.41 average
and the CCT average curve is far better
unfortunately there was no easy fix to
the low gamma despite the USD including
a gamma setting but will be able to fix
that through a full calibration and with
a largely corrected white balance the
c-27j one produces a saturation Delta a
average blow to pointer and a color
checker Delta a average just above 2.0
again I wouldn't say these results are
completely suitable for professional
work but a gaming display with adult
eight around or below 2.0 is pretty much
what I'm after
how does the diss
My Fair was a full calibration using
spectra cows cow man five pretty well as
expected with a perfect gamma and CC T
curve along with a grayscale Delta e
below 0.3 which is fantastic saturation
and color checker results again aren't
perfect but still decent enough for most
users when calibrated overall this is a
good result from a budget display and I
should mention as well that calibrating
this panel actually improves contrast to
thirty three twenty five to one so I
guess it ships in such a bad state that
nearly everything is fixed with a few
small tweaks in terms of uniformity this
is usually an area where curve display
struggle however the c-27j one is
actually decent in this regard with most
of the screen delivering a Delta II
deviants under 2.0 relative to the
center sure some parts particularly top
corners are a little off this sort of
performance is common for flat panels so
to get it from a curve display gives me
hope that uniformity is improving with
newer curved models alright so that's
all the testing done for the OCC 27 g1
the question now is whether you should
buy this monitor
I guess I'm assuming here that most
people don't want to display like this
interested in the 27-inch size
specifically because if you just want
something high refresh I'd recommend
spending as little as $200 on a 24 inch
monitor instead but at 27 inches
specifically the only monitors you'll
find cheaper than this flat tee and
equivalents and depending on your region
they may not even be cheaper anyway in
the US the ASA that kg 271 is around $25
cheaper but in Australia it's more
expensive and of course then we're
looking at the difference between ATM
monitor and VA and I suspect most people
who prefer the VA due to its much better
color quality even if it's curved but I
do have a few concerns with the AOC
c-27j one that prevent it from being an
instant recommendation response times
aren't amazing that keeps the budget
panel from delivering true 144 Hertz
you'll still get a decent enough high
refresh experience but a quicker TN does
provide more clarity out of the box
calibration is also very poor it can be
fixed through some simple tweaks but the
default settings are a bit bizarre after
you fix the color issues though the
c-27j one does have some great things
going for it in particular its height
adjustable stand that many budget
monitors don't offer and a very good
uniformity for a curved display contrast
ratio and color coil also quite good
after you fix the initial issues and
that fix is pretty simple of course the
price is also very attract
as well children $80 is a good amount to
pay for our US viewers but in Australia
and I believe Europe as well AOC is once
again delivering excellent value with
this monitor it won't blow your socks
off but considering the price I think
it's a good buy for gamers that are
after a 27-inch high refresh monitor
without breaking the bank that's it for
this oh C Mon ative review I've got a
few other monitors to test in the next
few weeks so stay tuned for that
