we released our core I $9.99 oh okay a
review and sided thermals as being a
pretty major issue for the new 8 core
CPU in fact familes was so bad I was
worried I'd done something wrong but
prior to release fellow other youtubers
Brian from Czechia city and Jarod of
Jared's Tech confirmed the horrendous
thermal results then about 20 minutes
before the NDA lifted overclocking God
devourer confirmed what we'd all found
once all the reviews will live I then
jumped around all over the place checked
out what other media outlets were
reporting however the most part it
looked pretty hot there were however a
few outliers OC 3d TV being one they
reported shockingly low operating
temperatures up to 65 degrees and then
when overclocked just 79 degrees both
were lower than my stock temperature
this didn't make sense until I dug into
the system specs and discovered the
issue an issue I actually touched on in
my own review though not in relation to
power consumption and thermals anyway I
had no intention of addressing the
results despite a few people requesting
that we did in the comments section on
various social media platforms that were
on and whatnot the review police and
chances are they're being harassed by
quite a few viewers so they'll probably
look into themselves so that was that
but then the following day our discord
chat blew up quite a few members who
subscribe to floatplane and that's the
lioness tech tips early access platform
we're ranting about there 9900 k review
our long story short linus was claiming
that the peak load temperature was just
58 degrees for the 9900 k and the total
system consumption was just 139 watts
now both these figures are absurdly low
and despite countless viewers pointing
that out Linus's stabbed his foot down
and declares that he stands by them
unfortunately though they do fail the
common sense test more than once and
despite being technically correct this
should have set off alarm bells I know
that statement contradicts itself but
bear with me his own results show the
eight core 19900 K running cooler and
consuming less power than these six core
8700
okay the 8-core model of course packs
33% more cores and is also clocked
higher and it still uses the same 14
nanometer process so it should be
impossible for the 9900 k to use the
same amount of power as the 8700 K let
alone less
so at this point you're probably
thinking okay Linus got it wrong here
his team messed up well no not exactly
Linus address to viewer concerns in a
pinned comment saying the following the
performance numbers we got were double
checked against intel's engineers and
they are in line this suggests that our
thermal tests are indicative of stock
performance with motherboard vendor
optimizations disabled the crazy part
being that this is actually correct all
their performance numbers are
technically correct we could argue that
as a more correct but technically new
the harbor on box nor Linus tech tips
got it wrong despite publishing vastly
different numbers intel's hell-bent on
declaring the 1900 k as a 95 watt part
which is ridiculous and it's the reason
why our results differed so much to
those published by Linus tech tips we
used two motherboards to validate the 99
0 k numbers the MSI z3 90 godlike and
the as Roxanne 390 Taichi ultimate both
boards are more than capable of
extracting every last bit of performance
from the 8 core processor Linus like OSI
3d TV used a motherboard packing a
measly 4 phase VRM a verum that's not
nearly capable enough of getting the
most of the 9900 K but I should note
does officially support the 8 core
processor so there is no reason why they
can't test with such a motherboard in
our day 1 review we compared the Zed 390
godlike to a Zed 370 board using a
fourth phase vrm the same design used by
most entry levels at 390 boards and this
is the reason why we used it and when
doing so we saw a very heavy vrm
throttling which reduced the clock speed
and therefore performance what we didn't
show was thermal and power consumption
numbers when throttling so I've gone
back and retested the MSI z3 70 PC Pro
now this isn't the same board used by
either Linus tech tips or OSI 3d TV but
it does pack a four
Fay's vrm and crucially has the same 95
watt limit i've also dumped my open-loop
cooling setup with the three hundred and
sixty millimeter radiator in favor of
the corsair h 100 i program previously
we saw a stock operating temperature of
85 degrees with the h 100 i but now with
the 95 watt limit in place the
temperature only peaked at 60 degrees
before dropping down and holding steady
at 55 degrees right in the range of the
58 degrees linus reports power
consumption also dropped from 249 watts
right down to 160 watts a little more
than what linus reported but then we are
using a different board memory power
supply and so on point is that's a 36%
reduction in power consumption now you
might think well that's great
the four phase board will add the ninety
nine hundred K to run much cooler and
consume less power
sounds like a win to me however it's
only doing this because it's limiting
the ninety nine hundred case clock speed
whereas in our review at maintain an all
core clock speed of 4.7 gigahertz with
the 95 watt limit in place it ran all
course at just four point two gigahertz
now Intel will be quick to point out the
base clock is 3.6 yigit's so we're still
within spec but with the limits removed
the 9900 K does target a times forty
seven o'clock multiplier for a four
point seven gigahertz operating
frequency linus also reported the 99er
EK is having issues with DirectX 12 in
games which is on as we saw no such
issue and while that would just be odd
in general however linus was led to
believe this as the DirectX 12 API
better utilizes the 99er case eight
cores placing it under more load and
therefore forcing the clock speed down
this is why the 8700 K was slower than
the 99 okay using DirectX 11 but faster
using DirectX 12 they witnessed this in
Deus Ex mankind divided and shadow of
the Tomb Raider if you recall I
mentioned in my day 1 review the four
phase board would allow the 9900 k2 hit
1900 points on the first Cinebench run
and guess what lioness reported 1911
points and that's 7 percent lower than
our score however if you run the test at
least three more times back-to-back the
score will drop down to
under 1800 points or at least that's
what we saw and that's a 13% decrease
and that makes sense as the 99th okay is
running at least 11 percent slower in
terms of frequency so mystery solved and
technically the Linus tech tips numbers
are correct as the Intel spec is very
broad now so we're not calling Linus up
we're not saying they did anything wrong
as technically they didn't for those of
you wondering the 1900 order for it to
maintain 4.7 gigahertz the all core
frequency the 95 watt limit needs to be
raised to 150 watts and that's a 58%
increase so that means boards aspect to
only handle 95 watts are running
massively out of spec in order to get
the most out of the 8 core processor it
also means if you're going to run the
9900 K at the maximum spec like we did
then you are going to need a serious
cooler and even then expect things to
get pretty hot anyway I hope that clears
things up and explains why our results
were so different to those who used
boards with the 95 watt limit in place
and with that I am going to end this one
