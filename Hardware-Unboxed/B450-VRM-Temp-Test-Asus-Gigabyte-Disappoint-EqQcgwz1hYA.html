AMD has officially released their be 450
chipset and as of today you can now at
long last by a be 450 motherboard some
retailers such as Newegg did jump the
gun last week and start selling early so
some of you may already have a be 450
board but for those of you who don't we
have some pretty useful buying advice
that will be presented in this video so
make sure you stick around for all of
that on hand for testing I have 5b 450
motherboards from brands such as MSI as
rocker soos and Giga Byte I'll quickly
go over each board before discussing
what we're actually testing in today's
video and then of course we'll get into
those results from MSI we have the
impressive-looking be 450 tog which we
featured in this bill just a few days
here on the channel so if you missed
that check it out anyway the tomahawk
from the B 350 series was their best
seller so MSI have pretty high
expectations for the B 450 tomahawk and
they've done a few things that should
help improve sales like make a more
neutral theme so it's a black gray theme
should go with just about any build but
their improvements have extended just
beyond the aesthetics although we get
the same 4+2 verum and the ATX form
factor the vm cooling has been upgraded
the heat sinks are physically large and
feature more fins for significantly more
surface area MSI is also decided not to
advertise the board's varium
configuration which I suppose is
preferable to lying and I really
appreciate how they haven't added any
additional chokes to try and give the
appearance of packing more phases than
it really does those of you wondering
MSI is using the rich tech RT 88-90 for
a controller with two on semiconductor
for C 0 24 and MOSFETs for the higher
side and 2 for C 0 29 n MOSFETs for the
low side MSI's added an extra PCIe times
a 1 gen 3 slot and removed the legacy
PCI slots so in my opinion that's a
pretty good move a pair of USB 3.1 gen2
ports have been added to the rear i/o
and the board now packs six SATA ports
rather than just four there's also an
extra RGB head of supporting a wider
range of colors and effects then finally
one of the most
conclusions is the new bias flashback
feature which is said to be included on
all MSI be 450 motherboards this button
which is found on the i/o panel allows
you to upgrade the board's bios and all
it requires is ATX power a very handy
feature for future of rise and cpu
support for those buying this board
without an older CPU to first boot it up
and then flash the BIOS the be 350
tomahawk is currently selling for $100
u.s. while the be 450 version is coming
in at 110 dollars u.s. but we expect it
to replace the be 350 version at $100 us
shortly overall a really nice beef 450
motherboard from MSI then from asrock we
have the B 450 gaming k4 and B 450
gaming ITX AC starting with the gaming
k4 which is this board here it's
basically a refresh of the B 350 K 4 it
was the a be 350 gaming k4 but yeah very
little has changed there in fact other
than the chipset the only other
noteworthy change is the design like MSI
asrock has gone with a more neutral
theme as you can see it's another black
gray board so they've just dropped the
red highlights from the previous version
unfortunately this means we have the
same vrm design marketed as a digi power
9 phase design with premium power chokes
which I have to say don't look that
premium at all if I'm honest however
it's not the choke quality that's the
issue here rather it's how many of them
there are as rocks included six chokes
on the vehicle of erm and yet we really
only have a 3-phase vrm designed to look
like a six phase verum and what it
really isn't is a nine phase vrm there's
no double here either it's just a
doubling of components so it's a three
plus three phase very I'm using an
Intersil is l9 five seven one two
controller with Nicko is PK six one
eight eight a MOSFETs on the high side
and Nikko's P's at zero nine zero three
BK MOSFETs on the low side the SOC
configuration is similar though here we
only get a single higher side MOSFET so
it's quite disingenuous to advertise as
motherboard is having a nine phase verum
when it only has three phases for the
vcore they've also done the same thing
with the B 450 gaming ITX AC this is
advertised
is having an eight phase-- varium when
in reality it's a three plus two so five
phases in total the board also lacks
cooling on the SOC vrm so not sure how
well it'll go through Raven Ridge APU
the focus of today's video that I will
be on these second gen rising CPUs but
the APU is something that I can come
back and retest with the B 450 boards
later
so the B 450 gaming k4 is coming in at
100 dollars us which is also $10 a US
over the current asking price for the be
350 version and then the B 450 gaming
ITX AC is coming in at $130 us which was
the original asking price of the be 350
equivalent overall no real upgrades from
asrock which is a bit disappointing from
a soos we have the ROG Strix B 450f
gaming the company's most premium B 450
motherboard at 130 dollars us so
certainly up there in terms of pricing
when compared to the be 350 version you
get USB type-c you also get an extra m2
slot and a pre-installed IO shield
however for some reason they've also
added a big plastic shroud over the i/o
area which unfortunately extends over
the vcore verum heatsink blocking
much-needed airflow I know why they've
done this it's a cheap addition to the
board that makes it appear more high-end
than it really is and they've also been
had to add a neat little RGB logo as
well while it does look quite nice it
really is a gimmick and I feel that it
will hurt the board's their more
performance something we will look into
soon before we get to that though the
last board we have on hand for testing
is the gigabyte be 450 horas pro or
Wi-Fi and on the surface it looks like
ye but has really up to their game for
the new B 450 range and I suppose in
some ways they have but in some ways
they haven't the 8+3 phase very
marketing scam has been abandoned now
and it's just called a hybrid digital
PWM which I suppose is fine however like
asrock gigabyte has gone with a choke
heavy approach in an effort to fool
buyers into thinking that it's a more
premium board than it really is on board
you'll count no less than eleven chokes
so pretty impressive stuff or is it this
isn't the beefy verum that appears to be
on the surface
despite packing what looks like a Levin
phase
it's really just a four plus three phase
very amusing the intersil is l9 five
seven one two controller however unlike
the MSI board for example each phase
only has a single high side MOSFET with
two low side FETs then the three phase
SOC verum only employs a single high
side FET and a single low side FET both
the V Corps and SOC of erm do feature
passive cooling so that's something
though the heat sinks aren't
particularly impressive and like a sous
gigabyte found it necessary to limit
airflow over the V corvara heatsink with
an unnecessarily large plastic shroud
despite that though the rest of the
board does look very good even at the
120 dollar u.s. price point you get
Intel dual band 802 11 AC Wi-Fi and
Bluetooth 4.2 joule m dot 2 slots ALC
1220 VB enhanced audio with wim a audio
Capps Intel Gigabit LAN six SATA ports
plenty of PCI Express expansion and a
nice-looking integrated IO shield so
overall a nice looking board I'm just a
little concerned about how that verum is
going to perform and we will look at
that now for this video I'm going to
focus solely on vrm temperatures and
power draw in total I've tested three
hardware configurations using the rise
in seven 2700 X and it's stock out of
the box form either your isin v 2600
overclock to 4.2 gigahertz using one
point four volts and then the horizon 7
2700 again at 4.2 gigahertz using one
point four volts
i've then tested all three
configurations under two different
conditions firstly on an open testbed
with no direct airflow using a
closed-loop cooler and that would be I
suppose somewhat of a worst case
scenario that will rival a case with
pretty poor airflow then for the best
case scenario I've tested inside the msi
pylon using my case modification
demonstrated in the build video from a
few days ago I call this a best case
scenario as we are using a well
ventilated case with direct airflow over
the v RM in a room with an ambient air
temperature of just 21 degrees now
depending on which configuration worked
best i've used either a rear or top
mounted intake fan blowing air over the
motherboards v RM in fact it was only
the asrock be 450 dam in k4 that worked
better with a rear mounted fan the rest
preferred the fan mounted in the top of
the case for stress testing I'm not
using a power bug type
like prime95 ain't nothing against using
that kind of software that certainly has
its place but for this test I wanted to
use a real-world workload so I went with
a blender workload that takes the rise
in seven twenty seven hundred well over
an hour to complete the load results are
reported after an hour of running the
blender workload and then the idle is
taken after a ten minute cooldown period
to record the temperatures I'm using a
digital thermometer with k-type
thermocouple x' i've placed one directly
on top of a high side MOSFET and then
the other on the low side so i'm
measuring the temperature directly from
on top of the component between it and a
thermal pad and not an internal
temperature which is bound to be a
little higher oh and I will be reporting
the highest temperature of the two
probes and I should just point out that
all boards have been tested under the
exact same conditions so this will give
us a clearer picture of how the verum
temperatures compare from one board to
another I think that's about everything
let's get to the results first up we
have the passive results here each board
was tested on open testbed with no
direct airflow basically we're relying
on whatever air circulation there is in
the room install is the Rison 720 700 X
with the deep cool Castle 240 so even
the CPU cooler isn't directing any
airflow over the VM heat sinks as a
result things get pretty hot with the
eight core 16 thread CPU installed
there's our B 450 gaming K for an MSI be
450 tomahawk are these standouts here
keeping very room temperatures below 90
degrees after an hour long blender
stress test anything over 100 degrees we
deem is unacceptable and we see the
asrock be 450 gaming ITX AC and a seuss
ROG Strix be 450 F gaming pushing past
this the gigabyte be 450 or s pro Wi-Fi
pushed well past that threshold hitting
an incredible 121 degrees and the
blender workload did crash multiple
times but I'll talk more about that
towards the end of the video for now
let's add a 120 millimeter fan to either
the rear or top of the case to direct a
bit of air flow towards the vehicle
veeram heatsink now for these results
please note all motherboards except for
the asrock p450 gaming k4 had the 120
millimeter fan installed in the top of
the MSI pylon case directing air flow
over the vrm the gaming k4 ran
considerably cooler with a rear-mounted
take fan as you can see despite being
now installed inside an ATX case the
temperatures are greatly improved thanks
to the drastically increased airflow
over the verum heat sinks the MSI B 450
tomahawk was the biggest winner here
dropping down to just 52 degrees
the asrock p450 gaming k4 also did well
providing sub 60 degree temperatures the
rest of the boards were now acceptable
and even the Gigabyte B 450 or s pro
Wi-Fi manage to stay under 70 degrees
after an hour-long stress test the
gigabyte board was also no longer
crashing here's a quick look at total
system power draw from the wall and
interestingly the gigabyte masseuse
boards drew the least amount of power
despite being the hottest operating
boards a soos also heavily dropped CPU
voltage when the system is completely at
idle which is why we see a noticeably
lower idle consumption for the B 450 F
gaming then finally with the rise in 720
700 X we have the peak consumption
results for the CPU as reported by
hardware info again we see the gigabyte
be 450 or s pro Wi-Fi asrock p 450
gaming ITX AC and a soos ROG Strix B 450
F gaming all appearing to be the most
efficient boards however what this
really means is that they have the most
severe voltage drop under load the
gigabyte board dropped 13% lower than
that of the MSI B 450 tomahawk and this
could possibly explain why I was seeing
instability issues without verum cooling
next up I've gone with what might be a
more realistic high-end configuration
for most B 450 motherboards horizon 5
2600 overclocked for this test we have
an all core overclock of 4.2 gigahertz
using one point four volts and again I'm
starting with the passive results on the
open air test bench temperatures are
slightly lower than what we saw with the
stock 2700 X and this was to be expected
as we found in our day 1 reviewed that
the overclocked 2600 X consumed roughly
the same amount of power as the stock
2700 X in the blender workload that
being the case the performance trends
are all very similar to what we found
previously with the 8 core CPU again I
should point out the gigabyte board did
crash a few times during this test and
when forced to rerun for a third time it
ended up running into the dreaded blue
screen of death I'm not sure if this is
related to the VM or not it could be
some other issue with our particular
board but
now it's quite clear this board does
have the worst-performing verum of all
the be 450 boards we have on hand with
the be 450 boards installed in the ATX
case with direct airflow over the verum
we see temperatures again drop
significantly and there are a few
degrees cooler than what we saw in
testing with the stock 2700 X power
consumption is also slightly lower but
we do see an even bigger drop-off for
the gigabyte a seuss and asrock p450
gaming ITX AC when overclocked I should
point out that the gigabyte board
doesn't offer fixed voltages so I
couldn't set it to 1 point 4 volt like
the other boards and there's also no LLC
options the only option is to offset the
voltage which can be maxed out at plus
0.2 volts looking at the CPU power
drawer and hardware info we again see
that the gigabyte be 450 or s pro Wi-Fi
is feeding the processor considerably
less power than the other boards tested
potentially causing our stability issues
finally we have the ultimate test the
horizon 7 2700 overclocked to 4.2
gigahertz using one point 4 volts for
this configuration I'm skipping the
passive testing as I wasn't really that
keen on risking my CPU or power supply
as you can see even with direct airflow
the Gigabyte be 450 or s pro Wi-Fi hit
98 degrees under load without airflow
it's not going to end well especially if
we kept pushing it DUSU rog Strix b 450f
gaming also exceeded 81 degrees which is
certainly getting up there and then we
have a Xerox Mini ITX board and the B
450 gaming ITX probably won't be
afforded the kind of airflow it is in
this ATX case as it would be in your
typical Mini ITX case so although it
only picked at seventy-five degrees this
is likely going to be a best case
scenario and it will get much hotter in
pretty much all mini ITX enclosures the
asrock p450 gaming k4 on the other hand
did very well as did the MSI B 450
tomahawk both performed exceptionally
well showing no signs of stability
issues at all interestingly this time
the power drive is very similar across
all tested boards despite using the
exact same voltages seen previously with
the 2600 that said hardware info does
report slightly lower CPU power draw for
the Gigabyte B 450 or s pro Wi-Fi but
again not nearly as Extreme as what we
saw previously okay so that was a lot of
VR
temperature related information took
quite a few days to acquire but now that
we have it all what do we make of it
and there are quite a few things to keep
in mind when considering all this data
firstly it is based on a real-world
workload opposed to a power bug type
program like prime95 which I did run on
each of these boards just to check for
stability and I saw on average power
consumption increase by about 10 percent
in fact using the overclocked Verizon
727 configuration I left each of these
motherboards running prime95 overnight
with active cooling so the
120-millimeter fan directing air over
the VRMs and all of the boards did
survive that test except for the
gigabyte board which suffered a dreaded
blue screen of death again at this point
it's not clear what the cause of the
instability is I possibly have a bad
board or perhaps it is just a verum
thermal issue the information we've
gathered so far certainly seems to
suggest that that is the issue but I'm
keen to see what others report so I will
be on the lookout for that
anyway I'm aware that most of you
probably aren't looking at a be 450
board for running blender workloads or
prime95 overnight though some of you
might be I suspect most of you watching
this video gamers and really all you
care about is gaming performance if you
are just a gamer and all you do is game
than these vrm temps almost meaningless
at this point in time anyway because
neither the horizon 520 600 northern 720
700 I worked anywhere near hard enough
in today's games to see the sort of
temperatures that we did with our
blender workload of course it doesn't
have to be blender it could be any core
heavy application that runs for an
extended period of time and that will
push VM temperatures up there and these
results also speak to the quality of the
board and if you're overclocking it's
also important information to be well
aware of so if you do intend on running
core heavy applications then make sure
you pay attention to the veeram thermals
and given our findings I can strongly
recommend either the MSI B 450 torque or
the as rock B 450 gaming k4 on paper the
MSI board does appear to have the best
verum design and that was certainly the
case when testing oh and they're big
heat sinks probably don't hurt either
despite only packing a 3-phase v core
veeram the asrock be 450 gaming k4 made
Seuss ROG Strix B 450f gaming and
gigabyte be 450 or s pro Wi-Fi look a
bit silly it has to be said
the asrock board has these nice finned
heat sinks so great for increasing the
surface area there and basically cooling
down as air flows through them whereas
both the a gigabyte and a soos boards
just have big old chunks of aluminium
which are great for extracting heat from
the MOSFETs not really great at then
getting rid of the heat so they're kind
of like big heat reservoirs and then I
say making matters even worse is the
fact that we have this big plastic
shroud on both of the boards the soos
one in particular yet does limit air
flow quite substantially even little
asrock p450 gaming ITX AC with its
lightweight verum showed no signs of
failing during any of our extended load
testing there was no stability issues or
anything like that to speak of are still
having said all that I do need to go
back and test it with an overclocked
horizon 5 2500 G to see how the apu goes
with that to face passively cooled SOC
vrm based on what I've seen so far MSI
hands-down has the best value B 450
board on offer with their tomahawk model
and before you claim that I'm an MSI
shell or fanboy or whatever else I urge
you to take a look at my recent top 5
best X 470 video where I didn't name a
single MSI X 470 motherboard and my
opinion MSI really has stepped up their
game for this B 450 release and their B
450 gaming Pro carbon a/c looks to be a
particularly impressive b4 few
motherboard so I would like to check
that out soon hopefully I can get my
hands on it let you guys know how good
that board is later in the week I will
be comparing the performance of the be
350 and B 450 chipsets expect that to be
a rather uninteresting video but I know
heaps of you will be interested in
seeing of those results I will provide
them and then after that I will do as
sort of a be full 50 roundup where I
name what I believe to be the best of
value B for 50 motherboards and there'll
be a few different categories their best
mini ITX I think it might only be two of
those anyway we'll cover that later on
in the week and then hopefully by the
time you're watching this someone
we'll have tested the Auris pro board so
we'll know if I have a defective board
or if they're all as underwhelming as
this one which would be unfortunate if
they are but maybe that's the situation
and that yeah really is going to do it
for this one
