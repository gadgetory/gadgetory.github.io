just about to check my bag in the car
i'm heading to nvidia's a pack 1080
launch press event so should be pretty
interesting
hey guys just got to the hotel in Sydney
foreign videos 1080 media briefing and I
really have anything to bring all my
stuff in on my gear so I was lucky
enough to get this battle dragon
backpack from thermaltake so I thought
I'd just take you guys through it now as
you can see you actually access the main
compartment by unzipping is huge red
side zip and inside you can fit a lot of
stuff so I've got my camera flash and
camera here bunch of clothes jeans
underwear shoes t shirts shirts and you
can actually can sort of customize which
bits are sectioned off it's actually
designed really so you can take it to
lands you can stick you know your
keyboard in here now if you probably fit
a small screen in there as you can see
I've got actually two laptops in here on
the front it's quite a few compartments
as well so there's a small one here and
cram some stuff in there it's got my
keys and stuff in there bigger one here
got some toiletries there's also a
pretty sturdy handle on the front dan
yeah there's another small compartment
on the front and then quite a sizable
one as well and in here I've got thermal
takes just announced level 10 m advanced
RGB mouth so me pulling that out and
giving that a crack on this trip as well
so yeah that's the battle dragon
backpack it's pretty big pretty nifty
you can also you can carry it either as
a backpack or you can pull this back
down and then there's like a shoulder
strap as well so that's the battle
dragon backpack through one
here we are at the park royal just
waiting for the event to start
I
now here what we try to do is try to
instil you I on the left hand side here
and what that is first you'll go to the
pasta game second is now we have free
camera control so I can pretty much go
where but just to give you guys an idea
of say a really high one high resolution
when this is a link business 15 X takes
a little edgy and this is 15 X and
you'll notice that you can really just
zoom in a whole lot and this goes into
the LOD aspect right you get to see all
the details are you zooming forever and
this also gives you print call the whole
idea is to increase realism so that
you're also increasing number
well I just one of those Devils were
very ethical jam packed a lot of stuff
and do it so that you get a real
interesting gaming experience there we
put a lot of time and effort into this
demo yeah like Nick just said right we
have a lot of great technologies a lot
of great efficiency this product with
the 1080 but you know basics are you
have to have great graphics there's
still the view basically like you're
looking at the window or three windows
in this is an area and how we do this is
basically we split each screen into an
individual viewport and we can render
based on how its curving this or that
did since we're curving it so that it
matches the lens delete all this blends
matched shade so when we're able to use
single pass stereo that means we're
broadcasting the same geometry both eyes
at the same time we're able to increase
the performance by about fifty percent
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
