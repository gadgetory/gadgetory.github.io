recently we've been getting back into a
bit of external GPU coverage and the one
product that caught my eye is the new
razor core v2 as it's one of the more
well-known a GPUs on the market
razor heavily market this product
alongside their blade stealth laptop is
the perfect solution for transforming
the slim and light machine into a proper
gaming system but does it actually work
as advertised and is it the best option
on the market let's find out
so like its predecessor the razor core
v2 is an empty external graphics
enclosure in other words you'll need to
purchase a graphics card separately this
is a bit different to the orison gaming
boxes we've talked about on the channel
previously which included their own GPUs
however the court vetoes no installed GP
approach does allow you to buy whatever
GPU fits within your budget or you could
even install a spare graphics card you
have lying around the core v2 attaches
to laptops via Thunderbolt 3 just like
most a GPUs and it's not just restricted
to raise the laptops
despite the advertising on their website
the core v2 does work with most
Thunderbolt 3 equipped laptops provided
a GPU support is enabled those with
Razer laptops can take comfort that any
modern razor laptop with Thunderbolt 3
is known to work as this is a new
version let's go through the differences
between the razor core v2 and its
predecessor that launched a few years
back the key change is the move to a
dual Thunderbolt 3 controller which sees
the PCIe slot through the graphics card
attached to one controller while the USB
ports and Ethernet jack get a separate
controller both controllers do
eventually funnel down into the one
Thunderbolt 3 stream and cable Moroso
claims the dual controller setup allows
everything to function more reliably
than they did in the past the internals
of the case have also been redesigned
such that the core v2 is now compatible
with a larger range of graphics cards
literally the GPU area is more than a
centimeter taller than in the previous
core and can now accommodate any GPU
that's less than 14 point five
centimeters tall four point three
centimeters wide
and 30 centimeters long I'll talk a bit
more about the GPU installation process
in a moment as the core v2 is designed
to fit most graphics cards on the market
the unit itself is quite large at least
in comparison to the compact horas
gaming boxes it's not the biggest a GPU
enclosure I've seen but it Dwarfs the
gaming box in both size and weight this
is an enclosure you'll want to keep on
your desk
while the gaming box could easily be
transported around if maybe the bill
call it like the first iteration remains
outstanding and in line with the metal
chassis
Razer uses for their laptops the largest
section of the exterior is a single
piece of machined powder coated metal
and it's complemented well by large fins
and vents along most edges the seamless
integration of these necessary cooling
components gives it that premium finish
you'd expect from a razer product as far
as fans are concerned that are a couple
included along the bottom edge drawing
air from a gap along the bottom and
providing cool air to the power supply
and graphics card the GPU also gets a
large vent along inside which makes the
core suitable for both blower and
open-air GPU coolers did I mention the
core v2 has RGB lighting well of course
it wouldn't be a razer product without
it and there's an RGB LED strip
illuminating the graphics card on the
side along with another strip at the
front for some sneaky highlights towards
otherwise a stealthy front panel port
wise the core v2 does come with
Thunderbolt 3 for connecting to your
laptop or other device of choice along
with a four port USB 3.0 hub and Gigabit
Ethernet considering a lot of ultra
portables simply don't have the space
for Wired networking it's nice to get an
Ethernet port on the core installing a
graphics card is ridiculously easy with
the new design of the Cauvery 2 and is
completely toolless simply flip out the
handle on the back and slide out the
interior section from there remove the
port cover slot in the GPU attach the
power cables there's support for up to
two eight pin cables and screw in the
GPU using the thumb screw then you just
slide the interior back inside flip back
the handle and it's good to go the GPU
is also very easy to remove thanks to a
large leave of racer is included just
under the power supply
speaking of the psu the unit he is rated
for 500 watts and razor with support for
up to 375 watts of GPU power
theoretically you could use a monstrous
power sucking jewel chip you cut in here
like the AMD Radeon Pro duo though you
would be much better off with a good
single GPU card instead of the e GPUs
I've used this is the most elegant and
easy way to slot in a graphics card and
even the internal layout is great enough
about the design and features let's talk
a performance as you can install any
graphics card you like I am going to
leave a gaming performance to the very
end there are a couple of other things I
want to talk about first I was most
curious about the dual Thunderbolt 3
controller in the core v2 I did have
some problems hooking up USB peripherals
reliably to the Auris gaming boxes on
some laptops though I can say I've had
no such issues with the core v2 which is
good news as they did switch to the dual
controls specifically to address the
problem however the use of dual
controllers it doesn't increase the
bandwidth available to the GPU through
the Thunderbolt 3 cable whether the USB
ports are utilized or not the GPU is
still limited to pcie 3.0 x 4 which is a
thirty two gigabit per second protocol
and then further reduce by Thunderbolt
threes overhead and limitations to
around 20 to 22 gigabit per second in my
testing there was no real-world
difference in GPU bandwidth or
performance between the dual controller
core v2 and what I believe is the single
controller or ass gaming box even while
performing a file copy from an SSD
attached to the a GPU the situation with
both boxes is the GPU bandwidth is
reduced if you use any of the USB ports
or Ethernet functionality
well the dual controllers appear to
solve is bandwidth allocation on the GPU
itself ensuring enough room is given for
USB devices and so forth before the data
is sent through the Thunderbolt 3 cable
crucially it appears these decisions
occur at lower latency such that
peripherals support is much better and
that's really the advantage to the
design there as for thermals and noise
levels this is almost entirely
determined by the GPU you
to use the additional fans in the core
v2 are going to be quieter than the GPU
found while gaming in almost every case
and of course the GPU is also the main
source of heat at idle the razor core v2
isn't super quiet with the silent GPU
installed the Auris gaming box is
quieter but it's not going to burn your
ears out either and you could just
unplug it while you're not using it
which does shut off the unit entirely so
I've left gaming performance to the end
because this is entirely determined by
the graphics card you choose to use with
the core v2 here I've tested with an
nvidia geforce gtx 1066 gigabyte as it's
one of the most popular GPUs on the
market and will likely be a popular
choice for those buying a razor core v2
as there's no inherent performance
difference among each GPUs if you're
interested in GT X 1080 performance
check our coverage of the Auris GT
externally gaming box I did hook up the
core v2 to the razor blade stealth with
the core i7
8550 you inside which I also use for
testing the horas gaming box I'll be
going into more detail on the eye 78552
plus GTX 1060 EGP combo in a separate
video but the basic gist is the combo is
well suited to 1080p gaming though not
always at the maximum detail levels
stuttering is an issue in some games due
to the Thunderbolt 3 bandwidth
limitations but most games run well
provided you choose the settings to suit
the hardware this combo does clocking
20% slower than a true GTX 1060 gaming
laptop on average due to a range of
bottlenecks though oddly you can eke out
more performance by slow lenient or
faster GPU something like the GTX 1080
is going to be 33% faster than gtx 1060
EGP combo we tested with this is a
strange result and does suggest latency
is the main cause of slowdowns with a
GPUs but we'll have to do some more
benchmarking to understand the
bottlenecks in a bit more detail in
general though if you have an
ultraportable laptop with that a gaming
capable GPU
something like the Razer core v2 will
significantly improve the gaming
performance and actually make games
playable in almost all cases even if you
don't get the full performance of the
GPU you choose to put in the core the
performance you will
get is world's better than having no GPU
at all so for most of this video I've
been pretty positive about the core v2
you know it's a well-made box it works
as advertised and in the case of USB
peripherals even better than other GPUs
and it supports a wide range of GPUs but
the absolute killer and the reason I
simply can't recommend the e GPU
enclosure here is the price tag Razer is
charging 500 US dollars for this
enclosure without a GPU installed which
is quite frankly ludicrous assume
graphics cards were available at their
MSRP which does seem crazy right now but
bear with me I've raised a core v2 with
the gtx 1060 would cost you seven
hundred and fifty dollars gigabytes or
gtx 1080 gaming box has an MSRP of 700
bucks and includes a gtx 1080 both a
GPUs work with Razer laptops yet the
Auris offering provides 33% more
performance for $50 less or of course
you could get the gtx 1070 gaming box
which retails for $600 just a hundred
bucks more than the Razer Calvary 2 yet
it includes a full gtx 1070 of course
right now the Auris gaming boxes are a
bit hard to find with the GPU shortage
in full swing but even then you can get
other Thunderbolt 3 GPU enclosures from
roughly half the price of the Razer core
v2 this icky geo node unit doesn't look
as nice as the core v2 from a build
quality perspective but the 230 dollars
you save could go directly to a better
GPU it just makes it so hard to
recommend a product as expensive as the
core v2 when there are plenty of other
alternatives that do basically the same
thing for less money and that's where
I'm at with the core v2 were this
product 250 or even just $200 cheaper it
would be a decent purchase considering
all the things it does well but $500 is
simply not a competitive price tag if
you are interested in buying a GPU I
strongly recommend getting something
more affordable there are links to some
sensible options in the description
below what else do people say at the end
these it is oh yeah well I can subscribe
and do all that good stuff and have
course our season</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
