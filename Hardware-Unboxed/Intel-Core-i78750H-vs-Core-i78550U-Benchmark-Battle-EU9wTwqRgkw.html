video is a bit of an informative one if
you're deciding what sort of laptop you
need we'll be comparing the core i7 8750
h against the core i7 8550 you in a wide
range of productivity workloads to see
how these to 8th gen parts stack up this
should give you an idea of how much
faster the au 750 h is and whether you
need the power provided by this H series
CPU relative to the more power efficient
8550 you before getting into the numbers
let's talk specifications the core i7
8750 H is an 8th gen coffee-like CPU for
high-performance mobile devices it has a
45 watt TDP and for that you get 6 cores
12 threads and nine megabytes of l3
cache there's a base clock of 2.2
gigahertz but it can boost up to four
point one gigahertz on up to 2 cos 4.0
gigahertz on four course and 3.9
gigahertz on six cores the core i7
8550 U is a KB Lake refresh CPU that
sits in Intel's 8th gen lineup it's
designed for low to medium power
ultraportable laptops packing four cores
and eight threads into a 15 watt TDP
plus eight megabytes of l3 cache the
base clock is a rather low 1.8 gigahertz
though it boosts up to 4 gigahertz on up
to 2 cores and 3.7 gigahertz on for
cause obviously the key difference here
is the core count with the 8750 H
getting 2 extra cores at similar clocks
to the 8550 you
however the integrated GPU in both chips
is very similar the 87 58 uses Intel's
UHD 630 while the 8550 you uses the HD
620 the both GPUs have the same 24
execution unit so the only real
difference is GPU clock speed in any
case as the eye 78758 is often paired
with a discrete GPU graphics workloads
and gaming isn't really a focus of this
comparison our eye 78758 test system is
the gigabyte Aero 15 X which we've
reviewed previously on the channel if
you're interested for these tests we've
disabled the discreet nvidia geforce gtx
1070 max q GPU and
also upgraded the system to sixteen gig
of dual channel ddr3 for our I 78550 you
test systems we have two laptops one is
the Dell XPS 13 which is configured to
use the 85 50 use maximum 25 watt TDP up
state the other is the razor blade
stealth which uses a standard 15 watt
configuration let's get into the
benchmarks and we'll start with
Cinebench r15 here the 8750 h holds an
enormous 83 percent performance lead
over the 25 watt 8550 u which is down to
having 50% more cores and increased
capacity for higher clocks the clock
speed discrepancy grows with the 15 watt
8550 you hear the 8750 edge holds at 124
percent advantage so it's more than
twice as fast
the 8750 h holds a much more modest
performance lead in the single threaded
test it's nine percent faster than the
15 watt variant and seven percent faster
than the 25 watt variant the a 750 H
holds a similarly large performance
advantage in x264 encoding looking at
the more intensive second past the 8750
h is a good 87 percent faster than the
85 50 used 25 watt variant and 116
percent faster than the 15 watt variant
roughly speaking the coffee-like
processor provides double the
performance in rendering tasks which is
critical for those that want to edit or
render videos on these sorts of laptops
the Delta between the two CPUs is
slightly small in handbrake while
rendering x265 videos but it's still
pretty large the 8750 H is a hundred and
six percent faster than the 15 watt
variant and 77 percent faster than the
25 watt variant of the 85 50 you Excel
is a short workload that completes in a
few seconds so here the fast boosting
8550 you can narrow the margin to a
decent extent that said the a 750 H is
still faster than the 25 watt variant to
the tune of 56% and as our 15 wash'd
test system actually manages higher
burst clocks due to different tuning it
narrows the margin to an even 50%
what about Adobe Premiere well in our 4k
video rendering benchmark with some GPU
accelerated effects but no luma tree
color in this instance
the 8750 h holds a significant 61%
performance lead on the 15 watt 8550 u
and a 57% lead on the 25 watt moral
matlab is highly memory bandwidth
dependent with modern CPUs in basic
processing tasks like FFTs and OD es
hence why the difference between the
8750 H and 8558 is so small we're only
looking at a five to seven percent
performance lead to the 8750 h compared
to the 8550 you it's a different story
in 7-zip the 8750 h manages to
outperform the 15 watt 85 fifty-year by
42% in compression and 66% in
decompression in this workload as the
Dell XPS test system we have doesn't
reach as high both clocks in short
workloads again two different tuning as
I mentioned earlier the 87 58 holds a
huge 82 percent performance leading
compression and 105 % it decompression
it's important to note the tuning does
affect how the 8550 performs in their
sort of short workloads so the range of
results you can see here is pretty
common unfortunately I couldn't get
Pacey mark 10 to run on the Dell XPS 13
but we can see how the 8750 h performs
relative to the 15 watt 8550 you in this
test looking at the overall score the a
750 H is 14% faster though it does
manage a 31% performance lead in a
Productivity workload performance is
near identical in the digital content
creation workload and that's likely due
to a GPU bottleneck in Adobe Photoshop
while applying an iris blur to a large
image the 8750 H was 25 percent faster
than the 15 185 50 and 19 percent faster
than the 25 watt variant this is one of
the smaller performance deltas but it
does still give the 8750 h a convincing
performance advantage if you're
interested in IG PU performance I will
briefly mention some 3d mark results in
the cloud gate test we see the 8750 H
take a 5% lead on the 25 watt 8550 U and
a 16 percent lead on the 15 watt variant
most of this is down to a superior CPU
score with an e identical GPU score but
in the more GPU limited skydiver tests
this lead is eradicated which isn't a
surprise
the integrated GP of both ships is
basically the same so we've now seen how
the eye 78758 stacks up against the eye
78552 and the results probably won't
come as a massive surprise when you pick
a 45 watt CPU with more cause against a
15 watt cpu designed for low-power
systems the 45 watt CPU should win in
every scenario and by a large margin
the biggest performance gains in favour
of the 87 50h are seen in a video
rendering and other long workloads so if
you're thinking of purchasing a laptop
for video editing the a 750 H could give
you double the performance in some cases
it does HD CPUs are designed for these
sorts of professional workloads and it
shows in shorter multi-core workloads
like Excel and archive decompression the
performance difference between the two
CPUs is closer to the difference in core
counters but CPUs manage similar bursts
clock speeds still with 50% more cores
in the a 750 H that translates to around
50% more performance where you won't see
as significant performance gains is in
single threaded tests where the 8750 h
only has a single-digit performance lead
on the 8550 U and in integrated graphics
performance where both GPUs are
basically identical what CPU is right
for you will depend on the sort of
things you plan to do professionals that
want to render videos work with large
images compiled code run simulations and
so forth will be much better off with
the AI 78758
particularly if these tasks are
multi-threaded however if you aren't
just planning on browsing the web
editing documents or basic spreadsheets
and doing some light photo editing the I
78550 is perfectly fine particularly as
these less intensive tasks tend to be
more single-threaded
where the 8550 you compete strongly with
the 8750 h that's it for this quick cpu
comparison if you like this video don't
forget to give it a thumbs up subscribe
