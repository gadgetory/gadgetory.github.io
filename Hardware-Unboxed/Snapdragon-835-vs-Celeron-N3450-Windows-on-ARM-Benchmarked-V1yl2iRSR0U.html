we have some very interesting benchmarks
to go through I have in my hands the HP
Envy x2 which is the very first Windows
on arm device to hit the market that
means this very tablet is not powered by
an Intel or AMD x86 processor but an ARM
based Qualcomm SOC you typically find in
a smartphone now you might remember
Microsoft's efforts to get Windows
running on ARM chips way back at the
launch of Windows 8 with the variant of
the OS known as Windows RT this OS and
the products that ran it was some of the
biggest failures in Windows history to
the embarrassment of Microsoft and that
was all down to one simple fact you
couldn't run x86 desktop apps so you
were limited to using the crappy apps
found in the Windows Store and it's
really no wonder no one wanted to use
Windows RT this time around things are
different with the new windows on arm
devices you can actually run desktop x86
apps through emulation which makes the
whole platform actually useful apps in
the Windows Store will still provide the
best experience as most are you WP apps
that natively support arm but if you
need to run your favorite desktop apps
that should be possible in this new
iteration provided you don't run into
the many limitations of Windows on arm
for starters only 32-bit apps can be
emulated at least for now programs that
only have a 64-bit version will not work
at all x86 drivers of any kind are not
supported which is fine for
plug-and-play peripherals with generic
Windows drivers but anything that
requires a specific driver will not work
unless there's an arm 64 driver
available which is pretty unlikely the
list of limitations continues games that
use a version of OpenGL in newer than
1.1 won't work games that use anti-cheat
technology probably won't work apps that
customize windows may not work hyper-v
is not supported at all for running
virtualized environments and even some
are Maps that assume you are using phone
won't work so the question on everyone's
mind
windows on arm is what actually does
work and how well does it work I'm going
to go through some benchmarks first
exploring both emulated x86 and native
arm performance and then discuss some
more general thoughts on the platform we
had and boy you're in for a ride with
this one if you've seen my laptop
coverage before I tend to run a wide
range of benchmarks covering many
different common workloads
however with Windows on arm the
limitations of the platform means a
chunk of these benchmarks don't work
some didn't work as they were 64-bit
only and others didn't work for unknown
reasons
several benchmarks that I normally run
also as a 64-bit up I needed to
redownload as 32-bit to get working in
some terms those still didn't work bc
mark eights home tests for example works
but the creative test crashes and the
work test takes so long it's pointless
to run pc mark 10 launches but the
standard test is not supported Cinebench
r15 is 64-bit only and doesn't run
premier is also a 64-bit only app these
days blender has a 32-bit version but
requires opengl 2.1 so it doesn't work
matlab stopped providing a 32-bit
version recently but older x86 versions
i tried didn't work and sandra doesn't
work as i believe it needs to use an x86
driver so that's eight benchmarks that
don't work while nine that I'd normally
test with do work so roughly half there
my experiences with real world apps was
a little better than this you know it's
K apps for me like Chrome Photoshop
Excel Word Netflix Plex and Steam or
work but my problems with benchmarks do
give you an idea of how compatibility is
an issue with windows and arm even
though x86 emulation is supported
let's talk performance now because it
really doesn't get better when looking
at how fast x86 emulation is the nvx to
uses a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SOC which
is 2017 flagship smartphone SOC packing
eight cores split into two clusters
there's four cryo to 80 CPU cores
clocked at 2.45 gigahertz along with
four cryo to 80 efficiency cores clocked
at 1.9 gigahertz there's also an Audrina
540 GPU clocked at 710
and both the CPU and GPU are designed
in-house at Qualcomm and of course the
SOC is fabricated at 10 nanometers my
Envy x2 review unit and is worth
mentioning this has 8 gig of ram
although many units include is 4 gig and
there's also 256 gig SSD inside so
starting off with pc mark eights home
test and immediately it's not a good
news for windows on arms emulated
performance one of the cheapest and
slowest intel chips you can get in a
mobile form factor the gold montt based
seller on n 3450 is 51 % faster here 51
% the core i5 5200 you from 3 years ago
is a hundred and eighty-two percent
faster while the i7 7 y 75 intel's
current low-power core offering is a
hundred and sixty percent faster it's
pretty significant and it doesn't get
better in city bench are eleven point
five and yes we had to go back to our
eleven point five testing as there is
actually a 32-bit version of that
benchmark the snapdragon 835 is more
competitive against the n thirty four
fifty but the N thirty four fifty still
pulls ahead by six percent the 7y
seventy five more than doubles its
multi-core performance and just forget
about comparing it to something like the
i7 7500 you or i 78552 it just gets
obliterated on a more concerning note
single core performance is extremely
weak from the snapdragon 835 while
running emulated workloads the N thirty
four fifty doubles it's single thread
performance while the i7 7 y seven five
is more than five times faster yep five
times faster absolutely dire results for
Windows and arm emulation so far in fact
doing any sort of rendering is very slow
on the Snapdragon 835 the N thirty four
fifty slaughters windows on arm
emulation in x264 and x265 rendering and
again the N thirty four fifty is one of
the slowest intel chips you can get
moving on to photoshop and wow i
actually thought we know zona emulated
performance would be weak but this is
something else the large
288 megapixel test photo we use
absolutely chokes the Snapdragon 835
this is something I noticed while trying
to work with several other large files
and datasets the Snapdragon 835 is
simply not built for these tasks
especially while emulated there are some
benchmarks where windows on arm
performance isn't as embarrassing
compression and decompression is solid
provided as multi-threading with a
snapdragon 835 beating the N 30 450
handily in WinRAR and in 7-zip
decompression in tells other CPUs are
much faster but hey at least Windows on
arm gets a small win here it's similar
in the Excel Monte Carlo workload where
the Snapdragon 835 is a pretty
significant 62 percent faster than the
end of 3450 but only marginally slower
than the i5 5200 you the i7 7 y 75 is
still 47 percent faster in this test
though any GPU related workloads
including games tend to be the least
reliable on windows on arm however some
3d mark tests do work and the results
aren't too bad for the snapdragon 835 in
the more CPU limited Cloud Gate test the
835 beats the N 3450 though it does get
trapped by the i7 + 7 Y 75 and the
margin between the a 35 and the N 30 450
gets largely in skydiver as the GPU
becomes the bottleneck though again the
7y 75 is significantly faster so by now
you will realize that windows on our
performance is rather terrible if you
need to emulate an x86 app in most
situations the Snapdragon 835 can't
match or even come close to the Celeron
n 3450 while the faster core i7 7 y 75
utterly embarrasses the qualcomm SOC
these Intel CPUs have the advantage of
running x86 code natively and boy is
that a significant advantage however
there are some situations where you can
and will be running native code on the
ARM chip so it's fair to benchmark that
performance - and see how it stacks up
to roughly the same apps running on
Intel's x86 CPUs again using its own
native code the most interesting of the
tests here are the browser tests
Microsoft edge browser runs natively on
arm and x86 processors while Google
Chrome is x86 only it needs to be
emulate
here we have a selection of devices
running the octane benchmark in both
chrome and edge and I've included the
Google pixel to excel smartphone in here
as well just to see how it all stacks up
to the snapdragon 835 running it's
pretty decently in a phone the results
here really highlight the difference
between emulated and native code well
not a like-for-like as edge and chrome
is different rendering engines chrome
performance is terrible on the MV x 2
compared to edge in contrast CRO manager
roughly equivalent on the m30 450 while
chrome is much faster on the core i5
5200 you and yes I'm using the old I 550
200 you hear as we know the latest cable
they processes will destroy the
snapdragon 85 the important thing to
note here is the Envy x2 trades blows
with the N 3450 when looking at the edge
results while the i5 5200 you is just
37% faster it's also good to see the
windows on arm edge results matching
what we saw on the smartphone side which
suggests everything is working as
expected switch windows on arm to
running on an emulated version of Chrome
and it gets annihilated by the Intel
devices in this test in Basemark web 3.0
it's a similar situation using edge
gives the snapdragon 835 a handy
advantage allowing it to beat the m30
450 and come closer to the i5 5200 you
using Chrome gives the snapdragon 835 a
decent disadvantage due to emulation
another uwp app I benchmark was PDF
viewer plus one of the most popular PDF
viewers in the Microsoft Store here
windows own arm was quite competitive
posting a loading time between the end
3450 and i-5 5200 which is decent
considering a lot of the other results
at this point you've seen all the
benchmarks and all the performance
numbers for the first windows on arm
device powered by the Qualcomm
Snapdragon 835 it's an interesting
platform with some benefits as I'll get
to in a moment but the performance is
disappointing to say the least we're
looking at uwp apps that run natively on
arm the Snapdragon 835 is typically
faster than the Intel Celeron and 3450
and varying degrees slower than Intel's
core
processes from the last few years based
on limited testing admittedly certainly
when you put the nvx to next to an end
3450 based device just browsing through
explorer and using edge is noticeably
faster with windows on arm and i think
that's reflected to an extent with the
benchmark results however it's not
surprising to see the snapdragon 835
fall behind intel's of you and why
series core processes when looking at
native apps as a snapdragon 835 has a
very low TDP while intel's competing
chips can go as high as 15 or even 25
watts put more power into the equation
and you're pretty likely to win when it
comes to these sort of things however
the real killer is x86 emulation
performance being able to run x86
desktop apps is the key feature to this
new windows on arm platform and the
reason why it's more promising than the
failed Windows RT even ignoring the
compatibility issues for a moment x86
performance on arm chips is terrible
which puts the whole platform into
question at least in this early
iteration when the Snapdragon 835 fails
to get even close to a measly Atom based
Celeron processor in a number of
workloads you're not going to get a good
real-world experience when use the
device with a desktop app like Excel or
Photoshop it's really easy to get
frustrated by how sluggish laggy and
unimpressive the performance is using a
Celeron n 3450 is tough enough when
you're used to Core i5 or i7 performance
and the Snapdragon 835 is significantly
worse than this
now I'm sure Qualcomm or Microsoft will
tell you that emulating x86 apps is
meant to be a niche workload for those
devices and for the most part you should
be using edges your browser and uwp apps
from the store for everything else and
that makes sense as the performance of
emulation is so bad you might want to
use emulator apps very often the problem
there is K apps people use on a daily
basis and not available through the max
of store chrome for example is the most
popular browser but if you want to use
it with Windows on arm prepare for a
painful emulated experience now edge
isn't terrible but most people would
agree that it's not as good as chrome
adds features or web compatibility
I actually shudder at the thought of a
typical non enthusiast user buying one
of these devices because it looks good
on paper then switching from Windows 10s
to pro so that you can run desktop apps
I should mention earlier actually that
all windows on armed devices will ship
running Windows 10s by default and then
of course using edge to download Chrome
as per usual and then getting stuck with
horrendous performance I could go on
with more examples of commonly used apps
and not available natively on arm but
the basic point is x86 app emulation is
a key pillar to Windows on arm and the
performance really is not up to scratch
in its first iteration so at this point
you're probably wondering why have
windows on arm at all well there is a
key advantage and that's battery life
the nvx to last noticeably longer than
other devices out there from the limited
testing I've been doing even when using
emulated apps Qualcomm and Microsoft
both said Windows and our battery life
would be fantastic and I've seen nothing
from my time with it to suggest
otherwise windows on our devices also
support integrated LTE connections you
know due to the modems in Qualcomm SOC s
but this is less of an advantage of
these days as some Intel power devices
also have integrated LTE the Envy x2 is
also unbelievably quick at waking from
sleep and processing Windows hello
facial recognition so I guess there are
some heavily optimized areas of
performance too but my final thoughts on
Windows on arm are unfortunately largely
negative yeah you get fantastic battery
life but in my opinion it's not worth it
when the performance you get ranges from
disappointing to outright terrible there
aren't enough arm optimized apps but not
just your thews yes but typical users
wanting to run Chrome and office and
even in arm optimized apps you're not
going to match or even get close to the
performance Intel offers with their
lower power core processors the final
nail in the coffin is pricing the HP
Envy x2 we use for testing is
unfortunately a u.s. $1,000 tablet
Bachelor life is fantastic at this price
point but the Snapdragon 835 struggles
to outperform an Intel Celeron CPU
typically found in sub $300 notebooks so
simply way too expensive
windows and um devices are expected to
sell for as low as $600 which is a much
more appropriate price point but even
then I don't think it offers enough
value over existing Intel options for
example right now you can purchase the
entry-level surface pro with a court m3
processor for just 599 dollars down from
its regular price of $7.99 even with
just a core m3 process that the surface
pro is a much more capable device that's
way cheaper than the Envy x2
and it's similarly priced other windows
on arm devices and if you're more after
a laptop a quick search on Amazon brings
up mid-range laptops with is
significantly more powerful Core i5
8250 you for less than $600 this puts
the first iteration of Windows on arm in
a precarious position the price to
performance ratio simply isn't there at
the moment and it's compounded by
compatibility issues I could possibly
see windows and arm becoming a solid
niche option for basic users that want
great battery life and a content
browsing the web using edge and running
you WP apps but devices would have to
stay around $600 or ideally push even
cheaper for that option to be attractive
and I'm not sure the goal of Windows on
arm is to cement itself as an entry
level experience for this platform to
really succeed I think two things need
to happen firstly Qualcomm and other arm
partners need to release notably faster
chips at a similar level of power
consumption which sounds pretty
difficult but we do have chips like the
Snapdragon 845 already in the wild and
secondly the x86 emulation engine needs
to be refined significantly with a focus
on performance and 64-bit compatibility
there are some promising signs here if
you look closely enough and this
platform has much better foundations of
Windows RT ever did but right now it's
hard if not impossible to recommend
jumping in as a consumer and that's
disappointing considering the discussion
around the platform when it was first
announced I will have a full review of
the HP Envy x2 coming up soon and for
what it's worth
HP has actually delivered a really nice
piece of hardware here it's a shame
they've been let down by Qualcomm and
Windows and arm in general but I guess
that's the risk
you take in launching an early adopter
product anyway more on that later give
us like if you enjoy this windows on arm
