official risin 3 coverage at this point
you probably know just about everything
there is to know about the rise and
three 1300 x and 1200 with that little
exception of exactly how they perform
and of course the price that being the
case I'm going to jump right into the
benchmarks of this one I'm also going to
be looking at overclocking performance
throughout the benchmarks and then
towards the end of video I'll show you
just how well these rise in three CPUs
overclock using the race stealth box
cooler when we look at things such as
temperatures speaking of overclocking
the risin 312 hundred hits 3.9 gigahertz
using the Box cooler while the 1300 X
did slightly better hitting 4 gigahertz
so without any further ado let's get to
it
first up memory performance and here are
a few quick notes before we get into it
when I put together my rising through
simulated video I use ddr4 29:33 memory
with SMT disabled on the Rison v 1400
and i noted that it was unlikely that
the Rison 3 cpus would be able to run
with higher frequency memory so far this
has indeed been the case as neither the
1300 X nor the 1200 would post using
ddr4 3200 via the XMP setting so I was
forced to run ddr4 29:33 and this was
also the case with my horizon 5 1500 X
and 1400 CPU s nonetheless performance
was decent and we saw over 34 gigabytes
per second of memory bandwidth and that
figure was boosted to around 35 and a
half gigabytes per second once the CPU
is were overclocked moving on we have
the first CPU related benchmark and here
the risin 312 hundred shows fairly weak
single thread performance cover with
reasonably decent multi-threaded
performance the higher clocked 1300 X
made out a bit better matching the
single thread performance of the core i5
7500 with slightly weaker multi-threaded
performance overclocked both wise and
three CPUs achieved similar scores as
they are both now running at similar
frequencies both are faster than the
core i5 7500 for both the single and
multi-threaded tests for those
interested in compression and
decompression work we have 7-zip and
here the 1200 was a good
custom the pentium g 4560 but slower
than the core i3 7350 k the 1300 x was
much more impressive as a beat 270 true
50k and edged out the i5 7500 that said
though once overclocked both rise and
three cpus set comfortably ahead of the
core i5 7500 moving on from compression
work we have spreadsheet performance
with Microsoft Excel 2016
here the 1300 X did very well matching
the lower clocked 1400 meanwhile the
1200 did trail the i3 7500 K but it was
much faster than the G 4560 overclocked
we squeezed a little more out of the
rise in three CPUs but even so the 1,300
X still trailed the i5 7500 by a small
margin moving on we have the first of
four PC mark 10 test Suites that we're
going to look at the data here is
arranged by the video conferencing
results and here the rise and three CPUs
slide in between the Pentium D 45 60 and
Core i3
73 50k meanwhile once overclocked they
moved ahead of the core i5 7500 the
productivity test has been arranged by
the spreadsheet results and here the
Rison three CPU set at the bottom of our
graph behind the G 45 60 overclocked
though they did make up some
considerable ground in this test and
then they're able to match the horizon 5
1600 X and Core i5 7500 so quite an
extreme recovery there this graph has
been arranged by the photo editing
result and here the rise in 3 CPUs do
very well the 1300 X was almost able to
match the core i5 7500 and once
overclocked both the 1200 and 1300 X
pulled ahead and now are delivering 1500
X like performance finally we have the
video editing test and here the Rison 3
1200 was slightly faster than the G 45
60 while the 1300 X sat between the i5
7500 and I 373 50 K the higher clocked
core i3 CPU was the faster of the two
overclocking boosted performance
significantly and we are now seeing core
i7 7700 K light performance in this test
so very impressive stuff there moving on
from PC mark can we have the corona
benchmark and here the horizon 3 1200
wasn't much faster than the G 45 60
thankfully though the 3100 X was a good
bit faster and even managed to beat the
i3 7350 M
in fact it wasn't much slower than the
quad core i5 7500 overclocking
unfortunately didn't help improve the
1300 score by and noteworthy margin that
was now fast in the i5 7500 as was the
1200 so good result for the budget rise
and three CPUs nonetheless the horizon 3
1200 isn't much slower than the AI 373
50k in bilenda meanwhile the 1300 X was
faster than the core i3 73 50k but it
was also much slower than the i5 7500
unfortunately overclocked the 1300 X was
only able to match the i5 7500 I had
expected given the stock performance
that would pull ahead of here but as I
said unfortunately that wasn't the case
moving on to handbrake the Rison 3 CPUs
beat Intel's Pentium and core i3 range
but even overclocked didn't have enough
in the tank to match the Core i5 series
for content creators on a budget the
horizon series looks to be a godsend
especially once overclocked stock / 1200
roughly matched the i3 73 50k while the
1300 X at between the 1750 K&amp;amp;I v 7500
overclocked though the 1300 xB to the i5
7500 and isn't that much slow in the
risin 5 1400 so a great result in
Premiere Pro CC moving on it's now time
for some games please note that I have
dropped mafia 3 the games been hugely
inconsistent over the past few months
and another new recent patch has again
changed things for Rison I'm now seeing
much better performance from Verizon
similar what I was seeing many months
ago and raisin was first released but
the game has some other performance
glitches that were quite annoying during
testing so rather than waste any more
time with this title I'm dumping it for
good so here we have battlefield 1 and
some very interesting results indeed
please note I am using a high end GPU at
1080p but plan to release a more
in-depth gaming focus video soon using a
range of GPUs so hang tight for that one
anyway as I said these results as they
stand are very interesting out of the
box the horizon 3 CPUs do do very well
here particularly when looking at the
minimum frame rate which is considerably
better than that of intel's dual-core
hyper threading enabled g 45 60 and 70
350k overclocked the Rison 3c
you's are able to match the core i5 7500
which is an exceptional result moving on
the Hitman we do again see very strong
gaming performance Verizon three here
both the 1200 and 1300 easily beat the G
4560 while they are roughly on par with
the i5 or 7500 once overclocked they're
able to overtake the 7500 and deliver a
similar experience to the SMT enabled
quad core 1400 and 1500 X CPUs finishing
up the gaming benchmarks we have ashes
of the singularity and here we have some
slightly disappointing results it would
seem the lack of SMT support here really
hurts horizon 3 in this title even
overclocked the rising three CPUs were
quite a bit slow in the core i5 7500 and
their SMT enabled quad core parts now
onto power consumption the Rison 3 1200
thanks was relatively low clock speeds
was very light on the go juice pushing
total system consumption adjust 87 watts
in our excel test the 1300 X was quite a
bit hungrier considerably more than you
would expect based on the results seen
by the 1200 although the 1200 is clock
eight to ten percent lower total system
consumption was more like 26% lower the
reason for this being that Maya's rock
board was running the r3 1200 at a much
lower voltage than the 1300 X and this
really helps reduce consumption
overclock though they were much similar
but again I was able to hit 3.9
gigahertz using much less voltage than
it took to push the 1300 X 2 4 gigahertz
this intervention r15 power consumption
result more what I was expecting to see
that said the 1200 is still consuming
around 17% less power when comparing
total system figures which placed the
1200 on par with the i3 783 50k and i5
7500 once overclocked though I have to
say consumption was still very tame and
a 1300 X for example only pushed
total system consumption to 120 watts ok
so that concludes the power consumption
testing moving on to the temperatures
now for this testing I use the Wraith
stealth box color exclusively as I feel
this option makes the most sense for
these budget coolers that said though
there are $20 options which will enable
lower temperatures so be sure to keep
that in mind anyway out of the box the
1300 x peaked at 62 degrees
when stressing the CPU FPU and cache the
1200 hit
fifty-five degrees that was a very
impressive result indeed that said if we
stressed just the CPU which I feel is
probably a more realistic stress test
the 1,300 x max data just 49 degrees and
the 1,200 hit just 42 degrees for a box
cooler into heavier load they are simply
amazing results
moving to the overclocking results let's
look at the 1200 first again idle
temperatures were in the low 30s
stressing the CPU saw temps max out at
just 62 degrees while stressing the FPU
and cache saw temps touch on 72 degrees
going for the most part they did sit
around 67 degrees
I was also still using the default fan
curve here and I would describe the race
stealth as a very quiet cooler which is
probably the most shocking part now the
slightly higher clocked 1300 X of 4
gigahertz with that additional voltage
required the fan speed to be maxed out
that said even at full speed spinning at
2,600 rpm the race stealth isn't
hideously loud stressing just the CPUs
or temperatures hit 63 degrees which is
very manageable that said stressing both
the FPU and cash saw peaks of around 92
degrees though keep in mind for the most
part the system didn't sit at around 83
degrees which is much more acceptable so
all in all some incredibly good results
from the race stealth box cooler when
overclocking these rise on three CPUs
before wrapping things up let's take a
quick look at a few price versus
performance scatter plots now please
note we are just comparing CPU prices
here this doesn't take an oil count
additional costs like the need for a
cooler for Intel's K Series for example
well this graph is quite telling isn't
it for those of you wondering what
you're looking at the further to the
right the plots the better the
performance and the lower the plots the
better the price so basically you want
to be situated as far right as possible
and as low as possible doing just that
is the overclocked r3 1200 the 1200
wasn't much slower than the core i5 7500
while costing almost half as much
meanwhile it's still cheaper than the i3
73 50k but much faster when comparing
the minimum frame rate the overclocked
1300 X was slightly faster but also more
expensive there isn't much in it but the
1200 is still the better value choice
here moving on to handbrake
we see
scatterplot is again dominated by red
dots in all the right spots sorry about
that
anyway Angele does put up more of a
fight this time but for quite a bit less
than the core i3 7350 k the risin three
1200 delivers a smidgen more performance
overclock the 1200 pull the head of the
i3 semi 350 K of course you can
overclock the Intel chip but once you
factor in the price of a motherboard
with an overclocking enabled chipset and
a cooler the price versus performance
ratio turns to the stuff Intel users as
a Tim lastly we have Premiere Pro CC and
here the red team comes out in force
it's all Verizon here stop the r3 1200
is a particularly impressive but once
you overclock things change rapidly
for example the render times overclocked
it's not much slower than the core i5
7500 and of course at almost half the
price that's a very solid result looking
at this scatterplot it's pretty clear
for content creators Rison it's a bit of
a good thing okay time to wrap things up
so last week we checked out simulated
rising three performances in the r5 1400
with SMT disabled and a few minor
adjustments to the operating clock
speeds at the time we were working on
the assumption that the leaked pricing
info was correct which would see the r3
1200 price is 110 dollars us with the r3
1300 X coming in at $130 us and as it
turns out those figures were indeed
correct based on previous findings I
know that Rison 3 looked as though it
was going to be a decent proposition but
wasn't overly excited by what I saw yes
in terms of value it beats out the lock
core i5s and for that matter the entire
core i3 range but when compared to the
SMT enabled Rison 5 quad core such as
the 1400 and 1500 X I felt like spending
a little more to receive all eight
threads was probably going to be the
smarter move for most however we've now
got all the facts at hand previously I
wasn't sure on things such as the cooler
that would be included in the package
and what kind of overclocking Hedren we
could expect to see from these budget
processors as it turns out we get the
nice little race stealth and as we saw
that does a commendable job and it
allowed us it 3.9 gigahertz on my 1200
and 4 gigahertz almost there
900 X the fact that these overclocks
were achieved using nothing more than
the humble box cooler is nothing short
of amazing and it certainly adds a lot
of value to these chips especially when
you consider the core i3 70 350 K
doesn't come with a cooler at all and it
currently retails for one hundred and
fifty dollars u.s. so the Rison 3 1300 X
and 1200 are the obvious choice over the
dual core Core i3 70 350 K a CPU no one
should have been buying anyway
especially at $150 u.s. asking price and
this in my opinion is kind of the
problem rising three phases while
superior in terms of value it's beating
and already beaten line up from this
point forward I'll largely be
regurgitating the conclusion from my
rise and three simulator video a few
notes here and there but overall the
same message so here we go even today in
mid 2017 if I wanted to build an
affordable brand-new computer the
pentium g 45 60 still puts forward a
strong case that is assuming you can get
one for the MSRP of $64 u.s. it enables
playable performance in the latest
titles using an entry level or mid-range
graphics card and on top of that it's
super efficient however having said that
locally here in australia it's currently
out of stock everywhere i checked and in
the u.s. major retailers such as amazon
new egg and superb is for example are
all showing no stock at the time of
putting this video together PNH photo
had stock but we're asking $80 u.s. and
that's a 25% markup over the MSRP so I
feel like the intel pentium g 4600 is
the new budget choice from intel and
that's currently selling for a way way
less attractive $87 eos at that price
for me it's no doubt going to be Rison 3
1200 all day ignoring Intel lineup which
to be honest you really safely can do it
these price points the Rison v 1400 /
1500 x seem like the obvious choice and
yet if you were really serious about
your PC I would recommend save a little
extra cash and get the 6 core r5 1600
and call it a day
my reason for saying this is because if
you went for the cheapest possible
gaming rebuild with a basic be 350 board
8 gigabytes of ddr4 memory chip
Kayson power supply combo the geforce
gtx 1050 and something like a 500
gigabyte Seagate fire tutor sshd you'd
save just 18% on the entire build when
opting for the r3 1200 over the r5 1600
you'd be getting half as much level 3
cache to less cores and ate less threads
for those wondering the same system
would be just 10% cheaper with the r3
1200 opposed to the SMT enabled r5 1400
so again spending a little more does
seem to get you a lot more in this case
still if you're hell-bent on spending as
little as possible the Verizon 3 1200
just 110 dollars u.s. is a super chip
given that a 1300 X did only produce an
additional 100 megahertz overclock over
the 1200 and I feel like that's probably
a best-case scenario I don't feel like
spending an additional $20 is worth it
just get the base model 1200 would be my
advice overclocked to 1200 is a Ripper
often delivering 1500 X like performance
in games of course you can overclock the
1500 X for even more performance but
that's beside the point
well kind of almost half the price of
the core i5 7500 the overclocked r3 1200
obviously represents in the same value
and gamers can look forward to a similar
level of performance
anyway wrapping things up I'd again
conclude by saying that there'll be a
real issue for the horizon 3 lineup is
aimed a zone rather than 5 line up the
riving fires just so strong in terms of
value that said though I am keen to do
further testing as I always am I think
one cool test would be to take the r3
1200 clock at at 3 point 9 units as we
did in this very video and compare it to
the r5 1400 at the same 3.9 gigahertz
and then compare them in a huge range of
games using a mid-range graphics card to
see just how much difference there
really is of course as I just said there
is much more testing be done I have a
few more ideas I would like to do I
don't know for some of you this day one
review would have left a bit to be
desired and would have liked to see a
few more testing some mid-range GPUs and
the mix and stuff like that but they're
just really honestly isn't time to get
that much testing done for these day 1
reviews
they're pretty much rushed as it is I
want to touch on things like thermals
power consumption overclocking and all
that kind of important stuff and then
follow up later with more in-depth
benchmarking videos which is what I plan
to do I would like to a video where I
compare quite a few relevant CPUs with a
range of GPUs at a few resolutions in a
he per game so that in itself is going
to take a lot of time but possibly
something I'm even more keen to do is an
upgrade as guide where I'll include
something like the Sandy Bridge I 520
500k and the FX 8350 for example I think
that would be a really cool video but
anyway I'm going to end this one here if
you liked the video you know what to do
hit the like button for us really helps
us out subscribe if you haven't already
and HIPAA notification be able to put
yourself in contention to make that
all-important first comment I'm your
host Steve see again soon guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
