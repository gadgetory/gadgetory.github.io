corner today's episode is basically
going to be about nvidia geforce r-tx
graphics cards because since we
published our initial thoughts on the RT
x series earlier this week there's been
a few additional tidbits and revelations
to discuss so without further ado let's
get the right race ball rolling and talk
about some news the thing you guys are
probably most interested in is the
performance of NVIDIA GeForce r-tx cards
and how they stack up against previous
gen pascale offerings
as you are probably aware and video
spent most of their launch event talking
about rate racing and other RT X
functionality rather than discussing the
actual performance of these cards in
typical games
I think this frustrated a lot of people
that just wanted to know how much faster
in RTX 20 atti for example was outside
of niche use cases like rate racing well
we still don't have any independent
benchmarks to share it will be at least
a few weeks before we can but Nvidia did
post an article to their blog that at
least showed some charts comparing the
artex 2082 gtx 1080 in a selection of
games he's the child in question and for
just one image there's actually quite a
lot to break down here firstly all these
games were benchmarked at 4k but you can
see six titles where NVIDIA has chosen
to include results with DL SS or deep
learning super sampling enabled DL SS
uses the tensor cores to accelerate a
neural network that post processes
images to smooth jagged edges and all
that usual anti-aliasing stuff at a much
lower performance cost than regular
anti-aliasing the crucial thing to note
about DL SS is it doesn't run the game
at the native resolution so in this
chart the DL SS results are not really
being run at 4k like the rest of the
results instead the game is effectively
rendered at a lower resolution and then
up scaled with AI taking care of
upscaling artifacts we'll have to wait
and see how DL SS impacts visual quality
but like with other sub native rendering
techniques including checkerboard
rendering temporal rendering and so
forth there is usually some negative
impact of visual quality that helps give
you that uplift in performance so
comparing the
- the 2080 with DSS enabled isn't a
great apples to apples comparison
you also notice that Nvidia claims the
ITX 2080 provides two times the
performance of the 1080 but that's only
possible in these DL SS games and even
then two of the 6d OSS titles didn't
actually reach 2x performance so that 2x
number isn't an accurate reflection of
the performance difference between the
two cards and typical games with
identical quality settings when looking
at the nandi LSS results you can see the
2080 provides a performance improvement
anywhere from roughly 1.6 X down to 1.3
X however there's a few other things to
note four of these games to test with HD
are enabled likely with g-sync HR
enabled on one of the new 4k 144 Hertz
monitors it wasn't that long ago that we
tested the performance impact of HDR and
gsync Asia and discovered that at least
with Pascal cards enabling HDR can
reduce performance by as much as 15% in
titles like shadow of war which Nvidia
is showing here with some of the largest
performance gains if churring has
architectural fixes that cope better
with HDR and gsync HDR processing
enabling HDR on the r-tx 2080 might not
come with the performances this means
the testing with HDR enabled in these
games will inflate the margin between
the 2080 and 1080 imagine that wouldn't
be as high when playing the game in the
SDR mode which 99.9% of gamers use I'm
not saying for sure that shooing has
changes that result in no performance
impact when enabling HDR but the fact
Nvidia here has specifically chosen to
test some of these games with HDR
enabled throws up a red flag for me it's
not going to be a common setting or
common use case for these cards and
companies always want to portray their
products in the best light so it
wouldn't be surprising if enabling HDR
in these titles skewed things in favor
of the RT X 2018 and then of course
there's the usual disclaimers about
performance numbers provided directly
from the company Nvidia has almost
certainly cherry-pick the selection of
games to make the artex 20/80 seem as
good as possible we don't know what
settings were used to benchmark these
games either and that means further
cherry-picking might have occurred with
the game settings and
then there's this other slide that shows
just ten games with random FPS numbers
below apparently illustrating the ITX 28
you can play these titles at 4k HDR at
above 60fps to be honest this image is
completely useless because there is no
comparison data and we have no idea what
settings were used you can quite easily
tune these tiles to run at above 60fps
at 4k on something like the GTX 1080 so
yeah not all that useful even if
invidious performance numbers here are a
general reflection of how the r-tx 20/80
performs it still isn't looking all that
good for these nutrient cards so the
cheapest r-tx 2080s you can pre-order
right now are around 750 US dollars
compared to just four hundred and fifty
dollars for new gtx 1080s which is a 67%
increase in price Yemen videos own chart
shows most games providing around a 40
percent performance uplift so again it's
looking like the ITX cards might not be
the best value we strongly suggest you
don't pre-order and don't purchase one
of these GPUs until full performance
reviews are available the other big
story from this week concerns the
performance of ray-tracing in RTX
enabled games particularly shadow of the
Tomb Raider and battlefield 5 both of
which were demoed on the show floor at
Gamescom numerous publications who
played these games report a performance
that wasn't all that impressed shadow of
the Tomb Raider running at just 1080p on
an RT x28 ETI with ray tracing enabled
didn't hit a consistent 60 FPS often
hovering around 40 to 50 FPS with clear
dips into the 30s and we're talking
about the fastest shirring GPU here for
consumers running the game at just a
1080p resolution instead of the Tomb
Raider in particular I actually watched
IGN's I think it was an extended capture
of the game with ray tracing enables and
to be honest the lighting didn't look
significantly improved compared to
traditional non raytrace lighting at
least the improvement wasn't really
enough to justify running at some 60fps
at 1080p on a graphics card that cost
more than a thousand told us of course
have to play the game for myself and see
how ray tracing looks but the general
impression from people at the event and
from you guys out there that have
watched
footages that looked pretty
underwhelming I should note here of
course that the version of the game
being demoed was a pre-release version
the drivers were pre-launch and there's
still plenty of scope for optimisation
but I'm not sure optimization will be
able to improve things all that much
when setting appears so taxing from the
start the other game showed was
battlefield 5 and again reports
suggested the game was running at sub
60fps at 1080p with ray tracing enabled
on an RT X 20 atti which is even more
dire for a fast paced game like a
first-person multiplayer shooter ray
tracing does look very impressive in
battlefield but again most gamers won't
want to run at below 60 FPS on a
flagship card just to get some nice
looking reflections and shadows this
sort of performance we're enabling ray
tracing isn't super surprising
considering how computationally taxing
ray tracing is but when it's the killer
new feature of invidious upcoming
graphics cards and it's one of the
reasons why they're so expensive it's
cause for concern to say the least it's
probably worth talking about the full
list of games confirmed to support RT x
functionality and nanotech he has a
nicely organized list that shows whether
the game supports real time ray tracing
DL SS or both the key games to show here
are as follows we've got battlefield 5
and Metro Exodus both support ray
tracing but not DL SS shadow of the Tomb
Raider is shown to support only ray
tracing as well but interestingly in
videos own performance lights from
earlier the game is shown to support DL
SS so not sure what's up with that pub G
hitman 2 and Final Fantasy 15 support
just DL SS so no ray tracing there and
there's a couple of others the new
version of assetto corsa very popular
racing game will support ray tracing as
will control the upcoming trial from
remedy entertainment the makers of
quantum break and Alan Wake neither of
those games support DL SS a couple of
other quick things to round out this
video the GeForce r-tx 2070 does not
have an NV link connector as confirmed
by photos of the RT X 2070 and also in
videos page showing the supported
graphics cards for the NV link bridge
essentially just the art X 2080 and RT X
xx atti will have the connector NV link
replaces the
SOI connector offering a much higher
bandwidth interconnect between multiple
GPUs SLR connectors were removed from
the gtx 1060 in the previous version
restricting the functionality to just
the 1070 and above and now with the
artex 20 series the connector is gone
from the 2070 so that limits sli to just
the upper end cards generally we don't
recommend anyone use SLI anyway due to
its poor scaling and lack of support in
a lot of games but it's interesting and
Vidya is removing the option from more
cards last topic for this Nvidia special
edition news corner Nvidia has announced
Ansel r-tx an upgraded version of Ansel
that makes use of the RT X capabilities
of truing GPUs for the few people that
use Ansel there are some cool features
in here like Ansel ray tracing which
injects way more rays than would be
suitable for real-time rendering to
deliver a much higher quality static
image there's also Ansel AI up res which
allows you to save Ansel screenshots in
up to 8 K through the power of 10
circles and AI there's also a few new
filters and a wider range of supported
games that's it for this week's news

YouTube doesn't work all that well
sometimes check out Steve's video as
well on our first impressions of the
GeForce r-tx use if you missed it
