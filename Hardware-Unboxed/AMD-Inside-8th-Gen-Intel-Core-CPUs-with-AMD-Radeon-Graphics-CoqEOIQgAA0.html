have some big news to discuss Intel and
AMD a teaming up yep you heard that
right this isn't a joke now we used to
pretty fiery head-to-head battles
between AMD and Intel and this year in
particular they've been plenty of those
however it was just announced by Intel
that future core series processors will
have a Radeon graphics inside this
partnership between AMD Intel has been
rumored for quite some time now
certainly well over a year and while
some we're convinced it was on it just
seemed a little too crazy to be true but
despite the odds it's very true as
unlikely as it seemed that Intel would
work directly with AMD the idea really
made sense Intel's integrated graphics
are terrible if I'm honest and after
countless years of development they've
really made very little headway
although severely lacking in the CPU
Department AMD zone ap use have provided
significantly better graphics
performance when compared to anything
Intel's been able to produce and this
has been particularly problematic for
Intel's mobile products therefore
Intel's bit the bullet and has decided
to employ AMD Radeon graphics for their
eighth generation h-series core chips in
the hope of bringing top-tier gaming to
thin and white notebook PCs a key bit of
technology to making this possible as
Intel's embedded multi die interconnect
bridge or emmab for sure I'm sure
AMD probably have an internal code name
for it perhaps it's superglue generally
CPUs are made using a single continuous
slab of silicon which includes
everything from the processing course to
the integrated graphics emmab now makes
it possible to connect multiple dies for
example you could connect a 10 nanometer
die with a 40 nanometer diamond a 22
nanometer die essentially this
technology allows for a more modular
design a bit like AMD's infinity glue
I'm I mean fabric granted multi chip
packages aren't anything new but emid
makes it possible at a much higher
bandwidth and again this is much like
what we've seen through AMD Zone
infinity fabric
as far as we can tell at this point
email is only being used to connect to
the radio and GPU to the HBM to memory
stack more on HBM in a moment how the
GPU connects to the CPU cores hasn't yet
been revealed by AMD but if they're
illustration proves to be accurate then
it seems that the distance between the
CPU and the GPU is simply too great for
a member to be implemented
you'd have to assume that the PCI bus is
being used here and this is a proven
method that provides plenty of bandwidth
and well this is how discrete GPUs in
your normal computer connect to your CPU
and I'd say the reason why the distance
on the package is so great between the
CPU and the GPU is to help manage the
thermal output the fact that these
upcoming mobile core processors from
Intel will leverage the power of
families of radio and technology is a
big deal but doing so well using HBM to
memory is a seriously big deal AMD's own
upcoming Rison based a views won't even
take advantage of HP m2 memory rather
they'll make use of ddr4 system memory
so this means Amy's own graphics will
likely perform better in Intel CPUs
thanks to the increased memory bandwidth
of course all this is yet to be seen but
in any case it will likely end up being
a win-win situation for AMD
although Nvidia currently owns the
largest chunk of the discrete GPU market
the biggest player in the GPU market is
actually Intel thanks to their embedded
or integrated GPUs Intel owns the vast
majority of the market around 70% in
fact and this is due to the fact that
although mainstream desktop and mobile
CPUs ship with Intel HD graphics inside
while gamers might not use it it's still
there anyway with Intel now shifting to
AMD graphics for their mobile parts this
will drastically increase Amy's market
share and will likely boost its mind
share as well the likely result of this
will be that more game developers will
probably start to prioritize Radeon
graphics part of the agreement between
Intel and AMD is that Intel buys the
chips from AMD and AMD provides full
driver support just as they do with
their console customers as you no doubt
aware display drivers play a crucial
role at the most basic
then shot the operating system can
communicate with the graphics card and
vice versa but they've become
increasingly complex over the years and
now they require constant updates like
monthly updates to support new games and
technology intel's own graphics
technology hasn't just been lacking on
the hardware front but also on the
software side of things it's just less
of an issue given that you can't really
play modern games on intel HD graphics
due to our lack of rendering power it's
not yet clear if Intel's going to
completely drop their own integrated
graphics from the chips that have the
Radeon graphics or if they'll just keep
it around as a low powered option that
can be switched to we're not handling
intense 3d tasks it seems a likely that
Intel won't ditch their own graphics
technology and instead just keep it
around to handle things like accelerated
video playback for example saving as
much power as possible in a mobile
device is obviously a priority and
powering up a much more complex GPU
along with the HBM to memory just four
basic tasks probably wouldn't make that
much sense there's still a lot of things
that we don't yet know about these
upcoming mobile processors but we do
know they're on the way and we do know
they should arrive in the first quarter
of 2018 if this new partnership is
successful than it will certainly put
Nvidia in a very precarious position
things continue to get more and more
interesting in the CPU and GPU space and
I can't wait to see what 2018 brings
anyway that's going to do it for this
one I'm your host Steve see you again
soon guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
