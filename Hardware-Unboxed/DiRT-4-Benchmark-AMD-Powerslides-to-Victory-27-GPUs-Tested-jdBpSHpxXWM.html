for action over the weekend I had a
quick look at what it takes to play
codemasters newly released racing title
and in the end found gamers really only
require fairly modest hardware to enjoy
the game at all of its glory at 1080p
targeting 60fps I also got a bit sick
over the weekend just to come on cold so
nothing to worry about
I didn't let it slow me down too much so
there's plenty of benchmarks the over
but if I stand a bit on on this one more
than usual that's what I'm blaming it on
anyway intel's pentium g 45 16 am
neither radeon RX 570 proved to be the
perfect pairing despite recent driver
updates from both AMD and NVIDIA on the
9th the red team still looks to have the
edge in this title and we'll look at the
numbers shortly AMD's crimson Reliv
edition seventeen point six point one
driver cleaned up to a 30% performance
improvement over the previous driver
that's obviously a massive difference
and that claim was made when using the
RX 580 with eight times MSAA enables
however the ultra quality preset which
is the highest preset in the game and
the highest level of quality things i
will be testing with only enables for
time MSAA
but you can probably still expect
optimal performance across the board
with this driver as for NVIDIA there 380
2.53 WH GL driver claims to provide an
optimal gaming experience for dirt for
that said given what you're about to see
I'd say there's already a more optimal
driver in the works for this video I
will be focusing exclusively on current
and previous generation GPUs and testing
takes place at 1080p 1440p and 4k please
note the rx 480 and 470 have been
dropped from the results for this one
since they are very similar to the newly
released rx 580 and 570 without them I'm
still tested a grand total of 27 GPUs so
I feel like there should be enough there
for a solid reference point all testing
has been conducted using my core i7 7700
K test system clocked at 4.9 gigahertz
and I won't be including any other cpu
results for this title do it Ford
doesn't require a powerful CPU which is
why I went with the G 4560 previously
the game
mainly heavily loads a single thread and
that most uses two threads efficiently
beyond that on most modern quad cores or
greater you will only see 20% or less
utilization on additional threads that
doesn't have amine the games call the
optimized it just means it's not CPU
intensive this isn't an ARMA 3 type
scenario for example or a single thread
gets pounded and the CPU is still the
performance limiting factor in other
words I'm not seeing a seafood
bottleneck in this game of course it
would be better if the game engine
distributed load more evenly but for a
game like don't fall that's primarily
GPU bound it's not an issue for those of
you wondering I saw almost no difference
in performance when using the GTX 1080
TI @ 1080p using either the pentium g 45
60 or a heavily overclocked core i7 7700
k the cpu really does make little
difference here horizon v 1400 1600 and
1700 for example also delivered very
similar performance and again we're able
to roughly max out the GTX 1080 Ti using
an NVIDIA GeForce 10 series GPU the game
consumes almost 4 gigabytes of vram at
1080p using the ultra quality settings
about four and a half gigabytes at 1440p
and around six gigabytes at 4k using
AMD's Radeon rx 588 gigabyte these
figures were slightly inflated hitting
four and a half gigabytes at 1080p just
over five gigabytes at 1440p and around
seven and a half gigabytes at 4k so this
again is evidence that in videos memory
compression technology is slightly
superior when it comes to RAM usage that
is to say system memory the game
typically consumes around four to five
gigabytes depending on configuration the
exception to this will be seen when
using a graphics card that features a
limited via Ram buffer at resolutions
that can't handle
anyway for the most part eight gigabytes
of RAM should have you covered for this
title okay well I think that's about
everything let's check out how the
various graphics cards got on so kick
starting things off we have the historic
lineup those big old 28 nanometer GPUs
from a time a long long ago 2014 I think
it was anyway despite their advanced age
the B team does a great job in this
title at least the mid-range enough does
anyway right away we see the gtx 960
trailing the r9 380 by 17% margin while
the GTX 970 was 31% slaw
from the r9 390 in fact while the gtx
980ti was able to pull the head of the
r9 390 by a small margin when comparing
the average framerate it was 5% slower
when comparing the minimum therefore it
was the fury ax that pulled ahead at
1080p rendering an impressive 96 fps
making it 20% faster from the 980 TI on
average and 31% fast when comparing the
minimum frame rate the higher-end NVIDIA
GPUs are suffering some kind of issue
when it comes to the minimum frame rate
which is very strange and well worth
keeping an eye on upping the resolution
to 1440p changes things quite
drastically and now the NVIDIA GPUs come
right back into play it's almost like we
were seeing a driver overhead issue for
NVIDIA at 1080p
wouldn't that be ironic anyway at 1440p
the GTX 960 is now just a single frame
slower than the r9 380 that said the GTX
970 is still quite a bit slower than the
r9 390 trailing by 25% margin the gtx
980ti is able to close it on the fury x
though it is still quite a bit slower
when comparing the minimum frame rate in
fact the 46 FPS minimum of the 980 TI
means it can only match the Nano and r9
390x now the extreme 4k resolution none
of the GPUs tested were really able to
deliver satisfactory performance so the
fact that in video has caught up here is
of no consequence the fury X managed 36
fps while the gtx 980ti averaged 37 fps
and with minimums around 30 FPS the
input lag was quite difficult to deal
with ok so now it's time for the fresh
new silicon to show what it's got
previously 96 FPS at 1080p was as good
as it got with the fury X and I have to
say that result looks even more
impressive as the GTX 1080 pushed just
106 FPS on average yes the Titan XP and
GTX 1080i were faster again but
naturally you would expect them to be
further down the food chain we find the
GeForce GTX 770 and things aren't all
what you would expect with an average of
79 FPS the 1076 alongside the RX 580 in
fact it's one FBS slower when comparing
the minimum frame rate meanwhile the gtx
1066 gear bar is just 30% slower than
the RX 580 when comparing the minimum
frame rate in fact even the RX 5 70
beats at the gtx 1060 so again more
evidence than
has some work to do jumping up to 1440
pcs very few GPUs capable of achieving
60fps though once again the margin
between AMD and NVIDIA does close up the
GeForce GTX 1060 isn't a great deal
slower than the RX 580 now or at least
compared to what we saw at 1080p the gtx
1070 pulls ahead of the RX 580 providing
slightly better minimum frame rate
performance with a much stronger average
then finally at 4k it's just the gtx
1080i that breaks the 60 FPS barrier I
shouldn't know that the gigabyte or SD 2
X 1080 I was used for testing while the
Titan XP is obviously a reference card
now throwing all 27 GPUs into a single
graph we get this mess here we get a
sense of just how well the fury X is
performing in relation to NVIDIA GPUs
right now it was just 9 percent slower
than the GTX 10 a DTI and Titan XP when
comparing the minimum frame rate at
1080p it was also quite interesting to
see graphics cards such as the GTX 1060
getting completely mobbed by the
previous generation r9 390 the issue
seen at 1080p for NVIDIA seem to be
resolved at 1440p as now the GTX 1080 is
significantly fast in the fury X even
when looking at the minimum frame rate
that said the GTX 1070 still loses out
to the Nano and 390 X for the minimum
frame rate then at 4k we see it really
takes a current generation GPU and even
within video not hitting full stride at
least in my opinion they still led the
high-end benchmarks by a country mile
last up we have some quality preset
testing which has been carried out at
the 1440p resolution using the gtx 960
and RX 580 some interesting results can
be seen here so all the results seemed
previously were based on the ultra
preset and here we see the RX 5 that is
almost 30% faster oh and please note
that for the preset testing I have used
a different section of the game for
testing so the numbers here won't align
with those seen previously though the
performance trend will be similar
anyway whereas the GTX 1060 was almost
30% slower using the ultra preset it was
just 11 percent slower using high but as
we move to medium the 1060 pulls ahead
is now 10% faster and this was also seen
when using the low and ultra low presets
as well there is clearly something
enabled or turned on with
hi Ultra presets that hurt in video more
than AMD while it's great the GeForce
owners can boost performance
dramatically by lowering the quality
settings it's all AMD right now where it
counts before wrapping things up here's
a quick look at the various quality
presets side-by-side recorded using a
Titan XP at 4k that's six of a crash a
break for 60
right three
I'm pay a bit left
and break6 let's six
left six sixty right five of above 80
left six of them 16 right six in the
best one law right now AMD is showing
very strong performance in dirt for
particularly when looking at the minimum
frame race that said if you back off the
quality preset lowering from say old
shredder high nvidia does start to catch
up the gtx 1060 for example so a massive
sixty percent boost in performance while
the RX 580 improved by 40 percent and I
suppose either way that's some pretty
big numbers for both AMD and NVIDIA for
what was a very minor downgrade in the
visual quality running the game at high
allowed both graphics cards to average
well over 60 FPS at 1440p so unless
you're running extreme hardware I highly
recommend using the high quality preset
in favor of ultra and of course this is
pretty much true for most modern games
as usual the vegetation completely
hammers performance when set to ultra
circuits that will light on vegetation
so desert circuits I would run it over
70 FPS on a mid-range graphics card then
those with heavy vegetation like where I
tested that figure was pretty much hard
again when it comes to CPU performance
the game really only uses one or two
threads and while that certainly sounds
bad it's not really as this game just
doesn't require a cool app you see for
you to perform well and we found this
over the weekend with the pentium g 45
60 as it was able to provide a smooth
and enjoyable experience in dirt for
well that brings me to the end of my
dirt for performance coverage for now
I'll be sure to keep an eye on driver
developments and report back with what I
find I'm your host Steve see again soon
guys
