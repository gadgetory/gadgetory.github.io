week I showed you just how well the
risin 320 200 G performs when
overclocked with a basic air cooler
worth about $20 in short I was able to
overclock the GPU to 1.65 gigahertz the
CPU cost of 3.9 gigahertz and with this
overclock in place and our budget cooler
we were able to keep temperatures under
60 degrees when gaming the results were
great the overclock netted us around 20%
more performance on average and it
allowed the 2200 G to match the 2400 G
and this map performance was often
comparable to the pentium g 45 60 and
GeForce GT 1030 combo for that video I
focused on Teddy P gaming using either
the low or medium quality presets and
again the phrase the second results
looks good in fact depending on the
title they looked very good but what
does the game actually look like when
using these settings and how smooth is
it well in today's video we're going to
take a closer look at gameplay itself
and ignore all the benchmark graphs
which isn't going to be easier for me
because I do love my benchmark graphs
whole other following gameplay has been
recorded using the Rison 320 200 G with
the GPU overclocked you 1.65 gigahertz
and the CPU cores at 3.9 gigahertz then
we have 8 gigabytes of dual channel ddr3
20 memory on the MSI be 350 morter
motherboard right so we've got 16 games
to check out let's get into it it's been
some time since I actually played
battlefield 1 and I'll throw into a map
I didn't recognize I assume this is a
new map but what do I know actually what
I do know is that with the low quality
preset the game still looked ok and the
overclocked 2200 G played superbly with
smooth and consistent frame rates here
we thought the frame rate was
consistently above 40 fps and I saw just
over 50 FPS on average so overall a very
satisfactory gaming experience at tally
P having been so pleased with
battlefield 1 R then quickly jumped in
the battlefront 2 normally I would
describe this game as beautiful and well
optimised although it did still look
quite nice with the low quality preset
that performance was horrible on the APU
the game stuttered like mad
so some driver work will be required
here another fail can be seen when
trying to play ashes of the singularity
I mean technically is still possible
play this title but the frame rates were
low and I personally wouldn't actually
enjoy playing under these conditions
stuttering could also be seen at times
and for those wondering I did test with
the DirectX 12 API and the game kept
crashing when I tried to use the Vulcan
API like battlefield one the Call of
Duty World War two multiplayer
experience was quite good this time I
was using the normal quality settings
which I'd equate to sort of a medium
type setting this time I saw a minimum
of 37 FPS and an average of around 50
FPS that was certainly playable but
unlike battlefield 1 the experience
wasn't perfect there was the odd frame
hitch here at times but nothing like
what we saw with battlefront 2 moving on
to csgo as you might expect this tunnel
ran perfectly even with the visual
quality settings maxed out the real
issue here the hope was my lack of skill
still I persevered for a bit and enjoyed
the experience with over 100 FPS for the
most part the frame time performance was
also excellent
I saw no stuttering or issues in this
title the dirt poor experience was great
though I did have the quality preset
turned all the way down to its lowest
value still there should be a bit of
headroom here to increase the quality
settings I saw on average 95 FPS however
despite the impressive frame rates there
was noticeable stuttering at time so
again a little driver work needs to be
done here increasing the quality
settings didn't reduce the overall frame
rate that much but it did increase the
amount of stuttering I was seeing so
that's the reason why I went for the
lowest possible quality preset moving on
we have dota 2 and here the frame rates
weren't actually that impressive again
we were using the highest quality
settings for this title but it was still
very playable you could of course reduce
the quality settings and that might
improve performance but I didn't really
feel it was that necessary as the game
was still very playable as it was then
we have f1 2017 and this is probably one
of the best examples I have of a game
that looks good and plays even better on
the Raven Ridge AP use granted the frame
rates weren't super high but they were
very smooth and we saw no frames
stuttering at all
also it's well worth noting that for
this tale we were using the medium
quality preset with taa enabled so if
you prefer higher frame rates over a
visual quality then there is remember to
move with this title moving on I gave
fortnight a whirl and this is another
title it played very well with the
medium quality preset enabled at 1080p
with 100% render scale I saw almost 80
FPS on average with a minimum of 55 FPS
there was the odd a frame glitch here
and there but it didn't really detract
from the overall gaming experience and I
would describe the gameplay as very
smooth Grand Theft Auto 5 now this was a
mixed bag for me sometimes it played
really well at over 50 fps and it was
really consistent but then at other
times it was really stuttering like ii
long pauses and I even ran into sections
of the map that completely failed to
render for testing I did use with the
lowest possible quality setting so I
also tried with a 2 gigabyte frame
buffer though none of this seemed to
help so this is another title that needs
a bit of driver work along with f1 2017
I have to say overwatch was one of the
best experiences I have when testing
overclocked 2200 G using the medium
quality preset the game averaged 70 FPS
and never dipped below 56 fps the frame
time performance is also excellent here
we were faced with extremely smooth and
consistent gameplay I actually had a
heap of fun playing overwatch on this
APU and if you're someone who spent
countless hours sharpening your skills
I'd say you're still able to perform at
your best on this APU
a game that I was sure would run well
was pray and while that was indeed the
case that's how I was forced down to the
very low quality settings and this
allowed for between 40 and 50 fps and
there was the odd frame spike here and
there but it was nothing I'd really
worry about I didn't notice it when
playing overall the performance was good
for a sub 60 FPS experience and of
course as you can see it was very
playable I had expected that pubget
would deliver the worst experience of
all the games I'd decided to play and
while it certainly wasn't good it
actually wasn't as poor as what I saw in
battlefront 2 and ashes of the
singularity for example that said it was
still barely playable with frame rates
often hitting or barely hitting 30fps
moving on to rocket League this is a
title that I had expected would play
probably a little better than it did
actually granted we are at 1080p with
the maximum quality settings but for
some reason I thought that a constant
60fps would be possible still it
certainly wasn't a poor experience and I
saw an average of 51 fps in a minute of
a 42 fps and the frame time performance
was very solid so rocket League fans
have a lot to look forward to with this
budget apu well I expected a lot when
playing rocket League I expected nothing
when playing watchdogs - and that's
pretty much what I got this is one of
the worst gaming experiences I had with
the 2200 G probably worse than
battlefront - and the frame rates barely
pushed 30fps and stuttering was just a
major issue so I wouldn't wish this
gaming experience on anyone finishing
strong we have World of Tanks the new
game engine and this played superbly on
the Raven Ridge apu the benchmarks are a
minimum at 54 fps and an average of 79
fps and this was using the medium
quality settings and once again at a VP
not only with a frame rate higher but
the frame time performance was also
excellent that concludes our look at the
overclocked 2200 G gaming performance I
hope this gives those of you considering
purchasing this APO a good idea of what
you're in for
as you've seen the experience really can
vary greatly from title the title so
it's important to research how these aps
behave in the titles you intend on
playing for example if you're all about
pub G then I suggest looking for
something else maybe a just straight in
via GPU is perhaps a highly clocked
Intel quad core however if you enjoy
title such as overwatch fortnight f1
2017 and even Battlefield one for
example then there is simply no cheaper
option to get into these games and start
having a bit of fun
the great thing about The Horizon 320
200 G is the fact that it is an unlocked
quad core and while the Vega 8 GPU
inside will tie you over for now in 6 or
12 months when graphics card prices
hopefully settled down you can upgrade
the GPU firepower and keep the CPU for
years to come
still be aware that AMD does have some
driver optimization work ahead of them
so the experience can be frustrating
times but for the most part it was very
good especially for the hundred dollar
asking price for the rice and 320 200 G
