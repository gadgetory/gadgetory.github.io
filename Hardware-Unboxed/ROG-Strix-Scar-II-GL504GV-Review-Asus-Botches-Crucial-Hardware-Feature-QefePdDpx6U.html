we're looking at the brand new Asus ROG
Strix scar to GTL 504 GV a gaming laptop
with a long product name but some of the
latest Hardware inside including the new
NVIDIA GeForce r-tx 2060 I've already
posted an in-depth benchmark review of
the RT X 2060 so check that out if you
haven't yet because today we're more
focusing on what this overall gaming
laptop package provides like a lot of
refreshed RT X laptops there hasn't been
a significant change to the design or
most of the internal hardware previously
I reviewed the 15 inch scar 2 and it
either came with the GTX 1060 or gtex
1070 while now you'll either get an RT X
2060 or our Tex 2070 albia at slightly
different price points my review unit is
the GL fiber 4gb here so we're seeing
the RT X 2060 model and it's priced at
eighteen hundred US dollars or 2700
ozzie other hardware is largely
unchanged compared to the previous model
we're still looking at Intel six core
Core i7
8750 H CPU for most models 16 gigabytes
of ddr4 memory and a 15.6 inch 1080p 144
Hertz IPS display the primary storage
options have been bumped up a tear
across the board so previously where you
received a 128 gig SSD in the entry
model you're now up to 256 gigabytes and
so on my laptop and the main option
available on Newegg and Amazon comes
with a 512 GB SATA SSD in terms of
design what we're looking at here is the
same as the previous cartoon moral which
I guess makes sense because both have
the same name aside from the brushed
aluminium lid most of the laptop uses a
plastic construction with the soft touch
coating applied around the keyboard this
soft touch area has a carbon-fiber
design with half of it getting a camera
print I'd probably prefer if the camera
wasn't there but a Sewell has to do that
sort of thing yes there's RGB here too
you get a strip along the front edge of
the laptop plus the off center a soos
ROG logo on the lid both controllable
through a Seuss's or a software the
front RGB strip is directly linked to
the four zone RGB
keyboard backlighting you don't get
perky RGB here but the basic four zone
effect is nice enough the keyboard
itself has a bit of a spongy tactile
response I'd personally prefer something
more clicky but travel distance is
decent for this sort of laptop plus you
get a numpad and none of the keys are
truncated to fit it in the trackpad is
great and I love the inclusion of the
two separate click buttons well I
thought of gaming laptops these days
you're also getting a slim bezel around
the 15 inch display which keeps their
laptops footprint quite compact although
the still a sizable bezel below the
screen unfortunately a soos is gone
probably the worst webcam placement
possible offset and low below the
display I think it's slightly thicker
top bezel with the camera above the
screen would work better that sort of
design has been used previously with MSI
laptops this chassis is your typical mid
tier option it's not a slim and light
system like the asou Sepphoris but it's
not a chunky beast like some of the big
boys whose models it clocks in at 26
millimeters thick and 2.4 kilograms
heavy so it's somewhat portable but not
quite in that super portable tier that
comes at a higher price the main
limitation for portability will mostly
be the smaller 62 watt hour battery
versus near 100 watt hour units you can
get with systems like the Aero 15 I Oh
is very solid though 3 USB 3.1 type-a
ports 2 of those a Gen 1 one of those is
Gen 2 plus a USB 3 point to gen2 type-c
port there's no Thunderbolt 3 here
unfortunately you also get hdmi 2.0 B
that's full sized mini DisplayPort 1.2
Ethernet and SD card slot and a 3.5
minute or do jack internal connectivity
comes in the form of an Intel altitude
at 11a C 2x2 Wi-Fi plus Bluetooth 5.0
combo solution before talking about
performance here there's a few notes to
be make the first is relating to a suit
of software suite which is called the
armory crate there's all the standard
stuff in here but the important thing
are the fan profiles
windows silent balanced and turbo plus a
manual mode for game testing I used the
bounce mode because I didn't spot any
difference in performance between it and
the turbo mode for productivity apps I
did use the turbo mode though it's a
louder but does increase the power limit
on the CPU which for long workloads like
video encoding led to a small
performance increase however while the
turbo
is nice what's not nice is getting just
a single 16 gig team of ddr4 2666 memory
this means the laptop in its standard 16
gig configuration is running in just a
single channel mode which leads to much
lower memory bandwidth than dual channel
laptops and therefore lower performance
it does leave a dim slot free if you
want to upgrade to 32 gig down the line
but that's come at the cost of
performance for buyers out of the box
I'm not going to go into detail on the
performance of the core i7 8750 H
because I've covered it plenty of times
in other reviews it's a very popular 6
chord CPU used in most gaming laptops
and it's the option I'd choose for
productivity and gaming workloads
without getting into those crazy large
form factors the Zeus GL fiber for GV
performs roughly on par with the typical
Core i7
8750 H laptop that's down to a few
notable differences that both favor and
disadvantage the system due to the
turbofan mode longer workloads tend to
throttle less than standard 8750 H
performance so we're seeing up to a 10%
advantage for longer multi thread
workloads like handbrake this laptop can
sustain higher clocks for longer on the
flip side due to having single channel
memory this laptop gets disadvantaged in
our memory heavy benchmarks so that
includes seven zip compression MATLAB
and Adobe Photoshop serous blur it evens
out to being about equal to other
laptops but depending on what you're
doing you'll either see better or worse
performance so a bit of a strange one as
usual here's our comparison between the
core i7 8750 H and the last gen quad
core Core i7 7700 HQ due to higher clock
speeds and more cause we're looking at
over a 50% advantage in some
multi-threaded workloads as well as
higher single thread performance you
won't see this sort of improvement in
every workload but if you're coming from
an older quad core system the 87 58 will
be a notable upgrade this is the chart
for those wondering whether they should
buy a larger 15-inch gaming system or a
portable 13-inch Ultrabook for their
productivity tasks generally the 87 58
absolutely smokes a 15 watt CPU like the
core i7 85 65 you delivering more than
double the performance in some cases
throw in proper GPU acceleration for for
something like premiere encodes a gaming
laptop is an order of magnitude faster
comes to gaming I already have a full
video breaking down how the r-tx 2060
performs in this exact system so if you
want to see individual game performance
across a handful of titles plus an
in-depth look at this new laptop GPU
from Nvidia that video is what you want
to check out
however for that RTX 2060 review I
loaded up the GL 504 GV with dual
channel memory as it comes in the box
you only get 16 gigabytes of single
channel memory which has a noticeable
performance impact in most games so the
performance you see in my art X 2060
laptop coverage is better than what this
laptop delivers out of the box
on average the single channel
configuration of this GPU is 13% slower
than the dual channel config that's a
significant difference simply from not
having that second stick of memory in
there some games are barely impacted
such as dirt for watchdogs to and
Wolfenstein to others like prey
Assassin's Creed Odyssey and Resident
Evil to see a 25% performance cut or
more as the limited memory bandwidth
chokes these games there's no doubt that
dual channel memory is significantly
better for gaming at 1080p in terms of
an actual FPS impact in a game like
hitman 2 we're talking about going from
a 70 FPS average down to 50 FPS with
single channel memory in Assassin's
Creed Odyssey a 60 FPS experience is cut
down to just 45 FPS it's not a good
performance loss this also impacts the
margins between this RT X 2060 laptop
and other GPUs comparing dual channel to
dual channel the RT X 2060 is about 28%
faster on average than a gtx 1066
gigabyte but this single channel RT x
2060 laptop compared to a dual-channel
gtx 1060 system is only 12% faster and
is actually slower in some games and
then compared to something with the gtx
1070 inside again with dual channel ram
it loses by more than 20% leaving that
second dim slot free is a really costly
trade-off to make it easy for buyers to
upgrade their RAM in the future I have
to wonder how many people actually open
up their system and Chuck in that extra
stick surely the number isn't high
enough to justify cutting performance
for most owners what I'd have liked to
see is the laptop come with 2 8 gig
sticks by default that would
lead to much better performance from the
r-tx 2060 and for the small percentage
of people that one upgrades our 32 gig
in the future they can swap out both
eight gig Stix sold them or something
and swap in a two by 16 gig kit it's not
as good for upgraders but I take that
trade-off for better out-of-the-box
performance every day if you are
thinking of buying the GL 504 GP and
want to solve this problem you're
looking at spending $100 or so for a
second 16 gig ddr4 2666 sodium stick not
a huge cost but something you might want
to factor in looking at the cooling
solution nothing much has changed since
the last scar two models using the
balanced fan mode for gaming which
delivered the performance you've seen so
far the cooler is pretty loud under load
pushing up me 48 DBA in our testing it
also tends to ramp up and down a fair
bit while you're gaming so sometimes the
cooler is quieter than this figure but
to be honest the frequent changes are
just as annoying as running at the
maximum 48 DBA all the time however
temperatures are very good which
indicates the bounce mode is perhaps
ramping the fan up too high I recorded a
mere 73 degrees on the GPU and 83
degrees on the CPU in an extended
watchdog's to session which is well
below other laptops with similar noise
outputs i reckon some manual Fantini
would go a long way to bouncing out
temperatures and noise here for storage
amirev unit there's a kingston MTPA nvme
SSD with a 512 gig capacity this is a
mid tee performer not as fast as some of
the Samsung Intel SSDs i've seen used in
other gaming laptops but still fast
enough to deliver a performance
advantage over basic SATA SSDs
internally there's also a free 2.5 inch
drive bay if you want to add in a
further hard drive or SSD but
unfortunately there isn't an additional
end up to drive spot the display used on
this laptop is good it's not going to
break any new ground and you've probably
seen something like this in other
systems but it is a decent 15.6 inch
1080p IPS with a 144 Hertz for a fresh
rate peak brightness is up around 300
nits which is acceptable for a gaming
laptop and it has a contrast ratio of
around 1000 to one in terms of color
performance this is an sRGB display so
no fancy wide gamut here not that you
really need that for gaming my main
concern here is the incorrect
my point Susie's using approximately
7,500 K rather than the correct 6500 K
which gives the display a colder bluer
tone this leads to average delta is
between 3.0 and 4.0 which isn't accurate
but isn't hugely inaccurate either
against a gaming laptop so I don't think
this is really a significant issue so
that's all the data I have on the Asuza
ROG Strix car to GL 4gb honestly
it's a perfectly fine laptop it's got a
good design with a good trackpad a good
keyboard and good i/o it's got a good
display has good upgrade ability it has
good internal hardware and good
performance I won't say anything is
particularly special it's just your
run-of-the-mill mid tier gaming laptop
that's designed to be accessible for all
and deliver a decent 1080p gaming
experience for the most part I think
that's what buyers will get with the RT
X 2060 version of this system it's not
overly portable it's not overly chunky
it just nicely fits into that value but
not crappy laptop category my only major
concern with the GL 500 4 GB is coming
with single channel memory out of the
box it doesn't impact productivity
workloads too much but it does shave
around 10% off the gaming performance
you'd normally get from a dual channel
system it is fixable $100 sick of memory
added into the second slot immediately
gives you that performance back but I'd
rather that performance was included by
default however while there aren't too
many glaring issues with this laptop
itself the real downside is the price at
$1,800 us for this model it's very very
hard to recommend when you look at the
performance you're getting it's a lot
more expensive than gtx 1060 laptops
with a similar cpu display storage and
other components which retail for around
$1,100 or so these days so for 63% more
cash you're getting a system that's only
12 percent faster or 28% faster if you
add in a second stick of RAM it's also
not competitive with gtx 1070 laptops in
fact the predecessor to this very system
that GL 504 GS is only $1,500 right now
so that's 17% cheaper for a laptop
that's faster sometimes considerably so
of course laptop prices change a lot
over the months after launch so those
watching this review in the future will
be faced with a completely different
situation
it's
likely that gtx 1070 laptops won't be
available anymore and who knows where
this system will be priced among its
competitors right now it codes the exact
same price tag as other RT x 2060
laptops and without testing the others
it's really hard to know which is the
best choice other than to say that this
one we've tested here is perfectly fine
as it stands today to recommend the RT x
2060 sky 2 it'll have to be priced at
1300 to 1400 dollars which is a fairly
hefty price cut on where it currently
sits I definitely wouldn't be happy
paying $1,800 knowing that as far back
as the second half of last year I could
have spent $1,800 on a faster gtx 1070
system well before RT x laptops were on
the horizon and Pascal went on a fire
sale I just don't like the idea of a new
product being worse valued than
something last gen so the absolute
maximum I could justify for this laptop
is probably around $1,500 in a world
where Pascal laptops are no longer
available after you factor in an extra
hundred dollars to get dual channel
memory that would make it 11 percent
cheaper than the last gen gtx 1070
laptop for about 11 percent less
performance so a stalemate but a better
position than today's pricing I'm
honestly not sure who is responsible for
this price II normally I would say a
soos because they've made the laptop but
every other RTX 2060 system on Newegg is
around this price as well it doesn't
seem that anyone is able to make a
laptop with the same specs or roughly
the same specs for around that $1500
mark is that invidious fault for selling
the 2060 to OEMs at to higher price will
prices come down it's pretty hard to say
all I know is that it's not good value
right now and that kind of sucks that's
it for this review of the GL 500 4gb I
really wish I didn't have to end this
review on a bad note because technically
the laptop is quite decent I guess
there's no bad products just bad prices
