benchmark video this time we're looking
into the possible performance impacts
caused when addressing the two
now-famous security floors
mount down and Spector in my last video
I benchmark the windows update intended
to address the amount down of under
ability and I did this from a desktop
users perspective or more precisely a
content creator slash damer what I found
was virtually no impact on gaming
performance so good news for gamers and
there was also no impact for content
creators either what I did find though
were a few troubling results for nvme
storage devices and this mostly impacted
4k read performance since then a few
major tech outlets have also published
similar findings so those issues weren't
just limited to my own testing overall
though for a typical PC user or perhaps
more importantly at least on this
channel a gamer addressing the map down
vulnerability wasn't a big deal there
was however a second vulnerability that
needed to be addressed but that one
would require a firmware update or more
precisely a motherboard BIOS update
you've known that heard of Spectre by
now and this one is a result of a
fundamental flaw in the CPUs design as I
understand it and keep in mind I'm far
from a security expert we mostly test PC
games and relating hardware at harbor
and box but we're doing our best to
cover this topic because it could affect
our audience and benchmarking can help
us understand what the performance
impacts might be so as I understand it
because Spectre is the result of a
fundamental cpu design flaw it can't be
fixed at least not entirely and not
without replacing the CPU the firmware
update or the BIOS update mitigates the
problem but doesn't completely address
the vulnerability this is also still
primarily an Intel CPU floor it is
reported by AMD that one of the two
respective variants doesn't impact them
at all
while the other one does but is easily
resolved by a software update that
shouldn't impact performance in any
meaningful way variant 3 which is now
well known as meltdown doesn't impact
AMD at all and this was covered in my
previous video I'm yet to properly test
any a
DCP you so you'll have to sit tight for
a moment while we focus on a few Intel
CPUs since posting the meltdown
benchmark video we now have access to
BIOS updates and they do deliver the
microcode updates necessary to mitigate
the spectra of under ability and so far
this has happened on Intel's latest said
370 platform this update changes the
behavior of Intel's branch prediction to
be less aggressive this will likely mean
less effective branch prediction and
that means reduced IPC as the execution
pipelines wait for memory access more
often of course we will get to the
benchmarks in a moment but before we do
I just have a few more notes I would
like to cover right now at the time of
shooting this video the only motherboard
manufacturer to release an update is a
soos and so far they've only addressed
their Zed 370 series of motherboards
unfortunately I don't actually own an a
su said 370 motherboard believe it or
not I have models from every other brand
but a soos so that meant 48 hours ago I
raced down to my local PC store and
purchase the asou stuff Zen 370 plus
gaming for this test I then went back
and benchmarked the core i3 8100 without
the windows update and then again with
the windows update and then a third time
with the windows update plus the latest
BIOS update which included the micro
code update I've included some of the
updated core i7 87 arcade benchmarks as
well once you've installed the windows
update you can install a PowerShell
module called speculation control and
this will allow you to check if the
update has worked by typing get
speculation control settings with just
the windows update and still which only
addresses the meltdown vulnerability
this is what you'll see all three
requirements for meltdown
aka rogue data cache load are greenlit
and set to true for the branch target
injection aka spectra vulnerability only
OS support is present but not yet
enabled as we still require a micro code
update once the boss has been updated
with the required version this is what
you'll see ok so that's all the updates
we have so far it's time to run some
tests and see if there's any performance
penalties let's start with the core i3
8100 results oh and please note all
results are based on an average of it
these three runs first up we have the
core i3 Cinebench r15 results and very
little has changed here from the pre
update configuration we see less than a
two percent reduction in the multi
thread score and 1% for the single
thread score so that's pretty well
within the margin of error now this is a
little more interesting the windows
patch plus the BIOS update was
consistently three percent slower than
the previous test configurations please
note that lower is better for this test
as we're measuring the time it takes to
complete a render so the BIOS update
cost us nine seconds but as I said
overall a very minor reduction in
performance moving on we have Excel and
once again the Excel work load goes
unchanged we see the same six second
completion time so really nothing to
report here moving on we find the same
with the blender render test all
configurations took 58 seconds to
complete the test we also find no real
performance differences when testing
with veracrypt the aes encryption and
decryption results are all much the same
then we have some 7-zip results and here
we see no noticeable decline in
performance with the windows and bars
update applied the Geekbench for compute
test also shows similar performance with
the updates installed Geekbench also has
a slew of CPU benchmarks and each
category gets its own score as you can
see the crypto and memory scores are all
much the same we see a 3% reduction for
the integer and floating-point scores
with just a 2% reduction for the
multi-core score okay well it looks like
the applications and synthetic tests
didn't really give us much let's move on
to the games to see if they have any
scary numbers so here we are our first
game benchmark result and while things
don't look that dramatic we do see about
a 4% reduction in performance in the
core i3 8100 was consistently slower in
this test by a three to four percent
margin also for those wondering the
geforce gtx 1080i an insanely
overpowered GPU for the core i3 cpu is
used to try and remove the GPU as a
potential bottleneck and this gives us a
better idea of the impact the cpu has on
gaming performance for a slightly more
realistic test though we have boosted
the quality preset from medium teletraan
and again we see the same 4% reduction
in performance with the windows and bass
updates install
moving on we have ashes of the
singularity escalation and again we see
a three to four percent reduction in
performance with these updates installed
not a massive decline but a reduction in
frame rate all the same and again the
update configuration did consistently
come in lower even with the crazy preset
enabled we still see the same three to
four percent drop in frame rate
assassin's creed origins isn't GPU bound
heavy 1% low results with the 87 okay
for example reach around 90 FPS so all
these results certainly look GPU limited
I can assure you they aren't so that
being the case the BIOS update does
deliver similar performance to that of
the pre updated configuration certainly
within the margin of error even with the
ultra high quality settings enable was
still at GPU bound despite all three
configurations delivering the exact same
results I had honestly thought we might
see some larger margins in Rainbow six
siege but that wasn't the case in fact
here we see almost no difference at all
with the medium quality preset shifting
to the ultra quality settings doesn't
really change anything and again we see
that the BIOS update has no negative
impact on performance for this title the
results in f1 2017 also go largely
unchanged though this time we do see a
dip in the 1% lower results that said
it's nothing more than a 3% reduction
the same 3% drop for the 1% minimum can
be seen with the ultra high quality
settings
though again the average frame rates are
all much the same the last game that
I've tested with the core i3 8100 is
total Warhammer 2 and here we see a 4%
drop in frame rate for the 1% lower
result while the average remains much
the same than with the ultra quality
settings we see almost no change in
performance as all three configurations
provide similar results but what about
the core i7 87 ok how does it get on
with the BIOS update well all the
application and productivity tests were
all much the same so I'm not going to
throw a heap o graphs at you showing
absolutely nothing all over again so
we'll just move on and have a look at a
couple of games here we see that the
battle for one performance using the
medium quality preset allows for similar
1% low results while the average dips by
a 3% margin with the ultra quality
preset we see virtually the same results
the Windows Update actually boosted the
average frame rate by 2% which is of
course still within the margin of error
so
I wouldn't read too much into that
result using the higher quality preset
we see virtually no change with ashes of
the singularity this is also true with
the crazy quality preset enabled then
finally we have assassin's creed origins
and again the margins are very slim here
with the bios update enabled we saw the
1% low figure reduced by 2% well the
average frame rate remained much the
same then with the ultra high quality
preset name we'll be saying no
difference in performance at all ok
moving on what about storage performance
this was the only area where we saw any
real impact last time let's start with
the Samsung SSD 950 pro nvme drive on
the core i7 87 ok system here we see a 5
percent reduction in throughput for the
sequential write test an 8 percent
reduction for the 4k 64 thread write
test and a 20 percent reduction for the
4k write test this is also seen when
comparing the pre update configuration
to the Windows Update with BIOS
configuration read performance though
that's all pretty much similar across
the board it's just the writes that look
to have taken a hit moving on we find
some even more extreme results when
testing with crystal disk mark the
sequential read and write performance
all looks ok then we get to the 512 K
write test and well what's gone wrong
here a 41 percent reduction in
performance can be seen and this wasn't
a once-off deal I ran this test a dozen
or so times after multiple resets to try
and work out if it was just some kind of
glitch but every time this is the result
I got interestingly though the 512 K
read performance isn't nearly as heavily
impacted just 8% reduction here though
that's still certainly very noteworthy
then when we move to the 4k queue depth
of 32 we did find a 10% drop for both
the read and write results the single 4k
wrap performance is also reduced by 19%
with the BIOS update while the read
throughput goes unchanged I then decided
to do some testing with a toe disk
benchmark and hautboy what has gone
wrong here both the sequential read and
write tests took a massive hit and again
throughput was reduced by as much as 40%
with the BIOS update enabled so if this
has happened to nvme SSDs what does this
mean for your more run-of-the-mill SATA
SSDs then
well here's the Samsung SSD 850 Evo 2
terabyte with the core i3 8100 and here
we do see some declines again the
sequential read and writes for the
crystal mark test they do look ok in
fact they look quite good the 512
kilobytes read and write performance is
also very good this time the 4k queued
at 432 results though they do see a
small decline of around 3% so nothing
too alarming that said though we do
still see some big hits for the 4k
transfers which is interesting writes
dropped by 27% and reads by 19% then
again we have some auto gist benchmark
results and again we do see some
performance drop-offs here oddly though
this time the read results don't
actually seem to suffer but the write
throughput certainly does here we see up
to a 17% reduction in write performance
with the BIOS update applied and that's
certainly a note where they drop off for
a SATA device ok so we've got a bit to
talk about here I want to start by
saying please take those storage results
with a grain of salt at least for now
until they can be confirmed as at least
one other reliable source I wouldn't go
too crazy over the potential performance
impact here I'm not sure if this is
something we're gonna see others
reporting or if this is just an issue I
ran into with my particular hardware
configuration I have though come across
a test done by guru 3d which does show
up to a 33% reduction in performance
with the Samsung SSD 960 pro 2 terabyte
nvme drive and this was for the 4
kilobyte Q depth of 32 test so that's
somewhat in line with what I saw they
didn't test with outer unfortunately
though they did also test with a sous
motherboard so perhaps it's an issue
with your sous bias update and they'll
battle address that or possibly this is
just what the band-aid looks like as
always though time will tell I should
also note that I was able to revert the
bass back to the previous version and
doing so did restore the original SSD
performance horrible storage performance
aside we constantly saw less than a 5%
reduction in gaming performance you're
probably looking at more around a 3 to 4
percent drop and that's when you are CPU
limited less of course when you are GPU
limited SSD performance that doesn't
really impact framerate so we've seen
this in the past when comparing slow
hard drives to Oh
snappy SSDs is really nothing again
there we're a drop in storage
performance can hurt is with the game
load times and this is something we'll
dive into in the future should our
storage figures prove accurate of course
then we have the more commonly used
applications like Excel and 7-zip for
example which seem unaffected using
either the core i3 8100 or Core i7 8700
K processors and we found a little too
note impact for those doing content
creation type work as well but what
about older CPUs you know your wells and
bridges and older 45 nanometer
processors well as it stands right now
we can't actually test those it's
possible to test the impact of the
Windows 10 meltdown patch but it's not
yet possible to test the impact of the
big one Spectre
for this we need BIOS updates for older
motherboards supporting those CPUs when
or if we get them at all is a bit of an
unknown at this stage we haven't found a
motherboard maker that really wants to
give us the inside scoop one thing is
for sure though this is a mess of epic
proportions and it will still require
further OS and past updates this is
really just the start to close these
security flaws it's also just the start
of Intel Spain already there are three
class action complaints that have been
filed against Intel over these CPUs
security flaws their potential impact
and also Intel's response time to
address them Intel can no doubt expect
to face further lawsuits as well and not
only are these security risks a serious
issue but the impact addressing them has
on businesses it's also very serious as
another example before I switched my
attention to focusing on this BIOS
update I was waist-deep in benchmarking
fortnight I've got another one of those
40-plus GPUs showdowns in the works
anyway I bring this up because on the
last day of testing I was running into a
few login problems which was quite
unusual for fortnight the issue was I
often had to wait 15 or even 20 minutes
before I could get into a game and that
is just a load the game which point I
would run my tests shut it down install
a new GPU fire it up and Sharaf had to
wait another 15 or 20 minutes to get
back into the game so I quickly gave up
on that and thought I'd give it a shot
later when they addressed whatever the
problem was and I'm here
under testing something else at the time
though I do remember thinking to myself
this is just a day or so after the
meltdown exploit started to get
addressed wouldn't it be funny if that
was the reason for the busy servers well
turns out not that funny because that
was the exact reason or at least this is
what epic games are saying for the login
issues
soon after the login problems began that
the fortnight team made a post on the
epic games forums as they wanted to
bring the issue to the community's
attention explain what was going on
turns out the updates required to
mitigate the meltdown vulnerability
we're slowing the server's down by
causing massive spikes in CPU
utilization and at that point they had
just patched a single service and that
one cost CP utilization to triple they
also know that there's more painting to
come but they'll do their best to manage
the situation no doubt we're gonna keep
hearing stories like this as more
companies update their servers over the
coming days and weeks anyway I'm gonna
wrap this up as it has no doubt been a
very long video so thank you for
watching the whole way through if you
did there's certainly more testing that
still needs to be done and are you gonna
see what others find when it comes to
the storage performance that's obviously
an area to focus on for now though your
frame rates look pretty safe and
applications that aren't storage
sensitive will also perform much the
same as I've said much more testing
needs to be done but I've been chipping
away at this for two days straight now
with almost no rest so yeah it's time to
get some rest and see what others dig up
