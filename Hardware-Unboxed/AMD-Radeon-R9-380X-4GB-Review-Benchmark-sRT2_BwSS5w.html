I'm your host Matt and today we'll be
uncovering and benchmarking the new
Radeon r9 380 X if you're currently
shopping around for a new graphics card
for less than $300 your options are
pretty limited assuming you can't afford
or simply don't wish to spend $300 on an
i-9 390 or GTX 970 then you're limited
to $200 options in the r9 380 or gtx 960
that $100 price gap is pretty big and
normally we expect to see a $250 option
for example last generations r9 280 or
gtx 760 to round out 2015 AMD will be
releasing another 300 series graphics
card today the Radeon r9 380 X and you
guessed it this is the new $250
candidate if you checked out our gtx 960
versus r9 380 head-to-head comparison
where we tested over 20 games you'll
know that AMD currently offer the best
$200 graphics card and that being the
case we expect big things from the 380 X
so what's under the hood
based on the GC and 1.2 architecture the
380 x packs 2048 SPU's 128 ta use and 32
ro PS this is the same core
configuration as the 280 X and therefore
the Radeon HD 7970 both of which used
the original GCN 1.0 architecture a key
difference of the 380 X when compared to
those previous jeep uses the 256-bit
wide memory bus which is also used by
the standard 380 and Radeon r9 285
before it however unlike the 380 the 380
X will come with a 4 gigabyte of gddr5
memory based configuration as AMD isn't
just targeting 1080p gaming with the 380
X but also 1440p AMD has slapped the
same thermal design power rating of 100
and 90 watts on the 380 X as they did on
the 380 and despite that we certainly
expect the beefier 380 X use quite a bit
more power
the default AMD specification calls for
a core clock speed of 970 megahertz and
a memory speed of 1000
125 megahertz which provides a data rate
of 5.7 gigabits per second it should be
noted that the 256-bit wide memory bus
limits the 380 X to a memory bandwidth
of just 182 gigabytes per second the
same memory bandwidth of the 380 and a
far cry from the 384 gigabytes of the r9
390 for testing we used to make sure
pretty new games including fallout for
Mad Max
The Witcher 3 Batman Arkham Knight and
battlefield 4 although battlefield 4
isn't new the game is still very
demanding and visually impressive it
also serves as an excellent base line
given drivers have had plenty of time to
mature and it's commonly used for
benchmarking initially we plan to throw
in some call of duty black ops 3 results
as well but Judas and performance
anomalies between the 380 and 380 X we
decided against it
the latest beta driver showed massive
performance gains for the 390 and 380 X
over the standard 388 there's definitely
some funny business going on there
rather than risk artificially skewing
the results we dropped the test entirely
Batman Arkham Knight is a questionable
addition to our battery of benchmarks
giving the game trouble history still
today it seems to be in a playable state
we certainly didn't run into any issues
when benchmarking Batman features its
own built-in benchmark but it doesn't
accurately represent real gameplay
instead we use fraps to measure 60
seconds gameplay while driving the
Batmobile around the in-game quality
settings roll max down was the exception
of the Nvidia game work settings which
include interactive smoke interactive
paper debris enhanced rein and enhanced
lights are the Radeon r9 380 air has
over 72 frames per second with a minimum
of fifty nine frames of
man arcanite making it six frames per
second or nine percent faster than the
380 that said it was a whopping 29
percent slower than the 390 which worked
out to be a 29 frame per second gap to
bench my father field for we're using
perhaps to measure 60 seconds of the
opening sequence of the campaign sixth
level of kashgar it's a very demanding
section as it's fast paced and features
plenty of draw distance numerous
lighting effects and shadows high
resolution textures as well as particle
effects from fire and smoke
anti-aliasing has been set to 2 times
msaa
and the HB AO ambient occlusion mode has
been used all other settings have been
maxed out testing with battlefield 4 we
again find that the 380 X is just 8%
faster than the 380 while losing to the
390 by a rather substantial 28% margin
as it falls short by 25 frames per
second I've only just purchased Mad Max
and therefore haven't had time to play
through the game to work out where I
should benchmark that being said for now
I'm testing with 60 seconds of the intro
cutscenes the game doesn't appear
particularly demanding even with the
quality settings maxed out the 380 X
blitzed Mad Max up to 81 fps though this
meant it was just 8% faster than the 380
and 960 graphics cards while it was
again miles behind the 390 losing by a
24% margin fallout 4 benchmarking takes
place in the small town of Concord where
we use perhaps to measure 60 seconds of
gameplay the ultra preset was used for
testing which means taa was enabled
along with features such as SSAO and
godrays an average of 68 frames per
second meant that 380 X was 13% faster
than the 380 and 10% faster than the GTX
960 meanwhile it only trailed the 390 by
more respectable 14% margin this time
around for testing The Witcher 3 we
benchmark 60 seconds of gameplay in the
large town of novigrad the maximum
in-game quality settings we use which
meant that Nvidia hair works was enabled
and set to the maximum level currently I
am the Adam video delivers similar
performance with this setting enabled
here the 380 accents good for 38 frames
at 1080p with all the eye candy turned
on this meant that the 380 X was 9%
faster than the 380 but crucially 21%
slower than
390 next we test the power consumption
while playing Battlefield the 380 excess
consumption was very high certainly much
higher than we were expecting it's
difficult to compare the efficiency of
non-reference cars as voltage profiles
are often changed causing certain
graphics cars to consume more power this
could very well be the case with the
Sapphire 380 ft nitro OC whatever the
case the sapphire 3 DX consumes roughly
the same amount of power as the HIAS r9
390 in battlefield 4 and considerably
more power than H is 380 interestingly
this sapphire 9 285 was also quite
power-hungry the power consumption
figures in fallout 4 were quite similar
to those seen when looking at
battlefield 4 the standard 380 consumes
a bit more power here which helped to
reduce the huge margin between the 3 DX
and 380 although overall the story is
much the same with the bulk of the AMD
300 series in a video GeForce 900 series
graphics cards have you already been
released it's quite clear where the 3d X
slots in and how good of a job it does
so how good of a job just do exactly
well that really depends on the price
initial estimate suggests an MSRP of 250
dollars though we find that hard to
believe given the 380 X was an average
just 9% faster than the 380 and over 20%
slower than the 390 this means the 380 X
is an incremental upgrade over the 380
and given the performance we've seen a
$220 asking price seems reasonable the
380 X is a fairly poor job of bridging
the gap between the 380 and 390 s so
$250 price should be out of the question
on paper the 380 X features 25% fewer
SPU's and the 390 so isn't entirely
surprising that we found it to be on
average 23% slower something I found
interesting and wanted to share with you
guys was how the 380 X compared to the
almost four-year-old Radeon HD 7970 a
graphics card that features the same
core configuration the 79 70 years of
the original GC &amp;amp; 1.0 architecture but
features a wider 384 bit memory bus for
288 gigabyte per second memory bandwidth
although the 380 X features are slightly
more efficient GCM 1.2 architecture is
256 bit memory bus limits the memory
bandwidth - just 180
gigabytes per second as you can see
performance wise the old 7970 and 380 X
have rather evenly matched the only game
to show a significant difference in
performance is fallout 4 although we
don't believe the 380 X is actually 24
percent faster here rather AMD is yet to
optimize the 79 seventies performance
something they've obviously done in
other recently released titles such as
Mad Max Batman Arkham Knight and The
Witcher 3 so essentially if you spent
$500 on a 7970 almost four years ago it
seems your graphics card is only
devalued by 50% not a bad investment if
you look at it that way getting back to
the 380 X we'd hoped for more
performance but looking at it
realistically the 380 X was never going
to be more than 14% faster than the 380
the specifications simply wouldn't allow
it
so keeping expectations in check the
Radeon r9 380 X is a mild bump up from
the 380 offering slightly better
performance at 1080p AMD is hinting at
1440p performance with the 380 X but we
feel it's a little too slow for that
leaving the 390 is the best option for
the higher resolution finally if you're
in the market for a 200 to $250 graphics
card right now we suggest you try and
snap up one of the remaining r9 290 s
incredibly there still seems to be
plenty of them out there and right now
you egg comm is showing stock for a
sapphire r9 290 or $220 after $20 rebate
performance wise you can expect very
similar if not the same numbers to that
of the i9 390 as we've demonstrated in
previous videos thanks for watching
another Hardware box release day review
did you have high hopes to the 380 X let
us know in the comments or f4 my
