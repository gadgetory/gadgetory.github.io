laptop review actually it's probably
more of a laptop versus desktop type
content creation video anyway the topic
isn't important what you should be
focused on is the fact that I'm going to
make you watch the entire video like
this well that intro probably hurt my
watch time but whatever we'll make do
with whoever's left right so for this
video we'll be taking a look at the msi
GS for TVR 7re phantom pro yeah from
this point forward let's just call it
the phantom pro despite the fact that
you now think it's a quadcopter from DJI
and on a laptop from msi but anyway
technically the laptop was announced
late last year so it's not exactly brand
new though the revision I have is
relatively new late last year msi
released the six re model which featured
the Scylla kokoro 7 CPUs and that model
has been recently updated with the 7 re
version that I have and as you probably
guessed that has the kb lake core i7s
anyway if you saw my unboxing boxes
episode 27 last week you'll know why I
have the phantom Pro on hand and for the
sinners who missed all the unboxing
action let me fill you in next week I'm
headed to Taipei for Computex thanks to
msi who have sponsored the channel part
of a sponsorship deal included a laptop
to create videos on well as overseas and
for that msi has sent along a light and
very compact phantom pro the unit weighs
just 1.8 kilograms and measures 345
millimeters wide 245 millimeters deep
and as thickest it's just 23 millimeters
on paper the laptop looks great for what
I need it has a snappy Intel Core i7
7700 HQ processor and although this is
the base model it's what you'd expect to
find in a compact 14-inch flagship
laptop so those wondering the 7700 HQ
has a base operating frequency of 2
point 8 gigahertz with a maximum
survivors frequency of 3.8 gigahertz
although that is a decent downgrade in
terms of clock speed from the desktop
variants you do still get all 4 cores
with hyper-threading for 8 threads the
level 3 cache has been downgraded from 8
megabytes to 6
and this is how much level three you
will find on a desktop core i5 processor
out-of-the-box you also get a very
snappy Samsung sm9 5:1 256 gigabyte nvme
SSD of the boot drive along with a
secondary 1 terabyte hard drive it's a
travel star 7k 1000 which has a 32
megabyte DRAM cash and a 7200 rpm
spindle speed for a 2.5 inch driver -
rather snappy MSI is also thrown in 16
gigabytes of dual-channel ddr2 400
memory the screen is a beautiful 14 inch
IPS panel supporting a resolution of
1920 by 1080 and it offers exceptional
image quality with great viewing angles
perfect for video making the only
consumer I did have with the screen was
whether the 1080p resolution will be
enough for aging videos in Premiere Pro
but as it turns out everything fits well
enough driving the display is the
geforce gtx 1066 q bite model and i'm
keen to see how this thing performs in
game shortly though I will save that for
another video soon for now I want to see
how this laptop compares to similarly
configured desktops for content creation
that said they let me start by saying
the laptop versus desktop argument is a
little bit pointless laptops are of
course purpose-built to be portable
while desktops are designed to be set up
and used at you guessed at a desk and
from there most really move so if you
need a computer for creating videos
while on the go a laptop is the only
solution the question though how well
does something like MSI fountain Pro
work and this is the very question I was
asking myself heading into this week as
I prepare for Computex when working from
home my editing area is powered by a
core i7 69 50 X which is a 10 core 20
thread processor it's a bit overkill for
Premiere Pro and its price is quite
horrendous but getting sidetracked I
also have 128 gigabytes of ddr4 memory
so I'm not expecting MSI's little laptop
to deliver that kind of performance
still I'm very interested to see where
the Phantom price performance positions
itself on the desktop landscape so let's
go find out before jumping into the
Premiere Pro CC testing let's quickly
run a few other tests first up we have
the memory bandwidth test and here we
see the Phantom Pro is good for roughly
25 gigabytes per second that places that
on power
the core i7 7,500 and the reason for
this is both configurations were tested
using ddr4 2400 memory this means memory
bandwidth is down more than 20% when
compared to the Intel systems running
the faster ddr4 3,200 memory not really
a shocker though given the difference in
memory frequency and there really isn't
anything msi could have done about this
as the HM 175 does limit memory support
to ddr4 2400 so let's move on and see
what the Intel Core i7 7700 HQ has to
offer in terms of rural performance
using Cinebench r15 MSI's phantom pro
was good for a multi-threaded score of
seven hundred and three points and this
place the core i7 7700 HQ just ahead of
the core i5 7600 k which is quite
impressive and not far behind the
horizon v 1500 X the higher clock 7700 K
was 34% faster but that's hardly
surprising as we were comparing a 91
watt desktop see for you to a 45 watt
mobile part one thing worth noting
though is the single thread performance
is well down on even the 7600 K and
again this has to do with the clock
speeds in fact the 7700 HQ is only able
to add you at Core i5 7500 before
jumping to Premiere Pro here is a quick
look at the 7-zip performance again we
find the Phantom Pro and at 7700 HQ
process I find themselves situated
between the 7600 K and the horizon 5
1500 X desktop processors which is quite
impressive given the size of the laptop
ok so now we have the Adobe Premiere Pro
CC exporting or encouraging rendering
performance for this all-important test
the Phantom Pro was able to overtake the
rise in 5 1500 X making it faster than
not just AMD's new quad core but also
the much higher clocked KB Lake 7600 K
when compared to the rise in 5 1600 X 6
core 12 thread CPU the Phantom Pro was
26 percent slower running on the mains
power but that's not actually that bad
it was also 32 percent slower from the
core i7 7700 K that said though it is
worth noting when running from the
internal battery the rendering time is
increased by 23% and now the Phantom Pro
is only slightly faster than the locked
core i5 desktop system still for truly
portable performance that's still very
impressive so what took the core i7 77
ok
just four minutes takes the Phantom Pro
laptop five minutes this means for a ten
minute long
4k 60fps video the laptop would take
around thirty two and a half minutes to
complete the render the core i7 7700 K
enabled desktop system should take
around 26 minutes so in contrast I feel
the laptop isn't that bad and given the
convenience of being able to render on
the fly I feel like that isn't much of a
performance penalty before moving on to
the battery testing here's a quick look
at how long the Phantom Pro takes to
boot up from a cold start
as you can see it's extremely snappy
Thanks that mbm a SSD which is great as
it won't keep you waiting for long
allowing you to quickly get back to work
or play The Phantom Pro comes equipped
with a four cell 61 watt hour battery
which offers a reasonable run time
though I would say this is one of the
weaker aspects of the laptop watching a
movie in airplane mode for example with
the brightness set to 50% the battery
did drain in 4 hours and 15 minutes
still that's long enough to watch a
movie but it's not quite as long as I
would have hoped for meanwhile the PC
market battery test did run for just 2
hours and 36 minutes though this is a
much more brutal test still you won't
want to venture too far from a power
outlet speaking of external power the
unit comes with a rather large power
brick particularly for such a compact
laptop that said as you've just seen a
laptop does pack quite a punch
so it shouldn't be totally surprising
that it runs on a 180 watt power brick
weighing 480 grams before I wrap things
up there are a few other noteworthy
items I'd like to mention on the rear
you will find a mini DisplayPort which
will support 4k displays then on the
right side we find a type-c connector
which is a bit of a jack-of-all-trades
supporting USB 3.1 gen2 Thunderbolt 3
and DisplayPort this means it's actually
possible to connect up to three external
4k displays to the phantom pro using the
type C mini DisplayPort and HDMI output
other connectivity options include a
type a USB 3.0 port on the right side
and then over on the left side we have
another type a USB 3.0 port SD card
reader - 3.5 millimeter audio jacks full
sized rj45 Gigabit Ethernet connection
and a DC power input overall build
quality seems very nice and there are
plenty of aluminium trimmings which give
the phantom pro a very premium feel the
lid and chassis are reasonably sturdy
for such a thin laptop and I really like
the lid design even with the big red
dragon logo I feel still looks very
classy though it also opens up very
nicely thanks to some quality hinges and
inside we find a very slick SteelSeries
red backlit chiclet keyboard which
actually offers very nice feedback well
it's very comforting to know that I
won't have any
editing and encoding my Computex
coverage next week on the msi gs4 TV r7r
a phantom pro the fact that i can render
a 10-minute 4k video and around half an
hour is great news and i do plan to
deliver at least one new video per day
for you guys finally as always there's
just the issue of price currently it can
be purchased in the US for $1,500 which
does seem quite reasonable though I
should mention that the American
shoppers only get the 128 gigabyte SSD
at that price there are options for 256
gigabyte and even 512 gigabyte models
though I'm not totally showing what the
pricing is there any way down under
we're paying 2700 Australian and
considering basic gtx 1060 enabled
laptops come in at around 2100 ozzie
that's not a bad premium to pay for
what's on offer here with this very
compact package still if the Phantom Pro
is a bit rich for your blood then there
is a bigger Apache pro model with a 15.6
inch screen and that has half as much
memory for 2300 Aussie anyway that's
going to do it for this one I'm keen to
put MSI's phantom pro to work next week
and hopefully I'll be able to create a
heap of really cool content for you guys
until then do stay tuned because I have
a big rx 570 vs GTX 1060 stringing about
comparison and the works and that will
be coming later in the week I'm your
host Steve see you again soon guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
