well welcome to our stream we're gonna
drink some drinks what a-what do we good
jump straight into it
well pretty much me we hear it all we
have keV from check showdown drinking
drinks with us as well say almost forgot
yeah I'm used to just having Tim here
yeah fair enough
yeah so we got a whole bunch of drinks
here we also got some snacks as well
which we'll check out as we go through
we're not sure I mean some of them we
can tell what the drinks are by the
pictures but some of them we have no
idea what they are so mystery mystery
drink so we'll just have to see and you
know but we have someone here that can
translate them we've got a translator
little stream professional stream so
including the the ironing board mousepad
first well you cannot see the ironing
board but it is yeah there's not
anything by Twitter and you'll see
there's a picture of the you retweeted
didn't you yeah yeah there's a picture
as well and sweater so you guys can
check it out but um it's a good use of
space actually perfect mousepad slash
bench oh it's great
so we're here obviously in Taipei in
Taiwan we have Computex 2080 we've
having a great time I'm sure you've
checked out all the content on both of
our channels and yeah it's been fun show
so far wrapping it up sort of at the end
of it we're definitely wrapping it up so
we're not doing anything today we've
pretty much done all the filming we had
a few more things to edit I've got a
couple of other fun things planned but
we thought let's do a live stream we got
keV here and we went to 7-Eleven topped
up on if we've got have quite a few
strange looks last night Tim and I when
we spent over 20 Australian dollars on
but it's crazy right because all this
cost like roughly 500 Taiwanese dollars
which is the equivalent of 22 Australian
dollars or something which is like 18 us
and we got 15 drinks for that much like
in Australia this would have cost a lot
I don't even know a lot so I don't worry
a lot of comments about my butt legs
here yeah Tim's got his legs out Steve
was like you should put on some pants
and I was like but that's not necessary
just rock the pants oh good how we
synched Sam voices are saying yeah I
think it's yeah it might be a little but
yeah shouldn't be too bad
yeah it's some of the last few times
well yeah it's better than what we faced
the first time we tried to live
streaming out a week ago yeah so yeah so
hopefully everything's going fine well
we should probably crack into one of
these drinks yeah your question is where
do we start good start with that one so
I was at the oatmeal drink oatmeal drink
you have an oatmeal drinky oh so safe to
start with then I just move the Michael
a little bit you're a big proponent of
oats and way thank you see good morning
actually do we have to shake this up and
are you probably probably sure we don't
want to get freaking just walk out water
all right got some PASM are shaking
noises
well that is thick
well that is thick hang on um can we say
yeah yeah yeah that is thick almost as
thick as Steve is now tasty why did we
invite I knew I would regret this okay
so we've got a little bit one else just
pretty item of oats
it smells like porridge yeah right
smells I'm sorry yeah yeah yeah it does
cheese cheese mate
no shoes yeah oh it's like drinking part
it is like drink I taste like nothing to
me
yeah it's just it's like orange doesn't
really taste much like much does it
it's kind of like thick water yeah thing
it's thick water with like a strong
flavor yeah I think the flavors even
that strong I mean I'm committed to
drink whatever is poured out in the
glass bed I would not choose that again
ah I don't mind it so that is the
Chinese characters oatmeal drink also
we're not rinsing the glasses well we
have no way to rinse it so that's pretty
thick yeah I guess
don't pour too much though because it
was something disgusting any enacted now
you have to you have to that's that's
the rules of this stream some of the
guys in the chat says did you meet up
with other tech youtubers like Brian
from tech est for example we've seen a
lot of youtubers we ran into Brian on
the first night but we haven't really we
haven't run into him on the showroom
floor and I think so yeah
didn't he's as far as I can tell running
all over the place because he's done a
heap of content yeah so if you guys
haven't checked that out go check it out
but yeah we've run into a few of the
u.s. guys but no what we saw Paul a
couple of times really nice guy always
great running into Paul yeah didn't run
into Kyle we saw him but he was really
busy so we left him alone
same with Steve from games Nexus we saw
a look pretty he was using the thick of
it so we thought we leave him alone but
yeah would have been good yeah chat with
him at Taipei 101 we briefly ran into
the guys from Hardware can axis yeah so
friendly I mean you've seen a fair bit
of Wendell haven't you yeah well good
haven't got to chat with Wendell so yeah
hopefully we do but we might be running
out of time
yeah so yeah lots of fun stuff yeah so
what should we try next
you know give that money go what is that
I don't know I bought it because I could
not tell what it was I think it had we
sometimes get it vitamins say you don't
get her to tell her ass after okay cuz
then we can just try to figure out what
it is first
well we'll try that one then okay it's
got vitamins or something
whoa that could have gone badly no but
it's it's uh it's carbonated so did we
meet - we saw him briefly coming to a
party that we were I thought we didn't
actually speak to him or anything he's
usually pretty busy he's always around I
think I gave myself a bit too much there
Linus was motoring through it I was when
I was at the msi booth he was there just
going crazy with a laptop so yeah oh
look at the color of this yeah I know
it's like blue yellow looks like
Mountain Dew yeah kinda I'll put that
over here yeah move that up your board
rejection
okay just smells like soft drink kind of
no it's like a CC Lehman worst yeah it
does yeah
that's actually quite nice that's okay
yeah it's not too sweet which is good
yeah it's very much like CC lumen yeah
same thing I like Altima so far it's
been quite disappointing for me I want
something that I it's very unusual we
know we have one or two unusual ones so
we have some crazy stuff the stream
won't disappoint have you been following
the chat I have been a little bit
someone asked what who are the winners
and losers of Computex this year that
was Sal Karin is one of our patreon
refer to our previous video that Tim
didn't yeah exactly that's exactly what
I would think so winner is AMD and loser
is Intel yes just like no two heavies
about it the shredder is looking awesome
I'll have a video coming up with the be
quiet booth and I checked out they have
an upcoming big air cooler for of the 32
core thread repair rising sooo that's
very droopy - I saw your video did the
coolermaster the right ripper yeah the
way so a similar sort of baseplate not
yeah so it's actually gonna be coming
out you know obviously it would go
straight into the x3 99 platform which
is good and it's looking awesome whereas
Intel's basically unlocked 8180 Xeon
which is yeah well I mean though
apparently there was supposed to say on
there at their event there was an
overclocking demo and their practice to
say it but they just didn't oh is that
this is their excuse so I'm not sure
whether it's true or not I'm not buying
the iron ii I don't know why if they're
reading they knew exactly what they were
doing and it was it would have been
playing probably and I would have been
executed exactly as intended but yeah
yeah whatever
I mean it's just so bad like every all
of us guys and enthusiasts just saw
straight away like twenty eight cores
five gigahertz
that's just not happening oh yeah we not
coming to anything yeah we didn't bother
jumping on it cuz we're like this is
nothing so yeah exactly
I suppose the thread Ripper launched the
next day
announcement rather made it something so
yeah yeah I was worth covering it's the
motherboards are crazy as well if you've
seen some of the ones they've shown off
for the four which one's the 28 core
until oh oh yeah yeah yeah 34 yeah well
it's a zero it's a platinum Xerox
they're just server boards it's just
yeah to transfer it I mean what power
connectors are you gonna run for the CPU
then because it's looking like they're
gonna need more than two eyghon so what
are you gonna buy it's two power
supplies yeah it's not happening
anywhere never walls yeah yeah all right
you want to read a few things while I
sort out the next one
yeah sure this one's not particularly
crazy but it could taste interesting
water lemon milk so the melon milk it's
watermelon and milk so it's you know
what a melon juice is okay it's a bit
but apparently it's milk like no it's
not it's not juice misprinted no it
never is whenever they say milk they
mean milk Tim and I found that a few
times so we'll give this a go what was
your favourite coming up product um I
think if we exclude thread Ripper what
was your guys for everything that you
saw
that's like coming up soon well it's I
mean if it was a single product of
something that was just really cool for
it lighting Tim so I wanted to check out
that MSI motherboard the x3 99 creation
that was like a beast that was so cool
to check out yeah I actually forgot
about that when I was think that was
cool now it's really good base yeah
that's a really cool board I'd love to
get a second gen thread Ripper chip on
that yeah I think that I really like the
Coolermaster angled mount that was
amazing there cases it's just yeah it's
something unique it will really add to
people's builds make it look that a
little bit extra it's not at all
practical but that doesn't matter cuz
that's not the point of it yeah that was
really interesting cool nice - had a lot
of really cool things so check it out
watch our video ya know they they had a
lot of good stuff yeah I mean it was
mainly the stuff that interest to me was
the new cases coolers yeah oh really
weird colour yeah shit milkis it's
it's definitely millville that's a
strong smell yeah putting a bit of this
in I like the gschool RGB memories with
the royal stuff yeah really cool that
looks pretty pimping here probably
pretty expensive I reckon they said it
will be a premium over the RGB stuff
that they've already got tim is actually
doing a video on that we got a lot of
cool b-roll oh it smells exactly like
watermelon juice it smells exactly
exactly like watermelon juice so cheers
mate oh it's good oh no that's horrible
yeah I'm not a fan it's me it smells
like watermelon juice but it tastes just
like milk like there's no watermelon
flavor in it
yeah I mean it's not disgusting but it's
it's weird that's for sure yeah you're
gonna drink all that leather rules
don't disappoint the fans oh I wanted to
take milk to well we've got a ton of
milk drinks here so just don't kick over
everybody duck away - uh yeah um yeah I
mean you know just got the Kiwi away
it's it's a it's unusual did anyone else
find the entire Computex show to be the
year of mild increment in the industry
yes yeah not a whole lot of major things
on show we saw well we said that on our
patron livestream that we did before the
show started wasn't it I kind of
remember now the weeks are blur this
week has flown have you found that yeah
yeah like I feel like we just got here
yet you just wake up go breakfast jump
on the train get to the showroom floor
do everything get back at it and then
it's 10 o'clock at night and then you
want to go out and do something and then
just go to bed so yeah it's been a
absolute whirlwind but I I think it's
been I don't know don't want to say
disappointing overall because there has
been some cool products and some good
announcements yeah but probably hoping
for a little bit more yeah I think on
that string we were sort of talking
about maybe in AMD would refresh x3 and
9 9 2 x4 no you know if it seems like
they're just going straight for there it
was three nine I mean or continuing it
that would have given us more to talk
about but I don't know what that was
that was your water in case you needed
but I'll see ya it would have given us
more to talk about but it's a bit like
the be 450 situation where it's just
rehashed motherboards yeah yeah
hopefully a little bit refined but it's
not radically different on you yeah it
reminds me of what Intel turd with x99
when you when they the new CPUs came out
that was when they went to what
Broadwell board well II wasn't it from
PES well II and they stayed on x99 yes
yeah and so all they did then is all
their companies what we'll see with
thread Ripper two will be the same thing
there'll be ones I'll bring out so to be
you know motherboards X 399 for thread
Ripper to so the creation like the
creation and obviously there'll be other
all the other companies will bring ones
out I don't see a reason why they
wouldn't I'm starting to see why some of
the X 3 9 9 boards we had before were
built so overkill like 16 cores and then
now we're sort of like saying like okay
so now when you put a 32 core in them
they'll actually be able to handle it
because I was thinking with some of the
other ones they were so over built for a
16 core which was you know that in
itself is still you know pretty crazy
thing but now we're seeing that that'll
be good that you can put the 32 cores in
so if you are a person that is on thread
Ripper right now you will be able to
just upgrade your CPU do the boss
updates and stuff
there are fuming having to go over yeah
there are a few extra annoying boards
that might be right on the edge
I can't imagine will be much
overclocking Headroom but as far as
crazy as to saint angelo 399 board yeah
just multilevel the ones that didn't
seem to be overkill previously yeah yeah
a few come to mind and that they would
be I think yeah you're not going to be
able to overclock with them or anything
like that but um they're definitely been
all these new ones that'll be made for
the 32 core chips and they're like the
creation which will be crazy so I think
what Tim said when we did the previous
stream the patreon stream was quite true
in the sense that there was before kombu
ticks has started and Tim said that um
a lot of the big things are probably
gonna be quite disappointing you know
from the big companies that was before
the Nvidia event and stuff like that or
I think was the same day of it and that
that's pretty true and that we found a
lot of the cool things we found were
things that we weren't expecting though
we went in there there were just sort of
singular things maybe a monitor here
maybe yeah yeah you know cool or
something like that often happens at
Computex and so we we found a lot of
cool things that we didn't expect but
out of the big companies Intel Nvidia
AMD well AMD did you know they did a
thriller of two announcements that was
good but are the other two you know not
really much and even Intel's one was
mainly you know talking about other
things and then they just sort of tapped
on the twenty-eighth core which and then
they gave pretty much no information
about it anyway so yeah no I totally
agree that's sort of the problem with
Computex it's such a massive show and
you make all your meetings well in
advance because companies are busy and
you've got to sort of fit yourself in at
certain times and yeah yeah so you don't
get it to go see everything it's not
like going to a theme park and just
running around and checking it it
probably is if you're not having to
create content of it if you're planning
on because when you go to a booth they
sort of section off parts for you so you
can actually do filming so people aren't
walking through your shots every two
seconds to make that happen to him we
could make a conservation of the bangs
even when I'm there right there talking
or Steve's talking and the cameras like
a meter away yeah and it's really
obvious we're doing attacks this someone
will just walk straight through the
middle busy section easily go around and
it's like snot who cares this guy
squeezed between Tim and they it was
like that much distance he's gone
straight through Tim was about a minute
into he's that's what having at the msi
booth when i was doing the interview
with someone from msi guy called jeremy
it was a really nice guy and i asked him
to come in on the video to talk about
that that x 399 board and the camera was
here only like a meter me and a half
away and someone walked by in front of
us while we're doing the interview then
turned around and walked back passed
through the camera and it cause you know
that's it doesn't bother me that much
because I don't really get stage fright
at all but when you have these people
that aren't used to being on camera it
really you know
some way someone wrecks the shot yeah
yeah and it rattles them a little bit so
that was frustrating so we had to redo
the whole thing
how's the audio going I think for some
people the audio seems slightly out of
sync and for some people it seems okay
I'm just doing very minor change when I
was watching your stream last time I
noticed it was depending on what browser
you were you watching in okay and if
sometimes if you refresh the browser
yeah fixed it well I've tried -50 I'm
gonna go +50 and yeah they say it's good
now okay so because I think yeah the
camera the delay from the camera is just
very slight yeah well let's celebrate
with a new drink I believe this has come
by that might be the brand come by yeah
it says come by on it oh we don't try it
first sorry I keep forgetting the rules
apologies
yeah we can't cheat yeah no cheating
here yeah I knew this would happen at
some point today vis screwing up the box
he's absolutely wrecked it I salvaged it
with our shell milk like that and give
it to you in school
back in like the 19th it's not my fault
it was a dud all right yeah I'm not the
dad okay here we go oh this is very
liquidy well and kind of clear that's
mixing with the original art very nicely
thank you I think I fixed the audio sync
so thanks job thanks for letting me know
about that I knew there's a reason we'd
bring Tim yeah yeah oh that's just wrong
I don't know what that smell is
oh that's definitely got a smell to it
yeah absolutely
it's like definitely taste oh yeah
that's very strong on a very strong SEC
oh it doesn't taste like tea that much
it tastes kinda nice it's good that good
that is very surprising based on the
smell even someone like me that doesn't
like tea they like taste like it it's a
very overpowering the smell yeah but
it's quite sweet like it's it's nice so
what what is this come by we've got a
translator off-screen here in orange tea
okay well that was disappointingly good
yeah
well we're four down we've got eleven to
go your pull smaller glasses do you guys
need to mix them together well maybe
that could be the grandfather this think
that's gonna have to happen let us know
guys are we going for the hour the mix
of all together at the end yeah if we
get if we get a massive donation we'll
probably do it I reckon but we'll go for
it anyway
uh-huh well that was that was actually
quite nice that was probably uh not too
bad
out of the ones we've had so far that
was the best I reckon
yeah yep I agree well I was hoping to
run into something very own use it gonna
be interesting how we're gonna get there
for liquid out of those but we'll wait
till we get there you got some snacks
there keV get a bit hungry yeah we got
some snacks as well and we don't know
what they are yeah all righty
oh that's weird grab some they're like
french fries or something right like
those yeah you get the french fries in a
packet yeah they're quite good there
okay ones enough for me to place Tim
know they don't really favorite and
worst case from Computex
we didn't see a whole lot of variety on
cases so like I said we only sort of
went to the appointments that we made so
I guess if we were a more case focused
channel we would have gone and seen all
the cases but we saw some nice
coolermaster cases they were good
Corsair had a couple of cases but most
of them we just sort of already seen the
280x
looks interesting I don't really know if
I like her or not did you get a good
look at the 280x no not really
usually it hmm I've seen it but it's
kind of a yeah I don't know I'll reserve
judgment on that one just yet obviously
the 1000 d was there with an awesome
open-loop system or two
you know liquid cooling I'm gonna do
mine soon hopefully with heat no yeah ek
I think yeah yeah PK yep no no I know
what's going on I was talking with two
other companies previously but now we
went with ek in the end so we're still
working that out it's a lot of bits but
that should be good um so a lot of cool
moderate cases a lot of cool yes there's
always a skill so you still had some
great ones yeah so a good juice go video
coming out in a couple of yep yeah maybe
tomorrow
you see all that cool stuff so yep
definitely
there was a did you see it the is it
called s in core s incor yeah they had a
cool one there the Stormtrooper
first-order fractal define our sex I
made a video about it so my channel that
awesome builds one and that was really
cool but they had the weirdest choice of
CPU the good old 76 40 X all right keep
it low kicks yeah do people buy those
that had so yeah I had to have been
sponsored by Intel right yeah there's no
one's buying that well yeah they've
discontinued that yeah yeah yeah well I
think they just wanted it because I
wanted to put all the RGB memory in yeah
eight slots and it was like the cheapest
I got you 4x 299 so I can't even use all
the memory slots though yeah um so that
was an interesting choice there yes yep
your G school video is gonna be very
funny the end of it yeah it's gonna be
good so stay tuned for that one yeah I
did razor do anything at Computex they
had a booth right in the back corner
they didn't show off anything and
Logitech wasn't there either Logitech
doesn't a lot of the companies here are
mainly based in Asia like trying our
time on that sort of area whereas
Logitech is kind of more outside of that
area so not really a big show for them
yep
yeah well I suppose today we had the
option of getting the camera running
around the showroom floor and trying to
see as much as we could as quickly as we
could but it is it is very packed and it
is quite difficult to do that so we
thought we'd just do the relaxed
livestream after the long week that was
sort of short flew by is too
yeah I thought those setters Tim wearing
boxers like I don't easier these are
legitimate shorts apparently I knew this
stream would get a lot of short related
questions so how am I gonna what how am
I gonna get this out what it's gonna be
the easiest way to do this we got a
knife or something
just pour it out through the hole well
that's what I'm going for now but it
could yeah this could get messy
so what's this one gone I know that
works all right I have no idea what this
money this is just to you I think Steve
- urinating a sumo devil mm asks what do
you think will be the next RGB thing all
we have on the patron livestream Paul
from Paul's Hardware ruined this for me
the patron livestream on was at Monday
or Sunday I don't know whatever we did
it whatever we did it I said someone
asked what are we expecting to be RGB
this year and I said I'm calling it now
we'll be dust filters definitely RG is
that oh definitely RGB dust filters and
I thought everywhere yes definitely
that's fine
that's my one yeah RGB dust filters I
thought Coolermaster had done it but it
turns out they faked it yeah it was just
a panel that had a TV but it looked like
a dust filter anyway I thought it wasn't
them Paul from Paul's out by carries
like you know that's not a dust filter
my go away Paul you're ruining my fun
my jeans are fine oh man you've made
such a mess that was always gonna happen
we've only got two more Prima's to go so
yeah I need you to change your pants yes
sir RGB condoms would be interesting but
so everyone seems to think I mean
everything in the computer case can
practically be RGB except dust filters
these days yet SSDs Ram motherboards
coolers fans if they make lighting
strips instead of making them like the
black sort of material they may come out
if they
them clear and then put like an RGB
border that would that would that would
do it yeah I caught it as definitely
going to beat them to the punch on that
one
next we'll have RGB liquid for inside
liquid coolers they'll somehow manage to
do that
yeah like project light down your Ives
yeah I guess will they try to do that
thermaltake did the RGB pressure
fittings okay so if you use like a clear
liquid that kind of works so smells I'm
not sure this is very strong I don't
know what I was like has to be another
day it's very very strong say Steve try
fish it's um
definitely sweet another one it's quite
it's got a bit of a strange kick to it
that's just mediocre yeah nothing good
about this one it's very weird so this
is one that we've got no we can't tell
what it is
Oh nope t so I should people love this
so this is a standard drink well yeah
not not something I'd enjoy too much
quiet taste probably yeah it tastes a
little bit like it has a kind of coffee
taste at first to me I liked the other
one weird aftertaste
I liked the the orange one but that
one's a bit yeah a bit weird aftertaste
definitely yeah yeah initially it's like
oh that's not - oh hang on what's going
what's going on there
but the thing is it's it's sweeter than
then like if you made tea and just put
milk in it that must have added sugar or
something condensed milk okay make sense
now Oh Tim stomachs gonna love there oh
man I'm just gonna be chucking my guts
up later from all this it's why I'll be
editing our gschool video and just
running it back and forth from the
toilet I'll film it with the GoPro gonna
be hectic um yeah a few RGB think I mean
RGB is okay because you can turn it off
yeah and something the chain was saying
like I would really rather not pay for
the RGB I think it's definitely gonna
get to a point where like
you'll be able to buy non RGB options
because people have that opinion even
MSI with their latest monitors one of
the new features this year was like you
can buy a cheaper model without RGB in
it ok because people obviously like it
costs more money to put it in there so
yeah I mean the RGB monitor thing is
yeah it's you know that's been going on
with the keyboards for ages I mean
Rockettes new keyboard they're bringing
out soon there's gonna be two there's
three models of it but um yeah you can
pay I think it's gonna be about twenty
dollars u.s. less for the non RGB model
then for the RGB one and that's Ducky's
been doing that for a long time as well
but like blighting ones or no lighting
ones you got a backlight got our
backlight on a keyboard it does make
sense because if you were you know but
it doesn't have to be RGB no yeah it's
kind of annoying enough I don't know if
you have a red or a blue color and that
doesn't really fit in with your theme
they're bombing yar don't really care
Jared I feel sick just watching this
yeah well good old Jared's laptops why'd
you be honest did you buy oh sure
they're easy yeah they did they add the
same thing like the clear cover and put
a few LEDs in it and I'm loving the fact
that so many of the i/o shield to come
in pre-attached cuz you guys always say
say on my channel when I do builds and
stuff you're like why do you why do I
never put our shields on and it's cuz I
I hate it it's so frustrating no cutting
myself it's the worst step one of a
build Irish shield and gives like nap
skip step one well it's not just me I
mean Steve ik game is Nexus doesn't
never use them as well and it's just
because it doesn't do anything and well
it matters yeah it's I mean
theoretically it stops yes if fart no
well also if you like plugging if you
like reaching around you're plugging in
like it straight to the side of the vrm
or something but most of them ruin out
all of the gaming ones have like plastic
housings around the i/o it's not like
the olden days really yeah but yeah you
go in and hit the plastic housing and
then go down and short something on the
bar I mean the dust perspective like all
right through it would only go yeah I
don't think it's a dust shield it's more
of us stopping metal cables from going
in there like USB yes or whatever
regardless it's nice a few of the
motherboards I've checked out lately
have them on and it's good seeing them
actually down on the lowering once -
yeah it's just handy do you just you
know it's just I'm also a pre-installed
ones for sure you just whack it in and
nice and easy you don't have to be
fumbling around trying to get the thing
in it so it's so frustrating that with
RGB these days it's like every
motherboard manufacturers their own
connector and you have to like either
get ones that are appropriate for your
board or use adapters in that sort of
stuff I think they're getting a lot of
backlash over that because a lot of I
saw I sort of started to notice this
year that a lot of them were more
Universal stuff or they were really sort
of advertising you know work with a
wider range offering multiple ports on
it yes exactly I pin or for pin one yes
yep so that's a sort of a good question
back here do you guys think the 32 core
through three is going to outpace the 28
core Intel CPU well what it's hard to
know what that 28 course if he's gonna
be well we don't know what the clock
speeds will be either again we know that
80 180 is at two points to point
something 2.5 or 2.7 gigahertz base
clock on that so I haven't really even
entertained the idea because if they do
do it then is they say it's coming in q4
as what a high-end desktop CPUs well
they didn't say what it was but they
said that this this CPU is coming to the
market yeah at that point as a $10,000
server chip probably high-end desktop
though well you know how expensive it is
gonna be on the high-end desktop
probably pretty expensive it won't be
over take it won't be ten thousand now
they have huge profit margins on the
enterprise CPUs yeah they'll disabled
some memory controllers and disabled or
the enterprise features mmm and clock a
bit higher and charge a suite for tuned
for it oh my does it have to be yeah I'm
just interested how they're gonna do
these motherboards
like for to fit them in with the amount
of faces and stuff to get it it's just I
don't know how they're gonna do it no
well they don't need that many phases if
they're not doing an all core 5
gigahertz well they can't they can't I
start kind you don't need you don't need
that many phases if you're not running
it'll be similar to the thread Ripper
ball yes my point being though is that
if they're showing that the
Hertz is capable then if they're like
right so they'll be our special
overclocking edition ones that basically
they sell the packages all I thinking as
people would buy it with the intention
of trying to get 5 gigahertz on all 28
cords like people not like an average
person but someone that's a real
hardcore so overclock or something like
that and to have it in a desktop PC so
they're gonna have to have a pretty
beefy motherboard to handle that but
it's got to be in a small package it
can't be this huge they've only shown
the huge Sivir yeah I think it's like
now hey what you would sale is like a
Dino pig so it's good for running
Cinebench in 15 seconds or so but you
would only build that system so like
maker renders or encodes I read oblique
quick there's no way that that system
that showed off we're talking that load
it would be it would crash I go to you
I'm crashing under a longer load I'm
certain well will interrupt this
discussion with something more pressing
we have peanut rice milk yup read that
right don't pour out so I'm gonna put a
little I'm gonna put a fair bit in for
this one only because it's not a prima
it's a lot oh yeah that's that peanut
milks nice and thick so there we go
I let you off lightly there I'm gonna
put a fair bit of this in for me wow
that is a straw I'm gonna fish I'm
committed
do you like pain no it's just the
weirdest one we've come across that
that's an extremely strong only not
smell I'll let you two bailout lightly
oh Jesus you're right is so strong I
could regret this it smells like peanut
butter yeah yeah like a tub I don't even
like peanuts that much bottoms up yeah
oh yeah that is bad yeah that's horrific
oh if you guys have a wondered what it
was like to drink peanut butter drink
for your god peanuts but that is
next-level
am I gonna do with the rest of this just
you have to drink it all gallon in one
go and then it's nonsense only so hard
not to drop f-bombs on this on this live
stream but seriously this is worth an
f-bomb is that bad oh man I'm have to
sip this here we go
what is the best way to go about this
scalped oh yeah taste it once voted this
should be just banned from life I really
hope I don't throw up just do the whole
thing in one going near beer right I'm
sorry I self up
alright let's do this keep going keep
going keep that's what we've resorted to
stay for the views country oh that's
nasty
that's so bad oh I'm already feeling it
like so bad like it's like a concoctions
like brewing something like you know
weird mix oh all right well it's worth
it that one's probably the worst one so
far yeah our take my worse I didn't I
actually quite enjoyed some of them but
that one was well alright let's chat for
a minute well that settles Oh drinks I
know I'm not gonna be up for lunch ah oh
we were talking about your area for
something that yeah that's worse than
Intel's demo yesterday I was got stomach
ripping oh um
Tim's got the chair I'm gonna need some
any snacks - it should be called Kim I
don't know if it's a I don't know how
I'm a good idea it is getting snacks I'm
really bad with milk based drinks like I
just yeah where's the bag of snacks that
we bought yeah I don't know my channel
take on box you can't even open a bag of
chips
oh that's just lazy this is yeah the
chip that's just regular chips no they
just oh now they're not the regular
flavor though oh it's gonna pick you up
like Bobby's stuff
they're regular tips hmm they're
actually quite nice now get rid of them
they're too good I hope they have gas
masks ready and spare toilet for tune
okay I'm so happy I'm not staying here
poor old Steve duh yeah I like another
room so these are actually they're just
nice chips pop bulgogi isn't it yeah
you're right does have a bit of a pork
flavor yeah get rid of the nice chips
that's that's not gonna work
what are we yeah I mean I think at this
point we've pretty much established that
the Intel thing was extremely misleading
at best so yeah that's just not
happening I don't know what they're
gonna release what it's going to cost
but you know yeah they're IMD's put them
in a rough position that's for sure this
is a great question from Soundwave
scientist do you guys think risin 7
nanometre will be ahead of Intel even if
Intel gets their 10 nanometer out that's
I think a lot of you guys so what do you
want you can explain well I think yes 10
what Intel's 10 enemy is different from
yea what aim Dee's doing yeah the the
metrics aren't equivalent 7 animators
isn't necessarily better than 10 enemies
or vice versa because they it's really
confusing what the nanometer actually
refers to in the trip and companies
different fabs use different metrics for
it so yeah the thing is we are getting
rise in 7 nanometers sampling at the end
of this year for release early next year
and same with Intel 10 nanometer so it's
just it's interesting to see what will
happen there in terms of who gets their
volume production on those two different
processes out first and I reckon rise in
7 an immediate will come first I think
will come first I think even when Intel
does get to market with theirs they're
going to hurt for at least the first
generation I would have guessed but you
see
man I kind of need to get on to another
drink after that we need something
that's guaranteed to be okay that's just
cider isn't well we'll leave the
asparagus juice that's the grandma I
think those two are the grand finale
those two there can you just imagine
though because Yuri said that we're
gonna mix them all together think that
asparagus is gonna be mixed with the
peanut oh dear now we can't mix them Oh
mix them and just make well I'll do it
I'll do it you two are I'll do it
Channel alive with your antics anyway we
get views these days we have to do this
once a week now yeah I don't know
so this is body talk on it let's do this
is that what you thought was safe so
well I don't know I just picked up yeah
we'll give it a go Body Talk it must be
some our translator is sending us some
strange signals here she's laughing so
it must be terrible Edward before yet
this Edward asked how long do you think
it will take Intel to shifter the
multi-day approach no we've made a
mistake here
oh that looks that looks disgusting what
you police her much you're gonna for
yourself more that's about the same
that's the same I might even have a bit
another milk face one yes oh god Tim
might know I don't think Tim will see
the end of this stream based on what
I've seen from Tom nice Christ it
doesn't have a strong smell but no it
smells very unusually though it smells
very weird fibre soul that's what it
says on there too you are gonna just be
smashing the toilet after this stream
okay it doesn't taste like anything
it's like weak milk is yeah really pissy
milk as a weed it's gonna we'd smell
them and it just tastes like sort of
yeah really mild
it tastes like em do you have the light
blue top milk and Australia it's like
yeah it's fine it smells on you it
smells bad at maybe it's just because
like I just cracked this may be um yeah
it smells nasty in there
oh yes like that's oh yeah right smells
nasty in there that's real bad oh yeah
how long do you think it would take in
total shift of the multi dye approach um
we've seen them already working on their
email for vague their Vega thing you're
doing there Rhys okay be like gee so
that we already know they're working on
a multi dyeing connect into connect
technology so it seems that you know
they've already applied that for GPUs no
doubt they'll be wanting to apply that
on CPUs as soon as possible yeah
but yeah they're working on just like
you know Amy's got infinity fabric I
think the Infinity fabrics a bit more
flexible but I hope Center on that do
you want to stick that over there like I
I cannot drink this much milk this is
just gonna be terror I don't think
there's any more is it juice this is
this is a milky this is that a brown
rice got some good cheese juice it's
mostly juices you through the tough
stuff Tim okay and I don't else milk
yeah that looks milky so this oh maybe
not that's very water a little out in
the bottom that looks interesting that
one we're seeing a lot of comments on
the latest few videos of guys or some
viewers saying you know you guys are
avoiding discussing the fact that AMD
are using a multi die approach whereas
Intel isn't there 14 tells us vastly
superior and all that sort of stuff we
are seeing a lot of those comments let's
talk about that because it's an
interesting point well it's not yeah I
suppose it is a point now but Tim and I
were just were discussing of the day and
it's just the way the future you're not
going to see those huge monolithic dyes
anymore or at least oh yeah yields on a
28 core CPU that size of so down errific
yeah so bad that's one of the reasons
why have to charge so much yeah and the
thing is like with CPU design of course
it's better to have like the best
approaches to have everything as close
as possible on the one die using super
fast interconnects
but a lot of things that a CPU does are
things that don't necessarily require
the other CPU cores to be right next to
each other so things like memory access
the infinity fabric is way faster than
memory access yeah so even if you're
having to go to multiple course across
infinity fabric or multiple dyes it
doesn't actually matter that much for
that particular workload yeah obviously
thread Ripper 2 will be a little bit
disadvantage because it has to go
through a different dyed access memory
don't like an epic CPU there's not a
whole lot of disadvantage
the only problem you get is you know if
cause need to talk to each other there
might be a bit of extra latency between
the dyes but we already see that with
Rison with their CC X approach it's
basically exactly the same thing just
split into multiple dyes exactly I mean
this is where we're gonna see the big
benefit with AMD going from what we've
already all talked about with Verizon to
is from 40 nanometer to 12 nanometer
that is horrific it's fine keep going
ignore me the latency reduction in the
way that the CCX is communicate to each
other to put in a basic way has been
reduced to a large degree and that's
gonna really benefit thread Ripper - oh
yeah that's gonna be the biggest be the
biggest benefit with Ripper - because
yeah obviously that scales up as you add
more and more of these that the CC exes
yeah and it's not just that like you
know but as these as multi die continues
to be a thing we're gonna get faster and
faster memory which is going to improve
the performance of that interconnect
yeah so as we move to like ddr5 you know
Amy's gonna have a huge advantage say I
like our Steve's genes and now fancy but
but there's just so many spots all over
the people asking can you use multi die
for GPUs I think it's also suited to
that I think it's better suited
yeah because GPU is already really wide
and got lots of different yeah
processing pipelines in there so yeah
well so you'll be seeing that before too
long I would have thought yeah I just
think with thread Rupa - that's gonna be
AMD like already with the first thread
Ripper
they clawed back a pretty decent chunk
of the market I would say in the h EDT
space and I think thread repeaters just
going to expel like whole quite a good
lead then I
yeah I don't have exact sales figures
but it seemed to me at least that skylax
didn't do very well and wasn't
well-received well the problem with sky
kicks was that they're high because of
their super high margins for server
chips they can't suddenly release a 16
called chip that is super affordable
because but I think it's more the fact
that we've had the thread Ripper
competition because you look at the
previous generations like Broadwell and
stuff and they weren't they weren't
great value yeah but what I'm saying is
that like Intel can't release a chip
that surprise as priced competitive with
thread Ripper as mvk yeah it's like Amy
you can release a sub $1000 16 core CPU
and Intel has to look at their server
chips that make most of their money and
be like well if we cut down the price of
our multiple thousand dollar 16 cords
it's also the fact that they're gonna
get badly need eyes out of a wafer yes
ie even though like a scalar case chip
has reduced features compared to theirs
eons there are some server companies and
some applications where they don't need
the extra features and they would just
buy that instead yes so they can't they
don't really want to you know cut down
on the massive amounts of money they're
making from those so they're being
forced to though basic well they
basically are and that's that's why
competition so awesome with AMD at the
moment yeah yeah it's really good I mean
I've spoken to you guys when I've
interacted with you and my comment
sections and asking about what you guys
run and yeah so that's been interesting
and yeah you're right like not that many
people have really gone to sky cakes the
most popular one I would say you guys
matter notes as well would be the 7900 X
because it was in New Zealand anyway it
was about the same prices in 1950 X yeah
obviously it's a teen core but it had
those good clock speeds so it could've
went toe-to-toe with the 1950 X the only
issue with it was the heat was just
ridiculous you would need you could
delete it but D letting a $1,500 New
Zealand CPU to me just seems outrageous
but you made a video you had to use
custom water cooling just to cool the
thing yeah yeah so it ran so much hotter
so in there in the real world scenario
especially if you're building it for
station you're obviously not gonna buy
something that's runs that hot all the
time if you're doing rendering all day
you know like picture editing all day
and it's you know high CPU load you're
not gonna be looking for that so you
just pick the 1950 X cuz cooler running
and all the rest of it and I think a lot
of our audiences or viewers in our
audience rather we're buying those
platforms to game as well yeah because
they're their workstation CPUs but the
Broadway Lee for example is was good at
gaming yeah but now that you've gone
from the ring bus to the mesh you don't
have that anymore that low latency so
it's sort of not really a great or even
yeah it's definitely not a good gaming
CPU so this 7900 X was better at gaming
I found in the 1950 experts purely
because of the clock speed advantage it
had a lot of my testing it still came
out on top but in the rendering test
they were almost forever that had a lot
of gaming issues early on that still
doesn't need to really be configured to
be good for gaming yeah yeah thanks but
hurt Beluga $5 superjet sake juice we're
on box let's get to this next we have
another juice where to unbox and it is
bubble green tea with this is really
popular it's not really popular so I
think this will be good yes males like
tea I have nothing else I can tell you
about it but we've got 20% extra free so
good deal on that yeah it's probably
cost a dollar or something like most of
these running out of room on your own
smells very much like tea again you can
tell all the tea drinks they yeah it's
very strong very strong tea smell to
them don't lose their peanut butter milk
there
yeah that's quite good that's okay I'd
have that again yep you're gonna have to
finish this I'm not drinking the megamix
I'll have a go see that's quite good I
don't have to I have to edit one video
today so maybe make them megamix but you
know so it takes it up but then we all
just have one sip of it rather than
drink a whole thing no you're not
sleeping at a my cup yeah Steve all the
SC is give the disease but the the at
least that way you know a little bit no
drink no it's it's all in or nothing on
this stream keV there's no easy way they
are gone I'm leaving here after you're
gonna your stomach especially with that
peanut one what we've essentially done
the same thing by sipping them all it's
what do you think it goes do you think
your stomach just like segments them all
well we're doing it one at a time I just
got in the bubble tea it's he was doing
it when a taste of drinking them all
together is gonna be it and the place I
can't white oh yeah well that was that
was good that was good that one what are
we laughing at rustling yeah catch us up
on the comments a lot of people saying
all rise and ships support ECC that's
kinda you know so yeah a thread right
video horizon other lanes changing for
threads or is still gonna be sixty plus
for the PC islands I think I think it's
the same because the extra two dies
don't have additional sixty plus four
yeah so the extra two dies that they've
added are basically just cause
everything else is - causing cash yet
that's right $20 trim says $20 super
chat for Tim to megamix oh we need that
money to me get home well they've done
it two dollars so if you donate 20 no
I'll think about it but I'll have to
make a video of me chucking my guts out
later from the megamix yeah I should
have played this up more to make some
money out of it yeah that's that's two
dollars not twenty dollars you sneaky
shit yeah that's
no he's gonna give you the other 18 when
you do it it's a $2 upfront offer two
dollars upfront yeah change with the
mega makes happen yeah yeah that's how
I'd play it and tip but I I really don't
want to do a lot of it I'll do like I'll
drink the whole glass you full up yeah
full up well you have to fill up this so
much yep yeah the whole thing I'll try
to anyway I think you should mix all the
drinks into one thanks Jodi tech channel
for supporting us could be good
benchmark juice might work well yeah
might be the fastest editing you ever
done any word on thread rippers second
gen RAM support will we get 4,000 plus s
and just in Paris no way I dab in
pushing so officially we don't know we
weren't though because well they haven't
released any official information memory
support on three rip is not going to be
great because you want to just populate
all those dims or a lot of them because
first of all you want quad channel
memory support but it's a workstation
platform so you're not gonna go with
less than 32 gig of ram so you're gonna
want yeah yeah so 4,000 I mean you can't
get that on rise in the second gen so
but I'm aware of not what the sticks
I've got yeah so the more thousands just
out of reach and forth and so now maybe
yeah I've managed to 3630 but I'm sure I
was done 3600 as well but then even when
you manually tighten up the time because
it's still not as good as 34 yeah so at
least with the sticks that I've got
enough someone else's tested something
that I haven't come across yet and it's
a lot better yeah so if there is let us
know and we'll get our hands on it and
try it out but yes far as I know 3400
with the nice tight timing seems to be
the sweet spot and it won't be any
different for thread Ripper you won't be
running okay yeah actually I don't want
to say because I could be completely
wrong I don't know until we get it
tested
oh yeah I mean I imagine whatever memory
support is on the second gen like 2,700
X it'll be at best of that yeah I agree
I mean you're not gonna go from I mean
it's basically using these same dies so
they're not gonna suddenly have better
memory support no no we're no obviously
the boards will be really high-quality
yes that using that yeah just
unfortunately not gonna be half
I think you got a bet just sing Jarrod's
comments he said I can only run my Ramba
2666 with my but how many 250x I've
that's pretty low I'm as pretty low I'm
with I've got try it in Z memory eight
sticks and that's as far as mine goes as
well really
I managed 3000 on mine with how many
sticks of RAM for yeah four maybe I
don't know how many Jarrod's your I've
I've populated all slots this guy here's
got 3,200 with trident Z I assume he's
also got it should do what Rison does it
should do the same but then if you fill
all the memory slots it'll do the same
as what Rison does with fully populated
dims so sex sack cunts it don't know
what that is says I do guys think Amy's
gonna go hard on improving memory so it
was then too it seems seems like from
what games Nexus has been reporting that
Amy's go they were really hard yeah they
really have presented - yeah so I think
yeah games next has been reporting a lot
on AMG working really hard on ddr5 and
the it's obvious why they do it makes
such a big difference to their infinity
fabric running at higher speeds that
they've really are they're gonna be
right at the forefront of all memory
tech from now until forever pretty much
that yeah that could be huge or probably
will be but again we'll wait and see
yeah I mean Jarrett's only running four
sticks as well so I think that's just
depends on what the sticks are those
yeah yeah exactly did Lisa Sood not say
that tr2 is going straight to 7
nanometre
um no February 2 is 12 nanometer the
same as rising 2nd gen but Lisa's did
say that epoch 2nd gen is going straight
to 7 nanometre yeah so we're not going
to get like the epoch on 12 nanometer
they'll just continue to exist and then
at the start of 2019 we'll start to see
epic as Amy's first 7 nanometer chips
yeah yeah exactly
you guys get a little bit confused
because there's and it's understandable
so Rison one your first generation
raisin that was just Zen now we're I'm
rising to that Zen plus and then when
Rising 3 comes out that will be is in
two so yeah it's a little bit ok Tony
has donated 20 pounds so that is well
above the $20
some boys everyone downs a good amount
of the megamix yes I'm gonna throw up
my megamix is on yeah Magus drops crop
can add a good question then I think
that's something we've talked to Kate
about do you think b3 16h 370 will
support the upcoming 8th Corps from
Intel yeah so we think the eight core is
not coming now I think it will become
this platform do it well do we think
it's coming on the platform or not my
theory this is a pure guess I don't have
any information
III agree is that so Intel struggling
with 10 nanometre and the original plan
would have been after they delayed to an
enemy that the ninth-generation series
will be 10 nanometre and they'll go all
out they'll release everything new but
recently well earlier this year they
said we're struggling with 10 nanometre
it's delayed we're going to do another
40 nanometer as nice gen yeah my opinion
and my theory is that the eight core CPU
that's been rumored is is the ninth gen
desktop CPU line yes it'll be called the
9700 K whatever yeah I never really said
390 as the new platform alongside it
yeah so well if all they might Reno I
think they'll go to the 400 series am I
really so this is pure speculation Tim
and I have no idea we don't have any
inside information we're just making
this story up but yeah we think because
coffee like was moved to six cores so
you went from KB lake with four coffee
like six and in the ninth generation
will be eight so I think that's what's
going to happen so they've delayed that
and that will be what is going to happen
they're open no we're not doing tech
channel is gone I really think you
should make your drinks rock paper
scissors and the loser drinks a full cup
well we're probably will be drinking a
fair bit of the mega mix with these
donations I think we have to have a
toilet break in a minute we'll have to
like tag it up we've drank a fair bit of
liquid here so we may have to go one at
a time who's in charge of the drinks
I've been giving you guys a lot less
Steve I'm glad you know I'm glad you're
not in charge of the drinks you know
come on you can do it
why are they so hard to open this one
looks pretty small
oh so this is what this is guava juice
that stuff's good it Sam I don't like
them they like I don't know oh I know I
know it smells good I like it hmm
okay let's do a little bit of this
because I'm not cane
you're not keen mate how much of this
peanuts rice milk did you drink and you
don't want to drink actually nice guava
juice I'm not justifying anything yeah I
love it
okay he's great best one yet by far yeah
that is actually pretty good
hmm all right I'll take it back I'm glad
I gave him a little bit if only we had
jurian juice oh my god durian is
horrific and people say tastes good and
I tried it and no let's discuss it
tastes like sweet onion all right add it
to the pile what was that
nice mixing really bad she did the other
toilet Danny he can't get off stream
start over on the street you know ask
yourself you guys don't understand we
went out to dinner last night and Steve
picked a restaurant
it was fine you didn't have the burgers
no I had squid know I had the burgers
okay so it's just you it's just like I
woke up this morning and I felt like
there was something wrong and then all
this mix is just making it worse
you have a few you call tonight do not
throw up we need all the donation and I
throw up on Steve well this is the last
livestream we doing yeah no it's not the
taste the taste is fine this isn't a mix
like because I don't drink milk much at
all now like I I probably have it I
haven't drunk milk in like the last two
months I would say no because I'm
intolerant just because it doesn't sit
well and then I've just had like all
this mix so you want to sit for a minute
before we have the next time oh yeah
yeah we were rest of it um I'm really
surprised good I I'm always the guy
feels sick instantly from like even the
slightest dodgy food or anything I just
go straight like that six straight away
I'm sorry I can't even some time and
then maybe it all start hitting you
Andrew says he's done it a 10 Canadian
bucks thank you very much
grab some bees to cleanse your palates
after megamix yeah we'll go out for
lunch and grab some well we probably
can't stomach some tomorrow I think EV
we'll be moving too fast anyway we'll
have to go get food and bring it back
here for him Darren said already spent
all night chucking my guts up watching
you gag ain't helping harder the Friday
night in Australia are you Jared I hope
you having a good time let's have
someone lets us try some of this okay so
food I am yeah grab a few of these this
is the one we're trying and we've got a
fire on it is it spicy
mm-hmm a little bit yeah it's kicking in
a little bit not too bad I wouldn't
describe it as fire no no they're not
like spicy yeah well actually rather and
hold on for the next 20 minutes I'll be
back in a minute
oh yeah I'm taking it real easy oh it
just feels Yannick feeling the wrong yes
they're just like I doing some water
yeah good plan I can watch me struggle
in the stream for the next 10 minutes
trying to get these drink bottles open
have you eaten this morning yeah I
breakfast oh well I haven't eaten at all
I haven't eaten yes so one bugling so I
felt sick and they know I'm on an empty
stomach and they're just you made a
miserable list yeah I just wanted to
sort eat some chips now because it's
still cold as in Melbourne fellas here
no way it's 35 and 95% humidity yeah
yeah at least the convention center that
we've been filming all our videos in his
climate control like everywhere it has
climate control inside but outside it is
freaking terrible like you you walk for
five minutes outside and you're covered
in sweat like 35 degrees in Australia is
not that bad like
can you can walk to the store or
whatever and you won't get that sweaty
but here it's just immediate sweat yeah
it's just if you've never been to an a
Southeast Asian or Asian country that
has weather like this it's really
next-gen next-level stuff Wow
I'm back did you flush the toilet or did
you just yeah okay what do you think I
am why didn't hear it well the doors
pretty thick I don't know I mean you
might think people could hear is I'm not
gonna flush and we all get in there with
the nasty surprise anyway now that I've
relieved my tiny bladder I was a saying
that Tim that I didn't eat breakfast
this morning separately half of this is
on an empty speaking mistake yeah yeah
well I'm taking the advice of that
comment and it's saying have a bit of
water now sounds like Darwin yep very
very similar to Darwin weather probably
even a bit worse it's a bit warmer than
Darwin would usually be you're still
gonna be in there you're gonna finish
that oh that was the that's the gag
juice it wasn't a taste it's just cuz it
just happened to be when I was now that
works better
yeah Luke did you wash your hands
Lucas did you wash ends yes I washed my
hair washed his hands yeah come on guys
[Laughter]
yeah Graham says water takes up valuable
making if I start drinking water off the
other toilet about four more times when
we finish come on keV any predictions
for III that haven't been leaked already
so III is happening pretty much straight
after this as the big gaming show yeah
I'm out of the loop on that one um yeah
I'm out trying to keep up a little bit
with the gaming stuff but it's really
hard to tell if one of the stuffs
already been sort of even announced like
for that 76 the new Assassin's Creed
game yeah I don't know about that all
before we left battlefield and Call of
Duty or you had their own announcements
before then so yeah who knows they'll
probably show off like a lot of the
PlayStation and stuff I've had to
pre-order about three copies of
battlefield so have yeah yeah well the
only benchmark five configurations at
once so yeah
probably get a few on some PA as well
hopefully I'll need it to do any kind of
reasonable benchmarking I need about six
copies so what do we got here fiber
drink fiber drink yeah I don't know what
that is I'm not sure we've waited long
enough you want to settle you're never
bit of a bit more of a sit Tim yeah okay
did you guys get to see Brian yeah we
asked this early on the stream and yeah
we we like I said we've seen a lot of
the tech tubers here yeah either we've
seen them and haven't spoken to them no
we saw Brian and spoke to him briefly at
the Corsair party for a bit but he is
just running around like crazy so yeah
yeah haven't no scene from his video
releases and yeah just yeah most most of
the tech tubers that you've seen videos
from at Computex we've run into or they
spotted on the show for like the show
floor is big but you can people all go
to the same areas well I think we didn't
run into you what are you ran onto ran
into cave once - no we ran into Kevin
MSI boo
Tim and I have been pretty efficient
we've sort of got our timeslot gone
there just filmed and got everything out
as quickly as possible got back and
edited because just doing one video like
going there filming all the b-roll doing
what you've got to do get the
information come back editor it's like
more than half a day yeah
Jamie says will you guys benchmark these
drinks to see which one is the best for
gaming and proactivity workloads I'm
taking notes as we're going so I think
the guava juice is the best for gaming
you can smash a ton of that yeah I liked
the orange tea one orange team activity
maybe yeah yeah keep your focused in the
game yep a bit of caffeine I'm imagining
in there make sure the data is integer
to the right cell yep something weirds
happening inside the fiber one has
really no smell to it so I think you'll
be okay Tim people are commenting that
it's horrible it's horrible the thing is
though is it looks like you know when
you strain a can of like chickpeas yeah
it comes out or it looks like oil from
something like it has a very slight
sweet smell the feeling when you've been
drinking then you so now you have one
drink too much and I like the bottom
your throat yeah yep that feeling I have
that right at the bottom of my saw for
years that's what I have right now it's
like you know Jays two senses doing this
exact same stream except he's putting
the liquids into a
calling system loop you know that's
happening yeah you know for sure what
are you adding on did you bring a laptop
or desktop over each of us are using
different things so I'm using so I'm
actually streaming on it now I've got
the gigabyte arrow 15 X that's the core
i7 8750 h6 core and gtx 1070 Mac scoots
been awesome and we both Steve and I
also brought external displays so we
brought that in a display yeah and
that's been really good so what are
using Steve msi ge62 3g it's the six
core 12 3 we're both Intel six core
mobile shells yeah intel hardware so
apologies and it's definitely the best
for mobile stuff at the moment yeah yeah
yeah we both got the six core CPUs the
8th gen ones just 16 gig of ram so
that's a bit brutal on the editing and
encoding yeah we'd prefer 32 gig but 32
would be perfect yeah but so far it's
been fine like the render times and
stuff they're obviously slower than our
systems at home but it's still pretty
good yeah come on it's been good I
chucked in an a sous 144 Hertz 27 inch
panel so that's a lot better than the
laptop display yeah
what are using him the same as Steve
yeah yeah that's fine that's good yeah
it's last man right yeah I got a few
hiccups with mine because I cloned my
AMD workstation system to it and at
Jared's Jared's got it he's got the
right one
okay he's mentioned in the chat so I'll
asks do you guys have any plans to get
the Acer Helios with the r7 2700 desktop
CPU and the radio 56 yeah we have quite
a good relationship with Asus so they
basically just announce it at the show
so that's one of those things that we'll
be getting in touch them it seems very
interesting because desktop Verizon 7 in
that thing like that be cool be cool
yeah obviously vague at 56 is you know
it might not be cool but it's it's cool
Samsonite Dave art says maybe get some
backlight in to check which drink is
most fluorescent and can be used in a
cooling loop I've been a backlight
I think the thing is though you don't
want to bring a backlight to a hotel nah
let's forget that one move on
but it's a nice hotel but yes okay
that's Danish money isn't it
I don't get that wrong so please
Samsonite
somebody's already asked anyway yeah so
please let us know what currency that is
that Stephen where's teddy
who's teddy oh the guy that does all the
work at tech showdown yeah yeah now they
couldn't afford to bring teddy he's
actually back doing all the editing keV
does the filming uploads that to Teddy
and he takes care of it all so yeah yeah
just like what you do with them
yeah well yeah I don't hide the fact it
is Danish Stadium okay good guess yeah I
thought I thought it was Danish yeah
kroner think yeah that's right thanks
for doing the currency conversions for
us I was just interested in what
currents it is but yeah it's great too
great to see all those range of people
who are not only watching the stream but
yeah we've got all sorts of different
currencies here hmm
Georgia Tech ciao can you tell what
mister by a decent car he could probably
afford something really good when he
drives it absolute I'm not gonna say why
I was just about to say on this train
uh it's embarrassing I wouldn't drive
that no does he just do it though for
the stuff they film and like they want
to let on I think he like no you
literally drives it the pink one the
pink box usually just doesn't catch
that's fine I mean that's fine yes
I'd always be worried about it breaking
down on going somewhere important but
yeah I think Linus is gonna take any
kind of buying advice from us so that's
fine
yeah but yeah we haven't spoken too much
to Linus now maybe speech well I ran
into him last year he had no idea like
yeah Kyle from bit way introduced me to
Linus but like the same here at a
different event okay yeah yes no I
didn't brief Lee seems like cool he was
fun yeah yeah he's definitely wears
socks and sandals in real life that oh
sure yeah it's not for the TV he legit
wears them all the time yeah yeah that's
that's fun that's his thing
don't know about the car but we
definitely know that the socks and
sandals we can confirm that yeah so
you're ready to drink this I'm getting
thirsty all right Brian is crazy yes we
can also confirm we can confirm that for
sure Brian's crazy
yep certified and yes man yep yep still
tastes smells like nothing not taste
don't taste like anything okay that's
good yes okay what was that one fiber
dream that was fiber drink everyone was
saying it tastes our wall that one's
that pretty pretty mild
yeah sure one day it's got a picture of
a wine glass in and a line it's kinda
like apple juice almost you know it's
not as like I don't know sweet I suppose
Computex decide what part do you like
about Taiwan the most that's a great
question I think like for me whenever I
see Taipei 101 I'm a love like
skyscraper architecture right this might
sound really random but I love seeing
tall buildings and every time I see
Taipei 101 it's super impressive Tim was
on the base like ah it's it's a crazy
but it it's you know a lot of cities
have all their skyscrapers together in
one big clump yeah and the tallest one
sort of Peaks out a little bit from the
other ones Taipei 101 is in just there's
nothing near it no it's just like boom
right up
it's soot and it's at least 250 meters
taller than anything in Australia so
it's yeah it's really impressive all
right you guys
what do you like about Taiwan Computex
the new hardware it's nice it's good to
get out of the benchmark lab and jump on
a plane and come over here I don't love
the the mugginess the heat the heat so
occasionally surrender yeah I mean I
don't mind the temperature it's just how
the humidity how muggy it is that's very
uncomfortable it's somewhat sometimes
when we go to like the holes we got off
the train which is all nice and
air-conditioned we're only outside for
you're right yeah really is this a
laxative by the way this is actually a
laxative you can bail if you're on the
toilet is just there no I don't feel
like I need a throw up you can throw up
as well if you know like it's not it's I
have the feeling I'm not going to I mean
I'm a Kiwi Oh drunk enough to know
enough I just looked over at you and you
look like you're struggling big time
yeah so anyway if you outside for like
20 seconds its yeah instant sweating
yeah it's bad it's brutal I don't it
takes you a bit to recover once you get
back in
yes lots of interesting places say it'd
be great to go around and see other
parts of Taiwan at some point like oh I
was just interested I googled what
Taiwanese beaches look like and actually
look really good they do nice like not
Australian beaches let's be honest but
they definitely up yeah they're like
nice well yeah some of them could pass
as Australian beaches really yeah and
there's and the and Taipei borders right
onto a massive forest yeah thing so so
yeah hopefully that isn't elective
because that's gonna import your ass off
while they said five miles later there's
no little Exodus and we felt like three
of them so far I feel good this megamix
at the ends gonna be awesome
keep watching Carrie's gonna sue god
I've got the worst one by far to go yeah
asparagus so if you're waiting around
guys you have to wait and see us drink
the green asparagus juice I'm gonna try
and enjoy that because Tim's already
tried tried it and it's the worst thing
I've ever time it was the best reaction
and he had a couple of goes at it and it
was just awesome I had I had to make
sure it was that bad cuz I couldn't
believe it the first time i I've never
had something this bad okay I thought
how could anyone possibly enjoy that I
was like who's buying that and going
that's nice I'm gonna drink that's what
I want to try and enjoy it I want to try
and enjoy that one say we'll see here we
go yeah I think it's the main difference
you guys is that I'm guessing you guys
had pretty big breakfast look bacon eggs
there's I didn't have a lot of really
team had hardly anything I last night
when we got back from dinner I felt a
little uneasy but then I woke up feeling
fine so I think we already talked about
dinner last night but I got squid and
that was fine I was a bit it was a risky
option they're really honest but anyway
it's strange as well because I mean I
went to Japan I was in the I was in
Japan for three weeks I ate everything
all the random stuff as well and my
stomach was fine so I'm usually pretty
but I don't know something in these
drinks and the fact that I was in a
empty stomach is just like mixed
together and some atomic mixture of my
stomach I think the good thing about
this live stream is that people watching
this back later are gonna have an
absolute blast no water but this is this
is a great one he's done it seven
seventy-six you guys should heat up the
megamix for Intel level X $2.99 flavor
also love you guys work so thanks to
that we don't have any way to heat it up
and we would never even dream of it
it'd just be imagine the peanut milk ah
do you have a microwave we do know we
have a kettle we've got a kettle yeah we
don't I don't think we even have that we
just have a pod machine oh okay that's
just discussed Evan Ryan just the peanut
one so we do have a sky like X CPU okay
say are you advocating video okay even
the peanut one by itself heated up would
probably make you throw up blah yeah it
was really bad
I mean that asparagus one as well hot
would probably be oh yeah oh don't even
think about it it's so bad by itself
we'll check the iron out and see if the
TDP ratings up to the task
probably a 400 watt TDP no online yeah
maybe at least a thousand yes uh so this
is the quinoa drink it's got some bits
in it get now all mixed up nicely get
the bits go on Kevin's gonna love them
few seeds and things they're ready mate
are these because ice cold although it's
gonna be just waiting around for the
inevitable spontaneous fecal Jackson
Pollock if there's no content on tech
showdown for the next week you know what
happened yeah if we can't get our last
Computex videos out I'm actually gonna
start giving keV just a little bit I'm
getting please give me a little bit - um
yeah I'll see how it go yeah and then so
am I the only one who's gonna show is
that all you want yeah yeah I think I
think it's the volume for me that's
getting to me yeah it's not passing
through me quickly enough I'll do it
properly
anyone know where hardware unboxed is
from you could probably tell from
accents that were Australian this guy's
in New Zealand er not an official
employee of hardware box but for the
stream we'll count him in yeah we're
including him and so we live in the
southern part of Australia we live in
the state of Victoria which is where
Melbourne is so I live in Melbourne
which is the second largest city in
Australia
Steve lives near there but out in the
bush Victoria so yeah all this
documoto if you're not from Australia
all this stuff you might seem like the
Harbour Bridge an opera house or in
Sydney which is our bigger city which is
up not north from us
but we're right on the sort of bottom
edge and it's good weather yeah it's
fine well okay yeah yes fine it's very
cold there right now and not nearly as
humid as it is here significantly low
mate the weather and even when it's 45
I'd rather be outside in a 45 degree day
in Australia than here why are you
trying not to murder him I thought Aziz
in Kiwis hated each other even even I'm
not enjoying watching kev suffer through
this yeah this is my house I've been a
rugby that you keep mentioning yeah I'll
make sure I projectile on this direction
that's how much I gave keV and that's
how much I gave myself so yeah you guys
gonna have a fan meetup from Leanne
Jones if you're coming to pax Australia
in Melbourne we'll be there yeah it's so
shows like Computex and CES in that part
for the public you can't get in as a
public member but packs you can yeah so
if you're in Melbourne and you at pax
Australia we'll be floating around there
we'll be there every day and well they
will let you guys know when we're there
if you wanted to sort of run into us
they'll probably be that we'll probably
do that different to this show I would
say won't be there for most pretty much
be there all day and then we'll do a
video at night or something so you might
get in some horror box content that'd be
exciting yeah so if you're at PAX
Melbourne come say hi
we'll be there thinking you buy tickets
now already so it's a good show apart
from meeting us that's another highlight
there's a lot of other cool stuff you
can see there there's actually good
stuff there's actually good stuff that's
right I'm freezing in Coburg well you
were in Coburg not that long ago I used
to live in Coburg it's great place to
live so you probably might have seen me
on the streets at some point there
anymore but it's good good area to see
of Melbourne do suburb called is 20
degrees for them yeah it is anything
below 20 is getting pretty chilly yeah
below 20 we start to put on our jeans
and hoodies and that sort of thing it's
probably sounds outrageous if you think
in the UK I like mid to high 20s it's
just so funny like the first time I went
to the UK the only time I've ever been
there it was 30 degrees and people were
losing
Mines and I was just rocking a t-shirt
and shorts and having a blast it was
great weather it was beautiful day
beautiful sunny day and people like oh
my god I'm dying like I'm sweating my
ass off here they're all beetroot read
it please stuff James says so this is my
opportunity to buy them buy them drinks
and give them to you guys at PAX yeah as
long as it's not peanut butter milk you
can buy us drinks
don't don't bring this stuff but yeah
we'll be all right oh so he did say buy
these drinks I read that wrong sorry the
screens quite far away so James said so
this is my opportunity buy these drinks
to give to them yeah okay yeah sorry
about that
I butchered that one yeah hello to
everyone who's watching us from around
Australia from Townsville Brisbane
Sydney lots of places
alright come on you guys are stalling
big time you never given you a tiny
amount all right it smells quite fine
this one so Kev's just go on write your
names just getting this over and done
with
oh that's like that's like the porridge
one from earlier but like a little
different mmm a slightly different
flavor it's still nothing it's not it's
not bad no it's not bad it's just it's
like thick water yeah you're right
you've gone bit quiet hey Steve how many
pcs do you run during benchmark around
well it depends what I'm doing like but
to usually I have one on my left when am
i right and then my main system in the
middle and that's pretty much the most
optimal way of testing you can't really
do more than that and because we don't
well if it's gaming benchmarks even then
twos difficult because a lot of it's
like custom benchmark runs that you
can't automate yeah yeah so we'll have
to do a patreon behind-the-scenes video
for your office yeah yeah yeah you can
call some water mate you can have a
pause if you want yeah all right no it's
just to clean my hands all right in the
chips we all would have forced you to
spew if you like yeah you don't have to
keep drinking we've done we've done how
many now eleven so that's pretty good
going I'm definitely not letting you do
the mix so cabs out he's out he's
looking way too green for that so oh
I'll see now you're
now been here since three days subs from
wow wow favorite take you to the 3k
that's going way back that's the matte
days yes well I started with math thanks
for the $10 yeah so three case I mean
back then I think if you go back to look
at some of the content it doesn't don't
watch it there are codes I don't even
watch the content when I started for
like the first months
it's interesting you see where we've
come from and I'm sure care view have
the same thing you go back to look at
your first ever content and you're like
yeah my most my second most popular
video which has over 300,000 views is
one of my first videos ever did and this
is me sitting on a webcam no b-roll just
holding up different gaming mice yeah I
like this one or like this is what I
think of this one
and 300,000 people watched it so I don't
know I must be doing something right but
yeah I leave it up there and I see a lot
of channel say like they take down their
older stuff cuz if their channels a
different now but I think it's good to
leave it up I'll let you know we came
from and it hurts your YouTube stats as
well if you do it yeah unless you're big
enough to take the hit and then yeah few
people saying Jared out of you yeah guys
check out Jared stick he's a really yes
guys so fantastic channel we should
definitely out check him out
yeah and he's doing more laptop content
than Tim now so yeah really good laptop
stuff seems having a pivot yeah he does
some good stuff so definitely go go
check out his channel and of course text
showdown in fact I put a link in the
description be cool textures channel so
yep he's got some very funny Computex
coverage he did a vlog on it was the
first thing he did was at the original
Monday was a second video I did that was
the first video filmed and we found it
was with our Windell from low one techs
and then I've done the that awesome
builds one where I got the booth kill
and the thumbnail oh that was pretty I
was gonna go to the toilet but then I
was doing for me just regular action you
sure you'll get through that way okay is
it all that milk isn't milk getting you
know no I mean the other type of thing
he's fine
your son he's fine he's just it's a lot
of liquid that's all I'm feeling better
now after I think it was just an empty
stuff
because I don't feel sick anymore I
think it's because I had nothing to eat
and then I just had all this mix inside
me on an empty stomach
and now that I've had some shit I was
okay I'm glad you're recovering I was
getting a little concerned for you there
I'll make sure I still bought that in
your dream well it's kind of the worst
time I do this as well because I don't
know about you guys but at least for me
my stomach
I haven't felt sick or like a minute or
I'm going to be sick it's just eating a
different kind of food your stomach just
doesn't have the bacteria to break it
down like it normally wouldn't you sort
of walk around feeling a bit I don't
know unusual not yourself all day so
it's as bad after last night because we
yes of us didn't eat all of yesterday
then we went to this dodgy restaurant
Steve picked and then we ate quite a bit
of food and it was like the food was
pretty bad there was heaps of mosquitoes
when they first set us down and we were
worried we're gonna get sick from that
and then and they not kept my partner
Kester and she ordered a tea and it had
a cockroach in it so there was like
roach tea yes so that was a good sign
and then we had our actual food itself
wasn't particularly good but me and Tim
had the same thing and is that we got
you a gift keV I actually feel fine now
well we don't trust you like what you a
gift I have a bag this patented hardware
box official chum bucket for the live
stream here you go you might need it
before I do I think especially if you do
the make a Mexican actually I'm not
gonna say anything cuz that thing might
wipe me out I haven't tried it but yeah
Tim's reaction was hilarious I could I
couldn't believe it was a real thing
like you seen it's like there's no way
that's good and I was right Steve if he
ever beats msy in north melbourne the
one with it oh yeah the one where they
use an internal USB header cables the
door handle and they've never replaced
it oh well I guess you never been there
no no say in a CD okay there's a PC
hardware store called ms white one of
the big ones in in Australia and their
door handle but it's obviously fallen
off and they literally just use like a
USB cable wrapped around it and so funny
well it must be a pretty strong cable oh
yeah it gets loose ages and maybe that's
a stress test that there
conducting that's disgusting Jared we're
not gonna use the bucket to brew the
Vitamix poor rootless dude that is so
ruthless is it wrong that I want to now
make that that it is a guy I'd almost
vomit just watching you drink out of a
bed that means come the garbage bin from
our toilet yes on the toilet don't put
it too close to your face no I'm looking
at people if you do things if you did
that I'd be stunned no we wouldn't do
that no we might use some of them to
clean it okay all right I'll um so are
you not ready for any kind of more milk
things you want to leave him to last the
juice one and love the juice milk but I
only give me a little bit because the
milk is really gonna screw me Tim did
you talk some om Zin to sending you some
rice and laptops I haven't a lot of the
laptop areum's don't come to Computex
like dell and HP and the big ones a soos
was here a little bit there's all the
Nova why's the bus but you know we'll
grab all those all those rising laptops
I really want to test the rise in 720
700 you and yeah do some other stuff
with that stuff so that looks weird
yeah I gave email I gave you the least
amino yeah we definitely be doing some
more rising laptop testing and Dell is
sending out their vague known yeah
the KB like everything G I'm game wide
as I get back into Australia so we'll be
doing some of that and comparing to
Verizon mobile doing everything so
usually the rest of the drinks as PC
cool I think the viscosity of some of
these liquids may be the problem is
they'd go off well that well I mean you
wouldn't be doing it for more than a
test but I think some of them would clog
up your radiator instantly like a very
very thick and them
you've only got very fine channels like
like something like this that'd work or
like none of the milk ones would be most
most than that one it is start to smell
really bad if you use milk as a coolant
really bad yeah yeah yep I I think that
would probably I'm almost certain that
would cause like hard line pipes
for the compression fittings to blow
open yeah it would milks very similar to
water in terms of its yeah but as it
like goes off oh yeah and it expands
because that's right the gas you would
definitely blow that the hard line pipes
open for sure
well not the pipes but the fittings
would would blow out and you would have
off milk going everywhere just wondering
how long have the milk drinks been out
for we took them out of the fridge right
before the streams and it's a very cool
air-conditioned room we're outside we'd
be sweating we are yeah we're going to
do this in the park and then seems like
you realize it's hot outside I'm like oh
that's right let's not do that yeah that
would be bad someone said they're asking
about a giveaway there what me oh sorry
gone yeah let's just say we're gonna be
doing a giveaway with ITEX showdown and
hardware unbox after I get back we'll be
organizing that and that'll be a full PC
full gaming PC giveaway see you guys
when I definitely if you're not
subscribed to tick showdown a hardware
box is only gonna be for subscribers
only and that'll be that'll be an
international giveaway so um doesn't
matter where you are in the world we
have to ship it out to you and it'll be
it'll be a good gaming PC like it's
gonna be a pretty powerful good game
that'll be free and be free so that's a
good combo yeah I love doing the
giveaways so this is it's kind of like I
guess a fruit smoothie kind of because
you've got it's got a lot of fruit on
there well that feed Joey I wish I'm
assuming these things are in there you
know orange strawberry feed Joe a what's
that peach look like Apple sorry well so
that's like kiwi fruit it smells like
Metamucil I haven't had Metamucil yeah
it smells like orange Metamucil okay but
it's it's got all that fruit in it
apparently well that's what we doesn't
probably be very we don't know if it
claims to have all that Ferguson isn't
it yes Neil asks Tim will you try take a
look at the console focused a sous cg 32
if they say it looks really interesting
and I've been looking at the things
you've been posting our discord for the
patreon I think it looks really
interesting it's a I believe it's a 4k
60hz our 600 panel okay that does free
sink and it's designed for consoles but
you could also use it for PC
if they say if there's someone out I'll
look at it but like with all my other
stuff we rely on the the companies to
send out the higher end stuff so yeah
it's up to it's up to a sous on that one
well we're gonna upgrade testing
equipment for monsters when we get back
yes we're gonna finally do response time
test you've been asking about that for
every monitor you've ever done you will
get response time will do input lag and
we're upgrading to test HDI as well and
we've been in talks with all the
companies about how to do hg are testing
properly so check out all this stuff in
the future but also is very interesting
so it's it's sort of a yellowy milk it's
like it's not take a taste for it now
very bit honoré hmm a run saying it's a
cleanser so that's gonna go down well it
tastes like a lolli version of the
fruits that are in it like it's not
legit fruit yeah I find it that sweet
hmm you're right come on all right this
is a lot of milk for Tim so I'm not I'm
sort of lactose intolerant I can't I
can't cop milk or your art no I can cut
yogurt and like cheese fine but milk and
ice cream I've been taking mercy on him
and giving him just a little bit of the
milk ones so this is gonna really f me
up no IDs gonna be rough Tim the best
way to do HDR testing would be to use an
Xbox one Windows is too consistent yeah
if we were testing it subjectively but
we we're gonna get HDR testing tools to
input you know like a pattern generator
straight into the monitor that gives
HTML a data and everything to test it
the same way that we've been testing
srgb but it's a lot more difficult like
this it's hearing some of the stuff it's
just like no one knows how to do it
properly hmm so they're all they're all
testing it yeah baby of trial and error
on that one
you guys gonna destroy the aircraft
toilet on the way home luckily we're
flying out tomorrow evening we were
flying today if we're flying home
tonight I would not be keen on doing
this really we never would have done
this if we were flying out no I'm just
hoping that if there are any
repercussions
we're recovered by tomorrow so we leave
it flight takes off at what 11
11:25 p.m. p.m. so we got plenty of time
with you don't leave for a while I don't
when I was reading Jarrett's going
assume you can't take the megamix on the
an international flight I can just
imagine the air hostess asking about it
and almost vomiting when you rinse your
head a sniff there would be but you know
this is yeah you'd want to keep that
chilled that's for sure this looks
that's French on that says it says I'm
banana on this one
I'm banana and it just looks like water
yeah yeah and she J's two cents if
you're watching your stream which I'm
sure you're not
definitely do milk liquid cooling
I'll watch that he has he's done yeah
I'm certain he has I'm sure I saw him
you did that quite a while ago
yeah Jared you milk okay they did the
yellow in mint it's all good
well wise possibly mixing yet some other
stuff in there I should make a good
tutorial on how to calibrate your
monitors and create profiles yep we'll
probably put that on patreon first and
then maybe publish something to make
sure I'm not sure whether it be because
you have to buy hardware to do it I'm
not sure it'll be too much mainstream
interest but certainly I'm planning on
doing a guide for that it's pretty it's
pretty easy once you're familiar with
the software so this looks like sort of
like soda water it's completely clear it
just looks a bit foggy in there because
we're mixing it with everything else
we've bought this smells exactly like
banana lollies like you know those white
sort of exactly exactly so it's a liquid
banana lollies yeah overall how's the
trip being to Taiwan uh I heard that
your last trip was pretty busy but this
time it's been last year yes a surreal
it was super hectic and it was more
optimized this year we're much closer to
where we have to be so travel times
super fast for us we seem to have the
knack with getting on the trains like I
think only once we had to wait one
minute for a train pretty much every
single time the train doors were open
Tim I'll walk down the platform straight
in straight there but yeah we've got
everything done pretty easily this year
so it's been a bit more relaxing we've
been out
enjoy it a bit costume wasn't with me
last year so that's the main reason why
yeah it's been good
have you ever sleep yet yeah what just
respond chest open Emily's Geordie take
some chances I've done a recent cleaver
laptop review and it costs three and a
half thousand pounds it's hard to build
a channel I agree YouTube does make it
very difficult to go out at the moment
it's gotten so bad we always love seeing
small creators but we understand the
pain that you guys are in to sort of
grow but seriously reach out to
companies because even if you think that
you're too small to get samples or
anything companies are more than happy
like you might not get it as early as
other like the big guys would get it but
yeah you can still build your channel
around reviewing expensive hardware you
just have to get out there and talk to
the people and don't even necessarily
invest a lot of time doing a dedicated
in-depth review do something different
with the laptop that no one else has
done yeah that's a that's how you get
picked up on like searched and
recommended yeah yeah whether it's like
tuning it or just something like an
overclocking guide or how to improve
thermals you might not be I don't the
review sample but come up with just
simple ideas you can do to make some
sort of unique content or even things
like how to upgrade the BIOS because
that's something that's going to do well
on search for years to come yeah
overclocking like a big thing in laptops
that I personally don't cover is like
thermal paste or e-application seeing
how you can go with the you know
improving the coolers in those laptops
so there's certainly a lot of things you
can do as a small tech youtuber and so
they just find what you like doing it
but definitely don't think that you
won't get samples from companies because
reach out and they'll be more than happy
to work with you most of them yep I
would say going to in order to build on
Tim's point going to retailers can be a
good move the local retailer and just do
a deal like just go in and say hey guys
I'm well I'll give you some
advertisement can you just let me have
certain products on loan for like you
know two weeks or something while I do
my when I do my review and most of them
will jump at something like that because
it essentially doesn't really cost them
anything especially if they're gonna
make it a demo model like a laptop out
on their show floor anyway so you can do
deals like that and that can be quite
good but
like you it's an oversaturated platform
now you have to be doing something
different or just look quick I would say
the best advice if you're small which
still applies to me because my channels
is coming up on 40,000 subscribers is
look for gaps so search through maybe if
we just wing about laptop reviews look
through them look up different laptops
that maybe this retailer you're working
with has and look for ones that maybe
there's only like five reviews of it
instead of like 50 and review that one
because when this 50 your videos are
just gonna get pushed down especially if
all the big channels have covered it
you're gonna have a hard time and that's
what I would say is it good if you find
a gap then people are more likely to to
find your video if there's only a
handful of them out there otherwise
you're just gonna get it no one's gonna
see it and it's this and disome
happening yeah and if you're just doing
it for fun like have fun making it
that's definitely it don't don't do it
for free hardware or definitely don't do
it to make money yeah so definitely just
you know make sure you keep having fun
making your videos and and yeah if you
wanted to grow sort of look into those
sort of niche stuff but the best thing
is for a small challenge you have to be
passionate about it you have to be you
know really engaged in making your
videos and it comes across in the videos
too if you are having fun making the
videos your videos will be better
absolutely so yeah that's our advice for
that sort of stuff we've got a super
chat here from Christchurch New Zealand
Steve thank you for your top-five
Z 370 motherboard video got myself in as
rock said 370 extra nice very happy with
it top-notch work yeah
Oh glad you like that one yeah that that
very good those boards very good value
for money as ROC has been for a long
time I still so yeah give you a small
year like he got New Zealand locked down
I play to expunge me when I had 300
subscribers you don't have to be big
think about it from them think about
you're the tech retailer okay so I'm
getting advertisement and it doesn't
cost me anything I just have to give
them the product something that they're
most likely if it's with components or
something else they can just sell as X
demo for a little bit less like with
Intel CPUs and so on we'll just
by it anyway there's plenty of things
you can do in that area it's you just
don't have to be big I think it's a bad
mentality that some small youtubers have
was like well I'm not worth absolutely
anything like no one will even take a
chance on me just try think about from
their perspective if it doesn't cost
them anything and you're giving them
advertisement then even if you're only
getting a hundred views per video that's
still a hundred views they're getting
for essentially not costing them
anything
exactly so they're you know that's a
deal for them so ya can get picked up
when you're really small by these
companies without and with the
manufacturers like what I was saying
earlier even if they're sending you
review samples directly and you get
don't Lee a few hundred views that's
fine because again the only thing it
really costs them was I guess the
shipping and that's nothing to a big
company like them and you know just send
it back afterwards and they rotate these
things around anyway from reviewer to
reviewer yeah they're more than
especially towards the end of the cycle
you know yeah that a lot of companies
just have this stuff sitting around yeah
like they're not used for anything
they're just in an office somewhere so
definitely look out for that here's a
question that saw just before here do
you guys have day jobs so you might have
the opinion that we have day jobs but a
day jobs are for at least brass hardware
box yeah because we make so many videos
like we don't have time for literally
anything else yes you know I have 100%
full time on the channel and gave you a
full time as well right yeah yeah yeah
so you can't put out it's very difficult
to do the struggles to do one video
working a full time job doing something
else one video a week would be so hard
yeah see what Jared said don't worry
about the numbers it is stuff like that
first like going from zero to a hundred
subscribers is tough and then a hundred
to a thousand is tough but just think of
it as like a a giant snowball and as you
get bigger and bigger the growth keeps
it's expanding if you're doing you know
if you keep improving if YouTube doesn't
if YouTube does it but it does get
easier once I noticed once the channel
got over 10,000 subscribers then
suddenly it just seemed to be a little
bit easier like your head was above the
water then and it does get a bit ease
but that first hundred don't be dissin
hardened at the start like you just
yeah like Jared said it took him nine
months yeah it is tough you just have to
keep keep going with it and it
collaborations helped a lot as well and
a lot of us are really open to it even
if you're a small oh my oh my god
whatever's in that it's not meant to be
a drink
so no ii says I wanted I wanted to do
airflow testing since I don't see it
addressed in a lot of Chinese yep that's
a good area like if you had a channel to
get into I think game is Nexus is gonna
go hard on that but you know it's always
good to get more people doing that sort
of testing you know even if you see a
channel that you think is couldn't
possibly do anything more to test
something there's always different
angles you can take there's always
different what's also good to confirm
those results exactly we don't want one
source doing anything so we're gonna
step up to this next string whatever
that is is horrendous yeah that smells
no it's smells horrendous it might be
okay there's no way that's good what is
it it's it's adlai which I've never
heard a lie for I haven't around rice
milk I'm gonna have to google that ad
play as anyone in the chat know what
that is it has like wheat or something
on it what is it because that's not
brown rice either it looks like it's
some kind of oats or something oh it's
so leaf oh it's called jobs tears jobs
tears one maybe Tim's tears in a moment
well it's pungent it's a tropical plant
like durian its oldest Chinese pearl
barley in Asian supermarkets ah that
makes sense all right here we go smell
like any bowling outfit it's used in
cereals and it's basically like a grain
it actually doesn't taste as bad as the
texture and the smell ones it's oh is it
like I likes it have one again
sugar it's got peanut butter Oh another
peanut butter why it's got flour it does
smell like peanut butter actually the
aftertaste is horrendous oh I can't wait
it it's not as bad as I was expecting
it's just another one of those ones that
taste like cereal it's been uh it's a
bit weird for me so I found the other
one I thought yes weird it smells worse
than it tastes so it definitely does but
it's kind of ya know it take ah
it has it the aftertaste is horrible you
know this cereal wait I reckon it is not
necessarily the cereal wait is it taste
like that the aftertaste look at me is a
killer
the initial taste isn't it smells bad it
tastes it smells bad then it you soon as
you touch you know you get get it in
your mouth it's like that's gooey sweet
aftertaste so we've got we got one more
left one more drink left and it is the
worst by fight is the green asparagus
juice drink it's the my stomach just
feels so so your eyes are watering
big-time can guy should have got a jury
in and opened it don't I'd throw up if I
had it
add ruin immediately it's just it's next
level how's your stomach
it's yes one's okay oh it was a bit
better after I've went to the toilet
just cause like there's a lot of stuff
in me I found the toilet helped yeah
well probably have to go again as well
that was something else look yeah that's
gonna be great in the the mix that one
that I I if that was like the nutrition
of a breakfast I drink that for
breakfast
hmm I think you'd probably get used to
it maybe possibly I think it's okay it's
not that bad I mean I can't read this
but I know I didn't like it at all I
don't feel like I need to go the toilet
I just feel so what are we drinking so
if you if you come late to the stream
you're wondering what on earth is going
on here
we actually got 15 drinks like local
drinks from Taiwan that we'd never heard
of before they're all a bit weird some
of them turned out to be just regular
drinks some are good some were sober
then we have
like the peanut rice milk was really
awful we've had this is like a quinoa
drink so if we're trying out all those
the stream so far and just seeing what
local people like to drink good I mean
to be fair you can get like Coke and
stuff you perfectly easily yeah but all
that other stuff is a bit worse megamix
we'll have all the nutrition you need we
thought we've got we've been talking up
this Megan we've got a bunch of
donations for the megamix so it has to
have oh I'm definitely asparagus food
I'm just waiting for yeah we could do
the asparagus
all right well curbs finishing that are
we there for a second okay once you
break the seal it's all over I know oh
it's been a fun stream going nearly two
hours now it's been good it's been two
hours yeah we started at 10:00 it's
11:48 local time yeah now so yeah it's
been good it's a good stream very fast
oh yeah when you're drinking these fun
drinks just funds well yeah last ones
gonna be the last ones horrendous like
now that I've drunk the other 14 drinks
it doesn't compete with that
it does not compete that is the worst I
got this sick feeling my throat again it
just keeps coming like in waves and
there it goes away so Megami excellent
that will get to the megamix as very
very shortly very shortly after the
asparagus juice we promise we promise
we'll do it should I trust even between
them throwing up and throwing up on him
yeah okay I've see his reaction all
right okay we're gonna troll Steve and
make it seem like I'm throwing up we're
saying whoa how loud it was in the
toilet Steve's explosion man I'm feeling
gross secondly I feel great I'm ready to
go again made room it's getting pretty
pretty door you can bail if you want you
look like this I brought the bucket for
you didn't you look don't do the bucket
thing here on the stream I don't know if
endl of yours you look green as you
don't yeah awesome right okay I'm just
gonna finish a drink yes
that a hottie has shot shadows ten bucks
away should have a beer after the
megamix yeah we might do that we'll go
into a bar and string that oh my god
whoa okay that is definitely the worst
definitely your worst smell out of this
thing
dang it you sure you want to get into
that oh my god that's so bad I was just
reminded of the taste I had left and
we're mixing it with like what's left in
their mouth Ralph if I drink that but I
won't throw this one are you drinking
that it's legit the worst you cannot
give me much you can have it on stage oh
my god oh no but I've got that I had was
sent and I basically I knew threw up it
was so awful dude that smells so I feel
I can't I can't I can't exploit what oh
geez we're not we're not acting this up
like it's it's seriously
you see it's it smells like asparagus
gone wrong it smells off yes it smells
off all right we got to choose this one
guys cheese and all do at the same time
Tom you sexist mean all this to Computex
I don't smell it again just wait bucket
don't throw up on the string I'll lean
this way so they can't see it I put it
over here thing I don't think I really
want to hear it either I'll try and
shield them okay don't throw I'm not no
I'm good
it's actually not as bad as I thought
but it's still nasty I'm just gonna
dazzle this you guys ready oh my god Tim
I'm gonna dazzle all that oh my god is
so bad that that was that's me my eyes
all right I don't know how this is gonna
go
oh my god it's oh it's horrific it's her
get some water - frickin horrific oh
that was hard
oh that's disgusting so it would drink
that whoo I know
whoever like knows that oh boy this is
gonna be great my spare string
Oh glad that's gone I'm happy that it
doesn't really spell smell like
asparagus
it smells like like just general green
greenery in like water like I was hard
it's made by like asparagus put in water
right like that's how they do it they
just put asparagus in the wall I don't
know what they disgusting huh oh it's
horrendous it's the worst drink I've
ever tasted the peanut butter one was I
felt that my chest you there's no way
I'm not drinking anymore it's it's
horrific you're bailing leave it in
there for the megamix you can't put the
mega mix in there there's way too much
asparagus in the megamix that can be to
steve's mega much so we do it oh that
was bad all right megamix time we got to
prepare the mega mix so I hope you have
any more doughnuts and make me go for it
make it for me and I'll have a sip of
the mega mixer or not if I down the
whole thing off I'm only doing a sip you
know Megan if there's no way you guys
talk amongst yourselves well I uh
so we'll get all the drink Kat can you
tip a little bit that down the sink for
us well diary about it it's gonna get
much worse that one was so you're gonna
leave that's you're happy with that that
asparagus that you got there so are you
gonna have it for those of you who've
joined into the stream you'll soon see
all the drinks as I put them back oh you
look like something what's gonna come up
with this but I felt like something was
right the problem for me is that I had
it previously so I was getting like
triggered before it's not it's nasty
so yeah it was more the mental thing of
I've tasted this before and I know how
bad it is just feel it like yeah so next
I really want to try this with the
asparagus just together I think they're
gonna be okay do that first and then
we'll do the megamix you can have the Oh
Steve's gonna Steve's gonna hello
my stomach is employing Steve's gonna
have the two worst together to see what
they're like combined and then we'll do
the Megaman laughter please have to do a
little bit more of this I've got to
tweet out the fact that we're doing the
mega mix because oh man that's that
looks
they don't even mix and Tim look oh my
god oh my god it's like that oh that is
like sentiment Oh
if you drink they will battle you drink
that whole thing all that they're
separating like that we've got some mud
in the bottom in good swirl I'm trying
down it I don't really know if I want to
do that oh wait let me have a smell
hang on I'm still mixing no I'm all
right all right oh my oh my despair oh
my god okay these are bad I cannot get
over how bad that smells
that is insane that looks kind of like
sewage that is guys that is so bad oh I
got one of the worst things I've ever
smelt in my life and I'm not even
exaggerating that is horrendous
alright where's the bucket cuz I don't
know how this is gonna go just put it
down there after you say you want me to
guzzle that yeah yeah just
you've probably best to just do it in
one go what do we do on this channel
again channel available to take channel
yeah I really never thought we would do
this kind of thing I feel I feel sick
just watching this people have donated
actually decent amounts of money for us
to do this so thank you all to those PLA
thank you go down and make a me you
can't you can't tell how bad is but just
trust us like there is smells
oh we're not making it up like we're not
mean isn't for the camera like by those
two things put them together and you
know one would yeah anyway I'm just
gonna do it do it
oh it just comes like stripe it tries to
come straight back up oh man I feel
ready oh don't you look like you're
getting sick now I'm alright you're
better yeah I think going my stomach was
like not straight away
oh I sure don't want some water before
you make a mix not good I want to do 15
drinks in one glass yeah so just do
little bits of each if it oh that is oh
yeah someone in our patreon has changed
their name to Tim's asparagus - ever did
that you are a legend you are our
legends I think it was Ed said our Hardy
classic the only way this the megamax
could be worse is if we made it hot but
even cold it's gonna be her own just
these two look at that are we will have
to get some b-roll of that and put it in
the discord because putting the
asparagus and then putting that in there
I've never seen yeah that is gone man
that's him another smell look at that oh
my god
it's worse when you mix it but look at
it it's I've not seen that before that's
bizarre
I don't know what that's gonna be like
not in finish not good not good I didn't
already tell you freaking me Kev's
freaking me out more than the drinks I'm
alright alright I just have dry wrenches
that's all emerald oz hey don't know if
it's because I was looking those looking
at those Atkins together and you look
away I can use Tim's asparagus juice a
good job boy the asparagus juice is the
worst that year by far yeah so patrons
monthly and you get access to things
like Al Mike we do some monthly live
streams on patreon we have
behind-the-scenes videos and we have a
discord chat
so that's a good way to support the
channel and help us out we're always in
the discord Judd I can tell you now we
aren't doing this again this is an
exclusive first time only okay no no
this is an annual thing at Computex
we're doing this again next to the mega
mix again next you see are you are you
going now no yeah okay I need to go as
well so all right we got the green we
got the bubble green tea in there so
that's it that's in there actually
you're right they're filling up pretty
quick so I'll just do a little bit of
each we've got the what is this again
the watermelon milk or the watermelon
milk let's hold this up so you guys the
glasses or every comment says mix the
megamix in the kettle those glasses are
too small we wouldn't trust the kettle I
don't think here there's a bit of a true
Picard says for the megamix this is
great it's like a hardware box video but
we thought worse tasting stuff and how
to maximize impress smell all these
milks are gonna kill Tim man this smell
is next-level well this stuff's this
stuff's good so I only do a pinch of
that because that's that's quite tasty
that so I just put a little bit of that
the ones that tasted good I'm not gonna
put too much in like I have a cat and I
always thought that cat urine was the
worst thing I could ever smell no it's
not it's really not so this vitamin C
stuff was good if you've just joined
this amazing stream that is just vitamin
C no it's called
or something so someone asks what would
you guys recommend for a gaming anything
left up in the $1,500 range I'm assuming
you mean US dollars our portability
doesn't matter I think we might be
seeing a few more budget laptops come
out with the ice 78758 very soon a lot
of them currently have their 7700 HQ in
them we did see here at the show and an
MSI one yeah was the MSI GF 63 or 65 I
think now looks very GF 63 yeah it'll
have up to like a 1050 TI or 1060 it's
got a 750 action that's a good option
that we're coming up later and we also
are quite like the ace of predator here
the
300 hopefully that will get upgraded to
the 8750 H and then it'll be a really
good option as well and those those two
are about a thousand dollars so you
don't need to spend fifteen hundred
thousand dollars all you need is there
any way we can get a secondary camera or
put a photo on the stream like can you
put something on Twitter because that is
having some sort of weird chemical
reaction and it looks horrendous on top
of it now get it get a top get a video
that just goes well whatever it doesn't
really matter that looks absolutely
disgusting it looks so bad so I'm
filming your video now and then there's
the art to mix it there's like dang I
mix it yet we got to get it all in there
first so that's what it looks like at
the moment so what we've got a few more
in this stuff was good so I only put a
tiny bit of that yeah this is such like
an atomic mixture in my stomach right
now yeah it's gonna get a lot worse okay
I'm gonna cuz I don't know if the
hardware box to count on my phone I'm
gonna put that on my personal one and
retweet it so you'll be able to see it
in just a moment oh wow that's the the
juice milk
yeah that's shocking oh that looks
really bad that looks like the worst
thing yeah it's the easily the worst
looking thing you could put in there so
that's uploading now the body talk we
will retweet that so if you're following
us on Hardware box that video will be up
very shortly in our Twitter you get a
good look at the megamix progress and
yeah shout out to my girlfriend who's
apparently watching the stream back in
his trailer and having an absolutely
ripping time she is loving it she may
see you throw up actually probably seen
it before but yeah we're not dripping
that in quite as well as we could be
well it looks like you sewage Brown is
the color we're going for here so this
is the video is up now on our hard one
box Twitter account at Hardware box you
never see the progress chart of the
megamix and I'm just gonna
yeah it's this chemical X some sort of
chemical reaction going on here I'm just
gonna mix these up and get them all
ready for consumption hey young keV you
I'm not having in waves
yeah I'm not confident you're gonna make
it into this at all not not through it
to it I don't think you'll make I'll
make it to it I'll do it I'll be right I
don't know what will happen after but I
just need it to like sit or like it
comes in waves so I need to get it on
like that down wave where I'm not
feeling I'm genuinely concerned for keV
right now after we've worried about him
and he's looking pretty rough Tim will
be fine he'll pull through
that asparagus almost pushed him over
yeah that was nasty I'm still for every
now and then I get like that it wants to
come back up yeah I'm fighting it I'm
keeping it down I'm feeling good at the
moment you call that the balloon me a
drink for me okay
so I mean that doesn't look too bad it
just just to finish it off it just it
just a dash of G G for hates and temps
we're adding a dash of asparagus juice
on the top so what I haven't actually
done yet is how give it a whiff it's not
as bad as the first two but it's not not
remotely good you okay yes oh my
oh it's chunky yeah it's it's it's um
there's a few odd chemical reactions
going on here and they're sort of
bubbles up there on there and injure it
out this super chat Oh No Norwegian
Viking kroner from someone thanks very
much for that appreciated okay we've got
a bunch of outrage minutes on the O's I
can actually look at the food what does
it look like it looks disgusting yes
it's actually gotten better than either
I've mixed it
while they're all pretty much the same
so who's going first I think we should
do one by one right all we should do is
come what the person city let's do
rock-paper-scissors to see what are we
going and then we can and then we would
decide I'll go first if you want
although yes are you drinking the whole
actually you two go first because I'll
chole I'll attempt drink the whole thing
okay so Steve you're committed to drink
the whole thing
Oh what the hell I mean people paid us
money to do this yeah y'all have a go
decide who goes first okay Rock takes
birth so is one two three don't throw up
because I don't know if I can do it if
you do that you will ruin the stream the
smell of you throwing up I know I can
tell when I'm so just as a reminder get
it on normally a tech channel normally
yeah that's right we do we do we do I
take legal tech video I think so yeah
I can't remember what this channel is
all about I just have like that that
like when you've drunk just like one
beer too many type feeling and it starts
feeling sick but you're not gonna throw
up but you just feel if you asks for
inches to the bath remodel and all about
it someone's already in our discord chad
has made he's cut out the glass in my
hand and we're gonna turn that into an
ammo for a channel to megamix them oh
that's the new cheese yeah all right
kids come on come on yeah
all right let's at least take me the
first victim you don't have to sip it
yeah
did you mix them all yeah I mixed it but
they sort of start to separate it's
actually not that bad okay I'm stunned
but I wouldn't want to drink the whole
like if you drink the whole thing not
just good not the taste but like what
will happen to you now feeling better
about that then okay guys no disco chat
they're watching I'll put up that amount
in just a moment
dream team heavy orbit all right I'm
gonna mix mining yeah I'm not gonna
scale mine but I'll I'll smile if you
scold it that would come straight back
up it just the viscosity is disgusting
but loading stuff in it yeah it looks
like freaking colonies of something in
there this is not meant for human
consumption this could turn into
anything by this time tomorrow oh man
we're gonna have to post updates on this
yeah it's not actually as bad as you
were thinking the asparagus by itself
was way worse than that trust me oh it
just smells terrible give it a good sip
though oh it's like it's sweet but it's
got a hint of all the bad stuff yeah
it's not too bad though and we have a
sip to sell them in for oh man I can't
really look at it oh that would melt
them oh my god that didn't go down well
yeah that is bad it's not but it's not
as bad as the asparagus by itself that
was the worst this very Scott but if you
drink the whole thing it's not the taste
of it I'm having a lot of regret right
now a lot of regret how you feeling I
say oh that's a real bit yeah I'm
feeling a bit unfair sick my stomach
that's all my stomach's throbbing a bit
all right let's just do this someone's
also cut out my expression oh you guys
today is a legendary day yeah all right
Steve Steve's working right into the
whole thing
oh my god oh my god eat
Oh that nearly came back up those so
close yeah you look like you would cast
me out to chuck I just save that
that's nasty oh oh I need to do my
Redemption
I mean I'll so close then yeah that's
all right oh no yeah I don't think I can
do that without throwing out I'm sure if
we get a few more divisions hit you have
to but no it is really terrific yeah
well I got that far I think that's a
I'll like you drink way more than I did
I've got this much left yeah I'll give
it another minute and see if my stomach
settles down that's was I can't live how
close that was coming back out before
try to a whole mouthful like I just did
Tim like just not know I did for the
mouth for the first time oh yeah it
might not seem like I did by when I went
in when it goes down you can like feel
it coming out straightaway I've never
experienced that before with drinking
anything cuz I've never done always that
hell has it been since you last for
vomited oh yeah probably
finally vomit if I get like yeah gastro
or something which has only happened
like once or twice in my life that is um
that's something else that's bizarre
I know it's like it doesn't smell bad
and it it tastes like you say it's not
as bad asparagus if you said it it's
just as soon as it goes in you like no
it's
if you sip it it's okay what you can get
away with it a guzzling er like that was
yeah it's so thick and unusual you can
feel it just well people are donating
mate Graham's got given us $2 and Drew's
giving us 500 it is 2 pounds sale
ASIMO's it's not clearing this is giving
us five bucks for Steve proving his
manhood Oh like I cannot
be sick immediately if I drink it I
didn't think it would make me gag like
that almost rot I was pretty shocked by
that yeah I can I think I can do one
more drink and then I'm done
like I could probably get about half of
it yeah it way worse the intel's thing
the other day we're worse than five
gigahertz we have to make videos on man
can I get a few get a few mixed drinks
in Tim many starts spilling everything
so yeah we'll have to do this again next
year in Computex or something like this
I know you win careful you have to find
another youtuber then move your leg I'm
gonna go ahead oh no I'm just gonna have
another crack and that I was shocked to
my head that with the food he's given
another crack guys here we go dude I
feel so sick just watching you like
drink that much of it hang on hang I was
acting I really do it on I'm gonna get
some nice close-up footage no I think we
need another angle I don't try do the
whole thing
I feel so sorry for you I did the whole
thing I feel so sorry for you Steve I
can't act my eyes oh yeah I'm alright
and here's the look guys for you
watching this video this is the megamix
oh my face goes so hot
the official hardware box megamix
closing your eyes for some reason helps
I think if you can see your glass I'm
just gonna sit from it not so much okay
oh man I can't believe you drank the
whole thing there's a moment leaving
like horrendously I can feel it like my
I can feel my stomach like gurgling well
this stream ended up sucking way more
than I thought it would it oh no you
know it's done it more asparagus no
we're good just imagining the asparagus
drink makes me want to throw up
well it's so bad the smell is something
else it's like not meant to be in the
human body it may not be for that long
Kevin Tim finish it oh oh I'm head about
a quarter and I think I can get it down
to half but then I'm not really keen on
either of you to be pushing it out I
like her there's no way I'm not there's
no way I'm doing I'm not keen on saying
that happened yeah that's um that's
weird that's it's funny because all the
stuff together is Orion our stomachs
yeah that's what I was joking about it -
keV giving him a heart you're up yeah
you sure if you look green and come do
it just it comes in waves like it's like
you're like nice and then it comes I can
still feel my stomach it feels like like
it was a megamix footage is now on our
Twitter that close up you'll be able to
see the footage of the drink and the
glass this is our best Computex calories
man here in roar a big THANK YOU to MSI
and Corsair who are our two major
sponsors came join me give a shout-out
to your major context monster throw up
SIA
yeah MSI fractal and Rockette thank you
guys for seeing me out here about MSI
link in the video
description for our stuff so check that
out the drinks are technically on MSI
the drinks are on MSI for sure oh boy oh
dude it looks so sorry as I'm recap for
people who have just joined us what's in
the mix we have asparagus juice we have
T we have juice milk we have come by we
have a quinoa drink water melon milk
banana drink bubble green tea peanut
rice milk guava juice adlai and brown
rice milk we've got this orange thing oh
here we've also got the porridge in a
bottle and the body talk my father Dean
drinks
my body's talking and I'm happy
apparently asparagus juice is good for
curing nausea you're not fooling no
could you imagine having a jump on a
flight soon oh man could not done it
Congrats on doing stupid drunk stuff are
being stone-cold sober thank you thanks
we're very proud oh my god why did we do
that
what like wow I don't even know why we
had this idea I came up with it the
other day I was just like should we go
down to the local store and just get a
whole bunch of Rome stuff I think that's
right when's the 7-eleven a few times
and this is crazy stuff damn you like
wonder what some of this stuff's like
I'm just go for a pee break one second
and I had the asparagus juice earlier
because I wanted to see what it was like
and I could not believe how bad it was I
was shocked and I thought there's got to
be more of this this is YouTube gold
right there yeah it's pretty damn bad ah
so megamix is over we still got some so
yeah this goes to the drop in click
thanks Jamie we might we might need it
do you do the same thing but with weird
alcohol now you got to give us guys
ideas for next year we'll definitely be
at Computex next year so give us some
ideas of what you want to see you know
like we're gonna have to make this a
traditional live stream maybe not with
these same drinks though but yeah if
it's weird alcohol we can
give that a try or something like that
put on your Steve from Michael well if
we find different drinks I mean we
didn't we were thinking we'd also go to
the places that make you drinks and
getting some of those but we just we
just stuck with the stuff you can get
from wherever we went
yeah 7-eleven what's worse the drink or
the aftermath yeah my stomach is super
unsettled I feel I'm great I'm so glad
it's done I'm so glad it's done you
cleanse yourself
people are still posting in that discord
images of like the drinks and stuff did
you come man we we've already got the
wd-40 memes you've got the mega mix now
absolutely like full diet drink now yeah
I'll be okay okay I'm getting better I'm
recovering about a quarter of these were
like laxative track type drinks like
cleansers and stuff so I don't need
lunch it's 12 o'clock I'm good we do
know I don't think I'll eat for the rest
of the day I'm not even J I'm a little
bit hungry for food but I think if I had
braids of myself yeah if I ate is for me
not gonna end well Steve ready to finish
off the other two there's no way they
[Laughter]
did I need a big donation to do that
don't even encourage I don't want to put
a number on it
they don't even yeah that's all good we
don't need to say that happen we've yeah
mission accomplished mission
accomplished this wasn't even the
intention no we were our main intention
was to chat about Computex and have and
try the drinks as we did it just as sort
of a thing 40mm oh sure that's a good
idea what so that's healthy Graham yeah
come on Graham be serious this isn't a
silly-string
now alcohol if you just if we added
alcohol to alcohol would probably help
do you think nob make it worry would
make you more nauseous no yeah no mm-hmm
so if you have any more questions about
computation yeah it's like $100 I'd
probably do it for $100 but no I
shouldn't commit to that no don't don't
do it
yeah
yeah not both of them $100 per quarter
thanks Jordy for your two bucks next
year's alcohol I'll be there
I'm sure you'll you guys will tune in
for next year's thing will do something
equally is well we'll just we'll do the
exact same thing we'll try and find
different drinks well we'll have to
bring ah sorry we'll have to bring
asparagus where is it where is it where
is it the asparagus juice is a channel
staple yeah be good we might have to
take that empty bottle home with us yeah
we're gonna have to take a nice picture
of that to give you guys an idea of what
so that'll that'll be here again next
year and probably the peanut the milk
look is it just peanut it's peanut rice
milk can't rice on that moving around to
get those drinks is making me feel
really ill yeah we're not lean for a day
it's like yeah those two equally nasty
really so they'll be back and then we'll
try and find 20 other odd drinks so well
there's a lot of stuff that we didn't
get no this tapes so many I can't get
over how many different drinks there are
Oh stay why did you do it oh hey party
howdy you late oh no ste have my one cuz
it's a bit smaller I'm so annoyed that's
why I said you shouldn't have put a
dollar value on it we're doing I think
we can refund it but I mean you commit a
Zeb's in our hadi did give a 64 gig of
ddr4 says it ah hi he's one of our best
pet remember so thank you very much for
saying yeah yeah cheese thanks
so guys just know so the hundred was for
one so everyone so you don't know all
through one god I hate this channel are
you saying we might close hi Rob yeah I
think it's I think we're gonna have to
close it down
we had a good Ron Rafi dude I mean it's
a good donation so like my worst buddies
caves been drinking this I'll spin the
glass around hopefully I'm in a safe
zone right
you gotta like yourself for this one
don't ya I'm stressed out massively
we've got the bucket don't we yeah bring
the bucket around at least you're not
drinking temps cuz that's like another
how much I can fit my dummy this looks
pretty bad I have to stare that first
that looks really bad I'm telling you
guys now there is no amount of money
that would make me drink it
I'll have another set so you wouldn't
know I drink the whole thing
ten thousand oh I'm feeling more and
more ill as this dream continues to go
on I was starting to recover a bit I
have to admit and that could all change
pretty quickly we're probably getting
mass unsub's on it how do you feel even
watching the stream there's about 300
people watching okay that's good hmm
alright how much for the next drink I
just don't think I mean if if we get a
decent donation how about we all have
one sort of good like mouthful sip of
Tim's one would that be alright we've
actually had our best couple of subs
that's good I'm not gonna do it in one
go because that's way too much and it's
so thick it's so do it in two goes I
don't even know how I did the last one
and honestly I don't know how I did it
mmm I really regret putting that extra
asparagus in there just think about our
Computex coverage and how well it's been
going they said two thousand foot 10 mm
I mean five hundred for the two thousand
that would pretty much pay for your
airfare yeah I don't if you don't have
two thousand or a funder that's just
ridiculous
yeah it's too much money I do hmm
a century egg for five foots a century
egg Oh at the 7-eleven Brian ate like
four of those live students that they
were delicious okay he's weird though if
we go to Japan life to get some that
rotten sushi yeah stuff is like a
delicacy this is by far the best
Computex coverage from hahaha I'm just
psyching myself up guys what do you buy
em si
and Corsair and all our other sponsors
ah fractal yep hmm here we go oh that's
a good house breaking from you is so
nasty that fit that facepalm grab a
screenshot of that we need that much
discord that is so nice and just for you
guys I'll take a bit more oh oh hang on
a sec your stomach just rejects it
straight away like it's something it's
like it's not a gag reflex trim like
your throat it's like it hits your
stomach yeah and your stomach's is
trying to like oh I've never felt
anything like it before and of what
we've done this sort of stuff as kids
but not this sort of stuff that this is
weed I've never drank anything like it
it's making my like you know we like
you're saying you're wacky your throats
like activate when you want for me it's
when if that parts okay as soon as it
hits my stomach it's just like my whole
body just so sound discord yes that is
how I feel all right I'm gonna try to
finish this off cuz it's just painful
thinking about it I'll so relieved the
last time and then I've done it again
that that second drew I want me to help
you get through yours I doubled the
amount I drank and it is it is a
nightmare I did more who's Tim Coca now
on all right give me a breather
don't died I've got to drink so much
more Donna I gotta pee
you're killing me I'm right know when it
when it first went in I know I'm trying
to think about it it it came too
straight back out I'm trying I just got
my eyes I was I was so focused on
getting it down it went like this in
yeah cuz I know if I vomit on stream
I'll never live it down
no let's just oh dude there's a lot on
the line here ah the aftertaste
grab some water seriously cuz that
starts horrendous yeah my stomach's
throbbing alright let's let's just
finish this off your water is behind you
I think I put
anything I want to fill my stomach up
anymore the liquid let's just get this
done let's just do it we're gonna do it
hot chili challenge now that's an idea
because Stephen I freaking hate spice
yeah what and all this whole that's it
that's the idea what we'll do is we'll
find the spiciest stuff we can and just
get through it
we'll have get fire noodles and stuff
and then we can see well I'm terrible
like I just I dunno Nando's in Australia
like mild is like too much for me that's
how weak I am on that stuff so alright
it's gonna happen
let's do it let's do it let's do it it's
I can smell it from here as well it's
just so bad like it's so bad all the
sediment on the bottom of us oh god I
can't believe I got that down Jim can
you not describe it as I'm drinking I
hope you at man I could have finished
that if you didn't start discussing the
sediment in the bottom yeah it's pretty
nasty
you do realize how sick you are gonna be
later right says Jeff yes
oh man you we're in for it now we've
gotta edit stuff we're gonna film
another video after this I feel so sorry
for you well that's uncomfortable
alright now for that we're done dude the
feeling in the back of my throat is so
strong they're like sick feeling
we've got travel insurance for hospitals
don't we yeah yeah
we're gonna need it oh man oh this is
not what I had in mind for this dream no
we were thinking you know we've got a
nice casual chat about and just super
couple kiss really drinks we legitimate
Tim please label the video the official
Intel fuck gigahertz demo drinking party
yeah we had we had no plans to make a
mega mix before we came on the stream we
were just going to drink them
individually yeah
they stream this stream got our hand
Steve is gone Steve is a champ I agree
with that
like I couldn't if I did the whole thing
this guy not think about and have
someone describing the sediment in the
bottom of it it's it's literally like
that stuff you can get them makes you
vomit straightaway yeah I can feel it
yeah like I've never ever ever eaten or
drank something I can does that to you I
just got a whiff of like asparagus juice
I don't know it yeah I could I could
smell the glass the whole time buddy I'm
okay seriously you two are freaking me
out
no thank you where's the do you want to
take that away cuz Timms yes the
asparagus choose now like put it over on
my desk over there we'll keep it in the
shot I just I'll just with some of this
banana and it'll be alright so there's
nothing yep steep Steve's the champ for
sure guys like if if yeah I know you
guys want I know you'd want us to I I
just can't if I have one more that's I'm
like I know my limit and I'm like that
feeling of I'm about to throw up yeah I
got lucky for sure yeah you go I think
Jen said they're like yeah that first
first go I had you guys to get a throb
if you hear us throwing up on stream and
you're not feeling well yourself like
Jarrod is that'll be it well I am I can
tell the guys to say this is just a
beast but even then like I eat how does
you in the discord man discord is going
off asparagus juice make it makes the
official drink so back to tech related
condo subscribe to Kev's channel please
do that links in the description below
tech showdown give him some love his on
the stream has been a great sport
joining us for our ridiculous concept is
the sweet fun it's it's just that it's
been lots of fun
like as bad as it's been yeah it's I'm
just surprised like we'll keep you
up-to-date in the discord chat with how
we're traveling
yeah I'm just stunned that you managed
to do I don't really want to get up and
walk around now what's the feeling like
inside for you it feels unusual yeah
it's it's bubbling and I can feel my I
can feel the innards of my stomach it's
unusual yeah it's kind of yeah it's it's
weird it's almost worth doing to
experience it you could get you could
get there just by getting me these two
they yeah if you guys just those two are
just unbelievable together those are the
big guns in the mega me yeah they do the
demo mix those two together guys and
have them he'll be making night yeah
we'll bring them back next year for sure
don't knock anything over I'll write a
few more comments I'm just gonna move
slowly forwards what do we got here I
haven't actually seen the refreshed
evolve X case but I did love the
original is the refreshed one just a bit
more practical I'm not sure laughter
look I really like givens content though
he's kind of an ass for leaving his
co-host at home yeah Eddie has to he has
to hold down the fort there yeah
watch the my latest monitor video you'll
see I included some footage of Teddy in
there it's the chats going too fast now
I can't read it yeah well it'll
definitely be a tradition for this trade
show anyway I don't know if I want to do
it more than once a year
so much liquid yeah there was we had a
lot yeah we had a lot I feel like yeah
moving at Jared said where's Jared the
second but seriously 4k beer on that
last one yeah we'll get you would if
you're feeling sick if you watch that
well you saw it in 4k it'd probably make
you throw we've got the problem is now
it's it's nice it's not separate what
we'll do is what we'll do is we've still
got I think enough of everything so we
will redo another one because it's when
you like we've got to film the process
casting because when you put certain
ones in it starts frothing and like
bubbling and the peanut the peanut milk
in the asparagus is like in crow
but I'll get 4k footage of that we'll do
that after the stream well we'll upload
that I will awaken the patron discord or
whatever but that that's probably the
hardest part watching it being made and
knowing you've got a drink that has the
strongest flavor yeah but when you
believe that introduces the words when
you put that into the asparagus the way
it looks is just it's like there's no
way you would entertain drinking that
and massive share deserves that are
hardy whoo yeah what a legend donated
that money big big shout-out I'm happy
about you on yeah so yeah he's been
supporting us for a long time so thanks
mate very appreciative of that
Steve what was worst asparagus juice or
peanut milk it's a tough one they were
both absolutely terrible in their own
right Baraga smells way to smell I think
I smelt that obvious yeah man I I think
the peanut butter wasn't as disgusting
this it was just really strong like
really strong but combining them was
just unbelievable I could not believe
the smell and I wouldn't mind yes it's
the worst thing I know I was a dream I
could have never imagined that it would
smell like that combining them so is
this the new direction for the chat it's
a lot easier than benchmarking it's a
bit more painful at times yeah yeah any
cases that we saw a Computex we didn't
don't use any red max cases no we
checked out the new deep cool cases that
$40 one we had all one looks awesome
yeah we've got a video coming up on that
quite a few people have covered it
already but we thought we would anyway
we did a few other things there they've
got some nice new coolers but it's $40
US isn't it $39 it's not it doesn't have
as many of the fans is showing the
footage no it's just got one fan that's
not an RGB or LED fan of any description
but it's got like a like an RGB sort of
light bar thing on the front which looks
kind of cool especially if you like your
RGB tempered glass for 40 bucks it's
tempered glass and it can fit extended
ATX motherboards in there it's a pretty
standard layout inside but yeah looks
good so for $40 there's a lot of
competition already in those cheap cases
but I think that's a a good one favorite
new upcoming product I think we covered
that a bit earlier the stream screen
forever
if you call things on show there's all
you have a lot of things that I'm
looking forward to checking the outside
monitors I'm looking forward yes ting
out because some of them I said a video
on them some of them are quite
impressive
the Enix g25 one which is their 240
Hertz 1080p 0.5 m/s response time g-sync
monitor that's gonna be quite cool but
we they didn't tell us do they tell you
the pricing on did you think one yeah
they do don't know what the pricing is
but if that comes in the right price I
think a lot of you 1080p gamers that
play a lot of competitive games would
really like it it's quite a cool monitor
with any things that made you guys go
wow that I I want that on my personal
setup I said the angled thing from from
cool mask was quite cool and with a GB
memory as well that was cool I would
want to make a gaming system with that I
reckon yeah an ad centric a gaming
system nice water cooling I love I know
I love the MSI I know MSI sponsored us
but I genuinely loved the extra in
creation that just ya know that was a
lot of people said oh they don't like
the look of it which is fair enough to
be subjective halls higher I just got
here did I miss much nah didn't miss
anything
no anything we weren't this drink
there's nothing to do straight that's
just a coffee blend don't rewind and
watch it or anything yeah so I thought
that motherboard was cool I definitely
that's the motherboard I think I'm
unless there's something else crazy that
comes out but I'm 99% sure that will be
my new editing rig Tim wants one as well
so we've hit up AMD for a pair of 32
core CPUs and NSI for a pair of
motherboard yeah install Cadence's get
them to drop the stupid Meg from the
name I believe that is no idle name no I
already told them they definitely can't
release it with that it's terrible and
yeah yeah so I'm pretty sure it's just
gonna be the accessory now nine creation
yeah I told quite a few people that they
have to change that so they took that
under advisement so hopefully they do
because yeah it is I didn't know what
that's all about
and what are your thoughts in the 8086 K
did you do another person yeah it's for
25 I think it's on Amazon now yeah oh
okay I don't know what how much like
anniversary edition things are cool but
like it's more of a collector's edition
I suppose if you like really a
passionate
well it doesn't really matter because
just now you know how much more does in
the ID 700k like but by comparison but
um yeah it the creation motherboard has
no well has Gigabit Ethernet it has two
ports I think it's 10 Gigabit Ethernet
that I think it to appear it's got Julia
yeah I think you saw about 10 yeah it's
for 25 us for the 8086 ok so I think the
a 700 like 350 or thereabouts these days
it's just say it's like a collective
agency pay you be interesting to see the
one thing I want to test with it is how
far it'll overclock like is it like an
extremely bends like can you get five
point three five point maybe push
blackboard I'd say most of your five
point like you've still got a deal it'd
them anyway so you're getting an
anniversary trip to then hack it yeah
put it back together and then it'll just
be like on its a negative or okay yeah
so if you're doing any it's just for the
novelty factor like that's the only
value in it yeah having the 8086 pay it
is a limited edition ship so they're not
making tons of them it's intelligent
Intel's 95 90 isn't essentially because
of both of them with five gigahertz and
they both rule release just for the fact
of what would CPU the FX 9500 yeah I
think city Intel no I said its Intel's
oh yeah ok the 95 90 yeah yep
gave to bear only got 7.3 on a line to
it didn't beat it won't be I think they
might know I just thought it was super
like a super super super been one but
apparently yeah if that I didn't know
that so the super bend ones are the one
is the one I got which does do bow
thinks that there I've got there are
basically golden sampling yeah okay at
which is still a bit of variance in
those anyway it doesn't guarantee 5.3
yeah the Trident Zoo Royal Ram yeah that
looks cool you see if yeah that's we've
got to do we've got to come up with some
sort of special case mod for that one
Tim's asparagus juice asked me in the
discord is your phone a pixel to excel
yes I use a pixel to excel that's what
you were just seen there this thing
takes very good pictures doesn't about
this video is that you were seen on
Twitter yeah of us drinking the megamix
welljust Steve freakin they Megan I get
I get a couple of backfires every now
and then yes terrible Amon yeah yeah bit
of pressure build up I think it yeah
there's a bit of a chemical reaction
going on in there
yeah the 8086 actually is a lower base
clock than the ad 700k doesn't it it's
about four gigahertz base and 8,700 case
four point three I think that's right
I'm not sure all in that yeah I didn't
pay any attention to it because I just
knew it was a it's a generic a so I know
I'm thinking of the old court over know
just figured that point seven MC with
MCA enabled on the 87 okay yeah no I'm
just mean default out of the box now 700
K they're usually sits about 4.3 yeah so
yeah I'd imagine the 8086 also sort of
probably at 4.30 you benchmark the Omega
mixers we could probably bench mark the
megamix drink as thermal paste tomorrow
it'll be thermal paste tomorrow igloo by
tomorrow yep
so you tune back in for tomorrow's plus
the n7g case 3.7 base
yeah 4.30 and 8086 case for base 4.40
case of 100 maybe yeah so if you enable
MCE though that's yeah yeah but it's
gonna run stinking hot because it's
still ah it's not a solid it'll be a
nuclear like it I haven't followed much
of the coverage on it because it's just
a nothing chip for Tim and I but if I
have sold it yeah it was assaulted
Schiphol that would have made it
yeah I feel kind of cool I think guys
were arguing saying but you get better
results by deleting and using liquid
metal but I don't know whatever I'm
using oh hey we've got a few spam spam
is in there do we yeah here we go
Tim's Tim zapping them so don't worry
about that I've been in spam yeah ban
him from the channel get rid of that and
yeah yeah how long they've been going
for go for nearly we're going for 2
hours and 40 minutes here well how many
people are still watching set roughly
300 it's dropped out of it after the
megamix no surprise there yeah
on the third one no way it's be good I
mean probably don't have all that much
want to say really it's just about
answering a few more questions yeah I'm
just trying to stay upright yeah that's
right
no I still had fun I mean this was my
first Gumby Tex it is very stressful as
a creator um it's you we you two yet to
get around like there's a lot last night
I was just trying to get all the footage
I could at the big white boots of
everything I wanted to cover there
mainly their coolers and power supplies
and you're just absolutely rushing
around trying to get everything and it's
a it's it's stressful and a different in
a different way and everyone's trying to
upload videos and that and it's you know
you but you also got a lot of
commitments because it's good here to
meet up with obviously out there take
YouTube is you want starred to fit
everything in yeah people from the
industry you want to go to parties
because that's good for like networking
and all that and you just you just flat
out so you basically you get up at like
6:00 a.m. and you go all day till about
11:00 at night and you you're just flat
out the whole time yeah it's it's quite
stressful Kyle asks how many Computex
videos you get to come out for us we've
got three three three and then we're
hopefully going to do so we've got some
other few other things to do got a few
opinion piece things we want to do with
some some information in that so we're
hoping to get them done if we're not
sick this afternoon so and we want to do
a silly little video where we unbox the
things we got at Computex unbagging I'm
bagging bagging so Tim did one of them
at the end of one of his videos so we've
already do a little bit of it when do
you think 4k 120 Hertz screens will be
hitting the market this month they're
already out the g-sync ones yeah there
is this one hey someone's already out
now
that's 27 8's ones coming to the end of
the month yeah so they're both the birth
this month what's the best part of
Computex overall it's just seeing cool
stuff I mean yes meeting people like
it's always really fun to go and meet
the craters that you sort of follow on
you yeah sort of we also know in the
industry and that sort of thing that's
always a good time yeah yeah the whole
thing's it's meeting people they're
going to the parties are neither good
because you can kind of relax a bit more
and meet with people and stuff and
that's quite
is it hard to access vendors with so
many people in the shadow floor um
depends we yeah it depends that on the
booth like MSI booth was like 50%
employees it's like that their entire
global workforce space that was
ridiculous there was just way too way
too many people and they would what and
they were so none of the people that
kept walking in front of the cameras
probably saying for you we're all MSI
people that would just you be filming a
product and they just walk like they're
like oh it was the same last year as
well yes some of the booths tend to be a
bit quiet it just depends what's on show
like obviously if there's a lot of new
stuff those booths are packed the ones
where it's just less exciting and less
packed but I've been to like Mobile
World Congress and it's much busier at
Mobile World Congress it's and and the
halls are much bigger so it's just
different I think it depends is that one
open to the public as well no it's not
oh okay but it's like four phones in
that sort of thing and wireless
technologies so you get all that sort of
stuff any collaboration ideas
oh yeah ideas with tech yes city and
tech deals probably we often do stuff
with Brian I spoke to mr. tech deals
just before we left for Computex and he
also wants to do something with us after
Computex so we'll tee that up with him
so that shouldn't be too far away so
that's always good stuff I saw a comment
about AMD's through dripper to pricing
on the 32 core it's gonna be expensive
obviously but yeah I don't know maybe I
don't know what the u.s. pricing was but
in New Zealand the 1950 X was about 1550
which is about similar and I'll see it
would have been a thousand us yes about
thousand u.s. so I would imagine the 32
core will be above that well well well
yes so it'll be over 1,500 us well we
were I mean wait what'd I say it will be
we have no idea at all
Tim and I were discussing it but yeah I
don't know I really don't know we're
settled on that one I kept guessing
around yeah it's hard to say we don't
know we're not under embargo it's like
we do know no I tell you but yeah well
I'll see you going here we go to e3
not going to III just want to get home
to other stuff
the most surprising this wasn't a
question but the most surprising both
for me here was the acer one nothing in
it they had about three product that a
massive booth yeah it wasn't like a
small boats but they had a huge area
about the same size as like msi and all
the other becoming he said and they had
literally three products in sat three
was it is real one of each of the items
like some companies have like your msi
their new mourners they have like three
or four from there yeah and then i said
one or and there weren't even new
products and the booth was every time I
walked past was just empty
yeah is empty cuz I know huge wave
Cygnus a mass of course of customer
fortune yeah maybe they thought they'd
have something to show off and then they
didn't at the last minute but all right
a second I've got another liquid run
yeah we definitely ever did it do you
think Nvidia will unveil eleven series
of hot chips we've been hearing a few
things that Computex about when and
video will be really seen their new GPUs
hot chips we've seen that conferences on
August 20 now that would make sense
I think they'll definitely have
information by then we're sort of
hearing at the moment right at the end
of July yeah from multiple sources year
so something we've talked about the
channel before but July August do so
yeah I'd say so yeah so obviously you
might have seen you know Nvidia CEO
Jenson came out in the press event and
he wanted to talk about all of his drive
compute all of his AI stuff yeah
and then he made that comment that we're
not going to see in video g new consumer
gps for a long time but basically what
we've been hearing from everyone else is
that that's a big load of crap and that
they're actually coming into next month
so end of July is when we'd be expecting
it from what we're hearing at the moment
but we've been hearing that for a while
anyway we'd be on July for a while and
that hot chips the in August is
definitely still on so yeah you won't
have to wait too long for that
32 core thread Ripper for $9.99
now it would be too cheap there's no
what I'm gonna do it no way they don't
have the incentive to undercut by that
much I mean anything's possible like I
said we have no idea so they could but I
would oh yeah
that would if they did that you'd be
this the Warriors for a company
obviously they have to recoup costs and
they don't need to undercut Intel that
much to you know the question sorry the
question is how done is Intel or if they
managed they whiff they did that and
they it was still profitable then that
would be Intel yeah a very bad space I
don't think it would be that bad for
Intel because H DDT is a niche platform
I think that may be a worse move for AMD
to do that yeah as great as it would be
they'd lose you know market share that
segment but they're not going to lose
anything from their server market which
is without having thought about it
thoroughly what would you put the
pricing at me yeah
1,700 u.s. 1700s yeah 7800 I would put
somewhere in there because like they'll
definitely be releasing the 24 core as
well and they'll have the 16 probably at
12 - I think you'll probably see
something like 12 core 500 you'll have a
16 core for 800 you'll have a 24 core
will be the best value from around a
thousand and then the 32 core will be
the typical you know it's the top-end
model we can push it a bit us around
1700 but again we don't know that's just
a guess what Intel's most worried about
is the epic CPUs yes like the server
market is their big moneymaker and well
that's the other thing though they've
still gotta sell the epic see for you so
you can't make a high-end desktop CP
$1000 you need to call epic CPU isn't
that expensive it's only a few thousand
like it's well below that yeah high CPU
core counts chips so well yeah Jared it
it would but you can always upgrade to
the 24 core because I mean you wouldn't
need to change your extreme no no mother
would and I would I'm sure you'd
probably still get a decent price for
your 1950 ex yeah I mean the 1950 ex now
retails for 900
so and still would be true yeah I mean
we don't know the specs we don't we
don't know how much better it's going to
be is probably going to be similar to
what we saw with first gender second
generalizing so at the same call now
it's not gonna be a huge leap if you can
take advantage of 32 cores and it's
really going to speed up your workload
then it'll be worth it but if you're
struggling to use the 16 then it's
probably not going to be worth it I mean
yeah if it's on Jerry if you like your
1950 ex if you're editing videos mostly
that is very very powerful
I'd really don't think you'd need to go
to the 24 core for editing videos it
would be it wouldn't be very good at all
but for encoding it would be great yeah
and if you do other things like
rendering and stuff like that or
anything that confused all those calls
will be fantastic
yes ed realistically 16 courses playing
for me dude 16 courses plenty for
anybody nice yeah even in some
applications like premiere you get
scaling issues of that amount of cause
though we didn't notice with the other
effects if you apply it lots of them
yeah if you if you're doing like a lot
of parallel processing but for video
rendering like at the 18 core Intel CPU
isn't that much faster than like they're
12 and 8 core ones form editing yeah
just because that scaling issue I just
love the composition between Intel and
AMD yeah it's so good so that's why we
want to see Intel keep coming with new
stuff as well because it should be
interesting if it just swings the other
way yeah any tell just keep rehashing
the same old thing
well Intel you know they might finally
figure out 10 nanometer and they might
have you know it's there 7 nanometre
tech might be raring to go you just
don't know like it's gonna be good
they could sell back big company oh they
got a lot of money so don't think for a
second that they're just sitting on
their hands because they're well they're
not anymore yeah but I think the 9000 as
we spoke about earlier I think the 9000
series from Intel will be 14 plus plus
plus
French says but the cause will be
bottlenecks by the RAM well then that's
that's totally true because I don't
think so
Ram access is still fine through
infinity fabric but it will hurt if you
need if memory bandwidth is the limiting
factor to your app yeah like as opposed
to having all the COS able to access
their own memory controller but for and
will probably impact gaming as well but
it's not gaming CPU it and no but things
like video rendering for things like you
know not necessary simulations but
certainly AutoCAD and those sort of apps
the memory bound thing is not going to
be a big issue and at the very worst
you're going to be getting with the 16
core thread room I mean we'll run a
couple of gaming benchmarks on it for
our day 1 review but it's super
pointless there's really not if if you
can afford to buy a 32 core thread
Ripper system you can afford to buy an
8400 dedicated gaming system so yeah
exactly
there's just no point gaming on it at
all
there was a question up about I think it
was 2200 G or Rison v 1400 yeah by
Dennis it depends on pricing really if
that will if you're not going to use the
integrated GPU in the 2200 year I would
probably go the 1400 could you just get
SMT support so that's probably
especially if they're very similar in
price as well which they should be yeah
2200 G's great like such a good value
yeah it's really good if you're not
going to use the integrated GPU yet and
probably not worth if you've got like a
1050 Ti or better yeah yeah guys going
after the megamix yeah just settling
it's definitely settling so yeah that
was not a good idea well we definitely
do it again yeah well they go for pretty
much nearly three hours it's probably
time to wrap up the stream yeah it's
meant to be like a one hour stream yeah
back to work to do if we do like chilly
next year that refunds
I'm extremely weak when it comes to
chilly I know I'll make myself do a my
then it'll be mine it will come back
your way yeah I can go pretty good in it
but yeah so I'll wrap it up there I
think so I think so
well anyway thanks for watching I hope
you enjoyed the stream yeah crazy
big thanks to care for
made it a lot more entertaining having
three of us and Kev gagging every five
minutes so putting me off my game
I'm glad Tim was able to hang in there
as well it was looking a bit dicey for a
while right yeah
the megamix is killer man yeah yeah and
their frickin advice ever see that
asparagus juice again we've learned not
to joke about things we could possibly
do on stream yeah don't bring them up
because I said that are harder you'll
make you do it yeah cool all right
thanks everyone for following our live
stream and we'll catch you in the next
video stay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
