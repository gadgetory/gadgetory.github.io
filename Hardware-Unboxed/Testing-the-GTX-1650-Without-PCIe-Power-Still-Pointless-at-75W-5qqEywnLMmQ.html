yesterday I checked out the new geforce
gtx 1650 for the first time and i was
very disappointed with what i found for
some time now AMD's Radeon rx 570 has
been or at least should have been the
go-to option for budget-conscious gamers
it absolutely obliterates in videos gtx
1050 TI and it's been the cheaper of the
two to buy ever since the cryptocurrency
mining boom thing cooled off so the
radio rx 570 really is a great value
gaming graphics card but as great as it
is I was really hoping that we'd be
getting a cheering bass GPU that was
even better especially having waited all
these years sadly though that didn't
happen the GTX 1650 struggles to ever
match the value of the much faster rx
580 the only possible advantage the gtx
1650 has is its power efficiency it
might not be the fastest thing going
around but it does sit power and using
less power means cooler and quieter
graphics cards or at least it can in
this case though I suspect it means
bigger profit margins for AIB partners
as they can get away with slapping a
crushed coke can on the thing and will
still run at 70 degrees still the GTX
1650s that I've seen so far do run cool
and quiet
despite their unimpressive looking
coolers the other advantage to not using
much power is well not using much power
and that means the GTX 1650 doesn't
require an external power connector at
least this one that I've purchased
doesn't unfortunately though the models
provided by MSI and gigabyte for review
did require external six pin power
connectors and this does place them in
direct competition with something like
the cheaper and faster Radeon rx 570 so
with the help of our lovely patreon
backers I have purchased the gigabyte
GTX 1650 OC this one is a hundred and
ninety five millimeters long so it's
quite a short graphics card and at way
is just 377 grams so extremely light for
a graphics card and yeah I mean you guys
can see how small it is and not a
particularly large aluminium heatsink
but most crucially the reason why I have
purchased this graphics card
because it doesn't have an external PCI
Express power connector there's no 6-pin
pci e power connector on this card as
you can see so it is limited to 75 watts
anyway for a bit of context I suppose we
do have the well that stand up for me
not really we do have the carlo used in
my day 1.5 content so that is the
gigabyte gaming OC version now this
graphics card as you can see is
significantly larger it's much bigger
they're both dual slot cards but this
one's just longer and much heavier it is
something like 36 percent longer and it
is 76% heavier so much more substantial
cooler on this thing and yeah just a
bigger beefier card but as you can see
it has a 6 pin connector so it can run
above the 75 watt spec in terms of
pricing the smaller version without the
6 pin PCI power connector costs one
hundred and fifty five dollars u.s. so
that's only five dollars over the MSRP
the gaming OC version note that I used
for my initial testing that one costs
$180 us and does require 6 pin PCI power
so it's 16% more expensive out of the
box the base model targets a boost clock
speed of 1700 and 10 megahertz while the
bigger version aims for 1800 and 15
megahertz when gaming the base model
typically boosted to 830 megahertz
while the 6 pin model hit nineteen
hundred and fifty megahertz meaning it
was clocking seven percent higher and
that's a reasonably large difference
because the base model is limited to the
75 watt power delivery of the PCI
Express x 16 slot it can't clock higher
as it would be running out of spec and
doing so could risk damage to the
motherboard therefore out of the box we
saw a pic GPU load of 67 watts whereas
the gaming OSI model hits 72 watts given
the limitations overclocking the base
model isn't really possible the cards
power limit is locked to 100% and at
most I was only able to squeeze another
15 mega Hertz out of the cause and even
that was a little iffy pushing the GPU
load to 69 watts however I quickly
discovered the gtx 1650 is extremely
memory bound so if you spend the small
power budget available on the 75 watt
model by overclocking the four gigabytes
of gddr5 memory this does Lee
to reasonably impressive gains I was
able to boost their memory frequency by
17 percent as you're about to see that
did lead to some fairly impressive
performance gains that said though the
6-pin models overclocked a much better
and again we'll look at those results in
a moment overclocked the GPU on the
gigabyte gtx 1650 gaming OC picked at 91
watts an average turn operating
frequency of two thousand and seventy
megahertz which was really quite
impressive for testing I have just a few
games and then the usual test systems
been used which includes a kora 999 reco
clocked at five years with 32 gigabytes
of ddr4 3,200 memory ok let's get into
the results first up we have World War Z
and here out of the box the performance
between the two gigabyte gtx 1650 models
is basically identical which might seem
a bit odd at first given the 16 model is
clocked 6 to 7 percent higher however as
I mentioned earlier the gtx 1650 is very
memory bound so much so that you have to
really under cloak the core quite
heavily before you see a noticeable
decline in performance leaving the core
frequency untouched but boosting the
gddr5 memory frequency by 18 percent
improve frame rates in World War Z by 7
percent certainly not an amazing
overclock from the base model but I did
try to overclock the cause and that only
saw a one to two percent increase so
overclocking the memory is certainly the
way to go the 6 pin model did support
core and memory overclocking and the
memory went a little further they saw a
12 percent boost in performance placing
the gtx 1650 just behind a stock gtx
1063 gigabyte not exactly an impressive
result by overall but this is about the
best you can hope for from a gtx 1650
and World War Z performance gains when
testing with far cry new dorm were quite
similar
the base model was 7% faster once
overclocked while the 6 pin model was
14% faster again another nice
performance uplift for the 6 pin model
but even so it was slower than the stock
3 about 1060 and much slower than a
stock Radeon rx 570 we know force a
horizon fought to be quite a memory
sensitive title and therefore I wasn't
overly surprised to see the memory
overclock on the base model providing a
13% performance boost which was
comparable to the 15% performance boost
of the 6 pin model gain seen in
fortnight are reminiscent of what we
just saw in World War
and far cry new dawn and 8% boost for
the base model and 13% for the 6-pin
version then finally we have Resident
Evil 2 and here we see a slight
performance advantage out of the box
with a 6 p.m. model and then once
overclocked it enjoyed a 17 percent
performance bump and then 10% for the
base model well I have to admit I am
pleasantly surprised by this 75 watt
model the version that lacks the 6 pin
PCI Express power connector I had
thought it would be worse than it was
but yeah I mean it's not a particularly
good graphics card but like I said I was
expecting it to be worse than it was
so that is noticeably worse than this
card but yeah didn't turn out to be the
case to be fair though this is the best
or one of the best 75 watt models you
can get your hands on it is running
right on the edge there right up to the
edge of the power limit so there's just
absolutely no Headroom there for the
cause though it is only clocked
something like 3% above the official
Nvidia spec so it's not like the really
base base models are going to be a whole
lot slower so yeah I think it's fair to
say you can buy any 1650 and get pretty
similar performance to what we showed in
our day 1.5 review so the takeaway here
is if you're after a GTX 1650 and let's
not get into reasons if you're after a
GTX 1650 then your best bet is a base
model at or as close to the MSRP as you
can get in my opinion the gigabyte
gaming OC is a much better graphics card
than the base model OC version but it's
certainly not worth paying more than a
$10 premium for so at around $30 more it
is a hard pass of course it is my
opinion of the gtx 1650 series in itself
as a hard pass because for $20 less
shaking at an RX 570 which is overall a
faster graphics card and in most modern
titles much faster think something like
20% and yeah the RX 570 it does suck
down way more power which certainly is
an ideal but base model RX 570 is way
around 700 grams so they're still quite
cool and quiet but getting back to the
gtx 1650 if you're a mad scientist that
overclocked a gaming chair then there's
more fun to be had with two 6-pin models
and you can get them for as little as
160 dollars u.s. and I say that relative
to the MSRP
so that's just ten dollars over the MSRP
so I guess in an alternative universe
with the gtx 1650 is actually worth
buying i'd buy one of these models i'd
spend a little bit more to get a six pin
power connector because yeah you can
have a bit more fun overclocking it
sorry that brings me to the end of this
video but don't despair I've got more
gtx 1650 content planned yeah he says
everybody no but seriously I do want to
look into this whole PCIe power cable
debate a shocking number of people are
arguing the GTX 1650 is worthwhile and
that it's even a great graphics card
because models such as this one don't
require external power they can be used
in cheap OAM systems because of that and
it just makes them sort of a
cost-effective upgrade at least that is
the argument thing is I can't really
find those systems at least ones that
would warrant throwing in a hundred and
fifty dollar US graphics card so if you
guys can please post some candidate
systems below in the comments that would
be really helpful of the more
information the better and I'll look
into buying those pcs or at least seeing
how viable they are or how viable this
is as an upgrade for those pcs I've
already discussed this with our patreon
community on discord and they seem to
think the whole PCIe power cable this
thing is a bit of a crock these days one
member dug up the Dell Precision T 1600
workstation with a core i7 2670 Vasek
spin PCIe power connector and there
doesn't appear to be any spare 4-pin
molex cables to use with an adapter
thing is though with very very basic PC
building skills you can remove that
dumpster fire for PSU within like five
minutes and then replace it with a
quality 450 to 500 watt model for around
$35 u.s. thrown in our x5 70 yeah you've
spent fifteen dollars more than a GTX
1650 but you've got a significantly
better gaming graphics card that will no
doubt age considerably better and since
you're obviously a bit of a tight-ass
that'll mean big points for the radio
and GPU anyway I think that will do it
for this one I would like to just
quickly note that I did buy this
gigabyte graphics card and I have
nothing against gigabyte so I hate to
use them in
sort of- ish content i mean it's not
super negative but I just don't see a
point to these graphics cards and yeah
until I can prove that they do have a
point yeah I'm gonna stick to my opinion
frankly $150 us these are mainstream
graphics cards meant for mainstream
gaming and that doesn't mean people
using ten-year-old computers but anyway
apparently it does so we will look into
that in a separate piece of content but
I would like to just say thank you to
gigabyte for providing this card and the
the gtx 1660 which was a fantastic
product the 1660 ti also fantastic and
the ITX 2060 also quite a fantastic
product and gigabyte 1660 cards were the
best value options I found they provided
dual fan cards at pretty much MSRP
prices whereas competitors such as a
soos and maybe even an MS I didn't and
this particular model was better than
the MSI gaming X in terms of operating
temperature operating volume and all
that sort of stuff and overclocked a
little bit better as well so yeah I hate
to throw a gigabyte in the firing line
on this one if I have appreciate them
setting out cards and yeah they do make
quality cards they just can't do too
much about the gtx 1650 kind of sucking
in terms of cost per frame and well
that's something else i'll discuss in an
upcoming video as well I really want to
do a replying to comments episode on my
review of the 1650 because there's some
absolute parallel is there that I would
like to address but anyway we'll do that
in a separate video soon because I
haven't done a replying to comments for
a while and I think yeah we've got
plenty of material to work with
you know 1650 review but anyway
apologies to gigabyte if required and
yeah I think that's probably all I need
to say but anyway if you did enjoy the
video be sure to the like button
subscribe for more content and if you
appreciate the work we do her on box
where we buy graphics cards actual
retail cards so he can see what's going
on in different situations then yeah you
can support us on patreon because that
allows us to do that and you also get
some really awesome perks like you
become a member of our really cool
discord community you get to see our
livestream is behind the same videos and
yeah some other cool stuff anyway thank
you for watching I am your host Steve
and I will see you again next
