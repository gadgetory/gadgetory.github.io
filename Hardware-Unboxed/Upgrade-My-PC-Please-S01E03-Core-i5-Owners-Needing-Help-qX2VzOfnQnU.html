PC please if you missed the previous
episode or the video explaining what
this series is all about then be sure to
check those out I'll provide the links
in the video description so once again
in last week's episode we have five pcs
all in need of various upgrades these
were older potato type pcs and the
viewers voted Braden's old emic old the
most worthy of receiving the proposed
upgrades unlike the first episode last
week's was a bit of a landslide with you
guys heavily voting for old emic old so
congratulations to brain for winning the
$500 us upgrade package the good news of
course being that the four runners-up
will all be receiving a copy of Rainbow
six siege thanks to Ubisoft big thanks
to Ubisoft for supporting the series and
providing our contestants with free
games this week I'll be ordering
Braden's new parts from PC case gear and
getting them posted out to him PC case
key put their hand up right away to
support the series and offer free
shipping for all Australian based
contestants so a big thank you to them
also once installed we'll have Braden
sent us some updated photos of the
refurbished Riggin that I'll show them
off to you guys at a special feature at
the start of season 2 also don't forget
to vote each week is that will put you
in the ring to win some cool prizes and
that is of course a global giveaway last
week ET 3d from Israel won a Seagate
Barracuda 4 terabyte hard drive this
week we have another very cool prize on
offer I'll announce that a bit later in
the video but it may or may not be a
Rison 5 1600 CPU all right once again we
have 5 pcs all the need of various
upgrades let's go check them out first
up we have an old Sandy Bridge Core i5
PC from Aki which has been named a Kart
ski I hope I said that right anyway it
was built back in 2011 with just four
gigabytes of RAM and the pokey little
geforce GT 430 since then a few
difficult upgrades have been made a key
received the GeForce GTX 480 is a
hand-me-down from a relative so that was
a decent step up from the GT 430
however the Fermi based graphics card is
physically quite long as a result the
hacks all came out in the three and a
half inch drive bay got the chop so with
a bit of violence that problem was
solved quite
Klee the next problem as many of you
know Fermi is a hot item and with
limited case cooling a key had to whack
in a 120 millimeter fan on the side of
the case to feed in some fresh air the
GTX 480 also slayed the old power supply
so to solve that issue the EVGA
supernova 750 g2 was dropped in I'd
normally say that's extreme overkill but
then we are talking about a GTX 480
after all upgrading the memory was no
easy task either as it was discovered
that the second dim slot on the H 61
motherboard ended up being dead so a key
had to sell the 4 gigabyte sticks and by
a single aching about module 4 single
channel operation as a student a key
uses the PC for projects but like most
of us also enjoys the odd game
apparently stuttering is a serious
problem for titles such as Just Cause 3
and Resident Evil 7 using low to medium
quality settings so let's see what we
can do about that since we are dealing
with a locked core i5 CPU here a
platform upgrade really is in order
therefore I'm going to propose the
horizon 5 1400 on a gigabyte be 350
motherboard with 8 gigabytes of memory
this leaves us with enough cash to buy
either a new SSD or a case sadly though
there isn't enough money left over to
get something like a gtx 1050 so we'll
have to stick with that GTX 480 for now
a key can tackle that at a later date
for me the case really is a sad affair
and I can't imagine putting any new
hardware into that thing so I've picked
out the fractal design focus Mini G this
is a smart combo that will not just look
great but it'll also work very well next
up what is old made up - just waiting
for his games to load by the looks of it
Ray's dream is to up his game in 2017
with a more powerful gaming rig the
system you see here just below me here
was built by array with the help of
build guides over on the Whirlpool
forums and it's only purpose in life is
to game ray enjoys playing titles such
as csgo dota 2 and player unknowns
battlegrounds right now powering the rig
is the core i5 750 which has been
overclocked to three point four
gigahertz but Judy inadequate case
cooling has to be clocked back down to
the stock speeds during summer or the
system crashes
thermaltake v9 has a massive top mounted
230 millimeter exhaust fan and
unfortunately that's dead while the 120
millimeter fan in the rear is also dead
handling the rendering work is the
geforce gtx 960 4 gigabyte version which
is still decent while the operating
system is installed on the kingston v300
240 GB SSD so we're pretty good there as
well so really we are looking at a
platform upgrade here and there isin v
1400 again makes the most sense on our
budget well throw the rise in CPU on a
standard ATX motherboard from asrock
featuring the be 350 chipset along with
8 gigabytes of ddr4 memory since r8 has
a nice SSD power supply and decent
graphics card i've decided to solve the
case cooling issue by doing away with
the old thermal take v 9 and replacing
it with something a little more swanky
looking in the fan Tex eclipse p400s now
race pc won't just run cool it'll look
cool as well and we know how important
that is for a gaming rig get some RGB
ease in there and all year 2017 hopes
and dreams will have become a reality
this unassuming looking gaming rig
started life as a pre built HP back in
2013 but has since been upgraded from
the original Radeon HD 75-70 graphics
card and a gigabyte memory capacity it
also came with a hard drive as the boot
device but that has since been demoted
to secondary storage status when Carson
popped in the crucial MX 100 in fact
that's the system's most recent upgrade
before that in 2015 the graphics card
was upgraded to the very popular geforce
gtx 970 and another 8 gigabytes of ram
was added admittedly today it is a
reasonably respectable gaming system if
i'm honest but even so carson is chasing
better frame rates and titles such as
world of warcraft rust and Garry's Mod
apparently right now rust is only played
on low to medium quality settings and
there the frame rates aren't great so
the hope is to not just improve frame
rates but also the visual quality
settings so the heart of the system we
have the core i5
35 70 K clocked at 4.2 gigahertz which
in my opinion is quite a mild overclock
especially with the cooler master hyper
2 unto Evo even so at that frequency the
Ivy Bridge quad core is still an
exceptionally good gaming
and with our $500 us budget there really
isn't anything else we could afford that
would be a worthwhile upgrade since the
system does have a good sized SSD decent
power supply and plenty of RAM the
weakness here really is the graphics
card and possibly the old HP case
something like the GeForce GTX 1060 will
only really provide a minor bump in
framerate what we really need here is
something like a gtx 1070 for the
upgrade to be worthwhile so I suggest
the zotac gtx 10:17 mini this then
leaves us enough money left over to get
us a nice case something with better
thermal performance so I suggest the
fractal design focus gee it's a nice
looking affordable case that comes with
a pair of front mounted 120 millimeter
fans next up we have captain kitten and
two years ago this was a sad old aimday
FX 6300 system rocking an EVGA GTX 460
graphics card today the FX CPU has been
ditched for a has well based Core i5 46
7ek nice choice there Rob meanwhile the
GTX 460 was swapped out for the Radeon
r9 270x the system is built inside the
impressive-looking fantex Eclipse P 400
and powering everything is the corsair C
600 with the cooler master hyper T 4
Robert really should be able to get a
solid overclock out of the core i5 4670
K and as it stands short of picking up
an unlocked core i7 there really isn't
much room for improvement here basically
what Rob wants is quicker boot up and
game load times and he hopes to upgrade
to a 1080p monitor in the near future so
he's seeking a more powerful graphics
card as well as an SSD right now he's
enjoying games such as GTA 5 battlefield
4 Skyrim but he also dabbles with a dope
Photoshop so gonna fix the boot times
and solve that issue of the random
mismatch of laptop hard drives
I suggest the crucial MX 300 525
gigabyte two-and-a-half inch SSD then to
spruce up the rendering performance
let's go with the geforce gtx 1066 you
buy a graphics card if Rob hasn't
already I suggest overclocking the 46 70
K and once he gets a new monitor the gtx
1066 gigabyte will be fully Unleashed
last but certainly not least we have
another Core i5
46 CM
powered game hurry this time from
Australia Jayden's ye olde PC is
actually quite respectable but of course
we have a $500 us budget here and that
translates into around $600 Aussie and
for that we can make a number of
upgrades jaden loves to gaming from 2005
to 2013 he was a proud member of the PC
master-race then in late 2013 I guess he
must have hit his head or something
because he decided to get an Xbox one
rather than upgrade his PC Jaden a shame
what we think he made anyway
thankfully before too long the
concussion must have worn off and Jayden
quickly became unimpressed with the
performance of his xbox and therefore
began planning his PC comeback good on
you mate
anyway in early 2014 Jayden did get his
life back on track at least his gaming
life as he built the PC you see here
today the PC is used to store his music
library act as a Plex server for movies
and TV shows and of course play games
such as pub G battlefield 1 and doom the
main issue here is that GeForce GTX 760
graphics card apart from being very slow
in today's games Jaden says it's also
starting an artefact quite a bit he also
plans stopped grade the monitor to a
high refresh rate panel in the near
future so I suggest to the msi gtx 1060
armour / c 6g that'll fit our budget
nicely and will provide the frame rates
needed that leaves us with around a
hundred and fifty dollars aussie to play
with and with that i was thinking maybe
we could get another 8 gigabytes of
memory or perhaps even a bigger SSD
however jaden has requested if possible
could we throw in the fractal design
define see i thought the case he had was
pretty good but he doesn't like the
cable management and he wants something
with better cooling and easy to clean
dust filters so per his request I
suggest we throw on the define see the
tempered-glass edition now if you win
Jayden I expect to see a very smart
looking system build indeed alright guys
