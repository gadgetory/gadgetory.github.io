video has loads of benchmarks for you
i'm confident a lot of the testing is
really going to be of interest let's
hope so anyway also be aware this is
going to be a bit of a long-winded one
so if you're after a short sharp and to
a point video i can assure you that this
isn't that you've been warned
ok so recently i've conducted a heap of
gaming benchmarks and work out which
cpus from AMD and intel provide gamers
with the best experience and offer the
most value typically we found that intel
mainstream cpu still deliver the best
gaming performance thanks to a
combination of things really are
primarily the low latency ring bus
architecture and their ability to clock
up to around 5 gigahertz
despite that though we often hear from
viewers when making our head-to-head cpu
comparisons that rise ins a better
choice because it's more future proof
this came up over and over again when
comparing the core i5 8400 and risin 5
2600 the Rison cpu supports SMT
technology and therefore has twice as
many threads we heard it again when
comparing the horizon 720 700 x and core
i7 87 ok the 2700 x of course has two
extra cause now just to be crystal clear
we don't doubt for a second that those
extra CPU resources won't come into play
in the future and give aimed at a
serious advantage because they almost
certainly will the problem we have is
telling you to buy the 2700 X because we
think it will be faster for gaming in
the future it isn't that we don't think
that's true
we just don't know exactly when that
future will be speaking of future gaming
performance people still seem to get all
worked up about 720p benchmarking
screaming from the rooftops that it's
not an indicator of future performance
and that's actually true to a certain
extent although resolution CPU limited
benchmarking doesn't tell us how the
2,700 X 87 hurricane will compare in 10
years time that said we've never claimed
that it will I don't think anyone has I
believe it is a useful indicator for how
these CPUs compare in non GPU limited
scenarios for not just the games we have
available today the games that we're
currently testing but also the majority
of the games that will be released over
the next year possibly even the next
two years and let's be honest those
really are the titles that you should
care about when buying a CPU today
there's also more to low resolution
testing than just trying to predict near
future performance not everyone plays
using ultra quality type settings for
example using a gtx 1070 with
competitive settings will have a higher
ceiling than a gtx 1080i using ultra
quality settings in most titles above
all else though CPU limited results are
obviously very useful when analyzing CPU
performance and while it's also very
useful to see where the high end GPU
limitations come into play those aren't
the only results you want to pay
attention to anyway this video isn't
another 720p or low resolution
benchmarking discussion well and truly
over those for now and frankly have
become suspicious of anyone requesting
certain data sets be removed anyway what
I want to do with this video or try and
do with this video is work out how long
it will be before the 2700 X is a more
capable gamer than the 87 okay and we'll
do this using a few different methods
like I said I really don't expect games
to evolve greatly in the next year or
even the next two years for that matter
and we might get some core heavy games
perhaps battlefield 5 will be one of
them but for the most part were you
likely won't see any major change until
probably a year or so after the
next-generation consoles arrive since I
recently compared the horizon 727 her X
to the core i7 87 okay in 35 games and
many suggested that the 2700 X was the
better buyer for games because of those
two extra cause I wondered how true that
would eventually become once games
eventually max out eight core processors
and that's the thing it's not good
enough for a game to just utilize eight
course it has to max them out for the
2700 to have any chance of beating the
87 or okay at least by a convincing
margin the 2700 X might have 33% more
cores but with both CPUs overclocked the
8700 K clocks around 19% higher couple
that with the lower latency method of
connecting the course and ends up being
a pretty close battle with both CPUs
fully utilized truth be told there will
only be a narrow window in time before
the 2,700 X expires as a usable gaming
CPU where it will have a big advantage
over the 87
kay any way to explore all this we've
tested a number of different
configurations firstly I decided to turn
the 2700 X into a 2600 X by disabling to
cause one from each cc X so essentially
I could have just used a 2600 X but
don't worry about that too much it
doesn't really make any difference so
what we have are 6 second generation
risin cause with SMT enabled giving us
12 threads then for comparison we have
the core i7 8700 okay also with two
cores disabled essentially turning it
into a 77 or okay you might think well
that's a bit silly why not just use a 77
oh okay and well I could have but I
chose to use the 87 okay because it has
the full 12 megabyte level three cache
and therefore is better for comparing
how the 2700 X and 8700 K might compare
in the future
a typical overclock for the unlocked
coffee-like CPUs is about 5 gigahertz
while a typical
all core 2nd gen Rison overclock is 4.2
gigahertz so that's why we've chosen to
test at those frequencies unless you're
conducting an IPC test it makes no sense
at all to under clock the Intel CPU to
match the 4.2 gigahertz overclock of the
AMD CPU we've done all those kind of IPC
tests but for this one that's not what
we're trying to do because we're looking
at how these CPUs will shape up in the
future and anyone running an 87 ook
won't be doing it at 4.2 gigahertz on
the other side of that coin AMD
typically has more cores which is why
I'm making this video and while we're
giving the AMD CPUs a 2 core advantage
over the Intel parts finally both CPUs
were paired with ddr4 3400 memory with
tightened timings now for this one we've
only tested three games but before you
say that's not very hard unboxed of me
just know I've got almost 40 graphs to
go over and like I said a lot of
different configurations were tested the
game selection includes battlefield 1
ashes of the singularity and Deus Ex
mankind of Ireland all of which had been
benchmarked using the DirectX 11 and
DirectX 12 modes using both a gtx 1080i
and vegas 64 graphics card then wrapping
everything up we have some additional
core scaling performance to look at and
that is particularly interesting but get
to that after we do all the first batch
of results there really is a heap of
data to get through
would blast through it because it's not
that interesting and others will have a
good chat about so let's jump into it
I'm going to kick things off with ashes
of singularity because I know you guys
love this title starting with the
DirectX 11 testing using the extreme
preset with the GTX 1080i this is what
we found and I should note that under
these conditions the Intel CPU saw an
average utilization of 88% with a peak
of 100 percent while the AMD CPU
averaged 51 percent with a peak of just
66% ok so here we see that the Intel CPU
was faster at all three resolutions
under these test conditions we're not
able to take full advantage of the
horizon CPU even with six cores enabled
so that is a bit of a problem swapping
to Vegas 64 changed a few things firstly
the performance between the CPUs is much
more competitive and aim Lieven hits the
lead in a few tests however the game
appears almost broken now at times we
see frame time performance taking a
serious nosedive Vegas 64 really isn't
enjoying ashes of the singularity using
the older dx11 API so we'll switch to
DirectX 12 and check those results out
in a moment before we do jump to the
DirectX 12 results here's how the game
performs using the standard quality
preset here the average framerate is
similar but Intel has a notable
advantage for the frame time results the
Vegas 64 results are again much the same
similar average framerate performance as
seen with surprisingly poor frame time
results so let's move on to the DirectX
12 results to see what they have for us
moving to the DirectX 12 API we do see
slightly better CPU utilization for the
AMD CPU and as a result we do see more
competitive performance now the rise in
CPU was able to nudge your head at 720p
and 1080p using Vegas 64 doesn't change
much here the margins are all quite
similar so let's move on to check out
these standard quality settings with the
standard quality settings enabled on the
DirectX 12 API we see slightly ever so
slightly better performance using the
Intel CPU with the GTX 1080i swapping to
Vegas 64 provides mixed results for the
most part performance was much the same
but we do see the AMD and Intel CPUs
trading blows under these test
conditions okay so that wraps up the
ashes of the singularity testing let's
move on to Battlefield 1 up first we
have the DirectX 11 results using the
ultra quality settings with the GTX 10
ATT I hear the four core coffee like CPU
was able to beat the six core second gen
rise in part though it has to be said
the margins were minimal switching to
Vega 64 mix things up a bit and now the
second generation CPU can be seen
delivering stronger performance at 1080p
and 1440p the margins aren't huge but
Rison is clearly faster here here we see
that reducing the GPU bottleneck with
the medium quality settings does play
into Intel's hands when using the gtx
980ti
here the four core coffee like CP was up
to 14% faster using vega 64 we see the
Intel CPU still takes the lead at 720p
and 1080p but was slower at 1440p
falling behind the rise in CPU by a 5%
margin now we're switching to the
DirectX 12 API and once again using the
gtx 1080i we see intel has a clear
performance advantage when not GPU
limited this time we see when using
vegas 64 the frame rates are much more
comparable but even so having two extra
cause doesn't give rise and a noteworthy
advantage reducing the GPU bottleneck
further with the medium quality setting
sees the quad-core Intel CPU delivering
up to 18% more performance with the GTX
1080i then with Vegas 64 this reduces
that margin quite significantly but even
so the Intel CPU is still up to 6
percent faster ok so now we have the
Deus Ex mankind divided results and when
using the dx11 api the four core Intel
system saw a peak CP utilization of 64%
with an average utilization of 57% we
saw slightly higher numbers for the 6
core AMD system hitting 63% on average
with a maximum utilization of 70% using
the GTX 280 eye the Intel CPU was up to
15% faster though as we increase the GPU
bottleneck with the higher resolutions
that margin does shrink with Vegas 64
the GPU bottleneck is introduced much
earlier and this means that a DP the CPU
performance is pretty well neutralized
the lower 720p resolution does help to
avoid this GPU limitation and here the
Intel CPU was 11% faster dropping down
to the medium quality preset with the
gtx 1080i reduces the GPU bottleneck and
now the Intel quad-core configuration is
up
21% faster Vega 64 also allows the CPUs
to stretch their legs a bit more with
the medium quality settings here the
Intel CPU was up to 12 percent faster
switching to the DirectX 12 API with the
GTX 1080i doesn't help out the rise and
CPU and here we see some very odd
behavior although we're not CPU bound
the results certainly appear as there we
are as the Intel configuration is
limited to around 87 to 89 fps and the
AMD configuration eighty to eighty one
FPS we see the same odd behavior with
Vegas 64 when using the DirectX 12 API
unfortunately not all or rather not many
DirectX 12 titles are as well put
together as ashes of the singularity
even with the medium quality preset we
see the same odd behavior with the GTX
1082 I and the same can be said for
Vegas 64 as well not much else to say
here really so let's move on from the
Deus Ex mankind divided testing okay so
whopping 2 calls off the 80 seminar okay
and the 2700 give the rise and CPA
noteworthy advantage in today's games
Davis X mankind divided is a bit of a
poor example it has to be said of a
tunnel that utilizes many cause but it's
also fairly typical example of how most
games behave battlefield 1 is extremely
cool heavy and you'll see further
performance improvements when enabling
are those extra cores on both CPUs so
that is to say enabling all the cores
and the 27 hundreds will make it a
little bit faster than say the 2600 X
even so in those two tiles we saw a very
few examples where the six core second
gen rising CP was faster than the four
core coffee-like CPU in fact when using
the GeForce GTX t2i we saw almost no
examples with the exception of a single
benchmark and that was ashes of the
singularity are using the extreme
quality settings with the DirectX 12 API
the rise in CPU had a little more
success with Vegas 64 but even so there
wasn't any tests that really favored the
AMD CPU by a notable margin the four
core Intel CPU did often hit 100%
utilization when testing with
battlefield one and ashes at the
singularity and we saw the average
utilization hovering around 90% which is
obviously quite high the problem though
is that the same tests these same test
conditions saw the rise in CPU are very
underutilized hitting around 40% on
average and
I'll fill one about 50 to 60% in ashes
of the singularity for those extra cause
of the rise and see for you to really be
of an advantage we need to see the AMD
CPU hitting around 80 to 100 percent
utilization and this would mean that the
Intel CPU would be overwhelmed at a
constant 100% so for such a test we've
taken battlefield 1 again and we've
tested scaling performance using a range
of Core configurations the coffee-like
CPU has been benchmarked with two four
and six cores enabled while the second
gen rising CPU has been tested with four
six and eight cores enabled and remember
all configurations still have SMT
enabled again I've tested using both the
DirectX 11 and DirectX 12 api's but this
time I will be dropping Vegas 64 and
just testing with the GTX 1080i as that
shows us ultimately what we are looking
for right so these results probably tell
us all we need to know but even so I'm
gonna go through all the results we have
for the CPU scaling mostly because we
have them and I'm sure you guys are
still interested in taking a look
I say these results tell us all we need
to know because you can clearly see the
tipping point where AMD's core advantage
comes into play the drop down from 6 to
4 course for the coffee like
architecture in this title see is just a
6 percent reduction in framerate and
we're basically seeing the same
reduction for these second gen rise in
architecture and dropping down from 8 to
6 cause then when dropping down from 6
to 4 course for the second gen rise in
architecture we see a rather large 15
percent drop-off in performance however
what you want to pay attention to here
is the massive 29 percent performance
degradation seen for the coffee-like
architecture when dropping from 4 cores
down to just 2 cores
so do remember SMT is enabled for both
architectures basically what this means
is right now for AMD's core count
advantage to be realized we have to be
playing with two core for thread Intel
CPUs but before getting into that too
much let's just check out the rest of
the results really quickly using the
medium quality preset to help reduce the
GPU bond that we see similar performance
margins for the 8 and 6 core battles as
well as these 6 and 4 core battles but
the margin for the 2 versus 4 core
battle grows from 15% in favor of
horizon 2 almost 30%
again we see similar performance margins
at 1080p here the eight core rise in CPU
isn't that far behind the six core
coffee-like CPU while it crushes it when
making the four core verses - cool
comparison we see pretty much the same
thing when using the medium quality
settings though the turnaround here for
the lower core count comparison looks
more dramatic
then at 1440p we see that for the most
part the rise in CPU is able to maximize
the gtx 1080 eyes performance and we
only see a slight slip in performance
for the four core configuration then
using the medium quality settings shows
basically the same performance trends
switching to the DirectX 12 API shows
just how badly in videos drivers hurt
their eyes and CPUs as we see very
little shift in performance from the
four core to the eight core
configuration that said as was the case
with DirectX 11 testing the Intel
coffee-like
architecture does fall behind once
overwhelmed with just two cores
similar performance trends are seen with
the medium quality settings at 720p
videos drivers do become less of an
issue at this slightly more GPU limited
Tony P resolution but in any case we see
a similar performance trend the same can
also be said when looking at the 1080p
medium quality results then finally at
1440p we are quite heavily GPU limited
and here while slower the two core
coffee-like CPU configuration wasn't
that much slower even when looking at
the frame time performance of course if
we reduce the quality settings the
margin does open back up and again we
see the four core eyes and CP offers a
clear performance advantage over the two
core Intel CPU something we don't see
when comparing the four core Intel CPU
to the six core verison CPU so quite a
bit to go over here but I'll do my best
to explain the results the most
revealing of all the tests were the
battlefield 1 cost scaling results here
we could quite clearly see that having
two extra cause isn't particularly
useful today for AMD we're looking at
the four and six core Intel CPUs so that
would be the AMD CPUs with six and eight
cores they're just not getting utilized
and we just not putting them to good use
so unfortunately for AMD that kind of
puts Intel in a good position because
most of their range does feature four to
six cores these days they don't
necessarily have SMT enabled that is
something that the core i3 and Core i5
models do
miss out on anyway what we've quite
clearly found is that in order for AMD's
extra course to come into play the Intel
CPUs have to be completely maxed out
it's hardly surprising that one but it
is worth being reminded of as we
discussed the results essentially what
this means is for the horizon 720 700 X
to beat the core i7 87 or okay we need
games where the 2700 x ccp utilization
hovering around 80 to 90 percent and
that is opposed to the 20 to 40 percent
we are currently seeing right now so how
long till the core i7 87 or okay is
overwhelmed and the 2700 X offers a
noteworthy performance advantage it's
really hard to say but it's likely not
going to happen in the next few years
in fact it's likely going to be a few
years before we even see the six core 12
third rising configuration hands down
beating a fork or eight thread
coffee-like CPU if such a CPU existent
let's say the core i7 7700 K and
remember we are accounting for intel's
current 19% clock speed advantage when
overclocked so when some people say get
the rise in cpu because it has more
cores and therefore will be better for
gaming in the future i really have to
question just how far into the future
they expect this changing of the gaurd
to occur if right now in 2018 using some
of the most CPU demanding games we have
you need to compare a fork or eight
threaded AMD CPU to a two core for
thread Intel CPU in order for it to win
how long is it going to be before we see
this with double the core count honestly
I hate to think of course when it comes
to non-related gaming tasks using
applications that can take advantage of
the extra cores and threads that rise
and offers there is a real advantage to
be had and this is why we often
recommend the rise in CPUs we're also
well aware that for the most part gaming
performance is GPU limited and second
generalize it is close enough to coffee
like in terms of frame rate muhammad's
for any difference to go unnoticed and
this is largely because under most
conditions there is no actual difference
that being the case can you fall back on
the argument the rise on has more cores
and therefore will be better for gaming
in the future well given that in today's
games there are indeed
very similar and one day what will
hopefully be a not-too-distant future
those extra cause could mean the
difference between smooth playable
performance and a stuttering mess so
that being the case you probably can
however I wouldn't hold your breath it's
likely you'll upgrade your platform once
or twice before those extra calls come
in handy for gaming and that is gonna do
it for this one I hope you enjoyed this
