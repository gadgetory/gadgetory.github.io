for yet another big benchmark video so
strap yourself in last week and video
released the geforce gtx 1070 Ti and I
suffered through the launch with some
kind of flu virus but the good news is
I've just about fully recovered now
because I was sick though that did limit
my time and energy I had to throw out
the release day coverage so I promised
you that I would put together a 34 game
benchmark comparing the gtx 1070 TI and
nine other GPUs and well this is that
video I've actually added a 35th game
and that is Call of Duty World War 2 all
35 games were tested at IUP 1440p and 4k
resolutions and this means that we have
a grand total of 105 grafts comprising
of eleven hundred and fifty five
individual benchmark runs the results as
always are based on an average of three
runs and so that means there's three
thousand four hundred and sixty five
runs in total or well at least to that
amount anyway
this took weeks of work together and the
issue on our face is how to present all
this data without taking up a week of
your time so what we're gonna do here is
focus on a doesn't have the most
recently released and most interesting
games and then look at a number of head
to head comparisons based on all 35
games you know those massive graphs you
guys seem to really love they usually
show at the end of the big benchmark
comparisons anyway because I have
exported and manually highlighted the
GPUs that we're discussing at all 105
graphs I've decided to include them all
at the end of this video with a bit of
background music so consider it kind of
like showing the workings out if you
will for you guys that are interested to
see how the frame rates looked in
individual games at certain resolutions
you can go and check those at the end of
the video anyway first that we have 12
games to closely look at before jumping
into the full breakdown graphs before
that there are a few quick notes on
testing the latest AMD and NVIDIA
drivers were used and all tests were
conducted on my new core i7 ATS owner
okay
test system previously many of these
results were gathered on my 77 okay test
system but they've been since retested
on the 87 are ok many of them went
unchanged but I did see a couple of big
changes in games such as ashes of the
singularity for example so that pretty
much covers all the boring stuff it's
now time to jump into the results
kick-starting things we have the call of
duty at World War 2 results starting
with the 1080p resolution now right away
you've no doubt noticed something a bit
odd here all the Radeon based graphics
cards are stuck at an average of 91 fps
this is obviously a driver issue as
Vegas 64 liquid-cooled should be quite a
lot faster than an RX 580 for example in
fact all the AMD GPUs were slower than
the GTX 1060 at this resolution moving
to 1440p we again find that the Radeon
GPUs are limited to around 90 FPS on
average though this time the RX 580 does
drop off a little bit still because of
this issue the gtx 1070 TI is a little
over 20% faster than the vega 56
graphics card before we even bothered or
overclocked it finally at the extreme 4k
resolution that apparent 90 FPS cap of
the AMD GPUs is no longer an issue as
there is no single GPU here able to
achieve that level of performance even
so Nvidia still has the edge in this
tile at least when comparing the gtx
1070 TI and vega 56 GPUs here the gtx
1070 TI was 8 percent faster while it
was possible to extract a further 11%
via for clocking moving on we have
Assassin's Creed origins and here we
have another new tire what looks to be
favoring the green team the GTX 1070 Ti
provided 9 percent more frames in Vega
56 and this meant at 1080p it was
pushing well over 60 fps at all times
the margin is diminished at 1440p and
here the 1070 - I was just 7% faster
when comparing the average frame rate
that said though the minimum result
weighed heavily in the green team's
favor then finally at 4k the 1070 - I
was just 3% faster with an average of 36
fps though again it was a good bit
faster for the minimum frame rate that's
it with less than 40 fps on average
neither GPU was particularly impressive
at the 4
pear resolution when using the very high
quality preset next that we have the new
Wolfenstein game often signed to the new
Colossus like doom this title supports
the Vulcan API so you might expect the
AMD GPUs to do very well here Vega 56 is
able to outpace the gtx 1070 TI even
once the NVIDIA GPU is overclocked that
said those things do change slightly at
1440p and here Vega 56 is just 7% faster
than these stock gtx 1070 TI this time
overclocking the 1072 i places at on par
with the Vega GPU impressively both GPUs
are averaging over 100 FPS using the
maximum in game quality preset then
finally at 4k we are still able to
achieve very playable performance again
value 56 is still slightly faster when
comparing both GPUs at their default
operating frequencies both Vega 56 and
the gtx 1070 I performed very well in f1
2017 now this time the green team has a
clear advantage in this DirectX 11 title
the margins aren't huge but out of the
box the 1070 Ti is faster than Vega 56
though the Vega Ravi's card does beat
the plain old 1070 the margins close up
at 1440p and though the 1072 AI is still
faster there's now just a few frames in
it so not really much to talk about
there again this is a title where
previously or I suppose still currently
AMD's Vega 56 does enjoy a win over the
1070 but 1070 CI though does tip things
back in invidious favour then finally at
the extreme 4k resolution the gtx 1070
TI remains in the lead though again
there really isn't that much in it
Middle Earth shadow of war is another
recently released title and this one
plays very nicely with AMD Hardware as a
result Vega 56 is faster than even the
gtx 1070 TI at least a stock gtx 1070 TI
here the red team enjoyed a 12%
performance advantage over the vanilla
1070 at 1080p and 3% over the new TI
model similar margins were seen at 1440p
though this time i should know that
overclocked in the gtx 1070 TI did boost
the frame rates by 11% and consequently
this meant that it was 6% faster than
the stock vega 56 Jeep
you then for those gaming at the 4k
resolution you will need to reduce the
quality preset as the GTX 1072 Ione Vega
56 GPUs were only good for like 40 fps
jumping back in the cockpit this time
for project cars too we find another
racing simulator that prefers its cars
with a shade of green at 1080p the stock
out-of-the-box GTX 1072 I matched the
Vega sixty-four liquid cooled graphics
card while overclocking plates to the
$450 GeForce graphics card within the
1080 TI's slipstream I should note
though thanks to what is a fairly
obvious CPU bottleneck that slow slow
8700 K at 5 gigahertz is unfortunately
the culprit here jumping to 1440p the
CPU bottleneck is alleviated as the GPU
has much more to deal with now the
margin between Vega 56 and the gtx 1070
TI grew ever so slightly and now the
GeForce graphics card is 13% faster out
of the box then finally at the 4k
resolution the margin again grows and
now the gtx 1070 is 15% faster than vega
56 and as a consequence is now hot on
the heels of vega 64 liquid-cooled once
again moving on now we have destiny to
to check out and things look very
similar to what we saw in testing the
beater out last month by that I mean
this game pretty much favors hardware
from the green team that said though
previously the GTX 1070 did beat Vega 56
by a pretty handy margin an au value is
slightly ahead so AMD has made some
improvements unfortunately though for
AMD since then nvidia has of course
released the gtx 1070 Ti and that kind
of hides some of the gains they've made
with Vega 56 having said that there at
1440p things really do turnaround for
the Radeon GPUs and here we can see Vega
56 beating the GTX 1070 Ti even once
it's overclocked so that's a very
interesting and certainly very
impressive result for AMD what's more
interesting there are the 4k results as
here AMD continues to gain momentum and
now vega 56 is 15 percent faster than
the overclocked gtx 1070 TI in fact vega
64 liquid-cooled is able to
the GTX 10 atti and well you don't see
that too often
total war war hammer 2 was tested using
the DirectX 12 API and this should give
AMD a slight advantage that said in
videos drivers are already appear to be
pretty much up to speed and working well
in this title and as a result the GTX
1070 Ti is just three percent slower
than Vega 56 at 1080p so I think we
should probably increase the resolution
as we've already done numerous times and
see if that pushes things further in
AMD's favor like what we saw with
destiny 2 well this time things actually
closed up at the 1440p resolution and
now Vega 56 and the stock GTX 1072 I
deliver virtually the same performance
this is again also seen at the 4k
resolution as both GPUs deliver an
average of 24 fps he'll blades built
upon the Unreal 4 engine typically this
engine favors in video hardware and we
can certainly see that here the gtx 1070
TI was a whopping 19% fast in the vega
56 in what was one of the most
convincing wins for nvidia yet the
margin though is reduced ever so
slightly at 1440 p.m. now the gtx 1070
TI is 16% faster even before the 1072 I
arrived though Nvidia is plain old 1070
had AMD more than covered in this title
again we see similar margins even at the
extreme 4k resolution though as usual
the hoh's gaming here will want to
reduce the quality settings if they plan
on using either a Vega 56 or gtx 1070 TI
type graphics card another game released
this year that also uses the Unreal 4
game engine is player on owns
battlegrounds and this is yet another
title it prefers in video hardware it's
not exactly a well-built title though
it's certainly not optimized at least to
the degree that you would expect from a
title of its popularity let's say and
well I really only include it because of
how popular it is the GTX 1072 I led
Vega 56 by 32% margin that's not exactly
the norm but it's still a disappointing
result for AMD in this hugely popular
title as we often see the margin is
reduced at 1440p that said it's still
quite a massive margin in favour of the
G
Falls graphics Carter's here it was 28%
faster then at the 4k resolution the
1072 I was 24% faster but it hardly
matters at this point with almost every
graphics card tested struggling Oh chief
30 frames per second from a terribly
optimized game to an extremely well
optimised game we now have the prey
results this games provide us with
plenty of competitive results in the
past and this is again true here though
the updated gtx 1070 TI now has the
rendering power to pull ahead of vega 56
the results though are quite interesting
as with the 1070 TI you do get the
minimum frame rate of the gtx 1080
but the average result is much closer to
the gtx 1070 so that's quite curious I
have for the most part the margins
though were much the same at 1440p here
the gtx 1070 I led Vega 56 by 10% margin
while it enjoyed a 12% boost
once overclocked then at 4k the margins
remain much the same though now we're
seeing frame rates in the 40s the last
game that we're gonna have a close look
at is dirt 4 and we found that this
title does heavily favor the red team
when using any anti-aliasing method
other than the ultra heavy 8 times MSAA
I've always used CMAA as it looks quite
good and it's not very taxing on
performance here value 56 berries the
gtx 1070 TI and it does seem like in
videos driver team are unable to make up
this massive deficit at 1440p the margin
is reduced but even so Vega 56 was 17%
faster than the stock gtx 1070 TI
finally at 4k Vega 56 seems to choke a
little and now the gtx 1070 TI is ample
and matches performance with 61 FPS this
is quite an impressive result for these
graphics cars at this extreme resolution
lastly just a quick recap on power
consumption we looked at this a few days
ago in the day one coverage of the gtx
1070 TI and there was there are a few
more cards let's say in that comparison
there is yourself you want a bit more
detail go back and check that anyway as
you can see the power consumption
between vega 56 and the gtx 1070 TI when
comparing full-system draw is very
similar obviously the pascal base 10 70
TI is much more efficient as it was
faster overall but managed to draw less
power right so we've now looked
36 of the 105 graphs let's skip the rest
now and break down the data I've
gathered from all 35 games I've mostly
focused on the 1440p resolution as I
feel this is the most relevant for GPUs
of this caliber overclocking really
wasn't the focus this video and I
realize I didn't overclock Vega 56 so
it's not an overclocking comparison that
said though you kind of have to
overclock the 1070 TI for it to make
sense otherwise you might as well to
spend a little extra on the 1080 or save
a bit and get the 1070 anyway as you can
see here once overclocked the gtx 1070
TI produces on average around 11% more
frames which isn't bad it's certainly
worth the small amount of effort it
takes to achieve of course the gains
will vary quite a bit depending on the
title use for testing but as you can see
for the most part you will see
double-digit gains when compared to
MSI's factory overclocked gtx 1070
gaming x graphics card these stock gtx
1070 TI was an average just 8% faster
which might seem a bit surprising given
that the 1070 TI packs 27% more cuda
cores there are however two reasons why
that margin might be smaller than
expected firstly the MSI gaming X
version of the gtx 1070 features a
factory overclock whereas the 1070 TI
doesn't so this does help reduce the
margin the other reason being that the
gtx 1070 TI is memory starved and this
means all those extra criticals aren't
really being utilized as effectively as
they should be
overclocking the 1070 TI's memory really
does help out as you're about to see now
with my custom overclock applied the
1070 I is 20% faster than the msi gtx
1070 gaming ex model in fact we're now
saying up to a 28% gain and tiles such
as fir honor f1 2017 doom and the
division with both the 1070 and 1070 ti
overclocked to the max the TR model
should be I would say at least 15%
faster on average overclock the 1070 TI
is also able to deliver factory
overclocked GT X 1080 light performance
as it matched the MSI gaming X mile
they were evenly matched in six other
games tested while the overclock 1072 I
was faster in 11 games albeit by just a
1 to 2% margin in most of them
additionally the 1070 I was never more
than 5 percent slower so you can safely
say it delivers at least stock GG X 1080
performance once overclocked in my big
32 game Vega benchmark video though did
a few months ago now I found that Vega
56 was an average 5 percent faster than
the geforce gtx 1070 founders edition at
the time i noted that the factory
overclocked custom board partner
versions of the gtx 1070 would be around
5% faster than the founders edition
model so overall the 1070 and Vega 56
graphics cards would deliver similar
performance well this time for the 35
game benchmark which includes many new
and previously untested games I've used
the MSI gaming X version of the gtx 1070
and here we see it was just 1% slower
than vega 56 on average so that's about
what I was expecting to find
newly-released titles that helped AMD
out include Wolfenstein 2 shadow of war
Warhammer 2 and destiny 2 the big wins
for Nvidia came from player unknowns
battlegrounds Mass Effect Andromeda and
the newly released Call of Duty World
War 2 title so prior to the gtx 1070
TI's release AMD were still hanging in
there with a pretty close head-to-head
battle with the factory overclocked n
70's however if we now swap to the 1070
Ti we find that on average this new
GeForce GPU was 6% faster at 1440p in
fact the 1070 TI was faster in 25 of the
30 games test and only suffered a
double-digit loss in dirt floor and
destiny 2 so in today's games it's fair
to say that for the most part the
geforce gtx 1070 TI is the superior GPU
before wrapping things up i also checked
out the margins at 1080p and here the
1072 i made out a little better it's
certainly the better option for those
seeking extreme frame rates at this
resolution the only game to really hurt
the 1070 I was again dirt 4 but for
those that would claim this is an
outlier and it's skews the results I can
tell you that it doesn't that's the
beauty of testing with so many games of
course removing dirt 4 does only change
the margin by a percent and that set up
we memory of Call of Duty World War two
unsurprisingly we're back to a 7% margin
and then finally we have the 4k
resolution and in my opinion neither of
these GPUs are really capable of 4k
gaming but you know here are the results
anyway the gtx 1070 TI was 6% faster on
average at this extreme resolution again
the 1072 i was faster in the majority of
the games tested well is there anything
else that needs to be said I guess at
this point it pretty much comes down to
pricing availability performance wise
you're looking at around 6 percent on
average and the difference between these
2 cards and again that is just the
average difference across the 35 games
tested so if you plan on playing a
shipload of pub G for example the gtx
1070 TI is the obvious choice it was 28%
faster at 1440p in that title so though
if you're gonna mostly play something
like destiny 2 then perhaps Vega 56
would be the way to go as the 1072 I was
11% slower in that tile that said that I
think if you're gonna play a mix of
games and that's probably sort of
realistic for most to you guys you're
not going to stick to all one title I
know some people do but yeah anyway if
you're gonna play a mix of titles and I
think it's safe to say that the nvidia
geforce gtx 1070 TI is the best bet
right now as always i suggest you look
at the performance in the games that
interest you to work out which brands
gonna serve you best keeping the
performance figures in the back of the
old noggin
let's talk Mahler in a post
cryptocurrency mining apocalypse when
MSRP z' actually mean something again
for the gtx 1070 TI should cost $450 us
the gtx 1070 $380 us and the gtx 10
$8,500 us and finally vega 56 should
cost around $400 us actually to my
surprise at the time of creating this
video it was possible to buy a vega 56
graphics card for $400 us and a gtx 1070
TI for 450 dollars us what kind of
madness is this hopefully this is still
the case when you watch this video i
kind of don't believe it but over Amazon
and Newegg those are the prices I'm
currently seeing this means the gtx 1070
TI cost around 13% more than a reference
vega 56 graphics cutting honestly that
makes picking between the two a bit of a
challenge here in australia the pricing
is much the same for both models you can
expect to pay around 700 to 750 dollars
Ozzy so keeping those prices in mind I'm
not really sure why the gtx 1070 CIA has
been copying so much hate especially
from some of the big-name reviewers out
there sure i'll admit it's an exciting
and i did say this in my day 1 review
but right now it is only $40 u.s. more
than a 1070 and that's 10% more and with
both overclocked it is around 15% faster
that's hardly exciting gains I know but
for someone buying a new graphics card
today it is the better value option at
least for enthusiasts that keen on
overclocking that said that I can
certainly understand the argument that
if you're gonna spend four hundred and
fifty dollars why not just spend five
hundred or at the moment it's five
hundred and ten dollars to secure the
gtx 1080 it is just 13% more after all
at the five hundred and ten dollar price
as I said in my review the gtx 1070 TI
it really does fill a gap that we didn't
really need filled but it seems Nvidia
just doesn't want to give AMD an inch in
the end though if I had to pick between
a reference Vega 56 graphics card at
$400 or a custom board partner gtx 1070
TI at 450 dollars i think i'd lean
towards the GeForce graphics card for
the simple fact that in most games does
provide superior performance consumes
less power
albeit only slightly less runs cooler
and is a heck of a lot quieter operating
volume really is the big issue for me
with the reference Vega 56 graphics card
it's loud I don't care what anyone says
it's bloody loud and I certainly
couldn't live with it I am hoping to get
my hands on a custom Vega 56 graphics
cards soon but boy oh boy it's not an
easy task and good luck if you're a
consumer in the end I think the gtx 1070
TI wins juda better availability
significantly more options for
consumers to choose from and better
quality options at that there is still
hope for Vega but with each passing
month that hope is dwindling and I'd say
AMD's GPU armors now pretty much on life
support everything would have to be
hinged on the next generation which
could really make or break the Radeon
team as it is in videos basically ganged
up on Vega 56 the gtx 1070 was already
really giving it a hard time I what was
a bit of a back-and-forth fight but now
the gtx 1070 TI is just shamelessly
jumped into the ring to kick Vega
while the 1070 holds it down Vega 64
would no doubt like to step in and help
but it's already been dropped punted
across the ring by the GTX 1080 and the
liquid cool model wet itself at the site
of the GT X 1080 TOI I could go along
with this story but I'll spare you and
stop here and instead I'm gonna hit you
with 69 more graphs and though that
wasn't intentional hey I'm your host
Steve again sorry about my voice it is
getting better I should be fully
recovered in a few days time but until
then here is a truckload of blue bar
graphs enjoy
