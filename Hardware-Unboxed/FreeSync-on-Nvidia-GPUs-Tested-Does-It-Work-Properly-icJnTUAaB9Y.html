going to be testing a new feature that
NVIDIA has just enabled in their latest
drivers and that support for free sync
moderates
this was first announced at CES 2019 to
the surprise of the community I think
I'm not sure many people were expecting
Nvidia to back down from their g-sync
Tower but they have and finally those
with NVIDIA GPUs can now use adaptive
sync with a wide range of free sync
monitors now you might be thinking wide
range that's not riding video only
announced that 12 monitors would be
supported but that's actually not the
case
Nvidia announcement of this feature was
a little misleading in my opinion so
I'll do my best to clarify it here
Nvidia support for adaptive sync
displays now comes in the form of four
tiers yes four tier so it's pretty
confusing at the top is g-sync ultimate
the new name for g-sync HDR monitors
that are g-sync ultimate certified have
Nvidia g-sync HDR module inside and
support basically the full suite of HDR
features juicing ultimate monitors
include the ASA predator X 27 the Isuzu
rog swift PG 27 UQ and the new HP omen X
Imperium 65 one step down is regular
g-sync these are the monitors that we've
had for many years now that include a
juicing module but don't support juicing
HDR these are the adaptive sync monitors
that have always worked with NVIDIA GPUs
and NVIDIA GPUs only and the ones that
command a higher price tag than their
free sync counterparts then we get down
to gsync compatible monitors these are
free sync monitors that NVIDIA has
certified to pass their strict J sync
performance metrics they don't have a
g-sync module but they do support the
vasa adaptive sync standard so they also
work with AMD GPUs with the latest in
video drivers these monitors now work
with adaptive sync on NVIDIA GPUs with
adaptive sync enabled by default so far
NVIDIA has announced that 12 monitors
are g-sync compatible you can see the
list here if you're on any of these
monitors and install the latest driver
adaptive sync will be enabled
automatically and you can use it just
like you would with any other j sync
monitor Nvidia claims that G
think compatible is still inferior to
regular old g-sync they have this table
here showing that g-sync monitors are
certified with more image quality tests
have a full variable refresh rate range
variable overdrive and our factory color
calibrated however there is really no
reason why g-sync compatible monitor
couldn't also be factory calibrated or
have a full variable refresh rate range
in video just isn't requiring these
things for the monitor to receive a J
sync compatible sticker while g-sync
monitors must have those features
there's also a fourth tier that Nvidia
only talks about briefly and that's the
ability to use any free sync or Vaser
adaptive sync monitor with an NVIDIA GPU
via a toggle in the Nvidia control panel
Nvidia claims that this is for vrr or
variable refresh rate monitors yet to be
validated as chasing compatible and says
that when enabling the feature it may
work it may work partly or it may not
work at all and of course in video wants
you to think you have to purchase a
decent compatible monitor to know for
sure that it works
so despite Nvidia announcing the g-sync
compatible program with just 12
supported monitors out of 400 tested in
reality every adaptive sync monitor is
now supported all you have to do is
enable the toggle and away you go
sure only certified monitors are
guaranteed to work but Nvidia isn't
restricting you to just g-sync
compatible monitors every free sync
monitor should work now Nvidia they did
spend a bit of time during their keynote
and on the show floor attempting to
convince people that the g-sync
compatible program actually is necessary
because apparently non-certified
monitors are rife with issues they
showed off monitors that were flickering
and blanking and basically used those
examples to tarnish the entire freesync
ecosystem Nvidia were effectively saying
that the G syncing compatible monitors
they've certified to not have these
issues while any non certified monitors
will have issues which is why you need
to purchase a chase ink compatible
monitor as soon as I saw in the video
talking about these issues I immediately
called BS and that's because these
issues they showed off and not issues
with free sync or the phaser adaptive
sync standard they're not issues
inherent to the technology instead they
issues with monitor manufacturers
producing a crappy product it's no
secret
some precinct monitors especially
earlier models aren't very good and do
indeed have issues like flickering even
on AMD GPUs but those monitors are
pretty much just rubbish in my opinion
if you receive a monitor that flickers
or has blanking issues it's a defective
product that should be returned there
are plenty of monitors that don't have
any such issues so I wasn't a fan of
Nvidia claiming that non-certified
monitors will definitely have these
sorts of problems firstly a quick look
at how exactly you enable adaptive syncs
support for non-certified monitors once
you've installed driver version 4 1771
or newer all you have to do is open up
the in-video control panel browse to
setup g-sync then select your free sync
monitor from here make sure both the
enabled g-sync g-sync compatible check
box and the enable settings for the
selected display model checkbox are both
ticked the second check box doesn't
appear if the monitor is chasing
certified then all you have to do is
click apply your monitor will restart
and adaptive sync will be enabled in
some cases you might need to go into the
global 3d settings and select G sync
compatible from the monitor technology
drop-down menu but across the monitors
I've tested this wasn't necessary it's
also important to note that free sync
has to be enabled in your monitors on
the screen menu some wonders have a
toggle that allows you to turn free sync
or adaptive sync on or off you'll need
to set it to on to get the option to
enable adaptive sync one final note
about this before we get into the test
results jacent compatible and free sync
monitors only work with invidious Pascal
GPUs or newer I tested a variety of
monitors with an NVIDIA GeForce r-tx
2080 ti but all Pascal cards should also
work this is different to gsync monitors
which work with GPUs back to NVIDIA
GeForce 600 series I believe this is
because Pascal is the first GPU
architecture to support adaptive sync as
well as G sync while older architectures
supported just chasing so far I've
tested seven free sync monitors with an
NVIDIA GPU all of these monitors I've
previously tested and found to work
flawlessly with AMD GPUs so no
flickering blanking or other issues they
pretty much work fine I'd have loved to
test more free sync monitors considering
their over 500 models on the market but
these are all
I have on hand right now still I guess
it's a pretty good sample size the
golfer testing was to see if there were
any differences between adaptive sync
enabled and disabled with an NVIDIA GPU
and if there were any differences
compared to the monitor attached to an
AMD GPU with free sync activated this
included testing the monitor across a
range of refresh rates to see how it
behaved inside and outside the refresh
rate range the first monitor I tested
was the ASIC kg 2 5 1qf a budget 24 inch
1080p monitor with a 30 to 144 Hertz
refresh rate range this is a great
monitor for the price and it's safe to
say I found no issues with the monitor
working with adaptive sync enabled on an
NVIDIA GPU no flickering no banking
nothing it worked exactly the same as
when hooked up to an AMD GPU so that's a
success the second monitor was the BenQ
el2 870 you a 4k 60 hertz panel with a
narrow 40 to 60 hertz refresh rate range
this monitor also worked perfectly
although the refresh range is too narrow
to support low framerate compensation or
LFC so when frame rates dropped below 40
fps adaptive sync no longer functioned
and either tearing or stuttering was
introduced depending on whether you had
vsync disabled or enabled this is
expected behavior though and also
happens with an AMD GPU again outclassed
this as a perfectly working display and
as a success the next monitor was the
vo-tech G in 2040 another 24 inch 1080p
monitor this time with a VA panel and
the 48 to 144 Hertz refresh rate range
again this monitor worked perfectly and
due to the large refresh rate range it
also supported LFC
this was one feature I was curious to
see whether it worked on NVIDIA GPUs or
not if in video was being lazy they
would just let adaptive sync deactivate
when frame rates dropped below the 48
Hertz refresh window however that's not
the case instead Nvidia is properly
supporting LFC with monitors that should
support LFC so when frame rates drop
below 48 fps the monitor runs at a
multiple of the frame rate and frames
are duplicated for example if the game
was running at 37 fps the monitor would
refresh at 74 Hertz and show each frame
twice so it's nice to see one of the key
features of adaptive sync that Nvidia
already uses for juicing kimonos also
works here without any
corners cut I tested two other monitors
with similar results the AOC c-27j one
which is a 27 inch 1080p monitor with a
48 to 144 Hertz refresh range and the
vo-tech GN 32 LD a 32 inch 1440p monitor
with a 48 to 144 hertz refresh range
both monitors also worked perfectly and
had a functional LFC then we have the
Philips momentum 43 a 43 inch 4k monitor
with a 48 to 60 Hertz refresh range and
HDR support there's no LFC here due to
the narrow refresh window but otherwise
this panel worked as expected with no
issues the good news here is that you
get adaptive sync support even when HDR
is enabled it's not a matter of choosing
one or the other
HDR has no impact on adaptive sync
capabilities which is good news for
those interested in an HDR monitor but
didn't want to buy a juicing ultimate
display there is one freesync monitor I
tested that didn't work with adaptive
sync on an NVIDIA GPU but this isn't a
huge surprise the vo-tech NB 24c only
supports adaptive sync through HDMI
while nvidia gpus only support adaptive
sink through DisplayPort AMD GPUs can do
adaptive sink through either HDMI or
DisplayPort so this monitor has
functional adaptive sync with AMD GPUs
but not NVIDIA GPUs the lack of adaptive
sync over HDMI will also disappoint
those looking to pair an NVIDIA GPU with
the range of free sync capable TVs that
have been hitting the market in recent
years most precinct TVs only have HDMI
ports so again NVIDIA GPU owners will be
left out now so of these seven monitors
I tested six worked flawlessly as I
expected the one monitor that didn't
work was never going to work because it
required free sync over HDMI which
Nvidia doesn't support it's also good to
verify that low framerate compensation
and HDR work in conjunction with
adaptive sync on NVIDIA GPUs just like
on AMD GPUs so there's no real
difference between the free sync
implementation on Nvidia and on AMD
graphics cards I expect what I found
here will be the case for the vast
majority of free sync monitors if the
monitor is known to work perfectly with
AMD GPUs / DisplayPort so you know it
doesn't have inherent flickering issues
it should also work perfectly with
NVIDIA GPUs
when you enable the toggle if the
monitor has issues on an NVIDIA GPU it
will also likely have issues on an AMD
GPU and should be returned I guess a
question some people would be asking is
should the monitors I tested to work
perfectly actually be certified as Jason
compatible and it's hard to say with
that knowing Nvidia strict testing
guidelines however any monitor that
doesn't support LFC will automatically
fail in videos testing and there are
loads of precinct monitors with that LFC
including two that I tested today but I
think it's important to stress that you
don't need to purchase adjacent
compatible monitor to get adaptive sync
with your NVIDIA GPU buying a decent
compatible monitor will guarantee your
working experience and guarantee support
for features like AFC but regular free
sync monitors will work just fine as
well at least based on what I've seen
today don't fall for the BS that all the
non certified monitors will have issues
because that's definitely not true as
for a few loose ends I don't have any
monitors that actually qualify as Jason
compatible so I can't tell you how the
experience differs compared to non
certified monitors however I expect the
experience to be exactly the same
considering the experience with
non-certified 4s inka monitors is
already excellent again the decent
compatible badge just ensures a certain
level of quality that you may not get
with say the cheapest and crappiest free
sync displays if you're wondering about
input lag I measured no appreciable
difference to input lag between adaptive
sync enables and disabled on NVIDIA GPUs
enabling adaptive sync does not appear
to increase GPU side processing time
which is also the case for AMD GPUs so
that's good news as well you can use
multiple adaptive sync displays hooked
up to a single NVIDIA GPU you're not
limited to just one adaptive sync enable
display however adaptive sync will only
function on one monitor at a time I
don't expect this to be an issue for
most people but say you have two games
running on two separate adaptive sync
displays only one of those monitors will
be fed and adaptive sync signal from its
corresponding game I also haven't tested
any free sync to monitors because I
don't have any on hand because freezing
2 is an HDR pipeline exclusive to AMD
that allows the game to talk directly to
the monitor for lower latency HDR
processing I don't expect this
functionality to work with NVIDIA GPUs
however this won't stop regular HDR
working in conjunction with adaptive
sync on NVIDIA GPUs as I've already
mentioned so there's an own or a
thinking of buying a precinct to monitor
will get HDR functionality just not
preaching to HDR functionality in a
limited selection of games that support
it finally I think Nvidia supporting
free sync is whilst nothing but a good
thing for the industry and consumers in
general it did take in video quite some
time to do so and I'm not a fan of
Nvidia basically calling all free sync
monitors garbage in the process but this
will bring Cheaper adaptive sync
monitors to owners of the most popular
GPUs on the market I really don't see a
reason anymore to buy a g-sync display
if there's a free sync equivalent and I
guess that's it for this one if you also
have a free sync display and an NVIDIA
GPU I'd love to hear how you're finding
the experience so leave a comment below
I'm also interested to see if there are
many people with displays that do have
issues with adaptive sync enabled
especially if those issues are not
present on AMD GPUs or aren't a known
issue with that particular model as
