can finally show you what the new second
gen rising processes have to offer might
surprise some of you but it's already
been one year since AMD first introduced
their rise in cpu series does that
architecture was a clean sheet frame d
that's fantasy ended up being a huge
success now it's time to unleash these
n+ architecture on the 12 nanometer
process but before we do this video has
been sponsored by Squarespace
whether you need a domain website or
online store make it with Squarespace
for more information please check the
link in the video description today we
have the new Rison 720 700 X and risin
520 600 processors to show you an AMD
tells us that these n+ architecture
offers a reduction in cache latency
anywhere from 13 percent up to 34
percent an 11 percent reduction in DRAM
latency IPC improvements of
approximately three percent and improved
memory support for greater frequencies
so that all sounds good in addition to
all that Global Foundries 1200p process
LP for leading performance means higher
frequencies and improved power
consumption AMD says this new process
offers transistor performance that is 10
to 15 percent better than that of the
previously used process in short we're
seeing a 300 megahertz increase in clock
speed up to four point three gigahertz a
50 millivolt reduction in core voltage
and a possible Olcott overclock of
around 4.2 gigahertz so far AMD's
announced for second gen rising cpus and
for this review we have the X models the
9 X 26 and 2700 now available but only
for biddest testing them in time for
today's release so we've pre-ordered
those models and we'll have a review
online shortly moving on let's just
quickly go over the specs I'll provide a
table and screen with a bit more
information but the things worth noting
is that the 2700 X is an eight-course 16
thread CPU with a 3.7 gigahertz base and
a 4.3 hertz max boost frequency then we
have the 2600 X which is a 6 chord 12
thread CPU that operates 100 megahertz
lower for the bass and boost clocks the
2700 X cost $330 u.s. and the 2600 X
just 230 dollars u.s. so that means the
700x is coming in well under the 1800 x
and 1700 x launch prices and in fact
matches the 1700 for 2600 exits between
the launch price of the 1600 x and a
1600 so AMD looks as though they're
going to continue being extremely
competitive on pricing those are the
highlights and while there are more
things that we could talk about like xf
art or sense mi technology we're going
to skip over that stuff for this video
and just talk about the test methods
used and then jump right into the
results because I know that's what many
of you guys are desperately wanting to
see for testing the new second gen rise
in the CPUs I'm using the asrock x4 70
Taichi ultimate but I've double-checked
all the results with the gigabyte x4 70
or s gaming 7 as well and both
motherboards did work flawlessly the
memory of choice is G skills snipe 4x
ddr4 3400 CL 16 and I've merely loaded
the XMP profile all testing has been
conducted with the Box coolers unless
specified otherwise and this goes for
all the CPUs benchmarked in this video
and for the unlocked Intel K processors
I will be using the corsair h 110 IV to
the first gen rising CPUs which include
the Rison 7 1800 x and verizon 5 1600
have been tested on the asrock x 370
taichi using g skills flare x ddr4 3200
cell 14 memory unfortunately i did run
out of time to add more first generalise
and CPUs to the results but those two
parts will give us a good idea of what
we're looking at in terms of gains for
these second gen rising parts please
note all the data has been updated for
this review so that means it's all fresh
it's been gathered in the past 2 weeks
so I couldn't just simply carry over the
1600 X or 1700 results from previous
tests they need to be retested all
testing has been done with the latest
drivers Windows updates motherboard BIOS
updates game and application updates
throughout the testing we'll be looking
at stock out-of-the-box performance as
well as overclocking the first gen
rising CPUs have been overclocked to 4
gear Hertz while I was able to get the
2600 X stable at 4.1 yoghurts and the
2700 X at 4.2 years
I should note though that getting my
2700 X stable at 4.2 geek Hertz was
quite difficult
hitting 4.2 gigahertz on all calls
wasn't
easy and it did require one point 4
volts to pass our hour-long blender
stress tests for this overclock I am
using the corset h 150 i pro then the
2600 X now that failed our stress test
at 4.2 Hertz and this forces down a 4.1
gigahertz which was a bit disappointing
perhaps though we've got a bad chip time
will tell
also remember nothing is guaranteed with
overclocking
and as I put this video together I don't
actually know if these are good or bad /
clocks a MIDI does suggest though that
the over clocks are now in the range of
four point two units but until we have
more data and just take that with a
grain of salt still the good news is the
2600 X was stable at 4.1 gigahertz using
the Wraiths firebox cooler and I'll
include temperatures at the end of the
video unfortunately though as I said I
did run out of time and therefore wasn't
able to include as many first-generation
CPUs as I would have liked to also I
didn't have time to overclock the sky
like X CPU so this is something I will
do in a future video alright so I think
that's about everything it's time to get
into the benchmarks before we get into
the application and gaming benchmarks
here's a quick look at the memory
bandwidth performance despite using the
slightly faster ddr4 34-hundred memory
the second gen rise and cpus are
comparable to the original parts with a
throughput of around 39 gigabytes per
second overclocked though the memory
bandwidth does remain much the same and
I'll likely explore memory scaling and
all that sort of stuff in greater detail
in a future video here we have the
cinnamon jar 15 results we do see some
really nice gains please note though
that we don't report the absolute best
score but rather an average of 6
back-to-back runs and the 2,700 X did
deliver slightly better results with an
upgraded cooler but the results you're
going to see here first
based on the Box cooler though 2,700 X
improves on the 1800 X's single thread
score by 11 percent though just 8% for
the multi-threaded score but that was
enough to edge out the core i7 78 20x
meanwhile the rosin 520 600 X does look
very impressive when compared to the non
X 1600 and although it only matched the
single thread score of the 7800 X it was
7% faster for the multi-threaded test
overclock the 2,700 X is a base to
producing a multi-threaded score of 1800
and 79 points making it 7% faster on the
maxed out 1800 exit 4 gigahertz it also
beat the 5.2 gigahertz 8700 K by a
convincing 13 percent margin the 2600 X
on the other hand was a little less
impressive only improving on its stock
score by just 4% the horizon 720 700 X
was 10 percent fast in the 1800 X for
the PC mark 10 video editing test and
this placed it roughly on par to 7700 K
and ahead of the 78 20x and 80 600 K the
2600 X managed to match the r7 1800 X
and i7 700 X though it was only slightly
faster than the r5 1600 overclocked the
2700 X was 6% faster in this test while
the 2600 X was just 3% faster already it
is looking like overclocking the rise in
520 600 X is probably going to be a
waste of time horizon 7 2700 X dominated
the PC mark 10 physics benchmark with a
score of twenty thousand nine hundred
and eighty-five points making it once
again 10 percent faster than the 1800 X
this time the 2600 X was 15% faster and
the 1600 which is an impressive game
though of course the margin will be
reduced when compared to these 1600 X
model overclocked both the 2700 X and
2600 X ecat a little extra performance
though in this test it's hardly anything
worth getting excited over for those of
you who love Excel and I personally have
a love/hate relationship with Excel but
my issues aside it is good news for the
new rise and CP users they enable you to
crunch data faster than ever without
breaking the bank
the 2,700 X took just two point two
seconds to complete the workload while
the 2600 X took 2.7 seconds
overclocked the times as expected fell
away and the 2,700 X was able to remain
ahead of the 8700 K if only just again
the 2600 X ran a somewhat boring race it
was well ahead of the overclocked 8600 k
but well behind the 1800 x as expected
SMT is significantly more efficient for
decompression work opposed to
compression this means in our 7-zip
tests while the 2700 X was 12% faster in
the 7820 X when extracting files it was
17% slow when archiving them it's a
similar story when comparing the 2600 X
7800 X overclocked the 2600 X is
slightly faster but again gains are
hardly worth the effort the 2700 X is
more impressive as it enjoyed a 7%
points bump though it was only 5% faster
than the overclocked 1800 X the 2700 X
is slightly sold in the core i7 8700 K
an hour handbrake benchmark and quite a
bit slower than the 78 20x meanwhile the
2600 X was able to match the 8600 K and
it beat the 8400 placing it firmly in
coffee-like core i5 territory
okay so overclock the 2700 X still
trails 8700 K by a reasonable margin
though it was able to beat the 80 600 K
then we see that overclocking the 2600 X
was enough to see it just outpaced the
7700 K at five years so that's a pretty
impressive result moving on to the
corona benchmarks and we see that the
render time for the 2700 X was just a
few seconds longer than the core i7 78
20x which is a solid result for AMD then
we see that the 2600 X did manage to
edge out the 7800 X making for an even
better result the 1800 X already had the
8700 K beat in this benchmark so the
2700 X really just makes sure of it
overclocked to the 8700 K is able to
match the overclocked 1800 X and this
place both on par with this stock 2700 X
however overclocked in the 2700 X
reduced the render time by 10% down in
just 108 seconds
unfortunately the 2600 X was only able
to improve on its time by a 2% margin at
once overclocked moving on to the
blender render test and here the 2700 X
was just 5% fast the 1800s
while the 2600 X beat for 1600 by 15%
Marg and this made these second gen rise
in parts slightly slow in the sky like X
CPUs featuring the same amount of cause
overclocked we again squeeze only
slightly more performance out of these
second gen rise and CPUs the render time
for the 2,700 X was reduced by 7% and 5%
for the 2600 X the v-ray benchmark is
another free standalone application to
help you test how fast your Hardware
renders and of course we are focusing on
the CPU results here you can see that
2700 X basically matches the 7820 X
while the 2600 X was able to match the
7800 X so the second gen
Rison CPUs are very competitive with
Skylar X now on for some overclocking
results once again and we see that the
8700 K at five point two gigahertz can't
actually catch the overclocked 2700 X in
fact it only manages to match the stock
2700 X meanwhile once again we say the
2600 X really is only a fraction faster
once overclocked I really am keen though
to overclock these 7820 X and the 7800 X
and then revisit these tests again
wrapping up the application testing we
have Premiere Pro CC and first up we're
going to check out the encoding
performance here the 2700 X is only able
to beat the export time of the 1800 X by
4% margin and this MANET was still nine
percent slower than the 78 20x the 2600
X while that does do better against the
7800 X but it was still a little bit
slower overclock though we see good
gains from the second gen rise in parts
but again I'll have to revisit these
tests once I've had time to overclock
these skylake excess CPUs we're Rison
has struggled in the past is the lightly
threaded workloads and coding a video
generally sees all caused well utilized
but most editing tasks don't necessarily
use all available CPU resources the
higher clock speeds of the second
generalize and CPUs do really help here
and here we see the 2700 X was able to
reduce this workload time by 7% from the
1800 X as you can see the 2,700 X and
2600 X delivered pretty much the same
result as this isn't a call heavy
workload and we're pretty much just
seeing an advantage of the higher clock
speeds of these new risin parts
overclocked we see a decent performance
uplift but again the 2,700 X and 2,600 X
deliver similar results still you can't
help but notice how much faster the 8700
K is for these sorts of workloads when
compared to the 2,700 X the 8700 K
reduced the completion time by 19% even
at 5 gigahertz you can still expect it
to be around 15% faster alright time to
move on to some games and for those of
you hoping to see vastly improved gaming
performance you're probably going to be
a bit disappointed though there are some
decent results here so just wait until
we get to the hosts for ashes of the
singularity the 2,700 X only matched the
1800 X while the 2600 X was a good bit
faster than the 1600 overclocking did
little for the 2600 X while the 2700
enjoy a decent performance uplift
nothing extreme but it did overtake the
overclocked 7700 K and 8600 K processors
moving on to Assassin's Creed origins
and here we have a few noteworthy things
to discuss firstly we are GPU bound and
even with the GTX 1080 at 1080p
the ultra quality settings are very
demanding still the KB lake and
coffee-like CPUs beat the Rison 7 1800 X
with ease and sadly the 2nd gen CPUs
aren't really much faster than the 1800
X however it is worth knowing they do
still match the sky like experts in this
game and you will see a bit more of this
as we look at other titles basically
this comes down to how the cores are
connected and while extremely efficient
for connecting up to 10 cores Intel's
ring bus method that's used for the KB
Lake and coffee like CPUs and pretty
much all their mainstream our CPUs
doesn't seem to scale that efficiently
beyond say 10 cores and this is where
intel's mesh interconnect will take over
i'll discuss this a little bit more
later in the video but for now let's
check out assassin's creed again with a
lower quality preset dropping down to
the higher quality preset doesn't change
much and we again see very similar
performance trends the 2700 x and 2600 x
deliver basically the same results and
again while on par with the Scarlet x
parts they are quite a bit slower than
the kb lake and coffee-like cpus
overclocking once again doesn't really
help the bottleneck here doesn't appear
to be frequency at the 2nd gen rising
cpus also aren't able to improve on the
performance we saw from the 1800 X which
is disappointing to see moving on the
battlefield 1 and here we see very
similar results between the 2700 X and
2600 X just 2 to 3 FPS separate the two
performance II is very competitive
though the 8700 K completely walks away
with the 1% low result hitting a hundred
and twenty FPS overclocked we say
reasonable gains from the 2700 X but
again it does trail the GPU limited kb
lake and coffee-like cpus in an effort
to remove or at the very least reduce
the GPU bottleneck i've dropped down to
the medium quality preset with
battlefield 1 here we see the 2700 X and
2600 X again deliver very similar
results as battlefield one doesn't
require 16 threads 12 threads will
happily get the job done the 2,700 X
still trailed the 8700 K by an 18
percent margin
and the 8600 k by a 10% margin again
overclocking doesn't really help that
much the 2700 X or the average frame
rate increased by just 5% and that was
enough to match the stock 7700 K
meanwhile the 8700 K was 24% faster next
up we have far cry and again the 2700 X
is only slightly faster than the 2600 X
though it does offer a noteworthy step
forward from the 1800 X the 2700 X was
roughly 10% fast in the 1800 X which
really isn't that bad fact that's
actually quite good overclocking helps
squeeze out a few more frames but the
gains were even better with the cable a
canned coffee like CPUs this means the
87 or okay is now a 21% faster for
example our overwatch bot benchmark is
very CPU intensive but there are a few
problems here and one of them is that we
are artificially GPU limited as the game
has a 300 FPS frame cap that said you'd
expect the average frame rate to be much
closer to the frame cap than it is
before the bots engage one another
though we are locked at 300 FPS but once
they come together the frame rates on
all CPUs drop down closer to 200 fps
I'm not quite sure what this limit is it
could have something to do with the game
engine I haven't used overwatch to test
high-end CPUs for a while now it was
great for comparing two four and six
core CPUs but with today's high-end CPUs
we send you pushing the game to its
limits here we see at the horizon 720
700 X is fast enough to reach the limit
and therefore it's able to roughly match
the Intel CPUs because of this apparent
limit the 2700 X doesn't gain much from
overclocking in this test and the 2600 X
doesn't typically gain much from
overclocking anyway from what we've seen
so again we see that again here
Warhammer vermintide 2 was slow with the
GTX 1080 on all the tested CPUs when
using DirectX 12 so I removed those
results and stuck with DirectX 11
exclusively at Tony P we're hitting the
limits with the GTX 1082 are using the
extreme quality settings and this sees
the 2700 X basically match the IE 700 K
and here at trails the Intel CPUs by 2
to 3 frames per second
overclocking does provide a few extra
frames here and there but because we're
mostly GPU limited the gains are small
wrapping up the game benchmarks we have
vermintide to using the medium quality
settings and here
2700 X wasn't nine percent fast in the
1800 X while the 2600 X was 13% faster
than the 1600 although the 2700 X was
10% slow in the 80s 700 K it was 16%
fast in the 78 20x and that's a very
interesting result overclocked we do see
small gains from the second gen rise in
CPUs and again overclock in the 2600 X
looks to be pretty much a waste of time
and I'll discuss that more when looking
at the power consumption figures which
we'll do now looking at power
consumption when testing with ash of the
singularity we see at the 2700 X only
increases the total system consumption
by four percent when compared to the
2600 X it also only used two percent
more than the 8700 K now the core i7
8720 X looks pretty bad here using
fifteen percent more power than the 2700
X but remember it was 14% faster as well
so performance per watt is actually much
the same in this title overclocking only
increase the power draw of the second
gen rise in CPUs by a small margin six
percent for the 2,700 X for example the
8700 case or total system consumption
increased by 18 percent making it less
efficient once overclocked the 2700 X
and 2600 X will once again consumed a
very similar amount of power this time
when testing with far cry 5 they were
basically on part with the 8700 K but
did use less than the sky like X parts
so in this total a second gen rising
CPUs were much more efficient than these
7820 X and 7800 X overclocking again
didn't have a huge impact on power draw
for the second gen rise and CPUs well it
did see the KB lake and coffee-like CPUs
eat up loads more power for our blender
workload the 2600 X consume roughly the
same amount of power as the 87 okay
while the 2,700 X was on part with these
7800 X overclocked the second gen rise
and CPUs consumed around 20% more power
which is a lot better than the almost
60% increase seeing when overclocked in
the 8700 K interestingly the 2,700 X was
just 6% fast in the 1800 X in handbrake
and yet we see here it does consume 15%
more power in fact the 2600 X matched
the power consumption of the 1800 X
which was very surprising the 2700 X
also push system consumption 9 percent
higher than the 1800 X when we looked at
the encode performance in premiere
Pro and it only reduced the encode time
by four percent interestingly though the
2600 X consumed just 10% more power than
the 1600 but it was able to reduce the
encode time by 16% in terms of
performance per what the second
generation CPUs will comparable to the
skylake x78 20x and 7800 x in this
application using the provided box
cooler I tested out how the horizon 520
600 X got on and with the race Speier
found very reasonable temperatures out
of the box gaming you'd expect
temperatures to hover between 50 and 60
degrees assuming you have a well
ventilated case that is it's well worth
noting though that the fan was very
quiet throughout our testing
overclocking had little impact on
temperatures when gaming however we did
see a massive increase for the heavy
blender workload and after an hour the
CPU did peak at 90 degrees which is
certainly getting up there now the 2700
X gets the fancy new wraith prison
cooler and while more substantial than
the spire temperatures did climb higher
when paired with the eight core CPU out
of the box the prism allowed the 2700 X
2 hits 64 degrees in our game test and
92 degrees if the blender stress test
that being the case the prison couldn't
handle are 4.2 gigahertz overclock and
gaming wasn't too bad but the max
temperature when using the blender
stress tests or thermals reach their
limit and this would often cause crashes
strapping on the corsair h 150 i pro
solved these issues and reduced the
blender load temp down to 81 degrees
which is very reasonable gaming
temperatures also drop down below 6
degrees as well so overclockers will
want to upgrade the cooler and I will
explore more cost-effective options in a
future video while on the subject of
coolers as I said the stock 2700 X
testing was done with the Wraith prism
box cooler and all overclocking was
conducted using the corsair h1 50 I Pro
running our blender stress test the 2700
exhaled a clock speed of 3.8 gigahertz
on all cores and then upgrading to the H
150 I pro increased that frequency to
3.9 gigahertz and this improves the
render time by less than a percent so
not a big deal there but it does suggest
that those overclocking will want to
upgrade the cooler and will explore more
options in a future video before
wrapping up the testing there are a few
more benchmarks I wanted to squeeze in
now
these next few graphs compare the rise
in seven 2700 X and rise in seven 1800 x
o'clock four o'clock at four gigahertz
on these same X 470 motherboard using
the same memory and timings
interestingly whereas we haven't be able
to get the 1800 X working with memory
higher than ddr4 3200 on rx 370 boards
it did work all the way up to ddr4 3600
on the X 470 boards firing up Cinebench
r15 we set the memory frequency has
little impact on this test that said we
do see AMD's claim of an approximate
three percent increase due to IPC gains
is spot on at the same frequency the
2700 X was up to three percent faster
though for the most part we saw gains
around the two percent mark still that's
better than nothing he said as he gazed
over to his coffee like CPU then he's KB
like CPU and then finally he's skylake
cpu interestingly the difference between
g.skill sniper X ddr4 3400 cell 16
and ddr4 3600 sound nineteen memory is
virtually non-existent
the elusive timings of the higher
clocked memory pretty much nullifies any
advantage the higher frequency might
bring although we only saw a two to
three percent improvement with these
Cinebench r15 results here we see the
2700 x shaving seven percent off the
render time of course the improved cache
performance could also be helping here
but it's great to see the second gen
rising CPU offering such a noteworthy
improvement where match clock for clock
finally we have battlefield 1 and here
you can see that AMD has made great
strides the 2700 X was 5 to 6 percent
fast when comparing the 1 percent low
data and 7 percent faster on average
granted those are just single figure
gains but that is going to help rise and
do battle with the coffee like CPUs in
gaming benchmarks as we've already seen
remember we're testing with a GTX 10
atti at 1080 P using medium quality
settings here rising now has a much
better chance of finding the limits of
your graphics card under more realistic
gaming conditions despite the fact that
we're almost 4000 words and well over 50
graphs deep into this review I still
feel like there's much more than I want
to cover here and nevertheless though I
have covered all the essentials for this
review and it should give you a good
idea of how the horizon 720 700 X and
Rison 520 600 X compared to the current
generation Intel CPUs
as was the case with the first
generation parts AMD offers seriously
strong performance in core heavy
productivity workloads stock at
overclocked to the 2700 X beats the 8700
K and most workloads though there are
times where the higher clocked
coffee-like CPU will still pull ahead
it's fair to say they trade blows the
2700 X did have the advantage of
slightly higher clocked memory in these
tests but I have quickly gone back and
checked a few of the benchmarks with the
8700 k using ddr4 3400 memory and the
gains are extremely small sometimes even
non-existent also remember the 3200
memory operates at tighter timings I
also realized that the 8700 K at five
point two years is without question
showing a best-case scenario for Intel
but that's kind of the point in a lot of
the gaming benchmarks we see the 2700 X
clocked at 4.2 gigahertz which I also
feel as a best-case scenario for AMD we
see that the second-generation rise in
CPU does struggle to hang with even
these stock 7700 K the low latency ring
bus really is king for games and this is
going to continue to be a problem for
AMD until intel's forced to use the mesh
in to connect architecture once games
call for significantly more cause but
don't hold your breath on that one I'm
not actually saying that it won't happen
because it absolutely will happen I'm
just saying it might not happen as soon
as I am they are hoping for but let's
hope that's not the case because it
would mean better games for all of us
here's a quick look at some averages
across the games tested at any pair
using various quality settings with the
gtx 980ti
here the 2700 X and 2600 X look very
competitive though we are only seeing a
7% improvement for the 1% low
performance for the 2700 X over the
1,800 X and even less when looking at
the average frame rate still it's well
worth noting that the 2700 X did manage
to edge at these 78 20x and this is a
pretty big deal overclocking the second
gen rise and cpus led to small gains and
the 2700 X was really only able to keep
pace with this stock 7700 K though it
has to be said the 77 ok is a
particularly good gaming CPU for 2700 X
was also only 4% fast in the 80 600 K
and 10% styled nearly 700 K which is a
good result for AMD again in a lot of
these tests we are GPU bound
we're also using a GTX 1082 at 1080p so
it's hardly extreme GPU bottlenecking
power consumption was really all over
the place in some workloads the 2700 X
only used slightly more than the 1800 X
while in others it used quite a bit more
still what's key to note here is that
the second gen rising CPUs were at least
on par with the sky like x-series in
terms of performance per watt and we're
often a little better I should note that
the horizon 5 1600 and rise in 7 1800 X
performed the same on both the be 350 X
370 and X 470 motherboards but memory
support did appear better on the X 470
board this is something I will have to
look into a bit more in a future video I
did also have a few stability problems
with the 2nd gen rising CPUs on the 300
series boards but that could just be
something as simple as a BIOS issue
again I'll have to look into this in a
future video in short I was limited to
ddr4 3066 which does sound a bit odd
surely this is just an issue with the
Azeroth board I used for testing again
as it stands not a lot has changed to
you if you're primarily using your PC
for gaming and you see high frame rates
with a high refresh rate display then
the Intel coffee-like Core i5 and core
i7 processors do offer the best
experience of course you will need to be
happy with upgrading your platform every
few years but I suspect those dumping
loads of money on a core i7 with a top
notch said 370 motherboard with cooling
a match probably our having said that in
a number of modern titles these six and
eight call Verizon CPUs are capable of
delivering a great gaming experience
even on a 144 Hertz display moreover if
you're going to be using a GTX 1080 or
in particular a gtx 1070 or slower then
the difference between those CPUs is
going to be almost impossible to spot in
modern titles then for applications as I
noticed earlier the 2700 X stacks up
very well against the mighty 8700 K and
you can really go either way there
however the 2600 X well that thing
basically crushes the 8600 K and by
extension all coffee like core i5 CPUs
when compared to the 82nd okay you are
looking up to 40% more processing power
out of the box of course I am talking
about core heavy workloads here there
are instances where the 8600 Kade
pull ahead though when it does it is
only by a few percent so as I said
earlier not a lot has changed here
as expected the second generation rise
and CPUs are a little better at
everything when it compared to the first
generation ships and well that's
obviously a good thing I already
preferred the horizon 5 1602 the core i5
8400 I just felt that Rison was a better
all-rounder and now well I prefer the
2600 x2 any of the coffee-like core i5
parts unless as I said earlier you're
doing nothing but gaming on a high
refresh rate monitor with a high-end
graphics card again though as an
all-rounder I feel that the 2600 X is a
better option moving on to the topic of
overclocking when compared to the coffee
like CPUs the second gen rise and CPUs
are a lot less exciting however I think
it has to be said that they are a lot
more practical as well you can overclock
all cores on the 2600 x2 4.1 gigahertz
using the Box cooler meanwhile the 2700
X will also do 4.1 gigahertz using a
basic air cooler I'm not 100% sure what
kind of overclock can go to the Box
cooler this is something I will have to
do a bit more testing on to work out but
the point here is you can expect
reasonable temperatures without having
to spend big bucks on cooling without
resorting to deal inning and mega
cooling the KT 700 K is really only good
for a 5 gigahertz at best so keep that
in mind still it is worth noting that
you will only see a few percent drop in
performance from 5.2 year hurts down to
5 gigahertz helping the second gen rise
and CPUs along other new X 470
motherboards I really wasn't sure what
to expect here I thought that the boards
would just be exactly the same as the X
370 boards but the as rockin gigabyte
boards that I have in hand haven't just
been a rock-solid they've been
absolutely fantastic with higher clock
to memory overall a solid upgrade
package here from AMD and if things
weren't already competitive in the CPU
market they are now and 2018 is shaping
up to be one of the best years in recent
history Verizon got off to a bit of a
rough start you could say this time last
year but I'm happy to report the second
generation CPUs have just gone off
without a hitch and AMD looks as though
they're going to be in great shape this
