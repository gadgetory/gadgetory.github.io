box video I'm not quite sure how to
properly introduce this video because in
a way it's a bit pointless or at least
the testings a bit pointless and I know
that's not a great way to start off but
I found the results interesting and I
thought you guys might as well basically
over the past few weeks in my spare time
something I sadly have very little at
the moment I've been madly benchmarking
CPUs the primary reason for this is to
build up a database of results for when
Caddy Lake and then finally arrive who's
then every time I talk about Zen I get
excited
anyway when benchmarking intel's old
Sandy Ridge processes I noticed
something strange they were much slower
than expected not that long ago I did a
huge amount of testing for a video map
presented which looked at how the last
five generations of intel core i7
processors compared in terms of
performance when gaming with all five
processors clocked at four gigahertz the
Sandy Bridge 2600 K was for the most
part not a great deal slower than the
6700 K at the most extreme when looking
at the minimum frame rate we found the
2600 K to be around 20% slower this is a
reasonably large drop-off in performance
though given the age of the Sandy Bridge
architecture we didn't feel this was
significant moving forward to the here
and now when making a similar comparison
between these processes I found the 2600
K was at times more than 30 percent
slower that's a pretty big difference
compared to what was found around nine
months ago so I wanted to find out what
was going on was I doing something wrong
or was there some other factor at play
the key difference between now and then
other than the games being tested which
no doubt contributes to some of the
performance hit I'm now using a
significantly more powerful GPU
previously testing was done with the
980ti but now I'm testing with the more
updated Titan XP for those wondering the
reason why we use such a fast GPU or at
least the fastest GPU available time of
testing is to remove this component as a
performance limiting factor and this
places more emphasis on CPU performance
so was the combination of new or more
demanding games plus a more powerful GPU
their only reason why Sandy Bridge fell
further behind as it turns out there's
another factor to consider the PCI
Express bus
as many of you know Sandy Bridge
processors support PCI Express 2.0
rather than the current 3.0 revision
this means the link between the PCIe x
16 slot and the cpu is limited to 8
gigabytes per second on the other hand
Ivy Bridge in newer processes offer 16
gigabytes per second as they use the 3.0
revision in the past this hasn't really
been a big deal and we found that with
previous generation gtx 980ti and r9
fury x flagship GPUs that it only cost
gamers around a frame or two at most
although it hadn't been an issue in the
past was the limited PCI Express bound
with an issue for the Titan XP
thankfully there was an easy way to find
out with my asrock Zed 170 motherboard
which allows me to change the PCIe x 16
mode from 3.0 to 2.0 and even 1.0 I
decided to test all three revisions with
the Titan XP as well as the GTX 1080 and
the gtx 1070 graphics cards and yes I
know I know we are such Nvidia shells we
tested with no AMD cards once again but
as I said previously the fury X we've
already know it doesn't benefit from the
latest revision so there isn't much
point testing again and the sames
obviously going to be true for the RX
480 which is slower again and on that
note the GTX 1060 it's not going to
benefit because we know that's around
gtx 980 performance and previously we
didn't see much difference with the 980
TI anyway circling back the reason why i
said the testing was pointless was
because no one is ever going to find
themselves running a gtx 1080 let alone
a titan XP on a platform that doesn't
support the latest pci express revision
i suppose if they did though it would
look something like that
titan XP on a zd68 motherboard with a
2600 k processor yeah I don't think so
either
still I've gathered all the results for
my own investigation to find out what
was going on and I found them
interesting thought you guys might as
well and decided to share them so let's
check them out testing with Gears of War
4 you can see that when using the gtx
1070 there is no difference in
performance between the second and third
generation PCIe revisions in fact
there's almost
difference when looking at the very
first revision either the gtx 1080 also
provides similar performance trends for
the most part moving up to the titan XP
things start to change here we see a 5
FPS jump in the minimum frame rate
though this does only equate to a 5%
increase but honestly that's larger than
I was expecting the day use X mankind
divider results are very interesting the
gtx 1070 only sees a 1 to 2 FPS increase
when upgrading from the second gen PCIe
revision that said we do see a steady 3
FPS increase when coming from the first
gen revision increasing the rendering
power the gtx 1080 we find similar
performance margins for the most part
the same is true for the Titan XP
results the margin widens by just a
single frame the last game where around
our full battery tests was battlefield
one here the Titan XPS are a 4% increase
for the minimum frame rate and a 6%
increase for the average we're moving to
the latest third generation revision
that netted us eight FPS more on average
not a game changer but it will make a
difference for those running 144 Hertz
monitors ok so the gains with the Titan
XP weren't earth-shattering but we did
see a three to five percent performance
to climb when using the second
generation PCI Express revision this
goes some way to explaining the extra 10
percent Sandy Bridge losses to skylake
in my recent tests the rest we put down
to the Titan XP being much fast in the
gtx 980ti and the fact that we're using
more modern demanding no more modern
games that are more demanding yeah more
modern more demanding games I'm sure
these results in below anyone's socks
off but as I said I found them
interesting and thought you guys might
too there's not much else to say really
you aren't going to run into any
real-world scenario where a Titan XP is
limited to pcie 2.0 or worse but now you
know how to perform if it was on that
bombshell I'm your host Steve catch you
next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
