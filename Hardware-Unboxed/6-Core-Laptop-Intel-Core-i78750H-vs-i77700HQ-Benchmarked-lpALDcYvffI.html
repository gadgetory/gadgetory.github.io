we're looking at one of Intel's brand
new six core laptop CPUs that were
officially unveiled yesterday the CPU in
question is the core i7 8750 h and it's
one of seven new coffee-like
H series processors designed for
performance notebooks workstations and
gaming laptops the core i7 8750 H is
essentially the successor to the widely
popular KB like Core i7
7700 HQ that was used in nearly every
gaming laptop to hit the market in the
last year or so I expect the AI 78750 H
will also be the go-to chip for gaming
laptops and other performance mobile
devices so this review will be pretty
useful to anyone looking to upgrade to
one of these new coffee-like
H series systems the key improvement to
the AI 78750 H is in its core count
we're now looking at six cores and
twelve threads up from four cores and
eight threads in the i7 7700 HQ while
keeping to the same 45 watt TDP to fit
these extra cores in the same TDP Intel
has gone with the same approach they
used with the KB leg refresh you serious
serious we've already looked at the base
clock speed has been reduced from 2.8
gigahertz in the 7700 HQ to just 2.2
gigahertz with the 8750 h however while
the base clock has been reduced intel is
pushing a single core performance higher
with these new 8th gen processes the
8750 h hits a maximum of 4 point 2
gigahertz on a single core up from 3.8
gigahertz on the 7700 HQ it's also
capable of the same 4.2 gigahertz clock
speed on to course along with 4
gigahertz on up to 4 cores and 3.9
gigahertz on up to 6 cause that's a
pretty big jump in clock speed
considering the 7700 HQ topped out at
just 3 point 4 gigahertz in all core
workloads you also see nine megabytes of
l3 cache in the 8750 H and it's been
manufactured using Intel's of 14
nanometer plus plus process
which is the same as desktop coffee lake
paths and joining the eye 78758 in the
lineup is another six score 12 thread
core i7 the i7 8850 h which features
increased bass and boost clock speeds
the core i5 line with the 8400 H and
8300 H remain for core 8 thread parts
well at the top we have the unlocked
kora 989 50 HK the coffee-like
H series is completed with two Zealand
chips for mobile workstations those
wanting to buy a gaming laptop won't see
these chips inside their systems but
they are technically part of the new
coffee-like lineup and there will be
great options for performance
productivity oriented devices hopefully
we'll be able to get our hands on
devices with the full range of
coffee-like
H CPUs inside in the next couple of
months but for now we're just testing
the core i7
8750 H our test system is the new
gigabyte Aero 15 which I'll be reviewing
in the next week or so fully but for now
is our test platform for checking out
the first six core laptop CPUs aside
from the eye 78750 H inside this laptop
also packs an nvidia geforce gtx 1070
max-q GPU 16 gigabytes of ddr4 2666
memory a 512 gig PCIe SSD and a 1080p
144 hertz display and a quick note here
before people inevitably talk about this
in the comments yes
testing laptop hardware can be a bit
tricky especially in an apples-to-apples
way because we can't just swap out
components like the CPU and GPU to
remove bottlenecks when necessary but
throughout the benchmarks ahead we will
be focusing on the closest possible
comparisons we can make with the test
systems that we have used of course as
the aro 15 only has a gtx 1070 max-q
inside in some GPU and gaming tests we
will be GPU limited however this does
present the most real-world results as
the vast majority of laptops to use this
cpu will have a discrete GPU no faster
than a gtx 1070 yeah you can get faster
GPUs like the GTX 1018 laptops but
they're expensive and typically not the
most popular options and I did make one
Hardware changed
area 15 for this CPU review and that was
to swap the memory configuration from
single to chilled channel these laptop
chips with a single 16 gigabyte stick
inside but as most other laptops in our
charts use dual channel memory I swap
the single 16 gigabyte stick for to 8
gig sticks at the same speeds that's all
the riveting backstory and information
you need let's get on with some
beautiful blue benchmark charts starting
with the productivity tests they're
moving into gaming later in the video
starting with Cinebench and it's good
news for the eye 78750 H as it
obliterates the 7700 HQ to the tune of
58 percent in the multi-threaded test
when you add in 50% more cores and
increase the clock speeds of these cause
this is the sort of result you can
expect in a best-case scenario the 8750
H also provides 9 percent more
performance in the single third test
which is just shy of the 11 percent
single core turbo clock speed increase
gains in performance of around 50
percent are typical for a lot of
workloads while performing a to pass
x264 encode the 8750 h was 46 percent
faster than the 7700 HQ which is a
significant difference for a rendering
test you won't get quite the same
performance uplift when rendering x265
videos in handbrake but we still
achieved a 34 percent performance gain
here with the 8750 H which is
significant in the Excel Monte Carlo
workload the 8750 H was almost exactly
50 percent faster than the 7700 HQ which
is another strong result for the six
core CPU that will please those that
work with large calculation heavy
spreadsheets compression and
decompression is a huge win for the 8750
H in 7-zip d ID 750 H is 55 percent
faster than the 7700 HQ in compression
and a huge 69 percent fast in
decompression it's a similar result in
WinRAR where the 8750 h was 53% faster
in its compression heavy benchmark daily
750 H even outperformed the 7700 HQ in
WinRAR Singles run a test to the tune of
15% moving on to our Adobe benchmarks
which utilized both the CPU and GPU
with premiere in this test the 8750 h
was 25% faster at rendering your video
with lumetri effects than the 7700 HQ
when using a laptop with the same GPU
inside you won't see a significant
performance advantage in Photoshop at
least while performing an iris blur with
the 8750 edge only performing around 9%
faster not a terrible result but it's
not as strong as many of the other
benchmarks we've shown so far the only
benchmark that showed effectively no
performance difference is MATLAB as a
largely single threaded test that favors
high memory bandwidth the lack of
improvements to the memory controller
could have limited any performance gains
in this workload most PC mark tests are
single threaded so it's no surprise to
see single-digit performance gains in
this workload in the older PC Mark 8
home test the 8750 H was 8 percent
faster than the 7700 HQ in a system with
the same GPU that narrowed to 6 percent
in the creative workload though it did
grow to 12 percent in the werk test and
9 percent in a newer PC market n if
you're interested in memory bandwidth
there is no real difference between the
8750 H and the 7700 HQ both support up
to ddr4 2666 and with the dual channel
configuration you'll get around 25
gigabytes per second of bandwidth cache
performance however is significantly
improved across the board the final test
I'll mention before moving to the gaming
benchmarks is 3d marks times pi tests
while the overall score is just 11
percent higher than a system with the
7700 HQ and an equivalent GPU the cpu
score is a good 52 percent high as
expected which helps to provide most of
the overall score improvement and if
you're wondering about the integrated
GPU it still uses the same UHD 630 as
the previous 7700 HQ so the general
consensus is the eye 78750 H provides a
significant performance increase over
the i7 7700 HQ for productivity
workloads particularly those that are
multi-threaded and can make good use of
the extra to cause but what about gaming
especially on a typical gaming laptop
that is limited in both CPU and cheap
your power let's kick things off with
one of the most CPU limited games we
test with civilization 6 here the 8750 H
provides a decent 29% performance uplift
when looking at average frame rates
compared to the 7700 HQ in an MSI laptop
with the same GPU and memory
configuration however 1% lowers don't
benefit at all from the extra CPU power
so the experience of the game on the
newer 8th gen CPU isn't necessarily
superior assassin's creed origins is
another game that likes a fast CPU and
here we're seeing a 12% gain in favor of
the a 750 H when looking at average
frame rates using the ultra preset at
1080p which extends to 30% in 1% low
performance when we're talking about our
difference between the 36 and 47 fps in
that crucial 1% low figure having that
extra CPU power is certainly pretty
handy I also tested with the medium
preset at 1080p and that margin isn't as
large in favor of the 87 50 H at 11% in
average frame rates and 24% in 1% lows
at least in this game it appears both
quality presets have some CPU
limitations watchdogs to another Ubisoft
title famously punishes the CPU here
we're looking at an 8% performance gain
in favor of the 87 50 H compared to the
7700 HQ in average frame rates which
grows slightly to 11% we're looking at
1% lows this is using the ultra preset
so if you want to turn the settings down
to the medium preset the margin goes to
a 12% on average and 16% in 1% lows
surprisingly Mass Effect Andromeda
benefits a fair bit from the faster 8750
H using the ultra quality preset at
1080p the game is 17 percent faster on
average with the 6 core CPU and 27
percent faster looking at the 1% lower
results in some games the quality preset
you opt for will determine whether you
benefit from the extra CPU horsepower at
least with the gtx 1070 max q if you
love the ultra preset
you'll only see up to an 11 percent
performance improvement in rise of the
Tomb Raider for example but if you
switch to high at 10
expects 16 percent better 1% lows
several other games at fairly typical
quality level showed single-digit or
even zero performance improvements with
the 8750 H Grand Theft Auto 5 for
example performed within the margin of
error of a 7700 HQ system using high
settings and that's with an average
frame rate that exceeded a hundred fps
prey which produces a 1% low figure
above 60fps using the very high preset
also showed no performance gains with
the AE 750 H Hitman which can be CPU
limited at times surprisingly showed no
difference to 1% low performance with
the 87 50 H when playing at ultra detail
settings Middle Earth shadow of war was
around 6% faster with the 87 58
regardless of whether you played using
the ultra or high preset the latter of
which provides a 1% low above 60 FPS so
with a fairly typical if not upper end
discrete laptop GPU the eye 78750 H
doesn't produce as much of a performance
game in gaming as with the productivity
workloads in a best-case scenario unless
you're using unreasonably low settings
for the GPU in your device you can get
up to a 30% performance gain in 1% lows
now this is far from an insignificant
result in fact a 30% getting to these
crucial 1 % low figure will produce a
noticeably smoother and better
experience however the extent to which
you'll get a performance uplift depends
on the game and the settings you use on
the vast majority of gaming laptops
you'll be GPU bottleneck in modern
titles even at modest quality levels at
1080p with a 10 70 max Q inside our test
system performance gains in the 5 to 15%
range of most common even in titles that
already averaged in 80 to 100 FPS range
on a 7700 HQ equipped system again the
lower you push quality levels the more
CPU bottlenecked you'll become but for a
lot of gamers targeting a 60fps 1% low
figure and maybe say a hundred FPS
average using a medium to high preset
the extra CPU power of the 8750 H is
only going to make a modest difference
relative to the 7700
in laptops with the most popular
discrete cheaper use and if you're more
of an ultra quality gamer targeting 40
to 60 FPS the benefits are even less the
real benefit to the ice of an 80 750 H
and having six cores in a laptop form
factor productivity workloads
performance gains around the 50 percent
mark are typical for the 80 758 relative
to the 7700 HQ in multi-threaded
workloads with gains as high as 69
percent in decompression single funded
performance is also up producing gains
just shy of 10 percent but if you're
mostly interested in this CPU for gaming
the eye 78758 isn't going to
revolutionize your experience in systems
with the same GPU the 8750 H only
provides a modest improvement over the
last few Intel H Series generations as
most gaming laptops are still GPU
bottleneck to a varying extent there are
performance gains to be had in some
situations but if you're in the market
for a new gaming laptop your focus
should still be on the GPU of course
where it makes sense you should always
buy a system with the latest generation
of CPUs inside but if you do find a good
deal on a gaming laptop with a last gen
i7 7700 HQ in it you could only be
sacrificing a small amount of
performance for a decent price saving
the one caveat I'll make to that is for
those buying laptops with the gtx 1080
or faster the cpu will have more of an
influence on gaming performance at 1080p
with that level of GPU so keep that in
mind most gaming laptops being GPU
bottleneck in typical conditions
shouldn't take away from what is still a
great CPU from Intel and a significant
step forward in a 45 watt power envelope
like with the 15 watt u series parts
that hit the market last year these new
8 Series parts provide a significant
performance improvement that should
entice anyone who needs high levels of
CPU performance on the go whether you
have a 3rd gen laptop from years back or
a 7th gen laptop from just last year
there are plenty of reasons to upgrade
to a new machine with an 8th gen part
inside like the eye 78758 particularly
if your primary focus is productivity
apps expect to see a lot of laptops with
coffee like CPUs inside hit the market
this month so you'll certainly have
plenty
choices for upgrading over the next
couple of months we'll hopefully get our
hands on more coffee later laptops not
just to check out the rest of the CPU
line but also to see what sort of impact
these new CPUs have on gaming laptops
with different discrete GPUs but that's
it for this one though
big thanks to gigabyte for providing us
with the era of 15x4 our first test of
these coffee-like CPUs definitely check
