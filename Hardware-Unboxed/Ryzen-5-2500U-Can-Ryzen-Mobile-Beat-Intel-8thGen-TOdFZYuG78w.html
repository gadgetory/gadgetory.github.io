unbox today I'm finally covering
something a lot of you guys have been
asking about and that's rising mobile
yep
I have finally managed to get my hands
on one of the only rising mobile laptops
in the wilds the HP Envy x-360 - look at
how AMD's latest mobile silicon performs
of course this isn't the first time
we're seeing AMD APU Zin laptops even
today you can buy a low-end notebook
with the Stoney Ridge APU inside
complete with all the wonders of an
excavator based CPU it's at the high end
that AMD has been absent for generations
mostly because of their slow and
inefficient CPU architecture which
allowed Intel to command that mobile
throne for years now with Rison and the
Zen architecture everything has changed
for AMD not only are their desktop parts
very competitive against the latest from
Intel but it's also allowed Amy to
re-enter the mobile space with the set
of AP use actually up for a fight thanks
to these products codenamed Raven Ridge
we might actually see some competition
back in the ultra thin laptop market the
two AP use in the risin line up for now
are the risin 5 2500 you and the risin 7
2700 you both pack 4 core 8 threads CP
used the same as the latest 8th gen
laptop CPUs from Intel along with ddr4
2,400 memory controllers as you can see
in the table clock speeds range from 2.0
or 2.2 gigahertz base up to 3.6 or 3.8
gigahertz boost right in the ballpark of
KB Lake refresh the big thing to note
here isn't the CPU though which
admittedly is a lot faster than anything
ambi has produced in the mobile space
for years in fact it's the GPU where amy
has a huge competitive advantage over
Intel the Rison 5 2500 you were looking
at today has a Vega
8 GPU with a to compute cores and a
total of 512 shaders clocked up to 1100
megahertz
this GPU is easily twice as fast
from a pure compute perspective compared
to Intel's you HD graphics 620 currently
used in 8th gen parts
it looks faster than RS + graphics on
paper as well though Intel hasn't even
begun rolling out those GPUs in
quad-core ultra portable SKUs so the
rise in the 7 2700 you is even faster
with more compute cores at a higher
clock but I have to hunt down a product
with Rison 7 inside to get a better idea
at how it performs here we'll be
focusing just on the risin 5 2500 you
the impressive aspect to the new rise in
mobile parts is they crammed both that
quad core rise and CPU and a powerful
Vega GP into a 15 watt TDP that's the
very same Teddy P as Intel's equivalent
8th gen CPUs but with the potential for
extra performance pretty much sounds
like a winner right before I get into
some juicy benchmark data I did want to
talk about the test procedure because
testing with a laptop CPU apu is
different and more challenging than
testing a desktop component that's
because laptops come as entire systems
so you know it's hard to lock down
variables and directly compare apples to
apples aspects like the cooling solution
which impacts throttling storage memory
software clock speed tweaks and battery
life all vary between devices and with
very few rising laptops on the market
right now we're pretty much relying just
on data from one laptop and that might
be for a while the good news though is
that the HP Envy x-360 does provide a
good test platform with comparable
hardware to many ultra portables my
review net has 16 gigabytes of ddr4 2400
in a dual channel configuration post a
fast 256 gig PCIe SSD which is great for
reducing bottlenecks in those areas
power consumption and battery life is
harder to test and I'll comment on that
a bit later but for now let's get on to
it the benchmarks the first couple of
benchmarks for PC mark I'm gonna breeze
through as this test does stress a lot
of different system components nor
always just the CPU and GPU however I
have included here to see how a rising
laptop stacks up against some of its
competitors in a brief sort of fashion
the workload the risin 5 2500 you either
sits between the core i7 8550 you and
the core i7 7500 you or it's in the mix
amongst Intel's 7th gen cable ACP use
Intel's 8th gen CPUs were routinely 10
to 20 percent faster in these tests
which is an interesting result but we'll
have to look at some more tests before
we conclude anything so Cinebench is one
of the strongest results for the risin 5
2500 you in the multi-threaded test the
cpu is just slightly slower than the
core i7 8550 you and let's not forget
that the I 78550 you is a higher tier
product than the risin 5 2500 you the
risin 7 2700 you is clocked 5 to 10
percent higher and no doubt would beat
the I 78550 you in this test if you've
been following rise in desktop coverage
the single turn result won't surprise
you though the I 78550 you is a good 17
percent faster here interestingly on a
clock for clock basis the 8550 you is
clocked 11% higher here in single core
workloads so read into that 17% in gap
what you want
encoding x264 videos is a tougher task
for the risin 5 2500 you in the first
pass the 8550 you is a huge 38% faster
though strangely this margin is narrowed
significantly in the second passed to
just 3% and it gets even tougher in x265
encoding where intel's eighth generation
parts hold a commanding lead the 8550 is
a good 23% faster in this workload
encoding the hour-long test video in an
hour and a half compared to two hours
for a risin Microsoft Excel is a short
workload that favors high boost clocks
here Rison is also slower than kb lake
refresh to the tune of 27% again this
isn't a hugely surprising result
considering the f-550 you holds a clock
speakit advantage and intel's kb lake
architecture also has higher IPC as we
showed in our coverage of desktop risin
MATLAB but this is an interesting one
because it's one of the worst results
horizon in fact it's
so bad I'm not quite sure what the
reason for this performance Delta is the
risin 5 2500 you is around twice as slow
as the I 78550 you slower than the very
slow skylake core m3 CPU in our charts
some of the MATLAB workloads in our
benchmark fare worse than others the FFT
and oder ye are much more competitive
but still it's not a great overall
result and it leaves me just a little
bit puzzled in winrar compressions
multi-threaded workload again the intel
core i7
8550 you have performed strongly posting
a 52% lead here though this does vary by
device single certain results oddly
enough here are a bit better for isin
reducing to a 27 percent margin I also
wanted to show memory bandwidth here as
the Rison 5 2500 use supports ddr4 2400
and pushes higher bandwidth in the KB
like our core i7 8550 you at least in
the machines i've been testing with so
far clearly we are not memory bandwidth
limited in the benchmarks I've just been
showing though because risin 5 is still
behind in a number of situations
so while AMD lists the maximum boost
clock of the horizon 5 2500 you as 3.6
gigahertz the CPU does not hit this
clock speed under sustained workloads to
keep within the TDP which is you know a
common behavior on these limited mobile
platforms with the core i7 8550 you we
saw sustained clock speeds during
Cinebench in the 2.6 to 2.7 gigahertz
range on all caused despite a maximum
all core turbo frequency of 3.7
gigahertz with a single thread though
the 8550 you did hit that 3.7 gigahertz
maximum boost frequency in a sustained
workload it's a similar story with the
risin 5 2500 you in fact this apu varies
on a per core basis more frequently than
kb lake are however I did see consistent
performers around 2.7 to 3.0 gigahertz
on all four cores while only on a single
core the 2500 u has no problem hitting
that 3.6 gigahertz maximum boost clock
consistently this does give the 2500 you
Hach speed advantage in multi-threaded
workloads and a small disadvantage in
single call loads so we've seen how the
CPU performs let's move on to the big
story of regarding the risin 5 2500 you
the GPU the Vega 8 GPU inside this chip
is a beast compared to the UHD 620
graphics in KB Lake refresh boasting
around 2.5 times the raw compute power
when you consider this APU features the
same 15 watt TDP this is an impressive
feat from the AMD team it goes to show
how well their graphics architecture
scales down I'll get to actual gaming in
a moment but I first wanted to take a
look at 3d mark I'm jumping right in the
deep end here by looking at times by the
most intensive 3d mark workload that's
clearly way too intensive to run sense
of weight on a laptop however it does
give some interesting insights
particularly as this test is entirely
GPU limited here the Rison 5 2500 you is
just over twice as fast as the Kois of
an 85 50 when viewing the overall score
and this improves to a 2.1 times lead in
the graphics core what this shows is
that in a very intensive GPU workload
Rison has more than a 2x lead in the
same power envelope horizon 5 2500 you
also has a 2.2 X lead in firestrike
though as we move down to the less
intensive workloads rise ins lead starts
to slip in the overall score as the
tests become heavier on the CPU in
skydiver we see a 1.8 to X lead for
risin and in cloud gate just drops to
1.3 3x
let's not forget here that we are
comparing risin 5 to a core i7 either
the risin 7 2700 uses a Vega 10 GPU with
640 shaders compared to 5 12 in risin 5
with the clock speed boost as well so
when comparing risin 7 to core i7 we
will see AMD's apu pull ahead but again
we'll have to wait to actually get my
hands on rising server in a test set out
for proper obviously a lot of you will
be interested in whether the extra GPU
power rise in Mobile provides it's
enough for actual gaming on these ultra
portables I'll have a full X
operation of rising mobile gaming coming
up a bit later but I have tested a small
handful of games on the envy x-360 to
see what is playable so ultra portables
tend to be fairly slow so I usually
start by testing very old games that old
but you know from around 2013 for
several years these sorts of machines
couldn't even hit 60fps in Tomb Raider a
game from 2013 at 720p with the lowest
possible settings these days though the
core i7 8550 hits 93 FPS at these
settings but it's the rise in 525
hundred-year that pulls ahead by 26% you
can quite easily play this game at 1080p
with some higher detail settings if
you'd like though the other interesting
title to mention here is Metro last
light at 1080p medium settings this game
is still utterly unplayable on the eye
78550 you pushing an average of 17 FPS
on the horizon 525 hundred you though
this improves to a 33 FPS average and
this is a pretty intensive title so it's
an impressive result and that's four
percentage gains the horizon 5 2500 u is
94% faster which is a huge result in
favour of AMD I was most excited though
to check out the performance of
civilization 6 not just because it's a
more recent game but also because it's
very GPU and CPU intensive on laptops as
Ryerson has such a low TDP there's a
fine balancing act between giving power
to the CPU and GPU when both are hit
hard
as a result neither part can run at its
maximum power
however with civilization 6 we can see
that although the Rison 5 2500 u is
limited by its 15 watt TDP it manages to
squeeze out a ton more performance than
the core i7
8550 you in fact this game goes from
largely unplayable to completely
playable with rosen mobile thanks to an
87% performance game and at the same
time the game has a faster turn rate
with Rison and this is you know provides
a much better experience with this apu
is civilization 6 alone not intensive
enough for you or how about running
Metro last light and Cinebench
multi-threaded at the very same time in
this test which pushed the GPU and CPU
at full 100% utilization
the risin 5 2,500 you achieved a score
of 304 in Cinebench while pushing 26.2
FPS in Metro last light the coif 78550
you hit 248 in Cinebench and 14.8 fps in
Metro last light that gives the 2500 you
an advantage in both realms 22.6% in cpu
performance and 77% in GPU performance
when both are being taxed simultaneously
give each of these tasks equal weighting
and the risin 5 2500 you squeeze is 45%
more juice from the very same TDP which
is an incredibly impressive result for a
risin mobile the final game I took a
brief look at is Grand Theft Auto 5 with
the risin 5 2500 you can actually play
this game at 1080p with the lowest
detail settings complete with a 1% low
of above 30fps this isn't possible at
all on the i7a 550 you where the game
runs under 30 FPS on average so all the
benchmarks are now out of the way so
let's talk a bit more about how the
Rison 5 2500 year performs generally in
terms of CPU performance the 2500 new is
slower than the core i7
8550 you on average not a perfect apples
to apples comparison I'll admit but the
eye 78552 is 30.6% faster in the
benchmarks were used on average skewed
in favor of Intel a bit by the enormous
disparity in MATLAB now the core i7 CPU
here is a higher tier model but the
equivalent rise in the 720 700 use only
10% faster on paper at best so it's not
going to be enough to close the gap here
for those following the desktop battle
between ambient until these results
shouldn't be a surprise Intel still
holds a strong IPC lead over AMD with
their current products and AMD does not
have a core count advantage in their
mobile parts like they do on the desktop
even with clock speeds favoring AMD by
up to 300 megahertz in sustained all
core workloads at least in in some cases
until strong kami like IPCC's it
outperform rise in mobile across the
board this leaves the core i7
8550 you anyway
from 10 to 25% faster than the risin 5
2500 you in general when a hitting all
four course and typically that margin
will increase in single threaded loads
as Intel gains a clock speed ascendancy
but you know that's not always the case
is this a bad result for Amy's rise in
mobile CPU well not really as we are
comparing core i7 to risin 5 here as I
haven't yet tested any 8th gen Core i5
parts the gap will close a bit when
pitting the core i7 up against the risin
720 700 you or when comparing a core i5
horizon 5 and while it's unlikely that
AMD will take the lead in either
comparison the battle should end up only
10 to 20 percent in favor of Intel and
that's a great result considering amy
has basically come from nowhere in the
high-end mobile space it's also worth
mentioning that most people will be
upgrading to a rise in mobile CPU from
an older dual-core Intel CPU which the
Rison 5 2500 trounces with its 4 core
power gains of around 50 to 80% relative
to the i7 7500 you are common and that's
only pitting Rison 5 up against last gen
Intel silicon coming from a 4-year old
laptop this CPU will blow you away
but the real story here is graphics
performance which is where the Rison 5
2500 you demolishes the core i7
8550 you the vega 8 GPU inside is
considerably more powerful to the tune
of more than 2x in extremely GPU heavy
benchmarks it manages to achieve this
while keeping to the same 15 watt TDP as
KB Lake refresh and even when both the
GPU and CPU is slammed the Rison 5 2500
you pulls ahead by a huge margin on
paper the Reg 8 GPU is about 2.5 X
faster than the new HD 620 in terms of
raw computer though in practical gaming
scenarios I saw anywhere from seventy to
a hundred percent more performance out
of it this is enough to make some games
playable where they were not previously
like a civilization 6 even at admittedly
low settings as I've only had time with
the HP Envy x-360 it's hard to make a
definitive conclusion on how power
efficient the Rison 520
five hundred you is I had started the
process of battery testing the envy
x-360 and results seemed as expected for
this sort of laptop which is good news
for rise in mobile but I do need some
more data before it becomes clear
whether AMD or Intel has a power lead
here
the main issue with rising mobile for
now is availability this testing has
shown in the risin five twenty five
hundred you is a highly competitive apu
and will be especially attractive for
those that want more GPU power in an
ultra portable form factor but you just
don't have many options if you want a
laptop with rising inside there's the HP
Envy x-360 and that's basically it at
the moment and to make matters worse the
envy x-360 is a 15-inch laptop which is
a form factor where invidious MX 150
discrete GPUs are readily available
alongside kb lake cpus in similar
ultra-thin designs
if rising mobile is to succeed mb needs
to get this chip inside 13-inch ultra
portables where discrete GPUs are rarely
seen if the risin 5 2500 you can hit the
same levels of performance in a 13-inch
chassis AMD would have a serious winner
on its hands but right now there are no
options and we can't test that sort of
thing just yet so as we come to the end
of this video my final message to AMD
and laptop manufacturers is get this
chip in laptops judging by the chatter
around Internet there is genuine demand
for ultra portables with an APU like
this inside anyway I will have some more
content on the rise and 520 500 you and
the HP Envy x-360 coming up in the next
few weeks so I guess it's back to
testing for now but until then I'll
catch you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
