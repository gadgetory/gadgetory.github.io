my second time around filming this
introduction once I finished editing and
putting this whole video together I was
quite shocked at the mammoth that it
turned out to be so if you're after a
quick five minute video or something
that just summarizes things really
quickly this video isn't going to be for
you we sort of cover everything or
everything that was humanly possible in
the last week I did multiple not even 16
hour days thing there were 18 hour days
but anyway it doesn't matter it's a big
long video so you've been warned I'll
add a video index somewhere on the
screen I'm not sure where we haven't
done that before but I'll do that and
also pin one down in the comment section
below so you can jump to bits go over
things again if you really want to and
yeah but anyway you've been warned let's
get on with it for those of you who
missed the unboxing we have the thread
Ripper 2990 WX I'm going to say that a
hell of a lot in this video so also be
warned about that and the 2950 x also be
saying that a lot but not quite as much
so I've got those two on hand for
testing and these two CPUs are very
different and they do share the same DNA
but they are quite different we'll go
over that in a moment they also target
different segments of the market and
really probably deserve their own
reviews but for the sake of time the
time we had available I've just lumped
them together into this one big fat
review but they'll no doubt get their
own individual analysis over the coming
weeks so as we learn new things we'll
put that into sort of maybe a two
separate mini reviews a week or two in
the future the second gen interpreter
CPUs were announced earlier this year
during Computex and since then
everyone's attention has been focused
firmly on the 32 or 64 thread part now
knows the 2990 WX coming in at $1,800 us
there will be two models in WX series
and for those wondering the W signifies
that this is a work station series and
the X while the usual extreme nonsense I
suppose along with the 2990 WX there
will also be a 24 core 48 thread model
known as the 2970 WX though that model
won't be available till October but we
do have some simulator results in this
video that we can go over
although the 2990 WX has been receive
the attention the 2950 X is the real
hero of the lineup and basically what we
have here is a refined 1950 X at a $100
US lower launch price as was the case
with the second gen rise in five M rise
in seven models these new thread
ramparts feature reduced cache and DRAM
latency with support for slightly faster
memory so they're based on these n+
architecture which uses the 12 PL
protests from Global Foundries the 2950
X features the same layout as the 1950 X
and this means it comprises of two
active Zeppelin dies each packing out
calls to memory channels and 32 PCIe
gen3 lanes when using ddr4 30 20 memory
the Infinity fabric throughput between
these dies is roughly 50 gigabits per
second as was the case with the 1950 X
the 29 50 X can be configured in one of
two ways using uma uniform memory access
which aimed he refers to as distributed
mode in their rise and master software
under this mode the processor acts as a
single unit and this means threads and
DRAM transactions are distributed evenly
across the entire chip to maximize
bandwidth but in turn this does increase
latency which isn't ideal for things
such as gaming therefore it is possible
to enable Numa or non-uniform memory
access which aimed II refers to as local
mode in the rise and Master software
they call this a local operating mode as
the processor is separated into two
domains and attempts to pair active
cores with local DRAM rather than
accessing memory via controller in a
separate die which comes with a rather
hefty latency penalty the 29:19 WX on
the other hand is a very different beast
it consists of not to Zeppelin dies but
rather for enabling up to 32 cause
however on the X 399 platform aimed II
has imposed some limitations to avoid
cannibalizing their single socket epoch
CPUs the biggest of these limitations
being that there are still just four
memory controllers although there are
two more Zeppelin dies AMD calls these
compute dies
basically what that means is they have
no local PCIe or DRAM access for that
they must travel through the Infinity
fabric to the i/o dives so they would be
the Zeppelin dies with direct access
to PCIe and ddr4 memory as there are
twice as many dies in this configuration
the inferior fabric is also hard so the
throughput between dies is just 25
gigabits per second assuming you are
using ddr4 3200 memory because of this
design which sees 2 dies without direct
access to DRAM it means that unlike the
2150 X the 2990 WX uses numerous
cluesive Lea AMD says this quad Numa
configuration has allowed them to create
the world's first 32 core consumer
processor and just as importantly it has
allowed them to do it while maintaining
backwards compatibility with existing
tr4 products there is however a fairly
obvious drawback that's had me a bit
concerned since we first heard about
this 32 core model we always knew that
the first gen third Ripper CPUs had the
potential to offer up to 32 cores so
this isn't some kind of radical
breakthrough for AMD with their 2nd gen
series the original thread ripper chips
did in fact have 4 dies though two of
them referred to as dummy dies as
claimed by AMD but we always knew they
were just defective Zeppelin dies that
were disabled but physically there as
after all thread Ripper is just an epic
CPU repurpose for the high-end desktop
platform that's it I don't mean to sound
like I'm downplaying anything here epic
CPUs on the desktop is very much epic
anyway for this 2nd gen thread Ripper
series amy has enabled those extra dives
to create the 24 core and 32 core models
the problem however is one of memory
bandwidth there simply isn't going to be
enough of it as I just discussed we
still only have quad-channel memory
access so the memory bandwidth remains
the same but now we have twice as many
cause to feed this is likely going to
make an already very niche product even
more focused so keep that in mind for
testing I've got a truckload of data and
while I tried to include as many CPUs as
possible I did run out of time to go
back and retest the core i7 87 or ok
this is something I can do in the
follow-up content that'll come over the
next week or two the good news is I have
results for a number of intel's high-end
desktop processors such as the core i
979 ATX II and the 79 60 X for example
rather than discuss the system specs and
go over all that stuff individually I'll
just throw them up on the screen and
some tables and if you want to examine
them a bit more closely you can hit the
pause button basically all systems were
configured with 32 gigabytes of ddr4
memory most of them are running at the
3200 spec using the XMP timings so
there's been no tuned memory timings in
any of these tests so having said all
that let's get some results ok so we
might as well get this one out of the
way first Cinebench r15 as many of you
are probably aware now given that AMD
did leaked the results the 2990 WX
achieves a score of just over 5,000
points in its stock out of the box
configuration that makes it a whopping
of 52 percent faster than the core I 979
80 XE and at this point you're probably
wondering what the hell I was on about
when I said there were some drawbacks to
this design but hold that thought we
will get to that later on anyway in this
rendering benchmark the 2990 WX has no
trouble
blowing socks completely off the 2950 X
is no slouch either though it does only
improve upon the 1950 X by a mere 5%
margin next up we have another rendering
benchmark though this one is based on
real-world software the Corona renderer
has been used to test workstations with
over 64 cores so it scales very well and
has no problem using all 32 cores and 64
threads of the 29 and 90 WX here we do
again see some pretty breathtaking
rendering performance from the 2990 WX
as it took just 41 seconds allowing it
to completely test 40% faster in the 29
50 X not perfect scaling but it is still
an impressive result this also meant
that it was 28% faster than intel's
current flagship core I know in part so
yeah that's also very impressive also
this time the 2950 X was just 4% faster
than the 1950 X so another small game
there but again all the same moving on I
fired up the rise in graphic workload in
blender now this is a relatively quick
test for these high-end CPUs and we see
that the 2990 WX took just 8.3 seconds
this meant it completed the workload 36%
faster than the 2950 X and 31% faster
the kora 979 ATX e again an impressive
completion time for the 2990 WX but it
has to be said for a doubling of cause
we are only seeing a 55% boost in
overall performance when compared to the
2150 X and there is only a minor clock
speed difference between the two so 55%
more performance for a 100% increase in
cause isn't that impressive that said I
am keen to see how the two compare in a
workload that takes significantly longer
than a few seconds for the 2990 WX to
complete so let's check that out
disappointingly though we do see this
much more complex gooseberry workload
was less favorable to the 2990 WX to be
fair it did still uproot the 79 80 XE
and kick it spins in but it was only
able to reduce the completion time by
28% when compared to the 29 50 X it was
able to reduce the render time by 20% we
compared to the more expensive 79 80 XE
so that's still obviously quite a great
result for AMD still it is a troubling
sign that in what should be an optimal
workload for the 2990 WX we're only
seeing a 38% increase in performance for
a 100% increase in cause okay so poverty
is the last rendering benchmark we're
going to look at and this one does bode
well for the 2990 WX here we are able to
reduce the rendering time by 40% we
compared to the 2950 X and this meant it
was 65% faster so again not amazing
scaling but at 65 percent it is much
better than what we saw in Corona and
blender it was also 57% faster than the
core o 9 79 80 XE so a massive win there
for AMD I've included the heavy
multitasking results from real bench
which runs image editing video
compression and rendering tasks
simultaneously AMD's new 32 core protest
saw a peak load of 70 percent but for at
least half the test the load was down
around 20 percent so that is worth
noting here we see the 2990 WX providing
a surprisingly poor result taking 43
seconds to complete the workload this
made the 32 core processor
lower than even the 1950 X and this
bench market really was the 2950 exit
impressed matching the core Oh 979 60 X
and 79 80 XC this meant the 2950 X was
able to complete the heavy multitasking
test six percent faster than 1950 X so
we get a pretty great result there PC
mark 10 has been included just to check
general performance there are no
oddities to speak of here the 2990 WX is
comparable to the core I know in 79 60 X
which is perfectly acceptable for a
super core heavy CPU the 2950 X does do
much better though as it comes in just
behind the 1920 X okay so moving on to
some spreadsheets excel is a real-world
application that we have been using a
benchmark CPUs for years and years now
so I thought why not try the Monte Carlo
simulation with the second gen thread
Ripper CPUs as expected the 2950 X is
slightly faster than the 1950s shaving
2% off the completion time meanwhile the
2990 W X is slower than the 2950 X are
basically matching the previous
generation 16 core parts so a bit of a
disappointing result there
AMD's Rison architecture has always
excelled for decompression work and we
see that the 2990 WX is no exception
absolutely smashing at the 7-zip 32
megabyte dictionary decompression test
with a throughput of 187,000 mips that
said it was just 31 percent faster than
the 2950 x despite packing 100% more cos
still AMD's SMT implementation works
wonders in this test and as a result the
2990 WX was 116 percent faster than the
kora 979 80 XE but as impressive as the
decompression performance is compression
performance leaves a lot to be desired
for compression work the core I 970 960
X was 9% fast in the 2150 X which isn't
a bad result for AMD there and it was
nice to see the 2150 X providing an 8%
boost over the 1950 X the 2990 WX though
well that one fell into a complete heap
despite 100% core utilization throughout
the test
performance was less than that of the
1920 X and just 23% higher than the
8-core 2700 X this memory sensitive test
gives us our first look at how Pauli
things can go for the 2990 WX it's
pretty ugly stuff and short of shutting
cos completely off there appears to be
no fix I'll look at this issue a bit
more closely later in the video but for
now let's continue with the application
benchmarks veracrypt provides a built-in
benchmark that allows users to test out
how various encryption algorithms
perform on a given system these tests
aren't run from slower local storage but
rather system memory and this proved to
be a problem for the 2990 WX please note
this benchmark uses 100% of the 2990 WX
all 64 threads are fully loaded so the
odd performance isn't a result of
underutilization there even if that was
the case it should at least match the 29
50 X the problem is what we have here is
another memory intensive benchmark
though I should note that it's not that
memory intensive the 50 megabyte test
only loads 50 megabytes of data into the
system memory so this has little impact
on the 2990 WX even though it was slower
than the 29 50 X and even the 1950 X the
one gigabyte buffer test though loads
one gigabyte worth of data into the
system memory and this proves to be a
massive issue for the 2990 WX it's 32
cause become choke to the point where
they're significantly slower than these
16 cause of the 29 50 X offering roughly
half the performance and so that's
pretty shocking to see we see a similar
story when encoding with handbrake
although the 2990 WX is significantly
only utilized in this test maxing out at
about 30% it still doesn't make up for
the poor performance under these
conditions you would expect it to at
least match the 29 50 X and it simply
fails to do so here the 29 50 X was 15%
faster than the 32 core processor though
I should note that it also offered no
real our performance gain over the older
1950 X meanwhile the 32 core processor
was only able to match the 1920 X which
is obviously a massive disappointment
speaking of massive disappointments this
one was
particularly disappointing for me we
found when encoding with Adobe Premiere
that the 2990 WX took 35 percent longer
to complete the workload when compared
to the 16 core 2950 X the good news here
though is the 2950 X was 7% quicker than
the 1950 X and that made it just 7%
slower than the core I 979 60 X so
pretty great result therefore the 2950 X
and well I don't know how else to put it
a disastrous result for the 2990 WX
although the export test only utilized
the 2950 X to the tune of about 90%
which to be fair is quite high
the 2990 WX was only seen to be utilized
at around 60% which you know isn't
particularly great for the warp
stabiliser test though we ran a dozen
instances simultaneously and that was
able to actually max out all 32 cores
and 64 threads of the 2990 WX despite
that the performance was still mighty
underwhelming and here the 32 core
process I was against slower than last
year's 12 core model and I only managed
to match the Intel 10 core sky like X
part so pretty shocking results
therefore the new 32 core processor but
the good news is the 2950 X wasn't
nearly as disappointing it was able to
shave five percent off the 1950 X's
completion time to take out top spots so
a pretty amazing result therefore the 16
core processor okay so why is the 2990
WX so disappointing in a lot of these
tests well as I alluded to earlier it is
100% down to memory bandwidth much more
so than core to core latency or memory
latency here we can see the sustained
memory bandwidth phage processor you'll
notice that the 2990 WX is a little down
on the 2950 x and that's due to the
added latency that dies without a memory
controller incur it's a 7 percent drop
in bandwidth but that alone doesn't
explain the performance issues seen so
far just to confirm those results I did
also test with a 264 and here is the
memory copy performance again the 2990
WX was down 7% on the 2950 x but that
alone doesn't explain the misery
performance in the encoding compression
and encryption benchmarks for that we
need to look at memory bandwidth per
core not the entire processor but rather
individual cause arranging these results
by a single threat we see that with just
one core active the Rison cpus enjoy a
tremendous bandwidth now please note the
performance of each core within the CPU
is measured individually and the result
you see here is the average bandwidth
across all individual cores
so the 2,700 X and 2950 X both
second-gen parts deliver the same 29
gigabytes per second then the first
generalizing parts deliver between 24
and 25 gigabytes per second and then we
have the 2990 WX at 20 gigabytes per
second this is why we saw a slight drop
in total memory bandwidth in the
previous test the margin is amplified
here showing the 2990 WX to be almost
30% slower as we're not limited by the
ddr4 memory in this instance the reason
the single core bandwidth is down is due
to the fact that 16 of the 32 cores
aren't connected directly to the memory
and therefore do suffer increased
latency finally we said that almost all
the skylake experts our limit is just 14
gigabytes per second though this is less
of an issue as fourteen gigabytes per
second per core is essentially overkill
and here's why if we rearrange this
graph by the all threads active result
the arrangement changes quite a bit now
for these results all CPU cores are
actively accessing system memory and
we're showing the average throughput of
an individual core essentially with the
CPU running at full steam in a memory
intensive workload this is the typical
amount of bandwidth each core has at its
disposal this here is the very problem
the 2950 ex enjoys a bandwidth a four
point four gigabytes per second per core
when maxed out and this is why the 14
gigabytes per second we saw with just a
single core active on the Intel CPUs
isn't an issue since the maximum
sustained bandwidth of a scale like X
processor is around 64 gigabytes per
second so technically with just 5 cause
active in an extremely memory intensive
workload you are going to use up all
that bandwidth and once you start adding
more cores you start to see a drop in
efficiency as they
fed enough data naturally the more cores
you have the worse you're going to end
up being in this test without increasing
the overall memory bandwidth with octave
channel memory the 2990 WX would indeed
better match the four point four
gigabytes per second per core of the
2950 X but with just quad-channel memory
that figure is halved well a little over
half due to the increased latency so bit
of a double whammy there in the end just
shy of two gigabytes per second of
bandwidth per core just isn't enough and
we see the problem this causes when
running memory sensitive applications
such as Varrick for example okay so
before we move on to overclocking power
consumption a few other tests let's
quickly go over gaming performance right
so AMD has stressed heavily stressed in
fact that the 2990 WX isn't a gaming CPU
though they have gone around now and put
on their website that it is a gaming CPU
but we'll touch on that later in the
video
anyway it's fair to say that the 2990 WX
really isn't a gaming CPU but I know you
guys are going to want to see how these
CPUs performing games and while the 2950
X does sort of make sense for gaming
having said that though games are still
struggling to utilize the eight core
2,700 X so they are going to benefit
from 32 cores and they certainly aren't
going to benefit from a design that the
29 and 90 WX features even so the 2990
WX isn't terrible ashes of the
singularity and whilst slower than the
2,700 X the performance is perfectly
fine we also see that the 2950 X takes a
small step from the 1950 X tacking on a
few more frames and overall delivering a
great gaming experience in this title
also remember that we are using a gtx
1080 TI at te p with the higher quality
preset which is two steps down from the
maximum quality had we used the extreme
or crazy presets than at least the top
half of the graph would have been
heavily GPU bound ok so these results
look a lot more brutal for the 2990 WX
though I should note that gameplay was
still very smooth with no stuttering and
frame rates did remain well over 60 fps
so there is that still the 32 core model
was well down on the new 16 core 2950 X
which averaged an impressive 153 FPS
then moving on we finest
a story when testing with f1 2017 the
2990 WX looks pretty much like a low-end
Pentium processor but at least it was
smooth and playable then we have the
2150 X which did manage to match the
2700 X and this meant it wasn't a great
deal slower than the most expensive
sculling xcp use the thread Ripper CPUs
do play very well in Assassin's Creed
origins taking out the top three spots
grant it at most they were just a few
frames fast and the Scarlet X parts but
still it is a great result as expected
though the 2990 WX does tank here and it
is noticeably slower and the other
process is tested before we move on from
gaming here's a quick look at the half
legacy mode for the 2990 WX this is a
feature that can be accessed in the
Rison master software essentially it's a
down core function that disables half of
the dies in the 2990 WX so two of the
dies and therefore 16 cause there is
also a quarter mode which basically
turns it into a 2700 X these legacy
modes are for software that doesn't work
well with all cores active software like
games for example as you can see in the
half legacy mode the 2990 WX sees a 10%
boost in performance when testing with
ashes of the singularity still a sure
the singularity wasn't really a bad
result what was a bad result was what
was seen in f1 2017 here we see a
massive 135 percent increase in
framerate and this allows the 2990 WX to
act very much like the 29 50 X so the
gaming performance can be fixed by
turning the 2990 WX no 2150 X but that's
hardly a practical solution I should
make it very clear that in order to
enable a legacy mode you need to execute
a full system reset so it's really only
something you'd use out of absolute
desperation and it would only be a very
temporary solution as I assume anyone
buying a 32 core processor once 32 cores
and not 16 all right if you're wondering
what the half legacy mode does for
applications here's a quick look at that
firstly memory bandwidth is increased
massively and it's actually now faster
than 2950 X and this is because we have
two dives using Numa opposed to the 2150
X which has two days using uma though
that's just the default so
you can change the 2950 X to use Numa
and that would see the same seventy five
point nine gigabytes per second just to
confirm that increase in bandwidth I
also around a to sixty four and here you
can see the peak throughput now exceeds
eighty eight gigabytes per second on
that note please note that this figure
is higher than the seventy six gigabytes
per second reported by SCI software
because here we're reporting the peak
throughput rather than the sustained
throughput here we see that the inherent
issues with the twenty nine ninety WX is
solved and that issue is of course per
core bandwidth with the more memory
bandwidth overall and half as many cores
to feed we see a little over twice their
bandwidth now available to each core now
although the bandwidth per core has
improved we do only have half as many
new cause and this means in workloads
where the 2990 WX did do well previously
it's going to be a lot slower and now
produce similar performance to that of
the 2950 X is that essentially what it
is now we do see that and blend up the
same is also true for povery basically
the 2990 WX is delivering 2950 X light
performance not that surprising however
where the 2990 WX was slow in the 2950 x
we are now seeing comparable performance
as shown here when retesting with
handbrake another example is Adobe
Premiere Pro CC the warp stabiliser
workload and here the 2990 WX in the
half legacy mode doesn't quite match the
2150 X but the results are certainly
much closer now so that's how the half
legacy mode works that's not practical
or particularly useful in my opinion but
the options there if you get desperate
enough moving on we have some power
consumption figures and here we see
these slightly higher clock 29 50x
consumed 10% more power than that of the
1950 X under full load in the corona
benchmark and this placed it on par with
the core i9 is 70 900 X then we have the
32 cored 2990 WX pushing total system
consumption up to 383 watts which is 19%
more than that of the core I nine 79 80
XE still that is only a 36% increase
over the 29 50x at least for the total
system load so that's not bad given that
you do have 100 percent more cores which
do
to complete this workload 40% faster
before moving on a quick note on
temperatures using the Wraiths Ripper
the 29 90 X around and a very cool 59
degrees though the fan did spin up to
2,300 rpm and while not overly loud it
was clearly audible the 2950 X ran a few
degrees cooler at 56 degrees and this
allowed the 120-millimeter found in the
Wraiths Ripper to spin around 200 rpm
low which did help reduce the operating
volume okay so time to overclock and
please note I didn't have a huge amount
of time to delve into overclocking and
it certainly isn't the focus of this
content we can certainly follow up with
a more in-depth look into overclocking
and future content for this review I
tried two methods of overclocking one it
using the rog Zenith extreme using the
Isuzu precision boost override and then
another one using the MSI Meg external
creation using the old fashioned
multiplier and fixed voltage method both
methods resulted in fairly similar
multi-core performance though it has to
be said the asou speeds significantly
better single core performance here we
see the fixed frequency overclocked
yield slightly better results in the
blender test though I should emphasize
only very slightly the 2950 X was able
to complete the Orenda 12 percent
quicker while the 2990 WX was just 4
percent faster which which is
disappointing given that we saw a 20%
boost in Cinebench ok so these are some
pretty alarming results overclocked to
the 2990 WX saw at least an 81 percent
increase in total system draw and up to
97 percent with the fixed voltage here
we can see why fixing 32 cores at 4
gigahertz using one point 4 volts is a
bad idea the idle consumption was 192
Watts more than that of a stock rising 7
1800 X at full steam and about what the
1920 X draws under load using the asou
speed the idle draw is roughly half down
to 95 watts but even say the low
consumption still hits an isle watering
694 watts in this test I say in this
test because I observed total power draw
hitting 780 watts in Cinebench and 884
watts for the fixed voltage overclock
this is probable
AMD suggests that if you plan on
overclocking the 32 core processor you
pack at least a 1000 watt power supply
interestingly despite promoting
overclocking on these unlocked parts aim
D says that if you overclock or use P Bo
you will void your warranty not sure how
they'll enforce that one but they are
claiming that any form of overclocking
will void your warranty on these second
gen fedra per CPU so that's something to
keep in mind just quickly here are a few
simulated benchmarks using the down core
function to turn the 2990 WX in no.29 70
WX the 24 core part and then the 29 50 X
into the 29 20 X which is of course the
12 core part 429 70 WX should score
around 4,300 points while the 12 core
model will be good for around 2600
points in the corona benchmark 429 70 WX
sits between the twenty nine ninety WX
and Cora nine seventy nine eighty XE
while the twenty nine twenty X is a
fraction faster than the 1920 X as
expected
then when testing with blender we see at
the twenty nine seventy WX took just
five percent longer to complete this
test which isn't bad given it has 25%
less cause this might indicate the 24
model won't suffer nearly as badly as
the 32 core model when all cores are
fully utilized and accessing system
memory but I'll have to look into that
one a bit more then of course the 29 20
X will be a slight upgrade from the 1920
X as a bonus round I've included a he
per memory scaling data for the twenty
nine ninety WX ranging from ddr4 1866 up
to the maximum spec I could get to work
which was ddr4 3400 here we see
consistent scaling right up to 3400 and
how I've been able to get faster memory
to work it's likely we would have seen a
steady increase right to 4,000 and
beyond this right here is why Cinebench
r15 is a completely useless application
for measuring any kind of memory
performance and it's also why either
2990 WX smashes it out of the park in
this test it's just not at all memory
sensitive yes you can adjust timings and
see small gains but yeah you're not
gonna see great gains Krone is another
benchmark that just really isn't that
memory sensitive either
at least again within reason it's not
until we drop down a ddr4 1866 which
isn't really a thing I suppose that we
see a major drop-off in performance from
ddr4 29:33 and Beyond there's really no
gains to be had 7-zip is a memory
sensitive application and this is best
demonstrated by the decompression test
however it was the compression test that
really hurt the 2990 wx-- and therefore
don't really see the results that we'd
probably expect to see here perhaps the
increased latency is also an issue for
this test I'm not 100% sure on that one
we will need to do a bit more digging to
find out what's going on well that was
plenty of data though in some ways I
feel like we're just starting to scratch
the surface on this one especially with
the 2990 WX over the next few weeks so
do want to spend as much time as I can
with this processor looking into various
productivity workloads um see what I can
throw at it and see if I can find
anything that's not a rendering workload
that performs really well anyway
for now let's have a look at a couple of
price versus performance scatter plots
before I wrapping this long review up
let's take a look at the poverty as the
2990 WX had it the best showing here
it's much faster than a 70 night ATX eat
while costing slightly less so that's
obviously a good thing and that means
for rendering tasks the 2990 WX really
is the bee's knees and while it might
not offer the best value overall it
certainly provides the best value at the
top end of the scale the 2950 x destroys
the kora 970 900 X offering
significantly more performance at a
reduced price
really the only better option here is
the heavily discounted 1950 X still in
poverty second gen 3 Ripper CPUs look
very good the only other price versus
performance scatterplot that we're going
to look at is premiere and this pretty
much sums up the 2990 WX when handling
non rendering tasks here we see how
badly things can go for AMD's new 32
core processor when encoding with
premier the 2990 WX is considerably
worse value than the core I know in 79
80 XE and therefore rather CPU tested
you're basically looking at thread
ripper 1920 x performance for almost
four times the price
thankfully though the 2950 x is again a
resale adoption and office pretty much
the best bang for your buck of any of
the new CPUs tested well the twenty nine
ninety WX certainly an unusual beast in
short aim DS made a thirty-two core CPU
that appears very good for rendering and
that was about it in our standard test
suite the memory limitations do seem to
make the twenty nine ninety WX a a very
focused product and I'm not sure how
many users are going to find it useful
for powering their workstations given
the inconsistent results that said I am
in the process of conducting some
extensive multitasking benchmarks and
while I am still seeing some mixed
results I think overall what I am seeing
is painting a more positive picture I
would also just like to note that Amie
themselves have admitted that this is a
focused product and that's why they
changed the name to include the W before
the X so it's not just the 2990 X and
they also show in their review guide
that the 2990 WX beats the 79-80 XE in
applications such as or benchmarks such
as Corona a blender Cinebench pas vrai
mayor and a dope dimension and of course
what are all those programs have in
common their rendering applications of
course
meanwhile the 2950 X was tested against
the Coraline 7900 X in programs such as
handbrake TrueCrypt 7-zip premiere and
then of course a few other rendering
applications so all the 2950 X can
clearly do it all as we've shown in this
video
aim DS well aware that the 2990 WX can't
I think that's probably the best way to
put it the only issue I have is that
they're not exactly telling you that at
least not by the information that I
found on their website and rather than
give you a chance to work out that the
32 core model might not be all it's
cracked up to be for your particular
workload they took pre-orders for only
that part a week in advance I did voice
these concerns with my AMD contacts over
the weekend and they assured me that
anyone who is unhappy with how the 2990
WX performs for their particular
workload can cancel their pre-order no
money should have exchanged hands at
this point but if it has they can
refund and get something else maybe the
2950 ex so we're not ready to close the
book on the 2990 WF just yet but given
that there are some obvious shortcomings
we feel the $1,800 us asking prices it's
just a bit much the core I know in
seminar ad XE is already grossly
overpriced as it is but at least it does
do everything really well and doesn't
really have any weaknesses other than
the price itself which is obviously
quite a big weakness in terms of price
versus performance which is why we much
prefer the 2950 X but it doesn't suffer
any performance issues where it's much
slower than the lower core parts in its
product family of course the 2990 WX has
all the usual problems a super core
heavy desktop processor would happen
that is utilization finding software
that can fully utilize it but of course
the key key here is the software can't
be really heavy on memory access or it
will cripple the 2990 W X to the point
where it's a slow as a mainstream
desktop CPU this ultimately is the issue
with the 2990 W X where perfectly fine
with most software such as premiere for
example not taking advantage of 64
threads but in that case the 2990 WX
should act like a 29 50 X and as we've
seen that's not always the case and
sometimes it is much slower so how do
you know if a particular workload will
cripple the 2990 WX or run like a dream
unless you have someone test it out for
you test drive the CPU you really don't
know and it's not enough for them just
to test the software you'll be using
it's that sensitive that you really need
the kinds of workloads tested that
you're using
I think AMD should have just done a
better job of stating what the 2990 W X
is designed for rendering workloads show
where is really good and I'm talking
about their website here not what
they've told reviewers or anything like
that forget the media I'm talking about
telling the consumers for the pre-orders
that it does have some shortcomings in
heavily bandwidth dependent workloads
the performance may be lower than
expected see I think stuff like that
would have just helped clear this up
based on our testing we've found it to
pretty much be the thread Ripper Pixar
Edition or maybe instead of
w they could have called it the 2990 CB
edition that would have made more sense
anyway like I said we're just not ready
to call it yeah the 2990 WX still has
more to prove but at this point I think
it is quite clear that I personally
won't be upgrading my workstation to the
32 core processor which is a bit of a
disappointment still I will be getting
an upgrade and that upgrade will be the
real hero of the second gen third Ripper
series it's no secret that I really
liked the 1950 X and the 2950 X is
simply a more refined version typically
offering five to eight percent more
performance while coming in a hundred
dollars u.s. less at launch so great by
that and right now though the 1950 X
that is coming in at 780 dollars u.s. so
that one is a cracking good buy right
now but still considering the 2950 X's
introductory price it's it's really
amazing value I have nothing bad to say
about the 2950 exit does everything
really well and in my opinion it takes
over from the 1950 X as the ultimate
high-end desktop CPU I had really hoped
that my editing rig would be receiving
the 32 core part but as I said before
those plans have now been scrapped and I
will be moving to the 29 50 X instead of
course if you have a 1950 X already like
I did then the 29 50 X doesn't really
offer a noteworthy or worthwhile upgrade
as I said it's only about five to eight
percent so it's not really worth
scrapping at the 1950 X yet so yeah your
CPU hasn't been rendered obsolete just
yet and that is going to do it for this
one I hope you guys did enjoy this video
I know it was a very long-winded look at
the second generation thread Ripper CPUs
