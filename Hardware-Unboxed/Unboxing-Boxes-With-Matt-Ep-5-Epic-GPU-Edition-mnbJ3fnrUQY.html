of unboxing boxes with Matt I believe
this is episode five today I definitely
have the most epic box that I've ever
unboxed on hand but we'll be getting to
that a little later first let's take a
look at this product from deep cool this
is the captain 240 X I heard from a few
people that this thing was you damn good
all pretty cool looking cooler so I'm
looking forward to putting this into my
next build let's pull out the block you
can have a bit of a look as you can see
it's all red pretty cool-looking so keep
an eye out for that all right next up
we've got Logitech's refresh of the
Orion of the g 9 10 orion spectrum well
this is the RA this is the Orion spectra
in the last one was the Orion spot there
was a couple of little things that a lot
of people complained about on that
keyboard and the main one I think was
the key caps they're quite sharp ridges
on them so this is the Refresh model I
believe it smoothed out this key cap to
their pretty much standard
so that's it I think as well the wrist
rest is a bit smaller the last one came
with two options but this one's just got
the one so I'll be comparing that to the
previous model in a video in the next
couple weeks alright this is the epic
box but i'll do that next I think this
one's pretty damn cool too alright so
here we've got a card from Pallet so
when I looked at the 10 80s game with
gel H probably one of the best ones I
saw in terms of value it's pretty good
too so this this is from Pallet yep
basically the same brand same company
just two different branding voila so
this is the GTX 1070 game rock edition
alright so in here I believe we have a
custom water block for this card and
it's from bitspower so it would seem
like they're saying I'm some sort of
partnership the palette now maybe I'll
pull it out so you guys can check it out
it's pretty cool looking block that was
pretty damn cool with some liquid
flowing through it I guess the plan is
to build it into my core Pete rebuild so
draining it's going to be a bit of a
bitch but it'll be worth it that's the
back if you're interested it's also got
a custom back plate of course as well so
yeah looking forward to putting that
thing together checking out the car's
performance and just so you can check
out what that card looks like that's it
so white and blue it's pretty pretty it
looks like it's got some lighting so you
do that shrouds coming off anyway
alrighty so it's time to unbox what I'm
hoping is the most epic unboxing I've
ever unboxed at all times so I know this
is from Nvidia and man if it's not what
I think it is then
dating you pretty disappointed so cross
your fingers and your toes wow so it's
exactly what I hoped it was we've got
the new tight necks and the best part is
it's not just one mother's two of them
so man holy crap I cannot wait you can
test these now obviously two of these is
going to be absolutely overkill for one
4k monitor so I had a feeling I was
getting two of these in the mail so i
did put out a request for three 4k
monitors so you could do some surround
gaming testing which I've never really
messed around with before so I'm super
pumped for that and I've also got the
battlefield beta code today so you guys
want to see some gameplay with these two
cards together and please let me know I
don't normally do just single game
footage stuff but you are interested let
me know in the comments and now we can
check it out
oh that is the new Pascal hotness almost
all black design your damn cool lot of
FPS on one table they have a guy's duel
tight and content coming your way I
absolutely cannot wait to set these up
in sli obviously and placing games in
particular battlefield one so again let
me know if you want to see that footage
if you don't hear from me for a few days
it's because I'm on benchmark lockdown
