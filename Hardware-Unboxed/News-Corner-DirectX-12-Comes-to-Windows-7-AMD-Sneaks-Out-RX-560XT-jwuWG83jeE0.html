corner it's episode 50 so I reckon that
calls for a little bit of a celebration
anyway the big session that happened
this week was probably the launch of the
nvidia geforce gtx 1660 you can check
out Steve's review of that card
yesterday I did read some comments about
the pricing data that we used in that
video as always that data does change
rapidly and we made that video a week in
advance so Steve who go on holiday so
naturally prices did change a little bit
but not really enough to significantly
alter the conclusion for example the gtx
1660 is still a better buy at $220 then
$190 RX 580 which is I guess the typical
price right now aside from that one card
on a limited time discount at that price
both cards are about the same value but
the gtx 1660 is a decent amount faster
so it's probably worth spending the
extra thirty dollars or so to get the
faster product the RX 590 and as low as
$220 also isn't quite cutting it given
it's the same price as the MSRP for the
1660 yet it's slower on average and I
thinks people have more on this in a
bigger benchmark video next week onto
the news stories of the week this one
came as a big surprise for the gaming
community DirectX 12 is now available on
Windows 7 in fact is that a good reason
to use another one of these I've got a
few still remaining I mean you know why
not since the launch of DX 12 it has
only been available on Windows 10 which
has been a problem for developers as
many gamers are still using Windows 7
this effectively meant that any
developer that wanted to use the X 12
also had to create a DX 11 version for
games that refused to upgrade to
Microsoft's latest OS today that's no
longer the case Microsoft said they've
ported the user-mode d 3d twelve runtime
to Windows 7 which unboxed developers
who want to take full advantage of the
latest improvements in d3 D 12 while
still supporting customers on older
operating systems however it's not a
situation where all DX 12 games will now
magically run on Windows seven instead
each game will need an update to support
the ported d3 d12 runtime for Windows 7
presumably supporting this runtimes a
lot easier than supporting an entire
separate dx11 version the first game to
make use of this is World of Warcraft
with the lattice 81.5 game patch
Microsoft says they're working with
other developers to port their dx12
games to Windows 7 they also claim the
juda critical OS improvements DirectX 12
games will still run better in Windows
10 which might be something we should
benchmark to be honest I find
Microsoft's reasoning for now suddenly
supporting DirectX 12 Windows 7 a bit
amusing they say at Microsoft we make
every effort to respond to customer
feedback so when we receive this
feedback from blizzards and other
developers we decided to act on it find
a bit hard to believe that Microsoft has
only just now received this feedback
given Windows 10 as nearly four years
old and the lack of dx12 supported
Windows 7 has been a major complaint for
gamers that don't care for Windows 10 at
all from one angle the timing is also a
bit strange given Windows 7 will hit an
end of support state in January 2020 on
the other hand Microsoft was clearly
using DirectX 12 as an incentive to get
gamers to upgrade to Windows 10 there
really hasn't been a genuine technical
reason why DirectX 12 wouldn't work with
Windows 7 has always been an artificial
limitation to make Windows 10 more
attractive but at this point four years
after launch I think mark soft believe
that anyone that was gonna upgrade to
Windows 10 has done so by now
the remaining Windows 7 users probably
aren't gonna upgrade anytime soon given
if had plenty of time to do so but
really makes the upgrad incentive
unnecessary now with so many developers
releasing jewel dx11 dx12 games though
also hasn't been much of an incentive to
upgrade to access specific games so at
this point the best thing for developers
and the best thing overall is simply to
foster dx12 adoption and make it
available to all gamers hopefully this
will drive better dx12 implementations
because there's still plenty of games
where the dx11 mode runs better so yeah
this is pretty big news for those on
Windows 7 both AMD and NVIDIA say that
with their latest drivers DirectX 12
should work in Windows 7 with World of
Warcraft it will be interesting to see
what other games will get updated with
Windows 7 support some titles like
Shadow the Tomb Raider that before
a lot better in the dx12 mode would be
prime candidates the other big story
from this week is that NVIDIA has bought
Mellanox for six point nine billion u.s.
dollars earlier report suggested both
Intel and NVIDIA were in the race to
purchase the company with Intel offering
around 6 billion Nvidia is bid was
larger so it won the race and the
acquisition should complete at the end
of the year so what do Mellanox do well
they are a data center networking
company so not really related to the
usual stuff we cover on this channel
we're talking about you know networks
which isn't Hardware enterprises
connectivity tech and all that sort of
stuff there's usually only seen in the
background with Nvidia making big pushes
into the data center with their GPU
products acquiring Mellanox that allows
them to also provide other hardware for
those projects this is an all-cash deal
and videos paying $125 per share so
around 14% above the previous closing
price we probably won't hear too much
more about Mellanox for a while given we
are mostly interested in envious
consumer cheap use but it does add to
their growing portfolio of products
nicely OMB has quietly launched the
Radeon rx 560 XT for the Chinese market
the XT brand was famously used for many
of Amy's older products back in the
Radeon HD year so it's nice to see that
make a little bit of a comeback here the
GPU itself is a pretty interesting
product as well the RX 560 xt is much
closer to an RX 570 than an RX 560 but
it isn't either of those GPUs so it's
not a straight rave round of those cards
it seems to be a cut-down rx 570 which
itself is a cut-down Polaris 20 die what
we're left with is 1792 stream
processors down from the 2048 in the RX
570 but much higher than the 1024 in the
RX 569 XT we're also looking at the same
256 bit gddr5 bus at the RX 570 rather
than the 128 bit bus used in the RX 560
clock speeds are lower than both the rx
560 and 570 with the 973 megahertz pace
and 10 73 megahertz boost on with 6.6
gigabit per second memory however this
still makes it much faster than an Rx
560 but a decent amount below an Rx 570
according to AMD's benchmarks while it
is a China only product you would still
expect pricing to
aiex 570 and IAC's 560 as well so
probably around the equivalent of 120
dollars given a $100 ox 560 and 140
dollar RX 570 as video cards notes while
this isn't a dodgy rebrand of the RX 5 6
2 r RX 570 this does look like just a
slightly different version of the also
china exclusive RX 470 date i guess
there really isn't all how much more you
can do with Polaris Silicon these days
the halo Master Chief collection is
coming to PC and in the surprise move
from Microsoft is coming to steam as
well as the Windows Store hopefully this
is a bit of a strategy ship for
Microsoft there have been a few
murmurings that suggest Microsoft is
going to take a more open approach to
games rather than trying to lock down
everything as an exclusive we'll
probably find out more about that with
the next generation of consoles but this
move to release Halo and steam rather
than the awful Microsoft Store could be
the early beginnings of this it'll also
benefit gamers and Microsoft pockets
because plenty of PC gamers refused to
buy anything from the Microsoft Store
sure Microsoft would love people buying
stuff from their own store exclusively
but the reality is offering games on a
wide variety of platforms including
those that are popular with games like
steam can lead to increase sales and
lower piracy fingers crossed Microsoft
continued to take this approach with
their other game releases as for the
Master Chief collection itself this will
be the first time several Halo games
will come to PC including halo 3 halo 3
ODST Halo Reach and halo 4 the
collection also includes the original
Halo and halo 2 with Halo Reach new to
the collection overall 343 Industries is
going to stagger the release so buyers
will receive the games in chronological
order starting with reach they're moving
through combat Evolved halo 2 and so on
they'll also be support for PC standard
features such as custom resolutions
aspect ratios frame rates and so on the
first of invidious big format gaming
displays is now here in the HP omen X
Imperium these massive TV slash gaming
display things were first announced at
CES 2018 so it's taken a little while
for them to become available but HP is
now selling this for a super-high five
thousand dollar u.s. price tag the
display itself is a 65-inch 4k MV a
panel that refreshes up to 144 Hertz and
fully supports HDR with up to
to peak brightness a 384 zone fa LD
backlight and 95% DCI p3 coverage it
also has a g-sync module inside an end
of contrast ratio of 4,000 to 1 and 4
millisecond response times with
overdrive and there's a soundbar
included comparing this display to
regular PC monitors does make it look
pretty impressive you get proper HDR
support 4k up to 144 hertz g-sync and so
on and it's 65 inches but the comparison
isn't as favorable up against modern TVs
Samsung for example will sell you a
high-end 65 inch q 90 q LED TV for 3500
us which packs at 4k resolution up to
120 Hertz free sync and excellent HDR
you don't get G sync but it's overall a
lot cheaper and LG's flagship all mtv's
as well offer more features for less
money I am interested to test one of
these guys to see what they're like but
fortunately this point I haven't had
much success securing a reviewnit also
suspect there will be supination product
for games that specifically want a TV
size display with g-sync and a 144 Hertz
refresh rate I think that invidious lack
of support for adaptive sync over HDMI
is buying them a little bit here given
what TVs are doing and ones that have
come into the market right now final
topic for this week asa has launched a
49 inch ultra wide gaming monitor called
the ei4 9 1 CR it's a 32 9 be a pal at
38 40 by 1080 so double wide 1080p it
has a 144 Hertz refresh rate and free
sync to support through display HDR 400
certification that said without proper
local dimming this isn't really an HDI
display it's nice to see more of these
high refresh super ultra wise hit the
market
this one will cost $900 and should
become available in the next few months
