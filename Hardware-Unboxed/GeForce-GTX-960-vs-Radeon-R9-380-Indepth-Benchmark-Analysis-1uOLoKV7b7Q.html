I'm your host Matt and today we'll be
doing an ultimate comparison of the gtx
960 and the r9 380 to see which is the
best sub $200 GPU as exciting as the
geforce gtx 980ti
and Radeon r9 fury X are the sub $200
GPU market is where the real battles
take place let's be honest around $200
has always brought your GPU plenty of
power and today things are no different
the gtx 960 and r9 380 offer plenty of
rendering power and a more than
sufficient for 1080p gaming which is the
most popular resolution of the gamers if
you jump on any computer forum and ask
the question which should I buy the
geforce gtx 960 or the Radeon r9 380
you're bound to get varying opinions
coming your way at a great note of speed
as both have their strengths and
weaknesses the geforce gtx 960 is
hands-down the more efficient GPU
consuming anywhere from twenty to forty
percent less power this typically means
that the 960 will also run a little
cooler though overclockers can expect to
extract around 20% more frequency from
each GPUs core the Radeon r9 380 on the
other hand should be a little faster
which will help offset that extra power
consumption testing with just a few
select games doesn't really give you the
full picture so for this head-to-head
battle we've selected 22 of the latest
and most popular graphically intense
games to run the 960 and 380 through
testing takes place at 1080p as well as
the more desirable 2560 by 1440
resolution on top of that we'll be
testing each game with two different
quality settings for example battlefield
4 was tested using the maximum in-game
quality settings with two times multi
sample anti-aliasing enabled and then
again with a a disable completely The
Witcher 3 has been tested with hair
works enabled and then disabled while
Tomb Raider was tested with and without
tress affects both GPUs were tested
using a core i5 6600 K processor under a
fresh install of Windows 10 with the
latest drivers install
all that being said let's jump into the
benchmarks in Metro redux the 960
enjoyed an 8 frame per second advantage
at 1080p with tessellation set to very
high with tessellation disabled is the
380 that's faster by 5 frames per second
though both GPUs exceeded 60 frames per
second on average in Tomb Raider with
tress effects enabled the 380 has an
obvious advantage and we see at
rendering 18 frames per second more than
the 960 at 1080p disabling tress-fx
reduces the performance margin
significantly in yet now the 380 is just
5 frames per second faster with both
GPUs rendering over 70 frames per second
on average at 1080p battlefield 4 is a
close fight though the 380 is able to
take the lead beating the 960 by 4 FPS
at 1080p with
MSAA enabled turning off anti-aliasing
Brewster 960 to an average of 70 frames
per second though the 380 was slightly
faster with 73 frames per second the 380
was significantly faster in thief
delivering 9 frames per second more at
1080p with super sampling anti-aliasing
enabled disabling SSA a reduced the
deficit to just 4 frames per second and
both GPUs rendered over 70 frames per
second on average just 3 frames per
second and favored to 380 at 1080p and
watchdog's with HBO plus set to high as
expected with HBO completely disabled
the 380 pulled further ahead of the 960
increasing the margin out to 8 frames
per second
testing kipman absolution with FXAA we
see that the 380 is significantly faster
than the 960 producing an extra 40
frames per second the exact same 40
frames per second margin can be seen
when testing with two times msaa as the
Radian I know 380 proves it's the best
option for hitman the GTA 5 performance
is extremely competitive a 1080p the 380
was just a single frame faster than the
960 similar margins were seen when
reducing the quality settings to higher
though both were very smooth near the
GPU had any trouble delivering highly
playable performance and civilization
beyond Earth delivering over 70 frames
per second on average still the 380 was
4 frames per second faster
disabling anti-alias
boosted performance slightly and
extended the three eighties lead after
six frames per second using the highest
possible in-game quality settings with
MLA I enabled the frame rates using
these mid-range graphics cards are very
low still the 380 was 2 frames per
second faster of 1080p lowering the
quality settings to the ultra preset
with MLA enabled we see that performance
improves drastically and now the 960 is
5 frames per second faster than 380
witcher 3 wild hunt results are
surprising as the 380 is faster than the
960 with hair works enabled 5 frames per
second faster in fact the latest version
of The Witcher 3 is improved hair works
performance and AMD has obviously made
great strides with their drivers as well
turning off hair works actually reduced
the margin to just 4 frames per second
still favoring the 380 the 960 didn't
enjoy Middle Earth shadow of Mordor with
an average of just 39 frames per second
making it 15 frames per second slower
than the 380 reducing the quality
settings from ultra to high didn't
really help out the 960 much at least in
terms of caching the 380 the 960 is now
17 frames per second slower than the 380
Assassin's Creed unity is another game
where AMD dominates as the 380 average
19 frames per second more than the 960
at 1080p using percentage closest soft
shadows and screen space ambient
occlusion testing again with pcs s and s
sao disabled we see that a 380 is now
just 9 frames per second faster than the
960 using sub pixel morphological
anti-aliasing the 960 averaged 36 frames
per second at 1080p in Crysis 3 while
the 380 was 5 frames per second faster
with 41 frames per second changing the
fast approximate anti-aliasing allowed
for quite a lot of extra performance
from these GPUs and the 380 was now just
three frames per second faster than the
960 testing Dragon Age Inquisition with
true by MSAA enabled
the 380 was found to be five frames per
second faster than the 960 with 50
frames per second on average disabling
AAA and changing from H Bao to SSAO
source similar margins as the 380 was
faster by 4 frames per second first up
we tested ARMA 3 using FXAA and this
gave the 380 a 4 frame per second
advantage with 53 frames per second on
average disabling all forms of AAA
didn't change the performance margin as
the 380 was still 4 frames per second
faster than the 960 in grid Autosport
even with four times msaa enabled both
GPUs easily cracked 60 frames per second
at 1080p the 380 was 5 frames per second
faster dropping msaa the CMA a boost
performance further though this time it
is the 960 that's faster winning by 4
frames per second in f1 2015 the 960
delivered a rare victory over the 380
though we should point out that it was
just a mere 1 frame faster turning SMA a
and ti a off didn't change the
performance trends really is both GPUs
delivered the exact same performance
with 74 frames per second each the 380
was 3 frames per second faster than 916
far cry 4 at 1080p with an average of 35
frames per second using H Bao and 2
times MSAA
testing with s SBC and SMA where you
gain found that the 380 is 3 frames per
second faster than the 960 dying light
is another game that provides a rare win
for the 960 as it was 4 frames per
second faster than 380 at 1080p turning
off anti-aliasing depth of field and
horizon based ambient occlusion helped
the GTX 960 extended lead over the 380
to 6 frames per second the 380 average
49 frames per second in Sleeping Dogs at
1080p making 6 frames per second faster
than the 916 reducing the fxaa level and
disabling SSA a the frame rates
increased significantly to over 100
frames per second the 960 was still 5
frames per second slower than the 380
though at these frame rates the
difference will certainly go unnoticed
as expected the geforce gtx 960 was
faster in project cars this game is a
bit of a sore point for AMD
still with 53 frames per second the 960
were just four frames per second faster
than the 380 disabling msaa and changing
from SMA a to fxaa greatly improves
performance of both GPUs though the 960
is now 7 frames per second faster The
Brady on i-93 80 average 62 frames per
second in Call of Duty advanced warfare
at 1080p making it 3 frames per second
slower than the 960 changing SMA for
FXAA as well as disabling SSA a we see
that both GPUs deliver considerably
better performance the 960 was just 4
frames per second faster than 380 though
again with well over 100 frames per
second on average this difference of go
unnoticed for years now aimed is
consistently provided the best value
mainstream graphics cards and this is
again the case when comparing the r9 380
to the GTX 960 for those not concerned
with power consumption and let's be
honest when it comes to mid-range
graphics cards consumption isn't really
a big issue the Radeon r9 380 is the
obvious choice AMD drivers didn't appear
to throw up any issues either with
consistent performance in all titles in
fact with 22 games tested the r9 380 was
faster in over 80% of them on average
the GTX 960 was 6 percent slower than
the r9 380 when looking at the 44
results recorded by each GPU at 1080p
using the two different test settings
breaking those results down we find that
when using the more demanding quality
settings the gtx 960 was an average 9%
slower for an average of 49 frames per
second as opposed to 54 frames per
second from the r9 380
the less demanding quality setting saw
the gtx 960 trail by just a 4% margin
with an average of 67 frames per second
opposed to 70 frames per second for the
r9 380
so while the Radeon r9 380 is clearly a
faster choice gtx 960 users don't have
much to worry about as the margins I
noticed blew most games three months ago
we selected two gtx 960 for our entry
level gaming PFC build as it was the
best value option at the time though
today we would substitute it for the
punchier Radeon r9 380
well I hope that settles the $200
mainstream GPU battle for now I'd love
