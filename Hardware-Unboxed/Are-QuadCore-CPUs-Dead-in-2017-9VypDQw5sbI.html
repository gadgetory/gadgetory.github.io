we're talking about quad-core CPUs and
where they stand for game is in late
2017 now this isn't a benchmark video
I've kind of already done all the
testing needs to be done the subject for
now rather I'm going to discuss a few
thoughts and opinions so earlier this
year the world's tech media which
included myself raved about the pentium
g 4560 and well why not it was basically
a cable 8 core i3 for an incredibly low
64 dollars us the generation prior you
were looking at spending twice that
amount of money to get the same level of
performance the g 45 60 also obliterated
anything AMD had an offer in the sub
$100 u.s. price range with two cores
clocked at 3.5 gigahertz plus the aid of
hyper-threading we found it to be very
capable and the perfect budget pairing
for something like the geforce gtx 1060
or radeon r X 480 the G 45 60 was such a
great Buy
that even passionate aim D Farren's were
willing to stick their hand up and say
yeah that's pretty good
despite that though there were those
that argued no matter the price the G 45
60 was junk and a dual-core CPU in 2017
was a bad joke I'd probably agree if the
G 45 60 lacked hyper threading supportin
wasn't able to deliver playable
performance in all the latest games now
don't even bother try to tell me it
can't handle 64 player battlefield 1
action sure it might stutter every now
and then but I found delivers an
enjoyable and certainly very
satisfactory experience for what you're
paying performance might look a bit
ordinary when paired with a GeForce GTX
1080 T I'm sure that does suggest a
limited lifespan but it does also cost
less than $100 and works well with $200
GPUs therefore it's my opinion that
right now in late 2017 the Pentium G 45
60 is still a viable option and really
is a great solution for entry-level
budget gaming you know for guys that can
live with the odd frame hitch now and
then in extremely demanding titles so
that being the case what do I make of
quad-core CPUs for gaming in 2007
well I feel like I've said or what I've
said so far kind of covers that one but
let's go down that rabbit hole anyway
recently when we reviewed the rise in
three twelve hundred and found that it
was an exceptionally good value CP for
budget gamers with its four
overclockable cause the vast majority of
you seem to accept that of course once
again there were those claiming that
quad-core CPUs are dead and have no
right being used as gaming CPUs in 2017
I also hear stuff like this probably
quite a bit more actually when talking
about CPU such as the core i5 7600 K as
if the are three twelve hundred and
seventy six hundred K are anyway
comparable in terms of gaming
performance this right here is the heart
of the issue for me it just seems like
some people tend to generalize a bit too
much just because one quad-core CPU
might offer a bad experience in modern
titles it certainly doesn't mean they
all will unless of course we're talking
about the absolute fastest quad-core CPU
but based on my own experiences I find
that a bit hard to believe now this most
recently came up in an unboxing boxes
episode of horror videos when discussing
the new asrock mini ITX a m4 motherboard
I said something on the lines of how
this would be a perfect home theater pc
type gaming rig with the Rison 3 1200
and a mid-range GPU and a shoebox sized
PC case but my hull was quick to shoot
that idea down though and seemed rather
annoyed that I even entertained the idea
of recommending the quad core rise and
three CPU to gamers he also claimed
today's games require a minimum of six
to eight threads we went back and forth
on the issue and he also claimed that
the core i5 7600 K doesn't provide
smooth gaming performance claiming that
it will experience dramatic frame drops
whenever the OS decides to do stuff in
the background or drawl call heavy
workloads appear in a PC game I don't
mean to single this particular viewer
out even though I realized that I just
sort of have but anyway some of the
points made were valid at least they
would be with a bit more context I
picked this comment though because it is
a very recent comment and it's really in
line with other comments that I've seen
on the channel that talked about quad
cores being no good for gaming in my
opinion there really is a massive
difference in performance between
something like the AMD athlon x4 950
which we've sort of recently see make
its way to the retail channels along
with
Rison 3 1200 a huge difference between
those two particular quad cores and then
the rise in 3 1200 and something like
the core i5 7600 k those there's a
massive difference between those two
CPUs when it comes to gaming performance
and again they are all four core four
threaded CPUs so do gamers require six
to eight threads in 2017 well no I don't
believe they do and I've shown this
through extensive testing on the channel
already I'm also not basing this opinion
on a few thousand benchmark runs
conducted on a clean system I've
actually spent many many hours gaming on
the rise and three 1200 rig now and in
instances where I found it to actually
be quiet a week had nothing to do with
the core count coming from my core i7
7700 K gaming rig the horizon 3 CPU
really struggled with Starcraft 2 what's
the action got hectic in a 4 V 4 game to
be fair though even the 7700 K slows a
little but that's because the game
really only heavily taxes a single core
and that core needs to be clocked
extremely high and offer excellent IPC
performance my 77 arcade gaming system
also runs with the geforce gtx 1080 TI
at 1440p for playing with the r3 1200
I've been using a 1080p display with the
gtx 1064 the level of investment it's my
opinion of the experience on the Rison 3
1200 system with the gtx 1060 is
exceptional and for the most part i have
to admit it really isn't that noticeable
from my high-end gaming rig the 7700 k
is of course still a quad core but it
has hyper-threading support for 8
threads and my system has also been
overclocked to 4.9 gigahertz if you love
the Rison 3 1200 in with the geforce gtx
980ti then sure compared to the 7700
okay it doesn't look great that said at
no point is the experience bad it just
looks weak pushing a hundred and six FPS
and battlefield one opposed to 168 FPS
with the 7700 k so let's circle back to
the core i5 7600 k is it a bad gaming
cpu in late 2017 no certainly not at
least in my opinion as much as I like
the rise in CPUs the 72 enrique is
arguably the better cpu right now for
the vast majority of games out there you
can certainly find titles where the rise
and fire
1600 is faster and it could possibly end
up being the superior CPU down the track
but for now most DirectX 11 titles play
better on the quad-core okay so the 7600
K is still an impressive CPU in late
2017 but would I buy it now let's for a
moment pretend that the 8th generation
series isn't coming in a few weeks time
and with that we will get 6 core Core i5
CPUs so again let's pretend that the 76
Henry K is it from Intel in 2017
there will be no better CPU for 240
dollars u.s. so would I buy it
well again no I wouldn't buy it because
I'd get the rise in 5 1600 which is not
only cheaper but also supports
overclocking or more affordable
motherboards and it ships with a decent
cooler as important as all those things
are when it comes down to value the r5
1600 is every bit as fast as the Core i5
7600 ok when using the geforce gtx 1070
or perhaps even vega 56 how many of you
will actually spend more than $400 u.s.
on your graphics card anyway actually it
doesn't really matter because if you are
spending $500 plus on a graphics card
you're likely looking at a more
substantial cpu purchase anyway in a few
weeks time we will have the eighth
generation intel core series and with
that for the first time ever we will
have a four core 4 thread core i3 cpu
and because of that this debate will no
doubt fire up all over again and they'll
be those that claim that the core i3
8100 for example will be a bad buy
because it only has 4 threads yet we'll
find that if you pair the cpu with an
affordable graphics card then it's going
to deliver a similar experience to a cpu
that cost significantly more then we
have the upgraders debate it's no secret
that Intel's bright lines have stagnated
over the past 5 years or so and with no
competition from AMD until very recently
things have been slow to get moving if
quad cores are indeed dead in 2017 those
rocking a Sandy Bridge Ivy Bridge has
well or maybe even a Broadwell processor
are probably in desperate need of an
upgrade truth be told if you have a
locked Sandy Bridge or Ivy Bridge Core
i5 processor then upgrading to something
like the risin 5 1600 will often
noteworthy gains even with a mid-range
GPU
however if you're lucky enough to have
an unlocked Core i5 and you've
overclocked it to 4.5 gigahertz or
higher then the upgrade to the r5 1600
is more of a sidestep than a tangible
upgrade at this point in fact for the
older but still very popular titles such
as csgo the old unlocked quad cores are
likely going to be superior as these
games typically only utilize a single
thread for these kind of games you want
a high clock chip with strong IPC
performance much like what we saw in
Starcraft 2 so when picking your next
CPU you want to consider a good many
things how long do you plan on going
between upgrades
what kind of GPU will you be using and
can you see yourself getting an extreme
GPU in the future you know something
that costs four hundred dollars plus and
really just as importantly what other
games you'll be playing my advice is not
to get too hung up on the whole core
count thing a CPU with more cause isn't
necessarily better the one with less and
this is particularly true if they're of
different architectures the CPUs
architecture and operating frequency
really influences how many calls you
require for acceptable performance in
games though the games also have to be
able to utilize the amount of cores you
bring to the table as well so again it
comes back to the games you plan on
playing CPU utilization isn't always the
best indicator either I know people
always focus on this but it really isn't
we saw with the core i5 2500 K at its
stock clock speed it was pegged at 100%
in battlefield 1 and yet it provided a
much smoother and better experience than
say the FX 83-70 which only saw
utilization hovering around 70 to 80%
finally if you want to do something like
streaming then even a highly overclocked
7600 K might struggle and this is a
valid argument for picking up something
like the Rison v 1600 in the end it
really comes down to what you can afford
obviously the cheapest 4 core 8 thread
CPU from AMD is priced at 160 dollars
u.s. and well that is very reasonable
for what you get it's still not much
good to someone who can only afford $100
for a final hypothetical scenario if the
core i5 7600 K was priced alongside the
horizon v 1400 and that is to say it
cost 160 dollars u.s. then despite the
fact that it only has half as many
threads as the AMD CPU I would be
picking the core i5 every day
week as I've said all CPUs aren't
created equally and even in core heavy
games such as ashes of the singularity a
stock 7600 K beats an overclocked Rison
5 1400 doesn't however mean it's worth
spending 50% more on the core i5
processor because if you're pairing with
a mid-range graphics card there's really
going to be little to no difference
between the two well that's gonna do it
for this one let me know what you guys
