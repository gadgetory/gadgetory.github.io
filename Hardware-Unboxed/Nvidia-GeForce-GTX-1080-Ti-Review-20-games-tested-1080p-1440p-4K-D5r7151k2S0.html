you like me need a bit of a break for
the rising madness and I think I have
just the thing an insanely expensive
graphics card yep hey how's work a few
days ago I took the covers off in videos
new GeForce GTX 1080 TI founders edition
graphics card in an unboxing video I
covered most of the specifications in
that video so I won't go over any of
that stuff again here for more details
feel free to check out the written
version over at tech spot the link will
be included in the video description a
big part of this story other than the
fact that gamers can now get Pascal
tight necks like performance for $700 is
the new $500 MSRP for the original GT x
1080
as for the 1080 TI previously this level
of performance cost an eye watering
twelve hundred dollars us and knocking a
little over 40% off the price tag is no
small thing
since the GTX 1082 I won't be anything
radically new in terms of performance
especially if you have the Titan XP
added to the mix like I will there
really isn't any need to test twenty
games but this is Harbor on box so you
know anyway for those of you who just
want to check out the performance and a
few select games feel free to refer to
the video index which I will provide in
a pinned comment as well as a video
description for testing I will be using
my core i7 7700 K rig which will be
overclocked to 4.9 gigahertz a few
months ago I moved away from testing
stock or reference graphics cards for a
few reasons the main reason being that I
always suggest you guys avoid AMD and in
video reference cards and instead pick
up the quality board partner versions
with bigger coolers that allow the card
to run cooler quieter and boost more
reliably so then the only reference
cards included in the results that
you're about to see include the GTX 1080
Ti and the Titan XP as you can't get
custom Titan XP cards the rest of
factory overclocked board partner cards
and I'll the list which models were used
in the video description I recieved a
heap of requests to show 1080p results
and although it seems strange to me I'm
going to do it anyway since enough of
you guys asked that said I will quickly
gloss over the 1080p and 1440p results
and focus
mainly on the 4k numbers I have added
the fury X to the 4k testing but didn't
have time to include in the 1080p and
1440p results so hopefully you guys will
let that one slide there are 61 graphs
in total so beware of that it's a bit of
an information overload again feel free
to skip to the games that interest you
but if you like me NSYNC 20 games is a
good little start then let's get on with
it
those seeking extreme frame rates and
battlefield 1 will certainly receive
them at 1080p with v10 atti as it
matched the performance of the Titan XP
this was also the case at 1440p and here
in videos new flagship gaming graphics
card pushed well over 100 FPS at all
times
now the 4k resolution battlefield 1
looks as sharp as the edges of a generic
ATX case thankfully though the 1080 Ti
in charge of the rendering work it's a
painless experience here we see a smooth
73 FPS average while frame rates never
dipped below 66 FPS as expected this
again puts it roughly on par of the
Titan XP dropping just a few frames
behind testing with Far Cry primal at
1080p we run into a rather heavy CPU
bottleneck at 1080p how is it okay to
talk about CPU bottlenecks in this
review and I'm not quite sure about that
one so to confuse the sound boys who are
all rather that CPU bottlenecks at the
moment let's call it a CPU speed limit
instead yeah let's go off that at 1440p
the 1080 Ti again roughly matches the
Titan XP making at 21% faster than the
standard GTX 1080
not bad results given frame rate stayed
above 80 FPS at all times
moving to 4k the 1080 TI tiptoes ahead
of the Titan XP though it was just 2 fps
in it the performance is obviously very
similar again when compared to the
standard 1080 we are seeing 20% more
performance here even with the core i7
7700 K overclocked a four point ninety
goes we start to run into another one of
those pesky cpu speed limits this time
in Call of Duty infinite warfare at
1080p that's it when looking at the
minimum frame rate the 1080 - I still
produce 22% more performance than the
standard 1080 it also looked very mighty
at 1440p with an average of 117 FPS
while frame rates never dipped below a
hundred FPS at the extreme 4k resolution
frame rate stayed north of 60fps with
the 1080 - I pushing no less than 66 fps
throughout
test that made it 35% faster than the
vanilla 1080 when comparing the minimum
frame rate which is most impressive
civilization 6 is a rather CPU demanding
game and is therefore quite well known
for imposing CPU speed limits here we
see the 1080 1080 Ti and Titan XP capped
out at 85 fps moving to 1440p the
high-end GPUs are still performance
limited even at 4k we find the
higher-end GPUs all deliver very similar
results the good news here of course
being that all cards testers are capable
of delivering playable performance at
this extreme resolution debut 6 mankind
divided was tested using the very high
quality preset and here the 1080 TI spat
out 113 FPS on average making it a
fraction faster than the Titan XP moving
to 1440p it held the lead over the Titan
while providing a 23 percent greater
average frame rate when compared to the
original 1080 those wanting to play
mankind divided at 4k will likely have
to tweak a few settings as the 35 FPS
minimum isn't exactly desirable not when
spending this kind of money anyway in
any case at this resolution the 1080 - I
should be at least 25 percent faster
than the standard 1080 the division is
very demanding on the GPU as most games
are and here we see that even at 1080p
at 1080 Ti and tight and XP will still
dip below 80 FPS at times still with an
average of over 120 fps it goes without
saying that gameplay was extremely
smooth performance remains very strong
at 1440p with over 60 fps rendered at
all times here we have another game that
we require either two GPUs for a smooth
floor K experience or a reduction in
quality settings the 53 FPS average is
actually very good but at times frame
rates drop as low as 31 FPS in our test
doom enforces its own speed limit with a
200 FPS hard frame cap which we are
easily reaching on the high-end GPUs at
1080p
even at 1440p the 1080 TI and Titan XP
are locked at the 200 FPS frame cap
turning up the pixels at 4k we still see
well over 100 FPS at all times on the
Titan XP and GT X 1080 Ti as a result
this made at 24% faster than the
standard GT X 1080 for the average frame
rate and 20% faster for the minimum
those playing f1 2016 running triple
monitor simulator type setup
will no doubt be very interested in what
the gtx 980ti has to offer the 1080p
performance is impressive though it
looks as though we're being held back a
little bit here at 1440p 32 I starts to
pull further away from the standard
townie with an average of 133 fps now at
4k the 1080 Ti is good for 81 fps on
average while framerate stayed above 67
FPS at all times this then made in
videos news $700 chap 20% faster than
the GTX 1080 cutting your way through
hordes of stupidly easy baddies in
tirana is at least slightly satisfying
with the GTX 1082 I here at 1440p we see
over 80 fps and this will help you keep
up in the online mode as you change your
guard stance multiple times per second
now 4k using the extreme quality preset
we are still seeing a respectable 55 FPS
on average this then was a 22%
performance boost over the 45 fps
churned out by the original GTX 1080
those of you running 144 Hertz monitors
can take full advantage of all those
Hertz and Gears of War 4 at 1080 P using
the new GT X 1080 Ti even at 1440p frame
rates are often seen above 100 FPS
roughly double that of those pathetic
mid-range graphics cards I kid of course
now at 4k we see the fury acts and gtx
1070 struggling to keep pace while the
standard GT X 1080 looks quite
respectable the ti model provides an
additional 24 percent performance bump
hitting an average of 57 FPS for those
of you new to the channel I should point
out that in some games or certain tiles
that support DirectX 12 I test in video
using DirectX 11 and AMD using DirectX
12 I have discussed why this is in the
past so I won't go over that again
basically AMD performs better using
DirectX 12 and in video using DirectX 11
there is no reason for g4 DonorsChoose
DX 12 in a game that sends performance
backwards for no reason so essentially
I'm testing the API that gamers will
actually use
so using dx11 the gtx 1080i spits out a
hundred and thirty FPS on average making
in a fraction faster than the titan XP
moving to 1440p the TI was good for 120
FPS on average and we are starting to
move away from that tricky cpu speed
limit here now at 4k the average frame
rate is reduced to 74 FPS with a minimum
64 FPS and once again the GTX 1080 TI
performs very similar to the Titan XP
just a whisker slower this also meant it
was 29% fast and the GTX 1080 using the
high quality preset the 1080 - I pushed
an average of 101 FPS at 1080p and Mafia
3 which isn't bad though that's not much
faster than the standard GTX 1080
moving to 1440p the TI starts to pull
away from the plain-jane 1080 though it
is only 13 percent faster here finally
at 4k the 1080 TI it's full stride
pulling further away from the standard
1080 by a massive 29% margin next up we
have the game that made parkour cool and
not the other way around
helped me to keep up to speed and
jumping over or underneath things at
maximum efficiency is the GTX 1080 - our
they blistering fast 150 FPS on average
even at 1440p frame rates average over
100 FPS another nod then for high
refresh rate gaming even at the 4k
resolution using the ultra quality
preset button 82 I averaged 57 fps
making it 24 percent faster than the GTX
1080 you probably don't need a GTX 1080
TI to play overwatch but it would be
pretty darn cool to have one anyway
frame rates are pretty insane at 1080p
and even at 1440p we see an average
frame rate of around 250 FPS that said
this is a very CPU intensive game and
our bots test hammers even the core i7
77 or okay overclocked to 4.9 gigahertz
quite hard at 4k the massive variance
between the average and minimum frame
rate is now gone and we're primarily GPU
bound at this point in other words your
typical 4k GPU speed limit has been
applied here firing up quantum break we
said the GTX 1082 a is able to match the
Titan XP as expected what's interesting
here is how much faster it is in the
standard 10a even at 1080p 22 percent
more performance this resolution is
quite surprising
moving to 1440p the margin is extended
ever so slightly to 23% and again the TA
is still pushing over 100 FPS finally
the 4k resolution the 1080 Ti is good
for almost 60 FPS on average using the
ultra quality preset that again made it
23% faster than the standard 1080
playing Resident Evil 7 with the 1080i
we see and
double 211 FPS on average at 1080p with
the quality settings maxed out that's
more than twice the average framerate of
the rx 480 and gtx 1060 graphics cards
similar margins are seen at 1440p and
again frame rates are kept well above
100 FPS on in videos new $700 graphics
curb Resident Evil 7 looks amazing on a
large 4k screen and a single 1080 - I
can handle the rendering work no worries
as gameplay with silky smooth at 60fps
at all times as a result we saw 24% more
frames from the ti when compared to the
standard 1080 rise of the Tomb Raider
blew us away with amazing visuals over a
year ago now but even today the game is
still one of the more impressive looking
titles although we don't test a terribly
demanding section of the game the 1080i
still looks mighty impressive in
relation to the gtx 1070 for example
moving to 1440p we see that it's 23%
faster than the GTX 1080 and incredibly
55 percent faster than the gtx 1070
which as we know is roughly as fast as
last season's maxwell based titan x -
mereta is another game that looks
absolutely stunning on a big 4k screen
and the fact that 1080 TI overages 77
FPS e means that with a single graphics
card you can fully enjoy the experience
here it was 28% faster than the GTX 1080
titanfall 2 is a seriously fast paced
first-person shooter so this is a game
it would be popular with 144 Hertz
owners coincidentally the 1080 TI
averaged exactly 144 FPS at 1080p with
the quality settings maxed out even at
1440p we're still seeing an average of
120 FPS with the 1080 TOI now it's all
ok the average framerate has been
heavily reduced as you would expect
still we are seeing an average of 72 FPS
here though this is just 10% faster than
the standard 1080 total war Warhammer is
a game that I really feel should be
played using the dx12 API regardless of
whether you're running AMD or Nvidia
Hardware like ashes in a single area
during the battles when there are masses
of Units on the screen the CPU takes a
good old pounding when using dx11
anyway even on DX 12 the GTX 1080 Ti is
still mighty fast pushing over 100 FPS
at all times at 1080p at 1440p frame
rates are again very strong and we often
saw a frame rates exceeding 100 FP
now finally at 4k the average frame rate
has been heavily reduced as you would
expect still with an average of 65 fps
it was an impressive 30% faster than the
standard 1080 finally watchdogs - this
is the last game I've tested I promise
despite being a hugely demanding game on
system resources
aka unoptimized the GTX 1082 I still
manages to reach 100 FPS on average
even at 1440p frame rates remain high
and in videos new GPU is still good for
91 FPS allowing it to match the Titan XP
moving to 4k the tanita is still 23%
faster than the original 1080 as it went
on to reach an average of 59 FPS when
compared to the GTX 1080 the 1080 TI
consumes just 7% more power pushing the
total system consumption of 334 watts
which is surprisingly low keep in mind
we are using a custom board partner
version for the GTX 10 80 gigabytes g1
gaming but even then that's an
impressive results for the 1080 TI that
also means it's using less power than
the fury acts despite delivering
considerably more performance
interestingly though when compared to
the Titan XP the 1080 TI reduced total
system consumption by 8% which is more
than I expected to see now I wouldn't
say in videos gtx 1080 TI foundered
edition graphics card is loud when
gaming but you can certainly hear it
over your case fans under load the fam
round at 50% capacity which sees it
spinning at 2400 rpm the thing pumps out
some serious heat as well load temps
quickly reached 80 degrees before maxing
out at 84 degrees at this temperature
the card would hold an operating
frequency of at least 16 hundred and 70
megahertz please do note that when I
unboxed the gtx 980ti a few days ago i
did remove the cooler and wipe the
thermal paste off to show you guys the
dye the paste was replaced with
something that looked quite similar
though there's no guarantee that
wouldn't impact thermals one way or the
other as it turns out I don't think this
influenced the results too much Kevin
over at Tech showdown confirmed
operating temperatures of around 83
degrees well if you came on that 20 game
benchmark journey with me didn't skip
ahead at any point and sat through all
the benchmarks then I guess it's safe to
say you're having a pretty slow day
anyway I enjoyed checking out those
and I hope you did too before we wrap
things up let's just summarize how the
gtx 1080i fared against the standard
1080 as well as the fury ax for those of
you who didn't have time to sit through
all twenty games when compared to the
original gtx 980 or the g1 gaming model
that we use for testing which was
released almost a year ago now the new
ti model was on average 22% faster we
did see it deliver up to 30% more
performance in title such as Deus Ex
mankind divided and total war Warhammer
that said it for Kahler gains with
sometimes as little as 10% still for the
most part as that average figure
suggests the 1080i delivered between 20
and 25% more performance that said it
does come in at around 40% more
expensive in the GTX 1080
but of course that's the premium you pay
for high-end gaming and with no
alternative there's no need for in video
to be more aggressive on pricing at
least for now anyway the fury X is just
about eligible for the pension at this
point as it's just a few months off at
second birthday two years is a long time
this is top of your product stack as the
flagship offering anyway the gtx 1080i
puts the fury X down in the most humane
way possible quickly dispatching of it
with 61% more performance on average as
a side note I believe what we're seeing
here is the fury X running into a VRAM
capacity issue at 4k in Doom and that's
why it gets pantsed in a game where you
would expect it to do significantly
better than it did as noted in a video I
created about a month ago unless you can
pick up a fury X graphics card for $300
u.s. or less I wouldn't bother at that
price of 1080p is obviously more than
twice as expensive and it's not twice as
fast that said it's really GPU such as
the gtx 1070 that make the fury XR bad
buy at over $300 so those of you
wondering I will be putting together an
in-depth overclock benchmarking video
soon I didn't really have time to cover
that here or more I didn't want to
stretch the video out any longer than I
have and I figured overclocking is
usually best in its own video but I
don't expect much out of the founders
edition card anyway I'm guessing will
squeeze maybe 10% more performance out
as we are running pretty close as it is
out of the box to that 91 degree
threshold
I imagine overclocking will be a lot
better or at least better
on a custom board partner card featuring
a nice big cooler something like what
gigabyte will produce about horas
product line it's really the board
partner cards that will make the GTX 10
attr truly exciting in my opinion
pricing aside the Titan XP is a
seriously nice graphics card
well nice GPU as the graphics card only
comes with the reference cooler which
runs extremely hot too hot to handle
after a short gaming session and for me
that kind of spoiled it obviously we
need not worry about the Titan XP
anymore as the GTX 1080 tier offers the
same kind of performance while shaving a
little over 40% off the asking price
right now the 1080 Ti is the ultimate 4k
gaming solution or really just the
ultimate gaming solution as 1440p 144
Hertz gamers will also be chomping at
the bit to get their hands on one until
AMD releases Vega I really don't expect
to see any kind of shift in the GPU
landscape still knocking the vanilla GT
X 1080 down to $500 us from the original
600 WS asking price is a huge win for
consumers for us Aziza is now possible
to purchase the GTX eternity locally for
just $700 AUD
I suspect in video has done this to
create a huge buzz around their high-end
parts they really enjoyed strong sales
and profits in 2016 thanks to the GTX
1080 and 1070 or well the whole Pascal
lineup really if I'm honest I imagine
they are trying to recapture that magic
once the end in 2017 and I see no better
way of doing that than cutting the GTX
1080 down to $500 and then bringing in a
really impressive part like they have
with the TI or the 1080 TI at $700 and
this will probably help take away a bit
of attention from AMD's upcoming Vega
anyway the GTX 1080 g5 is mighty
expensive at $700
know what sorry what was my note right
I'm talking about the price
mighty expensive at $700 and I'm not
going to deny that is a very expensive
graphics card at the same time it's also
delivering performance that we've really
has been unheard of at this price you
can't get anything else at delivers
nearly the same level of performance for
$700 so Nvidia will certainly get away
with charge
that price and I imagine as this video
goes live there'll be people somewhere
in the world lining up to get their
hands on one of these for the equivalent
of $700 u.s.
speaking of which locally when you guys
or the Australians wake up on Friday
morning and head down to their favorite
retailer to try and pick one of these up
the rumor is you will be stung around
$1200 AUD which is quite a bit above the
straight conversion from US dollars to
Aussie dollars
so yeah we're getting stung quite a
price premium on top of the price
premium for this card but it is suggest
that you'll probably go to land one for
about $1,000 AUD
from Amazon or new egg so keep that in
mind bit sad that we can buy it so much
cheaper after having paid shipping from
the US ourselves and you're that kind of
may have problems with warranty if you
need to warranty the card down the trap
anyway that's what it is
we had $700 I still think it is a great
value product for high end extreme
gaming for now I'm King to get my hands
on a custom GTX 10 atti graphics card
because you I think they're going to be
a lot more impressive as they often are
bigger coolers and whatnot so yeah I'll
be grabbing one of them as soon as
possible hopefully in a week or two and
bringing you a review as quick as I can
get that together so with that I'm going
to go harass my contacts now I'm your
host Steve hope to catch you again soon
