corner been a few weeks since we run the
segment on the channel but we're back
we're ready to resume a normal Friday
coverage of whatever news topics
appeared throughout the week it does
seem like we're in a bit of a lull
period between the RTX launch and a few
upcoming launches for the Korra 999
hundred K and RT X 2070 but there's
still a couple of interesting things to
discuss quick update on RT X 28 e TI
availability as you know Nvidia delayed
the 28 et I watched from its original
September 20th launch date to September
27th and then again to early October
well the good news is cards bought
through Nvidia comm with a September
ship date will all ship by October 5th
which is today and then those with an
October ship date will see them shipped
by October 10th so shouldn't be too long
until those cards arrive it does seem
like Nvidia is struggling with 28 e TI
stock most board partner cards are also
out of stock at major retail as well
it's relatively easy to get an RT x 28 e
no surprises for why that might be in
videos latest blog post says that supply
chain updates have been resolved so
hopefully there's a few more 28 et eyes
in the market soon AMD will be hosting
their first ever keynote address at CES
2019 in Las Vegas with CEO Lisa suit set
to take the stage to talk about seven
nanometer CPUs and GPUs the keynote will
be held on January 9 which is the first
official day of the show but it won't be
the prime opening keynote that slot is
yet to be announced in was filled last
year by Intel and then before that
Microsoft for a number of years however
the fact that AMD is hosting a keynote
at all is big news for the company which
is historically used lower key events to
launch products
20:19 those said to be a big one for AMD
as they involved their seven nanometer
consumer portfolio including Xen 2 based
products that are expected to form the
Rison 3000 series and of course na'vi
based GPUs and b have explicitly stated
that the keynote will be used to discuss
high performance 7 nanometre CPUs and
GPUs so we can pretty much expect to see
launch of these products on stage at CES
of course
doesn't necessarily mean that the
products will hit store shelves soon
after we still expect third generation
to become available around the same time
as rising in the past few years that's
to say in March or April new graphics
cards could take a little longer than
knowing AMD's past releases where
they've teased details well ahead of
general availability still 2019 should
be very exciting for AMD especially on
the GPU side where we should hopefully
see some proper competition for
invidious high-end products as reported
by moe moe moe via video cards potential
core I $9.99 hundred K packaging has
leaked through an Amazon listing the
listing shows a dodecahedron box with
translucent panels which certainly is
quite strange but more in line with what
AMD you're doing these days with their
thread river packaging you can also see
specs like 8 core 16 threads up to 500
gigahertz clock speeds and a $582 50
price though who knows if that price is
correct the packaging looks a little too
strange to be a fake we did spot one
growing issue and that's the perspective
of the core i9 logo if the upper
pentagonal face isn't flat relative to
the camera yet decor and own logo
doesn't seem to match that perspective
but we have seen a higher resolution
photo of the box from a different angle
and looks pretty real to me so I suspect
this is what we'll see on launch day in
more legitimate news I guess late last
week Intel DIF confirm they're under
pressure with the capacity of their 14
nanometer production facilities the
company is prioritizing the production
of high performance Xeon and core
processors at these facilities while
also increasing the investment in fabs
by 1 billion dollars to boost 14
nanometer production at their various
firms around the globe it's also
provided an update on 10 nanometers
saying that yields are improving and
they expect volume production in 2019
though who knows where the Intel Estonia
truth with that one considering their
track record Microsoft and NVIDIA have
begun the process of readying pcs for
ray-tracing so we might finally be able
to test that soon and see what it's like
a couple of days ago Microsoft began
rolling out the Windows 10 October 2018
update version 1809 which updates Direct
X to support dxr or DirectX ray-tracing
a key API that's needed to support ray
tracing in DirectX games we also get a
few other things like better HDR
management a dark mode for Explorer and
a new
version of WDDM nvidia also released a
new driver for their GeForce graphics
cards version for 1616 which brings
official support for the Windows 10
October 2018 update and game ready
support for DX are interesting to say
this game really support for DX our
window games have ray-tracing just yet
but whatever there's also a few new sli
profiles for games like Battlefield 5
and divinity original sin - we'll keep
you posted on when games have been
updated to include rate racing but now
it's actually possible thanks to
Microsoft's update the Wi-Fi Alliance
has renamed and simplified the names of
their Wi-Fi standards Wi-Fi attitude at
11a C for example becomes simply Wi-Fi 5
which makes it much easier to identify
how what is the latest standard attitude
11 n becomes Wi-Fi 4 and the upcoming
Aero 2.11 a X becomes Wi-Fi 6 this joins
other communication protocols like
Bluetooth that use simple numbered
naming schemes which are so much benefit
consumers than stuff like AC and ax
which make pretty much no sense if you
don't aren't really familiar with the
the Wi-Fi naming schemes this new will
be different versions of Wi-Fi 5 in
different peak throughputs depending on
the Maya and tenor configuration now
account balance and so on so not
everything about a Wi-Fi implementation
is met obvious through the number but
it's definitely a step in the right
direction
couple of laptop announcements to close
this one out alien where are finally
getting into the slim gaming laptop
market with the m15 their thinnest
machine yet this new 15-inch machine
isn't the smallest I've seen but it's a
massive step forward for the company
that traditionally makes the biggest
heaviest chunkier slap from so you can
find the hardware were looking at a core
i7 87 58 GTX 10 60 or 1070 max Q and a
1080p 144 Hertz display as some of the
typical specs that there are higher and
lower end models that use different CPUs
displays and storage configurations the
base model will be available for
thirteen hundred US dollars and will be
available on October 25th microsoft also
refreshed their surface line up with a
new surface pro 6 surface laptop and
surface studio the pro 6 uses a new 8th
gen cpu from Intel and comes in a new
matte black color while the surface
laptop also receives
8th gen quad-core CPUs and the new
hello the pro six will set you back at
least $900 and the laptop at least one
thousand US dollars with auto shipping
on October 16th the studio while that's
still costs a whopping three thousand
five hundred dollars to start with the
partner uses a faster core i7 7820 HQ
processor with up to GTX 1070 graphics
with an updated and still excellent 28
inch 4500 by 3000 display with pen
support not quite sure why they didn't
use an 8th gen processor there they're
still going with the quad core 7820 HQ
but maybe there's some thermal reasons
for that that's it for this week's news
