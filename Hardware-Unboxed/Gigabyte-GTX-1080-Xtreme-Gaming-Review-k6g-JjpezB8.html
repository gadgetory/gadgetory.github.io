game with GT X 1080 Phoenix goes like
hell edition and if wasn't obvious
I very much like game words take on the
geforce gtx 1080 the cards operating
temps were impressively low just 68
degrees on the full load well it never
exceeded 73 degrees when overclocked all
while remaining very quiet the
overclocking performance is also very
good delivering my best results to date
overall the big bulky cooler and
redesigned PCB got the job done going
back two weeks i checked out the
gigabyte GT x 1080 g1 gaming this was a
decent offering from gigabyte though was
only marginally better than the founders
edition card in my opinion gigabyte are
clearly targeting the $600 MSRP with
that model and currently pricing is
around the 650 us or 1150 au mark now
taking things to the next level is
gigabytes GT X 1080 extreme gaming model
which commands a seven hundred US dollar
or 1250 Australian dollar price tag for
the gaming Premium Pack which is virtual
reality ready so what makes the extreme
gaming model worthy of the name and more
importantly the price premium in short
pretty much everything has been upgraded
over the g1 gaming model out of the box
the extreme gaming operates at higher
clock speeds the extreme gaming delivers
a base clock of 1670 megahertz and a
boost clock of 1873 megahertz in gaming
mode and up to 1898 megahertz in OC mode
this is a step up from the g1 gaming
boost clock speed of 1784 megahertz in
gaming mode in 1822 megahertz in OC mode
on top of the PCB the extreme gaming
features a new second generation triple
slot triple fan cooler using gigabytes
windforce 3x design this patent-pending
design is able to accommodate three huge
100 millimetre fans without stretching
the card length beyond 300 millimeters
as you might expect three fans of that
size to do gigabyte has achieved this
space-saving feat by overlapping the
fans normally this will create a lot of
turbulence which could reduce cooling
performance and more importantly
generate quite a bit of noise this has
been circumvented by using a can of
rotating center fan cube I says this
provides up to 10% more airflow than
conventional triple fan coolers and
that's the power of wind force people
the fans feature double ball bearing
to ensure the extreme gaming goes the
distance the 3d active fan feature
enables silent semi passive fans
allowing gamers to enjoy gameplay in
absolute silence when the system is
running light or at idle an LED fans
stop indicator provides a user-friendly
instant display of the fan status adding
a bit of bling to this cooler is of
course the RGB lighting the LED powered
exlude nate's on the center of the
shroud while there's another LED powered
extreme gaming logo on the side creating
an awesome effect for those with case
windows ads for the extreme gaming is
length and measures two hundred and
eighty nine millimeters long which is
specially the same length of the game
wood Phoenix GLH model in fact it's just
four millimeters longer the extreme
gaming is noticeably heavier though and
there's a good reason for this removing
the cooler reveals a massive copper base
that covers not just the GPU but also
the gddr5 X memory chips there's also
six very long six millimeter copper heat
pipes snaking their way through the two
large arrays of aluminium fins removing
the cooler also exposes the PCB and what
we have here is a completely reworked
masterpiece
the measure is 267 millimeters long and
121 millimeters tall for the extreme
gaming model gigabyte has employed a 12
plus to power phase design which should
allow the extreme gaming to work at a
lower temperature and provide more
stable voltage output both of which
should improve overclocking and extend
the life of the card gigabyte also
claimed to be using Titan next grade
chokes and capacitors for greater
durability another cool feature is the
aerospace-grade PCB coding which
gigabyte claims protects the graphics
card and all its vital components from
dust insects drop screws drill shavings
and abrasion probably more useful for
power users of the moisture resistant
properties which is said to prevent
unwanted conduction paths that
ultimately lead to board failure now I
would want to test this feature but it
could be a handy insurance measure just
in case your water cooling system
springs a leak the cars also backed by
extreme care four year warranty although
it isn't entirely clear the warranty
covers water damage finally as an added
layer of protection gigabyte has covered
the rear of the PCB and a large
attractive backplate moving on we find
jewel 8 p-m PCI Express power connectors
capable of feeding the extreme gaming
graphics card up to 300 watts that's
twice the PCIe power input of the
founders decision card
finally at the end of the PCB there are
two internal HDMI connectors which
connect to the extreme violent module
provided in the premium pack this link
module also features a pair of easy to
access USB 3 ports which will be handy
for connecting controllers in the
whatnot along with the extreme viale
module the premium pack also includes an
extreme VR link extended bracket XMP 300
mousepad wrist protector PCIe power
cable adapter an extreme gaming sticker
and a custom design high bandwidth sli
bridge that matches the extreme gaming
graphics card those of you wanting to
overclock the gtx 1080 extreme gaming
can turn to gigabyte so an extreme
engine software which i found very
useful when testing the g1 gaming model
the software enables easy overclocking
and allows the user to increase the
thermal target as well as the power
target the user can monitor the GPUs
vitals and easy overclocking modes exist
along with the more complex manual
overclocking options voltage states can
be adjusted and custom fan curves can
also be created finally the
all-important
RGB lighting can be configured here and
there's a few of the more standard
effects to play with when it came to
overclocking were able to increase the
memory speed by 612 megahertz resulting
in total frequency of 5400 megahertz
the core was pushed to a base clock of
1839 megahertz with a boost clock speed
of 1978 megahertz of course due to
Nvidia is GPU boost 3.0 we know the card
can run faster than the suggester boost
clock if kept under the thermal and
power targets in the case of the extreme
gaming disallowed the card to hold an
operating frequency of 2.1 gigahertz
after a 20-minute stress test which was
most impressive so why don't we jump
into the benchmarks and see how the
extreme gaming got on them first on the
testing agenda is battlefield 4 with the
overclocked nad extreme gaming topped
our charts with 124 fps this was 6 more
frames than its out-of-the-box
configuration which was a negligible
single frame behind our previously
tested game word goes like hell edition
compared to gigabytes other g1 gaming
card and the founders edition 1080 the
extreme gaming was good for an
additional 8 frames per second the card
rankings at 4k were quite similar to
1440p with the overclocked extreme
gaming card proving to be our fastest
single card tested with 63 fps in a
standard config it was again
neck-and-neck with its board partner
rival for game wood and was 3 FPS better
than the founders edition
our next game tested was Far Cry primal
we're again at 1080 variants all fell
within a few frames of each other
overclocking gave only a small four
frame boost here and was required to get
just 2 FPS ahead of our overclocked fans
edition card at 88 FPS with a minimum of
73 gamers can enjoy a super smooth
experience at this resolution with
everything maxed out now at 4k the
overclocked extreme game was slowed 247
FPS in this demanding triple-a title
this overclocked only netted us an extra
2 FPS which starts to sound a little
insignificant but the extra 3 FPS tacked
on to the minimum is definitely welcome
at these lowest frame rates in Star Wars
Battlefront the extreme gaming card
pumped out a healthy 104 frames per
second just 2 more than its g1 gaming
little brother overclocked it was able
to increase this margin to 8 FPS with
110 FPS on average at 4k the overclocked
extreme gaming card was close to 60 FPS
with 58 on average and a nearby minimum
of 53 FPS out of the box it was also
good for 55 FPS and a nice minimum of 49
which was level with the overclocked
founders Edition next up was the
division where a 1440p you can count on
eighty-three FPS on average if you
choose to overclock then you can expect
an extra 5 FPS for an average of 88
which is 3 more than your overclocked
founders Edition card now at 4k the
extreme gaming card managed a 50 FPS
average at its max overclock the
standard clock card gave us 47 FPS which
was the same as the GL h card and the
overclocked founders edition in the new
doom title of the 10 a DS crushed it and
the extreme gaming card crushes at the
hardest here pumped out a massive 140
FPS with a minimum of 114 if you're an
overclocker then you can expect an even
bigger 150 FPS average and a minimum of
121
now at 4k the 10 80s were brought back
down to earth for a still buttery smooth
72 FPS for the minimum of 58 our last
game tester was ARMA 3 and here
overclocking netted a nice little gain
of 5 fps putting a 3 FPS ahead of the
overclocked fans Edition card
there wasn't much fluctuation either
with the minimum frame rate within 5 FPS
of the average 4k just about hard our
frame rates with the extreme gaming
reduced to 43 FPS on average and a
minimum of 39 in the past I found
gigabyte are often quite aggressive with
their power profiles and it would seem
this is true for the extreme gaming card
as well out of the box the car consumes
1
97 watts 31 watts more than the founders
edition card once overclocked using the
maximum voltage Headroom the gigabyte
extreme engine software would allow the
total system consumption increased at
322 watts 56 Watts above the stock
founders edition card now this is where
the extreme gaming really impressed the
operating temperatures that massive
hietzing proved invaluable here allowing
the card to operate adjust 67 degrees
under full load and it's out-of-the-box
configuration keep in mind this was in a
temperature-controlled room maintaining
a 21 degree ambient air temp so that's a
6 degree improvement over the already
impressive g1 gaming it's also worth
noting that the fans were operating at
just 1200 rpm used me auto fan profile
so the card was almost silent when
overclocked the operating temperatures
increased by just one degree though the
fans did spin up to a barely audible
1600 rpm to be honest I was a little
disappointed coming off my gigabyte GT X
1080 g1 gaming review a few weeks ago
granted a lot of that had to do with the
sudden realization that the GTX 1080
overclocks like rubbish at least
compared to what was rumored that
initial disappointment though was
brought on by what turned out to be
unrealistic expectations once I move
past that it was clear the g1 game was a
great product given the out-of-the-box
performance and the fact that it cost
less than the founders edition card
following that I was very impressed with
the game with GT X 1080 Phoenix GL aged
so the bar been set and this graphics
card exceeded it in terms of performance
the gigabyte GT X 1080 extreme gaming
matches what we saw from the Phoenix GLH
the out of the box performance
overclocking Headroom and cooling
performance very similar though the
extreme gaming does appear to have a
slight advantage although looks are
subjective I also feel the extreme
gaming is the better looking product
there's probably the best-looking GD X
1080 on the market right now not only
that but the coolers are beast the 3 100
millimeter fans work like a charm and
it's loaded with more copper than my hot
water service the PCB design and
features are about as good as it gets
and the premium pack that I picked up
has some very worthwhile goodies inside
particularly if you plan to do a little
vr gaming the current $700 asking price
isn't that extreme either at least
relative to other GT X 1080 graphics
cards once availability improves this
package could become a little cheaper as
well so if you're after an aggressive
looking GTX 1080
with a mostly black color scheme capable
cool fancy RGB lighting and heavily
upgraded PCB then the extreme gaming is
for you does this take the current cake
is the best GTX 1080 let me know what
