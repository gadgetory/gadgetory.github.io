view is the first part of investigation
into game streaming a topic that a lot
of you guys request us to cover in our
CPU reviews but we tend to leave out
because it's quite complex to explore
all the nitty-gritty details of
streaming along with you know everything
else in those reviews but over a couple
of videos in the next few weeks we're
going to look into streaming and provide
you with a definitive answer on what
sort of setup is the best for game
streaming and what quality settings make
the most sense to use today's video is
mostly focused on streaming quality
settings we want to find out what
encoding settings deliver the best
balance between quality and performance
and how each of the various popular
encoding modes differs in terms of
results so a bit of backstory on our
test platform before we get into the
results one of the key things you want
to figure out first is where the
software encoding on the CPU or hardware
accelerated encoding on the GPU is the
better approach this is really one of
the key battles because if GPU encoding
is the way to go what CPU you need for
streaming becomes largely irrelevant
whereas if CPU encoding is better
naturally your choice of CPU becomes a
major factor in the level of quality not
just in terms of consistency of
streaming but game performance on your
end over the last few months in
particular GPU encoding has become more
interesting because Nvidia updated their
hardware encoding engine in their new
GPU architecture churring while a lot of
the focus went into improving a GBC
compatibility and performance which
isn't really relevant for game streaming
at the moment Turing's new engine is
also supposed to bring 15% better h.264
quality compared to the older engine in
pascal so that's something we'll look
into and see how turing stacks up
against x264 software encoding on the
GPU side we'll be using the RT x 2084
turing encoding a tight next pascal 4
pascal encoding and we'll also see how
AMD stacks up with vega 64 the second
part of the investigation involves
software encoding with x264 using a
variety of presets we're going to leave
a cpu comparison with software encoding
to a separate video in this video we're
more interested in how each preset
impacts before
and Kali all testing in this video was
done with the core i7 8700 K overclocked
to 4.9 gigahertz and 16 gigabytes of
ddr4 3000 memory which is our current
recommended platform for high-end gaming
in the future video we'll see how the
9900 K fares along with AMD's rice and
CPUs for capturing this footage we're
using the latest version of OBS and it's
set to record at 1080p 60fps with a
constant bitrate of 6000 kilobits per
second these are the maximum recommended
quality settings for twitch if you were
just recording gameplay for other
purposes would recommend using a higher
bitrate but for streaming to twitch
you'll need to keep it to 6 megabits per
second or lower unless you're a partner
we're testing the two games here we have
Assassin's Creed Odyssey which is a
highly demanding game on both the CPU
and GPU something that CPU encoding
struggles with and what's our horizon 4
which is less CPU demanding but a
fast-paced title that low bitrate
encoding can have issues with both
titles present a bit of a worst case
scenario for game streaming but in
different and unique ways we'll start
with GPU encoding because this is
something that has been known to be
rather terrible for a long time now the
key bit of interest is to see how truing
has managed to improve things compared
to past GPU encoding offerings which
were pretty much unusable next to CPU
encoding options for Nvidia cards we use
the env ink option in OBS and set it to
use the high quality preset at 6
megabits per second there are a few
other preset options but high quality
produces as the name suggests the
highest quality output for ambe's Vegas
64 we tried a range of encoding options
both in terms of preset and bitrate with
that much luck as you'll see in the
comparisons shortly putting truing and
Pascal's envying implementations
side-by-side there's honestly not that
much of a difference at 6 megabits per
second both suffer from serious macro
blocking effects and in general there is
I guess a complete lack of detail to the
image in photon horizon for in
particular blocking is very noticeable
on the road and looks terrible truing
this encoder is perhaps a little sharper
in some situations and is less blocky
but really both a garbage and if you
want to stream games this isn't the sort
of quality that will impress your
viewers AMD's encoder is even worse in
that when your GPU utilization is up
near 100% the encoder
completely craps and stacks and can't
render more than about one frame per
second which wasn't an issue with the
Nvidia cards I was able to get the
encoded working with a frame limiter
enabled which brought GPU utilization
down to around 60% in ports horizon 4
but even with the quality encoding
preset the quality Vegas 64 produced was
worse than with even invidious Pascal
cards with AMD's encoder out of the
question right from the beginning let's
have a look now at how in videos env Inc
compares to software X to 64 encoded on
the CPU in the slow-moving assassin's
creed Odyssey benchmark env ink even
using the high quality preset is
noticeably worse than x264 very fast
preset particularly for fine detail even
when both are limited to just 6 megabits
per second very fast x264 isn't amazing
by any stretch but the level of blocking
and the lack of detail to Turing's
envying implementation is well it's
terrible in comparison in the
faster-moving forza horizon for
benchmark Turing's and being does
outperform x264 very fast in some areas
envy ink again probably has slightly
worse blocking but very fast really
struggles with moving fine detail with
this level of motion env ink is
approximately equal to x2 64th faster
preset there is no doubt however the
x264 is fast preset is significantly
better than env ink in fast motion and
completely smokes it when there is slow
or little motion this was also perhaps a
little surprising considering Nvidia
claims there nuturing envying engine for
h.264 encoding is around the mark of
x264 fast encoding or even slightly
better at 6000 kilobits per second for
1080p 60fps streaming but from what I
observed especially in Assassin's Creed
Odyssey software encoding was much
better when looking purely at software
x264 encoding presets there are
noticeable differences between each of
very fast faster fast and medium in the
slower moving assassin's creed Odyssey
and ignoring the clear performance
issues with some presets for now very
fast and faster don't deliver a great
level of quality with a lot of smearing
blocking in some areas and a lack of
fine detail particularly for objects in
motion these two presets really
to be reserved just for those who want
to stream casually because the
presentation when capture 6 megabits
isn't great the fast preset is the
minimum I'd consider using for a quality
game stream particularly if you value
image quality for your viewers it
provides a noticeable quality job over
faster to the point where blurred fine
detail now has definition medium is a
noticeable improvement again but the gap
between fast and medium is smaller than
the gap between faster and fast and as
we'll see in a moment good luck using
the medium preset on the same system the
game is running on I did also check out
the slow preset but at this point we're
into diminishing returns for a massive
performance hit for faster motion in
Forza horizon 4 again I'd completely
dismissed the very fast preset
immediately because it's worse than envy
Inc for this type of content
unfortunately the tight bitrate limit of
6000 kilobits per second prevents any
preset from doing true justice to the
source material but once again medium
gets the closest and provides an
improvement over fast
the faster preset looks terrible so
again I'd suggest fast as the absolute
bare minimum for this type of content
really I'd recommend a medium at a
higher bitrate but hey twitch has set
the limit to 6 megabits so it's
basically the best we can do of course
image quality is only one part of the
equation the other is performance and
when you're streaming your gameplay from
the very same computer you're playing on
it's important that both your gameplay
experience and the performance of the
stream are adequate we'll start here by
looking at GPU encoding and see how that
affects performance enabling either
pascal or cheering's envy ink engine
affects the framerate of the game by
around 10 to 20 percent depending on the
game in other words you see a 10 to 20%
drop in framerate when comparing
capturing footage using envying to not
capturing the game at all the more GPU
limit of the game is the more of an
impact envy ink will have which is why
thoughts of horizon 4 is impacted more
heavily than the heavy CPU user in
Assassin's Creed Odyssey
the good news though is while you'll be
running the game at a lower frame rate
with envy ink the stream itself will
have perfect performance with no dropped
frames even if the game is using a
hundred percent of the GPU AMD's
encoding engine doesn't impact the
game's framerate nearly as much but it
drops about 90% of the frames when the
GPU is being heavily used making it
completely useless as we are
discussed earlier software encoding
performance depends on the type of game
you're playing in the case of Assassin's
Creed Odyssey which heavily utilizes
both the CPU and GPU streaming using the
CPU will have a noticeable effect on
framerate and high quality encoding
presets will struggle to keep up with
the core i7 8700 K and the RT X 2080
playing Odyssey using our custom
hardware and boxed quality preset we
were only able to encode the game using
the x264 very fast preset without
suffering from frame drops in the stream
output x264 very fast encoding also
reduces the framerate of the game by 17%
which was a larger reduction than simply
using env ink very fast encoding is
better visually than envying for this
type of game so the performance head in
I guess some sense is worth it however
moving to even the faster preset
introduces frame drops into the stream
output with a frame drop rate of 8.5%
the Apple is stuttering and hard to
watch meanwhile game performance has
dropped from 90 FPS on average to just
63 fps with the 1% low only just above
30 fps it's clear this preset is choking
the system and it gets worse with the
fast and medium process which seep frame
drop rates of 62 and 82% respectively
interestingly game performance is
slightly better with these presets than
with faster but I suspect that student
being coda being overwhelmed which
allows the game to get a small amount
more CPU Headroom for rendering the game
one strategy to improve performance
might be to cut the game to 60fps as
those watching your stream will be
limited to 60 FPS anyway but with this
cap in place the story isn't all that
much better the fast preset still sees
9% of all frames dropped while the
faster preset just scrapes in with no
frame drops but with a 1% low in the
game of around 40 FPS the only option to
use fast would be to reduce the visual
quality and try again but for this video
we weren't really interested in
optimizing assassin's creed specifically
for streaming with our hardware with the
8700 k limited to very fast streaming or
perhaps faster with a frame cap or even
GPU streaming in this title it will be
interesting to see how other cpus stack
up in part 2 of this investigation but
certainly with the 8700 K which is a
high-end popular gaming CPU what we've
shown here is
typical scenario for streaming in a
title that heavily utilizes the CPU and
GPU those with lower tier CPUs and in
particular lower core count Intel CPUs
will run into this very fast limit more
often and as we mentioned very fast
isn't really up to scratch for high
quality game streaming you want to get
it down to that fast preset which at
least in a heavily CPU and GPU demanding
title isn't going to be possible in a
lot of situations and introduces a lot
of frame drops compared to thief even
faster our x264 encoding preset as for
Fort sunrise and for which is far less
demanding on the CPU it's an interesting
situation because software encoding on
the CPU actually delivers higher game
performance than hardware accelerated
GPU encoding this is because there is
plenty of CPU Headroom to encode on the
CPU without eating into GPU performance
using the x264 very fast preset impacted
game performance by six percent looking
at one percent lows but the difference
between very fast and fast was only a
further 5% drop despite the massive
increase in CPU power required to encode
using the fast preset on the stream side
we saw no framedrops with the very fast
and faster presets however moving too
fast which was the minimum acceptable
quality level at least in our opinion
for game streaming that saw a 12% frame
drop rate for the encoded stream so
again when we're moving to that higher
quality preset we're starting to
introduce performance issues which is a
bit of a disappointment considering the
extra quality that the fast preset
provides and of course with a 12% frame
drop rate this does cause unpleasant
stuttering in the stream however
considering we are running the game at
nearly 120 fps we can quite easily
implement a 60 FPS cap to reduce the
game stress on the CPU with that cap in
place the fast preset becomes usable
with zero frame drops in the output the
cap also opens up the option of medium
preset encoding although with the 8700 K
we still saw around 2% of all frames
dropped with the 60 FPS cap in place
which isn't ideal if we wanted to go
with medium encoding we'd have to look
at reducing the games CPU load through
quality saint's tweaks or perhaps
getting a better quality CPU again will
further explore what cpus may be
suitable for medium encoding in this
title in a future video but it does seem
to be quite
a lot more demanding on the cpu compared
to the fast present even with frame caps
in place so with all that testing done
there's a few interesting takeaways here
the key finding for GPU buyers at the
moment is the chewings GPU encoding
engine for h.264 isn't significantly
improved compared to pascal and
certainly doesn't turn GPU encoding into
a viable option for streaming the only
time I'd suggest using envy Inc is with
fast paced high motion games with the
system that cannot CPU encourage using
the x264 faster preset or better games
with less motion should be encoded using
the very fast x264 preset rather than
envy Inc and very fast should be
achievable on most pcs that have been
built with streaming in mind on the AMD
front their encoding engine needs plenty
of work to be even considered it doesn't
work with high GPU loads and when it
does work the output quality well it's
terrible
CPU encoding is obviously a more tricky
story as what level of x264 encoding you
can manage will depend on your CPU and
crucially the type of game you're
playing without 8700 k system we range
from being stuck with very fast encoding
in a cpu demanding game to being able to
use the fast or even medium preset with
the steady 60 FPS game output at decent
quality settings in a less cpu demanding
title but what streamers should be
aiming for is to use the fast preset as
a minimum that's the first preset with
the Apple quality is decent enough at 6
megabits per twitch streaming and while
it's not fantastic for fast motion
scenes fast is much better than either
the faster or very fast presets yet it's
still achievable on decent Hardware
depending on the game the medium quality
preset is also worth trying for those
with top-end systems but it's a bit of a
diminishing return situation you require
a lot more CPU power to encode using
medium compared to fast and the quality
improvement it is noticeable but it's
not massive
whereas moving from very fast or faster
to fast it does use a lot more CPU
resources to encode using fast but the
quality improvement is also similarly
quite large I wouldn't bother with the
slow presets though those also have a
diminishing returns situation in terms
of quality for a lot more CPU
utilization while it's nice to be able
to game and stream on the one PC this
advice it really only applies to casual
or part-time streaming
anyone who is streaming professionally
or full-time should use a second
dedicated stream capture PC with a
decent capture card and CPU this then
fully offloads the encoding work and it
allows you to comfortably you say the
media preset are even slower for the
best quality streams without impacting
your game performance it also means you
won't need to think about modifying your
stream quality settings depending on the
game you're playing you simply be able
to choose say the medium preset and just
go with that for pretty much every game
you're thinking of playing at this point
though we've discovered what the optimal
presets are from a quality perspective
so in part 2 we can investigate which
CPUs are capable of encoding at these
presets so stay tuned for that as always
