little while ago now I reviewed the AMD
Athlon 200 GE actually it was about six
weeks ago now and I remember rushing to
cover it because we had our TX 20 70
samples incoming and that content was
due at the following day anyway I
promised that I would revisit discrete
GPU testing with the 200 G but of course
that got delayed by about 20 different
content pieces centered around numerous
product and game releases so once I
wrapped up the thread rep attesting I
took a quick look at the calendar and
realized that there were going to be
very few opportunities to revisit the
Athlon apu unless i acted fast so i dug
out the plucky little zen base chip and
for comparison grab the horizon 322
energy and intel's pentium g 5400 now
let me start by attempting their head
off a few concerns about this test i
haven't included the core i3 8100 and
there are a few reasons for this firstly
at the current 130 dollar us asking
price it doesn't really make that much
sense otherwise in 320 200 g which was
already my preferred choice of these two
processors well that comes in a 100
dollars us so it is quite a bit cheaper
and that being the case I didn't want to
waste another day testing a CPU that we
previously haven't recommended at a
lower price point today's video has been
sponsored by as rock and then you
phantom gaming range of Zed 390
motherboards the Zed 390 phantom gaming
6 and 9 include a blazing fast 2.5
gigabits per second network interface
offering gamers and content creators
two-and-a-half times the bandwidth
compared to standard Gigabit Ethernet
for more information please check the
link in the video description intel's
current budget lineup just isn't doing
it for me and this was the case even
before the 14 nanometer shortage in the
past i have preferred intel budget
offerings to those from AMD i love to
the pentium g 45 6 you really couldn't
talk enough about that thing i think i
made about a dozen videos within a month
a few years earlier i was raving about
the value of the core i5 6600 k compared
to the FX garbage AMD was pedaling at
the time the quad core scale like part
was a bit of alright but in two
in 18 things have changed boy oh boy
have they changed and for the better
64 toll the dual cause like the G 4560
won't ever get game is out of bed
anymore not when a processor like the
six core 12 thread risin 5 2,600 can be
had for just a hundred and sixty dollars
u.s. and even if you don't have that
kind of money the quad-core risin 320
Turner G is also a bit special at $100
and certainly the go-to option for
budget builders in fact thanks to its
exceptional value would often ranks in
the top 5 best seller list on Amazon
then for even less we have the Athlon
200 GA it's 40% cheaper at just $60 but
I have to say it doesn't quite give us
the fizz like the pure quad-core 2200 G
does the 200 GE is a dual core with SMT
it's locked
and it comes with a piddly little cooler
but again it also cost just $60 almost
half that of Intel's cheapest pentium
branded coffee-like cpu the pentium g
5400 which currently sells for a hundred
and ten dollars for a direct cost
comparison i would need to get my hands
on a seller on g 4920 a 3.2 gigahertz
dual-core with just 2 megabytes of l3
cache and that power will almost
certainly gets laid by the Athlon 200 GE
so what I want to know is if you're on a
super tight budget should you buy the
Athlon 200 GE it's really the only sub
$100 us option right now and frankly
while the pentium g 5400 is included for
comparison's sake at the current asking
price which sees it costs more than the
risin 320 200 G basically means well
it's essentially a dead part at this
point I suppose still we do have the
2200 G or the 200 GE and if you're a
gamer using a discreet graphics card
should you save every last dollar and go
with the 200 GE and then upgrade to
something better in the future something
like the rise in 5 2600 for example or
should you spend a little bit more now
and land yourself the 2200 G
it's only 40 dollars more but are you
going to see that much of a performance
increase well let's go find out the
Athlon 200 G has been tested with dual
channel ddr3 666 CL 16 memory the
pentium g 5400 with dual channel ddr3
cell 16
and the horizon 320 200 G with ddr4 3200
sales 16 memory just quickly for those
unaware the reason for the different
memory speeds comes down to what the
CPUs officially support the 200 G can
only run with ddr4 memory up to 20 666
while the Pentium processor is limited
to 2400 memory unlocked motherboards
such as the H 370 for example the
horizon 322 energy doesn't have any kind
of memory limitation at least not one
that's imposed by the motherboard or
anything else like that it's pretty much
whatever the memory controller itself
can handle typically they work just fine
with 3200 memory and we recommend using
at least 3000 spec memory with this APU
the GPU used is the RT X xx atti and yes
I know I know it's an unrealistic GPU
and yadda-yadda-yadda
but I want to be able to directly
compare the data with the higher-end
CPUs that I've already gathered and
frankly it really makes no difference
the margins seen at 1080p with these
CPUs will be much the same with the gtx
1070 especially when comparing these
cpus in modern titles as we're almost
CPU bound and to show that i will
provide some evidence and perhaps a bit
of context of course the entire point of
testing and pairing these CPUs is to
test CPU performance not low-end GPU
performance so if you understand this
and we're happy with that then let's
continue if not well not really sure
what you do with that anyway on to the
benchmarks first up we have Assassin's
Creed Odyssey and being at the CPU
demanding title that it is we find some
extremely CPU bound results with these
entry-level CPUs because of this the
1080p 1440p and for carriers are all
identical so let's just discuss the
1080p numbers the pentium g 5400 was
clearly much faster than the Athlon 200
G is it allowed for 18% more performance
and at these sub 60fps frame rates
that's a very big and very noticeable
difference however the 22 energy was 20%
faster again allowing for an average of
48 fps and that's again a very big very
noticeable performance improvement the
2200 G was also 41% fast and the 200 G
so in my opinion in certain
well worth spending the extra forty
dollars to get the real quad-core CPU
now if we look at the kind of
performance that a gtx 1070 is capable
of we see that at mep you'd still very
much be heavily cpu limited in this
title with any one of the three cpus
tested here and the same is true for
1440p as well though naturally of these
CPUs the 22 energy gets the closest
defining the 10 seventies limits it's
not until you reach 4k a resolution at
the ten seventy isn't designed for that
we finally see a GPU limited scenario
getting back to Tony P in 1440p though I
do realize that the GTX 1070 is still a
fairly powerful and reasonably expensive
GPU most entry-level CPU owners would be
looking at more like say a GTX 1050 or
rx 560 for example however remember we
are using ultra type quality settings
here granted in this whole we are using
Tim's optimized settings but they are
still very high overall in terms of
visual quality those using a low end GPU
will likely want to reduce the quality
settings and an effort to raise the
framerate and target something like
60fps and therefore you are really
hunting for the same kind of framerate
shown here with the gtx 1070 if all you
want is a console like 30fps then your
choice a cpu doesn't really matter
moving on Assassin's Creed origins
provides us with some rather different
margins here the 2200 G offers slightly
better performance than the dual-core
processors 55% more performance than the
200 G and at least 40% more than the G
5400 though the margin did extend up to
55% at the 4k resolution the dual core
SMT enabled 200 G E and G 5400 really
struggle with this title and are only
just able to deliver playable
performance frame rates with the 2200 G
were worlds better to be honest and
frame rates were knocking on the door of
60fps here we see with the gtx 1070 even
the 2200 g would be leaving performance
on the table at 1080p with the very high
quality preset you'd see much the same
at 1440p while 4k and does become
extremely GPU bound again the 22 energy
is certainly looking like the best value
option for those using a discrete GPU
next up we have battlefield 1 and here
the 22
energy was 51% faster than the 200g at
1080p and 24% faster than the Pentium G
5400 those margins were also seen at
1440p and then reduced quite heavily at
for case we start to become GPU bound
here with the 2200 G throw in the GTX
1074 a reference and here we see at
1080p we'd still be heavily CPU bound
while the GPU becomes the performance
limiting factor at 1440p for the 2000 g
and g 5400 then at 4k we're heavily GPU
bound with the 1070 with all three CPUs
Forza horizon for isn't a CPU intensive
game and as you can see even the Athlon
200 GE enables a great gaming experience
the pentium g 5400 was a little faster
and then the 22 energy a little faster
again but overall a similar experience
with all three cpus throw in the gtx
1070 and we're still GPU bound at all
three resolutions so this is a good
example of a gaming title that is mostly
GPU bound I think it's fair to say most
games probably are GPU limited rather
than CPU limited so this is a good
representation of how these CPUs will
perform in most titles of course for
this video we are primarily focusing on
CPU intensive tunnels this is where
you'll run into the most trouble with a
Laura and CPU the often NPC heavy hitman
is a CPU intensive title and here we see
the Athlon 200 G really struggling and
basically failing this test as it often
dipped below 30 FPS the pentium g 5400
was better but even then we did see
regular dips below 30 FPS in order to
keep frame rates above 30 FPS you will
require the 2200 g so for this title the
quad-core CPUs not really optional it's
more mandatory it's a must-have item
over the 200 G e and g 5400 then throw
in the gtx 10:17 again we're still
heavily CPU bound eternity P even with
the risin 320 200 G the quad-core apu
though is right on the edge of 1440p and
then at 4k we are mostly GPU bound
moving on we have project cars - and
here the pentium g 5400 really struggles
with its frame time performance average
framerate performance is comparable to
the 200 G with both falling just shy of
60 FPS of course the game was
but as we've found many times already
the 22 energy offers a significant
performance boost at 1080p the rise in
three APU was at least 57 percent faster
than 39 percent faster or 1440p and then
finally 29% faster at 4k when looking at
the gtx 1070 results we see that the
2200 g can maximize this GPU at 1080p in
1440p whereas the other two CPUs can't
then of course once again we are GPU
bound with all three processes at the 4k
resolution Rainbow six siege
ideally requires a true quad-core
processor though having said that the
Athlon 200 GE does enable highly
playable performance in our test still
at 1080p the 2200 G was 41 percent
faster while the G 5400 was 17% faster
the margin does close up a little at
1440p and then we see it completely
neutralized at 4k had I primarily tested
with a gtx 1070 then the margins would
certainly be much smaller as all three
cpus can max out this GP at 1080p and
therefore 1440p and 4k ii last game
tested is Star Wars Battlefront 2 and
here we see some pretty weak performance
from the Athlon 200 GE
attorney P the G 5400 was 33% faster and
the 2200 G 67% faster that said frame
time performance of the dual-core g50
422 energy was comparable the 2200 g was
at least 51% faster here then at 1440p
and 4k the 2200 g maintains a strong
advantage in frame time performance over
the dual-core processors throwing in the
gtx 1070 shows that none of these CPUs
can max it out at 1080p while the 22 g
and g 5400 can at 1440p though the G
5400 s frame time performance will still
be weak as we're looking at the average
frame rate here then at 4k all three
CPUs can max out the GTX 970 but we're
talking about an average of 35 fps
finally we have shadow of the Tomb
Raider and here the dual-core 200 g and
g 5400 tanked in a big way neither were
able to deliver playable performance in
our test this is certainly not a
dual-core friendly title and we will no
doubt see many more of these moving
forward the game ran reasonably well in
the 2200 G but was
basically broken on the dual cause with
the gtx 1070 even the 2200 g is leaving
loads of performance on the table at
1080p and 1440p and by the time we hit
4k we're pretty much GPU bound with an
average of just 33 FPS chances are with
the gtx 1070 you dot for medium quality
settings to try and lift up the
framerate okay so we can conclude a few
things based on the testing seen in this
video and i will start with the Athlon
200 G II and Pentium G 50 for comparison
of course we're going to have to pretend
that the G 5400 is selling at or at
least near the $64 u.s. MSRP rather than
the current 110 dollar u.s. asking price
and that would mean need 200 G E and G
5400 costs roughly the same amount of
money so that being the case which one
of the two should you buy those of you
planning on using a discrete GPU will
for the most part be best served by the
Pentium G 5400 as it was on average 16
percent faster at NEP we did see a few
scenarios where the Intel CPU was up to
30% faster that said for the most part
we did see comparable frame time
performance so probably bring that
closer down to the 16% we saw on average
anyway if you plan on using a discrete
GPU the G 5400 will provide the best
experience of these two CPUs that said
there are still a few reasons why you
might pick the Athlon 200 G over the G
5400 assuming they were selling for the
same price right now you'd obviously go
with the AMD processor in today's market
as it's almost half the price but yeah
in my hypothetical scenario here with
our similar prices they still could be
some reasons why you might buy the 200 G
8 for example 8 packs significantly
better integrated graphics therm Italy
you won't use that if you are using a
discrete graphics card and that said it
you might be lured by the superior
platform at least in my opinion the a m4
platform is superior especially at the
entry level because you can buy a be 350
or be 450 motherboard that'll support a
rise in 7 2700 processor for example and
those cost about $60 u.s. meanwhile I'd
suggest you're looking at about $70 us
for a decent quality B 360 motherboard
or
hundred dollars for a basic Zed 370
board and again I suspect that both of
those boards probably will throttle with
a high and a six or a court Intel
processor I also suspected that where at
the end of the road for 300 series
chipsets there'll be no new CPUs at
least no new CPUs well into the future
with known shrinks and more performance
and that kind of good stuff
you will probably just see refreshes at
this point so not terribly exciting for
the Intel 300 series boards on the other
side of that though we have the AMD 300
series and 400 series chipsets such as
your be 350 boards and your be 450
boards pretty much any AM for board and
they will support the upcoming 7
nanometers in true CPU so yeah that's
kind of nice this means while the G 5400
is hands down the better gaming CPU with
a discrete GPU even at $64 u.s. it's not
really the obvious choice while the
current want her intend all the us price
as I've said makes it a complete not a
write-off at the end of the day though
for anyone with a big enough budget to
include well any kind of discrete
graphics card I wouldn't even bother
with the Athlon 200 GE it's a locked
part which in my opinion makes it
virtually worthless for those trying to
maximize value admittedly it is a great
sort of general computing type product
it's excellent for web browsing getting
emails and all that kind of stuff so
probably you know a really great CPU for
building a budget system for office use
or your parents or your grandparents or
whatever I imagine that most of you
almost everyone watching this video
would be world's better off spending the
$40 more to land the rise in 320 200 G
just a much more capable CPU and
therefore in my opinion there's no real
reason to even consider the 200 GE also
something that I didn't touch on in this
video but we have covered numerous times
in the past on the channel is the
overclocking potential of the 2200 G so
there is some more free performance to
be had so this really means it is the
best value entry-level CPU available
right now and spending less than $100 us
on something else doesn't really end up
saving you any money at all at least in
my opinion and with that I am going to
end this one if you enjoy the video
