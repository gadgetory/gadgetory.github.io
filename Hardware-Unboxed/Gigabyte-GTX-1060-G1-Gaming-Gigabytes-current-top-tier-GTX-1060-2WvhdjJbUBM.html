not one not two but rather for gtx 1060
models the lineup consists of the g1
gaming 6g g1 gaming d5 6 g windforce OC
and the tiny little mini ITX OC which is
a product i hope to look at in the near
future at just 170 millimeters long and
might be 12% longer than the Nano but
it's also considerably cheaper anyway on
hand today is the flagship g1 gaming 6g
model which features all the bells and
whistles of a typical g1 gaming card
typically the highest tier gigabyte
cards a part of the extreme gaming
family but at this stage we haven't
heard of a gtx 1060 models that may or
may not be in the works the previous
generation maxwell cards do feature an
extreme gaming GTX 960 and gtx 950 so
there's every likelihood that we'll see
a 1060 model at some point while the GTX
1080 and gtx 1070 g1 gaming models
feature a trio of 90 millimeter fans the
gtx 1060 version has been downgraded to
a pair of 90 millimeter fans of course
the 1060 is only a 120 watt TDP rated
part the wind force 2x cooling system
should more than suffice the wind force
2x employs a little bit of gigabyte
trickery seen on the previous models as
well as the higher end extreme gaming
the same alternating fan design spins
into action to reduce air turbulence
which maximizes heat dissipation and
helps to minimize noise output - also
the same unique blade fan feature is
present and gigabyte claims a 3d striped
curve on the fan surface improves
airflow by 23% over traditional fans
unfortunately I'm gonna have to take
them at their word since my wind tunnel
has currently been rented out to Red
Bulls f1 team go Ricardo helping direct
the airflow generated by the fans is a
black plastic fan shroud that encases
the graphics card along the leading edge
of the g1 gaming and some RGB LED
backlit features such as the gigabyte
logo and the fans top label the fan swap
feature means that the fans have the
ability to start and stop dynamically as
needed on the front side we see some
orange accents which I guess look cool
if you're featuring orange and you build
on the back side a stylish metal
backplate extends the entire length of
the card speaking of which the gtx 1060
g1 gaming measures 275 millimeters long
ripping off the cooler we find to fail
large heat things that are connected by
a pair of six millimeter copper heat
pipes these are composite heat pipes
which gigabyte says boasts 29 percent
greater cooling capacity over regular
heat pipes the heat sink which comes in
contact with the gtx 1060 GPU features
heat pipe direct touch which is designed
to maximize heat extraction from this
hot spot with a cooler off we also get
our first look at the PCB and there are
some nowhere the upgrades here the
standard three plus one power phase
design and the farmers edition has been
upgraded to six plus one and helping to
take advantage of the upgraded power
delivery is an eight pin PCIe power
connector capable of delivering 150
watts alone out of the box the gtx 1060
g1 gaming operates at a base clock of
1594 megahertz with a boost of 1809
megahertz apparently gigabyte does
cherry-pick the GPU dyes that make their
way into the g1 gaming models thanks to
the company's GPU gauntlet sorting
technology so you should be guaranteed
to win the silicon lottery to a degree
anyway at the i/o end of the g1 gaming
we find a pretty standard layout
featuring a single dueling DVI output
HDMI 2.0 B and three DisplayPort 1.4
outputs this means for monitor
multi-view it is supportive for those of
you like to get down swordfish soul
using gigabyte extreme engine software
utility gamers can boost the g1 gaming
to a core clock of 1620 megahertz
resulting in a boost clock of 1847
megahertz the click of a button when
selecting the OC mode for those of you
wanting to overclock the GTX 1060 g1
gaming the software enables easy
overclocking and allows the user to
increase the thermal target as well as
the power target the user can monitor
the GPUs vitals an easy overclocking
modes exist along with the more complex
manual overclocking options voltage
states can be adjusted and custom fan
curves can also be created finally the
all-important RGB lighting can be
configured here and there's a few of the
more standard effects to play with when
it came to overclocking we were able to
increase the memory speed by 293
megahertz resulting in a total frequency
of 2,295 megahertz
the core was pushed to a base clock of
1700 50 megahertz with the boost clock
speed 1965 megahertz of course due to
Nvidia is GPU boost 3.0 we know the card
can run faster than the suggester boost
clock if kept under the thermal and
power targets in the case of the g1
gaming disallowed the card to hold an
operating frequency of around
2.1 gigahertz after a 20-minute stress
test which is a good result so with all
that said let's jump to the benchmarks
and see how I performed first up we have
battlefield 4 now at the Box the gtx
1060 g1 gaming is just 3% faster than
the founders Edition and also matched
the palette super jet stream custom
overclocking the g1 gaming resulted in
an average frame rate of 73 FPS which is
a decent 9% boost over the factory
overclock this time we see a performance
boost of 11% over the factory overclock
when testing with Far Cry primal that's
a pretty good result though it did mean
the out of box and custom overclock the
g1 gaming only matched the super jet
stream we find much the same when
testing with star wars battlefront
through overclocking we're able to
extract 10% more performance making the
g1 gaming 12% faster than the stock
found a solution the overclocking gains
in the division weren't as strong as
we've seen previously this time our
custom overclock improved performance by
8 percent to 52 fps and like the super
jet stream we find the g1 gaming does
consume slightly more power than
invidious Bowser's Edition still a total
system Drive just 207 watts is extremely
good given the resulting performance
overclocked the total system draw
increased by the 6 percent which is
great
given we often saw gains of around 10%
now for the operating temperatures the
g1 gaming match the founders Edition
with a load temperature of just 64
degrees which is quite a bit better than
the 70 degrees the super jet stream runs
out overclocking the g1 gaming only saw
the thermals increase by 2 degrees which
is still cooler than the palette card
running at its factory overclock to put
those temperature results into context
here are a few recordings of Hallie's
various graphics cards surrounded under
full load and at idle
the g1 gaming is a nice upgrade over the
fans edition for those that don't
require a blower style cooler which I
assume is a good many of you to revise
PCB design and upgraded power input Ben
you aren't in danger of over drawing
from the PCI Express slot when
overclocking the beefy cooler also
allows the g1 gaming to stay cool and
quiet every when operating it over two
gigahertz when compared to the pallet
gtx 1060 super jet stream the g1 gaming
does run cooler but that's about it
the custom overclocking performance is
about the same and the operating volume
is also very similar gigabyte certainly
has the better cooler so for me this
just gets their card over the line
price-wise it's still difficult to
accurately gauge where these cards are
coming in the model reviewed here is
currently selling for 290 US dollars or
500 Aussie which is a bit rich that said
the gtx 1060 d 560 version of this card
is priced at 250 u.s. though it's
currently out of stock everywhere I
looked realistically I don't suggest
spending much more than 250 US or 450 a
you on a gtx 1060 graphics card must be
on that the cost per frame becomes way
too high overall the gigabyte gtx 1060
g1 gaming is a nice 1060 graphics card
that delivers on all fronts having been
impressed with this gigabyte 1060 I'm
very keen to check out the compact ITX
version so hopefully I can get my hands
on that one soon thanks for joining me

benchmark what do you guys think of the
