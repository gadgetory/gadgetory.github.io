yesterday we took a rather long and
quite in-depth look at the thread ripper
2990 WX and 2950 x in short the 2950 x
really impressed us with solar
performance across the board at a super
competitive price
the 2990 WX though that was a bit less
impressive with mixed performance and a
very high asking price currently Windows
10 is mostly being blamed for the mixed
results and perhaps rightfully so we'll
have to look into this a bit further and
keep our fingers crossed that we
actually get an update and not to just
in the future in the meantime there is
something else we can address something
that a large number of people did voice
concern for not just about our testing
but the testing of most other media
outlets and that was that we tested just
a single application at a time we had
always plan to make a separate
multitasking focus benchmark and I said
as much in yesterday's video while
editing and wrapping up that video I
began looking into multitasking
performance and after an additional two
days of testing we've got some more
results to discuss for this test the
thread Ripper 2990 WX has been compared
directly with the core I know in 79 ad
XE and we have five batches of
multitasking benchmark results to check
out all of the testing was conducted
using a stock out-of-the-box setting so
no CPU overclocking at all and both CPUs
were cooled with a 240 millimeter closed
loop cooler installed on each CPU and
there was some jumping up and down in
the comment section not a lot but some
people were claiming that the Wraiths
Ripper was causing their 2990 WX to
throttle and that's why our benchmarks
were were mixed but just to clear all
that up the wraith ripper doesn't cause
the stock 2990 WX to throttle in any
benchmarks that we ran keeps very cool
as we showed in a review we even showed
footage of it running some core heavy
workloads and it was holding really
respectable clock speeds 3.3 gigahertz
so that's what you'd expect to see out
of that CPU so not sure where all that's
coming from anyway moving on both
systems have been configured with 64
gigabytes of ddr4
each using 8 8 gigabyte modules and this
did a limit the 2990 WX ddr4 3000 while
the 79 80 XE could run much higher but
we settled with a low latency ddr4 3,200
memory to try and keep things even and I
suppose somewhat realistic now the
following graphs might look a little odd
at first especially compared to what
you're probably used to seeing a promise
but I'm hoping this format will be
easier to follow as it gives you all the
information on screen at once anyway
let's get into the benchmarks I'll
explain as we go
ok so first up we're gonna look at how
the 2990 WX in 79 ad XE compared when
running blender open data and 7-zip
please note the results here show how
these CPUs performing each application
individually so that is to say blender
was executed and then completed before
moving on to testing 7-zip so these are
just standard benchmark results here the
2990 WX completed the BMW 27 workload
36% faster and the barbershop workload
at 25% faster when compared to the core
on own processor then with 7-zip we see
the 2990 WX is a hundred and sixteen
percent faster for decompression work
but 35 percent slower for compression
work now let's redo these benchmarks but
with blender and 7-zip running
simultaneously sevens it will be on a
continuous loop while blender runs
standard batch of tests so here we see a
few interesting things the 2990 WX is
now 58 percent faster for the BMW 27
workload and 30 percent faster for the
barbershop workload however the 7-zip
performance is less favorable here the
2990 WX was a hundred and sixteen
percent faster previously when looking
at the decompression performance and now
it is three percent slower
that said though whereas it was 35
percent slower previously for the
compression test it's now only sixteen
percent slower basically the twenty nine
ninety WX was already mighty impressive
in the blender rendering test and adding
7-zip to the mix makes it look more
impressive but the massive advantage did
have in seven zips now go on making
inferior in both the compression and
decompression tests the 79 80 XC
certainly appears to be prioritizing
7-zip while the 29 WX is prioritizing
blender or at least this is how it's
working within Windows 10 next up I'm
testing with handbrake and real
for ham break I have an h.264 4k 60fps
video that I'm converting to h.265 4k
60fps and I'm reporting the average
frame rate as well as the total render
time then real bench will be running
it's heavy multitasking workload on a
loop
the 2990 WX doesn't do all that well in
handbrake and here it was 31% slower
than 79-80 XC it's also not great in
real bench either taking 10% longer to
complete a single pass so let's combine
these two tests and run them
simultaneously with both applications
running simultaneously the 2990 WX is
now 17 percent slower than the seminar
aid exe in handbrake which is a
reasonable improvement but of course it
is still slower
however while we did see a reduced
margin in handbrake we see the margin
increase a little for real bench the
2990 WX is now 15 percent slower so
overall it wasn't really able to make up
ground on the 79 80 XC in this
multitasking benchmark one of the worst
results for the 2990 WX seen in our day
1 coverage was found when testing with
veracrypt the one gigabyte test so I'm
combining that test with one of the best
results for the 32 core processor which
was seen when testing with Corona
here the 2990 WX was 28% faster than the
79ad XC and as we've seen it always
seems to do very well in rendering
workloads
however for veracrypt it was 47% slower
so not a great result that one but
anyway let's run them simultaneously now
and see if that changes anything as we
saw in the first series of multitasking
benchmarks AMD seems to prioritize
rendering workloads while Intel favors
the more memory sensitive workloads the
79ad XE took almost 6 times longer than
the 2990 WX to complete the corona
benchmark while it only sorry 7 percent
reduction in decryption performance
meanwhile the 2990 WX sorry 34 percent
reduction in decryption performance and
a 61 percent increase in rendering time
so the 32 core processor does appear
more balanced here and so it should be
with 14 more calls to play with still we
do have mixed results for the 2990 WX
it was absolutely amazing in Corona and
horrible and veracrypt and that's true
whether you run these applications
individually or simultaneously moving on
this time we have three
applications handbrake cpu-z which is a
synthetic benchmark and then 7-zip
here's how they all perform individually
on each CPU the 2990 WX is 22% slower
and handbrake 75% faster and cpu-z and
again we see the same mixed 7-zip
performance as we discussed earlier
running all three applications
simultaneously does provide some
interesting results whereas the 2990 WX
was 22% slower and handbrake previously
it's now 29% faster so that's a very
impressive result that said it does take
a big hit and cpu-z but even then it was
still 21 percent faster than 79 80 XE
and then finally even in sevens that we
find positive results for the 32 chord
processor it managed to maintain a good
chunk of its decompression performance
and the 79ad XE took a big enough hit in
the compression test that the 2990 WX
was able to just edged ahead so this is
the first truly great result that we've
seen for the 2990 WX needs multitasking
benchmarks especially given that I
haven't included a rendering workload to
help prop the 32 core processor up last
up I have another triple header using
povery WinRAR and f1 2017 Popper a
provided the 2990 WX with its best
result in our day 1 review and as you
can see it's 36% faster in the 79 80 XE
in this test win rather though isn't
very cool heavy but it is extremely
memory intensive so I'll be keen to see
if that messes with the povery
performance at all the 2990 WX was 59%
slower than the 79 80 XC when testing
with winrar or another way of putting it
the 79 80 XC was 142 percent faster
finally we have f1 2017 in here the 2990
WX was 24% slower when comparing the
average frame rate of 30% slower for the
1% low result so now it's time to run
everything at the same time as we've
seen time and time again when
multitasking the 2990 w axes advantage
and render applications is only extended
whereas it was 36% faster than the 79 ad
XE previously when testing with povery
it's now 45% faster meanwhile it was 59%
slower and winrar and now it's just 37%
slower it's still slower of course but a
greatly reduced margin however things do
go home
wrong for gaming performance and now f1
2017 is completely unplayable
although the 79-80 XC did produce a 1%
low result of just 34 FPS this is a
little deceiving as the game was very
playable and only once or twice per lap
did I notice a big lag spike for the
most part frame rates were up around 100
FPS and it provided a surprisingly good
experience the 2990 WX on the other hand
was a stuttering mess and would have
been impossible to play thankfully how
the can benchmark did take care of all
our driving for me so again mixed
performance from the 2990 WX in this
test ok well i'm now armed with a lot
more knowledge in regards to how the
2990 WX performs than I was a few days
ago when I was in the late stages of
wrapping up my initial 2990 WX and 2950
x a review that said the additional
information hasn't really changed that
much throwing more work at these CPUs
just provided I suppose more mixed
results whereas you'd expect the 32 core
processor to really crush an 18 core
processor under these conditions it just
didn't steal the performance hiccups
that we've seen with the 2990 WX so far
I might not all be down to the pneuma
configuration the increased memory
latency for half the cause and the
limited per core bandwidth when fully
utilized it's looking more and more like
another big culprit here is once again
the window scheduler which to put it
plainly has been known to be a bit
garbage so that being the case it is
certainly possible that a future Windows
Update could improve things for the 2990
WX and we have already seen this in the
past with the first generation rise in
CPUs having said all that if you are
putting down your own hard-earned cash
to buy the 2990 WX and you're planning
on using it with Windows 10 then I'd
rather not assume anything here and just
work off the information that we
currently have so taking the information
that we currently have at hand into full
account
I'd buy neither the twenty nine ninety W
X or the 79 80 X II instead as I said in
yesterday's review I would get the 29th
50 X the 32 core processor just seems a
bit too risky at the moment the mix
Windows performance in the extreme price
is sketchy enough but I'm almost certain
by this time next year
we'll have something significantly
better on offer using the seven
nanometer process so from a consumer
standpoint in the twenty nine ninety WX
is very poorly timed in my opinion but
from AMD's perspective I certainly
understand why they've released such a
product in 2018 anyway as always I will
continue to benchmark as updates and new
information come in and I'd love nothing
more than be able to get right back into
it with a Windows Update so fingers
crossed
