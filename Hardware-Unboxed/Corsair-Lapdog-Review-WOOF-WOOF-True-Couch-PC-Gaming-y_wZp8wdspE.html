bolted to the desk unable to venture to
the comfort of the couch without picking
up a controller or even worse using the
dreaded console I'm joking of course the
gamers who enjoy using the lateness of
the keyboard and mouse have been longing
for an elegant solution to recline you
on the couch and playing games on their
TV we've seen some attempted solutions
before but most come at the expense of a
full-sized mechanical keyboard or
included tiny and weird wireless mouse
with no extra buttons that you can
barely hold on to pair that with a
miniscule mouse pad and you may as well
have just stayed at your desk on top of
this to my knowledge there's never
really been a comfortable solution that
could provide a stable surface to play
on I've tried using a chopping board as
a mouse pad but it's not really
comfortable and you can't fit your
keyboard on there too you can't just use
the couch either it's too low and the
mouse isn't track well enough to play
proper games finally I don't consider
leaning forward and playing on the
coffee table a real solution either what
are we left with until now not much but
allow me to introduce the lap dog lap
dog is a new gaming control center from
Corsair and aims to deliver living room
gaming with zero compromise when I first
saw the box i was little surprised but
also pleased to how big it was if this
was truly going to deliver a great
living room gaming that it certainly
needed to be bigger than solutions i'd
seen before let's take a tour around the
device first there are two main pieces
to the lap dog the control platform and
the padded lap cushion the life cushion
can be quickly and easily attached and
removed thanks to six magnetic points to
grab the control center quite firmly the
cushion itself is made from memory foam
and honestly it feels very comfortable
in your legs lastly there's a little
spot to store the allen key though I
think it would have been smart if this
was magnetic to to stop it falling out
onto the control center this is where
all the action goes down on the right we
begin with a sizable 11 inch by 11 inch
mouse pad plate this is the textured
aluminium surface that screws into the
body of the control center I mouse
tracked very well on this surface as it
expect and it also provides good grip
for a mouse pad of your own to sit on
top unfortunately I didn't have any
mouse pads that were small enough to use
on the mouse pad plate but it was really
no issue to play on the plate itself on
the left side
lapdogs the keyboard tray this is sized
perfectly to fit courses k 65 in case 70
series of keyboards and there's an
adaptor plate on the right-hand side
just suit the different lengths to these
keyboards with the adapter plate removed
my case 7 is slotted in absolutely
perfectly running across the top of the
keyboard tray is removable cover for the
cable compartment this is where your
feed your cabling from your keyboard
through to the USB hub with right hand
corner of the device this USB hub is the
heart of the laptop powered by a DC
input this USB 3 hub provides users with
four powered USB 3 ports two of these
ports are internal and a design to
connect your keyboard and mouse the
keyboard uses the aforementioned cable
route through the top of the lap dog and
there's a small port at the top left the
mouse pad for your mouse cable if you're
using a wireless mouse you could also
plug your receiver in at this point 2 on
the right-hand side you'll find two
external USB 3 ports which could be used
for a USB headset and things like your
smartphone or USB thumb drives the
closest one to the user is also a fast
charging port so this is where you'll be
best off connecting your phone tablet or
Bluetooth speaker for a quick charge
lastly in terms of ports who find the DC
import and host PC ports at the back
right of the laptops body plugging into
these ports is the supplied and can join
us be in DC cable this cable is plenty
of length is 16 feet or just under 5
meters and at the other end you attach
the little DC power pack and plug the
USB end into any USB 3 port on your PC
interestingly the DC power pack I
received was rated for only 1 amp this
makes me question how fast charging the
fast charging port which is capable of
delivering 1.5 amps if you possibly be
with this supplied power pack especially
if you're running a mouse keyboard and
other devices through the hub to setting
up the lap dog was pretty simple
although you wouldn't want to be sharing
a keyboard between your desktop and the
device is it's not super fast to install
and remove as mentioned there's a
supplied allen key that it can be
clumsily stored in lap dog and this is
used to unscrew the two screws on the
cable cover single screw on the keyboard
adapter and four screws on the mouse pad
once these are all removed you can slot
the keyboard in first and stuff the
cables in the top section course has
supplied a couple of zip ties too so you
can tie your cables down to little cable
tie anchors on the floor of the cable
compartment next I simply plug to a
mouse in screwed the pieces back in and
I was ready to go for actual gaming
couch the luck dog was really cool it
was super comfortable in my lap first of
all I played for several hours in
starcraft 2 a game that's super
frustrating to play if you're in an
uncomfortable mouse position it was also
quite good for black ops 3 i'm not going
to say i was as good as i was at my desk
in multiplayer but it's pretty much fine
for single-player and certainly any sort
of casual style gaming my only economic
complaint would be about the front edge
of black dog due to its shape it's
actually quite a sharp edge and if i had
the lap dog position in a way where my
wrist will leaning against it then it
definitely dug in a bit i think a curved
edge or some sort of padding here would
have been amazing my only other
criticism of the device is lack of a
three-and-a-half millimeter pass through
if you use analog headphones then you're
kind of stuck unless your cable is
somehow long enough to reach the
computer from the couch I feel like this
would have been an easy and inexpensive
inclusion and it was a shame to see it
was missing USB or wireless headphones
of course work very well with this setup
all around the lap dogs really awesome
implementation of catch keyboard and
mouse gaming I think users will have to
keep in mind that they'll really need a
second keyboard a mouse to keep
permanently in the lap dog who ever
unless they really don't mind swapping
them out each time but since there are
six screws and potentially cable ties
involved I can't really see this
happening the lap dog would definitely
be my go-to for couch gaming from now on
and I really look forward to running
into you guys on the steam service from
my couch I don't have official pricing
information as of yet but it looks like
you'll be able to pick up the lap dog as
a standalone 490 US dollars or 115
australian dollars or 200 US dollars
with a corset gaming keyboard and likely
around 250 australian dollars for that
setup not exactly cheap but when we're
gaming peripherals ever inexpensive let
me know what you think of the lap dog in
the comments i'm your host first name at
last name as always and i'll see you
guys next time
it's not safe love lockdown</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
