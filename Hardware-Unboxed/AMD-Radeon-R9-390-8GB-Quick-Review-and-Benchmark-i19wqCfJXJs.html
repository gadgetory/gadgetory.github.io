I'm your host Matt and today we've got
the first exclusive look at AMD's Radeon
r9 390 we covered a bit of the history
of the gcn architecture that this card
uses in the r9 390x video so if you want
to learn a bit about that make sure to
head over to that video next
now the r9 390 and the r9 390x due to
the exact same core frequency and the
same memory frequency the only
difference is the core configuration the
r9 390 is equipped with 2560 SPU's and
160 ta use this is 9 percent less than
the r9 390x it does however feature the
same 64 rfps when AMD's 200 series came
out the r9 290 was the best value of the
bunch it appears as though the r9 390
will follow suit
it sets to be priced over 20 percent
cheaper but it looks like on paper the
performance could only be about 9
percent slower I know I'm keen to find
out let's take the card to the lab and
benchmark it in Crysis 3 we saw the r9
390 average 37 frames per second two
frames less than the 390 X and 3 frames
more than the GTX 970 in battlefield
hardline the 390 produced a smooth 59
frames per second three less than the r9
390x
and seven more than the GTX 970 in dying
light 390 gamers are playable 43 frames
just 2 less than the 390x and three less
than the GTX 970 in this instance in GTA
5 the 390 produced an average of 58
frames which was 4 frames less than the
390 X and the exact same as the GTX 970
finally in Metro redux the 390 gave us
39 frames per second that was 4 frames
less than both the 390 X and the GTX 970
as we suspected the r9 390 is going to
be the best value card in the 300 series
line priced at 330 US dollars in our
tests it was an average of just 6
percent slower
however the price is said to be at least
20% cheaper as we mentioned earlier
during our benchmark
the r9 390 and the GTX 970 trader blows
after averaging out the scores
difference turned out to be almost
exactly zero so it makes sense of these
cards are at the same price point this
has been Matt for Hardware unboxed we
hope you've enjoyed our first exclusive
look at the Radeon r9 390 don't forget
