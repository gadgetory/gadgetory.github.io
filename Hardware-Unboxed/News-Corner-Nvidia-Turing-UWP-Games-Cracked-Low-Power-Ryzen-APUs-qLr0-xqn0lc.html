a new weekly segment where we'll be
going through some of the bigger news
topics we come across and giving some
thoughts and opinions along the way you
guys often ask us to cover or comment on
various news stories so now we are I
guess so I figured I'd kick things off
with a look at the biggest game water of
the week which was Kingdom Come
deliverance
probably not the most anticipated launch
for a lot of you guys but it did develop
a niche following among those interested
in its take on medieval strictly no
magical fantasy RPG it was also
crowdfunded to the tune of 1.1 million
pound so there was certainly a lot of
demand for this sort of thing among
those liked to crowdfund games I guess
anyway the game came out earlier this
week on February 13 and early opinions
from critics and users seems to be mixed
turning on positive sounds like the game
is extremely buggy though and that's
despite an enormous 23 gigabyte day one
patch fixing a lot of the pre-launch
issues it could take a couple of weeks
for even game breaking bugs to be
addressed so if you're thinking of
playing the game it's probably best to
wait until those glaring issues are
fixed as for gameplay people who know
the game is designed to be realistic are
quite pleased with the results and the
flexibility of the open-world though
I've seen a couple of complaints about
the restrictive save system and
difficult lock-picking
well it's not something Steve or I have
played yet and we are exploring whether
it's worth benchmarking we have heard
the top visual quality settings are
quite demanding on PC let us know your
experiences with the game and what it's
like to play it and you know whether
it's worth a look on our test systems
from a benchmarking perspective there's
been a bit of mixed news on this next
topic relating to invidious churring
graphics cards that are rumored for
launch next month initial reports
suggested it would be just another line
of consumer cards or perhaps a codename
for a single card but the latest
information claims is actually a
cryptocurrency mining specific line or
architecture there's basically no
information to go at this stage aside
from the discussion around the codename
that references of course famous
computer scientist Alan sure
it's also made more confusing with all
the discussion around Volta and
potentially ampair as well again we
don't know much about either of those
architectures either or you know even
where the ampere really is the
replacement from Pascal and we suspect
probably not in that case anyway better
truing if this really is a
cryptocurrency mining architecture a
couple of things spring to mind firstly
of course it's great news for gamers
because you know provided it's actually
popular among crypto - it might ease the
demand for gaming GPUs and allow gamers
to actually buy cards at half reasonable
prices however it does have to make
sense from - otherwise I'll just keep
buying consumer GPUs so it needs to
provide significantly more mining
performance for the price while also
offering resale value not 100% sure how
that achieves something like that or
whether you know we might see mining
restricted cards for gaming at the same
time but if the rumor is true it's nice
to see in video actually working on
fixing the mining issue and they might
even be able to cash in a bit here I
don't expect a lot of you guys to
actually be running Intel's
integrated graphics for gaming but I did
think this story on their latest drivers
was pretty interesting so if the 15 dot
65 dot 3.49 for for a driver and I think
Intel could probably simplify their
names here a little bit they've they've
added an ability to auto configure game
settings for the best performance on the
integrated GPUs and that's similar to
what we've seen already in NVIDIA
GeForce experience so at the moment this
feature is listed as a beta and it only
works in 12 games which does include
popular tiles like GTA 5 overwatch and
dota 2 but it surprisingly misses out on
games like 49 obviously this is a very
early project for Intel and they're you
know they're looking for feedback on how
it works and what games to add so if you
do have a integrated graphics chip that
you game on probably worth giving it a
look
the I GPUs Intel are supporting with the
feature anything 6th gen or newer and
that includes the upcoming 8th gen core
processes with Radeon rx Vega M graphics
and that's probably why they've launched
this order configuration features so you
know those buying systems with the much
much more powerful Vega integrated
graphics can quickly configure game
settings for the best performance on
these chips personally I think configure
games is all part of the fun of PC
gaming there you know a lot of people
just like having that quick and easy
utility just launch games and play with
a more console like experience that's
fine as long as the tunity works well
and doesn't suggest settings that will
you know make you run at horrible
quality or some 30 fps and I think with
a bit of work and a few extra games
added into the mix this could be quite
good for those who like to game on
integrated graphics earlier this week
hopefully you saw our coverage of Raven
Ridge and the new horizon 520 400g and
risin 320 200 G will just shortly after
those AP u.s. launch a couple of new ApS
was spotted in an AZ rock M for CPU
support list the risin 5 2400 GE and the
rise in 320 200 G details are slim at
this stage but it seems these ApS are
low-power variants of the same silicon
capping the TDP 235 watts instead of 65
watts and reducing base frequencies from
3.5 and 3.6 gigahertz on the CPU to just
3.2 gigahertz AMD hasn't officially
announced these parts yet but they do
make sense particularly for small
form-factor builds that can't fit in
massive coolers reducing the TDP to 35
watts and allowing a less capable
smaller caller to do the job would be
great in some use cases I do expect most
of you guys building rise and AP systems
will stick to the non e models for the
most part though and we have also
already seen this apu scale quite well
at lower TDP s-- rise and mobile AP use
are 12 to 25 watts and use basically the
same chips though they do push CPU clock
speeds down even further than these a
parts rise and Mobile's game performance
is still very good though so expect
similar from these each series parts no
word on an official launch date or
pricing at this stage for them as though
so keep an eye out you know in the
couple of weeks Intel quietly pushed out
the core i3 8130 you this week a new 15
watt laptop CPU for ultra portable
devices like the 8th gen core i3 line on
desktops which are basically quad core
core i5s in the previous generation this
new core i3 u series CPU is basically a
dual core Core i5 from the previous gen
it has two cores and four threads with
the base clock of 2.2 gigahertz and a
boost clock of 3.4 gigahertz it's not
just a straight rebrand
Jen parts though Intel has gone with a
lower base clock than the old core i5
line but pushes the boost clock up a bit
something like the core i5 7200 you used
a 2.5 gigahertz pace and 3.1 gigahertz
boost worth you know here we're looking
at 2.2 Gertz base 3 point 4 gigahertz
boost on the same core in thread count
the core i3 8130 also packs for Meg of
l3 cache up from 3 Meg and now supports
ddr4 2400 up from ddr4 2133 and of
course the integrated GPU is unchanged
it's not the biggest news but it does
allow 8th gen CPUs to filter down and
cheaper ultraportable laptops most of
the high-end stuff will still use them
much faster quad-core CPUs their core i3
occupy you know an important place for
those mid tier laptops and having
current gen dual cause makes sense in
that category moving on into a bit of
phone SOC discussion for a brief moment
this week a number of websites got their
hands on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 for
some early benchmarking with a Qualcomm
reference design if you're not familiar
with the smartphone SOC landscape this
Snapdragon 845 is the upcoming high-end
SOC from Qualcomm and that's set to
replace the Snapdragon 835 that was
widely used in flagship phones we should
see the Snapdragon 845 in most top-end
phone launches in 2018 if you're
interested in a deep analysis of the
performance there's no better site than
an antique for that but I'll summarize
their findings here CPU IPC appears to
be improved by around 26% relative to
the Snapdragon 835 which when paired
with the higher clocks delivers you know
around a 45 percent boost in
floating-point performance and 31% in
integer system benchmarks didn't show as
large of a gain in a lot of tests but
it's still impressive on the GPU front
it looks like we get roughly 30% more
performance from the new adrena at 6:30
with higher frames per watt which is
always very important with smartphone
form factors and then tech also found
similar overall power consumption to the
Snapdragon 835 in a very brief test so
that should mean excellent battery life
and much improved efficiency when
considering the improved performance
something to look out for in 2018 a
couple of other interesting topics
around today's video starting with the
news the pirates have cracked
Microsoft's Universal windows
platform protection PC gamers will be
familiar with you WP as it's the way
Microsoft package and distribute their
first party games exclusively through
the Windows Store which is almost
universally hated by gamers and one of
the key reasons we avoid benchmarking
with you WP games it basically sucks
anyway so the you WP protection system
has been cracked starting with zoo
tycoon ultimate animal collection which
obviously everyone was eagerly waiting
to be cracked apparently the game was
protected by five layers of DRM
including arts and anti-tamper the
Microsoft Store uwp systems and Xbox
Live it's not clear whether this means
all you WP games can now be cracked but
at least one has and that usually means
the flood gates have been opened we
don't advocate for piracy here at all so
please buy games and support developers
if you want to play their stuff but it's
always interesting when increasingly
tough DRM is cracked these days speaking
of you WP games we now have the full
system requirements from Microsoft and
res Xbox and PC game Co fees which is
launching on March 20th rather than just
giving basic minimum and recommended
specs rare has delivered six full
configurations that should deliver
performance anywhere from five for TP @
30fps to 4k 60fps depending on the
listed hardware and quality levels those
with Intel integrated iris pro 6200
graphics from the Broadwell era or iOS
540 from skylake should be able to run
it at Omega 540 P and 30 fps in more
modern terms this should mean is
playable on rise mobile but not on Intel
H in CPUs 720p 30fps requires an Intel Q
9450 or AMD phenom 2 and either a GT
10:30 or r7 450 in modern GPU terms
1080p 30 medium quality can be achieved
with an i3 41 70 and a GTX 1050 TI rx
460 1080p 60 at medium that needs an AI
540 960 with the GTX 1060 rx 470 and
then pushing up to 4k 30 with ultra they
suggested gtx 1070 or Arc's Vega 56 and
if you want 60fps you'll need a gtx
1080i or vegas
for there's always a couple of strange
things in the specification this
particularly as they suggest a gtx 1064
1080p 60fps gaming and just medium
settings but then apparently only gtx
1070 is required for 4k 30 at Ultra so a
little bit odd there oh and the game
asks for 60 gig of drive space so expect
a fairly large install size final brief
topic for this week a soos has launched
the Zen book 13 UX 3 3 1 which is a
13-inch ultra portable with a core i5
8250 U and NVIDIA GeForce MX 150
graphics it's extremely rare to see
discrete graphics in a 13-inch slim and
light laptop but a soos has done it with
this new Zen book so it's now available
for about a thousand US dollars if
anyone is interested that's it for this
week's news corner I'll hopefully be
back next week with a look at whatever
pops up between now and then let us know
what you think of doing a weekly news
segment below and I'll catch you next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
