boxes with Matt we are here at episode
number 7 and today I've got a new tool
it's some elephant tusk ivory scissors
unfortunately they don't come and hard
around box blue but i'll make this work
so i got a couple of requests the other
week to get a p.o box so you guys can
start sending me some stuff so i went
sword that out the other day and you
guys can jump into the description below
and find my p.o box so I'm not sure if
I'm looking forward to getting what you
guys send me but it will certainly be
featured on the next episode so let me
have it I guess first we'll start with a
smallest box which is this one it's
pretty light Oh baby this elephant tough
scissors eeee way better than using a
noise all right this might be the most
gorgeous box of every scene from inside
and I've got finally something actually
I saw online the other day and I'm like
damn I want one of these things it's in
al gato game capture card so I've
actually never used one usually used
shadow play when I rarely very
occasionally record gameplay I imagine
this is going to be a lot better
something up the box and take a look got
a USB cable hdmi cable do a little
sticker and that's the device itself so
it's pretty small ports on the back hdmi
out maybe i'll get some fifa 17 footage
with this thing
more of an unboxing than a real boxer
alright what's next got a DHL box of
medium-sized do I smell a gaming
peripheral think I do oh Jesus haha the
scariest box I've ever seen it's a
creative headset so this is the creative
Draco's HS 880 so two more of a budget
headset I remember the exact price point
but i think it's around 60 us so you'll
be interesting to see what creative put
together for that kind of price point i
actually use the creative h7s on a daily
basis and i love them so that remotely
like those i'd be pretty impressed the
design is very different as you can see
they're pretty white looks like there's
steel in there though feel sturdy pretty
comfy too I probably give these review
you guys can expect that in the next
week or so you can get a little carry
bag pretty good for a budget headset and
a detachable mine alright so I've got
one more box and I'm not entirely happy
because there will take please think of
my unboxing boxes episodes when you send
these boxes over I mean spoiler alert
it's a view 27 case Wow where's the
suspense thankfully it is a new product
and it's a pretty cool looking case so
you can expect a full review probably in
a couple of days and try and pump this
thing out so it does have something
pretty cool about it so I'm box now and
show you guys
so straight up you can see it's sort of
like a curved door the top so that's so
you can get a bird's-eye view of your
case as well and I expect it's going to
look pretty damn cool I'm actually bit
tempted to a hard to watercool building
this but we'll see if I have time I'll
show you guys how it opens but then
we'll take a calling this a Gullwing
door aka a billionaire door
unfortunately it does slide off like a
regular case or I wouldn't classify it
as an official gullwing thermaltake
billionaire doors that's what we want in
our cases listen to the people the most
satisfying part of any unboxing so
that's the thermaltake view 27 guys keep
your eyes peeled this week because I
will have a review of this coming out as
well as the other couple of products
that I've got on hand and there might
even be a GPU theme thing so keep your
eyes peeled check the channel and don't
forget my p.o box is in the description
below so send me some weird stuff
alright see you guys next week cheers
