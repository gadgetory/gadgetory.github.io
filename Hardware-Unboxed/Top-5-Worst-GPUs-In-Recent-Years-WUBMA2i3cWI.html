cpu video and for whatever reason you
guys seem to love the hell out of that
one I had a heap of requests through the
same with GPUs so today we're gonna see
what that looks like
remember this is just meant as a bit of
fun and if you have one of these GPUs
nestled away on your graphics card don't
be offended we're certainly not saying
you're stupid for buying what are
anything like that just meant as a bit
of fun so let's get into it
kick-starting the worst GPU pics I
decided to go mobile for mobile baby
some of you might have got that anyway
for the longest time now mobile gaming
has been pretty rubbish if I'm honest
and I am these latest efforts on that
front are about as ordinary as it gets
the Radeon RX 400 series actually
represented pretty good value on the
desktop though in comparison to NVIDIA
GeForce 10 series it wasn't the most
power efficient this sadly didn't bode
well for the Radeon RX m 400 series the
M of course indicating that this is a
mobile part the RX 470 was the budget
King on the desktop and it was really
the must have sub $200 GPU for laptops
though it was the must avoid at all
costs GPU the RX m 400 series proves so
bad for laptops that very few brands
even offered models supporting them as
just mentioned power consumption was the
key issue here and that causes a
knock-on effect for mobile parts that
destroys pretty much everything the poor
efficiency meant that aim des had to cut
the Radeon rx m4 70 X down to 896 stream
processors from the 2048 SP use of the
desktop part a massive 56% reduction
this method the mobile rx 470 performed
at best like a desktop rx 460 and if you
recall the 460 was embarrassingly slow
ultimately this meant that the Radeon m4
70 X ended up offering rx 460 light
performance with power consumption that
was comparable to that of this
significantly faster GTX 1060 so
laptops that used AMD solution were
thick layout and sadly much slower I
have to admit I had a seriously hard
time trying to work out which GPU I
should pull the trigger on for this
category I really wanted to only go back
a few years to keep the pics somewhat
relevant and I narrow it down to a few
options from both AMD and NVIDIA I ended
up those settling on the Radeon r9 285
the model that unveiled the GC and a
third generation architecture in late
2014 about a year after the original
Radeon 200 series cards were first
introduced there really are so many
reasons why I picked this GPU but I'd
say chief among which was just the
terrible timing of their release as I
said it was almost year after the first
200 series models arrived and that meant
that the r9 285 wasn't released till
September 2nd 2014 and it came at an
MSRP of 250 dollars u.s. back in 2014 I
wrapped up my review by saying this at
$249 the r9 285 doesn't exactly redefine
the landscape with only 4% more
performance on average than the car that
will be replacing the r9 280 even if you
discount the big loss and Tomb Raider
which could possibly be driver related
the on line 25 is still just 6% faster
than the r9 280 bringing a four to six
percent boost for the same price
obviously isn't bad but we're not sure
the i9 285 was completely necessary
either I also noted that the Sapphire
card was overclocked by 5% from factory
so that could inflate the scores by two
to three percent making the margin
between the r9 285 and r9 280 even
thinner the r9 285 did come with free
sync support though and enhanced DirectX
12 capabilities but at the same time
neither of those were terribly useful
back then another impossible even more
serious issue was the arrival soon
thereafter of the GeForce GTX 970 which
was released the same month and it
offered considerably more performance
for a mere 30% increase in price so
within the same month of its release the
r9 285 faced a serious price cut just to
remain relevant ultimately there really
was nothing wrong with the
to 85 perhaps the two gigabyte vram
buffer was questionable but the main
issue being that it was just released
too late in the game and came right
before the GTX 970 and of course even
before the GTX 970 arriver just didn't
change anything in the market and
ultimately disappointed with the latest
iteration of the gcn architecture it was
really a bit of a buzz killer you can
say it's hard to believe that the
GeForce GTX 780 series is roughly four
years old now that said though it is
really showing its age when compared to
the r9 390 the GTX 780 has certainly
slipped further behind today and it's no
secret now that the Kepler architecture
just hasn't aged well it's either down
to the architecture itself or in video
perhaps neglecting driver development or
maybe just a bit of both either way
we've never seen an Nvidia architecture
fall away quite like our Kepler house
Kepler also marked the birth of the
insane $1,000 Titan series and really
set the tone for in videos enthusiasts
boning tactics you know where they
release a $1,000 model and later that
year release a price that delivers
pretty much the same or perhaps even
better performance very much easier to
swallow price like what they did with
the GTX 780 Ti yep it has to be said the
GTX 780 Ti seemed like the ultimate gift
to high-end game is in late 2013 and
then by 2015 the ultimate curse today
the Kepler based GPUs have become so
nerfed in modern games they're really no
longer worth even buying you'd have to
pick up the once-mighty GTX 780 Ti for
pocket change to even consider it it's
really not a great deal fast in the GTX
1052 and a lot of modern titles but uses
around a hundred and fifty percent more
power thankfully though we are yet to
see a noticeable decline in performance
for the following generation the Maxwell
based stuff the GTX 970 980 and 980ti
still perform very well in modern titles
but as always we are keeping a close eye
on this stuff
well there were a few candidates for
this category but come on who's going to
dispute this pick the Pascal based Titan
range doesn't get any more confusing
strange bizarre than that
so in video world the world when they
announced an insane Titan X and I don't
mean the Maxwell based tight next in
2015 that was the GeForce GTX Titan X
I'm of course talking about the Nvidia
Titan X yeah the Pascal version okay so
confusingly on August 2nd 2016 we got a
second graphics card from a video to be
named Titan X since this was all very
confusing some of us reviewers decided
to rename the Pascal based Titan X to
the Titan XP XP was cool for a few
reasons obviously the P stands for
Pascal but XP or experience points is
also something you are rewarded with in
modern games you get enough XP and you
can level up so there's a bit of a fun
play on that so while a questionable and
still quite possibly dumb decision by
Nvidia's marketing team we all just
moved on and got on with the
benchmarking then a little over half a
year later in videos marketing team
decided to troll us all once again and
actually released a Titan XP can you
believe that well you probably can
because it happened like five months ago
now but still I mean the point is is it
really even stupidity at this point it
just seems like an obvious trolling
attempt to me Nvidia stylized it as
Titan X a little P and for a while there
we had the tight next big P and now we
had the little P I gave up on that
though it was a fun joke for a little
bit but it really just got too stupid
annoying to continue with anyway as it
turns out the Titan XP can only be
purchased through Nvidia for an
eye-watering $1200 us and it's really no
faster than a custom GTX 10 atti for
gaming
okay so wrapping things up it's time for
me to pick what I feel is the worst
reference card designed by either AMD or
Nvidia in the past few years to be
honest it might have actually been
easier to pick one that didn't just
flat-out suck though actually know that
that might have actually been harder
looking over my shortlist of candidates
I have to say there was definitely more
from AMD on that list than there was
from Nvidia don't get me wrong now in
video has had some shockers over the
years but with a much larger budget to
work with they've been largely able to
correct the poor designs of the past
plus they're now charging a price
premium for their reference card but
Founders Edition so it kind of seems
like cheating anyway we didn't have to
go too far back to find an AMD reference
cooler that doubles as a leaf blower
one of my favorite AMD GPUs of recent
memory was the Radeon r9 290 it was an
amazingly good value buy although I did
initially test the reference model back
in 2013 we still gave it an overall
score of 95 out of 100 one of the
highest scores would given a GPU at the
time that said though I did note that
far more results were less than
desirable and this added to my
anticipation of third-party designs the
r9 290 screamed like a jet but I was
confident board partner models would be
much better and indeed they were sadly
that was a long two-month wait before we
got quality board partner cards that
could tame the r9 290 unfortunately
rubbish reference designs are still the
bane of AMD's existence and they seem
unable to do anything about it money is
obviously a key issue here the RX 470
reference card design for example was
another abomination and Vega 64
air-cooled looks to be one of the worst
results yet we should probably just
start calling them aim D throttle card
designs now with automatic underclocking
to save your ears well I don't you guys
enjoyed that
I certainly had a lot of fun putting it
together of course please let me know
your thoughts on the pics and let me
know what your picks look like as always
love to hear your input also if you
happen to have a computer with an older
GPU maybe something Kepler based and you
want to upgrade then check out my new
upgrade my PC deeply series there's a
heap of fun and there's
always loads of cool prizes to be won so
make sure you check it out
I'm your host Steve see you again soon
