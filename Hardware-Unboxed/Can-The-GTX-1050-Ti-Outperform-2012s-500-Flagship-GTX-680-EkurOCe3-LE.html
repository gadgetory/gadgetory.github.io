unbox video for this one we have a bit
of an unusual comparison for you if you
owned one of these back in 2012 you
would have been pretty chuffed
this was Nvidia's flagship graphics card
at the time the GTX 680 it I packed
quite the punch it was fast enough to
dethrone the raid on HD 7970 but AMD did
of course fire back with a gigahertz
overclocked version of that card which
sort of pushed a little bit ahead but
anyway that's not the point of this
story recently when putting together a
massive titanfall 2 GPU comparison
featuring over 40 graphics cards
I noticed the new GTX 1052 I was
actually able to beat in videos 2012
flagship GPU on paper this doesn't seem
possible the GTX 680 features twice as
many cuda cores packs much more compute
performance and considerably more
bandwidth in fact for virtually every
comparison you can make the gtx 1050 Ti
is much slower the exception of course
being operating frequency officially the
1050 Ti is clocked a little over 30%
higher however we know that for the most
part the GP operates well above the
suggested 1392 megahertz boost frequency
our MSI card for example works at over
1.8 gigahertz for the most part making
it at least 70% faster in terms of
operating frequency we also know that
the GTX 680 is based on the Kepler
architecture and since then we have seen
quite a large improvement in performance
and efficiency most of which was
delivered by the previous Maxwell
generation probably the most interesting
fact here being that 4 years ago the 680
was released at $500 us or 684 us
Aussies
whereas today the 1050 Ti can be picked
up for just 140 us or 225 ozzie costing
around three and a half times less we
wonder can the 1050 Ti deliver a similar
level of performance to the 680 well
let's go find out first let's the other
to compare in the new titanfall 2 game
in the initial stages of our tests both
GPUs are able to push over 50 fps at
1080p but 1050 Ti is consistently faster
though and even pushes over 60 FPS at
times once we reach the cutscene though
the framerate takes a strong hit on both
GPUs tipping
down to the 40s performance he is
similar though the 1050 TI does still
stay ahead in the end the 680 drops as
low as 35 fps while the 1050 TI only
dipped 240 FPS on average the 1050 was
for 10% faster in this test averaging 50
fps to the 680 s 44 FPS might knock you
out you should be okay when you wake up
last the most hostile Titan sit down
apex predators copy that bTW mercenary
stay down good Wow
VP lifestyle
for some reason we're having issues
getting the river tuna over later sharp
and years of war for the in-game
statistics are quite small so you might
find them difficult to follow
nevertheless the minimum and average
frame rate results for both cards can be
found below but 1052 I only dropped down
to 52 FPS which was slightly higher than
the 50 fps the 680 drop to the average
frame rate was also quite similar the
1050 to I was just 3% faster here
for testing f1 2016 we use the ultra
quality settings with SMA I enabled the
in-game benchmark was used with the
heavy rain option enabled for years on
it's impressive to see that the GTX 680
can still deliver playable performance
here with the quality settings maxed out
still 2016 s low to mid range GTX 1050 -
I was a bit more punchy only dipping 238
FPS while averaging 48 fps
this made Nvidia's new budget GPU almost
12 percent faster than their
four-year-old flagship part
despite its age the GTX 680 still looks
to be fairly well optimized for as
arguably 2016 biggest first-person
shooter the 1052 I might have been 9%
faster on average but that still allowed
the 680 to deliver a very playable 53
FPS while it never dipped below 40 FPS
it's worth keeping in mind that we're
testing using the ultra quality preset
with tsaa enabled even at 1080p the game
looks absolutely amazing and it is hard
to believe that today PC gamers can
enjoy these kind of visuals and frame
rates on a hundred and forty dollar
graphics card
Bobby baby so slow
granted overwatch is in a demanding game
but we still really wanted to include it
because there aren't any new
technologies here that favor the newer
GT x 1050 TI as a result both GPUs
provided very similar performance both
only dropped as low as 79 FPS while the
1052 I was just 2% faster on average for
a negligible two frames per second
difference the game played extremely
well at tentative here using the ultra
quality settings because we test it with
bots enabled the runs aren't exactly the
same but over the length of the run they
seem to balance out quite well finally a
quick look at Mirror's Edge catalyst he
both GPUs delivered similar frame rates
though the GTX 1050 was 3% faster the
1052 I did maintain a slightly better
minimum frame rate as well here it was
7% faster and we believe this is mostly
down to the larger memory buffer that
said memory allocation on the 1050 Ti
didn't rise above 1.9 gigabyte whereas
it did on the 680 perhaps this is
evidence of pascal's improved memory
compression technology
the previous gameplay footage just seen
was recorded on our core i7 6700k test
system however these power consumption
results have been recorded using our
core i3 6100 t system the average load
power consumption results were taken
from the six games just tested while the
idle results have been reported after
ten minutes of idle at the Windows 10
desktop the gameplay footage shown here
is simply included for color and
movement in other words it's a cunning
ploy by us to try and keep you
interested in whatever it is we're
saying at the time so then looking at
the 1052 eye we see it pushed the core
i3 system to a total consumption of 116
watts very impressive stuff holy Batman
just check out the figures from the 680
though sucking down a total of 225 watts
made our core i3 rig look like a real
power peak this thing just isn't polar
bear friendly
that's more than a 90% increase in total
system power consumption well there you
have it to think that just four years
ago the GTX 680 was at the top of the
single GPU graphics card pile at a price
of 500 US dollars and today that same
level of performance or rather slightly
better performance can be had for just a
fraction of that price even this time
last year gamers were paying slightly
more for the GTX 950 and yet the 1050 Ti
is over 20% faster the little 1050 TI
isn't just significantly cheaper than
the 680 either it also consumes a
fraction of the power making it cooler
quieter and a little easier on your
power bill the 1050 TI really is an
awesome little graphics card and this is
what I said in my original review
however for a few extra fuel units you
might be able to learn something a lot
better and that will be the premise for
next week's upcoming video so keep your
eyes peeled for that one
finally from all of us here at harbor
unboxed I'm Steve you stay classy
