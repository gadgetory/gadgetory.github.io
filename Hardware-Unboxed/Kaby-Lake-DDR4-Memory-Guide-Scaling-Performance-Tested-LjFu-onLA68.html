unboxed today's video is all about
memory namely the ddr4 variety when it
comes to buying ddr4 memory there's a
few things you want to keep in mind such
as speed capacity latency and what was I
talking about again oh that's right
memory anyway for today's video I'm
going to assume you've taken the plunge
and by that I mean you've decided to buy
an Intel KB Lake processor perhaps
you're coming from a Sandy Bridge or
even an AMD FX processor well whatever
the case is for some crazy reason you've
decided to upgrade now and not wait for
amnesia Rison if that is the case then
ddr4 memory might be new to you as the
aforementioned platforms use the older
ddr3 memory standard so in this video
I'm going to show you what kind of ddr4
memory you should be on the hunt for
this guide will also apply for skylake
owners as well since kb lake and skylake
processors have pretty much the same
memory requirements the focus is really
going to be on memory frequency and
latency rather than capacity testing
capacity is kind of its own kettle of
fish if you will it really how much
memory you will require depends on the
rest of your system specifications and
probably more importantly what it is
that you plan on doing with the computer
as a rule of thumb in 2017 we would
suggest a minimum of eight gigabytes of
memory for gamers while 16 gigabytes
should be the new target 16 gigabyte
kits are actually better value anyway as
pricing starts at 70 us meanwhile the
cheapest dual channel 8 gigabyte kit
started about $45 as always it really
comes down to your budget if you're
going with a pentium or Core i3
processor then skimping on an 8 gigabyte
kit might make sense on that note if
you're buying a budget process or even
an ankh a core i5 slash i7 processor and
pairing it with a non z set that is to
say anything that isn't these e170 or z
270 then memory frequency becomes less
of an issue the h1 70 h1 10 and be 150
chipsets for example also for a maximum
ddr4 memory speed of just 20 133
megahertz
the h2 70 and b250 chipsets are also
memory frequency limited these six gen
Intel processors are again limited to 21
33 megahertz while the seventh gen
processors can use ddr4 2400 memory as a
side note ddr4 2133 memory doesn't
actually operate at 21 33 megahertz as
advertised by pretty much every
manufacturer and board partner as this
is double data rate memory it actually
operates at 1066 megahertz but rather
than be technical and go against the
grain we will submit to the marketing
lingo and just call it 21 33 megahertz
to avoid confusing anyone right so
assuming you have either a Zed 170 or z2
70 motherboard then there is going to be
a huge range of ddr4 memory speeds
available to you
speeds ranging from ddr4 2133 all out to
ddr4 4000 and even faster realistically
though you're really going to be
deciding between modules rated at 2400
megahertz to about 3400 megahertz
the other things to consider here are
the price and latency the latter of
which is often described as memory
timings
anyway giving us a clearer picture of
how timings and frequency impact
performance of the new cable 8
processors I have done a little
benchmarking before we jump to the game
results here's a quick look at the
impact memory frequency has on bandwidth
using ddr4 2133 memory we are limited to
twenty two point eight gigabytes per
second meanwhile moving to 2666 memory
the bandwidth increased by 21% we see a
further 20 percent bump in bandwidth
when jumping to the ddr4 3,600 memory
that said this sweet spot does appear to
be ddr4 3400 memory this is the last
test we're going to be looking at before
the gaming benchmarks I promise it's
interesting to see how the increased
bandwidth impacts performance in the
7-zip application although the gains are
consistent we only see a three percent
improvement in performance when jumping
all the way from ddr4 2133 memory to the
fastest memory tested ddr4 3600 so not
all applications will benefit greatly
from the increased memory bandwidth okay
so first that we have battlefield one
which we are testing with a Titan XP at
1080p we
deucey consistent gains as the memory
frequency increases though it has to be
said that there is just a 7% increase in
performance for the minimum frame rate
when going from ddr4 2133 all wipe the
ddr4 3600 another game I tested was Call
of Duty infinite warfare and
unfortunately it didn't become apparent
that there was a 125 FPS cap until I was
well into the testing since I had the
results I decided to include them anyway
as they could be useful once we move to
the 4k resolution finally the last game
I tested was Gears of War 4 which is
known to be a very demanding game on the
CPU here we see a reasonable 13% boost
in performance when going from ddr4 2133
to ddr4 3600 still I was using a Titan
XP here at 1080p so you do have to
wonder what the gains would be like
under more realistic conditions well
these numbers look quite different to
the battlefield 1 results in previously
here we see virtually no difference in
performance between the ddr4 2133 and
ddr4 3,600 memory when gaming with the
Titan XP at 4k Call of Duty infinite
warfare has now dropped down to 75 FPS
and while that is well below the 125 FPS
cap we previously saw increase in the
memory speed didn't improve the
framerate even in Gears of War 4 where
we previously saw a 13% performance
boost from the lowest clocked memory to
the fastest we now just see a three and
a half percent variation in performance
at 4k so the moment the GPU becomes the
performance limiting factor which is
almost always when gaming increased in
the CPUs memory bandwidth does little to
nothing to aid system performance for
the most part high-speed ddr4 isn't
really going to improve the gaming
experience perhaps those rocking a
higher refresh rate monitor might
benefit from the high memory frequency
but for everyone else it isn't really
necessary one last thing I just want to
look at briefly are memory timings as
you can see as the memory timings are
relaxed the memory balance slowly falls
away the impact timings have on
bandwidth isn't nearly as significant as
the frequency though from CL 16 to CL a
team we only see a 2% reduction in
bandwidth meanwhile previously we saw a
4% reduction when going from ddr4 3400
to 3200 and then from 3200 down to 2800
a reduction in bandwidth by further 7%
here we see well under a
one percent reduction in performance
when testing the various memory timings
using 7-zip finally using Gears of War 4
we see virtually no difference in
performance when tweaking the memory
timings so in the end memory timings and
frequency don't have a great impact on
gaming performance therefore it really
comes down to price given that there are
quite large bandwidth gains to be had
when going with faster memory I would
still recommend buying the fastest
memory possible I just don't recommend
hitting yourself with any kind of
serious price premium to get it for
example g.skill ripjaws for 16 gigabyte
dual-channel ddr2 NT 133 kit starts at
$85 u.s. but for five dollars more you
can purchase their Ripjaws v ddr4 3000
kid and for another five dollars lands
you the Ripjaws v ddr4 3200 kit beyond
that though things do start to get a bit
out of control the cheapest ddr4 3400
kit which is another Ripjaws v memory
kit cost $130 not outlandish but that's
almost a 40% premium over the ddr4 3200
stuff for no real gain as a side note
I'd just like to point out that g.skill
hasn't sponsored this video but they
have sent us a shipload of memory in the
past and with being so competitively
priced it works well for these examples
so in summary of pricing in your region
reflects what we just saw then I
recommend pairing your KB lake or
skylake processor with ddr4 3,000 to
3,250 we've used ddr4 3,200 memory in
our core i7 6700k test machine and it's
worked out very nicely I will provide
some links in the video description for
some memory over at Amazon I recommend
checking out anyway that's all from me
on this one
just remember get the fastest memory you
can while avoiding spending a huge
premium over the 2133 stuff I'm your
host Steve and I hope to catch you on
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
