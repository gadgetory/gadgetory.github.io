unboxed why am I talking like this I
don't know so let's just stop and get on
with today's review which happens to be
a review of as rocks fatalities in 270
gaming ITX / AC motherboard actually
that's the box here's the motherboard I
have to admit I do love mini ATX
motherboards designed for high-end
hardware they never seem to disappoint
when it comes to PC building I'm at my
happiest when I'm either building an
incredibly large system and something
like thermal takes the tower nine
hundred or something small in say
there's still verse own Raven RVs at O -
maybe it's just me but I find it very
satisfying building a high-end gaming
rig in something the size of a shoebox
and I'm not talking NBA player shoe box
here either
anyway as Rock snoozy 270 Mini ITX
motherboard looks to be the perfect
successor to their already great as it
170 version upgrades include Thunderbolt
3 support Intel octane technology
creative Sound Blaster cinema 3 audio
and better Wi-Fi integration of course
you still get features such as USB 3.1
and ultra m2 all of this is crammed into
a board measuring just 17 centimeters by
17 centimeters as was the case with the
previous model as rock has gone with a
black and red theme and this is common
amongst all their fatality branded
boards the majority of the board is
black with the exception of the dual
ddr4 dims and the heatsinks speaking of
which the board is surprisingly heavy
for its size and some of that is down to
the fact that the board's VRMs are
cooled via a rather thick heatsink which
is connected to a smaller heatsink over
the z170 chipset via a copper heat pipe
for the most part the board's design and
layout is excellent the power connectors
are conveniently placed at the edge of
the board along with the USB 3.0 header
and two of the six SATA 6 gigabits per
second ports there are also three for
pin fan headers all placed at the top of
the board for easy access the CPU socket
is reasonably clear well actually for a
small form-factor board there's loads of
clearance for those trying to stuff a
larger cooler into a mini ITX case
helping to tidy up the board layout is a
new Wi-Fi module previously asrock went
with a mini PCI Wi-Fi card using a real
tech controller which I felt was a bit
of an oversight had they used an m2 card
of the upgrade path would have been much
broader anyway not making the same
mistake twice we find an Intel dual
bound wireless AC 72-56 adapter
pre-installed this uses an MDOT to 2230
card supporting speeds at up to 867
megabits per second while it also
supports Bluetooth 4.0 flipping the
board over reveals an ultra m2 port
supporting the 22 60 and 20 to 80 form
factors m2 drives using either the SATA
or PCIe interface are supported PCIe
gen3 models can be fed up to 32 gigabits
per second of bandwidth please note
though if the m2 slot is occupied by a
SATA type m2 device then the first SATA
port will be disabled finally as you
would expect nvme SSDs are supported as
bhoot devices back on the front side of
the board you will find a real tech alc
1220 codec providing 7.1 channel HD
audio the implementation here does come
with a huge list of extra features
features such as the niche akan Feingold
series audio caps 120 decibel SNR DAC
with differential amplifier Ti any 5532
premium headset amplifier 4 front panel
connectivity supporting 600 ohm headsets
isolated PCB shielding individual PCB
layers for the right and left audio
channels gold audio connectors and
support for creative Sound Blaster
cinema 3 so that's a pretty impressive
audio solution for a mini ITX
motherboard so that pretty much covers
all the important features let's take a
look at that UEFI BIOS
upon entering the BIOS the easy mode
loads first and here you can find the
basic information and options such as
the processor type and frequency memory
related information and system vitals
such as the operating temperatures and
fan speeds for experienced users it is
possible to access the advanced bias by
hitting f6 alternatively for future you
can disable the easy mode and just
bypass it entirely
the main BIOS layout is very similar to
what we have seen from these dead ones
70 bowlers featuring a fatality theme
most of the fun will be had in the OC
Tweaker menu though there are some
useful things in the advanced and tool
menus as well when it came time to have
a clock I jumped into the OC Tweaker
menu set the CPU ratio to all core and
then raised the CPUs clock multiplier
from 42 to 49
after that I entered the voltage
configuration submenu and set the
voltage mode to fixed and then applied
1.33 volts
after that it was a simply a matter of
saving the changes and rebooting the
system now in Windows we had a 100%
stable overclock of 4.9 gigahertz on the
quad core Core i7 77 arcade processor
not bad for a little ATX motherboard
not bad at all finally I installed the
samsung SSD 960 pro 1 terabyte in the m2
port on the underside of the motherboard
and ran the a SSD benchmark the SSD
performed as expected providing a read
throughput of 2.8 gigabytes of a second
with a write throughput of 2.1 gigabytes
per second as for gaming performance so
this little mini ITX motherboard will
perform like any other z 270 or 170
motherboard and that's really true for
any 100 series or 200 series motherboard
actually that's a good size comparison
there for the two boards that's in focus
and in the shot nicely anyway for a long
time now the chipset and by extension
the motherboard haven't really been
performance defining bits of kit ever
since Intel released it was Sandy Bridge
back in 2011 all the functions of the
Northbridge now reside on the CPU things
like the memory controller which used to
impact performance and now all on the
CPU this means unless you're testing
multi GPU performance benchmarking your
motherboards gaming performance is a bit
pointless the other aspects of the Z 270
gaming ITX that I would have liked to
test are the audio and wireless
networking right now I don't have the
correct gear or a database of results to
compare with so this is something I'll
have to add down the track for now
though I think it's pretty clear that
this little asrock motherboard is
extremely capable I had no trouble
pushing the core i7 77 K to a 100%
stable overclock a 4.9 gigahertz and
this matches the best frequency we've
been able to achieve
this process here yet the SSD
performance was also very good I had no
trouble getting ddr4 3,600 memory to
work and that's the farthest memory I
have on hand right now though asrock
does state that the 4000 megahertz stuff
works just fine as well at the time of
putting this video together as rocks
said to 70 gaming I Texas yet to go on
sale the previous z170 model is selling
for 175 dollars u.s. so I feel like if
this one can come in for around that
price then it's going to be great value
overall I really do like this
motherboard and I can't think of
anything that I don't like or would
change maybe a second m2 port on the
back would be cool but I'm possibly
being a bit greedy with that one anyway
let me know what you guys think in the
comments I'm your host Steve and I'll
catch you on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
