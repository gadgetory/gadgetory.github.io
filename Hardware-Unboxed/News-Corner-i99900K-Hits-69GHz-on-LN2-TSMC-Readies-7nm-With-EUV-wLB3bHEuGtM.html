corner I guess that's plus we've covered
a massive amount of news so far this
week including everything Intel
announced at their processor launch and
recent fiasco involving principal
technology so there's definitely not as
much to cover in news corner this week
but there's still some interesting
things we haven't touched on so let's
get straight into it I guess the biggest
non Intel related news story this week
surrounds TSM C's 7 nanometer
manufacturing as I'm sure most of you
aware tsmc has been volume manufacturing
7 nanometer chips for around half a year
now including the Apple a12 Bionic SOC
for the latest iPhones and of course
we're set to get a whole suite of new
AMD products on seven nanometers shortly
including seven nanometer Vega for
compute cards next gen epic and of
course Zen too for consumer desktop but
TSMC are already moving on to the next
big step for seven nanometers which is
the introduction of extreme ultraviolet
or UV lithography which will be used for
elements of their seventh animated
production pipeline current seven
nanometer chips are manufactured using
deep ultraviolet lithography but the
move to a UV has been long waited in the
industry and is basically a requirement
to go smaller than seven nanometers so
TSMC are using it for non-critical
layers in a second generation seven
nanometer node called 7f f plus an
antique has a great article that
describes the more technical details of
7f f + + YT SMC are using a UV for this
node but it sounds like it will bring
small improvements over their first gen
7 nanometer node - to the limited use of
a UV there are no claims about
performance but we should expect 20%
higher transistor density and between 6
and 12 percent lower power consumption
relative to 1st gen 7 nanometer there
should be particularly handy for mobile
chips that need all the power savings
they can get TSMC has already taped out
the first chip built on their second
chance 7 nanometer node and they're also
planning to specialized it into another
process designed specifically for
automotive customers considering it's
already taped out it shouldn't be too
long before it moves into a high-volume
phase TSMC also provided an update on
their next generation
five nanometer node which is on track
for 2020 or thereabouts five nanometer
will use EUV on up to 14 layers which
should provide a handy booster density
and an 80% increase compared to their
first gen 7 an ohmmeter TSMC are also
predicting 15% more performance at the
same power or 20% lower power
consumption at the same performance risk
production of 5 nanometers is expected
to begin in April of 2019 so from what
TSMC is saying it sounds like they
aren't having any significant issues
with 7 nanometers or development on 5
enemies which is great news for the
future of hardware for both AMD and
NVIDIA who both rely on the company's
fabs this one is just for interest sake
more than anything Intel has managed to
overclock a core i 9 9900 k2 6.9
gigahertz on all course with the help of
liquid nitrogen and some extreme
overclocking experts until also claims
that hits 7.1 gigahertz all core and 7.4
gigahertz single core in their internal
testing and of course with further
tweaking we'll see those numbers client
post-launch
these figures don't tell us really
anything about how the 900k will fit in
overclocking a typical user will
actually be able to do with an air or
liquid cooler but it's interesting to
see what these chips are capable of in
the hands of professional overclockers
and certainly there's records being
broken for eight core CPUs there earlier
this week Microsoft completely stuffed
up the rollout of the Windows 10 October
2018 update otherwise known as version
1809 because Microsoft loves to use long
update names the update was supposed to
begin a wide rollout several days ago
but users choosing to update early we're
discovering that their files in My
Documents were being deleted during the
update process not everyone was
experiencing this issue but certainly a
small number of people were posting
about this on various places obviously
that's bad news so Microsoft decided to
pause the rollout for a couple of days
apparently plenty of windows insider
members had warned Microsoft of the
issue when testing beta versions of the
update months ago Microsoft chose to
ignore them well how was the huge
mistake on their part because the issue
reared its head during the public
rollout
seems pretty dumb with Microsoft to
ignore their beta test were saying maybe
they just assumed it was limited to a
small collection of testers anyway
Microsoft resumed the roller a couple of
days
with the issue fixed the company said
that 0.01% of users were affected which
is Kip guru points that could be around
700,000 users worldwide considering
Windows 10 700 million installed base
apparently the bug was caused by
something called known folder
redirection being confused with known
folder migration version 1809 was
supposed to clean up empty duplicate
known folders but end up deleting the
original folders instead thanks to this
confusion Microsoft says those that are
affected by the bug in the initial
rollout should contact customer support
because data recovery is still an option
IOC has renounced their free sync to hgr
monitor for the US market indicator
display is almost ready to ship for
those that are interested AAC first
announced the AG 322 QC four back in
April as a 27-inch 1440p 144 hertz
curved ova display sporting free sync to
HDR and display HDR 400 certification
without local dimming I don't think the
HDR experience will be all that flash
but at least with free sync to HDR
certification we know we're getting at
least 90 percent DCI p3 coverage for a
wider than standard color gamut the
monitor is already available in Europe
but we now know it'll be heading it to
the US for $550 on October 15 and that
seems like a fairly respectable price if
the HDR experience is at least slightly
or somewhat better than just basic SDR
microsoft are in the final stages of
acquiring game studio obsidian
entertainment according to a report from
kotaku you think the move will help them
bolster their lineup of exclusive Xbox /
PC tiles which is currently is
struggling to compete with the quality
of Sony's astonishing lineup to the ps4
and they're already shown they're
interested in acquiring game studios of
late they've already purchased
playground the studio behind it forts of
horizon and Ninja Theory who developed
hell-blade sinuous sacrifice obsidian
entertainment is best known for their
role-playing games including Knights of
the Old Republic - Fallout New Vegas and
more recently pillars of eternity 1 &amp;amp; 2
they almost went bankrupt a few years
ago as well so with the history of
making solid role-playing games would be
interesting to see what the studio could
cook up with a larger budget and the
of Microsoft certainly very exciting
times for that particular studio and
their games final story of the week I
guess this would be a short episode
concerning what I've covered so far
Microsoft has raised the price of
official Windows 10 home licenses from a
hundred dollars two hundred and forty
dollars on the Windows Store no idea why
they've made this change but they have
not that you should be buying licenses
through the Windows Store when you egg
and other retailers are still selling
official home Oh am case for the old a
hundred dollar price so definitely still
check out for those sort of official om
type deals Windows 10 Pro will still set
you back two hundred dollars and no we
don't recommend purchasing those sub $50
super dodgy windows keys from dodgy
online retailers that's it for this
week's news corner pretty much an entire
week of news on hardware unbox which has
been fun so we'll be back to some good
