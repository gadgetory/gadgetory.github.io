couple of weeks ago I looked at the
predator x34 P aces new top-end 34 inch
ultra wide display a while it's pretty
awesome the super high price tag of
$1,300 didn't make it all that
attractive to most of you guys out there
well today I'm looking at a similar
monitor from a soos that brings a very
similar experience for a lot less money
now when I say less money I don't mean
we're suddenly talking about $200
monitor however the Asuza ROG Strix XG
35 VQ does come in at $800 which is a
pretty enormous $500 difference compared
to the x34 P and we still get a lot of
the same features a 35 inch 34 40 by
1440 VA panel with an 1800 R curve a 100
Hertz refresh rate and free sync support
it doesn't have the slightly higher 120
Hertz refresh of the x34 P nor does it
have G sync but otherwise we're looking
at a similar experience for gaming and
if you haven't gained on a 21:9
ultra-wide monitor
I reckon you're missing out is this sort
of display is my personal favorite
throw in the 1440p class resolution and
a hundred Hertz refresh and provided you
have a powerful enough system you truly
get a high end visual experience with
something like the XG 35 V Q anyway
enough about ultra wide gaming let's
take a closer look at this monitor a
sous does a lot of box-ticking here with
the design and features the stand
supports a wide range of motion
including height swivel and tilt adjust
and there's visa mount compatibility for
those of you that like to wall mount
your monitors the on-screen display is
controlled through a directional toggle
on the rear as well which makes
navigation easy there's plenty of
connectivity - including hdmi 2.0 a
separate hdmi 1.4 port DisplayPort 1.2
and a 2 port USB hub I could give or
take the aesthetics here a soos tends to
use fairly aggressive gamer style on the
rog monitors with red highlights on the
stand and an interesting pattern
and back to say the least there's even
an RGB ring on the back with Aurra sing
support which doesn't make a lot of
sense on the monitor but a soos is just
hitting all those marketing buzzwords
and I guess the RGB display on the front
isn't enough RGB four monitors these
days the bezel size here is quite good
under nine millimeters on the top and
sides along with a fairly chunky twenty
nine mil bezel on the bottom which seems
normal for these sort of ultra wide
displays and the 1800 R curve is
noticeable though it does help make the
edges of the display appear slightly
more in your field of view when gaming
on a 16:9 display I do prefer a flat
panel but on a 21-9 display I think the
curve works I'm not going to spend a lot
of time the on screen display features
you've probably seen it all before
especially if you've used in a sous
minor or really any gaming monitor made
in the last few years on one of the
stuff is very familiar there are cheap
features like crosshairs included here
which is soos neatly caused a practice
mode along with things like low blue
light modes adaptive contrast and even
picture-in-picture one of the more
useful additions is a LMB or extreme low
motion blur which strobes the backlight
to match the refresh rate reducing
motion blur toning on this feature
causes a massive hit to display
brightness and picture quality but the
extra clarity and apparent sharpness you
know it could help in those fast paced
shooters turning on a LMB will disable
free sync though so it's not for
everyone
speaking of free sync obviously one of
the reasons this mono is more affordable
is it uses free sync over g-sync so it's
better suited to AMD GPU owners or those
who don't care about adaptive sync our
free sync monitors can be a bit hit or
miss as free sync lacks the vigorous
certifications to gsync this particular
free sleep display supports key features
like low framerate compensation as the
refresh rate range is large enough so
let's look at some of these specs our
soos list for this model and how close
the panel actually gets when it comes to
brightness a soos lists 300 nits and in
my testing it quite comfortably hits
this with the peak level of 358 nits in
my testing there's no local dimming or
HDR support here so the maximum
brightness is consistent no matter how
much white is on the panel at any
time soos lists a contrast ratio of
2,500 to one which is standard for
aviary a panel are one of the key
advantages of this technology over to
IPS or TN in my testing I measured
twenty to thirty nine to one by default
which falls a little short here but is
decent enough for an LCD and this
contrast ratio is well held throughout
the brightness range all the way down to
sixty tuned it's the lowest brightness
supported the one downside to VI panels
tend to be their response times which
are soos rate that formula second grade
to gray well I don't have the gear to
test response times just yet it's
definitely something I'm looking into
the wonderful guys over at EFT central
suggest the XG 35 EQ is slightly slower
on average than IPS based ultra wise
with similar specs definitely not by a
huge amount but it's something to keep
in mind if you really value your
response times on the other hand you do
get great viewing angles but again not
quite as good as the IPS based
alternatives as for uniformly the
actually 35 v/q unfortunately falls into
the same bracket as a lot of other curve
displays and that it's reasonably poor
in this area with the new seven by five
test grid for uniformity we can clearly
see the edges of the panel's deviate
significantly from the center with Delta
e values over five point zero in some
cases when viewing solid colors are an
all white background
these problems are somewhat noticeable
but it's not unique to this panel almost
every curve display I've tested suffers
in the same way power consumption as a
brief note is decent when calibrated to
200 nits of brightness the panel uses
just 45 watts of juice though that does
increase to over 60 watt at maximum
brightness levels so let's talk about
color performance by default the XG 35
EQ is set to 314 it's of brightness so
it's pretty high for normal usage
grayscale performance is good though
with a default Delta a average of 2.25
and an okay though not fantastic CCT
average of seven 140k and gamma Joshua
of 2.1 I've seen better grayscale
calibration out of the box but this
isn't a bad result from a gaming display
saturation results are good with a delta
a of one point eight eight and this
follows through to the color checker
with a delta a of two point three one
for the best results I'd be looking for
sub 1.0 results as always but anything
around that 2.0 mark is still classified
as good and as advertised the hg 35 vq
does support basically a hundred percent
srgb coverage which is the bare minimum
for displays these days as always a few
OSD tweaks can improve the experience
I'd ignore the garbage sRGB mode
entirely and stick purely to manual
tweak see the changes I made you can see
here and it's all fairly standard stuff
though of course there is natural
variance between displays you know the
settings I'm listening here might not be
the best for everyone
aside from correcting the brightness
these changes only made a minor
difference to performance with most of
the improvements coming in grayscale and
that's you know fairly standard stuff
for OSD only calibration the Delta II
average is now down at one point eight
zero and the CCT is fixed somewhat
though you can see in the curve of the
graph that this is never going to be
fully sold without proper calibration
saturation and color checker results are
largely unchanged as a result however
you can achieve excellent performance
with the full display calibration
through spectra Cal's Kalman 5 with only
a small hit of the contrast ratio now
2098 2:1 grayscale performance improved
to an excellent Delta II under 0.5 and a
CC T average basically dead accurate
gamma as well sits at a very solid level
so when looking at the saturation and
color checker results you can see that
calibration is pulled in these figures
to a sub 1.0 Delta e and even a maximum
Delta of just one point six seven which
is really good here of course for color
accurate usage the uniformity of this
display does hold it back from being
suitable for professional work and
software calibration profiles aren't an
ideal way to solve accuracy issues but
for a gaming focus monitor a few tweaks
can really lead to excellent results and
that's always great to see however this
really is a killer for this display my
review unit of this monitor did ship
with a single dead pixel in the middle
of the panel I have no idea how common
this is among all extra 35v cues out
there but it's rare for me to buy or
even review a monitor with a dead pixel
so make of that what you will assuming
you don't get an extra 35 VQ with the
dead pixel I think this model is a
pretty
solid buy it packs nearly all the
features you'd want from a high-end
monitor of this shape and size at a
price that's among the cheapest from a
major brand for the specs the build
quality is great if the design is a
little too game of my tastes while the
performance is solid with acceptable
out-of-the-box colors and plenty of room
for elite calibration the only real
complaint I have is with the display
uniformity which is a problem with a lot
of curve - and obviously the dead pixel
was a problem as well but
I hope almost all buyers wouldn't have
to face that problem so in general I
would think that you should keep this
more in mind if 34 40 by 1440 ultra wide
gaming is your thing particularly if you
have an AMD graphics card if you're
interested in grabbing an extra 35 V Q
or interested in exploring similar
