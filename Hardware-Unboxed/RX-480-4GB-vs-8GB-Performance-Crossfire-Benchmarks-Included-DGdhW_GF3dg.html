finally landed the mid-range radiant rx
for eighty year and there's been a lot
of controversies surrounding the release
some that has to do with expectations
not quite being met as well as the PCI
Express power over drawer Fiasco I'm not
going to touch on the over drawing issue
in this video well probably at all is
this will be corrected by md's board
partners and frankly I think the issue
has been blown well out of proportion
when I reviewed the R X 480 it was found
to deliver the best bang for your buck
of any GPU in the sub $300 price range
although it didn't rewrite the book on
value gaming it did manage to edge out
even those heavily discounted GTX 970
cards still I couldn't help but feel the
arcs forehead he wasn't being shown in
the best possible light why some
reviewers the 20% more expensive a
gigabyte model when it's unlikely to
deliver any performance advantage over
the 4 gigabyte model this really hurts
the cost per frame ratio of the our X
480 and I couldn't understand why AMD
would do this as I said in my review
I've tested the 4 gigabyte 290 X and a
gigabyte 390x clock the clock
extensively I found almost no difference
between the two under playable
conditions so why would the slightly
slower R X 480 be any different I don't
think it will be and if that's correct
it just adds to my confusion surely am
deer aware of this and want to show
their new GPU off in the best possible
light not only paying more for extra
memory you can't use but that extra
memory is still consuming power hurting
the RX 480 is efficiency so my plan then
was to get my hands on a pair of 4
gigabyte our X 480 s as soon as possible
for lengthy benchmark session sadly
everywhere I tried told me there are at
least three weeks away from stock of the
4 gigabyte cards nandi themselves didn't
have anything on hand either
in fact reports are coming in that those
who have managed to get their hands on a
4 gigabyte model have actually received
an 8 gigabyte card with half the memory
disabled in the BIOS this seems odd and
it's highly doubtful that AMD will keep
delivering 4 gigabyte models that
physically have eight gigabytes onboard
chances are this was a last-minute
decision to get some cheaper 4 gigabyte
cards to the market after all AMD touted
the RX 480 is a $200 part the good news
is rather than having to wait three or
more weeks to show you how our X 480
handles
just four gigabytes of vram available
AMD has provided me with the 4 gigabyte
bios this allowed me to flash my 8
gigabyte cards turning them into 4
gigabyte models by disabling half the
onboard memory and of course I can flash
them back enabling all the memory once
I'm done so while I don't have an
official 4 gigabyte rx4 ID I can
accurately show you how the 4 gigabyte
models will perform in both a single
card and crossfire configuration it's
worth noting that the memory spec for
the 4 gigabyte model sees the memory
clocked at no less than 17 50 megahertz
whereas the 8 gigabyte cards have to be
clocked at at least 2000 megahertz AMD
cyborg partners can use the faster eight
gigabit per second memory on their 4
gigabyte models if they choose and we
suspect many custom cards will feature
the higher clocked memory therefore
we've tested using the 8 gigabyte memory
spec on our 4 gigabyte bias as well as
usual my standard GPU testing rigor we
use and the full specs can be found in
the description I'll also be using
reference cards clocked at their default
specification unless stated otherwise
testing will take place at 1440p and 4k
so let's go on with it first up we have
battlefield 4 at 1440p we see no
difference between the 4 gigabyte
megabyte models and either a single card
or crossfire configuration increasing
the resolution to 4k changes nothing
again the 4 gigabyte version of the RX
480 is able to deliver the exact same
performance seen previously by the APU
bike cards
Far Cry primal with the HD texture pack
enabled didn't see any real difference
in the single card comparison enabling
crossfire did favor the 8 gigabyte card
by 2 fps though we would allow for a 1 2
FPS margin of error now at 4k we find no
difference between the 4 gigabyte and 8
gigabyte cards in Far Cry primal Star
Wars Battlefront shows the same result
seen so far in the previous two games at
1440p upping the resolution to 4k
doesn't change anything the 4 gigabyte
cards still match the 8 gigabyte models
the graphically intense rise of the Tomb
Raider also fails to show a difference
between the memory capacities even at 4k
we see the exact same performance
between the RX 4 80 with 4 gigabytes and
a gigabytes of memory available the
highest possible quality settings aren't
being used in Grand Theft Auto 5 as MSAA
and the advanced graphical settings are
disabled even so we wouldn't expect the
8 gigabyte models have an advantage in
this title given what we've seen
previously now at 4k the average frame
rate of the crossfire cards drops to
60fps this is the same
all for the four gigabyte and a gigabyte
cards Middle Earth shadow of Mordor is
famously known as being a bit of a VRAM
Pig and yet we see no difference between
their four gigabyte and a gigabyte
configurations of the rx 480 at 1440p
going to 4k changes nothing again the 4
gigabyte and 8 gigabyte configurations
provide the same results
overwatch isn't a particularly demanding
title so we certainly didn't expect to
find a difference here and well we
didn't still it is a new and very
popular game so I thought it'd be worth
including although the average frame
rate for the crossfire cards dips below
60 fps of 4k there's still no difference
between the 4 gigabyte and Anki gabite
configurations here
total war Warhammer is a new addition to
our benchmarking the games been tested
using DirectX 11 as the DirectX 12 mode
is still in the beta phase this is
another game that's known to eat up
memory and get at 1440p we see no
performance difference between the 4
gigabyte and a gigabyte our X 480
configurations moving to 4k we find
unplayable performance for the most part
and despite that the 4 gigabyte cards
hang in there Mirror's Edge catalyst is
another new title we've included sadly
crossfire support doesn't exist yet but
we can see that the single card for
gigabyte naked bar configurations
provided the same 46 FPS of 1440p using
the ultra quality preset please no
testing was conducted with the GPU
memory restriction feature disabled
moving to 4k drops the frame rate of the
RX 480 for gigabyte 9 gigabyte cards to
unplayable levels the eight gigabyte
version was 3 FPS faster here but
frankly with an average of 23 FPS it
doesn't really matter
Mirror's Edge catalyst has a hyper
quality setting which does turn the game
into an insane memory hog hyper cranks
are pretty much everything to the next
level though truth be told the visual
difference between the ultra and hyper
settings isn't exactly night and day
whereas the performance is most notable
of the improved shadows reflections and
lighting but again the game doesn't look
drastically different and for the most
part you'll have a hard time spotting
the difference anyway the reason I'm
showing the hyper results is because
they do show a serious difference
between the 4 gigabyte and a gigabyte
models here the a gigabyte model with
60% faster which is obviously very
significant that said the a key gimmick
model is also 30% slower with the hyper
quality settings when compared to the
ultra performance so I doubt it's
worthwhile playing at just 32 FPS to
show off that larger memory buffer well
there you have it a quick
in game comparison comparing the 4
gigabyte an 8 gigabyte rx 480 in both
single card and crossfire configurations
I've avoided including power consumption
results as they could be misleading
although 4 gigabytes of the total a
gigabyte buffer has been disabled the
memory chips are still physically there
and could result in higher than expected
consumption so for that reason I'll
again wait until I have an actual 4
gigabyte card in hand before providing
power consumption results so moving on
there was really only a single instance
where a gigabytes of vram showed any
kind of advantage over 4 gigabytes and
that was of course Mirror's Edge
catalyst using the hyper quality
settings
sadly the performance was so diminished
by this demanding setting that the
advantage of the 8 gigabyte card was
pretty well null and void that said this
could have become a real advantage of
crossfire was working this game still
for the most part the larger 8 gigabyte
memory buffer makes no difference at all
even when utilizing 2 cards in crossfire
this is honestly what I suspect it would
be the case so it makes Amy's choice to
send reviewers the more expensive a
gigabyte model even more confusing at
240 dollars the RX 480 comes to the cost
of $2 96 per frame based on our results
had we been sent to $200 for gigabyte
model that cost drops to $2 46th and our
scatter plot would have looked like this
essentially what that means is the arcs
480 would have been by far the best
value GPU on the market my conclusion
would have been a lot more positive
thankfully once I managed to get my
hands on a retail 4 gigabyte card from a
board partner I should be able to create
the radiant our X 480 review that should
have been what did you guys think of
these results was what you're expecting
