strict graphics card on hand for review
since I'm a bit late to the party with
this one I thought I'd do something a
little different rather than just
created on the 1070 review video why not
compare the Strix is one of the most
popular gtx 1070 cards i've reviewed to
date the gigabyte gtx 1070 extreme
gaming both the extreme gaming and the
ROG Strix are the biggest baddest
air-cooled GTX 10 70s edge company makes
so which is the best in an effort to try
and answer that question I'll be
comparing the out-of-the-box performance
maximum overclocked performance thermals
power consumption and overall design so
let's get to it compare these bad boys
side-by-side it really goes without
saying that these are both incredibly
awesome looking graphics cards they're
both predominantly black which means
they should look right at home in most
builds first off let's discuss the
dimensions and weight the extreme gaming
is the physically larger card
despite being slightly shorter 289
millimeters long this is 298 millimeters
for the Strix the extreme gaming is also
much heavier around temps and heavier in
fact as it weighs 1147 grams as opposed
to 1045 grams for the Strix card both
graphics cards have been given a little
extra high to facilitate the PCB and
cooling upgrades the gigabyte card
stands 138 millimeters tall by the sous
model is slightly shorter at 134
millimeters
the biggest difference can be found when
looking at the cards girth the extreme
gaming is a bit of a fatty spanning
three slots of 56 millimeters thick the
Strix however has been crunching those
megahertz keeping it nice and trim at
just 40 millimeters wide some 29%
slimmer both cards employ a triple fan
configuration though there are a few key
differences in the implementation if you
watch my extreme gaming review you'll
know that gigabyte managed to squeeze in
3 100 millimeter fans on a card that
measures less than 300 millimeters long
using their new win 4 stack 3x design
they achieve this by overlapping the
fans and to avoid any unwanted
turbulence they include a counter
rotating center fan the asustor xcu
three design is much more simple there
aren't any overlapping counter rotating
fans here instead you'll find a basic
3/4
and layout using a trio of 90 millimeter
fans still it's not all bland and boring
Isis does claim that their fans are
quite special by using the company's
patented triple wing blade technology
the tip of each blade features the
little wing lid on the underside this is
said to increase the air pressure at the
edge of the fan blade and therefore
maximize airflow and suit claims the
design generates 105 percent static
pressure over the heatsink
of course gigabyte make their own
groundbreaking fan blade design claims
with their triangle fan edge gigabyte
says this edge combined with their 3d
stripe curve on the fan surface enhance
the airflow by 23 percent over the
traditional fans gigabyte also uses a
double ball bearing structure for
improved longevity and quieter operation
it'll be interesting to see how the fan
designs compare in the real world of
course the airflow is just part of the
equation you have to extract the heat
first and doing just that are two very
large heat sinks again the extreme
gaming uses what looks and feels like a
much larger cooler the gigabyte cooler
way 791 grams meaning the cooler makes
up almost 70% of the cards total weight
this also means it weighs twenty percent
more than the cooler found on the asou
Strix card which is pretty shocking the
streaks cool away is 658 grams which is
a little over 60% of the cards total
weight so you're definitely getting much
more metal for your money with the
extreme gaming which can be seen as both
a positive and a negative depending on
your point of view from a positive
aspect it should mean superior cooling
performance for the gigabyte card the
negative though being this is a bigger
bulkier heavier product which could
cause unnecessary load on the
motherboard for those that move their
system around apart from the physical
size difference the design of the
coolers is fairly similar both employ a
number of heat pipes connecting to two
separate series of aluminium fans assume
studs use direct contact copper heat
pipes for the base whereas gigabyte has
gone for a separate solid copper base
moving on to the PCB designs we find two
very high quality products
gigabyte is gone with an extreme 10 plus
to power phase design while a soos is
gone with a more typical six plus one
phase design that said Asus uses their
super alloy power to components and I
mean check out the logo on those jokes
they have to be good right seriously
though a soos is claiming that these new
chokes are two times quieter than the
previous designs which significantly
reduces the buzzing noises
from the graphics card which design is
better I really have no idea but I will
be keeping an ear out for coil whine
noses along with what appears to be the
more extreme vrm design gigabyte has
also added in an additional 6 pin PCI
your power connector although Zeus is
stuck with a standard single 8 pin PCIe
connector something interesting on the
Strix card is a feature called fan
connect this is essentially a pair of 4
pin fan headers the Lau users connect
their case fans to the graphics card
allowing them to be controlled by the
GPUs temperature rather than the CPUs
gigabyte on the other hand has included
a pair of HDMI outputs here for VR mode
these provide convenient access for
front mounted VR modules and this stuff
each are not found on the Strix card so
that is a feature worth noting for those
planning on using their 1070 with a VR
headset okay so now we've taken a pretty
good look at these gtx 1070 s now let's
check the clock speeds before jumping
into the benchmarks the out-of-the-box
speeds see the gigabyte model operating
of slightly higher frequencies when
compared to the asou Strix card the
extreme gaming is clocked at 2% higher
while it's gddr5 memory operates at 28%
faster this then should give gigabyte
the advantage when comparing a stock
performance when manually overclocked
both achieved a base clock of well over
1.8 gigahertz the gigabyte card manage
18 44 megahertz while the asou spent a
bit higher at 1865 megahertz
although the Strix card did achieve the
higher overclock this isn't conclusive
evidence that a soos will win every time
sadly it's only feasible for me to test
a single card from each company so let's
get into the results first up we have an
old favorite battlefield 4 here the
extreme gaming averaged 94 FPS making it
just a single frame faster than the
Strix card which is within the margin of
error overclocked asou starts hit the
lead as their Strix model outperformed
the extreme gaming by 3 fps we find much
the same when testing with Far Cry
primal the extreme gaming is slightly
faster out of the box though with just 1
FPS in it and the same 56 FPS minimum we
can safely call this a tire
overclocked to fun once again the
performance is much the same this time
SUSE came out on top by single frame
since we've established that out of the
box and custom overclocks the
performance of these two graphics cards
is virtually identical star wars
battlefront is going to be the last game
we look at here the asou Strix is 1 FPS
slower out of the box
two FPS faster once overclocked so again
very similar to what was seen when
testing with battlefield 4 and Far Cry
primal these two graphics cards were
again evenly matched when comparing
power consumption the gigabyte extreme
gaming allowed for a total system
consumption of 249 watts while the
assist Strix card was slightly higher at
251 watts the margin grew once
overclocked with both customer clock
graphics cards consuming slightly more
power than the GTX 1080 found addition
we know gigabytes extreme gaming
features a much bigger beefier cooler so
it's not hugely surprising that it ran
cooler that said the massive cooler
allowed the card to run just a single
degree cooler than the Isuzu Strix model
both cards are extremely impressive here
operating at or below 60 degrees on the
gaming load overclocked to the extreme
gaming only hit 61 degrees while the
asou Strix card is 63 degrees again
impressive results for both products in
terms of volume I don't have any
scientific data but both graphics card
remain very quiet even when overclocked
right then so which one is better
well performance wise they're much the
same out of the box and customer
overclocked
the SU Strix car came out slightly ahead
in the overclocking though the numbers
are likely to vary slightly from card to
card
they both consume similar levels of
power and even delivered similar
operating temperatures design wise
they're both excellent and naturally
being a stinky goodbye products the
build quality is certainly there for me
the noteworthy differences come down to
the physical size of the cards and
ultimately the price the extreme gaming
is slightly shorter though it's the
width that will be of most concern
especially if you plan on going s align
the triple slot design of the 1070 makes
it a tight fit in SLI and the primary
card does get a little starved of fresh
air
the asou Strix card on the other hand
features the dual slide design so it's a
little more accommodating when it comes
to multi-gpu setups so that's a lie bit
of little interests that'll really come
down to which car do you think looks
best when comparing the designs of
course the biggest deciding factor is
the price and right now Seuss books have
a significant advantage here down under
you can expect to pay 800 ozzie dollars
for the gigabyte gtx 1070 extreme gaming
while the suit's gtx 1070 ROG Strix is
fetching a more wallet friendly 730
dollars stateside the assuage card is
selling for 460
I'm creating this video I couldn't
locate the extreme at a US retailer so
when it boils down to it the assist gtx
1070 r EG Strix is the better value
option have they been evenly priced I
have no idea which one I would pick
they're both really exceptional products
