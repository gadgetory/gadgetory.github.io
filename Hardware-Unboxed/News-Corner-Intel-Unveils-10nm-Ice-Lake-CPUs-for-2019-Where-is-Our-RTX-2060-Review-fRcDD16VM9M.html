corner in this special CES edition again
we're not actually at CES in Las Vegas
because neither Steve are over I guess
really all that keen on flying to the US
for a massive crowded trade show but
that hasn't stopped us from covering
some of the bigger releases to come out
so far in today's episode of news corner
we'll be running through what we think
are some of the more exciting
announcements and releases so far and a
quick summary and then later in the week
we'll probably have another episode
talking about everything else it has
been showing off throughout the show and
of course Amy's keynote is yet to come
and we'll have a special video for that
as well
first up there there is something I
wanted to address quickly we've had
loads of comments asking us where our
g-force r-tx 2060 review is you might
have seen our video talking about the
announcement yesterday but shortly after
that video went live the NBA for reviews
lifted and ours wasn't among them Steve
called me this morning and well I think
it's safe to say he was absolutely
furious at the situation it seems like
NVIDIA has screwed us big time on this
one we're not sure why we're currently
following up with them to see what the
deal is here and we'll have more to talk
about this issue probably in a video
tomorrow as for our review at this stage
expected around or after the actual
launch where we'll look at board partner
cards potentially in a big GPU
comparison like we were hoping to get up
around the actual NBA date for reviews
but so if I haven't been able to do so
we've you know we'd love to be talking
about the RX 2060 yourself instead of
talking about how Nvidia is handled is
launched with us but unfortunately we
don't have a card right now so more to
come on this alright some of the real
news topics first up we have a bunch of
announcements out of Intel's keynote
address a number of the announcements
centered around Intel's data center 5g
and automotive products which we won't
be covering here but we did still get
some juicy information about upcoming 10
nanometer products the first consumer 10
nanometer product from Intel will be ice
Lake which is expected to launch in
volume in holiday 2019 which basically
refers to the fourth quarter of the year
ice Lake will initially consist of 15
watt notebook processors in Intel's new
series with
no word on any future product lineup so
if you're waiting for 10 animated
desktop CPUs from Intel that will be
sometime later ice Lake you series base
design consists of four sunny Cove CPU
cores with eight threads in addition to
gt2 Gen eleven graphics while the CPU
core count isn't improving at least for
this initial design over what Intel is
already providing with 8th gen you
serious parts the improvement to the GPU
site is massive gt2 graphics goes from
24 execution units up to 64 execution
units with Intel saying this is their
first standard GPU to pack more than 1
teraflop of compute performance to get
this extra graphics performance more die
space than usual is being allocated to
the GPU clock speeds haven't been
divulged this early so we have I guess
no real indication of how the CPU will
perform that's not surprising
considering the launch is still quite
far away that said Intel did say that
memory bandwidth has been increased up
to around the 50 gigabytes per second
mark to accommodate the new GPU so we're
looking at a relatively fast lpddr4 X
implementation there's also built-in
Thunderbolt 3 Wi-Fi 6 which is
previously known as Aero 2.11 a X and
4th gen image processing units on top of
this Intel have optimized power
consumption and are expecting to see
laptop designs with over 25 hours of
battery life metric which I guess is
always a bit meaningless without an
actual benchmark comparison the other
big announcement from CES was Lakefield
Intel's new low-power SOC designers
built using their father Oz 3d packaging
technology Lakefield is a combination of
a single big sunny Cove CPU core with 4
smaller awesome cause on 10 nanometers
with an overall package size of just 12
square millimetres Lakefield has several
layers in the stack including D Ram at
the top the CPU cores in the middle and
the i/o in the interposed beneath this
allows for a tiny board design which
until showed off as around the same size
as five u.s. quarters they expect
Lakefield to be utilized in 11 inch or
smaller form factors Intel also briefly
announced six new desktop ninth gen CPUs
those are the i9 1900 KF i7 9700 KF I
596 hundra
KF i 590 400 i 590 400 f and i 390 350 k
f5 of the new parts are f-series models
so they don't include integrated
graphics but other than that there are
no spec differences compared to the non
f models so for example the 9900 KF has
exactly the same core count and clock
speeds as the 9900 k just has no i GPU
the more interesting of the new SKUs are
the 6 core 6 thread core i5 90 490 400f
these CPUs are clocked marginally higher
than the core i5 8400 with a hundred
megahertz boosts to the base and boost
clocks now coming in at 2.9 gigahertz
and 4.1 gigahertz respectively the i5
9400 has a volume price of 182 dollars
the core i3 9350 KF is basically an 80
350 K except it now has turbo
functionality with the top clock of 4.6
gigahertz it's still a quad core with
that hyper threading though we can also
expect knife generation mobile CPUs in
q2 again no further details but this is
probably going to be a series of new
eighth series SKUs those really the main
announcements from Intel at CES in the
consumer side it's pretty unusual for
Intel to come out and talk about future
products it's early they've typically
not given road map updates but there
seems to have been a bit of an internal
shift in how they want to approach these
launches it's good to see 10 nanometers
on track for the end of 2019 as well
which fits in with their usual launch
time for new products I was going to
spend a bit of time in this next section
looking over the new GeForce artex
laptop announcements but really they're
not very exciting lots of very similar
designs as we've seen in the past just
with ID CX GPUs inside it definitely is
cool to see laptops get a bump in power
with the same sort of form factors
especially with the introduction of the
RT X 2080 but yeah not a lot of exciting
products I do want to point out two
designs though that I thought were a bit
unusual the first is the Acer predator
triton 900 a 2 in 1 laptop that was
first shown as a concept at Aoife in
2018 well it's apparently as coming as a
real product now for about 4000
toughness I don't really know why you'd
want a two-in-one gaming laptop because
this thing is certainly much heavier
than your typical two-in-one altra
portable but if you do find a use case
for something like this Acer we'll give
you a 17 inch 4k IPS 2
the flips around to a tablet like
configuration internally it packs an
Intel eighth generation Christ seven
processor and one of invidious new
laptop RTX 2080s the other one perhaps
isn't a laptop it's the rog mothership i
guess would you cast this as a tablet or
as a portable desktop pc not really sure
about that one
anyway it's basically designed like
Microsoft Surface pro except it's way
bigger with a 17 inch 1080p 144 Hertz
display and way heavier and way thicker
it's also way more powerful with an RT X
2080 inside and a crown 989 50 HK CPU it
looks completely ridiculous but hey it's
an interesting new product that will be
available in q1 though there's no price
for it right now
HP has finally launched the first of
invidious big format gaming displays the
omen X Imperium so this is a completely
ridiculous gaming display that is
basically just a TV I'm not really sure
how many people will actually be using
something so massive as a monitor but
for those that like to pair I guess a
powerful PC with their TV in their
living room this could be for you it's a
65 inch amv a 4k panel with a 120 Hertz
refresh rate that can be overclocked up
to 144 Hertz it's also giving you proper
HDR with up to 1000 nits of peak
brightness and a 384 zone F Ald
backlight plus there's 95% DCI p3 color
space support and a 120 watt sound bar
is bundled with the TV as well the real
kicker here though is the price tag
$5,000 with the release date of late
February while you are getting I guess
144 Hertz TV with HDR and gsync this is
an extremely high price tag for example
LG's 65 inch c8 OLED is about $3,000 and
it's an excellent TV for HDR The Omen X
Imperium would have to be bloody amazing
to justify its price tag considering
what sort of older TVs you can buy for
this price on a more reasonable note a
soos announced three new ROG Strix free
sync to HDR monitors at CES the smallest
of the bunch is the 32 inch XG 32 vqr
and that's a 1440p 144 Hertz VI panel
with the max
of 415 it's of brightness and 94% DCI p3
coverage this monitor qualifies for
display hgr 400 then we have the 49 inch
XG 49 VQ a 38 40 by 1080 monitor also at
144 Hertz also with the 415 it max
brightness and also with display HDR 400
and finally there's the XG 4/3 8q a 43
inch 4k monitor with a 600 nits maximum
brightness 120 Hertz refresh rate and
display h gr 600 the first 2 monitors
are coming in January while the 43 inch
4k display set for release in the spring
of 2019 presumably that means the u.s.
springtime so quarter 2 of 2019 all of
these panels sound pretty decent but I'd
be pretty wary of the HDR support
particularly for the 2 with display HDR
400 certification given there's no word
on local dimming RAZR are set to enter
the monitor market later this year with
the razer Raptor 27 a much more simple
name than most other OEMs choose to use
this display is a 27-inch 1440p IPS
panel at 144 Hertz with 95% DCI p3
coverage and free sync support it has
that signature Razer designs
unlike other monitors on the market but
it's said to be quite expensive at $700
when it launches later this year
considering you can get 27-inch 1440p
144 hertz IPS monitors around the $400
mark
I think Razer will struggle to move a
lot of units among price conscious
shoppers oddly they're also marketing it
towards eSports even though most eSports
gamers prefer fast TN panels at 1080p
not necessarily 1440p IPS displays they
also talked about a prototype 15.6 inch
1080p display for laptops with a 240
Hertz refresh rate so that would be
interesting for future gaming laptops
there's also a 15.6 inch 4k OLED laptop
display that they are experimenting with
perhaps for a future version of the
blade 15 all right so two more quick
announcements we have the asus rog
matrix geforce artex 2080 TI which is a
new card that includes what a soos is
calling an infinity loop cooler
basically this is an entire all-in-one
liquid cooler built into the shroud of
the GPU delivering performance
equivalent to a 240 millimeter a IO
if you look at this particular shot of
the card you can see the radiator
peeking out above the dual eight pm our
connectors presumably there is a pump
block beneath the radiator and then you
get the triple fan setup on the top all
up the card is a triple slot design and
it's set to cost a whopping $1600 it
will be interesting to see what its
cooling performance is like with the
radiator design as opposed to the usual
sort of heatsink you get with these
cards final topic for the week Corsair
has announced a new LED technology that
they've been developing in partnership
with Primax the new LEDs are called cap
Alex LEDs and they're set to provide a
number of benefits over traditional SMD
LEDs the volume is much smaller at 0.2
cubic millimeters rather than 2.8 cubic
millimeters so you can fit more in a
certain area and that will increase the
LED resolution behind a diffuser these
new cap Alex LEDs also up to 60 percent
brighter up to 60% more efficient and
have up to a 40% lower power draw with
longer lifespans than SMD LEDs so it'd
be cool to see these being used across
courses new LED illuminated products and
that's it for this first CES news Korn
episode we'll have more news coming
throughout the week as it trickles in
