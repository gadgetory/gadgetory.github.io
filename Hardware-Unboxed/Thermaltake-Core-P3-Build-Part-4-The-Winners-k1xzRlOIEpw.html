completed my new gaming rig using the
thermaltake Corp III chassis and all
that awesome custom liquid cooling gear
I've had a bit of time to sit back enjoy
a few games with it and so far
absolutely loving it for those of you
wondering at idle the 59 60 X CPU sits
at just 32 degrees and the GT x 1080 GPU
just 27 degrees these temperature
results a recorder with a room
temperature of 21 degrees when playing
the CPU has never crept about 57 degrees
and the GPU stays a shockingly cool 44
degrees so far just haven't had time to
play around with your overclocking on
this system so the benchmark results are
gonna be very similar to what you've
already seen for the core i7 / GT X 1080
combo so rather than make you guys wait
me longer I'm gonna announce the three
Thermaltake Corp III winners that said
you'll be seeing more of my Petri gaming
machine over the coming months as I've
got a few plans for it so make sure you
stay tuned for those anyway let's get to
the good stuff the winners
it was really hard to pick the winners
for this competition I was trying to
narrow it down but ended up with a list
of twenty so then I picked randomly from
that list I was blown away by how many
of you joined the forum and entered
anyway enough talking let's get to it
the first winner of the Thermaltake Corp
III chassis is a user by the name of
faster 172 congratulations mate
no messing around today the second
winner of the third will take called p3
is viper in squiggly brackets
congratulations Viper you've got one of
these coming your way

final winner of the thermal takeoff
