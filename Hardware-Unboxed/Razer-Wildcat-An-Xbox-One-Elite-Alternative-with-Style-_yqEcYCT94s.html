obvious go-to for PC gamers wanting to
do away with the mask partly due to the
fact that Sony continues to bewildering
ly render their popular DualShock
controllers incompatible with Windows 10
in their current generation Xbox one
console in mind
Microsoft produced something called the
Xbox elite wireless controller coming in
at a whopping $150 and offering an
unprecedented level of customization and
control over the inputs not one to shy
away from a challenge
razor of sense manufactured their own
elite style PC or Xbox one controller
that's what I have on hand today the
Wildcat and has some very important
differences one thing is the same though
the $150 price tag so as an elite or
want to be elite gamer which one should
you pick up let's take a look
design-wise the Wildcat is very similar
to the standard Xbox one controller and
that's a good thing when you pull it out
of the box it bears a simple all-black
design with Razer's logo on the right
hand side package with the wildcatter -
Razer green optional add-ons these
definitely make the controller look more
distinctive and I think they make it
more comfortable to use - my only gripe
with the groups was the installation
process you have to stick them on
yourself and it's not exactly easy to
apply them without any unwanted bumps or
folds have you ever tried to apply your
own window tint neither and that's for a
reason
hopefully the adhesive use last test of
time as would be a real shame they
started peeling off I certainly can't
imagine that you can peel them off and
reapply them and expect the same quality
adhesion either the face-up buttons on
the wild card are the same as those
found on the Xbox one controller and
it's actually started to venture around
the back that you discover its main
points of difference at the top just
behind the microUSB port later two
additional and programmable bumper style
buttons which are reached by extending
your index fingers a little further than
normal
these give a satisfying little click
when pressed and I found them easy to
reach I'm not sure how useful I'd find
them no as your index finger is then
divided between two sets of bumpers and
of course the standard triggers to
continuing to the underside of the
Wildcat we find two additional triggers
the rest right underneath the otherwise
unutilized middle thing is these
triggers are a welcome to a glossy
plastic and if you don't want them there
you even remove them with a small
supplied screwdriver and small flaps
flip down to cover the holes
lastly up front there's a built-in wired
headset adapter that protrudes from the
bottom of the controller I've never
really understood why this isn't
included standard on all Xbox
controllers even Microsoft's elite
controller doesn't have this fitted by
default the Wildcats overall build
quality is really good and the way to
the controller feels good in your hand
it's slightly heavier than the standard
Xbox one controller but quite a bit
lighter than Microsoft's elite
controller once I'm in gaming in the
zone I personally forget pretty quickly
which type of controller I'm using and
it's only really the extra buttons that
make a tangible difference in terms of
gameplay interestingly the wildcatters
are wired
only controller despite the fact that
the USB cable is completely removable
this does of course mean that response
times will shave some portion of
milliseconds away from its wireless
counterpart but I think a lot of game is
investing in a premium controller but at
least like the option to go wireless
programming the extra buttons on the
Wildcat is very quick and easy to do to
assign one of the N button to function
you simply hold down the remap button
and the M button you wish to program and
then press the regular button that you
want it to act as the control then
rumbles to let you know the mapping was
successful and you're good to go
additionally you can create two button
mapping profiles that you can then
switch between on the flyer to gaming
with the Wildcat was different in a good
way the color buttons have a very short
travel and very satisfying click when
press making them extremely responsive
the thumbsticks feel great too
especially with the optional green
rubber pads applied
I think the additional underside
triggers are just genius it allows you
to access to more buttons without moving
your thumbs off the sticks and this is
obviously a great advantage in line with
the very short travel of the face up
buttons the trigger locks in conjunction
with the Wildcats hair trigger mode
allow you to customize and shorten the
travel distance of each trigger in
shooting games for instance this allows
you to fire off individual rounds in
much quicker succession lastly the
directional pad on the Wildcat forgoes
the adjoin four-way design to instead
utilize four individual buttons which I
like cause I think it leaves less room
for miss presses overall the Wildcat is
a certain step up from the standard Xbox
one controller in terms of customization
and functionality I really like the
additional buttons
- underside triggers and how quickly and
easily you can assign them their
functions
compared with Microsoft's elite
controller the lighter weight is
certainly an advantage on account of the
fact that there's no battery inside this
also means that it is of course of wired
controller picking between the two will
probably come down to personal
preference in that department especially
considering they're at the same price
thanks for tuning in for another
Hardware unbox product review I'd love
to hear what you guys think of the Razer
Wildcat in the comments
I'm your host Matt as always and I'll
see you guys next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
