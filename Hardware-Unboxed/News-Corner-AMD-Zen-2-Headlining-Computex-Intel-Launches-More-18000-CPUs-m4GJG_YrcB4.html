corn another fairly typical week of news
has just passed we've got some CPU
related stuffs and GPU related stuff a
few game related stories I'm sure will
annoy some of the gamers watching this
video and the usual odds and ends it's
Friday
weather is nice here for those that love
getting our Aussie weather reports and
yeah let's get into some news first
topic from this week concerns Intel's
latest Enterprise announcements now we
don't usually cover enterprise and
server grade hardware all that much
because we're more of a consumer focus
Channel but there are a few interesting
things to point out among the
announcements if you want a full
breakdown of everything that was
announced I'd recommend checking out an
ant X comprehensive coverage what I want
to look at are the service cpus
specifically because these usually give
an indication of where high end desktop
chips are headed but with intel being
unable to transition past 4 10
nanometers at least for now they're
stuck doing some pretty crazy things to
improve performance with their server
platforms as expected intel have
announced and detailed cascade Lake ap
which officially becomes the xeon
Platinum 9200 family the top end chip
gives buyers the full 56 cores with 112
threads and 77 megabytes of level 3
cache when running at a base frequency
of 2.6 gigahertz along with their
presumably 3.6 gigahertz single core
turbo the xeon Platinum 9282 comes with
a massive 400 watt TDP this then filters
down through a 48 core option at 300
watts and to 32 core options at 250
watts each CPU has 40 lanes of PCI 3.0
and 12 channel ddr4 29:33 support
however these are not socketed chips
Intel is producing them as BGA only and
will be solved through OMS as a full
server design Intel aren't talking about
pricing but you can bet the CPU alone
will be ridiculously expensive then we
have the rest of the cascade Lake family
comprising of Xeon platinum gold silver
and bronze CPUs there are a ton of
options here but there hasn't been much
of an upgrade
when it comes to specifications for
example the New Zealand platinum 80 to
80 replacing 80 180 is only clocked 200
megahertz higher for both the base and
Bruce clocks across 28 cores within the
same 205 watt TDP considering the
pricing fit entails 28 core CPUs still
sits between 10 and $18,000
yeah we can expect that 56 core CPU to
be significantly higher than that
you'd think more than double which would
make it a mid 5 figure price CPU there
are a few other features here for
enterprises to use but again if you're
interested I suggest reading the anon
tech article given it's not really our
area of expertise from looking at these
releases it does seem like Intel doesn't
have anywhere to go with high-end
desktop processors until 10 nanometers
arrives I certainly don't expect them to
push out fifty six cores two desktops
anytime soon meanwhile we're very
interesting to see how AMD goes with
second generation epoch and how that
translates to thread Ripper CPUs later
in the year with Intel stagnating
there's a big opportunity here I think
speaking of AMD in what shouldn't be a
surprise to anyone the company is
hosting a keynote at Computex on the day
before the show officially kicks off
there are basically no details on what
will be shown up events and vague
descriptions AMD's event invite says AMD
CEO dr. Lisa suit will be delivering a
first-of-its-kind CEO keynote on
high-performance computing technologies
at Computex 2019 during the keynote dr.
Lisa sue and other high-profile guests
will highlight new details of upcoming
products and showcase how leading-edge
technologies and an open ecosystem are
driving an inflection point in computing
in 2019 a milestone year marking the
50th anniversary of AMD so there will be
all the usual stuff more information
about third-generation Rison processors
would make sense probably some stuff on
a embiez GPU roadmap you know the drill
and all the stuff to expect we don't
have any additional insights to share
with you on what AMD will be showing at
this stage although it does sound like
the keynote will be more on the teaser
slash announcement side of the scale
rather than a full product launch at
least going on ambe's activities at
Computex at least those that we know of
so far Intel are continuing to suck up
talent from everywhere in the industry
for their GPU division this
time hiring Tom Peterson from Nvidia as
originally broken I think by hot
hardware and gamers Nexus Peterson moved
from Nvidia to Intel at the start of
April which is a pretty big coup for the
blue team Peterson was involved heavily
with invidious technical marketing team
but also worked as an engineer on
various projects so he's the sort of
person that would be highly sought after
by a team entering the GPU market
Peterson adds to a collection of talent
hired by Nvidia in recent years
including Roger Cordrey and Chris hook
from AMD as well as Jim Keller formerly
from AMD and also Tesla get ready to
rage gamers because Borderlands 3 has
been announced as another timed
exclusive for the epic game store the
game is launching on September 13 but
will only be available through epics
platform with other digital store fronts
getting access in April 2020 I guess
only having six months of exclusivity is
a bit of an improvement of this
situation with other titles but it will
still disappoint those that feel like
epics store is lacking in features
compared to the vastly more populous
state Epic Games also recently
backtracked on this statement about how
they will eventually stop poaching games
from steam CEO Tim Sweeney said that
epic is open to continuing to sign
funding slash exclusivity deals with
willing developers and publishers
regardless of their previous plans or
announcements around Steam although
these calls must be up to the developers
and publishers from the developer and
publisher side of things it certainly
seems like epic is doing something right
as Borderlands 3 is one of many
exclusive games on the platform even
publishers with their own storefront
like Ubisoft are jumping ship from steam
to the epic store however the lack of
fundamental launcher and store features
compared to steam will continue to
frustrate gamers many of which think
these deals anti-consumer in more
annoying news for gamers EA is adding
microtransactions into battlefield 5 in
what is a move that shouldn't surprise
anyone who knows EA the in-game currency
directly tied to real-world dollars is
called battlefield currency or BC a name
that the development team I'm sure spent
hours debating you'll be able to use BC
to purchase cosmetics as well as unique
elite characters and timer saver XP
boosts the latter two will be introduced
in future updates ea says the elite
character does not grant any
type of gameplay advantage so it doesn't
come with any special weapons outside of
a signature melee weapon meanwhile the
time saver option isn't quite a pay to
win scheme but something about it
doesn't seem right to me for a
multiplayer title I think everyone
should have equal access to XP games
with that pain the timing of this one
also surprises me a bit given
battlefield 5 is still struggling to
establish itself in the multiplayer
ranks sure it does have a new battle
royale mode but after a poor launch I
think it's still a bit too soon to be
chucking microtransactions into the game
interested to hear your thoughts on this
though in the comments - grigor stories
to round out this shorter episode of
news corner first up we have the new
intel Wi-Fi 6ax 200 adapter if you
recall the various Wi-Fi standards were
renamed a while back with Wi-Fi 6
referring to what used to be a doe 2.11
ax so this new adapter is built for the
latest Wi-Fi standards it comes in an
MDOT tube form factor and also has
bluetooth 5.0 so will be seen in plenty
of laptops plus it supports stuff like
2x2 mu-mimo
and 160 megahertz wide channels with an
OEM price between 10 and 17 dollars
it shouldn't be too expensive to include
in new laptops final topic for this week
relates to more Nvidia Deception
although this time it's about their
entry-level laptop discreet GPUs
notebook check discovered that there are
surprised surprised two variants of the
mx2 50 in videos new GPU that just
launched into the market one is a 10
watt variant with a 1d 52 ID while the
other is a 25 watt variant labeled one
day 13 clock rates differ quite a bit
between the models as does performance
with previous MX models the 10 watt
variant was about 30% slower than the 25
watt model the big issue here is that
once again it's impossible for buyers to
know which MX 250 they're receiving when
they purchase a laptop with a GPU inside
because both GPUs carry the same name
how is a buy supposed to know if they
will be stuck with the slow or fast
models unless the OEM goes into details
on GPU clock speeds which they rarely do
another situation that dust isn't good
enough it's time to lift your game on
this one Nvidia and that's it for this
