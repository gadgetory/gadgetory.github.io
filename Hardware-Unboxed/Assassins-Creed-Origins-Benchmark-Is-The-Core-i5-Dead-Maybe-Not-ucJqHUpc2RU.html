we're doing a little benchmarking we're
gonna play around a little bit with
Assassin's Creed origins to see how it
behaves with different CPUs for those of
you unaware Assassin's Creed origins was
recently released and it has been
creating a bit of a stir in the PC tech
community due to how aggressively it
utilizes the CPU upon release a few
media outlets scramble to the benchmarks
and it quickly became apparent that the
game is extremely CPU intensive and not
in the way that ARMA 3 or Planet co-star
for example rather than just taxing a
few cause very heavily the game eats up
cause lots of cause pretty much all the
calls you got there are reports of it
eating up a thread rippin 1920 X for
example as a result modern quad cores
were getting slayed and there were
reports that the game was simply
unplayable on the core i5 7600 K and
while that certainly piqued my interest
we've already seen the 7600 Kane other
quad core CPU struggling in big 64
player battlefield 1 matches and while
the performance isn't always ideal it
certainly playable in my opinion anyway
I believe it was the computer based
results that have caused most of the
excitement as they showed the core i5 76
Henry K getting trampled by the rise and
5 1500 X as it only managed to match the
horizon 3 1300 X however it was the 1%
low results that were the most shocking
as the 7600 K dipped down to just 41 fps
making it slightly slower than a 1300 X
but I'm honestly not even sure how
that's possible but let's just ignore
that fact for a moment essentially the
7600 K was 30% slower than the Rison 5
1600 X and almost 40% slower than the
7700 K contradicting this information
there were some results published by
game GPU around three days earlier
showing the 7600 K never dropping below
60 FPS and consequently beating the rise
in v 1400 while easily beating the risin
three CPUs the higher core count rise in
part still did very well on their tests
that the 7600 K hardly looked pathetic
in comparison looking at where each
media outlet tested as best as I can
tell game GPU actually tested a more
demanding sex
game so that's a bit confusing therefore
I decided to have a look and see if I
could work out what was going on for
measuring CPU performance I found that
getting on your steed in this case a
camel and having a drop through the open
world city of Syrah is the way to go
there's generally loads of non player
characters here that give the CPU a
pretty hard time so using a GeForce GTX
1080 Ti and three quality presets let's
have a look at some results in graph
form before checking out some actual
gameplay right so let's start with the
ultra high quality preset we are using a
gtx 980ti after all here the 8th gen
core series is limited to just over 90
FPS on average with a 1% low result of
71 FPS the 77 Rek roughly matched the
average result but was 7% slower for the
minimum as it was often close to being
maxed out then we see a pretty large
drop from the 7600 okay which bottomed
out at just 52 fps making at 21% slow in
the 77 ok and 27% slower than the core
i5 8400 this also meant it was quite a
bit slower than Rison 7 1800 exum Rison
5 1600 X though it was shockingly quite
a bit faster than the horizon 5 1500 X I
would just like to point out that all
CPUs were tested using the same ddr4
3200 CL 14 memory I'll touch on memory
scaling with the 7600 okay a little
later on in the video but for now the
7600 K as well as the 1500 expose
provided highly player performance in
busy sections of the game reducing the
quality preset to high provides a decent
performance uplift and the core i5 76
under K in particular does much better
here
whereas the minimum frame rate for the
1500 X was increased by 17% the 7600 K
saw a massive 27% increase to 66 fps and
was now able to deliver very smooth
performance
the 7700 K was also able to max out the
GTX 1080i alongside the 8th gen core
processors dropping down to the medium
quality preset only boost the minimum
frame rates of the core i5 7600 okay and
rise and CPUs by a very small margin
interestingly though it did boost the
minimum and average frame rates of the
core i7 7700 K as well as the 8th gen
CPU is quite a bit so this does of
course point to a CPU bottleneck for the
7600 and
Rison CPUs here's a quick look at how
the 77 okay 7600 K an r5 1,500 X scale
when using various quality presets we
see strong and consistent gains as the
gtx 1080i is offered more breathing room
with the 77 oh okay on the other hand we
say that the 7600 K is pretty much maxed
out when using the higher quality preset
while the r5 1500 XC is virtually no
improvement from high to medium okay so
we've seen the graphs but I know they'll
be those screaming that bar graphs don't
tell the full story the 7600 K would
have been a stuttering mess well in an
effort to head off that noise here's a
look at some gameplay footage recorded
with an external capture device all
footage was recorded at 1080p using the
ultra high quality preset so worst case
scenario then first up let's compare the
six core six thread a core i5 8600 cage
of the six core 12 thread rosen 5 1600 X
here you can see that all six threads of
the 8600 K are heavily utilized and at
times the processor is in fact
completely maxed out yet despite this
frame rates remain high and more
importantly consistent the game was
certainly jitter free in my testing for
those wondering the CPU isn't
overclocked and multi-core enhancement
isn't enabled and we also have 16
gigabytes of ddr4 3200 memory installed
again this is the same memory that was
used on the rise and systems something
key to note here is the GPU utilization
which has locked pretty much at 97% on
the 8600 K system but if we look at the
r5 1600 and please note the GPU
utilization figure is mixed in with the
CPU thread so I am sorry about that we
can see the GP utilization is usually
around 80% but does fluctuate quite a
bit at times drops as low as 50% and
this does suggest a CPU bottleneck okay
so time for the quad cores the four
threaded 7600 K versus the eight thread
1500 X both CPUs were heavily utilized
the 7600 K was just about consistently
maxed out while the 1500 X saturd around
95% for the most part cheaper
utilization was similar around 70 to 80%
but at times did jump up much
on the core i5 processors which is
ultimately what gave at the edge under
heavy load I'd say they were in much the
same when the CPU was a Ford in a little
breathing room
the 7600 K ran away a little the key
thing to note here though is that even
with a heap of NPCs on screen both CPUs
provided a very smooth and playable
experience I think that covers pretty
much everything I want to discuss here
let's just let the gameplay footage
complete before moving on
the villages are drained of life no one
in no one could make a move without
being questioned threaten taxed or
beaten we all have learned to obey and
keep our heads down just quickly for
those wondering dropping the memory
speed on the 7600 K configuration a ddr4
2400 from 3200 reduce the frame rate by
about 5 to 10 FPS so a decent reduction
there but not that massive and the game
was still very playable this wasn't a
test I planned on doing this week I do
have something much bigger in the works
and you'll see that in the channel the
next day or two so I suppose you can
consider this more of a filler the main
goal here was to really see how Lauren's
CPUs and I don't mean low-end CPUs
Laurens CPUs handle themselves
Assassin's Creed origins in particular I
was really Cana see the core i5 7600
cave that would get crushed in a game
that we can now accurately benchmark but
that wasn't to be I know the 7600 case
struggles in 64 player battlefield 1
matches but despite the beliefs of many
viewers it's absolutely impossible to
accurately benchmark a multiplayer title
there's no point walking around in an
empty map or avoiding the action as that
defeats the purpose entirely anyway
getting back on track the 7600 kb played
Assassin's Creed origins just fine and a
section a game that I tested saw 0 frame
hitches I'm keen to explore the game
more but for now I'm satisfied that I've
tested a demanding section of the game
that's been tested by others with mixed
results that so I'm extremely confident
in my numbers and the performance shown
here it was disappointing to fight the
rise in 7 1800 X and R 5 16 hundreds
couldn't hold a candle to the core i5
8400 despite a number of things
I'd heard and seen prior to my own
testing as many of you know I really
liked the rise in five 1600 series and
while it did lay waste to the 7600 K
Intel's a rapidly aging quad core still
provided playable performance and the HT
naval core i7 77 RK was able to keep the
1600 X and its rear view mirrors there's
certainly more testing to be done but
for now I think we can all agree that
Assassin's Creed hydrogen's looks to be
very demanding on the CP o we'll utilize
many three
that said though it will also play
perfectly fine on the core i5 7600 K at
least for the section of the game that
I've played I'm not sure if there's a
more demanding section if there is I
will be very happy to explore it in a
future video anyway that's gonna do it
for this one I'm your host Steve see you
again soon guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
