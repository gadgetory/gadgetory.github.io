been asking for this one we're back
today to talk about ray tracing
once again this is of course because a
new update for Battlefield 5 was made
available yesterday along with the new
GPU driver from Nvidia they claimed to
improve DirectX ray tracing or DXR
performance by up to 50% in some
situations as you all know by now ray
tracing in battlefield 5 was a bit of a
disaster launched the implementation was
plagued by technical issues including
poor reflection resolution things being
incorrectly reflected and loads of noise
on top of this enabling ray tracing on
even the lowest settings cut the frame
rate in half or even into a third
depending on the GPU and resolution at
hand
this made the ITX 20 atti the only card
suitable for ray tracing and that was
using the low setting at 1080p the artex
2080 was barely able to deliver 60 FPS
and the r-tx 20 70 was seriously not
impressive in the performance it
delivered however with this new
combination of a game update and Driver
update Nvidia is claiming that our TX 20
attr owners will be able to enjoy ray
tracing at 1440p 60 FPS on ultra our TX
2080 owners should be able to do 1440p
60 FPS on medium and our TX 2070 owners
a set for 1080p 60 FPS using medium as
well going on our past results that
would mean around the 50% improvement
they're claiming and of course work
performance numbers for you a little
later the big question is how did EA
dice and Nvidia improve ray tracing
performance and specifically did they
downgrade visual quality to achieve this
well Invidia has a video up on their
YouTube channel that explains some of
the changes they've made not gonna list
all of them here but some of the biggest
ones include optimizing variable rate
ray tracing adjusting the diene noiser
and fixing ray traced foliage variable
rate ray tracing is the major change
this allows dice to prioritize ray
tracing on areas of the game world that
will benefit the most from the effects
such as reflective or shiny surfaces
essentially the game increases the
quality of ray tracing on these surfaces
at the expense of low-quality effects in
other areas considering many surfaces
really don't need ray tracing at all
this has the potential to speed
everything up the follow Chester was
also a big performance hog with dice
saying a bug caused too many rays to be
cast from foliage elements and that's
now been fixed as well so let's get into
some quality comparisons to see if
anything has changed starting with some
of the area's we tested in the last
video we're looking at the ultra DXi
setting in the previous version compared
to the latest patch really there's no
visual difference at all it seems when
the area's diced hasn't been able to
improve this the quality of reflections
on more matte surfaces like the gun
let's do a bit of pixelation to the
effect there the same could be said for
comparing low in the latest patch to low
when d XR was first released there's no
real difference in this scene there's
also no significant difference in visual
quality between low and medium or
between high and ultra though you can
spot that the higher to settings produce
raytrace reflections on more surfaces
just like last time in this scene that
features a large water puddle again
there's not a large difference between
all four decks our modes and some of the
issues with God Ray's being incorrectly
reflected appears to still be present in
this latest patch however there is a
visual quality downgrade that I spotted
in this area this new patch has
introduced some artifacting to the wave
ray tracing reflections are handled
previously everything that was supposed
to be reflected was reflected so you've
got these nice clean for the most part
supremely accurate reflections that blew
away screen space reflections for visual
quality however with the latest patch
some screen space reflection like
artifacts have crept back into ray
traced surfaces if you look closely at
the water surface at times an object
will move across the reflected area like
an AI character or a falling leaf and
for a brief moment you'll spot the
classic screen space reflection like
streak caused by that object obstructing
the reflections path my guess here is
that dice have chosen to more
aggressively curl rays from objects not
in view which has improved performance
significantly but it's at the cost of
occasional artifacts where something
that should still be in view is getting
cold erroneously it makes the
reflections slightly more ugly but it's
still significant upgrade on basic
screen space reflections where this
issue is much more widespread
yet the change seems to be a widespread
modification to the particle system
which makes leaves much less likely to
float over or land on reflected surfaces
I wasn't a hundred percent sure whether
this has happened but I've looked in a
variety of scenes and noticed that while
the same number of particles are visible
in the air and on mat surfaces in
general leaves just don't obscure
puddles of water as often as they used
to and this is the case where the DXi is
on or off
I even spotted some leaves landing on
puddles randomly but then quickly
disappearing this change does affect how
the game looks with that ray tracing
enabled but I actually think it's a
positive overall because particles
caused lots of artifacts in screen space
reflections as well so turning down one
area of that effect is good and I'm not
sure he would have noticed this if I
didn't point it out anyway as for noise
there is still a fair bit of noise to
dxi reflections depending on the surface
in particular it seems the dice haven't
been able to solve the extreme noise
present on larger water surfaces the
rippling waves are just too much for the
D noise at handling what you're left
with is a ton of ugly noise however
noise has been improved for clearer
surfaces like Windows gamers Nexus
showed in their video this tramcar
window that had a ton of noise in its
reflection when you move around with the
latest patch you can still spot noise
when moving about but the denoiser is
much faster to respond so there's less
noise ghosting in this image in other
areas you might spot noise only for
reflected trees while static objects
remain nice and sharp again I suspect
the issue with foliage noise is down to
some of the changes they've made to
improve performance with ray tracing
foliage in my previous video I also
found it hard to spot the difference
between the four different DXi modes and
came to the conclusion that there are
really only two modes but looking more
closely that does appear to be subtle
differences between the four modes in
terms of reflection resolution and draw
distance the higher the setting the
cleaner the reflections will look and
the more draw distance you'll get very
subtle changes though which leaves
medium looking almost identical to low
for the most part and similarly high
looks very close to Ultra overall I'd
say the patch has for the most part
resulted in no change in the XR quality
though some aspects are improved and
some aspects are degraded depending on
the area most of the work seems to have
just been focused on
making sure ray-tracing isn't
unnecessarily applied and that's where
the performance improvements have come
from though there are still some notable
issues that need work like reflection
noise so let's talk performance the
first thing to note is that to get
improved DXR performance you need both
the latest battlefield 5 game patch and
in videos new for 1722 driver the driver
alone seems to provide a 6 to 8 percent
performance improvement to rate racing
with the pre patched version of the game
so Nvidia definitely has done some
driver side work to improve our Tech's
performance for this video Steve has
tested battlefield 5 with driver for
1722 before and after the game patch so
we're only measuring the performance
impact of the patch itself but do note
hour before numbers for RTX on are about
6 to 8 percent higher than what we
showed in that initial r-tx video due to
the new driver the driver did not impact
our TX off performance which is
identical or there abouts to our first
DX our video our testing this time
around is much more comprehensive we've
tested the RT X 20 atti the RT x 2080
and our TX 2070 at 1080p and 1440p on
our core i7 8700 k test rig overclocked
to 5 gigahertz post patch we've tested
all four DXi presets so you can see how
the performance differences stack up
there we'll be mostly focused on ultra
and low we've also tested two areas
instead of just one the first is the
taro your area which we used in our
initial video which is a bit of a rate
racing stress test and showed the worst
performance in the game but we've also
included performance in the Nord --less
area which is a snowy map that has
virtually no ray-tracing and honestly
looks very similar whether you have DXR
on or off first up we're going to look
at our TX 20 atti performance in the
intensive to your map at 1080p the good
news here first up is 1% low performance
is improved for the Ultra DX Isle mode
it's now consistently sitting above 60
FPS post patch were also looking at a
57% improvement to average frame rates
with the ultra d XR mode and a 21%
improvement for the low mode however
despite a small reduction to frame rate
for DX our off post patch the mode is
still 75 percent fast
of an ultra DXi and 53 percent faster
than load DXR previously this there was
more than a 2x difference but this
performance penalty is still pretty
brutal and 1440p it's a similar story a
51 percent improvement to ultra
performance and a 29 percent improvement
to low performance DXR off is more than
twice as fast as ultra while there's a
53% advantage over low unfortunately the
situation is worse in the Northland app
yes there is a performance improvement
at 1080p but Ultra is only 18% faster
and low is just 5% faster comparing the
pre and post patch performance on top of
this DX our off is still 56 percent
faster than DX our low and in our test
area there is essentially no visual
difference between these two modes due
to the general lack of DXR effects in
this area the game still needs to cast
rays though even if it has no effect on
the visuals which causes this massive
drop to performance and 1440p again
similar story the performance
improvement is slightly higher but DXi
off is still much faster I guess the
good news we're looking at these are TX
20 atti results is that invidious claims
about performance are generally correct
you can play using the ultra DXR mode at
1440p and expect 60fps you could also
get 90 FPS using DX I'll low at 1080p
but in both situations turning off DXi
delivers well over a hundred fps
especially at 1080p so ray tracing is
still a huge performance hog time to
look at the RT x 2080 interieur at 1080p
the improvements for ultra and low is
64% and 30% respectively when compared
to the pregame patch however the game is
still more than 50% faster with DX are
disabled
compared to DX are low and 1440p NVIDIA
is correct in saying the RT X 2080 can
deliver a 60 FPS experience using the
medium DX our mode performance
improvements are similar to what we've
already been discussing but again
performance is more than 50% faster with
DX are off in the less intensive
knotless at 1080p games are modest like
with the RT X 20 80 TI at below 20% for
both the ultra and lo modes and once
again in what's a repeating theme here
performance is improved by more than 50
percent with the effect disabled
compared to it enabled on the low mode
and it's a similar story at 1440p as
well in this map the ITX 2080 is a GPU
we basically called useless for ray
tracing last time because it couldn't
even achieve 60fps at 1080p with the low
DXR mode post patch in the terior area
we're looking games of 79% using the
ultra mode compared to the pre patch
version and 33% with a low mode this now
makes the low mode suitable for 1080p
60fps as invidious States however and
yes you guessed it performance is
roughly 50% higher with DX are disabled
compared to on the low mode it's
probably not worth talking about 1440p d
XR with the RT x 2070 too much because
the GPU struggles stretch 60fps with DX
r on low though this is a big
improvement over what we saw previously
performance here is around 42% higher
with DX i disabled and finally we have
the nord las' map at 1080p we're seeing
gains of 22% comparing the low mode
before and after the patch while ultra
gets a 25 percent boost again there's
essentially no visual difference between
DX are low and darks are off yet off
delivers 44% more performance then we
get to 1440p on the same map and against
all a very similar story so there's a
lot to break down here firstly nvidia is
i guess right on the money with their
performance claims a 50% uplifted
performance is fairly typical between
the pre and post patch versions of the
game and what they say is possible with
their various r-tx GPUs is indeed
possible and in the more intensive areas
of the game no less we're now in the
situation where the r-tx 20/80 TI can
use d XR ultra at 1440p the ITX 20/80 is
suitable for DX are low at 1440p or
ultra at 1080p and the RT x 2070 is now
able to handle 1080p with DX i'll low
that's significant especially for the RT
x 2070 which was previously a bit
hopeless but there's a lot of caveats to
those claims you'll only see 50%
performance games comparing the ultra
mode before and after the patch gains
are much lower
comparing the low mode it's more around
the 30% mark and these improvements are
only in areas where there are lots
of DX our reflection effects in areas
where there are no visible reflections
you only see modest performance gains of
25% or lower and this is kind of where
the problems continue to exist for ray
tracing and battlefield 5 in the North
listeria we tested and other areas with
few decks are effects the patch doesn't
improve performance all that much and
that's a big deal because we're still in
a position where turning decks are off
in these areas provides upwards of 50%
more performance for practically
identical visuals having this effect
enabled in these areas is just wasting
processing power reducing frame rates
from say 130 fps down to 80 FPS for no
quality improvement then in areas where
you can see a visual improvement the
performance difference between DX are on
and off is still enormous in an absolute
best case scenario you're looking at 50%
more performance from DX are off
compared to DX I'll low but if you want
to use the high or ultra modes that gap
grows to over a 2x performance
improvement depending on your GPU and
resolution sure we did see up to a 3x
difference before this latest patch but
getting half the framerate with DX are
on is still a massive penalty to pay for
what amounts to a small improvement of
visuals in general I still don't think
battlefield 5 is a suitable game for
ray-tracing
this is a fast-paced shooter that you
want to run at high frame rates
why would someone with say an RT X 2070
choose to play at 1080p 60fps with DX r
low compared to 1440p 80 FPS with DX r
off why would an RT x 28 ET Iona lock
themselves into 1440p 60 FPS when you
could run the game at 4k with higher
frame rates than that or at 120 + FPS at
1440p it's really not a sensible choice
for this sort of game and to make
matters worse it's almost impossible to
tell where the DXi is on or off when
you're actually playing a multiplayer
match we've shown a lot of static
comparisons in this video nice you know
slow close-ups and that sort of thing
but the reality is when playing the game
you're not looking at the nice
reflections you're focused on enemies
and objectives delivering 50% better DXi
performance with this patch doesn't
change the fact the effect only has a
mine
impact of visuals when you're playing
and by enabling the effect you're
missing out on plenty of performance
that can have a significant impact on
how the game is run in fact for the
multiplayer modes we not only recommend
disabling DXR but turning down a bunch
of other quality sayings as well for
maximum performance the question now
becomes whether ray-tracing will be
worth it in other games particularly
single-player tiles like shadow of the
Tomb Raider where you have more time to
appreciate the visuals while in video
and dice of Cree worked hard to improve
ray-tracing performance in battlefield 5
and we're no longer left with half to a
third of the performances of baseline
the performance it is still going to be
brutal in other games if in the very
best case scenarios you can increase
your frame rate by 50% when disabling
DXR reflections I really hate to think
what the performance it will be when
games integrate other DXR effects shadow
of the Tomb Raider for example was set
to use DXi lighting and shadows which is
only going to tank performance further
and what if a game doesn't use the
optimizations dices achieved in
battlefield 5 well we could see more
performance losses again and this is
without even considering the noise and
other issues with ray tracing at the
moment I do genuinely hope NVIDIA can
continue to work on an optimized ray
tracing to get more performance at no
cost of visuals because at the moment
the technology still isn't ready even
after this patch they've made
significant steps towards improving how
the intensive technology performs but
we're far from the point where we'd
recommend to play games with it enabled
especially battlefield 5 and really it
still can't be considered a key selling
point for invidious RT X cards a luxury
bonus sure but not something you should
base a purchasing decision on that's
basically it for this revisit of
battlefield 5s DXR implementation with
the latest patch again both Steve and I
spent a lot of time on this video
together out as soon as possible so we
hope you appreciate it
