today's monitor review comes courtesy of
you guys the commenters the patreon
members and just general viewers of the
channel you guys have been telling me to
review a Cogan monitor for ages and
thanks to Cogan I've been able to make
that happen
and yes before you ask I do have a bit
of a cold at the moment I've been sort
of working through that over the past
week that hasn't stopped me from testing
out more displays which is what I'm
still able to get this review out so the
model that in question is the Cogan Kamm
341 f qu LA which is sensibly advertises
just the Cogan 34 wqhd kerbs 21:9
ultra-wide 100 hertz precinct monitor 34
40 by 1440 on their website I'm probably
not going to say that absolute mouthful
of a product name in the future but from
the website name you've probably been
able to figure out all the key
specifications for our international
viewers you might be wondering what is
coconut never heard of this brand before
and well that's because it's an
Australian exclusive brand but before
you click away you might have spotted
something very familiar about this 34
inch monitor design it looks quite
similar to some of the vo-tech monitors
I've been testing out on the channel
over the past year in fact I suspect
both biotech and Kogan are using the
same odium for this product an OD M or
original design manufacturer is a
company that develops products it then
sells to other companies that put their
brand on it I'm not sure which OD m is
responsible for this monitor but the
Kogan 34 inch monitor I'm reviewing
today looks almost identical to the
vo-tech G and 34 see that North
Americans can buy off Amazon the stand
is slightly different but the rear
design is a dead giveaway and the on
screen display used with this kokomo
delay is identical to some of the
biotech monitors aren't tested the
specifications such as the 34 inch 1440p
ultra wide VA panel at 100 Hertz are
also identical so while this review will
be based on my experience with the Kogan
model I suspect most of what I will be
talking about he will also apply to the
vo-tech GM 34 C and that's great
use really because both options are very
affordable in their respective
territories the GN 34c is available for
just 450 US dollars which is an absolute
steal for these specifications in 2019
undercutting many competitors by several
hundred dollars
similarly the Kogan 30 forge ultra wide
is a steal for Australians costing just
five hundred and forty dollars which
again is several hundred dollars less
than the next cheapest equivalent option
so what does five hundred and forty
dollars get you well I've got to say I
wasn't super impressed with the build
quality of this monitor I've actually
quite liked the design of past biotech
displays but this one just feels a bit
cheaper and less well constructed on the
rear there are some quite obvious and
messy seams where plastic panels join
together and I'm not a fan of the glossy
plastic strip that runs around the edges
on top of this The Stand is not very
stable there's a lot of play in the
connection point which isn't great for
such a wide monitor there's also no
height adjustability which is an issue
when the monitor sits so low to your
desk I suspect many buyers were you're
looking to get a visa mount for this
monitor given that at least for me it
sits uncomfortably low at a desk and the
wide prongs stand is hard to raise using
simple cheats like stacking books for
example the problems with the design
don't end there while the rear panel is
nice clean and free of game elements the
ports are split into two separate areas
each with its own cover one is for the
power plug and the other is for the
display port HDMI and DVI connectors
this makes it hard to achieve neat cable
management because the cables are coming
from two separate areas each quite far
apart and with no obvious rounding point
through the stand this is probably
sounding like a bit of a nitpick but
it's just one of those things that most
other monitors seem to get right the on
screen menu is controlled through face
buttons rather than a directional toggle
so flicking through all the options is
difficult I wouldn't say there's a lot
of features in there but you do get
several modes multi window options check
crosshairs and color controls all of
these would be easier to navigate with
directional controls also worth
mentioning is that free sync is disabled
by default you want to turn that on to
get an adaptive sync with low framerate
compensation luckily as we move into the
performance section of this review there
are many more positive things to talk
about
response times are one the co
34 inch ultra wide uses a VA panel and
we know that VA is the slowest of the 3
main LCD technologies however this
particular panel set to its fastest
overdrive setting which does not
introduce noticeable overshoot Coxon
with a greater great average of just
five point eight eight milliseconds this
is several milliseconds faster than most
VA s that typically sit around eight
milliseconds and that helps reduce blur
smearing and ghosting this isn't the
fastest VA panel I've tested but it's
certainly one of the better ones sitting
in the response time zone that gaming
grade IPS panels tend to occupy while
the refresh rate of a hundred Hertz is
nothing special given we now have 120
and 144 Hertz monitors at this
resolution the fast response times mean
a hundred percent of transitions occur
within the Refresh window so the display
is never bottlenecked by response times
and this is comfortably a true 100 Hertz
panel input lag is also good not the
fastest I've seen for a gaming monitor
but at around 5 milliseconds it's
middle-of-the-pack and won't slow you
down significantly in your quest for
gaming greatness for NVIDIA GPU owners
you'll be happy to hear that adaptive
sync works without any issues provided
you enable the checkbox in the Nvidia
control panel brightness and contrast
ratio are both good at around 310 it
speak the Kogan 34 ultra wide should be
suitable for most users while the
contrast ratio of slightly over 3000 to
one is bang-on for a VA I've actually
seen some ultra wide vs and other
monitors using Samsung VI panels slip
down to around 2,000 to one but no such
problems with this display out of the
box car performance was better than
expected out of the box with game and
grade monitors I don't expect factory
calibration but I always like it when a
display put some respectable figures the
white point of 6700 K is closer than
many similar monitors get to the correct
value and the overall CCT curve while a
little wonky isn't too far off the mark
gamma is slightly too low but a Delta II
average of two point five eight is good
for a gaming monitor it's not under 2.0
so it's not at the threshold for proper
accuracy but it's pretty close and
that's a strong result this continues
with a look at saturation which again
you'll see here a Delta a average of two
point two for this is skewed somewhat by
much better yellow and cyan performance
than the other colors and you
but some slight under saturation for
reds and blues through the mid-tones but
the fact this display has been
configured with srgb in mind is
definitely welcome performance does fall
away in our more intensive color checker
test with a Delfy average of 3.26 and
some particularly loose values but
really this is a typical bordering on
good result for a gaming monitor in its
default configuration it's better than
several other via tech monitors I
reviewed getting respectable performance
out of the box is good because there's
not a lot you can do in the on screen
menu to adjust color performance there
are white balance and saturation
controls here but that weird CCT curve
you saw earlier is hard to correct with
just basic red green and blue sliders I
messed around here a bit but was only
able to get performance to be worse that
said you can always run a full
calibration and that's exactly what I
did using display Cal patreon members
can't download the software profile I
created although as always this profile
won't deliver true accuracy for other
monitors due to peril variants the
results from a full calibration are good
wouldn't say it's the best I've seen but
it definitely fixes a number of issues
the contrast ratio does drop down a bit
down to around twenty-nine hundred to
one button that's not a huge concern
panel uniformity is mediocre which tends
to be the case with ultra wide curved VA
displays the outer edges in particular
are problem areas with Delta ease of
above 3.0 relative to the center while
the bottom and top edges are also a bit
uneven the center area is decent but you
shouldn't expect great uniformity with
this sort of display at the end of the
day the positives outweigh the negatives
with the Kogan 34 inch ultra what most
of the performance metrics are decent
especially response times which are
better than usual for a VA panel we're
getting a 100 Hertz refresh rate which
isn't a super high refresh these days
but does give a smoother experience than
60 Hertz by a long way and adaptive sync
works perfectly with both AMD and NVIDIA
GPUs to enhance the gaming experience
further I really liked the combination
of a 21-9
aspect ratio 34 40 by 1440 resolution
and 100 Hertz refresh rate as well for
ultra wide I feel this is the sweet spot
in 2019 and current pricing reflects
that being able to get this monitor for
540 ozzie or an essentially identical
via tech display for 450 US dollars
it's an absolute steal when 120 or 144
Hertz monitors are often double the
price you can see why I'd recommend a
hundred Hertz monitors for shoppers
after the best bang for buck speaking of
the vo-tech GN 34 c while i haven't
specifically reviewed that monitor i
believe most of what i've tested and
found with this Kogan monitor review
will also apply to that model maybe put
an asterisk on that because i'm not a
hundred percent sure but i'd be pretty
confident in recommending the vo-tech
options as well based on what i've seen
here this monitor isn't perfect though
the build quality and design features
leave a lot to be desired and that's
clearly where costs have been cut but
given the panel delivers a great gaming
experience despite these problems and
it's a lot cheaper than other monitors
to me it's pretty easy to look past
these minor flaws in favor of the
screaming good value this display brings
that's it for this review if you're
interested in either the codeine or
vo-tech options you can find links to
those in the description below sorry to
our viewers in Europe and Asia because I
believe neither of these displays are
available there but they could be more
models from the same ODM out there so
definitely do some research there
