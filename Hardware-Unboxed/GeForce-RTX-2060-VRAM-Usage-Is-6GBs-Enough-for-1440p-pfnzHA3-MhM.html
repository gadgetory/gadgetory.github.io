are investigating claims that the RCX
2060 is a bad buy due to the fact that
it only has a six gigabyte VM capacity
the 2060 typically offers around gtx
1070 TI like performance but where is
the 1070 TI and even the non TI model
pack and a gigabyte memory buffer the
2060 gets just 6 e gigabytes so that
means this is the fastest graphics card
to ever come with just a 6 gigabyte
memory buffer the previous king of that
title would have been the geforce gtx
980ti and as far as I know the Maxwell
flagship part has aged very well so at
least up until this point the 6 gigabyte
capacity hasn't been an issue the 2060
is only around 15% faster on average
when compared to the gtx 980ti
so while a lot of people are freaking
out or at least a lot of people who
comment on our videos I don't believe
the six gigabyte vram buffer is really
going to be an issue at least in the
short term that said I did want to run a
few more tests so here we are the first
thing I wanted to do was report the peak
VM allocation at 1440p in all the games
we currently use to test GPU performance
there's 37 games in total so this
portion of the testing alone took more
than a day and I have to admit watching
vram allocation while playing around in
these games for up to 10 minutes at a
time that wasn't the most enjoyable
experience before we look at memory
usage it's important to note that we're
really looking at allocation and not
necessarily usage memory allocation sees
memory reserved for storing data
required by the GPU and some of that
data allows the GPU to perform various
calculations often games allocate more
vram than is required as having the
memory reserved ahead of time can
improve performance a recent example
this was seen when testing with Resident
Evil 2 we often saw a vm allocation go
as high as eight and a half gigabytes
when testing the RT x20 atti at 4k but
there was no performance penalty when
using a graphics car with only six
gigabytes of VRAM there was however a
big performance penalty for using
graphics cards with less than 6
gigabytes of vram so while the game
would allocate around a gigabytes
when available at the 4k resolution and
appears to be using somewhere between
four and six Q bytes and memory probably
much closer to six gigabytes anyway
here's a look at the 37 games we
currently test with and here you can see
how memory allocation differs between
the r-tx 2016 and 2017 the 2070 of
course having a larger 8 gigabyte memory
buffer will allow for a greater amount
of memory to be allocated if need be
starting from the top we find our most
memory intensive titles quake champions
is a surprisingly hungry title though
truth be told this game seemed to just
allocate all the available memory I
estimate usage is actually below 4
gigabytes purely based on what we've
seen when testing rise of the Tomb
Raider is another Hungary title but
usage for this one is probably closer to
the allocation figure and we've already
discussed Resident Evil 2 and I suspect
shut off the Tomb Raider is very similar
to rise of the Tomb Raider beyond that
though allocation does drop below 6
gigabytes we see 10 titles where
allocation is between 5 &amp;amp; 5 &amp;amp; a half
gigabytes with everything else
allocating 4 gigabytes or or less now
it's worth noting that almost all of
these titles were tested using the
maximum quality preset with some form of
anti-aliasing enabled that being the
case it's very easy to tweak the visual
settings in most of these games to
reduce memory usage without noticeably
impacting the visual quality and I'll
explore that a bit more in a moment
moving on I've seen quite a few people
now argue that cheering's improved
memory compression makes all the
difference when compared to Pascal so
they're saying the 6 gigabyte 2060s
memory buffer is technically larger than
that of the gtx 1060 s this really isn't
a valid argument for a few reasons one
being of 2060 is over 50% faster than
the 1060 and therefore will be expected
to handle drastically higher visual
quality settings and resolutions so I
doubt any compression improvements are
substantial enough to make up for that
that said I was interested to see how
this impacted memory allocation so once
again I loaded up all 37 games this time
using the gtx 1066 gigabyte to see what
we hit for the peak allocation typically
memory allocation was higher with the
gtx 1060 there were a few tiles where
half a gigabyte higher but for the most
part we were only looking at a hundred
to two hundred megabytes interestingly
in warframe allocation was lower with
the gtx 1060 I did reload the game a few
times but receiver the same results each
time so yes memory management for
churring GPUs is better it's just not
that much better okay so we've looked at
memory allocation in a huge amount of
games now I think it's about time we
check out some performance numbers for
this I will be comparing the RT x 2060
and 2070 and four of the more heavily
memory allocated titles I suppose so the
four most heavily memory allocated tiles
that we came across were quake champions
Resident Evil 2 and the tomb Raider's so
I want to see how they scale from 1440p
to 4k and then see if the 2060 is
suffering from a lack of VRAM if it is
the margin should obviously increase as
we increase the resolution and in
particular the frame time performance
that should really take a nosedive first
that we have quake champions are looking
at the 1440p results we see at the RT X
2060 is just 7% slower than the 2070
when comparing the average framerate and
just 5% slower for the point 1 percent
lower result increase in the resolution
we see that the 2060 is 9% slower for
the average framerate and 8 percent
slower for the 0.1% low frame time
result so yes the margins did grow at 4k
but nowhere near big enough to claim a
VRAM issue for the RT x 2060 it's far
more likely that this increases down to
the higher core count GPU just being
better utilized and less bottlenecked at
the higher resolution
moving on to rise of the Tomb Raider
here we see the 2060 trailing by just a
4% margin at 1440p for the average
framerate and 0.1% low result these
margins are increased to 13% and 11% at
4k
again you could quite easily just blame
this on the 2066 key bite memory buffer
but I would advise against that the 2060
packs 17 percent fewer cuda cores and
therefore should be anywhere from 10 to
17 percent slower than the 2070 this
means we're probably running into some
kind of system Bowl neck at 1440p that's
limiting performance of the 2070 in any
case the RTA
2060 was just as smooth as the 2070 at
both resolutions of course frame rates
weren't ideal for either GP at 4k but
they did offer a similar experience next
up we have the newer tomb raider game
shut all of the tomb raider and this is
a fantastic looking title at 1440p the
2060 was 11% slowed off the average
frame rate and 0.1% low moving to 4k we
set the average frame rate margin
increased to 16%
but the point one percent low reduced to
just 7% again no memory capacity issues
here frame time performance for the 2060
was excellent and again it has 17% fuel
recruiter cores so a 16 percent deficit
in a heavily GPU bound scenario makes
sense
if you saw my recent 57 GPU Resident
Evil 2 benchmark then you will have seen
these results but for those of you who
haven't let's quickly go over them
so at 1440p the 2060 was 11% slower for
the average framerate and 10% slower for
the point 1 percent low result those
margins change ever so slightly at 4k
the 2060 is now 13 percent slower for
the average frame rate but just 8
percent slower for the 0.1% low result
again no evidence of running out of VRAM
here for the RT X 2060 ok so it seems
pretty clear that right now even for 4k
gaming 60 gigabytes of vram really is
enough
of course the RT X 2060 isn't really
powerful enough to game at 4k at least
using maximum quality settings but
that's not really the point of this
video now I can already hear guys
screaming at me that the issue isn't
about gaming today it's about gaming
tomorrow like much later tomorrow I
believe the argument is something like
yeah the 2060 is ok now but for future
games it just won't have enough vram and
while I don't have a functioning crystal
ball I know this is going to be both
true and not so true at some point games
are absolutely going to require more
than 6 gigabytes of vram for maximum
quality settings the question is by the
time that happens will the RT X 2060 be
powerful enough to provide playable
performance using those quality settings
it's almost certainly not going to be an
issue this year I doubt it'll be a real
problem neck
yeah in three years time maybe you might
have to start managing some quality
settings then four years probably
probably start to become a problem and
I'd say in five years time it will
almost certainly be a problem we can
look at AMD's fiji gps as an example of
aging poorly juda limited vram The Fury
series was released back in mid 2015
with just four gigabytes of HBM memory
the fury acts was to compete with the
gtx 980ti
and the GeForce GPU packed a slower but
larger six gigabyte buffer just three
years later the fury axe was struggling
to keep up with the 980ti and modern
tiles of 1440p using high quality
textures we recently saw the fury ax
struggling in resident evil 2 so much so
that it was slower than even the rx 580
and the experience wasn't even
comparable whereas the rx 580 with it a
gigabyte vram buffer offered silky
smooth gameplay the fury ax was a
stuttering mess that said while the fury
X can't handle Resident Evil 2 with the
max preset enabled you can manage the
quality settings for smooth performance
dropping the quality preset from max to
graphics priority reduce the memory
allocation from 7 gigabytes at 1440p and
this was enough to revive the fury X
honestly image quality really wasn't
that different certainly wasn't
noticeable but what was was the gaming
experience used in the fury X whereas
the RT X 2060 only sees a 17% boost to
the average frame rate the fury X is a
massive 40 percent performance increase
however it's the frame time performance
that's massively improved here we see a
97 percent increase for the 1% low and
61% for the point 1 percent low and most
crucially the frequent stuttering is now
gone in fact I didn't notice any
stuttering at all so whereas the fury X
was 27% slower than the RT X 26 to use
in the max preset and basically
unplayable due to stuttering with the
slightly lower graphics priority preset
enabled the fury X was just 14 percent
slower and offers a similar experience
in terms of smoothness anyway as it
stands right now the GeForce r-tx 2060
has enough vram to power through today's
games using the maximum quality settings
and as a GPU targeting 14
40p gaming or maybe extreme high refresh
rate gaming at 1080p and just fit the
bill nicely at least in terms of
performance I think we can all agree
that eight gigabytes of gddr5 an RT X 20
60 second hand in two or three years
time I would certainly benefit from
having that extra vram but for those
buying one of these right now I don't
think it really makes much difference
doesn't seem to be an issue right now as
we just saw from all the testing and I
think people are sort of beating this up
to be a much bigger issue than it is for
the RT X 2060 I also doubt you'll run
into much trouble over the next few
years and of course if you do it is very
easy to solve it's not like having not
enough cores on a CPU you can't really
do much about that in games like
Battlefield 5 it's going to stutter and
you're gonna have issues if you don't
have enough cause there isn't a setting
you can reduce that takes the load of
having not enough cause at least not
enough anyway getting sidetracked still
I will be keen to see how the RT X 2060
travels over the next few years I'll
certainly be closely monitoring its
performance against the RT X 2070 and
Vega 56 for now though that is going to
