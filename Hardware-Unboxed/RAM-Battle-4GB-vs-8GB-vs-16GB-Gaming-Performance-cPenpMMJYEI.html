I'm your host Matt and today we're going
to be taking a look at how much memory
or RAM your gaming rig needs to deliver
optimal performance and all of the
latest titles recently I've noticed a
lot of discussion regarding system
memory and many gamers are now
suggesting that 16 gigabytes is the new
minimum or standard configuration for
the most part I recommend friends go
with 8 gigabytes of memory and only go
up to 16 gigabytes if they have the
money to spare as after all it's not a
huge investment these days even when
talking about ddr4 still I was
interested to see what kind of impact
the memory capacities had on typical
modern high-end gaming systems the
platform of choice today was the Intel
LGA 1150 using a core i5 4690k processor
to help keep the results consistent and
remove any system bottlenecks at the
same time the 4690k was overclocked and
locked at 4 gigahertz with features such
as turbo boost and speed steps disabled
for the GPU we went with the mighty
geforce gtx 980ti and testing was
conducted at 4k the same DVI through
2400 memory was used in each test and
the exact same memory timings are also
used I'm most interested to see if
there's any difference between using a
gigabytes and 16 gigabytes of memory but
just for the hell of it I went with a 4
gigabyte single channel configuration as
well rather than go with a completely
fresh installation of Windows we decided
it was better to use an operating system
that has been pre lived in granted
Windows 10 hasn't been out for very long
but my personal gaming system has a heap
of applications and of course games
already installed when testing I had
Firefox and Chrome open in the
background each with half a dozen tabs
open my email client thunderbird was
also open along with a few Excel and
Word documents all told with 16
gigabytes of memory installed the system
is consuming 4.8 eager bytes of memory
before any gaming it even started it's
also worth mentioning that the page file
was enabled while testing and Samsung
SSD 850 pro 2 terabytes is a storage
device of choice
first up we have Grand Theft Auto 5 and
the results are very surprising all
three memory configurations are an
average of 41 frames per second at 4k
the minimum frame rates are also much
the same the 4 gigabyte configuration
drops just a single frame when compared
to the 8 gigabyte and 16 gigabyte
configurations the frame time data
doesn't reveal anything new either
all three memory configurations allow
for roughly the same frame time
performance so now for the really boring
part the next 21 games all show very
much the same performance Transit's
grand theft auto 5 rather than make you
sit through another 21 slides where I
say the same things over and over again
I'll quickly skip through them if you
want to study any of the results in
detail just hit pause and please note
that I'll include a timestamp index in
the video description below
you
well those results are very boring and
quite surprising if I'm honest well I
didn't expect to see any difference
between using 8 gigabytes and 16
gigabytes of memory for gaming I was
very surprised to see that running just
4 gigabytes of memory made little to no
difference in fact when gaming I
honestly couldn't tell the difference
between using an individual 4 gigabyte
stick in single channel opposed to two 4
gigabyte modules running in dual channel
for an 8 gigabyte capacity as far as I
could tell level load times are also
very much the same though they could be
in part due to the Samsung SSD it would
be interesting to run these tests again
using a mechanical hard drive but how
many gamers worried about getting the
most out of they've really got honestly
still using spinning discs for those
wondering I did also try testing at
lower resolutions such as 1080p and the
results were the same as expected they
were also the same when using a slower
GPU such as the geforce gtx 960
despite the evidence I strongly
recommend gamers install less eight
gigabytes of memory in their systems
starting at just $40 for a kit with two
four gigabyte modules it doesn't make
sense to use anything less of course if
you can afford to spend a little extra
and get a 16 gigabyte kid then by all
means do so but for those on a tight
budget that 40 or 50 dollars would
certainly provide much more performance
when invested in a better GPU for
example thanks for tuning into Hardware
