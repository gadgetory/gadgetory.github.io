after putting together the budget or
rather mainstream AMD and Intel builds
over the past few weeks and I had a lot
of fun putting em together - so much so
that I've decided to dive straight into
another build log video series but this
time it's a little different for this
build there's no real budget in mind
instead the mission is to create a
really powerful 4k capable gaming rig
that will be easy to lug around to lands
or sit subtle in your living room or
bedroom ever since AMD slashed the
pricing of there are nine nano I've
wanted to include two of these cards and
a build and this mighty mini portable
build seemed like the perfect
opportunity to do so
complementing the crossfire nano cards
will be the Intel Core i7 6 or 700 km
gigabytes awesome little z170 MX gaming
5 motherboard for good measure 32
gigabytes of kingston savage ddr4 3000
memory will be included along with the
predator 240 gigabyte SSD as the boot
drive the Western Digital Black Sticks
terabyte hard drive will also be
included as a secondary storage device
all of this hardware will be built into
the Thermaltake core v 21 a neat little
micro ATX case that supports two dual
slot graphics cards which is perfect for
a set of nanos will also look extremely
cool and show off the hardware inside
cooling the 6700 kV thermal takes water
3.0 ring RGB 240 all in one closed-loop
liquid cooler and powering the system
would be thermal takes smart GPS G 750
watt power supply before we benchmark
this crossfire beast I've recorded the
build process and made a little time
last for you guys to at the end I'll
include some 3d mark firestrike results
followed by a second more in-depth
benchmark video next week so for now
bust out the popcorn and get comfortable
it's time to put this thing together
well that was fun
now I'm keen to see how the dual nanos
perform in a few of the latest triple-a
titles as well as how they go with
direct x12 performance at 4k and game
such as hitman and ashes the singularity
so that's what I'll be doing for the
next few days and you can expect to see
those results next week until then
here's a screenshot of the 3d mark
firestrike ultra score of almost 7,000
points which I believe is pretty decent
for a dual nano setup personally I don't
place too much weight on these synthetic
EP knee measuring tools but I know
firestrike ultra is a popular benchmark
so I decided to include it anyway it's a
bit of a teaser as always I'm your host
Matt and I'll see you in the benchmark
video next week
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
