bit sick this week but that's not going
to stop me from making content for you
guys last week I explained everything
you need to know about free sync to
AMD's flagship monitor technology for
the next generation of high-end HDR
gaming displays well in today's video
I'll be giving my impressions of
actually using one of these monitors for
some gaming and whether it's worth
buying a free sink to monitor right now
the monitor I've been using to test for
eating - is the Samsung c49
1890 a stupidly wide 49 inch double
1080p display with a total resolution of
3840 by 1080 it's curved with an 1800
hour curvature uses VA technology and
it's certified for display HDR 600 that
means it sports up to 600 nits of peak
brightness covers at least 90% of the
DCI p3 gamut and has basic local dimming
now while this panel doesn't support the
full display HDR 1000 with a thousand
nits of peak brightness for the optimal
HDR experience the Samsung chg 90 does
provide more than just an entry-level
HDR experience there are plenty of
supposedly HDR capable panels that
cannot push their brightness about 400
nits and do not support a wider than
srgb gama but samsung's latest quantum
dot monitors at least do provide higher
brightness and a wider gamut than basic
SDR displays unfortunately the CH g 90
does not support free sync - out of the
box despite this feature being
advertised on their website instead to
get free sync to working I needed to
download and install a firmware update
for the monitor which isn't a great
experience from a premium panel
considering this display was released
well after AMD announced routing 2 at
the start of 2017 it really shouldn't
require a firmware updates to support
the technology there will likely be many
cases where people purchase this monitor
they're hooking up to their PC without
performing any firmware updates and just
assume freesync 2 is working as intended
the fact you might need to upgrade the
firmware is not well advertised on
samsung's website it's hidden in a
footnote at the bottom of the page and
upgrading a monitors firmware isn't
exactly a common practice
if you
by a supported Samsung quantum monitor
make sure it's running the latest
firmware that supports free sync - if it
is running the right firmware the
information tab in the on-screen display
will show a free sync - logo and AMD's
graphics driver and software utility
exacerbate this issue with free sync to
display firmware while Radeon Settings
does indicate when your GPU is hooked up
to a free sync display it does not
distinguish between free sync and free
sync - there is no way to tell within
Radeon settings or any part of Windows
that your system is attached to a free
sync to display so there's no way to
check if loosing to is working whether
your monitor actually supports racing -
or whether your monitor has free sync to
enabled in fact there was no change to
the way Randi on settings' indicated
fruit sing support after i upgraded my
monitor to the free sync through
supporting firmware and indicator in
Radeon settings that lets you know when
you are connected to a free sync to
monitor would go a long way to ending
this sort of confusion particularly when
some monitors require a firmware update
to enable this feature sad is freezing
to actually work and how do you set up
well provided free sync is enabled in
Radeon settings and in the monitors on
the screen display and both are enabled
by default it should be ready to go
there is no magic toggle to get
everything working and no real
configuration options instead the key
features are either permanently enabled
like low latency and low framerate
compensation or ready to be used when
required like HDR using the HDR
capabilities of free sync to does
require you to enable HDR when you want
to use it in the case of Windows 10
desktop applications this means going
into the settings menu heading into the
display settings and enabling HDR and
WCG this which is the Windows desktop
environment to an HDR environment and
any apps that support HDR can pass their
HDR map data straight to the monitor
through HDR 10 for standard SDR apps
which currently are most Windows apps we
news 10 attempts at OMAP the SDR colors
and brightness to HDR as it can
automatically switch modes on the fly
while Windows 10 has been improving its
HDR support with each major windows
update it's still not at a point where
SDR is mapped correctly to HDR with HDR
and WCG enabled SDI apps look washed out
brightness is lacking some apps like
chrome are straight-up broken in the HDR
mode there is this slider within windows
for changing the base brightness for SDR
content however with my Samsung Tess
Mara the maximum supported brightness
for SDR in this mode is around 119 s
which is well below the monitors maximum
315 it's when HDR and WCG are disabled
now 119 it's of brightness is probably
fine for a lot of users but it's a bit
strange that the slider does not
correspond to the full brightness range
of the monitor it's also a different
controller that displays on the screen
brightness control if the - brightness
is set to less than a hundred you get
less than 119 it's when displaying SDR
content if this all sounds confusing to
you that's because it is in fact the
whole Windows desktop extra
implementation is a bit of a mess and if
you can believe it earlier versions of
Windows 10 were even worse in this
department this is the case with not
just free sync to monitors but all HTML
hooked up to Windows 10 pcs at the
moment my advice is to disable HDI WCG
when using the Windows 10 desktop and
only enable it when do you want to run
an HDR app because that way you get the
best SDR experience in the vast majority
of apps that currently don't support HDR
so how about games surely this is the
area where free sync to Myers and HDR
really shines right well it depends I
tried a range of games that currently
support HDR windows and I was largely
disappointed with the results
HJ implementations differ from game to
game it seems that right now a lot of
game developers have no idea how to
correctly tone map their games for HDR
the worst of the lot at EAS games Mass
Effect Andromeda zhj implementation was
famously shamed when HG our monitors
were first shown off but the curse of
poor HDR continues into battlefield 1
and the newest Star Wars Battlefront 2
both games exhibit washed out colors in
the HDR mode that looks far worse than
the SDR presentation compounded by a
general dark tone to the image and weak
use of HDR spectacular bright highlights
in all three of es newer games that
support HDR there is no reason
whatsoever to enable HDR as it looks so
much better in this
and an SDR mode I'm not sure why these
games look so bad because reports seemed
to suggest EA titles also look bad on
TVs with better hgr support and also on
consoles I think there is something
fundamentally broken with the way EA's
frostbite engine manages HDR and I hope
it can be resolved for upcoming games
hitman is one of the older games to
support HDR and it too does not manage
hjr well while the presentation isn't as
washed out as with EA's titles colors
are still dull and the image in general
is too dark with little if any use of
impressive highlights the idea of HJ is
to add to the color gamut and increase
the range of brightness is used but in
hitman it just seems like everything has
become darker and less intense again
this is a game if you play in the SDR
mode Assassin's Creed origins has an
interesting HJ implementation as it
allows you to modify the brightness
ranges to match the exact specifications
of your display I'm torn as to whether
the game looks better in the HDR or SDR
modes HDR appears to have better
highlights and a wide range of colors
during the day but suffers from a
strange lack of depth at night which
oddly makes night scenes feel less like
they are actually at night the SDR mode
looks better during these night periods
and is perhaps slightly behind the HDR
presentation during the day on a display
with full array local dimming which I
believe this Samsung monitor does not
have I think Assassin's Creed origins
will look better but it's not the best
HJ implementation I've seen the best
game for HDR by far is Far Cry 5 MD
tells me this is the first game that
will support free sync to SG PU side
tone mapping in the coming weeks
although right now the game does not
support this HDR pipeline instead as
with most HDR games Far Cry 5 uses HDR
10 that is passed on to the display for
further tone mapping unlike most other
games though Far Cry 5s hgr 10 is
actually quite good the color gamut is
clearly expanded to reduce more vivid
colors and we're not getting the same
washed-out look as many other HDR titles
bright highlights truly are brighter in
the HDR mode with great dynamic range
and in general this is one of the few
tiles that look substantially better in
the HDR mode so nice work Ubisoft
Middle Earth shadow of war is another
game with a decent HR implementation
when HDR is enabled this game utilizes a
noticeably wider range of colors and
highlights are brighter again there is
no issue with dark colors or a washed
out presentation which allows the HDR
mode to improve on the SDR presentation
in basically every way how you enable HJ
in these games though isn't always the
same
most of the titles have a built-in HDR
switch that overrides the windows HDR
and WCG setting so you can leave the
desktop as SDA and merely enable Hg in
the games you want to play in the HDR
mode hitman is an interesting case where
it has an HDR switch in the game
settings but will display a black screen
if the windows actually a switch is also
enabled shadow of War though has no HDR
switch at all instead to throw into the
windows HDR and WCG setting which is
annoying as you have to switch between
HDR and SDR manually to get the optimal
HDR experience in the game but a decent
SDR experience on the desktop while the
HDR experience in a lot of games right
now is pretty bad and actually a lot
worse than the basic SDR presentation I
think there is reason to be optimistic
about the future of HDR gaming on PC
some more recent games like Far Cry 5
and shadow of war have pretty decent HDR
implementations right now which improve
upon the SDR mode in noticeable ways
while many of the games they're poor HDR
implementations are somewhat older as
the HDR ecosystem matures we should see
more Far Cry fires and fewer Mass Effect
and dramatists in terms of the HJ
implementation we're also not at the
stage where any games use free sync to
use GPU side tone mapping as I mentioned
before far cry 5 will be the first to do
so in coming weeks with AMD claiming
more games scheduled for release later
this year will include free sync to
support right out of the box you'll be
interesting to see how GPU side tone
mapping turns out but it definitely has
the scope to improve the HJ
implementation for PC games however as
it stands right now I see little reason
to buy a free sync to monitor until more
games include decent HDR it's just to
hit or miss and mostly misses to be
worth a significant investment into a
first generation precinct to HDR monitor
this isn't the sort of technology to
become an early adopter in at the moment
as
in the year we should have a wider range
of HDR monitors to choose from
potentially with better support for HDR
through higher brightness levels full
array local dimming and wider gamut
by then we should also have a better
look at the HDR game ecosystem hopefully
with more games that support decent HJ
implementations that's not to say you
should avoid these Samsung quantum dots
racing 2 monitors in fact they're pretty
good as far as gaming monitors go just
don't buy them specifically for their
HDR capabilities or you might find
yourself a bit disappointed right now
that's it for this look at freesync 2 an
HDR gaming right now I'm hoping to
revisit this topic soon once we have
g-sync hgl on the market and more HDR
modernist to look at so subscribe to

gonna go have a rest and recover from
