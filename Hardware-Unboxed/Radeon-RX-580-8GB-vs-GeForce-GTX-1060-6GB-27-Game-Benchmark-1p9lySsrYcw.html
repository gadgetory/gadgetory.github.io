are revisiting the battle of the
mid-range GPUs more specifically the
Radeon rx 588 gigabyte and geforce gtx
1066 gigabyte it's been a little over a
year since we last compared these two
head-to-head in an epic 27 game battle
so i thought it's about time we've got
an update on the situation in that time
we've received multiple driver and game
updates as well as added quite a few new
games to the list of titles that we test
with of the 27 games that we are testing
in this video just six of them were
featured in last year's battle last time
at the RX 580 was 2 percent faster than
the gtx 1060 on average so i'll be
interesting to see if anything's changed
representing the green team is the
gigabyte horas gtx 1066 g 9 gigabits per
second and for the red team the gigabyte
RS RX v 8 extr 8g although both models
are pretty heavily overclocked out of
the box we're still going to try and
squeeze every last bit of performance
from them with a custom overclocked
stock the Auris RX 580 comes clocked at
fourteen hundred and twenty five
megahertz for the core and two thousand
megahertz for the gddr5 memory we were
only able to increase the core clock to
fourteen hundred and ninety megahertz
and that's a mere 5% overclock and in
the memory of two thousand two hundred
and fifty megahertz for a 13 percent
overclock as for the Auris gtx 1060 it
comes clocked at sixteen hundred and
seven megahertz for the core and 2250
megahertz for the gddr5 memory we were
able to hit seventeen hundred and ten
megahertz for the core and this resulted
in a boost frequency of nineteen hundred
and fifty megahertz depending on load
the memory also reached two thousand and
seventy five megahertz so a six percent
core overclock and a 10 percent memory
overclock now as mentioned earlier we
have 27 games in total all of which have
been tested at 1080p using both stock
and overclocked configurations
however i'm only going to discuss the
results for eight of the games and then
jump to our performance breakdown this
is a new format that i'm trying for
these GPU updates so let me know if you
prefer getting to the performance
summary a bit quicker as usual our
course a GPU test rig built inside the
crystal series
five seventy ex has been used and inside
we have a core i7 87 or okay clocked at
five gigahertz with 32 gigabytes of ddr4
3,200 memory I think that's about
everything let's get to the good stuff
first up we have battlefield one a well
optimized game that's been out for over
a year and a half now so I'm Dean NVIDIA
have had plenty of time to get there
drivers sorted and as a result it's a
very even fight basically too close to
call so let's move on the newest game
added to the long list of titles we test
with is a rec fest and it's a rare title
in the sense that there appears to have
been outside pressure on the game
developer from any team not blue red or
even the Green Team
this makes the rx5 80s 12% victory we're
looking at the average frame rate and
27% for the 1% low all that sweeter it's
possible in video we'll release an
updated driver for this title to improve
performance but for now this is how the
gtx 1060 and rx 580 stack up every time
I forget to include Rainbow six siege in
any kind of benchmark comparison you
guys let me know about it in the
comments section so I've made sure it
was included in the few games that I'm
going to discuss although both GPUs had
no trouble cranking up big framerate at
1080 PS and the ultra quality settings
the RX 580 was still 17 percent faster
hitting an impressive 146 fps out of the
box overclocking didn't really seem to
help much netting us just 2% more
performance far cry 5 was an even fight
and it's another well optimised title
that said the RX 580 did deliver
slightly better 1% low performance
making it around 8 percent faster here
still overall I have to say the
experience was much the same using
either GPU fortnight uses the Unreal
Engine and NVIDIA did have some
influence on its development so
unsurprisingly the GTX 1060 does enjoy a
performance advantage here delivering
13% more frames again the experience was
still very good with the rx 580 but for
maximum formats for tonight players will
want a graphics card from the Green Team
Total War sage Thrones of Britannia is
another recently added title and this
one delivers very competitive results
stock the GTX 1060 was only one to two
fps faster and we see much the same once
both GPUs are overclocked I have to say
it's quite
to see a radeon GPU actually winning in
arma 3 back when we first tested the
Radeon R X 480 the GTX 1060 was an
incredible 55 percent faster in this
title so clearly aim DS worked out
whatever the issue was and incredibly
we're actually seeing better 1% low
performance on the rx 580 the last game
we're going to discuss is Warhammer
vermintide 2 and it seems aimed his
recent driver update which claimed a
performance improvement of up to 10% for
the rx 588 gigabyte has given a clear
advantage in this title the RX 580 was
almost 20% fast and the GTX 1060 both
stock and overclocked so a super result
for the radio and graphics card the
great thing about the RS RX 580 XG r 8g
is it gets the most out of the RX 580
without the user really having to do
anything the bad news though is it's
very very power hungry under bolting
could help here but the results will
vary from card to card in any case
without any tinkering you're looking at
around a 25% increase in total system
consumption with this radeon GPU that's
a massive increase though it has to be
said we are using a core i7 87 or okay
clocked at 5 gigahertz and even then
total system draw under heavy gaming
load never exceeded 371 watts even with
the GPU overclocked so under 400 watts
this hardware configuration isn't
exactly putting the hurt on your PSU ok
so from that fairly small 8 game sample
we saw a bit of back and forth and I
guess that is to be expected based on
what we have seen in the past that said
though let's get the full picture now by
looking at the results across all 27
games here we can see that overall the
gtx 1066 gear by it was 3% faster on
average at 1080p which i'm sure i don't
need to tell you is a negligible margin
of the 27 games test that we see there's
almost a dozen 11 to be exact where the
margin is less than 5% in either
direction that means there were seven
games where the GTX 1060 was slower by
more than a 5 percent margin and 9 games
are us faster than a 5 percent margin
there's really only one major outlier
here and that's frost Punk where the GTX
1060 was 46% faster for those of you
wondering if we remove that title the
GTX 1060 is now just a
single percent fast in the RX 580 on
average hopefully AMD can sort out
whatever the issue is in frost Punk
before too long for those of you who are
interested in seeing the actual frame
rates for the 19 games that we didn't
look closely at please check the video
description there'll be a link included
there that'll take you to a public post
on our patreon account and that will
feature all that information right so
last time we did this the RX 580 came
out on top just on top by a 3% margin
which at the time I declared close
enough to be called a draw this time it
was the GTX 1060 that came out on top by
a 3% margin and once again I'm going to
declare this one a draw depending on the
games you play one model might be a
better choice than the other but overall
the experience was very similar in
almost every title tested last time I
did say that there was no right or wrong
choice here they're just too close to
call it so just get whichever one is
cheapest if you want to take advantage
of adaptive sync technology then the RX
580 does make more sense as free sync is
much more affordable but the experience
will vary from display to display so
make sure you do your research
personally I'd be just as happy with
either of these graphics cards I'd
happily take the GTX 1060 or the rx 580
and my advice really is just get
whichever one is cheapest in your region
right now they are both still quite
overpriced it's not as extreme as it was
you can expect to pay about $300 u.s.
for either of these models about four
hundred and fifty dollars Ozzy so not
too bad about fifty dollars overpriced
there having said all that though I'd
highly recommend you just wait if you
can if you're extremely desperate then
Shaw bio new graphics card now but if
you can wait I'd suggest doing so
because prices should continue to fall
and we are anticipating new models soon
so it might pay to wait another month or
two if you can and that is going to do
it for this one I hope you did enjoy
this video the new format you found that
was a bit more optimized anyway I'm I'll
be interested to hear what you guys
