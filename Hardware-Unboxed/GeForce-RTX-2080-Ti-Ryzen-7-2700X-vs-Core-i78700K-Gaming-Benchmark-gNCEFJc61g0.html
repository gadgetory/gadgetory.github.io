are revisiting the battle between the
horizon 7 2700 x and core i7 87 ok with
the geforce r-tx 28 ET i now later this
week I will be reviewing the Koro 9 900k
and 97 ok for the first time but before
we check out those new 8 core
coffee-like refresh parts I wanted to do
a refresh out with the 87 ok and 2700 X
now you might think this video is a bit
poorly timed but there are a few things
I wanted to explore before we jump into
testing the 9th gen core series
processors today all of our CPU data has
been collected with the GeForce GTX
today's UI which is a all good and well
but with the 9th gen processes we will
be moving on to testing exclusively with
the RT X xx atti as that is now the
fastest gaming GPU available and we
always test CPU gaming performance with
the fastest GPU available I've already
invested quite a bit of time and effort
into this testing having said that
though you may be a little surprised to
learn that we are only testing with 10
games in this video and for our initial
ninth gen coverage of course I will no
doubt add more titles to the format in
the coming weeks but for a day one
review just going over ten titles a
little own testing them is a big job and
I don't think too many people want to
sit through 30 minute video of game
breakdowns and I some of you Harbor are
box fans will bat for the day one review
I want to cover things other than just
games so 10 games is more than enough
anyway for this battle between the 8700
K and 2700 X we have 10 games that we've
selected for the upcoming 9900 K and 97
hurricane review although I'm using the
mighty RT X xx atti
I'll be showing scaling performance by
testing at 1080p 1440p and 4k this will
give you a good idea of how these CPUs
compare under realistic gaming
conditions as well as non GPU limited
scenarios
also please note for this test I'm not
using tuned secondary timings for the
2,700 X instead both processors have
been tested using Corsair Vengeance RGB
Pro ddr4 30
hundreds l14 memory with the XMP loaded
the cooler of choice is the corsair
hydro series h 100 i pro and for now we
are just looking at stock cpu results
for the most part we've found
overclocking leads to similar
performance gains for each cpu so don't
expect any noteworthy changes there
especially when going beyond 1080p other
than that everything else is up to date
the games the data Windows 10 display
and system drivers I think that's about
everything so let's jump into the
results first up we have Assassin's
Creed origins and in a moment we will
check out the more recently released
Odyssey so here we see the 87 or okay
allowed for 12% more frames than average
at 1080p 13% at 1440p and then 8% at 4k
I was quite shocked to see a measurable
performance difference at 4k that said
origins has always run a bit unusually
on the rise and processors this time
when testing with Assassin's Creed
Odyssey we are using the harbour unboxed
optimized quality settings for a full
breakdown of the settings used please
watch Tim's guide here we find slightly
different performance trends here the 87
RK was 21% faster an average at 1080p
but just 6% faster when comparing the
frame time performance so although the
Intel CPU provided a much higher average
frame rate the overall experience ended
up looking and feeling much the same the
margin did close up to just six percent
at 1440p there oddly this time the one
percent low result was 14% greater with
the 8700 K then finally at 4k as we'd
normally expect to find there's no real
differences between the two CPUs moving
on a battlefield 1 and here the 87 era K
was 12% faster on average at 1080p and
1440p while we again see no difference
in performance at the 4k resolution
previously we found the 87 era came to
be 8 % faster at 1080p using the gtx
1080i so the margins have only increased
ever so slightly with the RT x 20 atti
it appears that the 2700 X and even the
8700 K are limiting the RT X 20 80 TI at
TP so it will be very interesting to see
how much more headroom there is an offer
here with the 99er ok of course we can
still overclock but at the stock speeds
the current gen parts need to be tested
at 1440p to avoid limiting
GPU performance f1 2018 is a reasonably
CPU intensive title although the 87 are
okay allowed for 10% more frames on
average and a 12% boost to the 1% low
result with the 2,700 X we were able to
keep frame rates well over 100 FPS at
all times so it wasn't exactly easy to
spot the difference between these two
CPUs then at 1440p there's no
differentiating between the two as the
87 our cake was just 4% faster once
again by the time we reached the 4k
resolution both CPUs are enabling the
same level of performance with the r-tx
20 atti
which saw over 100 FPS at all times now
testing with project cars 2 shows very
CPU limited results at 1080p and we also
see much the same at 1440p here the 87
henrique enabled slightly higher average
framerate performance while the 2,700 X
enabled slightly better frame time
performance moving to 4k any difference
in CPU performance is completely removed
from the equation and now we see the
same frame time and average frame rate
results performance in Star Wars
Battlefront 2 was very competitive here
the 87 era came off at 8% and more
performance at 1080p and just 4% at
1440p then at 4k we see exactly the same
76 FPS on average provided by both
configurations next up we have Rainbow
six siege and here we again find
competitive results the 87 era cake was
just 7% faster today AP and 5% faster at
1440p very was 9% fast during comparing
the frame time data of course as we've
seen time and time again for those
playing at 4k there appears to be no
real performance difference between
these two CPUs the shadow of the Tomb
Raider results are quite interesting the
87 or K runs away with it for the
average framerate at 1080p alone for 26%
more frames on average and yet despite
that the frame time performance was just
9% higher the margin of course closes up
at 1440p and now we see just a 5 percent
performance advantage in favor of the
Intel CPU and then we see the exact same
performance at the 4k resolution so fair
to say under realistic gaming conditions
you can expect to find very similar
performance from both these CPUs with
the RT X xx atti
here we see when testing hit man with
the preferred DX 12 API that the
2700 X limits performance to around 80
FPS whereas the 87 okay allowed the RT X
20 atti to push up to around 100 FPS and
this can be seen at both 1080p and 1440p
even at 4k the 87 RK enjoyed a 6%
performance advantage when looking at
the average framerate so I'll Verizon
does okay here the core i7 processor is
clearly superior in this title finally
we have Forza horizon for which isn't a
particularly CPU demanding title it has
to be said but I've included a
nonetheless to show the kind of
performance margins you can expect to
see in a well-made modern title that's
mostly GPU bound as you can see nothing
particularly exciting here on the CPU
front the 2700 X match the 87 okay or at
least roughly matched it at all three
resolutions okay so here's the 10 game
average the 87 Eric 8 was 10% faster TEP
8 percent faster 1440p and just 2
percent faster at 4k basically anything
within a 5 percent margin really is too
close to call anyway as we're all well
aware at this point the 87 ok is the
superior gaming CPU it's just not
necessarily superior in terms of value I
was really expecting Intel to run away
with it more than they did in this
comparison with the GeForce r-tx 20 atti
of course this is a limited sample and
while I do plan to create one of those
30-plus game comparisons now between not
just these CPUs but also the upcoming
9th gen models and hopefully I'll get
that done within the next month or so I
think that will only extend the margin
by a few extra percent because you know
older games or less optimized games
let's say as such a csgo pubsey and GTA
5 just to name a few but there'll be a
few other ones they tend to favor the
blue team a little bit more than what
we've seen on average here I'm assuming
a good 99% of all RT X 28 ETI owners
will be gaming at no less than 1440p
with most targeting 4k that being the
case at the same price I'd probably grab
the core i7 80s or okay every time it's
unquestionably the better gaming CPU
right now and will likely remain so for
the next few years however right now it
costs roughly 370 is $390 us depending
on where you shop here in Australia it's
more like 590
meanwhile the 2700 X cost just $295 us
or four hundred and seventy dollars Ozzy
and that makes it 20% cheaper
motherboard prices are quite similar
you're looking at around a hundred and
forty dollars u.s. for the exceptionally
good MSI B 450 gaming Pro carbon while a
similar qualities and 370 board will
cost around 150 to 170 dollars u.s. then
there's also the matter of the cooler
the wraith prism is a decent box cooler
certainly better than anything I can
recall Intel shipping with their CPUs
and you will see similar performance to
what was shown in this video when using
the wraith prism the 2700 reacts only
runs about a hundred megahertz faster
with a better cooler like the corsair
hydro series edge 100 i pro that we used
in this video a cheap air cooler for the
87 or okay will cost around $30 u.s. so
you're looking at spending about a
hundred and thirty dollars us more on
the intel build which frankly overall
really isn't a huge price difference but
then it has to be said you're also
really seeing no performance increase
for that extra investment the extra
cause of the rise and cpu generally make
it better for heavy productivity tasks
but that's not always the case so make
sure you check out performance in the
applications you'll be mostly using
overall again it's a close battle with
the RT x 2080 TI and the result isn't
that different to what we saw with the
1080i back in july at the time i
compared both cpus in 35 games using the
TI and at the end of it I admitted that
I was torn on which way I'd go noting
that at the time they're both very
appealing so I guess it's somewhat of a
high-class problem at the time I didn't
feel for gaming that the two extra cause
of the 2700 X would see it nod your head
of the 87 okay at least within the next
few years and since then I have done a
few benchmarks to explore this and that
certainly does seem to be the case I did
also say though that the Ulua of that
glorious 5 gigahertz 87 hurricane
overclock would probably suck me in I
also know at the time that it really is
a tough choice picking between these two
CPUs purely for gaming performance but
if you are just gaming at the time I I
suggested that I would lean towards the
core i7 processor my opinion hasn't
changed too much but today with
increased
icing for the 8,700 cage you to supply
shortages and whatever other reasons but
yeah due to those increased prices I'd
probably leaned more towards the Rison
720 700 X now still a close one but yeah
I don't know if I'd spend the extra
money on the 8700 K now it was always
more expensive now it's just a fair bit
more expensive now that being said
though let me know which cpu you choose
and why as always I look forward to
discussing this with you guys in the
comment section below
and that is going to do it for this one
at least for now I'm keen to pick this
up again when we get the 900 K and the
9700 K and a few other ninth gen core
