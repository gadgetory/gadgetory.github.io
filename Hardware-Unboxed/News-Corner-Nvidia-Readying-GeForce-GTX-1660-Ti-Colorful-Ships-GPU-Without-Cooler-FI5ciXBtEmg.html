cornets an absolute scorcher here in
Melbourne today with forecast to reach a
maximum temperature of 44 degrees
Celsius so that's a hundred and eleven
Fahrenheit for our American friends and
the studio where I film videos is the
only room in my house that doesn't have
air conditioning so it's bloody hot in
here right now so I'm going to keep this
one as short as possible and yeah let's
get right into it so the main story from
this week concerns invidious upcoming
line of GeForce GTX churring graphics
cards seems like nvidia is having a hard
time keeping this one under wraps at
this point we've seen some leaked
photographs specifications pricing and
even launch dates so at this point it's
pre safe to say a new mid-range to
entry-level line of GPUs is coming from
Nvidia pretty soon so let's take a look
at what the leaked information is
currently saying all these new products
fall under gtx turing branding so these
are graphics cards without the
ray-tracing intensive course found in
invidious r-tx cards that seems like a
pretty simple and obvious thing to cut
when attempting to reduce the price of
cards for the budget range the gtx 1660
Ti is the highest end card apparently
built using 12 nanometer tu1 1:6 silicon
so these are not simply rebranded Pascal
cards these are new GPUs and are they
are indeed using new silicon that
features and videos cheering compute
units again this is key to note because
for any number number of CUDA cores at
ring based GPU 2 of is more performance
than a Pascal based GPU thanks to its
dedicated integer pipeline these 16 6
DTI
allegedly has 1536 CUDA cores that's
lower than the 1920 CUDA cores in the RT
X 2060 this is another move that makes
sense and video wouldn't want to simply
make a cheaper version of the RT X 2060
without our text functionality because
gamers would just buy that over the RT X
enabled version putting price on ray
tracing would be a bad move in sales if
the 2060 would probably tank overnight I
think a lot of people were hoping Nvidia
would release a 2060 without ray tracing
at a lower price but these rumors
suggest that won't happen in any case
the GTX 16-6 DTI also has six gigabytes
of gddr5 it bus no word on clock speeds
there was also a geforce gtx 1660 also
using the tu1 1:6 GPU but with a
cut-down 1280 CUDA cores the 1616 non TI
uses gddr5 memory either 6 gigabytes or
3 gigabytes depending on the model again
no word on clock speeds for this device
it's hard to say exactly how the GPUs
will perform but judging from the coup
de coeur count and increased performance
of the chewing SM the 1660 ti should be
a decent amount faster than the gtx 1066
gigabyte probably up there around gtx
1070 level and then the 1660 should also
be a bit faster than the 1066 gigabyte
depending on clock speeds information
from hard OCP suggests the gtx 1660 TI
will launch on February 15th at 279 US
dollars while the GTX 1660 will come a
few weeks later in early March at 229 US
dollars how does if he also suggests
there is a gtx 1650 on the way in late
March for 179 dollars a new card that
hasn't been spoken about in detail yet
so we don't know any specifications at
this point while a lot of this
information still falls into the rumor
category we have been able to confirm
several aspects with that industry
sources the timeline hard OCP is
suggesting for the launchers is spot-on
with what we're hearing with the gtx
1660 TI to come first in mid february
the naming scheme as well seems locked
in as gtx 1660 which honestly isn't a
good name in my opinion but whatever the
gtx 660ti should probably be called the
gtx 2050 TI and the gtx 1660 the gtx
2050 but gtx 1660 seems to be locked in
at this point we've also heard that the
1660 Ti isn't simply an RT X 2060 with
that ray tracing so while we haven't
seen any firm specifications this does
adds support for the 1660 Ti using a t1
1:6 GPU with fewer cuda cores than the
2060 and we've heard it isn't a Pascal
refreshed rather it's using new silicon
we haven't heard anything about pricing
but overall it looks like the bulk of
this room is attending towards being
the second rumor for today is a pretty
simple one to go over some people
discovered alleged Radeon Navi GPUs in a
Mac OS update file in a file named AMD
Radeon 6000 HW services K X references
to Nabi 1690 12 Navi 10 and Navi 9 were
spotted it has been speculated these
could refer to different Naveed VPS with
different compute unit counts or
something else entirely
however what's actually going on here is
that these aren't references to Navi 16
or Navi 12 in the code dump the numbers
are just separators and other parameters
used in C++ they are not related to the
previous string so in actual fact these
aren't references to separate Navi GPUs
the file does indeed mention Navi but
not any specific GPUs unfortunately
moving on to some non room a news we
have the colourful GeForce r-tx 2080 ti
advanced water-cooled board this is a
version of the 2080 try being sold
without a cooler for those that plan on
adding a water block for custom cooling
later for enthusiasts this is a pretty
neat idea you get a card that ships
without a cooler saving you the hassle
of removing the cooler any risk of
damaging the card in the process and
perhaps you'll save a few dollars if the
card is cheaper than other models there
right now we don't really know the price
however selling a card that doesn't work
straight out of the box is a pretty bold
move if the card is the cheapest
20/80 TI on the market for example this
could tempt novice builders into buying
it thinking it will just work as is and
that it could end in disaster
anyway the PCB used t appears to be the
standard founders edition design so it
should be compatible with a lot of
aftermarket water blocks for the 2080 ti
it's a fairly standard looking 2080 TI
just without the cool attached a niche
product for sure but something that may
tempt some builders Anandtech have
reviewed the first double-height ddr4
modules on the market these new modules
provide 32 gigabytes of ddr4 on a single
stick achieving this through basically
just adding more DRAM dies on to the
wine board to fit in all these extra
dies the height of the modules has to be
increased hence the name double-height
the benefit to these modules is of
course increased memory density in
particular systems that have only two
DIMM slots have the ability to now
support
64 gig of ram through to 32 gig sticks
rather than the old limit of 32 gig
through to 16 gig sticks however there
are a few catches the memory has to be
qualified for motherboards on a per
board basis so they won't just work with
every board currently they're only work
with three isuzu ROG boards the extra
height can also cause issues for some
calls particularly air coolers they
expand out over the memory slots so
liquid cooling is recommended here the
good news is an antique found no
performance differences from the new
module design and power consumption per
gigabyte was in line with other sticks
naturally each stick consumes more power
in general as there are double the
components but there were no real
differences between using these sticks
compared to 216 gig sticks for example
pricing for 2 times 32 gigabyte kits
expected to be roughly in line with 4
times 16 gigabyte kits so yeah no real
premium for those 32 gig modules Samsung
has launched a new SSD the 970 Evo plus
like the existing 970 Evo this is a PCIe
nvme SSD in an MDOT two form factor
using Samsung's TLC net the difference
between the 970 Evo and 970 Evo plus is
the amount of layers for the TLC net the
older Evo uses 4th gen vena and with 64
layers while the new Evo plus is using
5th gen stuff with 96 layers
they've also been some control upgrades
these drives come in at essentially the
same price as the 970 Evo they replace
90 bucks for the 250 gig model 130 bucks
for the 500 gig and 250 dollars for one
turbine the 970 vote is also slightly
faster across the board from the reviews
I've looked at so it's basically a minor
upgrade in performance for the same
price and it's still one of the fastest
consumer nvme drives on the market in
other Samsung related news the company
will begin mass producing a 15.6 inch 4k
OLED display for laptops next month at
CES we did hear from a number of vendors
that were planning to release 15-inch
laptops with all their displays and I
suspect most of those will be using this
very Samsung OLED panel when it's ready
later in the year for specs we're
looking at a 4k resolution up to 600
nits of brightness are 120,000 to 1
contrast ratio 100% DCI p3 coverage and
display hgr true black certification
there's no word on refresh rate but it
expects 60 Hertz here there's no
doubting that OLED is a very attractive
display technology thanks to its
excellent color reproduction black
levels viewing angles and overall size
and cost slimmer bezels and thinner
devices the main concern for using old
LEDs as monitors is burning so it'll be
interesting to see how this panel copes
with that lingering issue of all Ed's
phone topic for this week we have the as
rocker Radeon 17 gaming which looks well
exactly the same as a meze reference
design except with a few asrock stickers
on the fans so yeah it seems like this
is what board partners we're doing for
their Radeon 7 or ins I wouldn't be
expecting any custom designs and who
knows maybe AMD's new triple fan cooler
doesn't need replacing with something
better anyway
so that's it for this week's news corner
it's well probably close to a billion
degrees in his I'm gonna get out here
have some water cooled down the good
news is my office where I edit this
video has air concert I won't be
sweating in there as much as always you
