World Congress 2018 ran our video on the
show floor in Barcelona taking a look at
a whole bunch of different things that
have been launched at the show of course
a big show for smartphone or other
mobile device watches and to kick things
off we're going to take a look at the
biggest launch of the show the new
Samsung Galaxy S 9 had plenty of
hands-on time at the event and while
it's not the biggest update ever as far
as smartphones go it does pack some neat
features as far as the design is
concerned the 5.8 inch s8 and the six
point two inch si plus fuel very similar
to the last gen Galaxy s8 wine with
curved glass on both sides and metal rim
all the good features of the previous
phone return including the microSD card
slot and headphone jack however this new
s9 does alter the position of the
fingerprint reader such that you won't
put grime on the camera lense every time
you try to reach up and use it the key
new feature is the adjustable aperture
main camera which actually modifies the
aperture physically rather than in
software like a lot of dual lens
smartphones the auto mode will choose
between F 2.4 F 1.5 apertures depending
on the lighting conditions with the
wider F 1.5 preferred in low-light and
you'll use the F 2.4 in daylight you can
also choose an aperture yourself in the
manual mode and there's noticeably more
bokeh from the F 1.5 lens so a neat
little feature there this is a feature
I've been waiting for in smartphone
cameras for a while so I'm really
excited the galaxy s 9 is the first to
include something like this also new to
the camera is a 960 frames per second
slow motion mode at a 720p resolution
this is all made possible by the latest
Sony CMOS sensors which include DRM
snacked into the sensor module for
extremely fast capture speeds of both
photos and these slow-motion videos the
slow-motion effect is very cool though
the latest Sony flagships do the same
thing at a higher resolution more on
that later the s9 accruals to do a
whopping 4 K capture
120 frames per second which is a bit
crazy I should also mention the s9 plus
is the only phone of the two that
includes a second telephoto
providing a two-time Zune on a 12
megapixel sensor with optical image
stabilization in fact both cameras at 12
megapixels with oh is Samsung has been a
fair bit of time at their launch event
on their an emoji ripoff called AR
emojis the feature allows you to create
a cartoony 3d version of yourself that
mimics your expressions though it's
pretty uncanny valley and often doesn't
work all that well and replicating your
appearance
once again the Galaxy S nine comes in
both Qualcomm and Exynos variants for
different markets those in the US China
and a few other select markets will get
the Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 inside while
those in other regions will get the
Samsung Exynos 9 810 there will be some
performance and battery life differences
as always they're both variants packed
roughly the same cellular connectivity
from their integrated modems the s9 also
includes stereo speakers for the first
time with the bottom firing speaker
combining with the speaker above the
display for a better audio experience it
was hard to gauge just how good these
speakers are in loud hands-on area at
the Samsung event but it's nice to
finally see the Galaxy line moving away
from the single terrible speaker of the
past Samsung are still using 29 60 by
1440 AMOLED screens for their galaxy s 9
devices and there's no word on whether
these are improved in any way from the
previous iterations they looked great at
the event but once again we'll need to
do a bit more testing at a later date
that's really it for the Samsung Galaxy
S 9 again not a massive upgrade the main
things of course being those adjustable
apertures for the camera design very
similar as I said earlier so this would
be a very popular release of deal I
would think especially with a lot of
those camera updates but yeah isn't
really revolutionizing anything too much
there from Samsung one of the coolest
devices I saw the show is the huawei
mate book X Pro the key selling point
here is the thirteen point nine inch 3k
full view display with extremely thin
bezels leading to a 91% screen to body
ratio the laptop looks awesome with such
slim bezels thinner than the Dell XPS 13
by fairway display quality is bright up
to 415 it's an excellent quality plus I
prefer the 3:2 aspect ratio for laptops
to you know the standard 16:9 its
high-performance too with an Intel Core
i5
8250 you or I 78550 you and discreet
nvidia geforce MX 150 graphics
it seems this you will be getting a lot
more 13-inch ultra things with this
intel + nvidia combination which would
be a real challenger ii am these rise
and mobile chips
despite this hardware the made book x
pro also includes a 57 watt hour battery
which is you know fairly typical for
this sort of laptop in other words you
know the battery size is not hampered by
the discrete GPU taking up physical
space inside the build quality is
outstanding if you love thin metal
classes you'll love the mate book x pro
it's a very solid chassis yet waste just
one point three three kilos and comes in
at under 15 millimeters thick
this isn't you know particularly amazing
for a 13-inch laptop however it is good
to see why we didn't unnecessarily push
for slimness instead ensuring a decent
battery capacity and plenty of
performance there are a couple of
downsides I had some hands-on time with
the unit and the keyboard has a pretty
shallow travel distance similar to the
latest Mac books which may get
irritating after long periods of use
there's also an unusual pop-up camera in
between the f6 and f7 keys which allows
Y way to get such slim bezels however
the angle is just as bad as the Dell XPS
13 in my opinion so definitely some
compromises there I'm not sure there's a
good solution for webcams with slim
bezel laptops but as someone that rarely
uses the webcam I don't really care all
that much the laptop looks outstanding
in person could be one of the best
ultra-thin laptops of the year however
it won't be cheap starting at 1499 euros
for a core i5 eight gig of ram and a 256
gig SSD you'll definitely need to pay
for the design with this one why we also
showed off the media pad m5 which is a
high-end 8.4 or 10.5 inch Android tablet
powered by Huawei / gen cura 960 SOC
I used it briefly and it's really well
built with great performance but Android
tell it's even a thing anymore it's
actually pretty surprising Huawei has
released a high in Android tablet in
2018 but I guess there's enough demand
for that sort of product clearly the
star wars MWC either the new mate book
though the media pad may interest you in
a handful of people
another major launch at MWC was the Sony
Xperia x10 2 and the XZ 2 compact with
Sony choosing to increase the amount of
letters and numbers used in their
flagship handset name perhaps for the
worst while the general design of these
handsets remains similar to the Xperia
XZ and the experience that lines evolved
Sony has moved with the times and they
have chosen to use an 18 9 aspect ratio
display with these handsets
unfortunately it is just a 1080p class
resolution 2160 by 1080 to be specific
which is overshadowed by the 1440p
resolutions we see on a lot of other
flagships these days however does
support HDR including SDR to HDR
enhancements through Sony's x-reality
engine it's a feature that's never
really impressed me all that much in the
past but SDR 2 HD I should produce
better results than just crappy
saturation boost like their views
previously moving to an 18 9 display has
led to slimmer bezels but we're still
not in the same realm as the best slim
bezel handsets currently available Sony
phones have always had very chunky
bezels though so these new XZ 2 handsets
are a big improvement in this regard the
rear of the Xperia x2 has changed a fair
bit compared to its predecessor moving
to a glossy glass panel with sloping
edges and a centered camera the design
reminds me a fair bit of HTC s latest
smartphones as well as the old Nokia
Lumia handsets I reckon the lowdown
camera position could get a bit annoying
and easy this much during usage though
so something to watch out for annoyingly
there is no headphone jack on these
handsets though you do get a USB C port
and a micro SD card slot and while the
camera is largely unchanged from a
hardware perspective compared to the XF
premium from last year there are two
cool new additions HDR video recording
which is a first for any smartphone and
upgrade to the 960 frames per second
slow motion mode that allows it to cat
in 1080p while we are getting 9 60fps
women with the galaxy s 9 it won't be
able to match the clarity of what's
provided with the ex said to and from
what I used of the murdered MW see it
produces some stunning imagery the exit
2 is also capable of 3d selfie simply
move the front around your head in this
selfie mode and will capture a full 3d
model of your face that you can
manipulate unlike the galaxy s 9s they
are emojis this feature works really
well and actually produces lifelike
models it's a neat feature that I'm not
quite sure what the real-world use case
is it seems like one of those things
it's cool in demos but not practically
useful performance wise we're looking at
a snapdragon 845 with both the XZ 2 and
X sent to a compact getting essentially
the same hardware across the board
including the camera these phones are
extremely snappy and support gigabit LT
either of course the snapdragon 845 will
be coming to plenty of phones this year
on the XZ 2 compacts specifically I was
surprised how chunky the phone felt to
use it's a lot thicker than the standard
5.7 inch XZ 2 however with such a small
5 inch display and very little
competition in the small high-end phone
market the Compaq should once again be
highly attractive to a certain segment
of phone bias no word on pricing for
these phones however they do seem like
some of Sony's best devices in a while
I'm a bit concerned that there haven't
been many camera updates outside of the
new HDR and slow-motion features but the
design changes are a step in the right
direction hopefully a few people
actually buy these handsets this time
sony has struggled in that regard in the
past as for LG no major launchers at MWC
this year no g7 or anything like that
but we did get the LG V 30s think queue
which I honestly don't know why this is
a product that actually exists it is
just no GV 30 with slightly more RAM and
storage complete with new AI driven
camera features that are being back
ported to the LTV 30 so yeah considering
is just the same hardware otherwise down
to the chassis display battery and SOC
it still uses the Qualcomm Snapdragon
835 it's
stranger than need to release this
interim device at all they should have
just released a new high-capacity v30
call it the same thing and released a
software update to all V 30s that pushes
the AI camera to also yeah not quite
sure what LG is doing with the think
queue and has a very strange prog name
as well if you aren't interesting the
air camera features basically it
analyzes the scene and the objects
within to determine which camera mode is
the most appropriate to get the best
shot it can detect objects in the can
preview and puts text on the screens let
you know what things are kind of neat to
see it in action and there's also a new
ultra bright low light mode that
improves what the V 30 was offering
before but again these features are
being back ported to the V 30 so yeah
not a really significant launch here for
LG and hopefully we'll see some of these
AI camera features come to their
upcoming flagship launches throughout
the rest of the year you know a
successor of the g6 and a real successor
to the V 30 anyway that's it for this
first look video at some of the things
I've been doing at Mobile World Congress
2018 still a lot to look at at the show
we'll be back later in the week with
another secondary ran up video you'd
have to say looking at some of the other
things I've seen so far at the show so
yeah as always check back on Hardware
inboxed and tech spot for more content
from Mobile World Congress and I'll
catch you in the very next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
