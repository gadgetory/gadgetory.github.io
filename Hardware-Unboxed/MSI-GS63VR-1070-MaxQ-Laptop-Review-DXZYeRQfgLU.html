hardware unboxed it's been a while since
I've appeared on the channel but I'm
back with a look at one of my favourite
MSI gaming laptops the msi ge62 VR
stealth pro and for the aziz and new
zealanders watching this video you might
be interested in the giveaway i'll be
discussing at the end
spoiler alert we're giving away one of
these laptops thanks to msi but before
then let's take a look at the GS 63 VR
now the Gina 63 has been on the market
in a variety of variants for a couple of
years but this particular model includes
something special nvidia geforce gtx
1070 max-q graphics previously this
laptop was restricted to just a gtx 1060
so it's awesome to see msi bumping this
up to the power of a 1070 you know with
the help of nvidia in the very same
relatively thin and light design as for
other hardware all the usual stuff an
Intel Core i7 7700 HQ 16 gig of ram a
256 gig SSD and a 2 terabyte hard drive
configurations like this er priced
around $2,000 or about 3400 in Australia
which is a bit pricey compared to the
most basic gtx 1070 laptops
however these basic laptops tend to be
pretty chunky usually around 25
millimeters thick and 2 point 2
kilograms heavy the GS 63 is 17 point
seven millimeters thick and one point
eight kilograms heavy so it's
significantly more portable even though
you still need to lug around that 600
gram power brick to the Gio 63 VR
doesn't just have a portability
advantage it's also one of MSI's best
designs the slim aluminium alloy chassis
looks great because it doesn't go
completely overboard with gamers style
though there are some angles that it
does have a few more gamer e red
highlights and yep there's a three zone
AHA GB backlit keyboard as well so MSO i
can hit all of those 2017 buzzwords do
you love IO well the GS 63 has you
covered with basically everything for
USBA ports Thunderbolt three HDMI mini
DisplayPort Ethan
SD card slot and 2 3.5 ml I do Jax but
do you want really good laptop speakers
because you might want to choose a
different laptop also what's up with
this strange power button placement bit
odd having it on that corner of the
laptop MSI are still using its
SteelSeries keyboards for their laptops
in this case one with a numpad the
layout is good and the typing experience
is acceptable with a spongy but
serviceable feel to each key you know
it's perfectly fine for gaming the
trackpad on the other hand it's not
great which is thoroughly unsurprising
considering its from ELN you know you
want to use an external mouse and save
yourself the frustration of this
trackpad if you plan on doing any sort
of serious gaming the display is exactly
what you'd want on a gaming laptop with
this hardware inside its a 15.6 inch
1080p IPS LCD with the refresh rate of
120 Hertz that last point is important
as the gtx 1070 you know it's typically
capable of gaming above 60fps of 1080p
ultra settings the extra smoothness and
fluidity provided by 120 hertz refresh
is noticeable in a lot of situations
though it's a little disappointing
there's no g-sync support but the big
thing that you're all interested in of
course is going to be the performance so
let's talk about that in terms of the
CPU and RAM the combination of the i7
and 7700 HQ and 16 gig of ram is
basically you know standard for gaming
laptops these days so it's no surprise
that GS 63 matches the performance of
similar systems in CPU heavy benchmarks
you know it's so similar I'm not going
to bore you with the graphs that don't
show anything interesting but you can
see a couple of examples right here
before I look at the GTX 970 max Q GPU
though he's a quick look at storage
performance the hard drive is glacially
slow in a massive shock to no one but
the SSD it's very quick it's a samsung
PM 961 256 gig in my case which has
excellent sequential read and write
performance and very good random
performance there's not a whole lot of
available space for games hence the hard
drive that's included but if you do
install apps on it you won't be
disappointed with how it performs so the
gtx 1070 max qg
here's the key piece of new hardware
here and it's slightly different to the
standard gtx 1070 we see in other gaming
laptops
unlike other mobile ten seventies max-q
designated ten seventies have to hit
specific noise power and thermal targets
all related to the cooler as max-q
laptops are slim the cooler isn't that
beefy so it can't dissipate as much heat
as thicker laptops as a result the gtx
1070 max cube may not necessarily max
out at the rated TDP at all times and on
top of this nvidia is 40 DB a cooler
noise limit prevents fans from imitating
jet engines to compensate for the small
heatsink so what does all of this mean
well in simpler terms it means the max q
gtx 1070 variant typically doesn't reach
the same performance levels as this
standard 1070 both GPUs are physically
identical with the same specs like 2048
CUDA cores a rated boost clock of 164 5
megahertz but max Q leads to a different
power and clock speed profile so let's
jump right into some games look at
performance starting with one of the
highest selling games of all time Grand
Theft Auto 5 at maximum settings this
title is relatively hard to run on
laptops though the GTX 970 max Q exceeds
75 FPS on average here performance is
similar to the standard gtx 1070 in the
associate over to vs on average though
it falls behind in 1% lows but all up
are very playable experience on the GS
63 rise of the Tomb Raider is a
punishing game at maximum detail levels
and it's in this game that the gtx 1070
max q slots in nicely between the gtx
1070 and gtx 1060 the 1070 is 31% faster
while the 1070 max-q is itself 22%
faster than the gtx 1060 with 1% lows
below 30fps is unlikely you want to play
on these specific settings though Deus
Ex mankind divided is another game where
the 1070 max Q sits between the standard
1070 and 1062 average results using the
ultra preset there's an 8 to 10 FPS gap
separating the 1070 match to you from
GPUs on either side and 1% those are
decent you know
without being outstanding hitman is
known to be a cpu demanding game but
this doesn't seem to be the issue
holding back the gtx 1070 max-q
again we're seeing a similar split
between the 1070 1070 mac sakura 1060
were looking at 1% lows you can see the
CPU limited nature in the Auris x5 these
seven results which come in a fair way
ahead of other gtx 1070 laptops due to
that faster HK series cpu but
civilization 6 is the most CPU limited
game in this set of benchmarks hence the
gtx 1070 max you performing around the
same levels as the standard 1070 and
even the 1068 x playable though a faster
cpu definitely helps a lot in this game
watchdogs 2 is one of the strongest
results for the 1070 max-q the fully
fledged 1070 is just 8% faster while the
1070 max-q clocks in 26% ahead of the
1060 with an average result of 47 FPS
using the ultra preset you may want to
turn down the quality levels to hit that
golden 60fps mark but there's no
stuttering or frame patient issues even
at this quality Mass Effect Andromeda
was a flop but it's not a bad game to
benchmark particularly inside the
surprisingly demanding tempest area
anyway we're seeing 13% more performance
than the 1060 here which is okay though
it does allow the GS 63 VI to hit a 60
FPS average jump onto a planet and you
will see better frame rates prayed it's
one of my favorite games of the year and
it runs really well on laptops the gtx
1070 max q he hits a 1% low above 60 FPS
in our test with an average of 90 FPS
super soil results here you also get a
fair bit more performance than gtx 1060
25% more to be exact the final game I
have a chart for is shadow of war a very
disappointing tile with a horrendous
ground war end game I push myself
through this game story but the ending
is just so bad anyway it runs reasonably
well on the gtx 1070 max q despite the
punishing requirements of the high
resolution texture pack if you turn down
the settings from ultra to height you
will hear
60 FPS 1% low and there's no chance of
this last game just yet but I did play
some Assassin's Creed origins on the
system and found you can run on the
ultra high preset with a 1% load of
around 35 fps much more enjoyable game
than shadow of war by the way if you are
thinking of choosing you know a current
iteration get in time to digest all the
gaming results the main thing to note
here is the gtx 1070 max-q provides a
very similar relative experience of the
GTX 1080
max-q the 1080 max cuse at almost
exactly between the 1070 and 1080 when
averaged across the games I tested with
it's a similar story with the 1070 max
key looking at average frame rates the
standard 1070 was 17.8% faster than the
1070 max-q on average while the 1070 max
Q is 20.8% faster than the standard 1070
on average these figures improved in
favor of the gtx 1070 max q when looking
at 1% lows here the 1070 max Q was 28.6%
faster than the 1060 while the 1070 was
just 11.5% faster but all up you can in
general expect performance between the
1070 and 1062 overclock which is
something I didn't cover here so what
about thermals and noise well the genus
63 VR produces similar thermals to a lot
of gaming laptops I've tested in
watchdogs to the CPU hit in 92 degrees
while the GPU satyr and 81 degrees after
a long period of gaming but the GS 63 is
also reasonably quiet achieving 43 DBA
from 50 centimeters away yeah this is 3
DB a higher than invidious max Q
specifications but it's still pretty
quiet compared to other gaming laptops
chuck on some ingame audio through
headphones or speakers and you can't
hear this system at full blast which is
a really good result there could be some
room for overclocking here considering
the low maximum fan speeds but that's
something you'll have to export if you
buy one of these laptops and should you
buy one well that depends on what you
want from a gaming laptop there are
cheaper gtx 1070 laptops out there even
from msi themselves that provide better
gaming performance the difference in
price is as much
as $600 in some cases so if you want the
best performance and don't care about
form-factor get one of those gtx 1070
laptops instead but if you want
something portable the g63 VR is a great
choice it's the same price as the gtx
1070 max-q variant of the assuages
heiress but you don't have to deal with
the awkward keyboard position it's $250
more than the gtx 1060 version of the GS
63 but twenty to thirty percent faster
it beats the razor blade to offering
more performance at the same price
combine these factors and you end up
with a great portable gaming laptop
purchase now what about that giveaway I
