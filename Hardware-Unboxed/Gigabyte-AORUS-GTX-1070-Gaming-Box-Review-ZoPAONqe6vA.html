unbox so ultrabooks here are by far the
most popular category of laptops for
running enough performance to everyday
tasks in a compact portable form factor
but there's one crucial thing that these
thin and light machines are incapable of
and that's high-performance PC gaming
most people looking to game on their PC
will examine a few options desktop PCs
are the best choice in price and
performance perspective but they simply
aren't portable and can't replace what
an ultrabook does gaming laptops are
portable equivalent though that are
almost always larger and heavier than an
ultra portable for a decent level of
power plus they tend to be pretty
expensive a new option for PC gaming has
started to appear over the last few
years and that is external graphics
boxes which connect to a laptop and
provide the power of a fully fledged
graphics card when you're at your desk
but still allow you to carry around a
thin and light ultra portable on the go
a couple of options and hidden markets
so far starting with the proprietary
arian where graphics amplifier and later
with the razor core the problem with the
amplifier and the core are their price
the core is of particular interest
because it's compatible with many
laptops by a thunderbolt three but it
costs a whopping 500 bucks and that's
without an include graphics card this
makes the total cost of external laptop
graphics a very expensive proposition
especially if you want decent power from
something like an nvidia geforce gtx
1070 this is where the Auris gtx 1070
gaming box comes in it offers a similar
features to the razor core it's an
external desktop graphics card enclosure
that connects two laptops vice
underworld 3 but it cost just $600 with
a gtx 1070 included inside the razor
core with equivalent hardware would set
you back at least $300 more the gtx 1070
gaming box which you can see over here
is a much more compact unit than either
the graphics amplifier or the core and
that's because it uses a gigabyte
geforce gtx 1070 mini ITX OC along with
the slimline 450 watt 80 plus gold power
supply this does restrict the upgrade
ability of unit but it
it's small and portable at just 2.4
kilograms you can pretty easily carry
around the entire unit with the provided
carry bag and its small footprint is
suitable for any desk setup setting up
and using the gaming box is extremely
simple in fact I was expecting it to be
so much harder to get working than it
actually is all you have to do is plug
in the power cord connected to your
laptop via Thunderbolt 3 let your
laptop's Thunderbolt 3 Drive utility
automatically set up the unit with a few
prompts and then install in videos
GeForce graphics driver that's pretty
much it there the gaming box works
exactly as you'd expect when running a
game it automatically switches from
using internal graphics to the external
gtx 1070 and passes the display signal
back to the laptops display if you hook
up an external monitor that works even
better with a small performance
advantage and of course you can use the
rear USB ports to attach your keyboard
and mouse the unit is fully
plug-and-play with no on/off switch when
you plug in the gaming box the unit will
automatically power up and your setup
will switch to the external graphics
where required disconnect the box and
there's a smooth transition back to
using the integrated graphics and thanks
to power delivery / Thunderbolt 3 the
gaming box charges your laptop while
connected where supported with up to 100
watts of juice I'm expecting to have
some sort of struggle using this device
for gaming or some sort of issue with
plug-and-play but that wasn't the case
at all in fact it worked perfectly with
my cable a powered one / ThinkPad x1
carbon which you'll see throughout this
video oh and there's a quick note on the
noise and thermals produced by the game
box just before we get into the
performance under load the box is pretty
quiet thanks to its large cooling vents
on either side providing enough airflow
such as the fans and have to spin up
significantly unfortunately though there
is a bit of coil whine from the power
supply noticeable when the GPU is fully
utilized as for temperatures the GPU
system comfortably around 70 degrees
Celsius under load which is what you
expect from this sort of desktop
graphics card so before I get into
discussing any performance information
let's talk about the test setup I use
the gaming box with base level ultra
portable Hardware Lenovo s10
at x1 carbon kitted out with an Intel
Core i5 7200 new processor and 8
gigabytes of RAM Ora says you will want
to gain with any lower hardware and I
definitely agree this is pretty much the
entry-level ultra portable experience
the core i5 7200 u is particularly
interesting here because it's a 2 quart
4 thread 15 watt CPU clocked at 2.5
gigahertz with a boost speed of 3.1
gigahertz this isn't as fast CPU by any
stretch in fact it's slower than the
intel pentium g 4560 which we recommend
for budget pc gaming builds as we'll
talk about later the CPU can often run
us into a bit of trouble here so testing
the gtx 1070 box i first decided to run
every game i wanted to play on just the
laptops integrated graphics to see if
even a single game was playable on the
lowest possible settings as you'll see
in this list a couple of games like
Batman Arkham Knight refused to play at
all on integrated graphics while others
like Deus Ex mankind divided and The
Witcher 3 were completely unplayable
even at 720p low settings the only two
games are considered playable with
Sleeping Dogs and tomb raider both games
from around 5 years ago and only when
set to the lowest possible quality I
think it's pretty safe to say an
ultraportable is not a gaming machine
though most of you out there have
probably we've already known that so
let's go through what the performance I
actually achieved with the gtx 1070
gaming box hooked up to my laptop i use
an external monitor for all of the
gaming box testing as it provided a few
extra frames per second as it didn't
have to send the display signal
bathrooms on the ball free cable and all
the captures have seen this video we're
done by a shadow play for convenience
note that shadow play on limited
hardware did come with the performance
set which you'll see in the captures
though i'll be discussing my experience
playing these games without the capture
running so starting off with batman
arkham knight which was very playable on
the gaming box set to 1080p ultra
settings with no game works the in-game
benchmark spirit at 877 FPS average and
flying around in the game was excellent
especially as the game simply refused to
run on integrated graphics
Deus Ex mankind divided only achieved 20
frames per second
best on integrated graphics but with the
gaming box I push this up to 55 FPS with
1080p high detail settings switching to
ultra came with the 10 FPS performance
hit pushing into the 40 FPS zone so I
prefer to use the high settings instead
I get a very playable experience here
fallout 4 is the worst optimized game I
tested with so I opted to use 1080p
ultra detail settings with shadow
distance set to medium which helps solve
some random slowdowns throughout the
game frame rates did fluctuate a fair
bit depending on where I was playing and
needed a CPU nor GPU were pegged at 100%
utilization so I mostly achieve 50 to 60
FPS of these settings or integrated
graphics again the game is pretty much
unplayable prey isn't a hugely demanding
game on gaming hardware though it's
still unplayable an integrated graphics
but with the gaming box
I was hitting around 50 to 70 FPS or
maximum quality settings depending on
the area of the ship I was in this is
another game that runs really well on
the external graphics solution at 1080p
of the two older titles I tested with
sleeping dogs hid around 90 FPS in the
in-game benchmark running at 1080p ultra
settings tomb raider hit a playable 80
FPS 1080p ultra settings again with four
times super sample anti-aliasing both of
these games were playable at 720p low
settings but the jump up to 1080p ultra
with better frame rates is massive as
you might have noticed throughout many
of these tests the CPU is pegged at 100%
utilization or close to it for most of
the game while the GPU isn't always
being fully utilized so with The Witcher
3 I decided to test about 1080p and
1440p and it wasn't hugely surprising to
see just a three to five FPS drop moving
from 1080p to 1440p but running its
1440p ultra settings with no hair works
beginning box doing it around 45 fps I
also tested Mass Effect Andromeda about
1080p and 1440p it's a roughly 7 FPS
drop when increasing the resolution and
ultra detail settings the game didn't
get past the loading screens on
integrated graphics so being able to hit
45 or FPS or thereabouts with the gaming
box is a decent effort there was one
game though that remained unplayable on
both the integrated graphics and the
gaming box and that's battlefield one 64
player multi
there is a massive CFU bottleneck while
playing which limited the framerate
around 25 to 35 FPS at all times when I
was playing on 1080p medium settings or
1440p ultra settings
I seriously plot tried to play this game
for a long time but it's bloody hard
when the frame rates are dipping below
30fps oh and it wouldn't be a proper
look at gaming performance without
mentioning eSports games
I don't normally play these sort of
titles but I did download csgo in the
laptop just to see how the gaming box
group improve the experience I was
surprised to discover are not
particularly intensive title like csgo
is largely unplayable and integrated
graphics only hitting 40 fps on 720p low
settings but when switching to 1080p low
settings on the gaming box we push that
well into the 150 to 200 FPS level which
i think is what most people like to see
aside from the unfortunate battlefield 1
multiplayer result the general
experience provided by the gtx 1070
gaming box here is very good it
comfortably transforms the ThinkPad x1
carbon and similar Thunderbolt 3
equipped ultra portables into a capable
gaming machine for the most part the
graphically intensive games I tested
were playable at 1080p or even 1440p at
high to ultra detailed settings with
respectable framerate however many of
the tests ran into CPU bottlenecks
thanks to the relatively weak core i5
7200 you are used for testing often this
left the gtx 1070 underutilized so i'd
expect you to get a better experience
with a faster core i7 7500 u which has a
13% higher boost frequency even better
results will be had with a quad-core CPU
like the i7 7700 HQ though not many
laptops without dedicated graphics use
that cpu due to the cpu bottleneck and
your expectations of gaming on a gtx
1070 i'm sure you have a number of
questions about the gaming box's
performance which i'll try to address
right now you're probably wondering how
the gaming box hooked up to an
ultraportable compared to an actual
gaming laptop with a gtx 1070 inside
i've run a few tests and it seems there
with a much faster quad-core cpu and no
potential funderbolt free concerns a gtx
1070 gaming laptop is around 30 to 40
percent faster on average than my test
system though this mountain decreases
those games are more GPU limited a fully
fledged gaming desktop with an over
cocked core i7 7700 K and a gtx 1075
will outperform the Ultrabook plus
gaming box combination by a larger
margin somewhere around 40 to 45 percent
on average and of course that will make
games like Battlefield 1 multiplayer
actually playable I haven't followed up
videos soon that we'll look more closely
at the differences between the external
gaming box like this Oris unit and a
similar gaming laptops and desktop so
I'd stay tuned for that it's also worth
mentioning French I'm performance
throughout most of the testing so far
I've only been discussing average frame
rates which don't illustrate how smooth
the experiences with the gaming box
smoothness can vary a lot with the
gaming box much more than a gaming
laptop or a gaming desktop due to the
inherent hardware limitations of ultra
portables like the slow CPU limited
memory capacity and bandwidth and so
forth some games run really smoothly for
the most part like Mass Effect Andromeda
Batman Arkham Knight and pray with only
the occasional slowdown other games like
The Witcher 3 stutter more frequently
often when the CPU is bouncing around
100 percent utilization these stutters
are not something I've experienced on
gaming laptops or desktops so it's
something to note about the external
graphics solutions in fact here's a
frame time graph so you can see exactly
what I'm talking about again it does
depend on the game but just be warned
that you may not get a smooth experience
in every game with an entry level
ultraportable I respect the experiences
a little bit better if you haven't have
a faster unit than my test system so
there's a lot to like about the Auris
gtx 1070 gaming box and then all stems
from the performance and price though
it's with an ultraportable other laptop
with that a dedicated graphics card will
see the gaming box transform their
system it is something genuinely capable
of playing modern games and it doesn't
just make games playable you'll be able
to run intensive titles a high to ultra
quality settings at either 1080p or even
1440p while maintaining respectable
frame rates the gaming box is extremely
simple to set up as well with
plug-and-play functionality making it
faster switch between a dock syrup for
gaming and a traditional ultra portable
for work on the go power delivery extra
USB ports and a very compact design are
great complementary features as well
though does have some RGB wiring and to
be honest it's it's a little bit
laughable in there the best aspect to
the gaming box though is its price at
$600 with an ink
your gtx 1070 it's a lot cheaper than
the razor core it even manages to
undercut some other external graphics
solutions by around a hundred dollars
making it a highly attractive option for
those looking to game on their existing
ultra portable there are some cases
where I wouldn't recommend the gaming
box if you're tossing up between this
solution and a gaming laptop the gaming
laptop will provide better performance
in most cases at a similar price to the
cost of an entry-level ultra portable
and the gaming box you won't get the
portability advantages by gaming laptops
are still a decent choice for some
buyers I also had a few concerns during
my testing which you should be aware of
like the tendency for the core i5 7200
new in my test laptop to cause a
bottleneck and some stuttering issues in
a handful of games external graphics is
still far from a perfect solution right
now and your experience may vary
depending on what laptop you hook it up
to in general though the Auris GTX 970
gaming box is the best external graphic
solution I've seen so far it should
definitely be on your radar if you want
to transform your Thunderbolt 3 equipped
laptop into a genuine gaming machine
anyway that's it for this look at the
origin 1070 gaming box really impressive
what it brings to the table if your
