discussing what I feel with the worst
CPU and GPU purchases of 2018 now some
of these products should have never
existed now somewhere just a bit
pointless and others made promises that
they didn't fulfill but before we get to
that a very quick ad from today's video
sponsor Corsair and the new hydro series
H 115 I RGB platinum all in one liquid
cooler this is course as best ever
liquid cooler both in terms of
performance and aesthetics the 280
millimeter radiator is cooled by 2 ml
Pro RGB 140 millimeter fans capable of
spinning and up to 2,000 rpm the cold
plate and pump design have been
optimized for greater performance while
the upgraded RGB lighting on the pump
head looks incredible and using the IQ
software can be synced up to match your
bill for more information please check
the link in the video description ok so
I'm not gonna mess around let's get
right into it with the worst GPU product
released this year possibly ever a back
in July we got our hands on the ddr4
version of the geforce GT 1030 and boy
oh boy what a heap of garbage that thing
was it's one thing to try and release a
really really crappy product and try to
flog it off but it's a completely
different thing to pull a
bait-and-switch on your customers in
video are basically committing fraud in
my opinion with the GT 1030 ddr4 and I'm
quite surprised more media outlets
didn't make a fuss about this one one
big youtuber even blamed the consumers
claiming that if you're dumb enough to
buy a brand-new entry-level graphics
card then well it serves you right
anyway for those of you who missed the
drama and video released to the GT 1030
back in May of 2017 and it was a pretty
weak entry-level offering but it was
good enough to play titles such as
rocket league fortnight and csgo for
example at a respectable resolution such
as 1080p basically if you're a parent
who isn't massively into computers and
you want to buy something cheap for a
little Billy to play fort now with these
buddies then a $70 GT 1030 will fit the
bill nicely the problem is as
of March 2018 little Billy could end up
with a GT 10 D that will average 66 fps
and fortnight or one that'll average
less than 40 fps and they have the same
name they look the same and they're the
same price what happened here was in
video quietly introduced a ddr4 version
in March that had 65% less bandwidth
than the original ddr5 model sixteen
point eight gigabytes per second of
bandwidth down from 48 gigabytes per
second so unless you knew what to look
out for you'd be none the wiser and even
tech-savvy users got caught out as they
didn't even know there were two models
so didn't bother to check the memory
type just assuming they're all gddr5 as
they had been for ten months after the
initial release oh and before moving on
there is something that I would like to
just make crystal clear this isn't on
invidious board partners they can't
create a graphics card that's out of
spec out of Nvidia spec I many argued
with us that this was on Galax as we
used a Galax ddr4 version of the GT 1030
for testing or it would be on anyone
else who made a ddr4 version of the GT
1030 but guys that's not how this
industry works in video calls all the
shots and if you don't comply with their
demands you get cut off and for most of
these AI bees that would be a death
sentence Nvidia created the ddr4 version
of the GT 1030 and they are pretty much
entirely responsible for screwing over
the poorest and often most vulnerable PC
gamers
from one disgusting anti-consumer act to
the next the good guys also play dirty
in 2018 now before getting into this one
I'll just say that I'm not interested in
arguing about which one was worse who
was more naughty in videos GT 1030 DDR
full version or AMD's rx 580 that's
really an Rx 570 I seriously don't have
time for fanboys defending either
company's actions especially when
they've done something this
anti-consumer and you honestly just
become as much of a problem when you
defender these dodgy products at least
in my opinion now I have no doubt that
in videos GT 1030 affected more people
and in my opinion it is a far worse
product but the radio rx 580 2048 SP is
still garbage
it's a rare anti-consumer move by AMD
and what we have to let them know that
we won't stand for it
basically what AMD did here was take the
RX 570 GPU and then rebrand it as an RX
580 2048 SP so they're basically calling
in irx 570 and rx 580 and well that's
just a flat-out lie at least AMD did
slightly change the name or at least
they added to it but still the prime
name very much suggests to buyers that
this is an RX 580 and might not be any
different to any other rx 580 maybe the
seller just added 2048 SP to make it
sound more fancy let's be honest how
many buyers even know what 2048 SP means
and how many of them know that the RX
580 is meant to have 2,304 SPS or stream
processors now you could argue these
models are only being sold in China but
I don't know why you would last I
checked Chinese consumers are still
people they work for their money and
ripping them off is no different to
ripping anyone else off also if you hop
on eBay and search for new RX 5 80s on
the first page you will be met with a
2048 SP model and around the same price
as the fully fledged 2,304 SP models
granted they are only being sold under
Chinese brands but it's still possible
to get your hands on one and sellers can
get away with calling them RX 5 80s if
they choose to and if caught out you
don't really have a leg to stand on so
we strongly feel that aim they need
to be called out on this one and
hopefully we won't see this kind of crap
again though I did say that after they
accidentally called an Rx 460 and rx 560
well maybe AMD can work they're naming
schemes out in 2019 fingers crossed
next up we have the Intel skylake X
refresh one of the biggest snooze fest
of 2018 earlier in the year at the
Computex trade show the Battle of the
cause was in full swing
but while Intel was well I think Tim put
it there in fantasy land with their 5
gigahertz 28 core a chiller type CPU
aimed he was actually showing off well
an actual real product that they
released I think it was just a month
later we still haven't received the 28
core monstrosity from Intel that
requires a completely different socket
and likely a motherboard that cost more
than an ITX graphics card so I guess we
have that to look forward to what we did
get was a range of new 9th gen high-end
desktop processors and apparently
they're so good Intel was able to skip
the 8th gen models the only problem is
they aren't that good and they don't
even deserve the 8th gen branding let
alone the 9th gen these are just the
same old 7th gen Scylla hex parts but
with a soldered Tim that actually
manages to make them worse at least for
extreme users you know the kind of users
that they're targeted at the core I
$9.99 ATX II for example the 1980 dollar
model yeah it's only $20 cheaper than
the 79 80 XE but I'll get to that in a
moment
the 99 80 XE runs so hot when I
overclocked it can't actually be
overclocked as far as a deal it in 79 80
XE and you can't delete the 99 ad XE
without destroying it so that means
enthusiastic buying the older 79 80 XE
and do what enthusiasts avoids done with
Intel CPUs at least for a few years now
and that is delayed them all that aside
the biggest issue is the pricing Intel
still in la-la land when it comes to
pricing or maybe it's the consumers as
Intel still seems to be moving what they
can make anyway anyone willing to
properly evaluate their options will
seriously
question why they would spend so much
more on ask I like X refresh CPU when
they have what are arguably better
options from AMD at much cheaper prices
right now the thread route for 2950 X
cost $900 us while the 1950s can be had
for an unbelievably low $600 us then on
the other side of the fence we have
Intel's 16 core a 32 thread 99 60 X and
that costs 16 hundred and $85 us so just
shall I have $1,700 us on that one
so in short Intel recycled their CPUs
and even their pricing from 2017 and it
has to be said back then they weren't
really competitive at least in my
opinion so the new skylake X refresh
parts really are pointless
and I'd say worse than that they're
actually a really bad Buy okay so I
suspect almost all of us certainly the
vast majority will agree that invidious
ddr4 stunts with the GT 1030 was bad
AMD's choice to release an Rx 570 under
the RX 580 branding should be frowned
upon and Intel skylake X refresh is
extremely disappointing and represents a
very poor value where I feel quite a few
of you will be divided is on this
nomination the nvidia geforce r-tx 2070
and 2080 some of the worst GPU purchases
of 2018 so let me try and clarify a few
things here at the MSRP switch a few
models are selling at the 2070 and 2080
aren't bad buys certainly not the most
exciting products to be released this
year but for the most part they're a
little faster than the outgoing pascal
parts and are now available at the same
price but even so two and a bit years
later that's not exactly progress but I
suppose with AMD nowhere to be seen it's
hard to bash Nvidia for giving us almost
nothing extra frankly though we could
take them or leave them not really
fussed one way or the other personally I
would have been just as happy if Nvidia
went on selling Pascal and a slightly
discounted price the problem I have with
these new r-tx GPUs is that initially
they sold for at least $100 us over the
MSRP and this made the r-tx 2070 for
example 20% more expensive than the
1080 at the time 10 80s were dropping in
price summers Louis $430 us so there
were some serious bargains to be had and
yet many people were actively avoiding
them as the newer r-tx models came with
the promise of phenomenal ray-traced
graphics and big performance gains with
dl SS problem is if you paid $600 us for
an RT x 2070 you were massively
overpaying for GT x 1080 light
performance this is because ray tracing
basically doesn't work on the RT x 2070
it's just nowhere near powerful enough
hell barely works on the 28 e TI then
you have DL SS which looks to be just as
useless at this point and yes I know
battlefield 5 performance has been
greatly improved since the initial
release but as Tim found it's been
achieved by downgrading the game's
graphics to enable those gains and
ray-tracing still has some serious
quality issues and let's not forget that
the game support list for ray tracing is
also extremely underwhelming in the case
of battlefield 5 given what we've seen
thus far I'd personally rather just
disable it enjoy a 50% performance boost
playing on an RT X 2070 at 1080p with an
average of about 60 fps just can't be
compared to playing at 1440p with over
80 fps
ray tracing just isn't worth that kind
of performance and resolution downgrade
of course ray tracing is an optional
feature you don't have to use it but
this was the key selling point of the
new RT X series and without it well you
basically just have a fat Pascal GPU not
exactly but sort of and yes we know that
ray tracing is the future of gaming but
having gamers pay a premium to pave the
way for a new feature they can't really
enjoy now isn't the best way to go about
getting it I'm sure it works for NVIDIA
though
so in short gamers chomping at the bit
for a new graphics card in 2018 or sold
a false reality with the Arctic's 2070
and unfortunately some paid a serious
premium you could certainly argue that
the RTS 2080 was even worse as it was
well overpriced very much longer period
of time and even today it generally
costs more than what you were paying for
a GTX 1080i prior to the 28 is release
so the 2080 is pretty bad value in that
sense but I have honed in on the RT X
2017 given the laughably poor support
for ray tracing and that was a
technology that was used to heavily
promote the product
and generate sales so 2018 has been a
bit of a frustrating year in the PC
hardware space though it has also been
quite exciting at some points so while
some early adopters have been a bit
burnt all those going after bragging
rights
they've been some great value options as
well AMD almost got away with a clean
rap sheet in 2018 and had they not
released the dodgy rx 580 2048 SP
graphics card the Chinese market I would
really have nothing bad to say about
them they're heavily discounted Rison
processes along with the RX 580 and 570
the real RX 580 and 570 they've been big
hits this year oh and there's also been
some insane for everybody's getting
about as well I'm sure some of you will
disagree with me calling the RT X 2070
and 2080 into question but I feel NVIDIA
has taken advantage of gamers with the
new RT x-series particularly the
2017-2018 which really offered nothing
over the two-year old Pascal parts
they're replacing I was a little tempted
to include the RT X 20 ATT I found his
Edition simply because of the alarmingly
high failure rate and for the way in
videos handled this situation but I'm
still on the fence about that one and
while we did have a 28 e card go all
space invaders on us and we get to have
an issue with a single RT X 20 atti
model granted our sample size has only
been a few cards but I think overall
your chances of getting a dud a pretty
low and it really has to be said that
the 20 ATT is just a beast it enables an
amazing 4k gaming experience one that
we've never seen before at least entails
that lack solid SLI support of course
there's also now the Titan RT X which is
probably the worst value GPU to be
released this year but we haven't seen
that one yet so we don't really know
what it's capable of that we have a
pretty good idea of what to expect but
anyway I'll hold off till we have some
solid data then we have Intel score I
$9.99 or K which is a terrible value CPU
but also a very powerful CPU so I'm a
bit torn on that one the 95 watt TDP
spec has caused problems and the
principal technology report was dirty
preorder tactic from Intel and we
certainly don't want to see that
repeated all that said the 1900 still a
beast and technically a better CPU than
the rise in seven 2700 x again world's
worse in terms of value but technically
a better processor
that being the case it's not one of the
worst CPUs released in 2018 if it was
only as fast as the 2700 X or slower
than Shah it certainly would have made
this list what probably should have made
this list were a number of the Z 390
motherboards in particular the budget
models we thought the entire point of
the Zed 390 chipset was to signify the
boards using it when 99 or okay ready
and optimized for the eight core CPU in
other words they had a capable vrm with
adequate cooling with the exception of
gigabytes lineup this wasn't the case
and all other brands just rehashed their
entry levels and 370 boards and improved
margins we saw a horrible vrm throttling
on all budget boards from MSI asrock and
a soos
rendering them pretty much useless for
the eight core processor anyway that is
going to do it for this one if you liked
the video well you know what to do if
you dislike the video because you bought
an Intel AMD or video product this year
then you also know what to do and of
course if your opinions differ from mine
