tap the bell welcome back to hardware on
box so a couple of months ago viewsonic
reached out and said they had a brand
new ultrawide monitor that I might be
interested in checking out as a big fan
of the 21:9 format for gaming I jumped
on board with this opportunity because
this monitor in question isn't a
standard ultra wide rather than using a
2560 by 1080 or 34 40 by 1440 resolution
the VP 38 81 packs a higher 38 40 by
1600 resolution which is something I
haven't used before
now the 38 inch VP 38 81 isn't really
designed for gaming it's a professional
monitor with features like X right
calibration yes
calibration for accurate srgb
reproduction but I was interested to see
whether the largest size and higher
resolution have a notable impact on
gaming especially coming from the ACE of
primer x34 that I use personally is this
the next step for gaming ultra wines or
is there not much point when we already
have 34 40 by 1440 there's actually a
surprising number of advantages to the
38 inch 38 40 by 1600 panel compared to
the slightly smaller lower resolution
ultra wise that are commonly used today
while we are only talking about a few
extra inches added to the diagonal
dimension relative to more common 34 and
35 inch ultra lights the overall display
area is a significant 21 percent larger
thanks to an additional 8 centimeters of
width and a bit over 3 centimeters of
height when viewed from the same
distance as a 34 inch monitor it's more
immersive and has quite a noticeable
impact even if some of those dimension
changes don't sound that large the great
thing about this particular 38 inch
panel is the radius of the curve modern
ultra wines typically use an 1800 or
1900 R curve which in my opinion is a
bit too aggressive
while the original ace x 34 used a
rather flat 3800 R curve the VP 38 81
sits in between at 2300 R which is that
little
flatter than most modern gaming old
wives and I think it works really well
it's not as obviously curved and that
makes it better to use for productivity
apps when you're not gaming while the
panel is larger and slightly less curved
it does maintain the same pixel density
as 34 inch 34 40 by 1440 panels the
higher 38 40 by 1600 resolution
basically matches the increase in
display size now posting 110 point 9
paper versus 109 point 6 on the other
older ultra wide panel types you
actually get nearly 1.2 million more
pixels here for a 24 percent increase
and of course there is going to be a
performance hit associated with that in
fact let's take a look at how the higher
resolution impacts performance this is
going to be a fairly basic comparison
between 34 40 by 1440 and 38 and 40 by
1600 resolutions on my personal rig
which is currently equipped with the
Rison seven 1700 exit 3.9 gigahertz 16
gig of ddr4 3000 and an NVIDIA Titan X
Pascal however it should give you a good
idea of how this higher resolution
compared to the current high-end ultra
wide standard in 8 games all the games I
tested here is set to their maximum
quality presets or ultra presets using
DirectX 11 playing games at 34 40 by
1440 with ultra details is already a bit
of a challenge with a Titan X or GTX
1080 Ti class graphics card especially
if you're targeting above 60fps in GTA 5
we're seeing 1% lows around the 50 FPS
mark at 34 40 wide and that drops closer
to 40 FPS at 38 to 41 so a 17% reduction
in rise of the Tomb Raider the
performance choppers have been higher at
21% though when as we aren't achieving
30 fps 1% lows you'd probably turn down
the quality settings anyway then in
watchdogs 2 we're looking at a modest
14% drop in 1% lows which keeps the game
pretty playable while in prey it's a
significant drop from around 70 FPS to
just 59 FPS in 1% lows you get a similar
performance drop of around 16 to 17
percent in both Star Wars Battlefront 2
and battlefield 1 they're both games
still run above 60fps and are quite easy
to play on such a high resolution
provided you have a decent graphics card
in
for we're seeing about a 21% drop in
performance looking at the 1% low
results while in Far Cry 5 the drop is a
more manageable 12% overall when looking
at average frame rates the move from
thirty four forty by fourteen forty two
thirty eight forty by sixteen hundred
sees the performer shop of around
eighteen percent on average which is in
line with the resolution change
similarly when looking at one percent
lows the shift to a higher resolution
brings about a seventeen percent
performance drop so this new thirty
eight forty by sixteen hundred panel is
larger and more immersive which is great
for gaming though it does come at a
performance in I do like the extra size
but is it really worth a minor upgrades
over thirty four forty by 1440 at thirty
four inches when you get that
performance it as well for some people
the exercise will make no difference and
all you're left with is reduced
performance for others the exercise
might be great and then you might be
fine with the performance in bit of a
personal preference thing here and I
think it does come down to your system
as well my personal rig has a Titan X in
it so I'm somewhere okay with the
performance hit and I like an extra size
others gaming on more like a gtx 1070 on
high res ultra wise probably won't want
fewer frames the other issue with these
pedals at the moment is refresh rate the
vp 38 81 is capped at 60 hertz which
makes sense as it is a professional
modeler where you know additional frame
rate isn't as important as with gaming
modernists currently though we have 34
40 by 1440 panels that go as high as 120
Hertz and there are similar monitors
scheduled for release later this year
that push that up to 200 Hertz if we
start to see 38 40 by 1600 pushing to
the gaming market 60 Hertz really isn't
going to cut it so we need at least a
hundred Hertz here for these sorts of
panels to be attractive to gamers
luckily there are some big benefits to
using a thirty eight forty by sixteen
hundred mile outside of gaming as the
pixel density remains around that 110
PPI mark you can still use these sorts
of panels in desktop apps at the native
resolution without needing to mess
around with display scaling it maintains
a 1440p class density it just gives you
more screen real estate to work with and
the extra screen real estate is
genuinely useful one of the big
improvements is snapping apps in a
side-by-side view on the 34 40 by 1440
mano this
by side view gives you to 1720 by 1440
windows which I have felt isn't quite
enough horizontal distance a lot of
interfaces are designed with 1920 wide
in mind
well the 3840 by 1600 VP 38 81 gives you
2 1920 by 1600 windows which achieves
that nice compatible 1920 wide
resolution while still providing a ton
of vertical space to work with again it
may seem like a minor change but in some
apps it does make a big difference to
usability just as an aside to if you're
interested in this view sonic VP 38 81
is a professional-grade model it really
is excellent fantastic color
reproduction with certified average
Delta values below 2.0 for industry
standards like srgb and rec 709 and it's
one of the most uniform curved displays
I've looked at plus it supports USB C
connectivity that can charge a connected
device and provide display output over a
single cable
anyway the stylus video I wanted whether
3840 by 1600 ultra wide would be the
next step for gaming motors having now
used one I think there's a lot of great
qualities to this type of panel that
makes it a decent all-rounder for gaming
and desktop apps it doesn't provide
anything significantly better than more
commonly found 34 40 by 1440 displays
but it is a bit better in some key areas
and that's the real selling point here
however I do think that to make these
sorts of panels work well for gaming
they will need to push up to higher
refresh rates as 60 Hertz is a bit
last-gen these days whether or not it's
possible or whether companies are even
working on higher refresh panels of this
resolution remains to be seen and of
course you'll have to put up with around
a 17 percent performance here to enjoy
the extra size and pixel count anyway
that's it for this brief look at 3840 by
1600 gaming thanks to viewsonic for
sending out a vp 38 81 for some testing
it's always appreciated if you liked
this video give it a thumbs up and
support us on patreon if you feel like
it there's some cool stuff over there
and as always I'll catch you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
