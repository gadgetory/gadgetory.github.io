benchmarks nvidia did something
unexpected and released all the details
regarding the upcoming 1070 or at least
the details we weren't yet privy to such
as the core configuration sadly I don't
have a card yet right now I have no idea
when i'll be getting my hands on one but
i'm sure another extreme benchmark
session won't be far away so 12 the 1070
specifications as expected this upcoming
graphics card features a cut-down gp100
for GPU featuring 1920 cuda cores down
from 2560 on the GTX 1080 along with 120
TM use and 64 arrow keys Bruce clock
speeds have also been decreased down to
1600 megahertz from 1733 megahertz the
memory system says 8 gigabytes a
standard gddr5 connected through the
same 256-bit bus the royal memory
frequency is 2,000 megahertz resulting
in a gigabits per second transfer speed
for memory bandwidth of 256 gigabytes
per second this is actually still very
fast as the GTX 980 features a similar
memory subsystem with a slightly slower
clocked memory resulting in thirteen
percent less memory bandwidth because
the GTX 1070 is essentially just a cut
down version of the 1080 it features the
same physical die meeting is still
measured 314 millimeters squared and
comprises of 7.2 billion transistors
however because there are less enabled
cuda cores the TDP has been lowered to
150 watts which is seventeen percent
lower than the 1080 now for the good
stuff nvidia claims the 1070 will
slightly outperform the geforce gtx
titan x this is important as the gtx
1070 will become available in june the
tenth for four hundred and fifty dollars
as a founders edition card with board
partners set to release customized
designs at a lower MSRP of three hundred
and eighty dollars a few weeks later
this is pretty bloody awesome because in
video is suggesting $1,000 GPU
performance or at least six hundred
fifty dollars if you look at the more
realistic 980 TI Brazil is 380 dollars
in a few weeks time it actually isn't
very hard to accurately determine the
GTX 10 70s performance now that we have
the 1080 results and more crucially know
the exact specs of the 1070 there are
just twenty five percent less cause
tiemuzhen ROP
along with a six percent reduction
operating frequency just three percent
if you compare the boost clocks
therefore you can safely assume that the
gtx 1070 will be at the most around
twenty-five to thirty percent slower
than the 1080 one would think it's
almost impossible for it to be much
slower than that realistically i'd guess
the average margin across that 21-game
sample will end up being around twenty
percent however I've got to reiterate
that I'm just guessing here given we
found on average that GT X 1080 was
twenty-three percent faster than the
type next I feel it's gonna be very
likely the Titan next and 1070 will
trade blows I don't think one will be
outright faster than the other
interestingly if we deduct twenty
percent from the 1080s result in Far Cry
primal again that was in line with the
21 game average we see that the 1070
matches the titan axon gtx 980 TI
exactly again I can't stress enough this
is a made-up result by me so the real
result could be different it's an
educated guess to show you guys where I
think the 1070 will land I really hope
this is where the 1070 lend up there's
that kind of performance will make the
board partner cards are really good by
three hundred and eighty dollars if the
overclocking Headroom is as good as I'm
expecting I mean the 1070 might be able
to achieve 1080 like performance it
would have been nice to see the same
three hundred and thirty dollar MSRP
that accompanied the GTX 970 but if it
all goes well that extra fifty dollars
shouldn't be too hard to justify well
that's enough speculation from me I hope
this was interesting for all you guys
asked you for my take on the ten
seventies performance if you've got any
questions or perhaps the sample card you
want to send me let me know in the
comments let me host matters always and
I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
