big benchmark video for the r-tx 20 60
mm okay there's a bit of a problem you
know I think few people will think you
should have compared the rx 517 with the
three give you like gtx 1060 rather than
the 1050 TI but the RX 570 is usually
cheaper though at 7:52 other moment yeah
yeah yeah I know but people are arguing
that the 1063 gigabyte isn't that much
more expensive it's faster so you
cherry-pick the comparison to make a em
deal with better alright alright s to
include the three gigabyte 1060 with the
rx 570 and the GTX 1050 jay-ar yeah good
idea
and just to cover your bases because you
know these tests only take like 5
minutes how about you also include the 6
gigabyte 1060 and a gigabyte rx 580
welcome back to however unboxed it is
time to reevaluate the value of the
radiant Erik's 570 all over again
because apparently I didn't do it right
the first time I think a lot of people
were caught out by the fact that the RX
570 is indeed cheaper than the GTX 1050
I right now I'll admit it's quite
surprising given that the 570 walks all
over the 1050 Ti but that is the current
situation and really I should have made
this comparison sooner back when pricing
dropped back down to earth during the
mining crisis where gamers couldn't
really get their hands on any kind of
radeon GPU we turned to the 3 gigabyte
gtx 1060 as its limited memory buffer
made it pretty much useless for any and
all mining operations
this meant pricing held pretty steady as
a result it was the best value mid-range
option for quite some time today though
the 3 gigabyte gtx 1060 is commonly
found at or around the $200 u.s. MSRP at
the time of making this video the
cheapest card on you egg was priced at
exactly $200 u.s. and there were five
options available at that price the RX
570 on the other hand there
three models priced at 150 dollars us
with multiple options available for the
170 dollar US MSRP meanwhile the GTX
1050 TI which recently got destroyed and
ahead take comparison with the 570 costs
170 dollars u.s. though there is a model
on sale for a hundred and fifty-five
dollars but it's a very ordinary model
with a pretty rubbish cooler another
standout option right now and perhaps
the only real competition for the rx 570
is the rx 580 there's an 8 gigabyte
power color model selling for just $180
us right now with a few models priced at
between 200 and 210 dollars u.s.
meanwhile the fully fledged 6 gigabyte
1060 s typically cost around 240 to 250
dollars u.s. anyway today we'll be
comparing all of these GPUs in a 36 game
battle at 1080p and 1440p to see how
they compare in terms of performance and
then of course cost per frame as was the
case last time we only going to discuss
the results for a dozen of the games and
then jump into our performance breakdown
as usual our corsair GPU test rig built
inside the crystal series 570 x has been
used and inside we have a core i 9 1900
k clocked at 5 gigahertz with 32
gigabytes of ddr4 3,200 memory as for
the drivers were again using adrenalin
2019 Edition nineteen point one point
one for the Radeon GPUs and then the
game ready for 1735 WH QL drivers for
the GeForce GPUs okay so with all that
out of the way let's get into the
results like last time I'll be keeping
the order of the graphics cards static
so they won't be ordered from slowest to
fastest I've also kept the red shadow
for the Radeon GPUs and then the green
shadow for the NVIDIA GPUs so starting
with shut off the Tomb Raider we see at
the RX 570 is able to edge out the GTX
1063 gigabyte here though the margin is
very small
meanwhile the RX 580 is a good bit
faster than the 60 gigabyte 1060
providing 9% more frames at 1080p
next up we have strange Brigade and this
is an amazingly well optimised game and
although it is an AMD sponsored title it
still works very well with NVIDIA
Hardware here the RX 570 outpaced the
three gigabyte GTX 1060 as well as the
six key byte model and then we have the
gtx 1050
ETI trailing by a country mile the RX
570 was just 6% slower than the RX 5 AE
so a pretty good result there
battlefield 5 is another game where
these affordable radio and GPS take up
very well to the competition the RX 580
for example blitz the six gigabyte 1060
while the RX 570 just manage to outpace
the three gigabyte 1060 at 1080p but did
beat it quite comfortably at 1440p
basically the 570 was on par with the
six gigabyte 1060 in this title Sniper
Elite 4 is another game where the Radeon
GPUs do very well here the RX 570 match
the 1% low performance of the 3G about
1060 while beating it for the average
frame rate quite convincingly at 1080p I
might add the RX 580 also beat the 6
gigabyte 1060 by convincing margin and
it was also 18% faster than the 570 at
turn EP I haven't said much about the
gtx 1050 TI for the last few games and
while probably not too much that needs
to be said here performance in monster
hunter world is extremely competitive
between the RX 575 80 and 1060 models
the three gigabyte 1060 just edged out
the RX 570 while the RX 580 just beat
the six gigabyte 1060 so bang for your
buck the 570 stacks up very well
moving on to warframe and we see at
terapy that the AMD GPUs enjoy slightly
better frame time performance though the
1060 s did provide the best average
frame rates frame time performance did
improved for the GeForce GPUs at 1440p
and here the 3d about 1060 beats the RX
570 by a pretty comfortable margin the
just cause for performance was also
quite competitive here the rx 517 GTX
1063 gigabyte were basically
neck-and-neck while the RX 580 was 7%
faster than the 6 gigabyte 1060 when
looking at the average frame rate grand
theft auto 5 provided the rx 570 with
its smallest win over the GTX 1050 TI in
our previous video so it's no surprise
to find the GTX 1060 pulling ahead here
basically even the three gigabyte
version was able to beat the rx 580
though the frame time performance was
much the same
this meant the six year by 1060 was
hands down the fastest GPU tested in
this title assassin's creed Odyssey is
another title that doesn't work
well with AMD Hardware despite the fact
that it is an AMD sponsored title the rx
580 gets trounced by the six gigabyte
1060 though having said that the three
gigabyte 1060 does struggle with some
pretty ugly frame time results at 1440p
and even 1080p moving on to the hitman
results here we find quite competitive
performance the three gigabyte 1060 did
edged ahead of the RX v 7t at 1080p
though it also fell behind at 1440p the
RX 580 on the other hand was able to
beat this six figure by 1060 at 1080p
and it did so quite comfortably at 1440p
the Radeon GPUs have always done very
well in Rainbow six siege and here we
see the rx 580 pretty well thrashing the
60 gigabyte GTX 1060 though the three
gigabyte model stacks up pretty well
against the rx 570 now I should note
that the ultra quality priests that I
test with uses a render scale of 50 not
50% just 50 and what this means is 1920
by 1080 becomes 13 60 by 764 the game
uses temporal upscaling so you end up
with an image that's rescaled to the
output resolution anyway I used to test
with these settings as this is the
default option for the ultra quality
preset but quite a few Rainbow six siege
players complain that our frame rates
were too high not realizing that they
had manually configured these options
the maximum in-game preset actually sets
the render scale about 30% lower than
the output resolution anyway to keep the
Rainbow six players happy I now select
the ultra preset then manually adjust
the render scale to 100 each and every
time this makes the game an extreme vram
user at turn AP the game calls for at
least six and a half gigabytes of memory
and this is the reason why the three
gigabyte 1060 and even the 4 gigabyte RX
570 get hit pretty hard here it's not
often that the 8 gigabyte rx5 Hattie
offers over 40% more performance than
the 4 gigabyte rx 570 at 1080p I didn't
check these numbers quite a few times
but that is the situation here when
using those settings in the end the RX
580 beats the 6 q by 1060 while the 3
gigabyte 1016 RX 570 are comparable
across the two tested resolutions the
last game we're going to discuss the
results for is
World of Tanks and here all GPUs
performed very well at 1080p that said
the GTX 1060 three and six cubic models
were able to quite easily beat the
Radeon competition particularly at 1080p
the three gigabyte 1060 for example was
22% faster than the rx 570 and this
margin was reduced to just 16 percent at
1440p so still a pretty solid win here
for Nvidia still as I said overall the
performance was still very good using
either the Radeon or GTX 1060 series
GPUs okay so previously we found the
Radeon rx 570 to be on average of 43
percent faster than geforce gtx 1050 TI
when calculating the averages on a per
game basis and then obviously averaging
those figures by the number of games
tested but since I'm not comparing two
GPUs head-to-head but rather five GPUs
I won't calculate the same way at least
not for this initial look at performance
I'll show those the game breakdown stuff
a little later on so I'm for now I'm
just simply going to take the FPS data
from all the games than average those
figures and this sees the RX 570 come
out on top by a 41% margin so there's a
one to two percent margin of error there
depending on which way we work the data
out just just a bit of a rounding error
the three gigabyte gtx 1060 was on
average four percent faster than the RX
570 across the 36 games tested and
giving it a 3 FPS advantage on average
then we see a further 14 percent jump in
performance the RX 580 a 'king about gtx
1066 gigabyte both of which averaged 82
FPS across the 36 game sample this made
the 8 gigabyte rx 580 on average 19%
faster than the 4G by rx 570 and this
makes sense given that the RX 5 ad packs
13% more cores with an 8% core clock
speed advantage and on top of that we
saw a few instances where having twice
the vram was also advantageous before
moving on here's a quick breakdown of
how the RX 570 compares to the other
GPUs tested on a per game basis in the
last video we saw how it dominated the
gtx 1050 TI across all 36 games and as I
said earlier when calculating the
percentage difference per game we end up
with a 43% performance advantage in
favor of the
our X 570 due to a rounding error
compared to the GTX 1063 gigabyte the RX
570 was just 4% slower on average and
here you can clearly see where the radio
and GPU got the better of the three
gigabyte 1060 and then of course where
the GeForce GPU came out on top the RX
570 enjoyed big wins in Forza horizon 4
and hitman wild lost by a convincing
margin in Total War saga GTA 5 and
fortnight as you might expect the
performance deficit is extended we
compared to the 60 gigabyte GTX 1060
here the RX 570 was 14% slower on
average and its only real win came in
strange Brigade then finally we have a
comparison with the rx 580 and here the
570 was 14% slower on average and was
for the most part between 10 and 16
percent slower right so that's how they
stack up and cross a wide range of games
and those are certainly in the margins
you can typically expect a seed the only
question left to address now is how they
stack up in terms of value and I'll
answer that one we will be checking out
some cost per frame figures please note
the prices quoted here are in US Dollars
and they were taken from Newegg I
ignored the absolute lowest price if
there was just a single model available
and I believe this is an accurate and
fair representation of the current
market prices so at a current retail
price of a hundred and fifty dollars the
RX 570 costs just 2 dollars and 17 cents
per frame but even if we use the hundred
and seventy dollar MSRP it still only
comes out to two dollars and 46 cents
per frame making it 11 percent cheaper
than the three gigabyte gtx 1060 the RX
580 is also exceptional value at the
current $190 us asking price it's just 6
percent more costly per frame than the
rx 570 and an impressive 21% cheaper
than the 6 gigabyte gtx 1060 then at the
bottom of the graph we see just how bad
the gtx 1050 is at the current asking
price at 170 dollars it works out to be
almost 60% more costly per frame than
the RX 570 just quickly before wrapping
up the cost per frame stuff here is a
look at prices down under I realize only
about 4% of those watching this video
are fellow Australians but looking at
how the margins compare
different region might interest more
than just the Aussies interestingly here
in Australia the RX 570 is even better
value at least relative to the
competition that said there are only
three retailers selling models for $200
and the rest seem to be more like two
hundred and fifty dollars but even so at
that price the 570 still only cost three
dollars and 62 cents per frame making it
ten percent cheaper than the rx 580 and
three gigabyte gtx 1060 on that note
with a three gigabyte 1060 and eight
gigabyte RX 580 offering the same cost
per frame you'd surely be better off
spending $40 more on the radio and GPU
for the simple fact that it comes with
more than twice as much vram so taking
all that into account we find that once
again if you're looking at spending well
under $200 us on a graphics card it is
hard to go past those 150 dollar RX 5
70s and even here in Australia there are
some serious rx 570 bargains to be had
unless in video starts offering
retailers discounts and there really
isn't much point buying a GeForce
graphics card if you have less than $300
u.s. to spend at this point in time I
really recommend avoiding the three
gigabyte 1060 the extremely limited via
RAM buffer is already proving to be a
bit of a problem and you can expect it
to become even more a problem as we move
forward upcoming titles in 2019 are
probably going to give it a bit of a
hard time even at 1080p and we see even
four gigabytes really is right on the
edge for budget graphics cards and for
this reason I'd recommend snapping up an
aching about rx 580 if you can stretch
the budget anyway that is going to do it
for this one next I promise I will have
a 36 game GeForce RTX 2060 benchmark and
have to say that one's looking a bit
more impressive than I was expecting
so anyway keep an eye out for that video
it won't be too long before it's on the
