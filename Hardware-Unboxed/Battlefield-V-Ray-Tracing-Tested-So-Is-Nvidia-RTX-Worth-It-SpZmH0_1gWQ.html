real-time rect racing is finally here
and today we're exploring how the effect
looks and performs in the first game to
support it fully battlefield 5 in this
video we've not only benchmarked the
three NVIDIA GeForce RT X cards across
all the rate racing presets in the game
but we've also got some great
comparisons for you to show exactly the
difference between RT x on and RT X off
in the real world we've already touched
on battlefield 5s regular performance
across a range of GPUs in a video
earlier this week and we found that it
runs pretty well on ultra settings with
a range of graphics cards invidious new
r-tx cards do particularly well with
something like the RT x 2070 being able
to play it above 120 fps at 1080p or
well above 80 FPS at 1440p and naturally
the RT x 2080 Ti is an absolute beast at
both these resolutions with frame rates
above 140 fps but we now have rate
racing in battlefield 5 and since the
announcement of RT X features back in
August the big question has been how the
game would perform once this stressful
effect is enabled NVIDIA has been very
careful not to show any official
performance figures for the effects
running on even their flagship RT X 20
atti but we've seen plenty of reports
from those that have tried an early demo
version suggesting we're looking at a
1080p 60fps experience at best so how is
ray-tracing integrated into battlefield
5 well it's all pretty straightforward
all you need to do is download the
windows 10 October 2018 update version
18:09 to support microsoft's directx ray
tracing technology or DX up this update
was famously delayed for more than five
weeks due to bugs but microsoft resumed
the rollout a little over 24 hours ago
so you can now force download it using
Microsoft's Windows 10 update tool if it
isn't already in Windows Update for you
you also need to update battlefield 5 to
the latest version 2 through a hefty 16
gigabyte patch and you'll need the
latest GeForce 4 1694 drivers from
Nvidia after all that you simply load
the game enable DirectX 12 then enable
direct X ray tracing reflections
from there you'll have access to four
preset options 4dx are the standard
ultra high medium and low settings in
the game if you just use the presets
rather than custom settings the DXi mode
corresponding to your preset will be
selected you'll also see here that dice
isn't using game works to integrate
ray-tracing instead of sticking to a
basic cross vendor DirectX ray-tracing
implementation
RTX which is invidious ray tracing
technology platform sits below DXi in
the stack and is the tech that
essentially translates DirectX ray
tracing requests from the game into the
staff the GPU can actually work with so
how does the X are actually a look in
battlefield 5 well here's a direct
comparison of all four presets and the
first thing you should notice if there
is a large visual difference between
ultra and low but there's not much of a
difference between ultra high and medium
in fact there is basically no difference
between those settings for DX our
reflections and it's not just in this
scene I tested several other sections of
the game and couldn't spot any
difference between the highest three
settings this leads me to conclude that
there are only really two DXR modes in
the game ultra which applies the full
complement of ray tracing reflections in
the game and a cut-down lo mode for
better performance both the low and
ultra modes apply reflections to
surfaces like water puddles and shiny
objects but it's only the ultra mode
that also applies these reflections to
more matte surfaces like mud and your
gun your spot in this scene for example
that the ultra mode reflects the fiery
vehicle wreck of the muddy surface in
the front as well as on the barrel of
your weapon at some distance away switch
down to low and the reflection is
disappear on your gun and from the mud
leaving just reflections from the
water's surface from what we can tell
this is the main difference between the
two modes the quality of reflections in
terms of resolution accuracy and draw
distance is unaffected between the
presets so you get the same sort of
experience looking at those shiny
surfaces whether you're playing on ultra
or low switching it down a notch only
affects the amount of materials and
surfaces that are TX reflections apply
to ultra in my opinion gives a far
better and more realistic presentation
and really shows off the quality of ray
tracing while
it's still pretty good but it's not
quite at the same level one of the main
questions is how does rate racing
compared to the games standard
reflection mode screen space reflections
well undoubtedly
DXR provides a more realistic
presentation with far greater reflection
accuracy and resolution and of course
the ability to reflect objects that
aren't necessarily in your field of view
screen space reflections are only able
to reflect objects present on the screen
so things outside the field of view are
crudely cut off in an unnatural way
depending on the angle of reflection
you'll notice in the DXR off footage
that anything passing over the reflected
area like the falling leaf particles or
other people causes artifacting in the
reflected area and looks pretty ugly but
before you wonder this is the same issue
that was present in battlefield 1 so
it's not like diocese specifically
downgraded reflections in battlefield 5
only to upgrade them again with raytrace
naturally these issues aren't present
with ray tracing you get nice accurate
reflections in real time but there are
some issues with DXi as well
in this scene with a large puddle DXR
seems to be reflecting Gadre type
lighting effects that don't actually
exist in the non reflected world one of
these effects also is bizarrely cut off
which you can see here then in the
footage showing reflections on the
surface of your gun reflection quality
is quite low with almost a video encoded
blockiness to the effect even at 4k
reflection resolution of water doesn't
seem to be impacted nearly as much by
this low resolution effect in fact I say
the quality of those reflections is very
good it's also worth pointing out that
Ray traced reflections is the only ray
traced effect in battlefield 5 every
other aspect of how the game is rendered
is done through traditional means so
shadows and ambient occlusion for
example are the standard game effects
this means that if you're not in an area
with reflective surfaces you basically
aren't getting any benefit from DX R so
let's talk performance and here's where
it all falls apart for ray tracing
because performance is absolutely
horrendous even if you have Nvidia's
flagship RT X 20 80 TI and just wait
until I show you the results from the RT
X 2070 because it's well I guess you'll
see in a moment for this testing we used
all three of invidious RT X cards
running
a core i7 8700 K test rig and we tested
at both 1080p and 1440p for reasons that
will become quickly apparent we didn't
bother testing at 4k all other settings
were set to ultra and we only tested
with the ultra and lo DX our settings as
well as DXR off there was no performance
difference between ultra high and medium
for DX our reflections our test run was
doing an intensive part of the
single-player campaign with lots of
reflective areas we also did some spot
tests in multiplayer but it's hard to
get consistent accurate results only
testing in the multiplayer part of the
game in any case we didn't see any
significant performance differences
between single-player and multiplayer in
similar environments so here's the
results with the r-tx 20 80 TI and boy
oh boy it's not looking pretty at 1080p
the game comfortably runs at 150 FPS
with DXi disables but as soon as you
crank the DXi mode up to ultra
performance absolutely tanks dropping to
below 50 fps in other words performance
is immediately cut to one third of its
previous level switching down to the low
mode does improve things somewhat
although we're still facing half the
framerate we once had and even with an
RT X 20 atti
it's only at low DX our settings at
1080p that we're looking at average
frame rates above 60 fps then at 1440p
it's nightmare territory using the ultra
DX our mode performance is roughly
one-quarter of what it was with DX our
off while the frame rate was more than
halved using the low mode neither
setting can deliver 60 FPS with an RT X
20 atti
the game is smooth and very enjoyable
with DX I'll off that 1440p with this
flagship GPU but with DX r on it's not a
pretty situation then looking at the RT
x 2080 we're only just creeping above 60
FPS on average at 1080p with the low DX
our mode again performance is cut down
to one third of what it was when using
the ultra mode which in this case
delivers around 40 FPS which isn't
acceptable for a first-person shooter
like this even in single player and that
1440p how does a 47 FPS average sound
using the low DX our mode could
more than a hundred FPS with dioxide
disabled and with the RT X 2070
performance is absolutely evils half a
ball if I'm honest the ultra mode
delivers 30 FPS at 1080p down from a
hundred and ten FPS with DXi disabled
and with the low mode we're unable to
hit a 60 FPS average the game is
completely unplayable at 1440p as well
with DX are on an RT x 2070 in our
opinion it's interesting to note across
these tests that we are being RT called
limited here the higher the resolution
the higher the performance hit using the
ultra d XR mode to the point where
playing at 4k is more than four times
faster with DX our off this also plays
out when we spot-checked power
consumption the cars were running at
consistently lower power with DX are on
because the regular cuda cores are being
underutilized as such a low framerate
again though the degree to which
performance is reduced does depend on
how many reflective surfaces are in the
environment wet muddy areas are the most
heavily impacted playing in the city
area of Rotterdam in multiplayer mostly
had shiny reflective surfaces so the
performance hit wasn't as bad as in our
benchmark runs but we're still facing
less than half the framerate with the
ultra mode and then snowy areas seen the
least affected with relatively good
performance namely above 80 FPS at 1080p
with DX our on and a 20 atti involved if
you can count that as good but no matter
the environment if there are no
appropriately reflective surfaces
performance will be much better though
it still won't really come close to
reaching the level of playing with DX
are disabled at the same time if there
are no reflective surfaces visual
quality is largely identical to playing
with DX I'd disabled so you really want
a camp near water and shiny surfaces to
get that sweet ray-tracing goodness some
when it comes down to it DirectX ray
tracing and r-tx has basically played
out exactly as expected in the public
launch of the technology in battlefield
5 it was looking like performance would
be terrible and well it is terrible just
judging based on the demo footage
compared to performance you can get
today and it doesn't look like there
have been many significant steps towards
getting rate racing running at a higher
framerate it's just extremely
computationally intensive now real time
rate racing is a
graphical achievement is something that
has previously been impossible with
single GPS and will likely be the future
of the graphics industry but right now
there is basically no reason to enable
ray-tracing in battlefield 5 because the
performance hit is so severe it impacts
the experience massively we're in a
situation where the r-tx 2080 Ti is only
somewhat playable with DXR enabled at
1080p while 1440p is borderline and 4k
is out of the question
then with the RT X 2080 you might be
able to scrape by with the low mode at
1080p and in our opinion the RT X 2070
is not suitable for rate racing at all
and that's just looking at DX our
performance on its own the game runs at
excellent frame rates with these cards
with DXi disables we're talking well
above 100 FPS on all three cards at
1080p 1440p is also very playable at
high frame rates on even the RT x 2070
and you can even enjoy 4k gameplay
particularly on the 2080 ti I just don't
see why any gamer will choose to cut
their frame rate at least in half
sometimes up to a quarter to get rate
racing in a game where framerate has a
significant impact on competitiveness
and the overall experience you want to
be running this game at 130 fps with the
still visually excellent ultra settings
not 40 FPS with slightly better
reflections on top of that the quality
improvement from DX our reflections is
nice but you'll be hard-pressed to spot
the difference in fast paced motion
screen space reflections while not
perfect if you stare at a puddle for
hours do a decent job of approximating
reflections at a respectable performance
cost and when you're more focused on
running around and shooting enemies I'd
say it's almost impossible to tell the
difference between SSR and DX our
reflections and it goes beyond just the
raw performance and comparisons in
battlefield 5 real-time ray tracing was
meant to be the key selling point to the
GeForce r-tx cards in video is basically
using this technology as a way to
justify the higher price of these cards
compared to their GTX predecessors it
was meant to be a game-changing feature
I guess something that would
revolutionize your gaming experience
with crazy levels of visual quality but
the reality is at least with battlefield
5 the quality improvement doesn't
anywhere close to justify the insane
performance drop your experience with
DXi enables r-tx in this game simply
isn't a reason to buy the r-tx cards it
doesn't justify the price premium you're
paying for RTX features because honestly
i can't see any gamer playing with DXR
enabled for more than a few minutes when
you buy an RT x 2080 TI you want to be
playing the game at more than 120 FPS at
1440p with ultra settings you don't want
to cut that down to below 60 FPS so
reflections can be slightly more
accurate you spent $1,200 on the card
after all you should be getting well
over 60 FPS at 4k let alone 1080p for
real-time ray tracing to become the
future of graphics technology we need
more computing power specifically we
need more RT cores in invidious GPU
architecture because this 68 core is
provided with the RT X xx atti
allowing for 10 gig rates per second
well it isn't cutting it this may be a
stepping stone to getting read tracing
supporters in games and to show the
technology off to the world but
consumers really shouldn't be paying a
premium right now to run what
essentially amounts to a tech demo on
their PCs and honestly in the video
should have been far clearer about what
to expect from ray tracing when they
announce their new GPUs it's all well
and good to announce real-time ray
tracing as a major new feature but
buyers are going to be disappointed when
they purchase a $1200 product for
real-time ray tracing only to find out
using that feature results in awful
performance if ray tracing was presented
as more of a look into the future rather
than a feature ready for primetime in
today's games it would be much easier to
swallow what is being dished up in this
initial release the RT X 2070 deserves a
special mention here because this card
can barely be classed as ray tracing
compatible delivering performance barely
over 30 FPS at 1080p with DXi reflection
set too low it's clear that a mere 36 RT
cores and 6 gigabits per second of ray
tracing performance doesn't cut it for
actual real time ray tracing I'd be
bitterly disappointed if I bought an RT
X 2074 ray tracing
only to be left with that sort of
performance on the lowest settings in
battlefield 5 and I'm expecting a
similar story with other games that are
set to use ray tracing in the future
such as shadow of
writer and Metro Exodus everything we've
seen from demos of DXi in those games
suggests we're facing a similar
performance penalty to battlefield 5 for
a similar small increase in quality
we'll test those games with ray tracing
as soon as we can but I wouldn't be
holding out for anything better in
future titles so I guess that brings us
to the end of this initial battlefield 5
and DirectX ray-tracing evaluation we'll
have a full video breaking down the rest
of battlefield 5s quality options and
providing you with some optimal settings
in the next few days so subscribe and
stay tuned for that consider supporting
us on patreon to get access to our
exclusive discord chat and monthly live
