please a last week's episode we had 5
old Intel Core i7 based systems and need
a very supp grades I knew the viewers
voted a Howell's PC the most worthy of
receiving the proposed upgrade package
so coming hells way we have a risin 5
1600 processor a gigabyte p3 50
motherboard and 16 gigabytes of ddr4
3000 memory and that will all be coming
from pc case key thanks to those guys
for supporting the series and offering
free shipping before we get into the
next 5 pcs just a quick note to the
viewers do not forget to vote comment
and all that stuff each week because
that will put you in the running to win
some cool prizes and they are global
giveaways so anyone can enter last
week's we're not took home a very cool
AOC gaming monitor and this week's
winner will be announced at the end of
the video we have a pretty cool prize in
store for them alright then so it's time
to check out a random bunch of PCs for
this week this little gaming box was
built by Andrew back in 2014 during a
Black Friday he was after a compact and
portable rig they could take to medical
school when he was away from home the
system was initially built with a de
Graaff Excalibur he managed to score an
old GeForce GTX 460 from a friend who'd
upgraded to something more substantial
the pcs used mostly as a workstation but
Andrew also enjoys playing the odd games
such as minecraft medieval 2 total war
and civilization 3 Andrews brother also
recently gave him a copy of The Witcher
3 but doesn't really play that well in
the system and he would also like to try
out some new tales as well when he's not
working of course in order for Andrew to
enjoy more modern games I suggest we go
about things a little differently to the
norm rather than just ditch the has wild
platformer let's replace the dual core
Core i3 CPU with a Core i7 4790 it is a
costly upgrade but really there's no
better option as going rising or and 8th
gen CPU from Intel that would really see
us ditch the motherboard and a lack
memory this also leaves us with enough
money left over to grab a geforce gtx
1050 to our graphics card for 1080p
gaming this will have Andrew well
covered should he win and he can finally
enjoy The Witcher 3
next up we have snow that's it just snow
and you probably guess that snow
features the cute little Thermaltake
core v1 snow Edition Mini ITX case owner
ethan started piecing the system
together late last year after selling
his old athlon x4 860 k build to a
friend he then bought the core i7 6100
motherboard and memory from another
friend all right Ethan we get it you
have lots of friends stop making the
rest of us feel bad anyway where was I
yep after scouring the core components
he then took to eBay and picked up
pretty much everything else the idea was
to build a compact system to save space
on his desk the PC is used to game as
well as do a bit of photo and video
editing right now Ethan is mostly
playing fallout for overwatch and
Starcraft 2 finally a fellow sc2 player
it has to be said that right now Ethan
has a pretty decent turn DP gaming rig
but the core i3 6,100 process is
probably gonna start aging pretty
quickly now since he does have some ddr4
memory actually quite a bit of ddr4
memory let's just ditch the CPU and
motherboard in favor of the horizon 5
1600 and the asrock a be 350 gaming ITX
AC then because we can and also because
Ethan is suffering due to lack capacity
let's update the primary boot drive to
the crucial MX 300 525 gigabyte SSD that
we no need to shift around installed
games now moving up from core i3 s we
have a coffee part not a coffee Lake
there is quite a big difference
Evan built this PC at the start of 2014
and has since made multiple upgrades
he's added some case fans he's doubled
the memory capacity for making advise to
16 gigabytes and he's upgraded the box
cooler to the Noctua NHL 12 the PC is
now being handed over to his girlfriend
to replace her aging laptop which is on
the way out so if ever wins the upgrade
package will be going to his girlfriend
so she can game to her heart's content
Evan says she deserves that I can feel
the love now I'm told she does like to
play a broad
range of games but right now the system
just stutters really badly and even
games that aren't quite that old but a
little bit demanding games such as like
Assassin's Creed and BioShock Infinite
though bioshock's getting quite old now
anyway so we have to get this thing up
to speed the good news is there are a
few decent components already in the
system the coolermaster 1/2 912 case is
quite good and that corsair CX series
600 watt power supply get the job done
that said though the CPU motherboard and
memory they're not the best and probably
the graphics card as well will need to
be replaced
since the coffee like CPUs are either
out of stock or grossly overpriced right
now let's go Ryze and plus the Rison 5
1400 at 150 dollars u.s. right now it's
just a superstar let's slot that onto
the asrock a B 350 M motherboard with a
gigabytes of ddr4 memory finally capping
it off I think the GeForce GTX 1063 go
byte will be the way to go it handles
1080p gaming with ease overall if Evan
wins his girlfriend will be really able
to play games to her heart's content
okay so what we have here is a prebuilt
from australian computer store Cpl
William isn't the original owner of the
system he picked it up from his cousin
about two years ago who got it from a
friend he suspects it was purchased as a
business type PC anyway William ditched
the geforce 9600 GT that came in it and
replaced it with a second-hand GTX 650
Ti boost and while he was at it he threw
in a 120 gigabyte ocz SSD I'm pretty
impressed the OCZ SSD still works
actually I've had a lot of those died he
also upgraded the three true gigabyte
ddr3 memory sticks totaling six
gigabytes to a single 8 gigabyte stick
which I have to say was probably a bit
of a mistake as the core i7 920 process
of benefits from triple channel memory
operation the system is mostly used for
CAD work and William is an architect
students so he does do a lot of
rendering and he says a single image can
take hours to complete on this system
since rendering is the priority here
let's again go with the horizon 5 1600
and I recommend William overclocks this
thing as far as he can on the asrock a
be 350 pro 4
helping out with that let's throw in the
acquiring m9 a the motherboard does
offer four dimm slots so he can expand
the 8 gigabyte memory capacity down the
track quite easily should William win
he'll no longer have to wait hours for
his renders to complete last but
certainly not least we have Scott's
white knight which despite the specs was
actually built very recently using
hand-me-down parts from his friends this
is kind of nice in Scotts words he had
this to say
inspired by the content found in harbor
unboxed I thought I would give it a go
myself despite all my friends offering
to build it for me it was probably the
single most nerve-wracking experience
I've ever gone through however I was
exhilarated by the prospect that it
would be something many people have
never done that I constructed all by
myself overall he's been quite happy
with the system using it mainly to play
csgo the only issue being that he would
love to play pub G and sadly it just
doesn't run very well on the current CPU
and GPU combo I know that game in
particular hates one gigabyte graphics
cards even with the low quality settings
the Radeon HD 77 90 is probably the
biggest issue here that said I can't
leave a man behind no less in a
slow-moving bulldozer
so the FX CPU has to go as well
upgrading the CPU and GPU on this budget
of $500 u.s. budget is going to be very
tight especially once converted into
pounds still this does allow us to pick
up a horizon 514 hundred and m/s I'd be
350 M gaming pro at gigabytes of ddr4
memory and a GeForce GTX 1050 2 gigabyte
graphics card that will completely eat
up our budget every last dollar or pound
but it certainly will be enough for
Scott to enjoy pub G at 1080p
