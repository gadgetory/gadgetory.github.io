finally back from Kombat X and it is
time to get into our more regular
content today's video is one that I have
been planning for a while now but
somehow never seem to get around to
doing since the release of the second
generation rise in process as many of
you have been requesting a benchmark
comparison between the various AMD
chipsets in particular the x4 70 and be
350 chipsets and we're looking into this
I decided to go one step further and
include the a320 chipset as well for
this comparison we will be looking at
stock out-of-the-box performance with
the Rison seven 2700 X using the wraith
prism box cooler along with ddr4 3400
memory in addition we'll also be
tightening up the memory sub timings to
see if the optimized memory performance
differs from one chipset to another
previously we found very mixed results
when testing memory performance on the
a320 motherboards often finding them to
be considerably worse than similar price
to be 350 boards however all boards have
now been updated to support second
generalising processes and with that
also received improved memory support
representing the a320 chipset is the
a320 m pro 4 as your ox most premium
a320 motherboard which currently retails
for $65 u.s. the board officially
supports 105 watt TDP processors that
means the 2700 x should work without an
issue and asrock says you can even get
away with using a liquid cooler which
typically means less airflow over the
board's verum heatsink for those
wondering the board features a three
plus three phase verum and the vcore vrm
has three phases with a doubling of
everything for the be 350 chipset we
used the fatality a be 350 gaming k4 and
for the x4 70 chipset the mighty x4 70
Taichi ultimate barely chipset missing
from this comparison is the X 370 but
we've already established that there's
really nothing separating the B 350 and
X 370 chipsets in terms of performance
and memory support so with that let's
jump to the results first up we have the
memory bath result and as you can see
the performance is much the same across
the three boards tested even with the
enhanced sub timings I have to admit I
was quite shocked to see the a320 board
were
perfectly fine with the tightened
timings particularly given that this
exact motherboard wasn't that willing to
accept faster memory with the previous
biased revisions the Cinebench r15
scores were also much the same and we
saw no real increase in score when
trimming the memory sub timings moving
on to the corona benchmark and here we
see that the stock performance was
exactly the same on all three
motherboards however the tuned memory
sub timings did lead to slightly better
performance on the x4 70 MB 350 models
while the a320 was around three percent
slower the last application test we ran
was Excel 2016
using the Monte Carlo workload here the
x4 70 board did complete the test in the
shortest period of time though I should
point out that less than a percent
separated the fastest and slowest result
now for some gaming benchmarks and
starting with Assassin's Creed origins
we see little to no difference between
the various boards also chewing the
memory didn't really seem to help
improve performance in this title next
up we have ashes of the singularity and
here we do see some variation in
performance stop the x4 70 board was up
to 2% fast on the a320 board not a lot
though as we were only seeing a 1 to 2
FPS difference the margin grew slightly
with the tweaked memory sub timings and
now the x4 70 board was as much as 5%
faster though when compared to the be
350 board we did only see a 1 to 2 FPS
difference battlefield 1 performance was
virtually identical on all three boards
and the tuned memory offered a nice 10
percent performance bump again for all
three boards this time we're testing
with Far Cry 5 we see very little
difference between the B 350 and x4 70
boards while the a320 Bob was often just
one to two FPS slower finally the last
game tested was vermintide 2 and here
the a320 board was never more than two
and a half percent slower than the x4 70
model while the be 350 board basically
offered the same level of performance
okay so if you're not planning
overclocking which you probably aren't
if you intend on purchasing either the
2600 X or 2700 X then a cheat be 350
board will be just fine evidently an
a320 board will also suffice but giving
you are paying just $10 more for an
equivalent be 350 board and we've always
felt that that's just a more sensible
option of course if you're spending over
$300 u.s. on a rise in 720 700 X or over
200
you ask and I rise in five 2600 X you're
probably budgeting a little bit more
than say sixty to eighty dollars u.s.
for the motherboard also there are some
decent X 370 boards currently selling
for around $100 u.s. so if you are after
our high quality board but you do still
want something that's quite good value
then I recommend checking out some of
the X 370 boards that are currently
available the main takeaway here though
being that a decent be 350 board is able
to match a high and X 470 board in terms
of performance the fatality a be 350
gaming 4 also had no trouble pushing the
2700 X to an all-court overclock of 4.2
Hertz and with the tune sub timings the
performance was mighty impressive so
that being the case I have to admit to
making an incorrect assumption in my
risin 5 2600 vs. Core i5 8400 benchmark
comparison in that mega benchmark video
I said the following at the very least
the overclocked configuration will
require an upgraded cooler but for the
results shown here you'll also need a
quality motherboard and premium Samsung
B die memory during my initial second
gen rising coverage I did have some
trouble with the high performance memory
on 300 series boards with the early bass
revisions problems I didn't have with
any of the X 470 boards tested with so
much additional content to cover after
the second generalizer release it's
taken me quite a few months to get back
to 300 series chipset testing I would
have got this video out last week if it
weren't for Computex but anyway it's
done now so to clear up my previous
statement to achieve the overclocking
results shown the horizon 5 2600 vs.
Core i5 8400 head-to-head you require an
upgraded cooler and premium Samsung B
die memory but any old be 350
motherboard will suffice given that you
don't actually require a high-end
motherboard to take advantage of the
Samsung be drier memory and those
tweaked memory sub timings that makes
the optimizer rise and set up a little
more cost-effective in my top-five best
be 350 motherboards video I named the
Isuzu prime be 350 plus for $100 u.s.
the best value at X be 350 motherboard
available today I still stand by that
pick when looking exclusively at ATX be
350 boards and at around $40 US than the
cheapest X 470 models that is a decent
saving of course we do have B 450 boards
in coming next month and while they are
for the most part just reef
to be 350 boards there might be a new
best value option to look out for in any
case it's great to see memory support
continued improve for the Verizon
processors and that is going to do it
