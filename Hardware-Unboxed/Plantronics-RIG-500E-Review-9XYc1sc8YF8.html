bounds in the last few years as is all
gaming gear is eSport to continue to
grow and growth
enthusiasts and competitors thirst for
more and more customization than
Plantronics have aimed to quench this
thirst with their reek 500 line of audio
solutions the rege 500 series is
available in three different
configurations the regular rig 500 comes
equipped with clothes play the ear cups
and stereo sound followed by the 500 HD
the bose 7.1 surround sound and then
finally the reek 500 e this esports
Edition which I have on hand includes
not just 7.1 surround sound but most
interestingly two sets of ear cups the
standard closed pleather design from
previous models and additionally a set
of interchangeable vented ear cups with
mesh padding to reduce listening fatigue
both sets of ear cups pack the same
high-quality 40 millimeter drivers and
both me quickly and easily swapped in
and out from the headsets modular frame
i've complemented gaming headsets
previously for their partially modular
designs generally the cords can be
completely removed and sometimes
microphone 2 but have never seen a
design quite so modular as the rege 500s
up top the outer firm headband holds
everything else in shades and this stage
can be had in four different colorways
the standard black is what we have here
but then you can choose from blue grey
sand or fashion camo these are all
pretty specific patterns I think it
would have been good if there are some
more plane colors to pick from coz some
are better than none and could easily
paint the standard frame that comes with
it to suit you team colours clipping
into the frame first is the self
adjusting rubber headband wrapped in an
ESL cuff that comfortably wraps over the
top of your head I liked the amount of
resistance of this offered it was enough
to sit securely but certainly not enough
to give you a heck
amusingly as the cuff slides up over
bigger heads a funny little man with an
increasingly big afro was revealed on
the rubber band which is a fun little
touch next at the base of the frame
there's three little slots to choose
from when plugging in your ear cups each
to suit different sized heads when
connected the clever design still allows
the ear cups to move up and down which
allows the pressure to remain equally
spread on the side of your head the
overall comfort and ergonomics of the
headset are really great
they're so adjustable that'll be tough
not to be able to find a configuration
that sat nicely on your head even for
the longest of gaming sessions my only
gripe would be the actual size of the
ear cups they're definitely a size small
and weren't really close to fitting all
the way around my ears which is
something I really look for in a headset
also module is the mic boom which
securely plugs into the left ear cup its
shape is malleable to a degree but the
boom isn't overly long and it's a little
tricky to get it really close to your
mouth the mic is noise canceling and can
be flipped up and tucked away which also
mutes the microphone automatically being
able to both completely remove the mic
as well as having the option to fold it
away is great and not something we
usually see ah and in case you couldn't
tell I use it to record this section of
the audio not too shabby
when it comes to audio performance
Plantronics know what they're doing and
this is exemplified by the rig 500 line
the dynamic 40 millimeter drivers are
aided by low-frequency resonators to
improve low in performance and I found
both sets of ear cups to be good
all-around performers the isolating
clothes designed ear cuffs did of course
have superior sound performance
especially with mids and lows and these
will certainly be my preference for
music and movies if you don't get a hot
head then they'll be better for gaming
too the vented design ear cups with mesh
padding do feel a little lighter on the
head in ears but this comes at the
expense of lighter mids and lows - not
to say the sound quality wasn't good it
just wasn't as good but for long gaming
sessions these ear cups would probably
be the best choice especially if you're
likely to sweat it up a little and don't
like the feeling of the pleather
sticking to your face to enable the 7.1
surround sound a USB connector is
included - you also actually need to pay
attention to the Quick Start Guide is
only here could I find the URL to
download the rig 500 drivers once
installed my 7.1 surround sound was
active and I jumped straight into some
card and fallout 4 - tested out the
surround sound was as good and as
accurate as any of use before you can
tell the headset was tuned for gaming -
acoustics in first-person shooters were
very well suited in detailed and the
headset was particularly immersive with
the clothes designer cups in play on the
whole the rig 500 is really do feel like
an eSports specific headset in a lot of
ways this is a really good thing the
branding is cool the customization and
comfort is awesome and the sound
performance was excellent
what the
that misses in my opinion is an inline
mark and remote for use of smartphones
and some sort of option for bigger ear
cards is they simply weren't big enough
for my ears for sustained use beyond
that only the pricing will live at the
root 500 is sales I feel 150 US dollars
or 200 Australian is right up there
price-wise so you'd want to be taking
advantage of that extra set of ear cups
otherwise every five hundred and five
hundred HD a price much more
competitively at sixty dollars and
eighty US dollars respectively or one
hundred and one hundred and thirty
dollars Australian so what do you guys
think of the rig 500 series which one
would you be most likely to pick up let
me know in the comments and I'll see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
