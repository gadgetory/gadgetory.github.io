been really impressed with a variety of
new high-end smartphones coming out of
China lately before now I haven't had
much hands-on time with the Huawei but
thankfully the chinese brand is pushing
their new p9 in the big way I've been
lucky enough to be able to use it as my
daily driver for the past two weeks the
first thing I noticed about the pain I'm
was that it really strikes you as a
premium handset on first impression up
until this point I'd kind of considered
Huawei a budget brand but the p9 looks
wise is anything but a sandblasted metal
case houses the internals and wraps the
phone and an attractive finish that for
me it was very reminiscent of recent
high ends from both Apple and Samsung in
different ways the screen is 5.2 inches
and leaves a very thin bezel either side
adding to the premium look and feel at
the rear a black band houses the dual
locker cameras which themselves don't
protrude from the rear of the phone this
means at its thickest the phone measures
just six point nine five millimeters
making it thinner than the iphone
success and very comfortable to hold
looking around the rest of the phone
you'll see the fingerprint scanner at
the back middle which I found convenient
and very reliable as well as the Huawei
logo down the bottom the left top side
of the phone features the cmn SD card
tray and then on the right-hand side is
the function button and volume controls
on the bottom of the phone you'll find
the USB type-c and three-and-a-half
millimeter headphone jacks now you
probably notice that I said dual cameras
the p9 does in fact feature two separate
cameras on the rear of the phone plus of
course the front-facing 8 megapixel
selfie cam the same lens is featured in
both cameras at the back with two
different 12 megapixel sensors utilized
one's a full color sensor and the other
is a black and white only sensor the
idea is that the black and white sensor
can detect more variance in light
software then combines the two images
for a sharper result and far better
low-light performance here are a few
snaps side-by-side with some photos the
same subject taken with my galaxy note 4
for comparison
you
as you can see the results are really
good of course they aren't
earth-shattering it's still the phone
camera but for a phone camera I think
it's really good and it was definitely a
cut above my galaxy note form the phone
runs android 6.0 out of the box with the
huawei emu I skin on top this skin is
good in that it's fast smooth and
attractive there's a few things I didn't
love firstly there's no app tray so all
your icons are on the desktop what is
this an iphone definitely not my
preference i usually use nova launcher
anyway so this wasn't a huge problem but
i figure actually comment on the
launcher that the phone comes with
there's also a bunch of a chaps that try
to replace basic functions that everyone
just uses google apps for this is the
definition of bloatware really and i
prefer not to have it there as i
mentioned the phone is snappy and smooth
the paintings are quick with 3 gigabytes
of ram and an eight-core processor so
it's not gonna have any trouble with any
apps you throughout it I wasn't sure
what to expect battery while so the pain
I'm being so slim but actually packs a
3000 milliamp hour battery that will
last you a day of solid use the 1080p
screen is quite beautiful and it was
easily visible when outside in sunlight
its brightness can also be dialed down
fairly low so it's not too blind you
when you're having a quick look around
read it in bed overall I'm a fan of the
huawei p9 I really dig its overall looks
and feel and it really felt like a
premium handset the main selling point
the camera lives up to the hype and
certainly performs extremely well what
most people use their phone camera for
Instagram snapchat another social media
to be honest I wasn't a huge fan of the
software it looks fine but any sort of
bloatware really bothers me and I'd
prefer to have the pure Nexus Android
6.0 it's installing my trusty nova
launcher help though and after that I
really forgot about any issues I have
with it you'll have no issues picking up
the penile in Australia it's everywhere
just like it dads you can get the dual
CM international model from Cogan for
seven hundred dollars and of course the
main carriers all have it available on
their plans to on Amazon you can pick up
the p 9 for as little as 469 US dollars
so it really hits that in-between price
point it's better and a little pricier
than cheap chinese phones but also a
fair bit more affordable than the latest
and greatest from samsung and of course
Apple while way of won me over is a fan
of the brown 2 p-9 and I'll look forward
to seeing more products to this caliber
from them in the future what do you ask
