have what should be a rather impressive
pre-built system from PC case here we're
going to unbox it check it out and of
course play a few games on it I did just
finish downloading the new Middle Earth
shadow of war game as well so I'm keen
to see how that plays on this system but
of course before we can do that we do
need to unbox it and check out what is
inside of this new gaming rig
how well this system already looks very
impressive
the in wind 303 in video edition case
it's certainly very striking and I love
the green highlights along the front
here and of course who doesn't like a
nice big tempered glass panel this one's
even branded with the geforce gtx logo
so you know there's something good
inside at this point you probably
realized this is a very Nvidia themed
system and that's for good reason this
is a battle box for those of you who
don't know and video created the battle
box certification to ensure gamers what
they're buying is ready for serious
gaming action although I obviously like
to build my own pcs and I know many of
you do as well I understand that not
everyone wants to invest the time
researching components and going through
the process of building their own gaming
rig for those I just want to lay down
the cash and in return get something
that's ready for action well there's the
pre-built however not all pre-built are
built equally I've come across plenty of
gamers in my time they've defected from
consoles or just getting into PC gaming
for the first time and they've made the
mistake of buying an expensive gaming
system only to find out that while it
does come with an expensive core i7
processor it's paired with an
entry-level graphics card you certainly
can't blame novice users for seeing core
i7 and geforce on the specs list and
believing their set this is where the
battle box certification comes in there
are two types of battle boxes the
ultimate and essential the ultimate is
what we have here today to play with and
it calls for a core i7 or Rison 7 CPU as
the minimum 16 gigabytes of ddr4 memory
and SSD Windows 10 and AG sync display
if the system comes with a display so
any retailer selling a battle box
ultimate must meet or exceed those
specifications so what's in our system
from PC case gear then the brains of
this operation is a core i7 a 700 K and
I might have the last remaining one in
Australia right now anyway with its six
highly clocked cores and twelve threads
the 87 okay
a beast and the undisputed fascist
gaming sepia on the planet right now
the 8700 k is plugged into a very
sensible MSI z3 70 PC pro motherboard
but you could up for something like the
gaming Pro carb and if you wanted a few
extra features cooling the six core CPU
is the deep cool gamers still Maelstrom
240 T and I'm keen to see what temps we
get when gaming an even more bling to
this build is the team force Nighthawk
ddr4 3000 memory kit and of course we
have sixteen gigabytes II for the boot
drive the Samsung SSD 850 Evo 500
gigabytes been installed and for
secondary storage we have a much larger
but slower Seagate Barracuda 2 terabyte
then powering the system is the in
winning classic Series C 900 watt power
supply an insane 80 + Platinum certified
unit that delivers up to 92% efficiency
what else what else is inside this
impressive gaming rig yes of course and
NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 T I found
Edition graphics card yep that'll do
nicely the 1080i really needs no
introduction at this point if you
haven't seen my account less benchmark
videos featuring this beast then really
what have you been doing with your time
I'll link some of the videos in the
description below go check them out
anyway we've unboxed the battle box so
it's now time to do battle and see what
this thing's really capable of
unfortunately I don't have a g-sync
display on hand right now but I do have
a very impressive a soos 1440p 144 Hertz
display so I'll connect that up and
we'll get gaming Middle Earth shadow of
wall was tested at 1440p using the ultra
quality preset and unfortunately overlay
software isn't working right now
afterburner would cause the game in a
crash but I'm sure there'll be a river
tuna update in the not-too-distant
future anyway in the meantime you can
use the built-in benchmark to gauge
performance and here the battle box spat
out an average of 94 FPS while never
dipping below 65 fps here's a quick look
at some gameplay footage
captain leading the search is in the
lower city player unknowns battlegrounds
was also tested at 1440p and again I'm
using the ultra quality preset the
game's still really not that well
optimized but even so we did see an
average around 75 FPS when in the busy
areas and the game never dipped below 58
fps
I really wish I had more time to play
overwatch or really play overwatch at
all it seems like a really fun game and
I find myself fully captivated every
time I test out new hardware with this
title using the epic quality preset at
1440p we averaged around a hundred and
70 FPS and in the thick of it we never
dip below 140 FPS ignore the thirty-nine
FPS minimum that happened when alt
tabbing to the desktop via 140 FPS was
the minimum
I almost didn't get a chance to try at
the new Star Wars Battlefront 2 beta
results pretty busy testing your 8th gen
core processor series but I did seize my
opportunity when testing the battle box
and I had a few games the game looks
incredible and it seems to be a heap of
fun with the quality things maxed out
framerate stayed above a hundred FPS at
all times and we averaged around 120 fps
so a very smooth and enjoyable
experience then
for someone looking to invest in a
high-end gaming rig but doesn't have the
time I do all the necessary research or
certainly build one themselves then I
think getting a certified battleblock
system it's a surefire way of knowing
that you're getting something very
capable like we just saw 1440p high
refresh rate gaming isn't a problem I
guess it kind of goes without saying the
GeForce GTX 1080 Ti and the core i7
combo really is as good as it gets for
gamers right now this battle box system
for me really kills the notion that all
pre-built sar bad I priced up all the
components individually it looks like
you're paying PC case gear about a
hundred and fifty dollars Australian to
build and configure the system for you
and I have to say they do a very nice
job of it the cable management here was
excellent something I really appreciate
about this pre-built system is the fact
that it's using the kind of components
that enthusiasts like myself would put
in there anyway if I was to build the
system so it doesn't have a sort of
custom motherboard or something that's a
bit strange or sort of limits your
ability to upgrade the system in the
future with the platform the way it is
you really could upgrade the graphics
card two or three times into the future
before you need to get a whole new
platform so there's plenty of future
proofing
if you will in this system but anyway
the system worked exceptionally well
frame rates were silky smooth as you
just saw the operating temperatures were
really good and something I really liked
was the system was virtually silent I
suppose you should probably expect that
with an all-in-one liquid cooler but
even so very nice quiet system and in
case you haven't noticed the system
itself looks quite sweet I think you'll
probably agree well I hope you guys
enjoyed the video on a big thank you to
PC case key if not only building the
battle box but for sending it over and
giving us a chance to play with it and
check it out speaking of which if you
want to check out any of their pre-built
systems and I will provide a link in the
video description
this system here is now going to be
heading into Melbourne for the PAX 2017
trade show so if you're heading to the
event you can check this thing out in
the flesh thanks for watching I'm your
host Steve I'll see you again next time
guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
