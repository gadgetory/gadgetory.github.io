revisiting the Radeon r9 380 because a
lot of you have requested me to revisit
the Radeon r9 380 because I took a look
at the gtx 960 quite recently and didn't
include the 380 there because we were
looking at how the 960 whether the gtx
1660 is a good upgrade option for those
with 960s and that the 380 didn't really
fit into that comparison anyway I
thought since we have looked at the 960
we might as well compare the 960 and 380
head-to-head to satisfy those of you who
wanted to see that comparison happen now
both of these GPUs were released in 2015
and they both retailed for $200 u.s.
they were mid-range products though at
the time they were more what you would
consider to be sort of lower mid-range
budget mid-range
anyway in my day 1 review which was
published over on textbook because I
wasn't making videos four years ago I
found both GPUs delivered a similar
level of performance so I said the
following peaking between the r9 380 and
gtx 960 will come down to personal
preference and again the nvidia card has
an edge in power consumption cooling and
overclocking the reason the gtx 960 was
a more power efficient product was
largely down to the fact that it was
almost 40% smaller and both did use a 28
nanometer process though AMD used
globalfoundries while Nvidia used
TSMC however it wasn't too long before
AMD got their drivers sorted out and the
r9 380 started to pull ahead of the gtx
960 now four years later i've decided to
see how they compare and i'll be
comparing them to modern GPUs such as
the gtx 1660 and half a dozen other
models this testing was initially
intended to be used as an upgrade guide
so I'm not using dialed down quality
settings to try and find the 60fps sweet
spot with these old GPUs and I'm also
not retesting with the gtx 1050 or rx
560 for example as they are upgrade
options further of these GPUs rather the
intention here was to show you how much
faster products such as the gtx 1616 RX
590 are when all things are equal
after all if low-quality presets are
your jam then the r9 380 or gtx 960 will
still
vice but if you want to enjoy modern
games and all of their glory well
knowing how these GPUs perform using
higher quality settings really is a must
anyway hope that explains why I'm using
high to ultra quality presets at 30 P
okay so let's talk testing for this one
I'll be closely looking at performance
at 1080p and about a dozen titles and
then we'll jump to a 33 game breakdown
comparing the r9 380 and gtx 960
head-to-head along with an r9 380
comparison with the gtx 1660 then
finally the test system includes a kora
999 okay clocked at 5 gigahertz with 32
gigabytes of ddr4 3,200 memory ok let's
get into the results first up we have
apex legends and right away we see the
r9 380 is a good bit ahead of the gtx
960 hitting 51 fps an average opposed to
just 45 FPS this 13% boost was very
noticeable and in fact it's probably
more than 15% increase in 1% low
performance that you'll really notice
those of you keen on this title
something like the RX 570 will provide
almost a 50% boost in framerate or for
more than double the performance the gtx
1660 will work nicely well ok the
performance uplift seen in the division
2 is rather massive here there huh 9 380
was 44% faster than the GTX 960 this
isn't a particularly good title for
NVIDIA GPUs at least Pascal and older
and here we see the 380 was even 15%
faster than the 3 gigabyte gtx 1060 that
said with just 39 FPS on average you'll
want to dial down the quality settings
for playable formants alternatively
something like the RX 570 will produce
over 45% more frames moving on we have
shut out of the Tomb Raider and we find
yet another title where the r9 380 is
again debating the gtx 960 by a
comfortable margin this time was 18%
faster with 40 FPS on average and was
even playable at 1080p there again if
you want to use something like the r9
380 reducing the quality preset will
enable a smoother gaming experience
alternatively you could upgrade to a gtx
1660 for a 90 percent boost in
performance we see another shellacking
and Forza horizon for here the r9 380
decimated the gtx 960 by a whopping 31
percent margin
perhaps more surprisingly the 380
offered highly playable performance at
1080p with the ultra quality preset very
impressive stuff that this place the 380
roughly on path of GTX 970 so again a
very impressive result next up we have
hitman 2 and here the iodine 3d was 8%
fast on the GTX 960 the game was also
quite playable using the ultra quality
says it's an EP but for a 120 percent
performance uplift the GTX 1660 works
rather well the online 3d also does
reasonably well and just calls for I
mean it's not the world's most optimized
title and yet we're still seeing
playable frame rates at te p if only
just the gtx 960 on the other hand
wasn't really playable the 3d was just
6% faster for the average frame rate but
20% faster for the 1% low and this made
a significant difference the gaming
experience moving on we have Resident
Evil 2 and here we have another solid
win for the r9 380 and here we see a 15%
framerate increase over the GTX 960
again the game was playable using the
maximum quality preset but ideally you
will want to dial back the quality
settings or upgrade to something like a
gtx 1660 or RX 590 even in fortnight the
nvidia loving in battle rail the r9 380
still managed to edge out the gtx 960 at
this point you kind of have to ask the
question can the plucky little maxwell
GPU get a win in anything not sure about
that one will have to look a bit later
on the video but here was a whisker
slower though overall i would call this
one a tie performance was really close
in metro exodus here the r9 thready was
just 3 FPS faster though at these low
frame rates that did equate to an 11%
performance increased still for this one
you will absolutely need to wind down
the quality settings or upgrade to
something like a gtx 1660 which offered
a nice 90 percent performance boost no
surprises here the Pascal and older
architectures gets smoked in Rainbow six
siege here the r9 380 was 25% faster
hitting 60 FPS on average and providing
a noticeably better experience we see
another display of pure domination for
the r9 380 in battlefield 5 heroes 21%
faster than the gtx 960 the game was
also very playable as well and with a
few minor
tweeks could easily average over 60fps
in our test performance in World of
Tanks was pretty even this is an older
game that's continually updated but as
is the case with fortnight NVIDIA has a
bit of input here still the r9 380
managed to edge out the GTX 960 by a few
frames so overall a decent enough result
finally we have far cry new dawn and
here the r9 380 was 9% faster on average
but did deliver a smoother and more
consistent experience thanks to a 19
percent improvement in 1% Loeb hormons
okay so we're looking at total system
consumption here and the r9 380 is
somewhat let off the hook because we're
using a high-end rig for testing here
the total system consumption was
increased by just 12% we comparing the
r9 threading gtx 960 in a lower spec rig
that figure would likely grow to over
20% still even in this example we're
peeking it well under 300 watts so it's
not like you need a massive power supply
to handle the r9 380 you okay well that
appeared to be pretty one-sided in the
13 games that we just looked at but I
have of course tested 33 games
so let's swiftly move on and see if the
gtx 960 was able to win in any of them
well it did win in total war Warhammer 2
1 out of 33 isn't bad is it and we also
saw in Thai in f1 2018 performance was
also close in project cars to
Wolfenstein 2 warframe World of Tanks
fortnight quake champions and Ghost
Recon wildlands for the most part though
the r9 380 was faster by a 10% margin or
greater and this is reflected by the 33
game average which saw the 380
delivering 14% more performance the
performance uplift seen in strange
Brigade and the division 2 was massive
while we also saw big wins in Sniper
Elite 4 and Forza horizon 4 overall a
solid win for the r9 3 it's certainly
proven to be the better investment after
all these years to be honest the
findings won't be terribly surprising to
any of you who have been following the
progress of these two GPUs over the
years you'll be quite well aware that
the r9 380 has been getting the better
of the GTX 960
I myself often test these two GPUs and
new triple-a titles
we've seen time and time again that the
380 is a good bit faster than the GTX
960 for those of you who are still
rocking an r9 380 and are looking for an
upgrade now something like a cheap rx
570 that'll work quite well
alternatively if you are looking at
spending around $200 then I strongly
suggest the gtx 1660 the gtx 1660 was
87% faster on average and bara few tiles
offered at least a 50% performance
uplift
moreover we saw gains of around a
hundred percent or better and a dozen of
the titles tested so the 1660 is
certainly a worthy upgrade if you've
been holding out all this time for now
