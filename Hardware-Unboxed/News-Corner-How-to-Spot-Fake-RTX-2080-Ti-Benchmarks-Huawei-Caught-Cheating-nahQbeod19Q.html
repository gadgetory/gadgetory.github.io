News commonhelp
I guess this actually makes two news
episodes in a row considering we covered
the AMD Athlon 200 GE in a separate
video yesterday actually cuts out a bit
from today's news corner so any like
it's a bit of a shorter one anyway in
today's episode we'll be covering some
Intel adaptive so you can use benchmark
cheating from Huawei and discussing a
bit about a recent 20 atti benchmark
leak so we're actually going to start
with the 20 80 TI benchmark leaks
because I want to discuss these in a bit
of detail going on the information we
know right now about the RT X launch as
is the case with pretty much any major
hardware launch a couple of weeks before
the release date we start to see these
sorts of benchmark leaks from websites
and YouTube channels no one has ever
heard of before fact I reckon a lot of
the time these sketchy sources are never
heard from after the leaks either anyway
what we have here is a Turkish youtuber
called PC Hawk Ozzy TV or something like
that they briefly published a set of
benchmarks comparing the r-tx 20 atti to
the gtx 1080 TI in 10 games the video is
apparently up for a short period of time
and then removed but it was up long
enough for websites like 3d Center to
collect the results and do a quick
comparison now you can see the results
here everything looks fairly standard
for a comparison we have some numbers in
the first column there's a few different
numbers in the second column and a few
more numbers in the other columns in
general this channel is claiming the
r-tx 20 80 TI is somewhere between 22
and 55% more powerful than the 1080 TI
which i guess it sounds reasonable let's
explore the issues with this one firstly
Steve watched the video when it was live
and immediately noticed that not once do
they actually show they had an RT X 20
atti in their hands it would be pretty
strange to have access to one of the
most anticipated graphics cards this
year but then not to actually show it
off at all if it was a review
accidentally published early you
definitely expect to say the physical
card in all its glory and if it was a
deliberate early leak you'd want to show
off the card so everyone can see you
actually
one which legitimizes the results one of
the tests was battlefield 5 and this
immediately throw up another red flag
this benchmark video was published
before the battlefield 5 open beta began
on September 4th for pre-order owners
and obviously well after the closed
alpha in June so to have benchmark that
title for this video that have to have
exclusive developer access which seems
unlikely but the most important thing to
note is that as far as we know at this
stage most reviewers don't actually have
their hands on our TX 2080 or our TX
2080 Ti hardware and this isn't unusual
most companies don't ship out their
review samples until around a week
before the launch that's a pretty
typical situation so whenever you see
elite performance from more than a week
prior to launch
you should immediately be suspicious of
those results simply because most people
don't actually have the hardware of
course there doesn't rule out someone
actually you know getting their hands on
Hardware through other channels but then
there's another thing to know companies
also don't release their final or near
final drivers for their hardware until
very close to launch in fact getting a
week with the final driver for an NVIDIA
GPU would be amazing often it's only a
couple of days ahead of time board
partners will usually have an
engineering driver to test their cards
but the final driver complete with
optimizations is only available through
Nvidia and usually it isn't distributed
to partners before reviewers get their
hands on it so with any of these leaks
this far out from the release it's very
unlikely we're seeing results from final
hardware with final drivers and most
often these sorts of things are just
completely fake this leak in particular
looks garbage to us and honestly it's
not that hard to just make up some
numbers there was another leak this week
put up by video cards showing a photo of
a 3d marked time spire score for the
28th ETI the GPU is listed as an Nvidia
graphics device which suggests the use
of engineering drivers and in case
you're wondering the score of twelve
thousand eight hundred and twenty five
is about thirty five percent higher than
you'd get from a 1080 Ti this is a much
more believable leak but as always like
to take these things with this guess a
grain of salt again there's not a lot of
evidence to verify this number and even
though it is a photo of a screen with
the section redacted it's not hard to
fake that sort of thing either the only
reason I'm saying this is more
believable is it video cards actually
has a history of
posting accurate information ahead of
time but in this case we'll have to wait
and see enough on debunking r-tx 2080 TI
legs let's look at some real news
Michael announced this week but they are
the launch partner for invidious r-tx
graphics cards providing their GDD r 6
memory for the cards in a press release
filled with stock images including this
ridiculous wafer vr gaming seriously
what is going on in this image Mike once
said early efforts with gddr5 and gddr5
X helped to strengthen the relationship
and build a highly collaborative effort
between Nvidia and Mike on to deliver JD
dr6 in lockstep if you might recall
micron was the exclusive supplier of
gddr5 X for high-end pascale cards
micron doesn't state they are an
exclusive partner or anything for GD dr6
we already know Samsung also providing
the memory for some products in
particular Nvidia squad Rho RT X cards
but it's likely that both manufacturers
will be providing GDD r 6 for a wide
range of in video cards considering
Nvidia would be one of the largest
customer support JD dr6 throwing SK
Hynix as well who are reportedly working
with Nvidia to intel has reconfirmed
that they will be supporting the visa
adaptive sync standard in their upcoming
GPUs until first announced support for
adaptive sync at IDF three years ago but
since then there hasn't been any word on
when adaptive syncs support was coming
or even whether adaptive sync was still
in Intel's plans but this week Chris
hook confirmed that adaptive sync is
still planned for a future generation of
Intel GPUs Intel hasn't clarified when
adaptive sync will be supported but it
won't be for at least another generation
the feature is not supported in cable X
integrated GPU and that GPU is basically
the same in the rest of Intel's 40
nanometer plus plus plus plus plus plus
lineup including coffee lake and whiskey
Lake I guess at this stage that Intel
are planning to support adaptive sync in
their next gen 10 nanometer
architectures but due to a series of
delays with 10 animator that date keeps
getting pushed back and also be
extremely surprised if Intel's discrete
GPU scheduled for launch in 2020 did not
include adaptive sync support and yes
phaser adaptive sync is basically the
same as fruity so when Intel gets around
to supporting adaptive sync you'll get
variable refresh support on freesync
monitors with Intel GPUs this one isn't
really PC highway news but it's still
pretty funny Huawei have been caught
benchmark cheating with their latest
phones under both the Huawei and honor
brands and we're not just talking about
a little bit of benchmark cheating we're
talking full-blown major benchmark
cheating the sort of stuff they gets you
caught embarrassingly red-handed and
then tech discovered that phones such as
the p20 Pro and honor play were
detecting benchmarking applications via
the app ID or name and putting the phone
into a special secret high performance
mode they're significantly boosted the
CPU and GPU performance relative to
regular everyday usage UL which formally
future mark the company that develops
3dmark which is also available for
phones found that some huawei phones
performed up to 47 percent higher in
public benchmarks compared to modified
benchmark apps that the phone cannot
detect and optimized for and we're
talking 47% faster in the exact same
benchmark tests this is pretty poor
behavior from huawei benchmark cheating
may seem like a small issue but it's
essentially false advertising as the
phone performs significantly differently
outside of detectable benchmark apps
review sites that use these benchmarks
are basically betraying the phones is
faster than they actually are in
real-world workloads
and that's not the fault of the
reviewers but obviously a huawei for
cheating and it's worse than that as
plenty of users download these
benchmarks to do a bit of testing
themselves to see how their phone stacks
up but in the case of these huawei
phones the scores they're getting
another reflection of real-world game
performance on top of that benchmark
cheating can paint a smartphone as being
much more efficient than it really is
for example a phone could be shown to
have great battery life in its standard
everyday performance mode but then had
shown to also have outstanding results
in benchmark so you might get the idea
it's a great mix of bachelors and
performance but in reality the
performance you will achieve in apps on
battery is nowhere near the level shown
in benchmarks hence the better battery
life it's not a shock to anyone but
cheating in benchmarks is bad and it's
also super dodgy anyway in response to
this cheating ul banned several Huawei
phones from their 3dmark leaderboard for
breaking their app
detection rules now that's a big deal
for huawei as buyers looking at the
chance to figure out which phones offer
the best performance will no longer see
devices like the p20 Pro among genuine
top-end contenders like the galaxy note
9 + 1 + 6
however while way says they are planning
to provide users with access to the
performance mode so they can use the
maximum power of their device when they
need to final topic for this week ek
water blocks have announced a series of
new water blocks for NVIDIA Tsar TX 2080
and r-tx 2080 ti at least the reference
versions of these cards the GPU water
blocks don't come cheap but they will
allow those that use open-loop liquid
cooling to integrate these cards into
their cooling loops and achieve the
usual stuff like better temperatures for
better over clocks the blocks are full
coverage so they cover the diet memory
and VRMs there also are several versions
available depending on your requirements
the cold plate comes in either
electrolytic copper or nickel plated
electrolytic copper while the cover is
available in either transparent
Plexiglas or black acetal plastic if you
get the nickel plated cold plate version
you'll also get integrated RGB strips
for extra bling and of course back
plates are also available in either
black or nickel pricing for the
waterboxx range from around 125 us to
140 dollars u.s. depending on the
version while the back plates are about
40 bucks
