hardware everyday so I guess you'd say
I'm a little hard to impress at times
but something that legitimately
impresses me is the progress of really
small form-factor low-power pcs today
I've got as rocks new desks mini one 10
on hand and that a 1.9 2 litre capacity
this thing is tiny but how much of a
punched as a pack let's take a look and
find out looks wise the Deaf's mini is
kind of industrial with sharp edges and
straight lines almost all around there's
a big grade on the top and sides with
some additional holes and indentations
at the front which on this model aren't
used and honestly aren't exactly
striking the Front's a little better
though and employs some all right
looking diagonal lines there's a small
i/o panel here too that includes audio
jacks USB type-c and USB 3 port there's
also 2 LED indicators and of course the
power button with an emblem that suits
the unit being in its vertical stance
moving around to the back there's also
plenty of ventilation alongside the main
i/o panel of device here we find the DC
power input at a spy port and HDMI port
legacy VGA port and a Gigabit Ethernet
connection above a USB 2 and USB 3 port
to pop the unit open to make any
upgrades or clean out dust there's four
screws that need to be removed quite a
lot less than it's often the case with
these small form-factor pcs once these
screws are gone you can simply slide out
the innards along the included vales and
voila this little ass Rock h1 10m STX
motherboard uses the LGA 1151 socket and
supports all six Gen Intel Sky
processors little plug into it the
chipset used is obviously the Intel H
110 dual DIMM slots are available for
memory and the maximum capacity is up to
32 gigabytes by to 16 gigabyte modules
this chipset can run ddr4 220 133
megahertz Hardware expansions can be
made and there's an included m2 slot for
nvme SSDs as well as an e key slot for a
Wi-Fi and Bluetooth module the
motherboard used includes three SATA
headers onboard although there's only
really spaces for two drives by default
so you have to get creative to squeeze a
third Drive in lastly the onboard audio
is powered by the realtek ALC 283 codec
and the
network ports handle by Intel's gigabit
I to one 9v controller both of which
will comfortably do a reliable job with
all that covered let's see how this
little pocket rocket performs for our
tests we use a core i5 6400 CPU along
with 16 gigabytes of g.skill ddr4 memory
kick starting the benchmarks we are pc
mark eights home test the core i5 6400
gives the desk mini an advantage over
other systems tested and as a result it
produced our best mini pc result yet
with a score of three thousand 17 points
the decimal you just edged out the a10
7800 desktop system and also beat the B
box s that I reviewed recently the
decimal you also crushed the creative
test scoring 3924 points which again
made it slightly faster than the a-10
7800 desktop test system for any kind of
productivity work the core i5 6400
desktop processor gives the desk mini a
serious advantage over other small
form-factor pcs here it's called three
thousand four hundred and forty points
making it 27 percent faster than the
a-10 7800 system and forty-one percent
faster than the B box s cinnamon shows
just how much more powerful the desktop
core i5 processor really is the single
thread score of 140 points is very
strong though is the multi-threaded
performance that sets the desk mini
apart able to take advantage of a true
quad core processor produced a score of
516 points in our 7-zip test the desk
Mini enjoys a serious performance
advantage over other small form-factor
pcs such as the B box thanks to its
ability to support quad-core processors
the core i5 6400 didn't just crush the B
box s but also did away with the AMD a10
7800 as well equipped with the right
processor the desk mean he even makes do
as a decent encoding machine delivering
43 FPS in the first pass test the core
i5 in our desk Mini features Intel HD
graphics 530 while the B box s uses HD
graphics 520 they're essentially the
same GPU as both both 24 execution units
that said the HD graphics 530 is clocked
a little higher as a result the
jessamine he comes out on top the margin
in favor of the destiny is greater than
expected given how similar the
integrated graphics are that said the
game is quite CPU intensive and I
believe the stronger quad core Core i5
processor
makes up the difference here the
decimating was slightly slower than the
beatbox s when testing with camera
strike global offensive though
admittedly there was very little limit
the data mean he comes home strong and
overwatch as it almost matched the a-10
7800 with an average of 66 fps making it
quite a bit faster than the beatbox s ad
Idol definitely consumed just 16 watts
with the core i5 6400 installed an
impressive result given the performance
just seen under load the decimate looks
much more like your typical desktop
system consuming over 60 watts of power
in comparison the B box has consumed
around three times less when just
stressing the processor nevertheless
when you consider the performance
delivered by the desk mini the power
consumption is still very impressive
there's a lot of things about the asrock
desk Mini that I really liked in fact
given the price I really found it hard
to fault
some users aren't going to be impressed
with its look so let's be honest but
having said that it looks fine and it's
not like you're walking around wearing
this thing on your wrist as rock we've
kept things really simple and one
distinct advantage of this was how easy
it was to access the interior of the
device the performance is also really
impressive as the Deaf's mini is capable
of harnessing some very serious hardware
inside including uncommon ly seen in
small form-factor items such as the 65
watt TDP core i7 6700 thanks to the
handy amount of extra space and the
plentiful ventilation the unit will also
stay relatively cool space for two two
and a half inch drives is awesome as is
the fact that the m2 slot is tied
directly to the CPU so it can fully
utilize nvme SSDs a couple more USB
ports would probably be welcomed by most
users as would an included Wi-Fi adapter
but I was impressed that USB type-c is
included for an MSRP of 140 US dollars
though for the bare-bones unit it's
pretty tough to complain unfortunately
there's still no stock down under so I
can't quote Ozzy pricing just yet what
do you guys think the desk Mini 110 let
me know in the comments I'm your host
