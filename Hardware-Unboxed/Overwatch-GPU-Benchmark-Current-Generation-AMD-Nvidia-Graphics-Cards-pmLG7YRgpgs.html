and today I'm back to take a look at the
brand new overwatch game from Blizzard
like most PC gamers I'm a massive
Blizzard fan and I've been eyeing off
overwatch for some time I had a pretty
good go at the beta when that was out
for a few days - and that was a lot of
fun
overwatch strikes me as the new better
looking deeper an extremely polished
version of Team Fortress 2 I did play
tf2 a little back in the day but not
extensively so I can't really make an
in-depth comparison but the play style
and character roles definitely reminded
me of it
one thing I instantly liked about
overwatch is there's no pay2win BS
natural character skills and attributes
aren't improved simply by playing
ridiculous hours I find it super painful
playing what a ment to be competitive
online games using the pay to win or
grind for better gear models it's
plainly simply an uneven battlefield and
that takes away from both the experience
and the satisfaction of winning so
Cheers Blizzard doing it this way for
those that don't really know what
overwatch is in its most basic form it's
two teams of six players fighting to
control them in specially designed Maps
there are 21 different heroes each with
extremely varied talents and abilities
designed to play our certain roles in
their teams the weapons and special
powers the heroes have are also varied
and even the mobility of each one is
completely different being able to climb
vertically in overwatch is a valuable
and actually quite uncommon commodity
something I loved about the variety of
heroes was that they often felt themed
to gaming favorites of old flying and
popping up rockets with Farah was a
flashback to rocket arena the simplicity
of soldier 76 feels like standard Cod
and running across walls with lucio
remaining means the short time I played
titanfall the art style is futuristic
and a little cartoony setting the scene
from what's an often light-hearted a bit
fiercely competitive contest maps are
relatively simple and not overwhelmingly
big and experienced players can take
advantage of choke points and higher
ground that new players will be
completely unaware of the best part of
overwatch is that to be truly successful
teamwork really is essential forget
about playing in a cod server for hours
without muttering a word and simply
running around solo chasing frags teams
to work together well and strategize
will win and overwatch I've got a
feeling that's what's gonna make it so
addictive
from my time spent playing overwatch it
appears to be one of the deepest
competitive shooters created in a long
time with such an extensive selection of
Heroes to learn and a wealth of well
thought-out maps players of all levels
will have a lot to learn and will enjoy
growing into and perhaps eventually
mastering their favorite heroes I
couldn't find a lot of information on
the game engine overwatch employees
apart from the fact that it's a
proprietary one created specifically for
the game as such I've been really keen
to start testing with our current
generation cards or is the last
generation now either way let's get into
the results all cards have been tested
using the epic quality setting and I've
tested at 1080p 1440p and 4k the
earliest control map was used for
testing both teams are loaded with a are
controlled BOTS in the test ran for
three minutes
an average of three runs was taken and
I'll be reporting the minimum and
average frame rates finally the latest
AMD and NVIDIA drivers designed for
overwatch were used for more information
on the driver versions used and the full
test system specs please check the video
description
as you can see with absolutely any of
the cards in our test range you're gonna
have an extremely smooth gaming
experience and overwatch with every
setting maxed out at the bottom of the
table is the GTX 970 which was still
able to render at average of 98 frames
per second at a minimum of 88 as you can
see it only goes up from here and the
minimum and averages are consistently
quite close together those using high
refresh rate monitors will be able to
tweak a couple of settings and be
relatively happy with any of these cards
and those were the 980ti are above will
be able to max everything out
comfortably
moving onto 1440p games of the 970 or
above we'll still be able to max every
setting out and get a minimum of 55
frames per second or higher and expect
an average of 65 fps or higher again the
minimums and averages are extremely
close together which indicates to me
this is a very well refined engine end
game here the fury X or nearly a hundred
FPS on average the GTX 1080 led the way
with 134 fps the i-93 90 was solid as
always pulling 70 FPS of its own finally
we'll move on to the Big Daddy 4k
resolution here a lot of our cards have
finally challenged and over one fell
below the magical 60 FPS mark though I
wouldn't dare say that made it
unplayable because apparently that can
really upset some people thankfully all
cards including the 970 in I know 390
were able to pull over 30fps on average
so those that are happy to play a
slightly lower frame rates will be able
to do so at 4k soaking up overwatch and
all of its epic quality glory I'm really
impressed by the way the blizzard has
been able to produce a game that in my
opinion looks absolutely awesome and
also runs so well in a variety of
hardware it shouldn't really come as a
surprise Blizzard are known for their
excellent optimisation and refinement as
well as their a fusible Rasha game
release an overwatch is another shiny
example of this also remember that all
of these tests were conducted at games
epic quality settings
meaning everything was completely maxed
out if you wanted to get a solid 60 FPS
for example with a card that wasn't able
to hear I dare say you could comfortably
by lowering some of the quality settings
overall overwatch is a very solid
refined balance and deep multiplayer
experience from Blizzard that I have no
doubt I'll be clocking some serious
hours in it's a really great blend of
attractive visuals well-thought-out map
designs engaging gameplay and a huge
variety of playable characters
be coming back for more and developing
strategies at the water cooler with your
teammates
I'm your host man as always and I'll
catch you on the blizzard service soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
