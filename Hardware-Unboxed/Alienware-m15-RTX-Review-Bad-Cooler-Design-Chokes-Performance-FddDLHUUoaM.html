taking a look at another gaming laptop
this time the brand new Alienware m15
which is their portable laptop offering
to rival systems like the msi tier 65
stealth the gigabyte air of 15 and razor
blade historically I haven't been a huge
fan of Aylan wears chunkier laptop
designs but the m15 is one of the best
I've seen from the company so far as
always let's talk specs to begin with if
you've seen reviews of this laptop from
a few months ago those were probably for
the original model that used invidious
GTX series Pascal GPUs where I'm
reviewing today is the RT X version in
particular the RT X 28 Emacs q model but
there are other options available that
might suit your budget better including
the RT X between 70 max Q and RT X 2060
like a lot of Dell laptops the m15 is
highly customizable the CPU for most
model stays the same as an Intel Core i7
8750 H but from there you get many
storage ram and display options my unit
came with 16 gigabytes of jewell channel
ddr4 plus a combination of a 500 gig SSD
and a one terabyte hard drive the
displays are 15.6 inch 1080p 144 hertz
IPS the m15 is Alan wears most portable
15 inch gaming laptop design yet while
this is definitely a good thing it's
probably only good when comparing the
m15 to alien wares other laptops for
example the regular Alienware 15 is 30
millimeters thick and about 3.5 kilos
heavy whereas the Alienware m 15 is
about 27 millimeters thick and crucially
just 2 point 2 kilograms heavy the
weight difference in particular is
massive which makes the m15 a
significantly more portable system
however if you're compared to say the
gigabyte over 15 the Alienware 15 is
larger in all dimensions gigabyte system
is only 22 millimeters thick using the
same measurement system and weighs just
a tad over 2 kilograms it's also smaller
in footprint due to slimmer bezels the
Alienware 15 really doesn't give you
that awesome slim bezel design that
we've seen from other gaming laptops
which keeps it larger than its
competitors its
this new unit is a big step forward for
Alienware but it's still got a way to go
until it matches the best from its
competitors something like the msi ge62
5 is a good 400 grams lighter and for
some people that could be a better
option however there is no vaulting to
build quality here which is superb this
isn't a unibody construction and there
are a few different choices of materials
including metal for the lid a soft touch
matte plastic coating around the
keyboard and glossy plastic around the
display but the key here is just how
seamless these materials join together
it just feels really solid and well
built visually this isn't my favorite
design mostly due to the angular body
and gamer e lid it looks quite nice when
opened but it doesn't do enough to take
the crown from the elegant msi gs70 the
best Alienware design and the focus on
slimness has helped a lot here though in
other areas a lean wear has done a lot
of things right the keyboard has a nice
though somewhat spongy tactile response
however the layout is good and it
includes a full numpad + 4 macro keys
the entire thing is lit up with 4 zone
RGB backlighting there's two other RGB
elements as well the power button and
alien head logo on the lid the trackpad
is a little small given the space
allocated to it but it has a nice
coating and it is very responsive the IO
selection here is fantastic we're
getting three USB 3.1 type-a ports
Thunderbolt 3 HDMI 2.0 mini DisplayPort
a 3.5 mm audio jack Ethernet and alien
wares graphics amplifier port I
particularly like that the display
outputs are on the rear of the laptop
it's nice and convenient to hook up a
display there without obstructing either
side let's talk about performance and as
always it's important to set the scene
here with the settings I used the main
consideration here are the fan profiles
with Alienware providing four options
balanced which is the default option
plus cool quiet and performance modes
I didn't spot any significant difference
between the balanced and the top-tier
performance modes because both seem to
ramp up the fan to the same level while
gaming the performance mode simply sets
this fan speed at all times while
balanced quietens the fan during less
intensive workloads my recommendation is
to use the balanced mode and that's what
I used throughout this review when it
- CPU performance my main consideration
here is to see whether the Alienware m15
performs any differently in productivity
tasks compared to other laptops that use
the intel core i7
8750 H what I discovered is that the
laptop performs identically to our
average
8750 H benchmark numbers suggesting the
system is performing as expected of
course each workload it's a little
slower sometimes and a little faster at
other times but on average there is
nothing to be concerned about here it
does perform as expected this means
we're getting all the usual benefits of
the core i7 8750 H as it's a six core
CPU it's ideal for tasks like video
editing in on-the-go where it's 40 to 50
percent faster than a last generation
Core i7 7700 HQ CPU it's also fast in
single third workloads by around 10%
which does help reduce CPU bottlenecks
in some games where the interesting
stuff starts to happen is with the GPU
here we're looking at the NVIDIA GeForce
r-tx 20 80 max Q in its 90 watt
configuration I wish to my review unit
if you aren't aware there are actually
two versions of the r-tx 28 Emacs cube
that have been spotted the default 80
watt configuration and the 90 watt model
which has a higher power women and is
clocked about a hundred to 200 megahertz
higher it's almost impossible to tell
which version a laptop uses from its
product page but we can tell you here
that the m15 uses the faster 90 watt
model if you've seen my review of the
GeForce r-tx 2080 max Q you'll see how
both the 81 and 90 watt versions perform
in a range of games however with the
Alienware m 15 it's a bit more
complicated than that because while the
laptop does have the 90 watt version
it's cooling solution in a typical use
case prevents it from unleashing the
full power of this GPU even with the
fans at full speed there just isn't
enough of a gap between the base of the
laptop and the desk to intake air at the
volume required to call these components
most of the intake vents are along the
bottom panel with a few tiny vents on
the top side with air then exhausting at
the back and sides but thanks to the
feet raising this laptop by a smaller
than usual height and fewer vents on the
top side of the laptop we are running
into a few airflow bottlenecks what this
means is the Alienware m15 in a typical
usage environment on your desk is four
percents
on average than the maximum performance
the r-tx 2080 max q 90 watt variant is
capable this is a pretty disappointing
result give an alienware have gone to
the trouble of including the faster 90
watt model it's actually a bit strange
that we're getting the 90 watt variant
only to see it chose to to the cooler
design however it is possible to get the
full performance of the 2080 max q if
you raise the base of the laptop
slightly which gives the bottom vents
less restricted access to airflow you
don't have to change any other laptop
settings you just have to make this
physical adjustment if you do this the
cooler performs much better and you get
the full performance of the GPU inside
however it's not a very practical
solution I feel this issue could have
been resolved with a better optimized
series of vents around the design for
the rest of this data I'm showing you
how the Alienware m15 performs without
the base race because I feel this is how
most people will use the laptop the good
news is that when sitting on your desk
normally the only way m15 performs
around the same as the r-tx 20 80 max q
80 watt variant so it's not choke to the
level that it performs below a typical
RT X 20 80 max Q it's merely the same
you don't get the benefit of the 90 watt
configuration but it's not throttling so
hard that you aren't getting a decent
level of performance and I guess the
good news is that by Ellen we're
choosing the 90 watt model you can
actually achieve better performance if
you give the cooler better airflow
laptops that use the 80 watt model can't
push much faster even in optimal cooling
positions with the Alienware m15
performing roughly the same as an 80
watt RT x 2018 max q the margins between
this laptop and other GPUs is pretty
similar to what I showed in my review
it's 10% faster than the RT x 2070 MX q
on average so if you are tossing up
between the various everywhere m15 CPU
configurations this might be data that
will interest you the other available
GPU is the RT X 2016 here the RT x 2018
max Q is 16% fast on average although it
doesn't win in every game for example in
hitman two it is unusually slow with the
Alienware m15 compared to the average
result for other laptops we've tested on
the other hand there is a significant
lead in games like shadow of war where
the 2080 max Q is more than 30% faster
the Alienware m15 was previously
available with the geforce gtx 1070 max
Q inside the
new r-tx 2080 max-q model is a decent 24
percent faster on average which as I've
mentioned before is an impressive
improvement from the same sort of cooler
design and form factor the ITX 2080
max-q models are a lot more expensive
but that's typical for premium hardware
and finally we have the comparison
between the r-tx 2080 max-q and the
standard gtx 1074 laptops the ITX 20 nm
X cube is 6% faster on average but it's
a bit of a mixed bag it wins in some
titles and loses in others it's
definitely not a situation where the RT
X 2080 demolishes the GTX 970 which is
the case when comparing the desktop
variants of these GPUs here is the data
showing the Alienware M 15 cooling
solution really isn't up to scratch for
the hardware inside GPU temperatures are
actually okay with that being great 84
degrees Celsius is fine for most gaming
laptops but it's the CPU temperatures
that are seriously crazy with the m15
hitting 99 degrees during a watchdogs to
gaming session any time a laptop is up
around that a hundred degree mark you're
gonna get throttling so with this laptop
it's not GPU throttling that's the
primary issue it's mostly CPU throttling
raising the laptops base which provides
more airflow to the choked cooler
without increasing fan speed sees a
significant 7 degree drop on the CPU and
a similar drop on the GPU but it's
actually more than that CPU clock speeds
also increase by 500 megahertz or so
across all six cores
it's a huge difference and just shows
how in a standard usage case this cooler
cannot keep up with the demands of the
high TDP parts inside without that CPU
bottleneck we see the full performance
of these components unleashed and it's
no surprise why the Alienware m15 can't
push the fan any faster we're already
sitting at 46 DBA during a gaming load
which is on the high end for a gaming
laptop so this system is both hot and
loud giving basically no room to move if
you're hoping to overclock the system
well has really no Headroom for that
those that like to under vault and
replace the thermal compound with
something like liquid metal may be able
to get more out of this cooler design
it's also possible that lower tier GPUs
like the RT X 2060 won't run into the
same thermal bottleneck but it's hard to
say for sure without testing those units
moving on to storage performance my
Alienware m15 came equipped with a 512
gigabyte sk hynix pc 401 SSD which
performed pretty well no real complaints
here it's not the absolute fastest
gaming SSD I've seen in laptops
particularly for sequential workloads
but it's adequate enough for most people
match your life was pretty disappointing
though the m15 comes with two battery
options if you want a one terabyte hard
drive inside you get just a 60 watt hour
cell which is the default which was the
case with my review unit if you forego
the 2.5 inch drive base slot you can
increase the battery capacity to 90 watt
hours which no doubt delivers better
results than the disappointing sub 4
hour runtime in our video player
test given that internally you get 2m
not two slots one of which was free in
my unit and both of which are easily
user accessible I think most buyers
would be better off opting for the 90
watt hour model and using cheap M naught
to storage options to get extra space if
necessary especially if you want better
battery life which I feel is important
in a portable oriented system like the M
15 lastly we have the display and like a
lot of similar laptops Alienware are
using a 15.6 inch 1080p IPS with a
maximum refresh rate of 144 Hertz
the combination of IPs and 144 Hertz
works really well here for gamers the
high refresh rate is perfect for the
artex 2080 max-q that often pushes frame
rates above 100 FPS at 1080p so this
really is the display option you'll want
to choose a lot of the basic
characteristics here are good 300 nits
of peak brightness is fine for indoor
use especially as that's combined with
excellent viewing angles a contrast
ratio of 1200 to 1 is also great for
this type of display however I did
experience a bit of IPS glow when
viewing dark or black content not a huge
issue but something to keep in mind the
bigger problem with this display is the
lack of color calibration the default
white point is around 8000 K which is
far too cold
giving the display a blue tone in fact
there really doesn't appear to be any
calibration here whatsoever at least not
to the srgb standard as Delta II
averages across the board are above 4.0
normally for gaming laptops I don't find
calibration to be a big issue with the
Alienware M 15 it's a little different
Delta is are above 4.0 and that's
higher than many other laptops
particularly the 5.7 grayscale Delta
average so this display is particularly
poorly calibrated and on top of this
many competitors to this very type of
system especially the msi gs70 by Tara
15 do come with factory calibrated
displays so while it may not bother
every buyer calibration is something you
don't get here that other laptops will
provide overall I'm in two places with
the Alienware m15 on the one hand this
is clearly their best laptop design it's
thinner and lighter than regular
Alienware laptops and that's a step in
the right direction particularly as many
other gaming laptop companies have this
sort of system on the market I've never
been a huge fan of the chunky Alienware
beasts from a design perspective but
this focus on portability here is
welcomed on the other hand I feel
Alienware has failed to execute in terms
of some of the performance
characteristics in particular the cooler
simply isn't powerful enough to cool
both the core i7 8750 h and RT X 28
Emacs q with that throttling there's an
airflow issue here that chokes the CPU
causing lower than expected performance
when both the CPU and GPU are utilized
like in games this is very disappointing
because you don't get these problems
with competing gigabyte or
MSI laptops in fact in both cases the
Alienware m15 is a larger and heavier
overall than the Aero 15 or GS 65
stealth while having less cooling
capacity performance isn't terrible is
still around the mark of a typical RT X
2080 mxq laptop it's just that it could
have been better especially as this
laptop includes the 90 watt variant of
the GPU for future revisions of this
laptop the cooling layer and ventilation
definitely need to be fixed then there's
just a range of other odds and ends that
aren't as polished as competing
offerings the display isn't calibrated
and doesn't pack a slim bezel design and
the default option to get a small 60
watt hour battery means that you don't
get great battery life and you have to
pay to get a larger battery I just don't
see what the Alienware m15 does better
than a laptop like the msi ge62 5
there's no key feature here that might
get me to recommend it in some
situations like say a super affordable
price or a unique design or top tier
before
in every metric I've tested the system
is beaten by the excellent MSI option
which is basically the same price for an
equivalent configuration regardless of
which r-tx GPU you choose and this is
without discussing the overall value
proposition of nvidia streaming laptops
so while the Alienware m15 is a great
step forward for the company it
ultimately doesn't get my recommendation
it's hard to create the perfect portable
system on the first attempt and the guys
at msi gigabyte and others have simply
been doing this for longer and have more
refined better options today that you
should consider instead that's it for
