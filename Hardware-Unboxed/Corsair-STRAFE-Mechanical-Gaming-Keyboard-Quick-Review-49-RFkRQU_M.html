i'm your host Matt and today I've got my
hands on courses new strafe mechanical
gaming keyboard there's been an
explosion of new and exciting keyboards
from Corsair over the past year and the
strafe is their latest weapon there are
actually two versions of the strafe the
standard model known simply as a
strength and the strafe RGB on ham we
have the standard strafe model which
price at 110 dollars makes it around
forty dollars cheaper than the
soon-to-be-released RGB version the RGB
model not only features colorful RGB
backlighting but it comes with a
detachable soft touch wrist rest
something i sorely miss on the standard
model the straight features a similar
design the courses vengeance series
which have become corsair gaming
keyboards but takes a small step back to
basics it still comes with the cherry MX
mechanical keys along with the floating
key design and aluminium body probably
the biggest change on this model has
been made to the keyboards backlighting
rather than fully fledged RGB
backlighting the board only comes with
red LED backlighting not all keys have
to be lit however and various effects
are available corsa offers six standard
effects while you can create and share
more lighting effects through courses CU
ii or corsair utility engine software in
the CU e software users are also able to
assign an adjustment for all of the keys
additionally the keyboard also has a
100-percent anti-ghosting algorithm
built in with 104 k rollover allow me to
press every key on the board without
cause and ghosting issues size-wise the
stray from it is 440 millimeters long
170 millimeters deep and 40 millimeters
thick while it tips the scales of 1.3 5
kilos which I have to say makes it quite
weighty ratchet completely in plastic
you feel surprisingly solid and very
much like a premium product the strafe
is almost the perfect keyboard as far as
I'm concerned the only issue I have with
it's the lack of a wrist rest without a
wrist rest i found the keyboard far so
uncomfortable which me
would have to factor in the cost of a
separate wrist rest decent options
appear only costs between ten to fifteen
dollars at which point amaze well by the
strafe RGB and be done with it now as I
mentioned with no rest rest i found
typing and gaming forced rave quite
difficult since i don't have a
stand-alone wrist rest as an alternative
i took the detachable wrist rest off the
logitech g7 10 plus and place it in
front of the strength this was hardly
ideal but it did make a significant
improvement to how comfortable the
strafe was to use and more importantly
improved accuracy course they also
equipped the stray for the USB
passthrough port which i personally use
quite a lot though there are new audio
options included in the package custom
textured and contoured key caps that
causes says allow for maximum grip and
enhanced field there are two kits
included which is designed for FPS and
MOBA games unfortunately there are any
dedicated multimedia buttons which isn't
a big deal at this price point but might
hurt the $150 RGB version there is a
dedicated windows key lock and a
brightness control button but other than
that layout is fairly standard
underneath the strafe there's virtually
nothing to speak of just for very small
rubber pads for gripping the desk and
two very small feat that only raise the
keyboard up by eight millimeters the
strap is available with either red or
brown cherry MX switches and for testing
we got our hands on the red model in
such a crowded market segment with hope
Corsair will bring more to the table for
example I prefer my three-year-old
logitech g7 10 + mechanical keyboard
which also features Cherry MX brown
switches offers a wrist rest dedicated
media as well as macro keys and it's
backed by a more solid three year
warranty opposed to the two year
warranty Corsair is offering with the
straight overall the Corsair safe is a
very nice looking mechanical keyboard
that feels great and features
exceptional build quality unfortunately
it isn't particularly cheap which makes
a limited feature set a little hard to
ignore thanks for watching another
installment of hardware I'm box i'm your
host Matt let me know if the straight is
a keyboard you're considering in the
comments hit like hit subscribe and I'll
see you next time
