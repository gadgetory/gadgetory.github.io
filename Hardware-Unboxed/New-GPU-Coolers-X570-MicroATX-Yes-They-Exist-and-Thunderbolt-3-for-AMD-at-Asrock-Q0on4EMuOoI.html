making it possible for hardware box to
attend Computex 2019 please check out
their latest gaming and create a desktop
range powered by Intel Core ninth gen
processes via the link in the
description also a thank you to Corsair
for their support check out their new
products again via links below welcome
back to hardware box we're here at the
azrog booth at Computex 2019 they've got
of course their whole new range of AMD
x5 70 motherboards so we're going to
take a look at including what I believe
is one of the only micro ATX x5 70
motherboards on show so that is very
exciting we'll be checking that out as
well as some concept VGA cards which
look pretty likely that they're going to
be used for some Navi GPUs so let's get
to it
alright let's take a look at all of
these as rock x5 70 motherboards or at
least the most interesting with the
bunch unfortunately you guys looking on
the asrock website right now will only
see two X 570 boards the Taichi and the
Phantom gaming X but asrock did have
several others on show that will be
released alongside rise in 3000 the
top-end board and I'm kind of
discounting the aqua here because that's
an extreme enthusiast product is of
course the x5 70 Taichi as expected 12
plus two-phase vrm on this board and the
other top-end
x5 70 boards and from what I understand
that is using a doubler design with 50
amp dr. Moore's power stages although I
don't have the controller specs PCIe 4.0
of course Wi-Fi 6 active cooling for the
chipset so a bit of a redesign for the
heat sinks and m dot 2 covers but it
still looks ok and there's of course RGB
action as well the x5 70 phantom gaming
X is also a top end board that has the
same VM design as the x5 70 tie tree and
in fact has a nearly identical feature
set aside from a few differences
visually the one main addition to the
phantom gammy X is as rocks two point
five gigabit wide networking so I guess
that makes it a higher-end board than
the Taichi will be interesting to see
how they're priced we know a lot of you
guys are micro ATX fans so it's good to
finally see an EM ATX board with X 570
at Computex as rocks X 570 m pro 4 is
meteor in its specs with an 8 + 2
Fay's vrm design and a step down in
component from the big boys still of
course has active cooling for the
chipset and an MDOT - heat spreader ddr4
4400 supports so one step down from ddr4
4666 that you get with the tight sheet
and phantom gaming X of course it
doesn't have as many features as the
bigger boards which you might expect
given the size but it should still be
pretty capable for rise in 3,000 CPUs
especially given it still has an eight
phase-- vrm design although we'll have
to see how that cooling stacks up
another board that might interest you is
the X 570 phantom gaming ITX TB 3 which
steps down the vrm to a 6 + 2 phase
design again not sure on the components
used here the big inclusion here is
Thunderbolt 3 this is the only X 570
board of this form factor we've seen
that has Thunderbolt 3 support so that's
really cool for those that want to make
a super compact system with high speed
device connectivity it also uses an
Intel LGA mount for the cooler because
the standard m4 mount is too large and
prevents Azeroth from doing as much with
the board's Mini ITX form factor as it
can with this design the other asrock
boards with Thunderbolt 3 are the X 570
creator and X 570 aqua the X 570 Creator
is another high-end board although
rather than targeting gamers it's
targeting creators as the name suggests
with features like two Thunderbolt 3
ports up to ddr4 4666 support and a
quantity at 10 Gigabit LAN plus Wi-Fi 6
and an additional Intel Gigabit LAN it
also includes 10 USB 3.2 Gen 1 ports as
well then for the Aqua we here this is a
$1,000 motherboard so we'll be pretty
niche and for specialist open-loop water
cooling builds it's also a limited
edition design so only 999 are being
made but boy does it look awesome with a
full water block coverage for the CPU
vrm and the x5 70 chipset the vrm design
again sounds the same as as rocks are
the high-end design so a 12 plus 2 phase
with 50 amp stages but unclear on the
components once again and yet all the
top-end connectivity features like you'd
want from such an expensive board as
rocker also bringing out several other X
570 boards that unfortunately I don't
have a lot of details on we have the x5
70 phantom gaming 4 X 570 extreme 4 X 5
70 pro 4 and
five seventy steel legend which I
believer all the sorts of mid-range to
entry-level X 570 motherboards that will
fill out the rest of as rocks lineup
I'd expect most of these will use either
eight plus two or six plus two phase V
RMS depending on the price point don't
have pricing on these either although we
did hear that because of the X 570
chipsets price X 570 boards in general
won't be super cheap aside from the
motherboards asrock will also showing
off three VG a concept cards which will
almost certainly become their designs
for upcoming na'vi GPUs asrock only make
AMD graphics cards and the vague line is
finalized so it's not hard to see why
they've made these new designs and where
they'll be used two of the variants
before the phantom gaming line and the
other was a Taichi model all are pretty
beefy occupying at least two and a half
if not three slots and all come with
three fans we're looking at plenty of
RGB effects including illuminated fans
logos and back plates depending on the
model at hand so yeah pretty obvious
these will be used for Navi GPUs given
there are high-end cools designed for
more powerful cars and I've worked with
before asrock does sell Vega and Radeon
seven models but all the simple
reference designs while the rx 590 and
below used their custom dual fan coolers
these new designs look pretty good so
hopefully there will be well suited to
AMD's next generation products alright
well that's it for the asrock booth at
Computex 2019 hope you guys enjoyed the
close-up look at some of the amvx 570
stuff that they've got on show here yeah
hopefully Steve will be getting some of
these products into review over you know
over the next couple of months when all
the rise in 3000 stuff next 570 comes
out so I'll put that job on him to test
all that vrm stuff like he loves to do
as always you can subscribe for the rest
of our Computex 2019 coverage give this
video a like if you liked it subscribe
to all that stuff I'll catch you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
