for today's video we'll be looking at
the performance of Nvidia's GeForce GTX
1080 graphics card or more specifically
how memory frequency impacts performance
actually the card will be using for
testing will be gigabytes really heavy
Extreme Edition card now when these
cards were first announced or this GPU
rather was first announced many were
concerned that the GPU would be limited
by the use of gddr5 X memory rather than
HP m memory also compounding the issue
is the fact that we were only seeing a
sort of mid-range if you will 256-bit
memory bus being used but once the cards
landed they pretty much delivered
mind-blowing performance in the latest
games and yet many have still been
suggesting that their memory bandwidth
limited the concern seemed reasonable
enough after all the previous generation
gtx 980ti sported a 384 bit wide memory
bus and when coupled with 7 gigabits per
second gddr5 memory that resulted in a
peak bandwidth of 336 gigabytes per
second the GTX 1080 on the other hand is
limited to a bandwidth of 320 gigabytes
per second despite using faster gddr5 X
memory and the reason for this being
that it uses a narrower 256-bit wide
memory bus given that the gtx 1080
boasts vastly superior shader power to
that of the 980ti you have to wonder how
a reduction in memory bandwidth might
impact performance and this is why many
were suggesting a memory bottleneck
could be an issue
those figures alone would suggest that
it very much is however there are a few
tricks in videos latest Pascal
architecture has up its sleeve being the
more refined architecture Pascal boasts
a number of improvements over Maxwell
that helps with memory bandwidth for
starters each SM unit features half as
many cuda cores and this is important
because each cluster still has the same
64 kilobytes of shared memory
essentially this means each core has 50%
more memory at its disposal you'll also
find a larger level 1 cache along with a
much larger level 2 cache then as I'm
sure many of you know as we did touch on
it in our launch date coverage Pascal
features a more advanced
ansed color compression algorithm which
helps reduce memory bandwidth demands
even further then getting back to the
gtx 980ti
that particular GPU wasn't memory
bandwidth limited at all in fact down
clocking the memory frequency showed
that it has balance to spare and of
course after all
nvidia isn't going to waste money
developing a complex GPU only to hinder
its performance with a memory bandwidth
bottleneck so you can safely assume that
the GTX 1080 isn't memory bandwidth
starved but we thought why not take a
look anyway it's also worth keeping in
mind that although nvidia spec sees the
1080p with gddr5 X memory capable of 10
gigabits per second it has been proven
time and time again that this same
memory has no issue providing a
throughput of 11 gigabits per second and
some cards even reach 12 gigabits per
second so it's fair to say that the
memory has been clocked a very
conservatively had the 1080 required
more bandwidth you can bet Nvidia would
have pushed the memory harder increasing
the gddr5 X memory transfer speed to 11
gigabits per second increases the 10
eighties bandwidth by 10% to 352
gigabytes per second and that's a decent
boost anyway for a fun little test I've
taken the gigabyte GT x 1080 extra
motion graphics card which comes with
the core overclocked by almost 10% out
of the box the memory has also been
factory overclocked slightly above the
Nvidia reference specification but
that's not an issue for this test as
we've manually set the memory frequency
for each test for testing our
overclocked core i7 6700k test machine
has been used and as always the latest
display drivers available at time of
testing have been used I figured it best
to check out performance and not just
for okay but also the 1440p resolution
in total just three games have been used
for testing but they are newly released
in very demanding titles so they paint a
pretty clear picture with that let's
jump to the benchmarks first let's see
how the gtx 1080 memory scales in Gears
of War 4 out of the box the gigabyte
extremely Asian card was good for an
average of 99 FPS with a minimum of 82
FPS at 1440p reducing the memory
throughput by 8% drop the average frame
rate by just 2% and the minimum by even
less overclocking the memory boosted the
average frame rate by 2% and the minimum
by almost 4% that's not bad that we
found exceeding 11 point 2 gigabits per
second didn't improve
further increasing the resolution of 4k
we average 49 fps at the stock memory
speed with a minimum of 41 fps reducing
the memory bandwidth by 8% so a 4%
reduction in performance or 5% if we
looked at a minimum frame rate
increasing the bandwidth by 12% to 11
point 2 gigabits per second didn't
improve the average frame rate and an
early boost of the minimum by a single
frame Deus Ex mankind divided has some
slightly different results for us out of
the box the gigabyte Extreme Edition
card was good for 62 FPS on average with
a 52 FPS minimum overclocking the memory
fair had absolutely no impact on
anything a bit like a fanboy arguing in
the comment section however when we take
a bit of wind out of the 1080 sales by
reducing the memory throughput to 9.2
gigabits per second the performance
drops by 8% for the average and 10% for
the minimum this does suggest that the
1080 is right on the limit in terms of
bandwidth even at 4k we see no extra
performance gained when overclocking the
memory the same 32 FPS on average is
rendered however reducing the memory
throughput by 8% impacted performance
quite heavily here the average frame
rate dropped by 6% and the minimum by
11% interestingly the performance he was
even greater than the reduction in
bandwidth as it seems the memory
bottleneck really hurts efficiency like
mankind divided we found that there is
absolutely no performance gains to be
had when I book locking the gddr5 X
memory further at least without also
overclocking the CUDA cores the same 107
FPS average can be seen when running the
memory at ten eleven point two and
eleven point eight gigabits per second
the minimum frame rate did jump up by a
single frame but that's almost not worth
talking about what is worth mentioning
is the 5% reduction in performance
seeing when under clocking the memory
granted it isn't that significant but we
do find a tipping point where the GTX
1080 becomes bandwidth limited even at
4k we see no more than a single extra
frame being rendered with the memory of
a clock under clocking the memory
reduces performance by 5% on average and
this isn't a significant drop-off but it
does prove that even a factory
overclocked GT X 1080 graphics card such
as the Extreme Edition version we used
is pretty much getting the most out of
the GPU with the stock gddr5 X memory
well there you have it I did originally
intend to show you guys some
side-by-side gameplay footage but with
just a few frames the difference it
didn't really make for an exciting
compare
for those of you wondering why I didn't
wander the gddr5 X memory speed down
even lower the reason for that being
this was the lowest frequency that MSI's
afterburner software would allow it may
have been possible to create a custom
BIOS to go over the lower or do
something along those lines but for now
I think the 9.2 gigabits per second data
confirms what we set out to find even
when running a heavily factory
overclocked GTX 1080
such as the extreme gaming model that I
used the standard gddr5 X memory
specification is ample for the most part
under clocking the memory by 8% resulted
in a performance loss for all three
games tested for the most part around 5%
of the original performance was dropped
though at times we did see up to an 11
percent drop in short it looks as though
the GTX 1080 is right on the edge when
it comes to memory bandwidth lowering
the memory frequency just a bit you do
start to see the performance fall away
going the other way though unless you've
overclocked the cuda cores
increasing the bandwidth or rather the
memory frequency won't result in any
other performance
this makes the upcoming GTX 10 atti
rumor that the card might not even
feature gddr5 X memory quite interesting
personally I believe it will have to
even with the 384 bit wide memory bus of
the Titan XP the 10 ATT I would only
have 20% more bandwidth than the GTX
1080 if it were to use gddr5 at gigabits
per second memory given that the TI
model is meant to offer 30% more
criticals it's going to need a little
extra bandwidth anyway enough
speculation I think I'll just wait for
the 1080 Ti to come knocking on my door
before I read too much further into that
one and hopefully it does so shortly
after Vega hits our test pad anyway I
hope you guys found the testing
interesting I know it wasn't super
in-depth but I think the test results
were fairly conclusive anyway let me
know what you guys think of the testing
and if you have any ideas for similar
kinds of tests let me know
anyway I'm your host Steve thanks for
watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
