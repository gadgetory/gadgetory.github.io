one of what will be a September Q&amp;amp;A as
you can see we have a new desk here so
Tim and I have been busy making this
desk just now and time to film the
curate and we also got what Tim calls
our new executive seat so we've got some
real seats
Tim's given back his grandma the seats
that we have there are some nice new
seats a new table look at that no lens
distortion as people thought was the
case with the old desk that was bowed in
the middle it wasn't it was just really
cheap it was just very sad so he has a
proper desk now it's going to be painted
a proper coat on top that'll be nice and
scratch resistant and then Tim can film
all these b-roll and when I come over to
do our patron live streams which we just
did a patreon livestream for an hour
built the desk and now it's time for the
Q&amp;amp;A anyway enough waffling about the Q&amp;amp;A
we have some great questions to get into
so let's do it okay I believe this was
the most uploaded question so yeah
that's right you know we also going to
be in the title because it'll be a hotly
well it was uploaded so that's probably
all I need to say question is what do
you think about the upcoming rx 680
rumors so I'll let you yeah well I mean
let's be honest we haven't heard
anything have we well we certainly
haven't heard anything official yeah and
if we'd signed any NDA's or whatever we
probably couldn't comment be we haven't
heard anything so I don't know what that
tells you it's supposed to be coming out
notably soonest with the rumors
mid-october and I would have thought if
it was we would have heard something but
maybe we'll hear something tomorrow yeah
who knows sorry I yeah that one we ever
know too much I am probably expecting a
refresh for the RX range so the RX r RX
580 so maybe a similar lot in videos
done at 12 nanometer refresh just to
keep them competitive at the mid-range
because you will get the GTX 2060 not
sure how much since that will make we
were discussing that before and our
patreon live stream but they want to
remain competitive there so I think we
will see probably a 12 nanometer refresh
12 nanometer refresh and then the seven
enemy of stuff
yeah and I would expect the 7 nanometre
stuff is gonna be at least focused on
the high end so yeah whether or not they
also refresh the mid-range will later
but they've been a bit disconnected yeah
with their two different architectures
for high and mid so yeah it meets an
interesting room it sort of came out of
nowhere really it's definitely just a
rumor at this point but yeah like I said
I wouldn't be too surprised but we don't
have any extra information
all right soya asks what does the ti or
Thai some people say either way what
does the TI in 1080 TI slash 20 80 TI
stand for well I believe it stands for
titanium yeah do they Nvidia originally
say that right in the original okay ti
I'm certain its titanium that's what
I've always thought going way back it's
one of those things you don't remember
the origins of when it was first seen
but I'm certain it's titanium which is
why some mostly American guys seem to
say Thai and it's probably correct but
it sounds rubbish yeah sounds better so
that's why we go with ti rather than
Thai I think Wendell Everett level one
text says Thai so that's probably a good
reason to say toy
anyway we don't I got next question how
and when did Steve and Tim mate most
underrated channel on YouTube kept up
the good work love the content well
thank you very much
hmm I don't really know how far back so
we both wrote or we both produced
content for techspot and I've been doing
that for over a decade now you've
probably been doing it for a while as
well about five six years now yeah yeah
yeah I'd be going probably double that
it's quite coincidental really because
everyone from tech spot is all over the
place about a dozen staff members and I
think there's more than about two guys
two or three guys that are in the same
region and as far as I was aware I was
the only Australian and then we had a
guy producing mobile phones laptops and
well this contents really good this is
in-depth I'm enjoying reading this stuff
and I said to the owner of textbook you
know who's this new guy I think it was
about a year after you've been writing
mind you yeah yeah
yeah about a year or two after here
maybe Ryan was quite a long time I said
I know who's this guy oh it's Tim don't
you know Tim I'm like well I can see
that it's Tim it says he's name but why
would I know Tim you saw he's an
Australian as well was he's know each
other so he was yeah to think he's like
you know that little slice that's down
there right knows everyone ah
so I can't even be out reached out to
you where there was an email must have
an email might have been a private text
box yeah it could have actually been
yeah it could have been that and I just
hey you're in Australia we're in
Australia it was like Victoria I said ha
so I was really puzzled to find out that
you have no idea about that yeah Tim was
familiar with my work as well and had no
idea that I was in Australian just
assumed I was probably based in the US
so it was like a year after that I was
having a LAN party I used to do that
back in my twenties and I was having
heap of mates come over there's about a
dozen office playing call of duty I
think it was can't remember was a bit of
fun anyway and I was pretty good and I
said Tim should I come join in you where
in Geelong at the time weren't you yeah
that's right so Tim was quite far away
it was a massive hike for him anyway he
came out and spent the day gaming and he
was good yeah fun times and then it was
about a year after you were doing
YouTube videos for tech support
yeah there was a bit of that and then
you obviously started Hardware on box
and I sort of signed on is that one
another you were founding subscribers I
guess yes right in the hundreds yeah and
then I would see yeah so Tim later knew
about the audio stuff the camera stuff
I'd never done video before so when
we're starting harbour unboxed I got a
few tips from Tim Tim was happy to give
him and then he said when I finished my
engineering degree I'm going to go into
the workforce but I would like to still
play around with phones and laptops I'd
be cool if I could do a video once every
week or two more like yeah
happy to have you on as a guest and yeah
then Matt left the channel
Tim came on full-time and here we are in
the September QA
all right this is yeah this is a pretty
interesting and topical question I think
will the new US tariffs have knock-on
effects for other countries markets so
non economics or politics expert can't
say follow it too closely but it does
appear to be that the whole Trump China
thing is currently causing prices of
some electronics goods to
crease because a lot of those are
manufactured in China there's no import
tariffs to the US for Chinese made goods
something along those lines but I mean I
have no idea
yes question that seems to be causing
some thing I think like graphics card
prices has been raised okay from some
partners that manufacture their cards in
China so question is will that have
knock-on effects for other countries I
wouldn't have thought that it would
unless those countries impose tariffs
you know it that should only be a US
China thing you would think at the same
time a lot of companies based their
pricing up the u.s. prices so if they
raised the u.s. prices that might cause
yeah the price to hike everywhere else
yeah so probably a company by company
thing again here in Australia already
have plenty of Australia tax so be
pretty mean of them to increase that but
you never know yeah building a gaming PC
well we thought it was bad in January of
this year when I did my series in a lot
of ways it hasn't got that much better
overall and has in some ways but anyway
alright question from jazz I know you
can't share much about your I $9.99
hundred K but can you at least say it
runs on jet 370 so what's a Steve well I
did see this question in the community
thread this morning and I didn't know
the answer this morning but as you guys
know I'm not under NDA and I feel like
it's really information you should know
anyway I don't know why until would hide
that okay it's good news you can so the
ninety-nine hundred K will work on any
of the 300 series boards and right now
it is working on a Zed 370 boards so I
updated the bias of the asou sport in my
test system drop the CPU in brewed it up
straight away in a Windows identifies
the CPU and works perfectly fine so you
can use it on your Zen 370 boards I will
be doing a lot of benchmarking with
hopefully a lot of Zed 370 boards to see
how it performs even on the really cheap
ones whether we see some thermal
throttling some vrm throttling yeah and
how that all works out
anyway the good news is if you've got a
nice high-end motherboard like a Zen 370
god block or something like that you can
drop in the eight core 16 thread a core
I 9 processor if you wish all right
these next two question
are quite long so I'm gonna let Tim read
them out and save my voice a bit because
it's killing me
yeah that's what happens when you get
old with all the focus from invidious
surrounding ray-tracing
do you believe that D LS s actually
shows a more promising case for the RT X
cars and that we should be waiting for
real-world benchmarks before making any
future purchase of the series for FC and
Els s could give these cards a genuine
boost in FPS performance so by the time
this Q&amp;amp;A comes out my video on DL SS
should already come out on a channel
hopefully so at the time of filming it's
all actually out but yes the answer that
is not really DSS and ray-tracing both
seem you know like they'll be in a
couple of games and in plenty of games
won't support those features but I think
crucially what we saw with DL SS is that
it doesn't look that much different to
down scaling the resolution using a
resolution slider to around 1800 P so
when you put the two images side-by-side
4k native looks better
DSS looks about the same as 1800 P and
rendering natively at 1800 pairs around
the same performance so as far as I can
tell from the very limited amount of
demos that I mentioned this in that
video
DSS doesn't look like it's all that
impressive I think the technology is
impressive from it takes 1440p up scales
at using black magic but compared to
techniques we can already use and this
is only one technique there's plenty of
others we can't even test right now yeah
it just doesn't seem like DL SS will be
that killer feature furture it would be
great if there was a killer feature but
I don't think ELSS will be that hmm next
question what is your honest opinion
about cheering do you think chewing is a
placeholder GPU architecture between now
and next release for a quick sales grab
to boost market share sing same D cannot
compete for some time do you think is
here to suck in consumers into a GPU
generation we're ray tracing is not
quite there yet considering blur but
yeah Baba DSS is blurry upscale features
doesn't want to be here okay so what's
our opinion cheering I think we pretty
much nailed it in our announcement video
six weeks ago now whenever I was pretty
much the questions - or the answer to
your questions
yes yes yes yes and yeah it's not that
impressive I mean the 1280 eyes well
again we talked about this on the
patreon livestream the 28th ET is very
fast super impressive and you know
whenever I say that people like it's not
though in terms of value it's not in
terms of value but anything that's 30%
faster on average and up to 55 or 50%
faster than the 1080 T is mighty
impressive because well before that the
1080 - I was mighty impressive so it's
it it's breathtaking at 4k and Tim's
been playing with it at 4k with HDR and
says it's just incredible so it's good
in that sense and I suppose because of
that you could justify the 20 82 hours
I've set in various content pieces now
the 20 80 makes absolutely no sense I
don't think it ever will certainly
doesn't right now D D LSS doesn't seem
like it will make it worthwhile yeah
unless it radically changes from what
we've seen so far ray tracing
you know it's don't think so so really
it's been the 20 atti series yeah
and that the 20 80 is a completely
pointless product that doesn't make
sense at the current price $700 us it's
like okay yeah might as well buy it if
you're getting a high-end card the 2070
is gonna be a super super tough sell and
then Tim and I are scratching our heads
as to what they're going to do with like
the 2060 and lower yeah how churring
versions of those make sense yeah I mean
you say any question is it a place on
definitely that's what we said in the
announcement video so I think my
announcement video if we end up being
right which is looking more and more
like we are was hit the nail on the head
with that one that this is bit of a
money grab just sort of lingering
between what they can ultimately end up
doing so they started to do this and
probably twelve months later you'll see
what they yeah really I'm doing I mean
the architecture there's a lot of
interesting new stuff ik is happening
the architecture it's a big change from
Pascal but it's just in the products
that have been announced in the way that
they're priced and everything it's just
not
that good so some guy on the internet
asks best budget GPU for 3840 by 1200
for 120 FPS low-to-medium say so
therefore you by 1200 is that ultra wide
metric so or resolution I should say so
it's yeah not going to be as demanding
as full 4k but if you still want to play
at 120 FPS low to medium series you're
still gonna need something reasonable at
that
well after position depends what the
game is does depend on the games they're
talking fortnight's like just getting
support later medium or shut off the
Tomb Raider any of the case I would I
would say something like a gtx 1070 yeah
that's the exact thing I was gonna say
oh yeah 1070 if the 1070 is not much
more get that overclock at 1080 high
performance but then when we were
looking at the second hand deals last
month's curating like the 1080 was
probably the way to go second hand yeah
so definitely check out all those sort
of deals but certainly you're not gonna
get away with like a 1050 resolution
even on low to medium 1060 like would
possibly work with like your fortnight's
yeah but not yeah not the real amazing
looking Triple A titles okay next
question
do your significant others now hate the
word benchmark my wife doesn't
particularly care yeah no no my
girlfriend doesn't care so yeah it's not
like I think yes well we were talking
about this when we went to get lunch
it's funny being on YouTube you get a
lot more recognition for doing what I've
always done like we'll talk about the
textbook yeah how we met I've been doing
this job for almost 20 years now
admittedly we put a bit more time into
it now than we did originally but even
so 10 years ago we were still doing
hugely in-depth benchmarks but on the
tech sites that just seems to be a bit
different to YouTube yeah so I've always
you know a new games come out and my
wife's like y'all see you in 2 or 3 days
so nothing's really changed this the way
it is yep she's like huh nice break so I
think this users name is crimson
something like that cousin pretty cool
alright how do you think the Australian
parts market will turn out for the
foreseeable future and do you see a
price improvement
for any specific part anytime soon so I
really think the Australian parts market
is too different to any other market yes
it's probably a more of a global
question or yeah I mean app parts are
obviously inflated compared to the just
direct conversion but it's always been
the case with Australia tax and all that
sort of thing so you know anything that
gets more expensive overseas is going to
get more expensive here as for you know
is anything going to become more
affordable I wouldn't have thought so
anything that's you know becoming
affordable is just going to become
affordable yeah I'm a machine cheap used
the the Intel CPU price facts that we've
seen that's a global thing due to a
supply shortage the 9th gen CPUs are
probably going to come in being quite
expensive yeah so you've got Rison which
is decent in terms of price very good in
terms of price but then we've got the
GPUs that I've done that Ram prices have
come down a little bit SSDs are quite
good stuffs all over the place never we
haven't got that perfect those perfect
conditions we have low memory low
graphics cards or relatively low yeah
there's always something that kind of
blows the budget out for the new builds
ok next question do you think your r-tx
samples are hand-picked to be better not
from what we've seen compared to know
well the reviews and testing the partner
cards that I've got whole been in sealed
retail packaging which doesn't mean
they're having me tested but they look
very like all the gold contacts look
that I never touched anything before it
looked brand-new completely mint so yeah
I doubt it and they really have no
reason to because it'd just be a lot of
time and effort on their hand to get a
card that if a reviewer does the right
thing and really really fine-tunes that
they might get 20 more megahertz out of
it it's not worth it they don't really
overclock that well same thing we saw
with Pascal so it's not like a you know
8700 kcp you wear you know my review
sample at 5.30 Hertz but we found that
the average hits five to maybe 5.1 okay
next question here more dx12 support
with ray tracing and then I think
there's a second completely unrelated
part here could it be possible that
Nvidia is power throttling their cards
because there isn't any competition but
once a MIDI release
as their high end GPU they could open
the floodgates in terms of power use so
our first Lancer the ray-tracing part
more dx12 support with great racing I
wouldn't think so I just think that if a
game has dx12 support in it its might
have rate racing a lot of engines that
are built on dx11 I can't say be
upgraded just for ray tracing and of
course rate racing also works with
Vulcan and for the second part
could it be possible in videos power
throttling there cards it does seem like
there are some power limits they could
probably push a bit higher but it seems
like we're pretty close to the sort of
clock speed ceiling as it is so I can't
really I don't think so yeah yeah can't
really see that being a thing okay next
question what is the future of AMD in
graphics I don't think things will
change too much from what we've seen in
the past they'll continue on earth I
feel like they will become much more
competitive again and goes cross they do
but I think they will and they're just
waiting for that 7 nanometer node shrink
that they're going to do on their
workstation their compute products first
and then that'll trickle down when
yields improve to the more affordable
consumer grade stuff intended more for
gaming and I think that is going to be
really really impressive what are you
doing
yeah reckon that's about it ok this
questions from girls so Kangin you know
discordant chat it'll be good
what do you guys thoughts on how much
more incredible-looking the truing cards
are from AI bees than their Pascal and
previous SKUs and do you guys have a
personal favorite looking during card
sorry about that
well the first part of the question do
they look much more incredible I don't
know they do do I know pretty similar I
think they're pretty swell the gigabyte
ones they got rid of the orange
highlights which I suppose that's an
incredible upgrade yeah yeah I mean
there was some really impressive Pascal
cards like the Auris brand cards were
big and beefy and ran well MSI had more
hi and today TI models like remember
those the the gaming x model the
lightning z model the trio the gaming
extra oh so that was a heap of high-end
really nice models and they've just
merged them together with the 20 80 TI
gaming at
Trio so yeah I'm not I'm not sure you'd
have you would have had to give some
examples for that one but I think
they're very much the same and then what
was the other part of the question what
was that personal favorite looking one I
really like that new Oris card that
that's coming out soon I am getting a
sample of that as well I think I'll
begin the 2082 I I think next month
though is when they'll be coming out
yeah I agree that one does look quite
nice so that looks good
the azuz model looks pretty cool the
Batmobile is type looking one that
everyone says that looks good
obviously I loved the MSI gaming extra
oh that was cool still has a couple of
red highlights that I would have liked
to have seen God and that would have
made it just perfect for me but I think
they all look really good never all that
big coolers they seem it all perform
really well even the founders Edition
looks good okay that is going to do it
for part 1 we will have part two with
many more questions on the channel this
time tomorrow but anyway I hope you guys
enjoyed this and it's probably too late
to get any questions in for the next one
but keep an eye out for next month
because we do this do do this once a
month and it's a lot of fun anyway thank
you for watching I'm your host Steve I'm
your host Tim going like that time see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
