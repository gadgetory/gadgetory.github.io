you may recall I recently compared the
new Radio rx 560 head-to-head with in
videos GeForce GTX 1050 in an epic 30
game battle overall performance was very
competitive though the 1050 did come out
just on top and it also used slightly
less power and that made it my preferred
option that said I've got a freezing
monitor or you plan to get one in the
near future the RX 560 would probably be
the smarter choice anyway if you have
$100 u.s. or about a hundred and seventy
Australian to spend should you even
consider one of these new entry-level
graphics cards or should you up for
something a little more worn in of
course the advantage of buying new you
get things such as a warranty and those
certainly come in handy at times and you
do get support for all the latest
features things such as DirectX 12 for
example but what if you could buy 2012
second-in-command Radeon HD 7950 which
was $450 u.s. back in 2012 obviously no
longer sells for nearly that much last
month they were seen selling on eBay for
about $70 u.s. or $100 Aussie of course
pricing has gone up as is the case with
all GPU at the moment thanks to miners I
suppose that's good news for those of
you who hold onto your old graphics card
because you can now sell it for a
handsome profit anyway before too long
pricing will correct and in fact you
might even be able to get a 7950 for a
price previously unheard of
and if that is the case should you
consider the five-year-old GPU or just
get a current generation entry-level GPU
instead that's what I plan to find out
in this video anyway enough about mining
they'll no doubt be plenty of reading
material in the comment section
complaining about it so I don't need to
pour on I've tested the Radeon HD 7950
in 8 games and provided some nice graphs
for you guys to quickly compare the
results to the rx 560 and gtx 1050 and
1050 Ti but before we get to that here
is some gameplay footage of the 7950
playing popular eSports titles such as
overwatch csgo and rocket League while
watching the footage I'll rattle on a
bit about the history of the 7950 and
then we'll get to the graphs so how does
the old HD 7950 compare to the new rx
560 well
7950 years built upon the first
generation GCN architecture while the RX
560 is a 4th gen part it's pretty crazy
to think but you could almost fit 3 rx
560 dies in the same space that a single
7950 die occupies and yet despite that
the 560 only has around 30% fewer
transistors having said all that though
the 7950 does pack a massive 75% more
cores and texture addressing units
however the cause do operate at roughly
a 60% greater frequency for the rx 560
still when it comes to the memory
subsystem the 1750 has a massive
advantage here thanks to a really beefy
384 bit wide memory bus enabling a
bandwidth of 240 gigabytes per second
that's more than twice that of the 560 I
should also note that two years after
its release the 7950 was rebranded as
the Radeon r9 280 and sold for 250
dollars u.s. the core was slightly
overclocked but essentially performance
remain much the same so the numbers
you're about to see will also reflect
what the r9 280 is capable of anyway on
paper at least the 7950 looks as though
it will be able to take the current
generation entry level parts the
cleaners of course real-world gaming
performance often tells a different
story when it comes to comparing new and
old hardware so let's go see how they
stack up on our risin 5 1400 test system
with 8 gigabytes of ddr4 2666 memory the
Radeon HD 7950 gets off to a reasonable
start beating out both the rx 560 and
gtx 1050 and Mass Effect Andromeda at
1080p using the medium quality preset
here we see an average of 58 FPS which
is plenty for smooth gameplay so good
result let's move on to see how
battlefield one plays please note this
game was tested using the ultra quality
preset and I have to admit this is a
little too taxing on performance
ideally gamers will want to run with the
high or medium quality settings as a
result we do see the 7950 struggling
here and despite the many calls and
superior bandwidth it does fall behind
the GTX 1050 and rx 560 so these results
are unexpected given what we've seen so
far testing with Resident Evil 7 the
7950 played very well spitting out 72
FPS on average making it not just fast
in the RX 560 and gtx 1050 but also the
1050 Ti
so a very solid result for the old 7950
here moving the dirt for I was quite
surprised to see a minimum of 53 FPS for
the 1750 as the game played very well of
course 53 FPS is still very high for
this kind of game but with such a
massive disparity between the 1% minimum
and average framerate you might expect
noticeable stuttering now and then
anyway the game played very well
that said the 1750 was still slower than
the rx 560 the numbers in Ferrara or
more or less what we're expecting to see
the 7950 edged ahead of the RX 564 the
average framerate though the minimum was
a little on the low side anyway both
were a good bit slower than the GTX 1050
in this title for honor is a game that
plays well on most PC hardware little
praised again that plays exceptionally
well even on low-end or dated hardware
as we can see here the 7950 turned out
an impressive 59 FPS on average and
although that made it quite a bit slower
than the GTX 1050 performance was still
excellent performance was also excellent
and Dawn of War 4 and here we see the
7950 taking out both the rx 560 and GT x
1050 graphics cards with an impressive
55 FPS in fact it wasn't much slower
than the GTX 1050 Ti so a great result
for the 5 year old GPU here the last
game I'm going to look at is Tom
Clancy's Ghost Recon wildlands and this
is a seriously demanding title so I've
been forced to use the lowest possible
quality preset even with the low quality
settings in place the 7950 was good for
just 49 fps though the 39 FPS minimum
was quite good still even so the 7950
doesn't look to be that well optimized
for this title capping things off we
have the power consumption figures I'm
actually surprised with how well the
7950 does here obviously it's operating
at a much lower clock speed when
compared to the rx 560 and GTX 1050 but
with significantly more cores on the 28
nanometer process the results aren't
that bad total system consumption peaked
at just 197 watts and that's only 15%
more than the rx 560 the 7950 certainly
isn't a power peak as I sort of expected
it to be at least in relation to these
current generation entry-level GPUs so
it appears as though the old Radeon HD
7950 is actually very close to the rx
560 and GTX 1050
when it comes to modern gaming
performance that said though the results
were a bit mixed so what does an
eight-game average look like let's go
find out well there you have it
overall the 1715 rx 560 do deliver a
similar experience now of course as I
just said the results will vary
depending on the game I'd say it's a
lack of driver optimization for some of
the newer titles
that's probably holding the 7950 back
ever so slightly but given it is a
five-year-old GPU now and it is based on
the first-generation GCN architecture
you can hardly blame AMD for not fully
optimizing for this older GPU having
said that though the performance was
smooth and stability was excellent so
given the GPUs advanced stage that was
great to see if I came across a cheap
7950 I wouldn't hesitate this network
for a budget build especially if I was
playing games such as counter-strike or
rocket League for example alright that's
