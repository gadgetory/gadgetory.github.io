giving Razer a second chance the last
time I reviewed one of their high-end
gaming laptops which I believe was the
Razer Blade from mid 2018 the laptop was
slower than expected given the
components inside thanks to a power
limit on the CPU in particular plus it
ran hot and loud and on top of all of
that it was really expensive which just
made it difficult to recommend but it's
2019 now and with new components from
both Intel and NVIDIA I thought it was
time to see if a new Razer design could
improve upon the flaws of the previous
generation now I'm not looking at the
direct successor to the Razer Blade
instead I've stepped up a size bracket
and today's review is focused on the new
Razer Blade Pro 17 with Intel Knights
gen CPUs and RT X graphics so let's do a
quick spec rundown first the CPU in all
blade pro 17 models is the new six core
Core i7 97 58 which I've tested
previously the GPU is one of three
options the r-tx 2060 r-tx 2070 max Q or
RT X 20 a.m. XQ depending on how much
you want to spend my unit came with the
mid-tier 27 t option and then for ram we
have 16 gigabytes of dual-channel ddr2
of gigabytes of PCIe storage as standard
both upgradable plus a 17.3 inch 1080p
144 Hertz display pricing is still quite
expensive the base model with the r-tx
2060 starts at 2500 US dollars
then increases to 2800 and $3,200 if you
want the 2017 max Q or 2080 max Q
respectively I'll talk more about value
at the end one of the big reasons you'd
buy a razor laptop is the design the
blade pro 17 for 2019 is as sleek and
well crafted as ever with a fantastic
metal unibody encompassing the base and
lid
the minimalist all-black design is a
huge fingerprint magnet but I still
think it stands alone at the top as the
best slim and light performance laptop
design at least from a visual standpoint
it seriously looks amazing and is built
from premium materials that match its
price tag these days razor isn't as
laser focused on size as they once were
at
they've recognized that to achieve what
they want to achieve they really can't
be the outright slimmest or lightest
gaming notebook the blade Pro 17 isn't
massive by any stretch but it is 2.7
kilograms heavy which is average by
modern standards although it's 20
millimeter thick chassis is certainly
still impressive as for functionality
while I do appreciate the refreshed
hinge design which is sturdy strong and
smooth there are slim bezels around the
display but the webcam is still located
above it and it supports Windows hello
which I always appreciate for ports
we're getting 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet which
is a nice inclusion and not common among
gaming laptops plus 3 USB 3.2 gen to
type-a ports I found about 3 port
another USB 3.1 gen2 type-c port HDMI
2.0 P and an SD card reader the keyboard
look I'm not a huge fan of it the travel
distance isn't great and the overall
tactile feel is a bit weak plus the
layout just feels cramped the spacebar
for example is truncated as is left
control mostly to fit in the arrow keys
I like the perky RGB backlighting but I
don't think I'd want to do any sort of
extensive typing on this sort of laptop
keyboard obviously a key mission here is
the lack of a numpad most 17 inch
laptops do come with a numpad especially
in this class although Razer has instead
dedicated that space to large speakers
on either side of the keyboard the
speaker's a decent Pro laptop probably
won't blow you away but I'm sure some
people would have preferred the numpad
that said the massive trackpad is
excellent one of the best available in
current laptops all right let's talk
performance here and first up I just
want to make mention of the different
performance options Razer operas through
their sign apps software the default
mode is bounced which actually keeps the
CPU in a down configured TDP state of 35
watts compared to the standard 45 watts
for the i7 9750 H while the CPU reports
the pl-1 and PL 2 limits as 60 watts and
80 watts respectively in practice this
mode is limited to appeal 1 of 35 watts
and PL 2 of 45 watts as for the GPU it's
kept to stock r-tx between 70 max-q
clocks in its 90 watt configuration so
it's clocked a little higher by default
compared to regular artx to a 70 max
cues and boy Nvidia did a number on
naming for these parts in this bounce
mode you have the option between auto
and manual fan speeds really didn't see
much difference here in terms of
performance if you do choose to limit
the fan speeds to reduce noise levels
GPU clocks do drop slightly through GPU
boost that's the only real change you
can make with the fair slider the other
option you have is a custom performance
mode which gives you an option of either
low medium or high for the CPU and GPU
medium is the default option so if you
put it up too high this is where things
start to get interesting the CPUs power
limit increases significantly to around
a 54 watt pl-1 and 75 watt pl2 so that's
in line with other i7 9750 edge gaming
systems the GPU in this mode gets a 100
megahertz overclock to both the core and
memory as well where performance junkies
here at hardware box so for testing this
laptop as per our standard practices I
said the Razer Blade pro 17 to its high
performance mode I honestly didn't
notice much of an increase in noise
output with this mode selected the fans
didn't seem to ramp up more than under
the auto fan mode but performance is
significantly higher so I'd recommend it
for all buyers given that I've covered
the core i7 97 58 extensively in a
separate video here I'm only going to
talk about how the blade pro 17 CPU
performs in a summary if you want a full
performance breakdown across a variety
of tasks it's worth checking out that
review the good news is the blade pro 17
in its high performance mode performs
similar to the night-sun 50 edge test
systems I've looked at previously in
fact in general it's just a few percent
slower and that can be attributed to a
slightly higher appeal to limit for the
laptops I used in my initial testing not
a big deal the performance differences
fluctuate depending on the test and
overall it's close to margin of error
type stuff
I'd say the blade pro 17 performs as
expected here compared to our average
core 78758 results the blade pro 17 is
about 6 percent faster so a small step
up in performance over last gen morals
but as performance does vary between
laptops there's no guarantee that this
ninth gen system will provide a
meaningful upgrade over 8th gen for most
people I'd own the side of caution and
suggest that if you are thinking of a
single gen upgrade that you shouldn't
expect an improvement and as always
here's a quick comparison to older quad
core laptop so that use the core i7 7700
HQ with a 6 core i7 nice mph were
looking at over a 50%
- performance in some multi-threaded
tasks and double-digit gains - single
thread performance if this is the
upgrade you're making it's definitely
worthwhile the GPU is where things start
to get really interesting I've been
quite critical of the ITX 370 max-q in
the past in its stock configuration the
2070 max-q is significantly under
clocked compared to the full laptop
variant which itself is under clocked
compared to the desktop card the end
result is that while it carries an RT X
27 T name it's 30% slower than what
desktop game is again and honestly it's
not that much faster than last
generation 1070 max-q systems but the
razor blade Pro 17 is far from your
typical RT X 2017 max-q laptop for
starters it uses the higher clocked 90
watt variant of this GPU by default and
then by setting the GPU to use its high
performance mode it gains an additional
100 megahertz overclock when you add all
these gains together the GPU ends up
with a rated boost clock of 1405
megahertz that's significantly higher
than the 1180 5 megahertz you get with
the standard RT X 2070 max Q and just
shy over the 1440 megahertz
from the full laptop variant of the RT X
2070 we are still 13% lower clocked in a
desktop card but this is a big
improvement over the default artx 2070
max Q of course how is a regular buyer
supposed to know the blade pro 17 comes
with this overclocked wince of Emacs q
well I put most of the blame here on
Nvidia there shouldn't be an 80 watt and
90 watt version of this GPU that
delivers different levels of performance
but have the same name but I also think
razer should advertise the variant and
clock speed they are using because
otherwise people might think their
system is a lot slower than it really is
anyway in terms of actual performance
numbers the blade pro 17 is impressive
it delivers on average the same
performance as the full r-tx 2070 laptop
variants so despite carrying max Q
branding this system in its best
configuration
delivers performance that isn't
throttled restricted or under clocked
juda max Q that's a massive positive for
buyers who might be nervous about
getting lower performance from this max
Q laptop versus full RT X 2070 systems
to illustrate just how large this
difference is between the default RT X
370 mm
excu and the blade pro 17s overclocked
2070 max-q 91 he's the performance
breakdown showing a 20% advantage 20%
for two gps with the same name not a
great situation for people who need to
choose between different laptops but
good news for buyers of this laptop it's
a lot faster than you might expect I'm
not sure how the r-tx 20 or 60 is
configured in the blade pro 17
specifically but compared to previous
laptops I've tested with this GPU the
are text when 70 max Q 91 OC is around
26% faster on average that's in line
with the difference between the 2060 and
2070 laptop variants because of course
this razor laptop dev is basically the
same performance as the 2070 laptop GPU
we're also looking at 10% better
performance than the default r-tx 20 80
max q yep that's right
this our text where 70 max q actually
outperforms a GPU that has a higher
product name and should perform better
when you look at raw performance the
blade pro 17 is GPU configuration
delivers around 6.47 teraflops compared
to 6.45 teraflops for the default 228
max Q so the units I've tested have
underperformed a little competitor where
there should be but a great showing for
the blade nonetheless as for the 90 watt
variant of the 20 80 max q still 6%
faster again the laptop I tested with
that GP you might have underperformed
but it's still highly impressive result
for razor if you're coming from a
standard gtx 1070 max Q laptop you can
expect 36% better performance on average
or from a standard GTX 1060 laptop
you're looking at a huge 61% performance
gain those are big improvements and
would be worth while upgrades depending
on how old your current system is I was
pleasantly surprised with the thermal
performance of this laptop the razor
blade I looked out last year ran pretty
hot given it used in the under clock CPU
and just a gtx 1070 max q reaching 81
degrees on the GPU while gaming and 88
degrees on the cpu the blade pro 17 is
not only faster but cooler the GPU sits
at a much more manageable 71 degrees
which is one of the best results i've
seen from this generation of laptops CPU
temperatures are average at 86 degrees
unfortunately the blade pro 17 is still
loud under operations I wouldn't say
it's louder than other laptops that
deliver similar cooling
performance is around the same mark but
it's still not a quiet system for gaming
and the high-pitched cooler whine does
get annoying
I guess when positive here is that the
loud cooler delivers cool components
unlike some previous designs which were
both loud and around hot which often led
to throttling I'm pleased to report that
there was no throttling whatsoever with
this new laptop design what I'd really
like to see he is better access to fan
profile tuning through Razer synapse
which could harness some of the
available thermal Headroom in this
design depending on the conditions when
you set the CPU and GPU to run in the
best-performing mode you lose access to
the fan control so you can't simply tune
down the fan speeds at the top end and
run the GPU at say 80 degrees and serve
71 degrees a lot of laptops have this
functionality but with the blade Pro if
you want the best performance you'll
have no choice but to put up with loud
fans ideally we'd have a better way to
harness the thermal Headroom at least
with decent component temperatures the
surface of the laptop doesn't get
outrageously hot in key areas like prior
designs
alright let's quickly round this one out
with a few other performance notes the
SSD provided is a samsung PM 9 81 512
gigabyte model which performs well and
there's an additional MDOT 2 slot
internally for further upgrades if
required the display is the 17.3 inch
1080p 144 hertz IPS panel this is a
better than usual quality panel with a
contrast ratio of over 1400 to one and
color performance in the 2.0 to 2.5
Delta II range out of the box which is
acceptable gamers I think will really
appreciate the top-end refresh rate
which is well suited to the hardware
inside and finally we have battery life
a video playback score of around 5 hours
in our typical test is mediocre it's not
a fantastic result for this sort of
laptop but again it is similar to other
gaming laptops with this sort of
hardware so all up I'm impressed with
what the Razer Blade pro 17 brings from
a technical standpoint performance when
set in the appropriate mode is better
than advertised especially for the GPU
which despite receiving max-q branding
performs identically to the fully
fledged laptop RTX 2070 namely confusion
aside buyers should be really happy with
how this laptop performs in productivity
and gaming workloads performance isn't
the only technical hurdle Razer has
resolved compared to the last time I
reviewed a race at gaming laptop dermals
are improved
although the laptop is still loud and
I'd like to see more user control over
fan speeds to make better use of the
better cooler design the design is as
excellent as ever
2.5 Gigabit Ethernet is a nice touch and
the 1080p 144 Hertz display is great my
only real nitpick here is the keyboard
which is a tad mediocre in terms of
value there's kind of two perspectives
here as far as well-built slim and light
gaming notebooks go I actually don't
think the Razer Blade pro 17 is
ridiculously expensive at twenty eight
hundred dollars for the model I reviewed
it's only $100 more than the similar msi
gs70 five stealth with the r-tx twenty
eighty max q while we are comparing r-tx
between 70 max QR text 20 80 max Q I've
tested both laptops and the blade is 7%
faster despite having the lower GPU
which is enough to justify the higher
price tag and given this razor laptop
basically sits in the RT X 28 Emacs q
performance category or better where
most equivalent offerings are at least
2500 US dollars
I think the blade probe puts up a strong
showing given its design performance and
feature set it will come down to what
you want and yes it is still expensive
but I don't think it's anywhere near as
outrageous as previous rows of laptops
that I've slammed for poor value on the
other hand to justify this sort of
purchase you'll have to be really keen
on the design and portability advantages
of this classic notebook you can't get
full RTX 2070 laptops with near
identical performance to the play pro 17
for under $2000 these days sure they'll
be thicker heavier systems in general
with more basic designs but if you're
just after performance than they are a
better option that's it for this review
