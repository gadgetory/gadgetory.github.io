with Matt so hi Matt yup well done
still we go and we are about to build
Matt's new computer
so we've from the previous episode we
tested with it just on the bench and got
some temperatures they're all quite good
we're going to stick it in the case now
retest it and see what we end up with so
time to get building
I'll put the film face on yeah go for it
is that what are you doing oh if the
people is a comment section see that
Matt why not do it again where's the
cloth I can't believe you doing yeah I
know you'll be happy that's the wrong
that's the wrong method as well you
serious
haven't you you did this for like a year
these bills how do you not know the
correct method for thermal post try
again is it you start here right no no
no no no wrong ah I'll do it I'll do it
give me the thermal paste yeah that's
how it's done see the difference between
how you were doing it I mean I did it
let me try
so just like this no that's still not
right it's it's going to be just right a
perfect amount you're ready wash yeah
okay I can't see what you did there yeah
you got it that's one and make sure I
can do it alright we'll go with that I'm
gonna have to settle
alright so the instructions we were
given by vet Phoenix was to top mount
the 240 millimeter radiator which will
work well for extracting the heat from
the CPU unfortunately we can't do that
because it very clearly hits the top of
the motherboard the vom heatsink doesn't
even come close to fitting so that's not
going to be an option we're going to
have to front mount the radiator which
means we'll be pushing any hot air
generated by it into the case which
isn't really ideal and we prefer to
exhaust that at the top the only other
option would be to sit the fans
externally on top of the case and that
would have to be pulling through the
radiator so anyway we have to relocate
that and sort of change the plans we
were going with
okay so that's where we're at we have
many fans in the front the top the back
and as a result those are fan headers
and RGB connectors that Matt's going to
deal with and make really neat in
probably the next hour or two yeah
all right so when you record Matt
looking all right so far I'm pretty
pretty black-and-white isn't it
yep Matt's pretty happy with the black
and white thing we've got going on here
it wasn't planned it just seemed to
happen that way anyway we've got most of
it put together we're just about ready
to do the initial test fire it up
we've just got to work out a graphics
card do we have the graphics cards
laying around anywhere oh they're right
over the fire desk so the plan initially
was to install a gtx 1070 TI why not
overclock that 1080 light performance
pretty good bang for your buck that was
what we were thinking of going with but
I'm no longer feeling that generous
because graphics card pricing is crazy
at the moment not sure Matt deserves a
1080 Ti I'm gonna take a poll on that
one I'm guys at affordable alternative
right now and not even sure of
alternative to a GTX Everett is the
right word to use but an affordable
graphics Cal at the moment is the RX 560
many leagues different in terms of
gaming performance what Matt really only
plays games like a rocket League and
stuff like that so maybe that is
something you can use to tie yourself
over till graphics card pricing falls in
line so we're gonna try both cards and
see if Matt can play rocket League on
his rx 560 I think I think he can make
do quite comfortably so let me at 725
find out what Matt's opinion is on the
matter in a moment
all right so you can probably hear the
fans they're reasonably loud we haven't
done any fan curves or anything like
that yet we've just powered on it looks
to be working we'll plug an SSD in a
moment see if we can fire it up into
Windows and we'll run some tests with
the front cover off with it on see how
much difference that makes on thermals
of course what the side panels on as
well and yeah we'll run some thermal
tests right now to see how it goes
okay so we're back up and running and
we're about to start stress testing
again we have the ambient air
temperature in the room is caught by a
degree sore at 22 degrees so it
shouldn't impact us too heavily we're
currently idling at 29 degrees with the
overclock so we're gonna let this stress
for an hour of course the front of the
case is off so we have just boatloads of
air flow going through the end zone at
the moment so this is an optimal
scenario for this case once we've done
this test with the front panel off and
record the results we're gonna throw the
front panel on and see how we get on
like that ah back soon okay so let's
first get a few things out of the way
for testing we're obviously using a 240
millimeter all-in-one liquid cooler and
a boatload of fans this isn't a review
of the BitFenix Enzo if it were would at
least test the case with an air cooler
on the CPU and a stock fan configuration
I can certainly see how this case would
suffer with just a single 120 millimeter
front mounted fan in the middle position
there it's almost just moving air around
itself for this kind of limited airflow
design let's say for it to work you
really need three 120 millimeter fans
mounted in the front thankfully though
with the a IO we were forced to do that
anyway of course we've also installed
two 120 millimeter top mounted fans as
well and they really help move air
through the case the Enzo is an $80 US
case at that price it's reasonably good
value given it looks nice and the build
quality solid and it's pretty easy to
work with performance wise it was great
using how configuration which saw three
120 millimeter fans in the front and
three in the rear the fans use were the
BitFenix Spectre Pro RGB LED 120
millimeter case fans and they cost $17
ush so we have 102 dollars worth of fans
in an $80 case this is an extreme
example and we were mostly paying for
the fancy LED lighting effects BitFenix
also sells 120 millimeter case fans for
just six dollars and even without the
fans from the all-in-one liquid cooler
you technically only need an additional
four so you could achieve
similar levels of airflow for an
additional twenty four dollars and that
would take the total bill for the case
to about a hundred dollars which isn't
that bad okay so time for some
temperature testing and this is what
we're faced with stop the results were
most impressive on the bench as seen in
the previous episode the rise in seven
1,700 hit 44 degrees with the vrm temp
of 60 degrees once installed in the Enzo
the CPU load temps increased by just
four degrees and we felt that was a very
reasonable and well great result the vrm
temps though those fell by 10 degrees
and I believe this is largely due to
those two 120-millimeter top mounted
fans then once overclocked we see an
increase of just 5 degrees for the CPU
once installed inside the Enzo granted
with the front panel removed we did see
no change in temperature when compared
to the open test bed so if the case did
offer better airflow the results would
have been comparable to that of our best
case scenario but I suppose that's not
that surprising vrm temps with the front
panel removed they were good for the
gigabyte motherboard anyway though I'd
have to say 97 degrees is still rather
horrible still even with the front panel
installed we still saw better temps when
compared to the open test bed so while
certainly hot out once installed inside
the end so the results are still very
good and not far from our best-case
scenario as a side note if BitFenix
shipped the Enzo with to 120 millimeter
fans in the front then I feel it would
perform much better in its
out-of-the-box configuration right well
I think that went really well what do
you reckon yeah it looks awesome it
builds really clean really like the
colours and coming to start doing some
work with it yeah I agree I'm I'm pretty
surprised by how little difference we
saw with the components installed in
this case especially after I'd heard
that this is quite a hot case so it was
a bit of a toaster a toast a bit it's
yeah really surprising I only saw four
or five degree difference in the room
temperatures gone up a degree or so so
very very surprising I'd like to do
actually a bit more testing with it but
handing it off to you so I don't know no
I'm sure we can do about that fit anyway
hope you guys enjoyed the build series
building Matt's new computer
Matt enjoys his new computer and it all
goes well for him so thanks for watching
and we'll see you again next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
