time to check out AMD's latest offering
for gamers the Radeon seven that'll be
clear this is a compute product that's
been repurposed for gaming as well as
content creation it's based on the
Radeon instinct mi 50 now the Radeon 7
is essentially gimped Vega 20 silicon
though it's not gimped in a way that's
meaningful to gamers also what's not
gimped is today's video sponsor hosting
out if you have to fast web hosting at
an affordable price then look no further
as one of the industry leaders they
offer a wide range of services with a
focus on shared hosting cloud hosting
and VPS hosting setting up and creating
your own website with hosting it isn't
costly or difficult
thanks to their drag-and-drop website
builder that makes it possible to get
your website online in less than an hour
with a professional team of experts
online 24/7 hosting and manages to keep
its support service a class above the
rest but still remains incredibly
affordable for a 15% discount please
check the link in the video description
right so getting back to the Radeon
seven what's all this talk about it
being gimped okay so for starters the
double precision floating point on FP 64
as it's often referred to has been
disabled
reducing throughput from 6.7 teraflops
down to just 1.7 teraflops but again
this will have no impact on gaming
performance AMD has also disabled PCIe
4.0 limiting the Radeon 7 - the more
commonly used pcie 3.0 interface again
for gaming this is really a non-issue
now for those of you unaware AMD did
announce the Radeon 7 GPU at CES just a
month ago now and it wasn't exactly met
with a lot of fanfare everyone was
expecting AMD's new GPU architecture
codenamed navi or at least that's what
most were hoping for
so a repurposed compute project wasn't
exactly what everyone was clamoring up
the walls for and certainly not at $700
us sure this is a new 7 nanometer
gravity's car but unfortunately it's
based on the GC and 5th generation
architecture the same architecture used
by Vega 56 and 64 and well let's be
honest they weren't the most exciting
products unless you
found on sale for a hefty discount the
move from Global Foundries 14 nanometer
process to TSMC 7 nanometre FinFET
process has allowed AMD to shrink the
die size by 32 percent while also
packing 6 percent more transistors now
you could technically say that the
Radeon seven should be called Vega 60 if
you were to go off the previous Radeon
rx Baker series naming though that would
be confusing and silly as it will be
quite a bit faster than Vega 64 still
what we have here is 60 compute units
for a total of 3840 stream processors so
6 percent fewer cores than Vegas 64
however the cores are clocked at least
13% higher and we have some serious
memory upgrades and I'm not just talking
about that insanely unnecessary at least
for gaming 16 gigabyte VM capacity in
addition to having as much memory as
your entire system the radio and seven
also gets a massive 4096 bit wide memory
bus allowing for an insane 1 terabytes
per second of memory bandwidth double
that of Vegas 64 now AMD CEO Lisa sue
has already stated that Radeon 7
performs competitively with NVIDIA
GeForce r-tx 2080 and as such will be
available at the same $700 us asking
price even so it's believed at this high
price aimed he's not actually turning a
profit on these so I guess we're not
gonna see the monster hell anytime soon
anyway that's probably enough chitchat
for now let's get into the important
stuff before delving into the benchmarks
as usual our corsair GPU test rebuilt
inside the crystal 570 X has been used
and it comprises of a core I nine 900k
clocked at five gigahertz with 32
gigabytes of vengence ddr4 30 Turner
memory I've tested a dozen tiles at
1080p 1440p and 4k though for this video
we're only going to focus on the 1440p
numbers but you can get all the 1080p
and 4k data via a link in the video
description before we get into the
benchmarks so we'll just like to note
that while testing the Radeon 7 into
numerous stability issues with the press
drivers supplied by AMD as I pieced this
video together on the day of the release
I'm still we get to receive an update a
driver from AMD
so rather than test 30 plus games I'm
sticking with a dozen titles that
accurately represent how the radio and
seven performs across a wide range of
titles and then when we get an improved
driver I'll go back and test two or
three dozen games I'll talk more about
the current issues I faced with the
press driver but for now let's just get
into the blue bar graphs first up we
have for tonight and I have to say not a
good start for the Radeon seven as it
trails the r-tx 2080 by a massive 20%
margin thankfully though this isn't the
norm as you're about to see still we do
have a good mix of games that I believe
paints a pretty accurate picture of
overall performance this is certainly a
worse case though is the radio and GPU
could only match the r-tx 2070 and it
was just 22 percent faster than Vega 64
it's also a far cry from the now
two-year-old GT X 1080 Ti it's a bit
brutal to be honest but let's move on to
some more promising results all right
this looks much better the Radeon 7 / in
battlefield 5 using the DirectX 11 API
pumping out an impressive 122 fps on
average the one percent low performance
was a little lower than expected but we
do see a similar thing with Vegas 64 and
56 when compared to Vegas 64 we do see a
31 percent boost to the average frame
rate so that is quite nice here we have
another title where Radeon 7
I mean 156 FPS on average and World of
Tanks is ample performance but it also
meant the new radio and GPU was 17%
slower than the r-tx 2080
and only slightly faster than the RT x
2070 so a pretty poor result here over
all that said Vega never really did that
well in this title so the result isn't
entirely surprising Vega 64 only just
beat the gtx 1070 after all a title
where the radeon gpus shred is strange
Brigade though like battlefield 5 we do
see slightly weaker than expected 1% low
performance not terrible and there was
no sign of stuttering but the 1% lows
are still low relative to the GeForce
GPUs still when comparing the average
frame rate the Radeon 7 GP was 10%
faster than the RT X 2080 at this point
you might be starting to sense a bit of
a trend you might be onto what I've done
here basically I'm giving you some bad
news followed by some good news just try
to let you guys down
gently as all you know I really do care
that said it is time for some bad news
monster hunter world sees the Radeon
seven fall behind the r-tx 2080 here it
was 16% slower and just 7% faster than
the RT X 2070 so let's just move along
well they would you look at that some
good news for prospective buyers the 489
7's back on track four shut off the Tomb
Raider though if you were expecting or
at least hoping for an RT x 2080 killer
then these results what exactly send
tingles through your spine
it's a few frames faster on average
while a few frames down for the 1% low
result so basically on par with an ITX
twenty eighty and one of 2018 s best
looking titles moving on we've seen in
the past and in videos cheering
architecture is well suited to Rainbow
six siege and while the radeon gpus once
enjoyed a strong performance advantage
in this title that's really no more here
Radeon 7 struggled to keep pace with the
RT X 2080 and in fact was just a whisker
ahead of the RT X 2017 far cry 5 is a
well optimized tile and also happens to
be sponsored by AMD though that isn't to
say they have an unfair advantage here
they really don't I'd actually say this
is a fairly even playing field and as
such the Radeon 7 and GeForce r-tx 2080
are basically neck-and-neck Forza
horizon 4 is another well optimized
title and while Vega gives the Pascal
base GeForce 10 series GPUs and absolute
pounding the new RT X models don't
suffer the same weakness and we see that
the RT X 2080 was just able to outpace
the new Radeon 7 weather
evil 2 is yet another well optimised
toddle at scales very well across a wide
range of hardware and here the RT X 2018
Radeon 7 very evenly matched along with
the two-year-old GT X 1080 Ti
another $700 GPU I have to admit I
seriously want to drop ARMA 3 from the
testing I've now put my foot down and
deleted GTA 5 I'm done with it no matter
how much noise you guys make it ain't
coming back
please don't make too much noise you
know I'll end up caving anyway ARMA 3's
days really have to be numbered at this
point it's basically a dual-core CPU
benchmark it's going to skew the results
somewhat due to the CPU bottleneck but
given some games our CPU limited it's
not exactly an unrealistic
test condition like some people would
claim because as I said some games are
CPU limited anyway moving on performance
in hitman is pretty even between the gtx
980ti r-tx 2080 and vegas 7 but again
this is another title that's somewhat
CPU limited at 1440p so keep that in
mind well that's all 12 games I think
now it's time to check out some power
consumption for use we all know AMD's at
least a generation behind on video when
it comes to efficiency and well Radeon 7
really does nothing to change that it
was slightly slower than the GTX 1080 on
average and here we see it consumes a
whisker more power honestly that's
pretty depressing given that we're
comparing a two-year old product using
tsmc 16 nanometer process to a brand new
product using tsmc 7 nanometer process
granted the GTX 1080 Ti is a
purpose-built gaming graphics card but
at the end of the day gamers really
don't care about that
they care about performance and how much
that performance costs anyway pretty
disappointing stuff here if I'm honest I
mean the RT X 2080 is 65% larger packs
roughly the same amount of transistors
yet reduced total system consumption by
15% and for total system consumption
that is a significant number moving on
operating temperatures were also pretty
disappointing actually the temperature
alone is okay at least compared to that
of the RT X 2080 found musician the
issue is the fan speed required to allow
these temperatures and I will get to
that in a moment something else worth
mentioning is that I replace the
attached ehm 0-3 carbon fiber pad with
Arctic's MX for thermal paste after
tearing the card down in my unboxing
video just a few days ago out of the box
with an ambient room temperature of 21
degrees the radio and seven hits 74
degrees however when I went back and
retested using the thermal paste that
temperature under the same conditions
dropped in to 69 degrees and the fan
speed were unchanged so that's
interesting not sure if that's normal as
I can't actually go back and retest with
the carbon fiber pad until I get my
hands on another card but if others are
seeing these same kinds of temperature
drops then that is a shame and it means
enthusiasts hoping to overclock will
want to remove the carbon fiber pad and
use a quality film or pay
anyway wrapping up this section of the
review I'll just say the radio and seven
is bloody loud even when running at just
shy of 70 degrees as soon as the card
was placed under any kind of load the
three fans spun up to a vacuum cleaner
like 2900 rpm and it was at this point
that I realized yeah this is an AMD
reference card that makes sense I mean
this card does look beautiful but boy oh
boy
is that hard on the ears and videos
founders Edition graphics cards aren't
exactly quiet either and that's why I
recommend that you don't buy those and
their fans spin at 2,000 rpm but even so
they are significantly quieter than what
we've got here with the radio and seven
okay so we've seen how the radio and
seven performs in a dozen titles we've
taken a look at power consumption and
we've also checked out thermals so it is
time to start wrapping up our day 1
coverage starting with a few performance
breakdowns before we do though please
note I haven't tested with that many
games for this review as I'm not really
that confident with AMD's driver as I
said earlier it's very unstable and I've
confirmed the stability issues with
other reviewers so I know this isn't an
issue it's just limited to my test
system I believe the performance that
I've shown in this video is accurate but
even so I would rather wait for a stable
driver before investing a few days
testing 30-something games
okay so Amy's claimed with the Radeon 7
is on power of the RT X 28 II guess that
statement is true enough and you could
certainly very easily cherry-pick the
games and settings to put them within a
percent of one another
anyway across a fairly random selection
of games our Whitman sampler if you will
the Radeon seven was on average four
percent slower not too bad but it really
only stood out in battlefield 5 and
Strange Brigade performance was similar
and shut off the Tomb Raider far cry 5
resident able to hit men two and a three
then we start to see the Radeon 7 fall
behind in Forza 4 and then well behind
in Rainbow six siege Monster Hunter
world World of Tanks and fortnight so
given that the Radeon 7 comes with the
same $700 US MSRP as the RT X 2080 and
say this is a disappointing result
moreover if you were disappointed that
the GeForce r-tx 2080 was only slightly
faster than the two-year-old gtx 980ti
then you're no doubt disappointed the
radio and seven is slightly slower also
as we saw power consumption isn't
improved in fact it's actually slightly
worse so I'm not sure what more I can
say at this point really so let's just
move on to something that it can be
yeah the RT X 2060 may be way cheaper
but at least the radio and seven was 31
percent faster on average you just have
to close your eyes ignore the fact that
it costs 100 percent more and finally
here we have some real hearty x-lite
gains Vega 64 comes at a $500 u.s. MSRP
making the Radeon 740 percent more
expensive yet it was just 23% faster
crap that's worse than r-tx like the
only saving grace here is that AMD
hasn't tried to sell us on a technology
that won't deliver while effectively
scamming customers with a 1 month long
pre-order period and then having a good
amount of them die in the hands of
gamers so you know there's that got to
look on the bright side guys seriously
I'm not gonna try and sugarcoat it not
that we ever do I guess I'm just over
disappointing GPU releases that and I've
spent a week dealing with random crashes
and system resets while I try to
benchmark this thing anyway here's the
cost per frame data naturally given what
we've just seen it is worst values in
the r-tx 2080 and despite being faster
than Vega 56 and 64 it's actually way
worse value frankly I just turned down a
few quality settings and enjoyed the
almost 25% improvement in value with
Omega 56 actually scrap that I'd
probably just get nasty X 2060 given its
slightly faster and slightly cheaper
then I just happily grin as Radeon 7o
nures tell me 6 gigabytes of vram isn't
enough at this point you might be
wondering where the overclocking
performance is and unfortunately I don't
have anything for you right now aim DS
what man is basically broken at the
moment none of the overclocking features
seem to work and they just made my
already unstable system even more
unstable so this is something I will
have to revisit laid up once it's fixed
I know Tech Jesus Steve from gamers and
XS was also having problems with
overclocking and stability in general so
if he's got a little less hair and he's
radion seven review you'll know why us
state was also very helpful to me as a
MIDI wasn't confirming the stability
issues I was seeing but with tech G's
are suffering the exact same issues I
knew it wasn't a problem on my end of
course I did try multiple different test
systems with numerous fresh installs of
Windows but even so it's good to know
another benchmark Stig saw the same
issues there's also that massive sixteen
gigabyte frame buffer an insane 1
terabytes per second of memory bandwidth
which of course could be beneficial for
content creators and other GPU
accelerated applications but due to the
stability issues I just talked about
testing a dozen games was challenging
enough so the application based
benchmarks will have to wait
I'm sure someone else has dug into that
already though so you should be able to
find something online another issue for
the radio and seven will be availability
the retailer's I've spoken to have all
said availability is much worse than
what they saw with the RT X 20 atti upon
release so while I suspect the demand
for this new radio and GPU will be very
low production still might be even lower
as such I'm not sure if or when we'll
see custom AIB models amy has told me
that AI bees are free to develop their
own models but I suspect very few
actually will we saw this with Vega
there just wasn't enough volume and
demand to warrant the investment from
the board partners in the end radio and
7 looks to be nothing more than a
stopgap to the now heavily delayed Navi
it's a way for aim D to stick their hand
up halfway and say hey guys we're still
here don't forget us the only hope now
though for ad on 7 really is that the
production costs will come down over
time over the coming months and we will
start to see prices well I hope that we
will start to see prices edge down
towards $600 probably a big ask at this
point I know but yeah at $600 it would
be only slightly better value than Vega
64 and the RT X 2080 while it would
still be worse in terms of cost per
frame than the RT x 2070 so in summary
the great graphics card depression
continues and unless you're looking at
spending less than $200 the options
available really are
that great in terms of value Amy also
needs a miracle with Navi has a lot
riding on that one but given what
they've achieved with Verizon I strongly
believe anything's possible at this
point anyway that is going to do it for
this one like if you want to see
competition returned to the GPU market
I'm just kidding like if you liked the
video dislike it as far as if you
disliked it and you can subscribe for
more content also if you appreciate our
honest opinion you can support us
directly via patreon and receive a few
cool perks there and yeah notice going
to do it for this one I'm your host
Steve thanks for watching I'll see you
again next time
you
