for hardware unboxed unboxing boxes
alright so for today's episode
I've just got most of the boxes that
have been laying around the house the
studio cluttering up space I have to get
them opened get them out so this is kind
of like an early let's call it an early
Christmas special because we're just
gonna the last through most of these way
faster than normal hopefully this isn't
a six hour special let's get into it
I think we will start with this big long
box that I have here most on the frame
we'll start with these big long box that
I've got here because I suspect it's
probably something like a gaming chair
because it is massive it's heavy let's
get it out of the way
all right so that's the biggest box
dealt with and we've got the raid max
tracone truck Karen I think it is and it
is a desk chair racing themed desk chair
kind of like the Corsair T one that I
was sitting on only difference is this
only costs $180 u.s. and it's very
similar whereas the Corsair chair on
sales about 300 US throne or $50 u.s.
typically so this is much much cheaper
but I have to say it doesn't really feel
much much cheaper and as you see I've
got the red version but it also comes in
an all black I believe there is all soft
on my head a blue yellow
it's a white one a brown one so that's
kind of cool I think there's green as
well but there's a heap of colors you
can jump over their website it's the
raid max Drac home check it out if
you're after a good quality good it
feels pretty solid the wheels aren't the
wheels actually move much better on my
sort of a plush nap down here good for
their audio and the wheels roll on that
really easily whereas the Corsair chair
has the sort of rollerblade wheels and
it's hopeless on this stuff gets stuck
constantly good adjustment as you saw it
can lay completely flat I won't do that
in here because stuff on my shelves will
go for lying there so a very cool chair
worth checking out if you're after
something it is affordable and it has a
few nice got a good lumbar support
anyway we now have a mountain of boxes
to get through so we're going to tackle
the first at least five really fast
really fast for me anyway got my knife a
blunt knife and let's well I think we
should probably actually will just make
a clearing by opening the boxes put that
one other way well we got here we'll rip
into this ah very good excellent
okay what we have here is a new
Silverstone SFX power supply and it is
the SX 650 G and I believe that is a
there's a gold certified SFX power
supply I'll take a real quickly to that
okay so small SFX power supply so small
that's the form factor it is fully
modular as you can see gold rated 650
watts not sure on the pricing I'll put
that in all video description there'll
be some links for it on Amazon so you
can check that out but Silverstone
Silverstone so why can't I say
Silverstone fast they make really good
sfx power supplies they've got an 800
watt model I believe floating around I
mean a nice big fan and that should work
well that's going in my shift build my
fan Tech's shift
Rison 7 with a Vega GPU that'll be cool
you get some black rubberized cables
lots of those and that's done daddy
scrap next box or plastic bag with some
sort of box shaped thing in it so see
sonic first clue see sonic probably
guessed a power supply good job okay we
have well as luck would have it another
gold rated 650 watt power supply I think
we unboxed one of these on the channel
not that long ago I'll be using this in
a build yeah it's a well-priced good
quality power supply and we're gonna
move on alright next box right at the
bottom
all right we have the new corset ll 120
RGB fans these things look amazing a
really really impressive fans probably
dare I say the best-looking RGB fans on
the market right now I will put these in
that Corsair coffee lake system that I
built recently so if I get time I'll
throw some b-roll up of these bad boys
in this video but there you go
they look really cool so there you go
some corsair fans next let's get this
out of my way shall we alright these are
two products that I actually saw at
Computex I've been keen to get my hands
on them we have they're both the new
Aero cool project seven branded products
so we have the project seven the new
cooler I think it is the p7 L 240 so
that's the new liquid cooler probably
going to test that out of the channel
very soon and we have the p7 it's 650
watt platinum rated power supply I whip
them out quickly have a quick look at
them and then jump into probably this
big yellow box next myself a little bit
more like a circular grill pretty much
on the top and bottom looks pretty
pretty sweet very different that's for
sure the back it looks pretty cool as
well
unique kind of ventilation you've
obviously got the on and off switch 3
pin power input and again fully modular
so I just realized this is the third 650
watt power supply but I've unbox but
already but it's not a gold one this has
platinum so next level and what do we
have in the K okay so we've got black
rubberized cable so nothing too crazy
there but still there they blend in nice
nice and Stella Theo like that
and we got the other side more kaor so
it looks like for a 650 watt power
supply you get a lot of cables all right
well I will feature this in a build on
the channel they're not too distant
future so you'll probably see more of
this power supply so this is the new p7
L 240 all-in-one liquid cooler and we
have a nice big block and pump there so
that's designed for a m4 and your LGA
1151 style stuff probably your X 299
platform as well so yeah probably not
big enough for thread Ripper some nice
fans on it I will probably benchmark
this soon check it out see ugh with the
cooling is so yeah we won't spend too
much time on that there you've seen it
all right next up the yellow box as
promised
are you ready
interesting ok motherboard or box of
bits okay its power okay what we have
here is the new asrock x2 9e ITX / AC so
that would be a mini ITX X Mini ITX X
399 I'm trying to say PCI Express slot
naturally so you can put a high graphics
card in there on this sort of a riser
type card here we have six SATA ports so
to be a busy mini ITX case what else we
got we've got dual gigabit network
wireless AC with bluetooth the chipset
will be all the chip will be under there
platform controller hub so that is a
very busy little motherboard and what I
think I will do with this is I'll put it
in remember that it was last episode I
checked out the fan text shift X case
and that thing was awesome like a really
crazy mini ITX case I think this is
probably the right Mini ITX motherboard
to take advantage of that
you imagine this thing with an 18 core
processor on it yeah that would be
pretty crazy $2,000 us CP not sure why
you'd do it but but make for one a hell
of an editing rig hmm
we also have a bits power block and it
looks like this could be a mono block
for that board that would be very insane
okay yes it is yes it is I was just
thinking I wonder how hot the vrm on
that board would get with a 79 80 XE on
it so the 18 core CPU I was having a
look at the vrm and it doesn't look
massive looks alright looks decent but
with this cooling it as well as the CPU
that could be pretty cool so and it's
designed for the Azeroth board that's
cool so that is definitely going in that
bill so we've got another box you
another bits power box and I'm not sure
what we have in this one oh wow
humph reservoir radiator all in one so
it's like a custom all-in-one or at
least a highly flexible all-in-one so
that is very cool so should be out of
squeeze that in there I was going to do
a hard pipe bill which I suppose I still
could do hard tube well okay so my GB
fans on there while you'll be seeing
this in a built on the channel very soon
I'll just pack all this up neatly and
carefully okay I think we're doing
pretty good here I don't know how long
we've gone to get to this point but
feels a lot faster than what it would
normally be I think we've done more
boxes than a normal unboxing boxes
episode but we'll keep going what do we
got here
Oris ax 370 gaming k7 that's what we
have here now this motherboard isn't new
it is awesome
but it isn't brand new yeah for quite
some time now is of course an AM for
motherboard with the AMD x-37 chipset
and this will be going in a very very
special build with a special guest on
the channel hopefully very soon on the
channel next couple of weeks hopefully
we can get under way we've got the
motherboard there's a few other
components we're waiting on oh yeah
that's something cool to look forward to
I won't bother showing you the board
because you guys are probably seeing it
I'm not dropping quickly to be role but
yeah that I'm excited about all right
what do we have in this guy you know sir
pros well they look pretty impressive
okay so this is from cougar looks like a
gaming headset I don't think there's a
brand brand-new but still reasonably new
and they are the ultimate 7.1 Virtual
Surround
and brilliant lighting effect headset so
they're upselling themselves pretty
heavily they're 50 millimeter neodymium
magnet drivers have a look at these guys
and yeah pricing information for this
and all the other parts we've looked at
will be included in the video
description there'll be some Amazon
dialing some affiliate links there for
you guys to check out Hey look cool yeah
not as organized as I normally am for
unboxing boxes we're just going for it
on this one let's take another look okay
well like these are the orange
highlights there they are definitely
ovary those cups are massive
so there's steel reinforcing in here
they're like steel rods they're covered
in like oh they're sort of a rubber all
of this stuff here is all plastic but
still feels pretty thick pretty durable
have a retractable mic that's quite
bendy looks like it illuminates at the
end there and they connect looks like
probably to an inline controller
using a USB and that will be to give you
that virtual 7.1 effect okay so you've
got a micro USB adapter to a 4-pole 3.5
mm audio jack or you can go into this
little guy here and that plugs in via
USB and that's obviously sort of like a
USB soundcard so that's pretty cool
don't know pricing like I said I'll
provide a link in the video description
so I can't comment on how good a value I
think they are but I'll give these a
crack I'm actually they're so
comfortable really comfortable most
headphones or headsets I find give me a
bit of a headache after a while even if
they are over ear design but these ones
are massive those of you don't know I do
do a monthly patron washing with Brian
from jackieo City and I've been using
little any earbud things over the last
few to stop you're getting a headache
because we do tend to ramble on for a
while but I'll give these a go on the
next live stream anyway and I'll see how
I go I'll report back to you guys okay
we're getting there we've got two big
boxes and a little bag let's go up a
little bag little bag has two little
bubble wrapped boxes inside so for those
of you that watched the last episode of
unboxing boxes I did get the new
creative outlier headset I think it was
just the outlier can't remember any way
to go back there the orange ones since I
got there my wife has stolen them and
absolutely loves them and she's only had
to charge them once I think in that time
she uses them daily for listening to
audible and other things like that and
yeah absolutely loves them really good
value these ones I believe I think the
other ones were 70 us going completely
off the memory here I think these ones
like 50 or 60 us so they're about 10-ish
dollars cheaper let's say and I don't
know what the differences are I think so
these ones run for nine and a half hours
and the other ones had a run
about 11 hours so slightly less on the
runtime there I don't know if that's
about the only difference visually they
look pretty identical to be honest so
maybe it's just a difference of the
quality of a battery in them but I'm
gonna use these ones I'm not letting
anyone else in the family take him I'll
use these ones and test them out there's
a few accessories there's wings wings er
inserts and things like that
yeah very keen to give these ago again
I'll provide a link for a bio link in
the video description so you can check
them out
alright and in the bubble wrapped
package number two we have a brown box
creative metallics I believe it is
alright the box has got a little beaten
up in that satchel let's see what this
is all about I think it's a Bluetooth
speaker very compact one well the name
yeah the name suits that it's a sort of
aluminium metal ish case pretty much the
whole way around rubberized bottom
volume up volume down play little
speaker it's really clear as well
all right
well that's pretty cool I don't know how
much that cost but it's really
high-quality again I will try and dig it
up and provide a link in the video
description all right let's get into
this box and this box has another box in
it not gonna bother trying to pull that
out you should see the mess that's in
here it's gonna take me about now to
clean up okay so I put this around the
Oh
jewel tempered glass quite heavy so this
is arrow cools new p7c zero pro so
that's the name of the case it's kind of
a generic ish kind of soundy name but
the case itself I would say is anything
but generic so in the frontier it's got
a nice bigger grille plenty of airflow
for this case looks like it would anyway
looks like there's maybe some sort of
RGB lighting there we've got three RGB
fans in the front and they do have a
controller to control those up the top
we have a nice IO panel pair of USB
threes power reset two audio inputs
outputs Jack's around the back pretty
standard stuff power supply on the
bottom that's probably seven expansion
slots motherboard IO and a rear mounted
120-millimeter exhaust fan so I'll um
I'll try and I get something in that and
fire it up
give you guys a look at it okay so
there's one computer case
okay so this here is a new Kubik well
it's not in you case you guys it's kind
of you it's a cool case it was released
this year ah stop waving me set yeah
heap of youtubers have actually reviewed
it at this point so I won't be reviewing
it but I did want to unbox it check it
out I obviously haven't put it together
so this is definitely not put together
but I thought I did it earlier in the a
custom it was sort of we ended up making
an over watched themed computer case
kind of was a Verizon build I painted it
a few orange gray and I think maybe
black in a few spots anyway you guys
loved that thought was really cool
little bit crazy and heaps of you asked
I've been asking me ever since to do a
video on how to paint your computer case
so I thought since these things kind of
interesting kind of different it's got a
heap of cool unusual panels I thought I
might have a crack at painting this and
sort of doing like a guide on how to
paint your computer case so that will be
coming up on the channel I don't know
maybe early next year we'll see how I go
for time in December that could be a
pretty cool video so that's what I'm
going to do with this and I'll probably
do obviously some sort of cool build in
it as well so we did pretty well out of
this episode of unboxing boxes I do have
a lot of cleaning up to do but I've got
a new seat so that's cool I think you
raid max my new draconian seat Drakon
Drakon I think it is nice little
Bluetooth speaker there from creative
love that that's cool we got a Trier of
650 watt power supplies that has Rock
motherboard that x-29 board I can't wait
to do that all these bits power bits
that looks very cool so that'll be going
like I said in the shift XK so I can't
waste with that together and yeah just a
lot of stuff so I don't know how long
this episode went for
I hope you guys enjoyed it I know it was
very unorganized I didn't give you much
information like I normally do but yeah
let me know what you thought I'm not
changing this not changing the series to
be unorganized and all over the place
but I just had a Hiba boxes I thought
rather than open them and do the stuff
I'll unbox it on camera because you guys
say no like when you get to see the
price as they come in or when they come
in sit in my office for one that I
finally unbox them on camera anyway
that's gonna do it for this episode of
unboxing boxes I'm your host Steve I'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
