little video checking out some little
and I suppose fun hardware now a little
over a month ago I finally built the
ultimate value budget PC using the sweet
little cooler master master box like
three case a micro ATX motherboard from
asrock and of course the pentium g 4560
processor and making this little rig
gaming compatible was the geforce gtx
1050 this modest hardware combo was
surprisingly capable delivering very
playable performance in games such as
titanfall 2 Mass Effect Andromeda and
battlefield 1 for example in that video
I discussed the hardware used show a
time-lapse of the build and played the
game just mentioned along with a few
others you guys seem to really enjoy
that style of video and I had a heap of
requests to do an eSports version there
were also a good number of you keen to
see a do over with the RS 460 as many of
you probably know I'm madly working on a
massive rx 580 versus gtx 1060 video for
this friday which will be comparing the
two GPUs in over 25 games I'm making
good progress in that video so I decided
to take a break from it today and do
something a little different going with
the idea of an eSports version of that G
4560 video I thought I'd go one step
further and retest with the Radeon rx
550 AMD's new $80 US entry-level GPU the
Isuzu rx 550 model I have on hand is
very compact and like the GTX 1050
doesn't require an external power
connector the version on hand also packs
a full gigabyte of air and buffer but I
strongly recommend gamers up for the two
gigabyte version there's no way the rx
550 has anywhere near enough horsepower
to utilize anything bigger right now
even at $80 u.s. the rx 550 is actually
pretty poor in terms of value when
compared to the rx 560 it packs roughly
half as many stream processing units at
just 512 so you can expect roughly half
the performance for eSports titles that
should see the rx 550 still able to
deliver playable performance but price
just twenty percent less than the rx 560
it's going to be hard to justify that
percent reduction in cause so why use
the rx 550 at all them well it's my hope
that before too long we will start to
see rx 550 s selling Frizzle is $60 us
at that price it does start to make
sense and it would make for an awesome
$120 combo with the G 45 60 that said
how does the rx 550 perform with the G
45 60 and if priced around $60 us is
this a combo you should even consider to
answer that question I have queued up
seven popular eSports titles to see how
this budget combo makes out now please
be aware for this video I won't be
including any graphs or usual sort of
data breakdown type stuff that you guys
often find in the harbor unbox videos
rather for this one we are looking
exclusively at gameplay footage
hopefully next week I will have time to
retest and compare all the entry-level
GPUs side by side in a slew of graphs
for now let's just see how the rx 550
gets on with the G 45 60
yes
I painted threatened mineral fields
depleted
Oh
ah
a lot the enemy has taken our
intelligence
I really really hope it isn't too long
before we see rx 550 graphics cards
getting down to around $6 us for casual
gamers and even those keen on their
eSports titles and affordable rx 550 is
a great way to go the performance just
seen was very solid taxing titles such
as Starcraft 2 set around 80 FPS but
occasionally dropped down to 60 fps
where things got a bit heated
dota 2 with the quality settings maxed
out plated around 60 to 70 FPS though at
times did get into the 50s maxed out
World of Tanks played it between 40 or
50 fps the game looked good and was of
course very smooth then we have csgo
which was also maxed out and plated over
a hundred FPS at all times
it mostly hovered around 120 fps Team
Fortress 2 was tested using the highest
possible quality settings frame rates
dropped as low as 100 FPS but would
spike as high as 200 FPS for the most
part they framerate seemed to hover
somewhere in the middle for overwatch we
used the medium quality settings and
gameplay was extremely smooth with
around 60 FPS for the most part during
heavy battles then finally rocket League
maintained over 60 fps at all times and
frame rates are often found hovering
around 70 to 90 FPS so then the pentium
g 45 60 and Radeon rx 550 are a very
capable combo we just need that radio
and graphics card to become a little bit
cheaper for those of you that don't want
to spend time researching secondhand
hardware and taking on the various risks
associated there I'd highly recommend
this combo well that's going to do it
for this one guys I hope you enjoyed the
eSports action I'm going to get back to
working on that rx 580 vs GTX 1060
comparison I'll catch you again soon
