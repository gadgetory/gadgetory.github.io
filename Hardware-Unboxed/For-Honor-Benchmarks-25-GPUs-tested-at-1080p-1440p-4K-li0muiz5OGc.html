today I have another video game
benchmark for you and this time we're
looking at the news for on our game this
is an action fighting game developed by
Ubisoft for pc playstation 4 and xbox
one but of course we will be looking at
the pc version and putting it through
its paces as usual i'll be focusing too
much on the gameplay and I'm certainly
not going to be reviewing the game
instead we just hit a bench market and
see how different GPUs compare
FrontPoint Oh game engine and this is
the same game engine that was used for
2014 assassin creed unity 2015 s Rainbow
six siege and Assassin's Creed syndicate
on top of that we check out the beta
version of Ghost Recon wildlands last
week which also uses the engine so some
pretty impressive tiles have taken
advantage of this engine over the past
few years that said coming off the shaky
Ghost Recon wildlands better performance
last week you might be a bit concerned
regards to how Iran is going to play on
your PC the good news is though this
game actually appears very well
optimized and there are a heap of
tweakable settings on the PC as well as
a useful built-in benchmark tool the
display menu allows gamers to enable or
disable things like vsync change the
resolution and aspect ratio as well as
the display mode and even monitor
meanwhile the graphics menu provides for
presets which have been labeled low
medium high and extreme for testing I've
used the extreme preset to see what it
takes to run this game at all of its
glory extreme sets things like texture
filtering of 16 times enables motion
blur dynamic reflections and MH bao
ambient occlusion it also maxes out the
geometric detail texture quality dynamic
shadows and environment detail finally
this also sets the anti-aliasing method
to taa for those of you wondering
Ubisoft recommends gamers use a CPU that
is equal to or greater than the core i5
2500 k or AMD fx-6300 eight gigabytes of
system memory for the GPU they recommend
the geforce gtx 680 or the AMD radeon r9
280x so there aren't exactly steep
requirements but I'm keen to see how the
game runs on the latest and previous
generation GPUs I should note this is an
nvidia
sponsored title and NVIDIA has game
ready drivers available AMD has also
managed to sneak out early driver
support that is said to boost the RX for
80s performance by four to five percent
so that's an impressive achievement and
of course i have tested using that very
driver just to clarify i have tested
using the nvidia 37 866 whql driver and
the AMD 17-point 3.1 relived driver we
start all our testing takes place using
our core i7 7700 KHS machine which sees
the processor running at 4.9 gigahertz
with 32 gigabytes of ddr4 3000 memory
the performance numbers you have to see
are based on the built-in benchmark
which I found to do a pretty good job of
making in-game performance at least as
far as the GPU is concerned I did find
that the CPU was text much more heavily
we're actually playing the game but
since I won't be showing CPU performance
of this video that isn't an issue here's
a quick look at part of the benchmark
Before we jump to the results okay so
first up we have the old bangers the
rusty old renderers from a time almost
forgotten sitting at the top of the heat
we have the GeForce GTX 980 TI which
admittedly is still a weapon worthy of
much respect so to as AMD's fury ex and
although 8% slower it did turn in an
impressive 98 FPS average the little
nano knocked off the vanilla GTX 980
though the once-proud Maxwell offering
did beat out the r9 390 X interestingly
the GTX 970 makes it very well here
sticking with the r9 390 a graphics card
has gotten used to seeing from a
distance both spat out 72 FPS on average
with a 55 FPS minimum and more
importantly both provided very playable
performance at tep with all the eye
candy turned on even the gtx 960 and r9
380 didn't do too poorly although the
380 was faster that said we often find
when overclocking these gpus to the max
that the gtx 960 does come out on top
both will ideally require a downgrade in
the visual department and the hype reset
or maybe even the medium preset would
work best here moving to 1440p we find
that a spot at short term memory issues
the furious
gets on just fine working within 1 FPS
of the GTX 980 I while matching at 50
FPS minimum the nana also pulled well
ahead of the gtx 980 here once again we
find the GTX 970 and r9 390 still locked
in a heated battle and both are just
able to deliver perfectly playable
performance at 1440p beyond that though
gamers will be reaching for the escape
kicker and heading for the graphics menu
where they will be opting for either the
high or medium quality presets instead
then those running the r7 370 or slower
might even alts happened direct their
nearest browser window towards amazon
for a bit of an upgrade the 4k
resolution was never really friendly
towards the gtx 980 or fury ex and 2017
gaming isn't going to change that still
a 32 FPS average from both graphics
cards wasn't bad but those aiming for
this extreme resolution will want to
dial from settings back again worth
pointing out the fact that is slightly
smaller memory buffer the few x
maintains a higher minimum frame rate
still dust free ring rust isn't an issue
for this lot they've been battling it
out non-stop since their introduction in
fact it's been a back-and-forth
barnburner between the IRS 480 and gtx
1060 for months now for honor doesn't
exactly settle the dispute either both
drop down to the same 62 SPS minimum
skinny p and while the gtx 1060 did push
slightly ahead for the average there
isn't exactly a lot in it the three
gigabyte 1060 and four gigabyte r x 480
are also very competitive and the
results are within the margin of error
as we've come to expect the RX 470
completely hoses the gtx 750ti while the
vanilla 1050 remains the most cocky
budget GPU offering the RX 460 will end
of a few extra calls to help it out
moving to 1440p you can naturally forget
about the sub $150 offerings in fact
even the RX 470 struggles here using the
extreme preset the three gigabyte 1060
takes a bit of a hit on the minimum
frame rate and while I'm not
catastrophic it does clearly fall behind
the full gigabyte r x 480 meanwhile the
gtx 1060 and r x 480 continued to battle
it out in what I'm sure as an honourable
fight so no name-calling is going on
here then for a smoother experience the
gtx 1070 really delivers and if you must
say above 60 FPS at all times then a gtx
1080 will be in order as a recap of
this generation gtx 980 and fury Rex
we're good for 32 SPS on average at 4k
if you can afford it the Titan XP blows
them both right out of the water with
over seventy percent more performance
delivering a fairly smooth 55 FPS on
average of course the Titan XP is a year
newer and over eighty percent more
expensive so I'm not saying we should
hold a parade that's honor but yeah it's
still pretty fast I still haven't come
up with an intelligent way to display
this much data in a video at one time
and if we're waiting for me to come up
with a breakthrough well get used to
squinting anyway what we have here are
the tiny appear results from both the
previous and current generation GPUs
crammed into a single graph for those
that do want to study these numbers
without having to use a 60-inch TV
please check out the written version
which is published over a text book I'll
provide the link in the video
description just quickly here all the
1440p results again it was great to see
some of the previous generation big
hitters like the fury ax and gtx 980 i
still mixing it up amongst the big boys
finally the 4k results ironically I have
squeezed 25 graphics cards into this
graph and just two of them are really
relevant a bit silly I know but if I
didn't include this graph that one guy
would be like Steve where's the 4k
performance with all the GPUs and not
the best use of my time so let's just
wrap this up virani isn't really my
style of video game i have to admit but
even so i did find it quite a bit of fun
to play and more importantly for those
of you who love action fighting games
for honor p is very well optimized on
the pc 1080p gamers should have little
trouble maxing out the visuals as i
found last season's r9 380 and gtx 960
could deliver playable performance
meanwhile the RX 470 gtx 970 and r9 390
all delivered a very satisfying
experience these three GPUs were also
very capable at 1440p though for a truly
smooth experience you who want something
like the fury ax gtx 980 TI or gtx 1070
as always for keg aiming is best left to
the big boys making the Titan XP and GTX
1080 dear only two really relevant
graphics cards here at least for now for
those of you wondering the game isn't
massively see for you demanding and does
play quite well on something like a core
i3 6100 that said ambs FX 8370 was quite
a bit slower than 6,100 so if you want
to see a full break
on of fur on a cpu performance let me
know in the comments and I'll see what I
can do about creating a video I how I
said I was going to wrap this up well I
accidentally lied if that's the thing
before completing the video i went back
and recorded the RX 488 gigabyte and GTX
1066 gigabyte going through the built-in
benchmark and decided to show the
footage side by side I know a lot of you
guys really like this kind of thing but
for those of you who don't feel free to
skip ahead by about 40 seconds for
testing I now use board partner cards
since they represent the actual
performance many of you were going to
see I mean come on guys who out there
pays a premium for a founders edition
graphics card or a hot AMD reference
card that often throttles that's right I
don't see too many hands seriously
though the EVGA GTX 1064 the win plus
and the MSI our X 480 game at X do
represent the best out of the box
performance you're going to find that
says they aren't exactly worlds
different from the base models either as
you saw earlier both are able to live a
very playable 1440p performance in for
honor the benchmark pass you're watching
now has been conducted at tammy p using
the extreme quality preset so you should
have seen framerate staying mostly above
60 FPS this benchmark does a good job of
mixing things up and there are a few
different seems to be rendered here the
benchmarks finishes and gives us a
breakdown of the performance from the
sixth zones tested and as you can see
the results are very competitive well
that about does it for this one let me
know what you guys think about the
results in the comment section below and
if you've already picked up for honor
please let us know how it runs on your
rig also for the written version was
nice big easy to digest grass please
check out the link in the video
description which will head you in the
direction of text spot over in the
written version at text but I did test a
grand total of 45 GPU so a fair bit more
than what's found in this video there's
definitely some older cards that you may
still be interested in there and also
throw in a few different CPUs as well so
that makes for interesting comparison
and there are some c4 you scaling
results as well so it's certainly worth
checking out I'm your host Steve and I'm
going to go and have a long nap I'll
probably send up dreaming about sword
fights anyway though medieval swords are
whatever i'll catch you guys next time
all right then if I refuse there would
be a slaughter
