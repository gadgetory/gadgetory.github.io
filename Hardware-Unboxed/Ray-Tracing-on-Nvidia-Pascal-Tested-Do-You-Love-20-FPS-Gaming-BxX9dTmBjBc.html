time to take a look at rate racing on
videos Pasco GPUs the feature that
opened up to all last week through the
release of driver version 4 25.30 one
prior to this you needed an Nvidia
chewing r-tx graphics card to get all
the visual benefits of ray-tracing but
for a variety of reasons I'll get to
later you can now access rate racing in
today's games on Pascal GPUs from the
gtx 1066 gigabyte and up along with
nuturing GTX GPUs like the gtx 1660 TI
i'll be honesty a bit a little sick in
the past week so i haven't been able to
do as much testing on this topic as i'd
normally like but i have managed to take
the most powerful pascal GPU i have the
NVIDIA Titan X and put it against
invidious RT X lineup in all three of
the games available today that support
rate racing now we all know ray tracing
on Pasco GPUs is going to suck this
isn't some big surprise it's just a
simple fact of having a GPU that doesn't
have any specific acceleration built in
for a very performance intensive
graphical effect but there are some
interesting questions about ray tracing
on Pascal that I did want to answer the
first is to what degree does Pascal suck
is a card like the Titan X faster than
the slowest RT X GPU v RT X 2060 NVIDIA
has given out a few benchmarks they give
us some indication but of course we want
to verify this with our own data and in
particular look at not just average
frame rates but 1% lows and general
performance swings within a gaming
session the other question is whether
you can still get some form of
acceptable performance from a Pascal
card while ray-tracing despite knowing
full well the performance in general is
not going to be great for example can
this card run a game at above 30 FPS at
1080p with acceptable ray-tracing
quality this will allow some gamers to
genuinely try out ray tracing without
being forced to view a slideshow so
let's get into the data and as always
I've used my Korra $9.99 hundred K test
rig for these benchmarks with 16
gigabytes of ddr4 memory not that these
titles are CPU or memory bottleneck to
our ray tracing all of the data you see
here is from the latest versions of the
games with the latest drivers installed
I know that
slight battlefield 5 are continuing to
optimize their ray-tracing performance
so it's crucial with these sorts of
tests to use up-to-date benchmark data
you'll see the areas we've tested in
each game as we get to them let's kick
things off here with shadow of the Tomb
Raider the latest game to include ray
tracing through the form of shadows when
I tested this game previously I found
that only one of the three ray tracing
modes makes any sense to use and that's
the ultra mode the high mode produces
worst visual quality than disabling ray
tracing in my opinion while medium has a
very limited scope for ratio shadows so
for the testing here I've used the ultra
mode we'll start here with a 1080p data
and as expected the Titan X is falling
between the artex 2070 and RT x 2080
when ray tracing is disabled and all of
the settings are set to their maximum
level however when enabling ultra ray
tracing the Titan X immediately drops to
a level of performance below the r-tx
2060 in fact it's 10% slower when
looking at average frame rates but a
huge 34 percent slower when viewing 1%
lows and this begins to illustrate one
of the key problems with ray tracing on
Pascal specifically the experience is
extremely inconsistent this is because
there is such a large difference between
the capabilities of a card like the
Titan X without ray tracing and with ray
tracing so as you move around an
environment with varying ray accounts
interactions and degrees of ray tracing
the performance of the Titan X
fluctuates massively in areas with
little ray tracing performance is decent
but when you're in an area with lots of
shadows your frame rate can absolutely
tanked as you can see in this chart one
percent low performance so 21 FPS is
unplayable and that's just at 1080p but
if you had gone by just the average
perform it's 47 FPS sounds all right you
know it sounds decent the actual
experience of playing the game though is
far from that now of course you do also
get a fluctuating framerate with our TX
GPUs including the RT X 2060 but the
issue is less pronounced the GPU is
simply not as fast in areas without ray
tracing and it can keep up better when
ray tracing is enabled the one percent
low frame rate for the our Tex 2060 was
a touch over 30 FPS which isn't amazing
but it's an experience that is somewhat
ok move you to 1440p and it gets even
worse for the Titan X we're down to a 30
FPS average and just a 14 fps 1% low
which is completely unplayable the
margins between the our TX 2
sixteen tight necks are a little narrow
here as the 2060 also struggles at 1440p
but with the titan clocking in more than
30 percent slower in the most intensive
areas Pascal's simply can't keep up
let's take a look at a more positive
game for Pascal and that's battlefield 5
here are recommended setting to use is
low reflections it doesn't have as many
effects as the high or ultra modes but
it's a good starting point and these
days the performance hit isn't nearly as
bad as it once was at 1080p we're
looking in a reasonably significant drop
in performance for the Titan X coming
from well over 120 fps with the ray
tracing disabled down to just 70 FPS on
average with ray tracing however once
again 1% loads get hammered having here
from just low ray tracing perhaps the
most interesting thing is that unlike
with shadow of the Tomb Raider in
battlefield 5 Pascal is more competitive
with the RT X 2016 on average it's a
little faster and in the most intensive
areas it's a little slower
we aren't anywhere near the performance
of VRTX 2080 which comes closest to the
Titan X when ray tracing is disabled but
you do a fairly light implementation of
ray tracing with the low mode the Titan
X isn't as overwhelmed and it performs
all right here in fact with the 1% low
of 46 FPS the game is playable here
performance still does fluctuate a lot
but at least it's not dipping to
slideshow levels on the regular so at
1080p with low ray tracing and a cut as
powerful as a Titan X or 1080 Ti you
could conceivably play the game without
tearing your hair out would anyone
sacrifice over a hundred FPS at this
resolution for this performance
well probably not but at least it is
possible to try it out at 1440p the
situation isn't as promising with 1%
lows closer to 30 FPS for the Titan X
which in a multiplayer shooter is really
not acceptable we're also starting to
see a divergence between the Titan X and
RT X 2060 on average of the Titan is
faster but it's much slow in the most
intensive areas of our benchmark run
this makes sense as more Ray's need to
be cast at a higher resolution and any
increase in ray tracing will punish
Pascal more than Turing RT X the final
game we're looking at here is Metro
Exodus which uses ray-traced global
illumination when I first tested the
game I used the benchmark tool but I've
switched to an in-game run here focusing
on the high mode which I feel is the
best to use in the game based on my
previous Explorer
I didn't even bother testing 1440p in
this toilet because at 1080p were
already at an unplayable level with the
time next a 30 FPS average with the 1%
low of 23 fps is simply not good enough
and in this game there is no rate racing
level below high so you can basically
rule out Pascal entirely if you want to
use rate racing in this title the Titan
X is well behind the ITX 2060 here more
than 30 percent behind in fact which
again makes sense as global elimination
is one of the most intensive ray tracing
effects and one where acceleration is
very useful and again comparing the
tight next to something like the ITX
2080 shows that the RT cores are
providing double to triple the
performance with this effect enabled we
can expect a similar difference between
pascal and accelerated tutoring in games
that use multiple ray tracing effects
the more effects are added the more
useful the RT course become so what does
this investigation tell us overall well
the first thing is that I really didn't
need to test any slower cards that the
Titan X 2 of the three games are already
unplayable at 1080p with the Titans so
you can guess how fast a card like a gtx
1070 would be the only test condition
that was remotely usable was battlefield
5 at 1080p with low rate racing but even
then I would expect a cheat X 1080 to
barely hit 30fps in the most intensive
areas and performance to fall away
further from there so this sense is one
of the key questions I had going in no
Pascal really is not fast enough to give
game as usable rate racing experience
even if they're just you know
investigating or playing around unless
you have one of the top and Pascal cards
and the ray-traced effects aren't too
intensive as more rate race games come
out Pascal it's only going to fall
further behind so I don't see much of a
future for any last generation card when
it comes to rate racing in the absolute
best case scenario the Titan X matches
the r-tx 2064 rate racing capabilities
but often Falls 30% behind or more
especially when looking at crucial 1%
load data the Titan also delivers a less
consistent experience which will annoy
gamers that hate frame rate fluctuations
normally the Titan X is at least 25%
faster than the ITX between 60 and more
up around RTX 2080 territory but without
those RT calls it just can't keep up
with invidious latest mid-range GPU and
I guess this brings up the question many
people have been asking which is how
much do the arty cause and other bits
and bobs in the chewing architecture
help accelerate rate racing compared to
pascal this is more of just an interest
sake type question but we do not have
some rough data of it can give some
insights the main comparison would have
to be between the Titan X and the RT X
2080 which are reasonably matched
outside of ray tracing the architects
2080 is faster but not by all that much
but when ray tracing is factored in the
RT x 2080 is anywhere from 26 percent
faster with low reflections in
battlefield 5 to more than 50% faster in
shadow of the tomb raider
2 over twice as fast in metro Exodus
considering tu-104 the GPU used in the
art x 2080 packs in only 13% more
transistors than GP 102 which was used
for the titan x and GT x 1080 TI I'd say
this level of acceleration is actually
reasonably impressive and justifies the
extra RT caused at least for these games
and effects Nvidia really couldn't have
just brute force ray tracing through
cramming in more cuda cores the data
does show definitively that ray tracing
with RT core acceleration is more
efficient I don't think the level of
acceleration is disappointing either
more than a 2x improvement when ray
tracing is heavily used is a decent
start from a first gen design and one
that only packs in that 13% more
transistors of course spending die space
on specialized cores for ray tracing
doesn't help performance in the vast
majority of games that don't support the
feature but I've already talked
endlessly about the value proposition of
ray tracing in RTX cards so really don't
want to rehash that here also you've
already heard us say that we still
recommend playing with ray tracing
disabled even on our TX cards that
hasn't changed with this investigation
but bashing ray tracing on our TX cards
again isn't really the point of this
video either
however after doing all of this testing
I'm sort of left with a question of what
is the point
why hasn't video bother testing and
enabling ray tracing on Pascal you know
it doesn't run well even on high-end
GPUs it's unlikely to improve with
future games and it just seems like
something people wouldn't use even if it
was available
aside from allowing people like us to
test ray tracing on Pascal and show how
much acceleration the arti cores provide
another technical insights from average
consumer the benefits don't seem to
outweigh the cost of Nvidia developing
this support
so I have two theories as to why the
first is for developers let's say you
have a development studio that invested
heavily into Pascal and has loads of
cards like this very tight and EXO use
for this testing in their dev machines
rather than forcing developers into
upgrading to cheering to develop games
with ray-tracing allowing Pascal cards
to rate race
albian slowly could improve the adoption
of rate racing in games developers don't
need 60 or even 30 FPS to test rate
racing in their games so it could be
handy for them this has a variety of
benefits from Nvidia as they you know
her interests in improving adoption to
sell more r-tx cards the other theory is
basically pure marketing by enabling
Pascal owners to run rate racing they're
getting a first-hand look at how
terrible it runs on their existing GPU
which might you incentivize an upgrade
to an art xgp you in our opinion rate
racing alone isn't enough to justify an
upgrade but I'm sure this will work for
a number of Pascal gamers I don't think
this is a bad move
having features unlocked for more GPU
owners is generally a good thing and
down the line there might be a ray
traced game that actually does run well
on Pascal but like most of our videos on
ray tracing so far we're still in the
very early stages of the technology and
will only become a significant factor in
buying decisions in a few generations
time that's it for this one time to rest
up and edit this video give it a thumbs
up if you liked it subscribe for more
analysis and investigations like this in
the future because this is supporting us
on patreon to get access to some cool
perks I'll catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
