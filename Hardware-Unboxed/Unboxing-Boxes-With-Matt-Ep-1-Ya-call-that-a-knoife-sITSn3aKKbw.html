i'm your host Matt and I figured since I
got a bunch of deliveries the other day
and the channels been around now for
more than a year it was probably time to
do some actual unboxing so I've got with
me my trusty knife although you call
this a knife this is a knife let's get
stuck into some of these boxes things
probably too big this is a labyrinth
tearing time ah so these are called
power cubes and there's nothing to be
much benchmarking for these things they
just a fancy little power board so guys
like set up to is and that's the other
thing you probably be into these might
do a quick video on these the next few
days what's next
look I'm going to cut my hand off with
this thing ah cool these are the new
fans from corsair the ml 140s I got
these for a build got coming up so I'll
pop them out of the box for you guys
that's what they look like they're they
light up really nice so these these Liam
look really cool there's some sort of
rubber mounts in the corners clear
blades and a way to you see them light
up fri decapitate myself I'm going to
switch back to my baby knife I think so
this is thermal takes new water block
for their 10 series and video cards so
actually going into a build I previewed
the other day and we should have part
one of that out this week so be sure to
check that out it's a fully water-cooled
build and I'm gonna be using hard tube
so should look pretty damn cool all
right this box is massive but it's very
light so really sure what's going to be
in here there's so much tape on this
thing
I me a bubble wrap for the kids wow this
tiny box balls in there so this is a big
old memory kit from g.skill that's also
going to be going into that build that I
just mentioned take out one in the
sticks you guys some very cool-looking
memory and look awesome the building
ready got some masseuse tape so that's a
bit of a giveaway for this one I can't
actually remember which card it is so
let's find out I've got about a thousand
requests for a strict card so be able to
answer those very soon nice so it's the
1070 type of look at the card cool the
box and soos in search of incredible
alright so that's the card pretty damn
long got a nice back plate look forward
to comparing this to the 10 7 news from
the other tribe manufactures valve share
this moment with you back plate it's
actually really cool looking right one
box to go looks graphics card size to me
hmm gigabyte get another 1060 partner
card to take a look at so it'll be good
pop it open and take a look the g one
gaming 1060 the knife back play it on
that one too a lot smaller than the 1070
be interesting to put it through its
paces I've got one more announcement to
make the RX 480 competition will be
ending this saturday on the thirtieth of
july so i'll be announcing the winner
for that and one lucky viewers going to
