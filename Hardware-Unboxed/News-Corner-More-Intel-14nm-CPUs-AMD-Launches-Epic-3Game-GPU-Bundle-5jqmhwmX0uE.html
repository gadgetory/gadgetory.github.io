corner plenty of news to get through
this week including four interrelated
stories in a row so strap yourselves in
for that one plus the usual range of
other tidbits thankfully there won't be
any gtx 1180 rumors in this one so let's
get on with it
we're going to start with a quick
interrelated story here earlier this
week at the data center Innovation
Summit Intel revealed their official
xeon roadmap for the next few years and
surprise there's more 14 nanometer
processes coming in 2019 the roadmap
starts with cascade Lake which we
already knew is coming in the fourth
quarter of this year with support for
avx-512 B n ni Intel obtained persistent
memory and hardware security mitigations
for some of the issues Intel has been
facing recently nothing really has
changed here and of course these chips
will be 14 nanometers probably 14
nanometer + + next year Intel is stuck
on 14 nanometers again for their Xeon
line which I'm sure wasn't their
original plan many years ago anyway
Intel our famously struggling with 10
millimeters so what we're getting for
service in 2019 is Cooper Lake again
built on 14 nanometer but with some
improvements to various service specific
instruction sets and so forth and then
finally in 2020 Intel will transition
Xeon to 10 nanometer with ice Lake
cascade Lake will use the existing
hardware platform introduced with Sky
like SP last year while Cooper Lake and
ice Lake will move to a new platform
with an LGA 4189 socket while we're not
usually a channel that discusses server
hardware it will be interesting to see
how Intel's the online competes on 14
down a meter with ambe's upcoming epic
lines using seven nanometer process tech
from other fabs until sluggish progress
on 10 nanometer could start to hurt them
very soon the second Intel story
surrounds whiskey Lake the code name for
Intel's upcoming line of 14 nanometer
processors HP accidentally published
specs for their upcoming Pavilion x360
laptops which revealed a new set of 15
watt u series processors that are likely
whiskey Lake interestingly the SKUs use
eighth generation browning which
replaced them in the same series as
current 8th gen KB Lake refresh parts
anyway the big news here is whiskey Lake
will bring massive improvements to turbo
frequencies compared to K
like refresh while base clocks allowed
to do the same a CP like the core i7 85
65 you boasts a 4.6 gigahertz turbo
clock competitors 4 gigahertz with the
existing core i7 8550 you similarly the
I 580 265 you has the 700 megahertz
higher boost clock in the 8250 you and
the i3 80 145 you jumps up by 500
megahertz over the I 380 130 you other
specifications appear to remain the same
the core i5 and i7 models will still be
quad cores while the core i3 will be a
dual core processor graphics also
appears to be the same offering Intel
UHD 620 with 24 execution units these
new whiskey leg processes should improve
performance for 15 watt class products
in short workloads that can make good
use of they're significantly higher
boost clocks but I'd spent clock speeds
to fall rapidly after the first few
seconds leaving us with sustained
performance around the same level as
existing cable oak refresh CPUs another
Intel story this time relating to a new
line of knucks codenamed crimson Canyon
set for launch in September and
available for pre-order now crimson
Canyon NOx combine a 15 watt Intel
Ussuri CPU with discrete AMD Radeon
graphics the first nut from Intel to
feature a discrete GPU and I guess a
continuation of Intel's partnership with
AMD on graphics there are two basically
identical crimson Canyon skews the only
difference being a gig of ram versus
four gigabytes both use the core i3 8121
you intel's 15 watt cannon like part
built on 10 nanometer tech while it is
attending a meter cpu it's not exactly
impressive packing just two cores and
four threads called - 2.2 gigahertz with
a boost clock of 3.2 gigahertz there's
no I GPU in the 8121 you hence why
Tinto's included a Polaris based AMD
Radeon 540 GPU in these systems as well
the 4 gig configuration will be
available five hundred and thirty
dollars while the eight gig model will
come in at $575
this actually seems pretty expensive
considering the rest of the wig hardware
you get so I'm not sure if these nuts
will sell particularly well in to
release their new SSD 660 pay during the
flash memory summit 2018 the first
mainstream drive to use qlc memory for
those not familiar with ql seed
increases the number of voltage levels
per cell allowing for bits to be stored
compared to three for TLC and two for M
see which of course improves density but
as there are more voltage levels
tolerances are higher which potentially
hurt performance and endurance PC
perspective reviewed the SSD is 660 P
defended to perform pretty darn well for
a budget class SSD particularly in
random workloads and anything that
doesn't saturate the SLC cache when the
cache is saturated right speeds are
slower due to those tighter tolerances
but the cache is quite large so for most
workloads it shouldn't be a huge issue
the drives come in at $20 per gigabyte
as well which is very competitive
considering the performance and the
5-year warranty is a nice bonus
it sounds like a pretty compelling SSD
option and could replace slower SATA
drives at similar prices AMD has
launched a new game bundle for their
graphics cards called raised the game
basically if you purchase an RX Vegas 64
Vega 56 rx 5 ad or rx 570 from a
participating retailer you'll get 3 free
games Assassin's Creed Odyssey Strange
Brigade and star control origins none of
these games have been released just yet
but you do get all three when you
purchase one of the cards from a
participating retailer between August
7th and November 3rd while stocks last
of course when you redeem your coupon
you'll be sent the game keys for the
titles when they are released Assassin's
Creed Odyssey is obviously the big one
here and that will be released on
October 5th while strange Brigade comes
out on August 28th and start control
origins on September 20th if you were
interested in these games and wanted an
AMD GPU it's a pretty good deal
especially considering it's available
with the cheaper rx 570 Japan next has a
new 35 inch ultra wide gaming monitor
known as the you've got to be kidding me
known as the JN 35 VCG 200 u w HD while
it is being advertised as a 200 Hertz
curved display it isn't using the new 34
40 by 1440 200 Hertz panels instead it's
just a regular old 2560 by 1080 a.m. VA
panel this means fairly typical specs
300s brightness 2001 contrast ratio 3
millisecond grader great response times
and support for AMD freesync and with
the top-end refresh rate of 200 Hertz
I'd expect the monitor to support low
framerate compensation although the
refresh rate floor isn't specified
and next is selling the monitor for a
discounted price of around seventy
thousand yen which is about six hundred
and thirty u.s. dollars that discounted
price is probably a little on the high
side concerning the ace of predators ed
thirty-five is available with similar
specs and gsync is sort of freesync for
six hundred dollars but the panel could
be different this story broke much early
in the week but it's still interesting
if you missed it amy has designed a new
semi custom SOC for a Chinese game
console which includes Zen CPU cores and
a Vega GPU on the one die considering
this sot specifications it is an
entirely new die rather than a
repurposed apu or other semi custom chip
which makes it particularly interesting
the chip used for the Zhongshan soup or
console packs for Zen cores and eight
threads clocked up to three gigahertz
alongside 24 Vega compute units clocked
up to 1,300 megahertz
it also includes a gddr5 controller
which will be attached to eight gig of
ram in the console it's an interesting
mix of pieces from other AMD products
the CPU is very similar to current Zen
based Raven Ridge a piece like the
horizon 520 400 G while the Vega GPU is
like a higher cost version of the GPU
included with Intel's KB Lake G in terms
of performance the Zen CPU will be much
faster than the eight core Jaguar
included with the Xbox one and
PlayStation 4 series while the GPU will
sit between the ps4 and PS 4 Pro though
closer to the regular ps4 this chip is a
nice little win for AMD semi-custom
division which is clearly gaining more
partners than just the big console
manufacturers the superball console is
expected to launch in China before the
end of 2018 so it'll be interesting to
see what it brings now into the quicker
topics to run at this news corner
firstly for at 76 won't be coming to
steam instead it will be exclusive to
the Bethesda dotnet platform yeah it's
just awesome that we're gonna have to
install another launcher for this sort
of games I guess at least it's not the
Windows Store interested to hear your
thoughts on this one let us know in the
comments below if not having for that 76
on Steam will impact your decision to
buy or play it and in other news discord
is launching a game store this is an
interesting one because discord is
widely used by gamers to chat with
friends or even your favorite youtubers
through patreon exclusive discord rooms
intent on that one so there's actually a
chance that
storm might be successful when you
purchase through the store games are
added to your discord account and then
you can launch them through the app with
other basic functionality I still
recommend as we'll use steam to buy
their games and discord to chat though
that's it this week's news corner as
always hit the subscribe button to get
this segment in your inbox every Friday
