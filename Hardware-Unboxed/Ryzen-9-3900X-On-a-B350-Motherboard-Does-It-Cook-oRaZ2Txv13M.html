bloody windy here I am so if there's a
lot of background noise then yeah I
apologize for that
but unfortunately there isn't too much I
can do about it Rison processes just
aren't quite powerful enough to control
the weather yet anyway today we're
looking at how the new 3rd generation
processors work on a really affordable
be 350 motherboard and the test subject
for this experiment is the asrock a B
350 M pro 4 and you might be asking why
this particular as rocker micro ATX
motherboard and the reason is quite
simple this was one of my top picks for
the best ultra cheap be 350 motherboard
and coming in at just $75 it was a steal
back in 2017 it's also a great candidate
for our 3rd gen rise and testing on a be
350 board because it is extremely basic
it packs a three phase V core very
amusing a four phase is l9 571 -
controller but we do get a doubling of
components so each phase features two
high side MOSFETs and two low side
MOSFETs so in that sense it's pretty
decent for a sub $100 a m4 motherboard
now in this video I want to investigate
two main things can a budget be 350
motherboards safely support the horizon
930 900 X for example how hot does the
vrm get during a torture test so we'll
be strapping on a few k-type
thermocouple to find out then assuming
we don't cook this poor little
motherboard we'll be looking at things
like well are there any thermal issues
power limitations or anything else that
may be limiting performance of the third
gen Rison CPUs and obviously to do that
I will be testing the 3900 X 3700 X and
then the vanilla 3600 that we just
reviewed and I'll be testing yes all of
those out on this asrock board and then
comparing that to the data we've already
gathered on the MSI x5 70 creation using
BIOS version 5.9 T the asrock a be 350 M
pro 4 does support them two processors
using their GC version 1.0 0.1 please
the MSI x5 70 Croatian was tested using
the latest bias which uses a juicer
version 100.3
and this version was used for all
previous testing and performs as
expected so let's jump straight into the
results and first up we have the RM
temperatures and we'll look at what I
would say as a worst case scenario first
at least until the horizon 939 50x
arrives
I don't expect many will be looking at
pairing a 3900 X with an entry level be
350 motherboard but it is useful
information for a few years down the
track at which point you'll likely be
able to snag one of these 12 core parts
for peanuts
now all this testing has been conducted
on an open test bench with no additional
cooling however it's not that
unrealistic as I'm using the Box cooler
which does direct airflow over the vrm
heatsink or at least one of them anyway
so this setup has the advantage of cool
air circulation as it's not stuffed in a
poorly ventilated case but it has the
disadvantage that there is no direct
airflow from case fans so stock the
Rison 930 900 sucked down 145 watts and
this push of RM temps to peak at 65
degrees for the underside of the PCB
where most of the heat is dissipated
while the top side of the mosfet driver
picked at just 51 degrees both are very
safe operating temperatures for these
components and with 8 sensors I covered
the board very well so what you see here
are the hot spots
now enabling PBO with the Box cooler it
is rather pointless as all it does is
increase power consumption while
resulting in really no extra performance
still it does stress the vert more so
for this testing we are interested in
doing exactly that this increased the
peak temperature on the underside of the
PCB by 22% and now we're seeing the
board get up to around 80 degrees
although these temperatures aren't
dangerous they are getting a bit too hot
to sustain for long periods of time the
board is also right on the edge now and
with the PBO plus order OC feature
enabled in the rise and master software
the asrock a B 350 M pro 4 did come
unstuck the board didn't suffer any
major failure or crash but the blender
won our stress test did closed down to
the desktop after about 20 minutes and
this happened three times in a row so I
just took the hint and gave the little
be 350 board arrests in short it looks
like the asrock a B 350 M
four can comfortably deliver 150 watts
but once you start pushing over 180
watts it just wants to pack it in moving
over to the 65 watt TDP horizon 730 700
X the be 350 board didn't break a sweat
sadly I didn't measure the peak package
power consumption when testing with a 37
under X I just didn't think of it at the
time I did test this protestor first and
it only occurred to me that this would
be an interesting thing to report when I
was testing with the more power-hungry
3900 X anyway even with PB o plus Auto C
enabled the 3700 X ran flawlessly on the
asrock board and vrm temps only picked
at 46 degrees which is obviously very
safe that being the case I didn't waste
any time testing the rise in 536 hundred
it's obviously not going to stress the
vrm so let's just move on
actually I did encounter one issue with
the r5 3600 the memory support was a
little bit flaky on this board whereas
the rise and 5 processor worked just
fine with ddr4 3200 memory on the x5 70
board it only worked up to ddr4 3000 on
the asrock be 350 board which is a bit
interesting because the 3700 X and 3900
X worked just fine with ddr4 3200 memory
on this exact board though ddr4 3600
didn't work at all and I should just
clarify by not work it actually did post
with ddr4 3200 memory it loaded into
Windows and it ran a lot of our
benchmarks but if blue screened every
time we tried to run at the blender
stress test so it works to a degree so
maybe a future BIOS can iron out those
stability issues but for now if you want
it to be perfectly stable ddr4 3000 is
the limit so memory support isn't nearly
as good as the x5 70 motherboards but
that was almost certainly going to be
the case so no surprises there it's
possible that future BIOS revisions will
enhance memory support but it's just as
likely that the signal quality on the a
be 350 pro 4 just isn't good enough to
go beyond ddr4 3200 and then for the
lower quality been CPU such as the r5
3600 even 3200 is out of the question
this means for the benchmarks that
you're about to see the 3900 X and 3700
X were tested using ddr4 3200 CL 14
memory while the 3600
was tested using ddr4 3000 CL 14 memory
interestingly despite the change in
memory frequency the r5 3600 actually
sees the smallest performance
discrepancy between the two boards
tested the x5 70 board was just under 1%
faster so chalk that up to margin of
error the 3700 X on the other hand was 3
percent faster on the x5 70 board not a
big margin by any means but it was
consistently 2 to 3% faster then we see
the 3900 X was 4 percent faster on the
x5 70 board again not a big margin but
there was clearly a small performance
uplift when using the more modern board
but the board also Custer and seven
times more so I guess keep that in mind
when testing with blender I noticed the
typical all core clock frequency it did
jump around quite a bit but after about
half an hour it settled into the clock
speeds that you see reported here
basically the 3100 X clocked two and a
half percent higher on the X 570 board
the 3700 X clock 2.7 percent higher and
the r5 1600 clocked 0.1 percent higher
ensure performance was the same for the
r5 3600 the 3700 X took 2 percent longer
to complete the test and the 3900 X took
4 percent longer pretty much in line
with the mind in the scene when testing
with Cinebench this time we're testing
with VRA the 3900 X was 5 percent faster
on the X 570 board while the 3700 X was
just 3 percent faster and we see the r5
3600 performing 1% better on the be 350
board so again within the margin of
error as for gaming performance the r5
3600 was again able to deliver the same
level of performance on both boards the
same was true for the 3700 X while the
3900 X dropped a few frames Assassin's
Creed Odyssey is a much more demanding
game on the CPU and here the 3100 X and
3700 X were 4 percent faster on the X
570 board while the 3600 saw a 1% FPS
difference
finishing up the benchmarks we have
total system power consumption while
running the blender tests the 39 her X
or total system consumption dropped by
10% 16% for the 3700 X and 11% for the
3600
there are likely a few reasons for this
the hyatt x5 70 motherboards might waste
more power due to their extreme verum
implementations we know the x5 70
chipset uses quite a bit more power as
well and
pods are generally littered with RGB
LEDs though the MSI creation is pretty
good in that regard either way it seems
AMD's enter CPUs are much more power
efficient on 300 and 400 series boards
okay so the good news for those of you
who own an entry-level am4 motherboard
is that they can easily handle the new
rise in five thirty six hundred thirty
six hundred X and horizon seven thirty
seven hundred X so no issues there with
perhaps the exception of questionable
memory support though that won't be
anything new for anyone who's running a
first or second generation part on
boards such as this and really even the
Raisa 930 900 X that worked perfectly
fine in its out-of-the-box configuration
just don't expect that you'll be able to
go overclocking the hell out of the 12
core CP on this board in fact just don't
go overclocking it at all and again
memory support on this particular be 350
motherboard was a little bit limited
ddr4 3200 but really that's all you need
to get the maximum performance anyway
from these rice and processors assuming
you're using a low latency memory and
honestly I don't believe riser 930 100x
support is relevant right now still
relevant but right now not so much in a
few years time where you can get the CPU
secondhand for what I'm guessing will be
around a hundred to two hundred dollars
then yeah getting one and sticking it on
a cheap be 350 boards such as this will
be a really nice option as for higher
end be 350 boards yet to test any of
those but I'm just going to assume that
those with beefier VRMs should be even
better assuming that the BIOS support is
there as for by our support we are
obviously in the really early days here
so the state of these older boards is
likely to improve as the BIOS is get
updated I'm not sure whether they will
update them any further there's not a
huge amount incentive for board partners
to do so obviously they want to sell
their newer boards but they have rolled
out updates so yeah maybe they will
continue to work on those we'll just
have to see there should be no real
performance differences or improvements
between the adjacent one 0 0 1 and 1 0 0
3 versions things like memory
compatibility they could be improved
along with stability in general but I'm
not expecting to see
the bias revisions make any real
difference to performance I am aware of
the challenges aim day and its board
partners faced with their backwards
compatibility promise
for example the storage capacity of the
SPI flash EEPROM chip that stores the
motherboard UEFI firmware it isn't
really big enough to house the latest GC
microcode and that is a problem for a
number of the entry-level and mid-range
boards that only use a 16 megabyte prom
the x5 70 boards they've been upgraded
to a 32 megabyte prom that's no doubt to
combat this compatibility issue moving
forward though they do drop support for
first gen parts anyway to try and work
around this issue as ROC has made a
light version of their BIOS that doesn't
feature any colors and it has a very
basic layout but anyway I'll be testing
more be 350 boards soon as well as some
of the cheaper X 370 boards and I'll be
looking at other brands such as MSI of
Susa and gigabyte on a final note that's
pretty much unrelated to the testing in
this video but I just want to make
mention of this issue here it's an issue
I was having with World War Z with the
Rison processors performance was well
down on where I was expecting it to be a
bit like what we see with Far Cry New
Dawn but there's no bug or issue there
so basically yesterday I was testing the
3100 X again just to make sure that all
the numbers were where they should be
and I went to fire at World War Z and
there was an 8 gigabyte patch so I
downloaded the patch installed it didn't
think too much of it then re ran the
tests and the performance was
significantly better than what I'd
reported in my reviews so that was a bit
of an issue I went back reconfirmed yeah
the rising performance is now very very
close to the night ok now this patch was
apparently released early last week so
about the time that I started testing
the Rison processors but for whatever
reason the epic store only updated my
copy on Monday now at this point I don't
know if the patch addressed rising
performance there's no mention of it in
the notes that I've been out of find so
if it doesn't address performance with
Verizon there was probably just
something wrong with my copy and the a
gigabyte patch just fixed that so I've
reached out to AMD to try to help me on
this one see if they can
find out what was going on I have seen a
few other reviewers that tested World
War Z and did get better results than me
so it seems they probably tested with
this updated Apache four did address
performance or yeah perhaps there was
just something wrong on my end in either
case I will be updating my results next
week at the moment I'm revalidating my
third gen rising numbers also go back
and just make sure 1st and 2nd gen parts
haven't changed and I'll do the same for
the Intel CPUs but I want to let you
guys know that I'm aware of this issue
and I am working to resolve it so yeah
sorry but it'll be fixed next week I
promise anyway I should wrap this video
up so I can go back to doing that
