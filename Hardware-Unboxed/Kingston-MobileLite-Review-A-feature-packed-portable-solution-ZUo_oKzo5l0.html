inevitable it went flat and I had to
plug it into the wall and well you know
the rest standard stuff we've all done a
million or so times in fact smartphone
charging become such a popular chore
that we've invented secondary devices
dedicated to none other than charging
our smart friends on-the-go power banks
as they're lovingly referred to allow us
to replenish our phone's battery
capacity when away from a wall socket
like when taking a leisurely walk in a
rain forest for example to see just how
popular power banks are search for the
words power bank on Amazon and enjoy
scrolling through 20 plus pages of
various size boxes 99% of which is
simply designed to keep your phone
running longer just the other day I was
on a long walk when the dreaded low
battery alarm sounded and I was supposed
to stop him without my power bank
problem solved right well yeah kind of
but then as I stood there throne and
power bank in hand I saw a rare mahogany
glider and I thought damn I have to get
a photo with this thing of course I
tried to take a quick snap on my phone
only to receive a memory fool error
I guess there's 200 shots at that
kangaroo who filled the internal storage
the glider took off and it was an
opportunity missed if only I had a way
to quickly back up the data on my phone
so I could continue to fill it with
low-quality photos that I probably won't
look at ever again then it hit means
just the other day I was reading a press
release for a new device that could
solve this very problem the curiously
named MobileLite Wireless probe from
popular memory maker Kingston could be
what I'm after the MobileLite Wireless
Pro is another power bank but it's not
just any ordinary power bank this is the
Swiss Army knife of power banks want to
charge your phone not once but twice at
maximum speed with a two amp output
access USB flash drives and SD cards
wirelessly perhaps make a backup copy of
important photos videos contacts and
calendar entries transfer files to a new
phone or tablet without using a PC
create a wireless access point from a
wired network or maybe connect
wirelessly to a PC or an SMB device or
file copy well check check check check
check check check
because Kingston has you covered armed
with 64 gigabytes of internal flash
storage
SD card reader for good measure the
MobileLite while SPRO is the perfect
mobile backup solution truth be told
this is more exciting than just to
backup devices it can be used to stream
media to a smartphone or tablet
wirelessly with support for 802 11 AC 5
gigahertz spectrum strangely there are
two apps for the MobileLite at least in
the Google Play Store they're quite
different in terms of user interface
with the blue ones seeming to be the
newer app from within both applications
I was able to easily stream 1080p video
from an SD card and it was fast and
smooth I also had some files on USB
drive but I have a lot of trouble
getting these files to appear in either
app copying files around between the
internal storage phone SD card and USB
Drive was reasonably straightforward and
file transfer speeds were to be as
expected a single light 4 gigabyte file
to just over 10 minutes while a
collection of randomly sized images
totaling 2 gigabytes took three minutes
and 50 seconds
overall the apps did do what they were
supposed to do for the most part and the
key file transfer functions and media
streaming worked well but as mentioned I
did have troubles getting files on our
USB stick to display and the settings
menu on the blue app seemed to just sit
there stuck loading the internal 64
gigabyte storage capacity is really nice
particularly given the reasonable $105
price tag of course you can easily
expand the internal storage with the SD
card reader which inserts the card
completely inside the unit so you can
leave it in there unlike USB thumb
drives which naturally stick out like an
appendage Kingston also provides a micro
SD card adapter in the package allowing
micro SD cards to be adapted to the SD
slot the device supports a wide range of
file systems which includes all the
facts along with NTFS which is nice for
those wanting to store large movies
onboard
additionally Kingston's provided a mini
USB charging cable so the MobileLite
Wireless Pro itself can be charged I
should point out that the package
doesn't actually include a wall charger
so you will have to use the one that
came with your phone or tablet you could
also charge from your PC though it could
take some time if it doesn't have a USB
port with a high current rating with the
MobileLite Wireless Pro you're of course
charging a 6700 milliamp hour battery
which I found provided enough juice to
fully charge my completely depleted
galaxy note 4 and still have enough left
over to almost repeat the exercise I
have to say charging a surprise
five thanks for that - and output when
not using the device for charging
Kingston says it has a runtime of up to
16 hours so streaming data and other
functions given the name you'd expect
this device to be both mobile and light
measuring 150 millimetres long 80
millimetres wide and just twenty four
millimeters deep and tipping the scales
of 194 grams
I believe the MobileLite Wireless
protects both boxes batteries are
claimed to feature premium Japanese
battery cells which kingston says
improves reliability and longevity
typically premium batteries also weigh a
bit more so the fact that Kingston kept
it under 200 grams is pretty impressive
along with the micro USB type a USB and
card reader there's also a wired LAN
port that allows the device to function
as an access point which is very cool
indeed I should also point out there's
also a cut-down version of the protocol
wireless g3 which sells for just 50
dollars and is surprisingly similar to
its bigger brother the key differences
being the battery which has been reduced
to a 5400 milliamp hour capacity and the
internal flash storage which has been
removed entirely I mean you use this
have to rely solely on an SD card so if
you don't acquire the internal storage
and the almost 20 percent smaller
battery isn't an issue then saving 50%
on the g3 would be a smart choice still
it has to be said for just $100 the
Kingston MobileLite Wireless Pro is
pretty good value for the functions it
provides I can see those that like to
travel light as in without a computer
and take and share photos amongst the
family getting the most use out of it
I'd like to see Kingston put together a
more robust and straightforward
application I suspect this is what
they've attempted to do with the second
blue mobile light up but for the time
being users can complete all functions
between the two available applications
as silly as that sounds thanks for
joining me again I'm your host Mann as
always and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
