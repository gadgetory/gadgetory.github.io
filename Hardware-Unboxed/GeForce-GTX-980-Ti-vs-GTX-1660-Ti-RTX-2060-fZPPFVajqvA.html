revisiting the geforce gtx 980ti cuz i'm
really keen to see how it stacks up
against the newly released RT x 2060 and
gtx 1660 TI particularly in newer titles
such as apex Legends Resident Evil 2 and
Far Cry new dawn for example of course
while the gtx 1660 TI features an MSRP
of just $200 u.s. and the RT x 2060 $350
us the 980 TI was much more expensive at
six hundred and fifty dollars still it's
a four year old GPU now so it expect
newer GPUs around half the price to
deliver a similar level of performance
whereas the 980 TI packs two thousand
eight hundred and sixteen CUDA cores the
RT X 2060 has 32 percent fewer cores and
the sixteen sixty TI 45 percent fewer
cores that said the chirring cores are
wider allowing them to execute more
instructions and they're also clocked
higher the Nvidia spec for the 980 TI
calls for a boost clock of 1075
megahertz and this gives the RT X 2060 a
56% clock speed advantage and then the
gtx 660ti a 65 percent clock speed
advantage the cheering GPUs are also
paired with higher clocked GDD are six
memory and this means while the RT x 26
t only has a 192 bit wide memory bus
opposed to the much wider 384 bit wide
bus of the 980 TI the faster memory
means it has the same 336 gigabytes per
second memory bandwidth then the 1660 Ti
has been downgraded to 288 gigabytes per
second with its 12 GB bits per second
memory but as we've already seen this
doesn't really hurt it earlier this year
I put together an in-depth use graphics
card buying guide and in it I found the
average selling price for the gtx 980ti
was 235 dollars u.s. and taking a quick
look today at completed eBay listings
that price still appears to be very
accurate so that then makes this
comparison all the more interesting
should you get the 980 TI for around
$235 us or buy a brand new GTX 1662 I
for $280 us to find out I have grabbed
our core I $9.99 ok test system
installed the 980 TI and spent
a few days getting through a 33 game
benchmark all testing takes place at
1440p and while I am using a reference
card it has been overclocked to 1100 and
90 megahertz and this allowed to hold a
typical boost clock of 1.3 gigahertz so
with that let's get into the results I'm
going to start with Metro Exodus as this
is the only game where I've included
these stock 980ti result the reason I've
done this is because rather than test
just a dozen or so games I wanted to aim
for at least a 30-something game
benchmark this gives us a much better
idea of how the Maxwell GPU stacks up
today and not just in the latest and
greatest games but also those released
over the last year I mentioned this
because for me to test such a massive
range of games it's not really feasible
to invest twice as much time to test it
well all over again so I had to pick
either the Nvidia spec or a really
aggressive factory overclock so I went
with the latter for the most part the
overclocked configuration offers 10%
more performance with gains as large as
15% seen under certain conditions for
example he when testing with Metro
Exodus we see at the overclock provided
a nine percent performance boost which
is decent
basically the 980ti goes from being
slightly sold the gtx 1070 to slightly
faster so I just wanted to provide this
data as a reference point make it clear
that the 980ti has been overclocked but
only as far as what you'd find on the
more premium higher and aib models such
as gigabytes gaming g1 for example the
overclocked 980 TI performs extremely
well and shut off the Tomb Raider
beating the gtx 1070 by a few frames to
come in just to FPS down on the 1660 TI
and 1070 TI moving on we find that Forza
horizon 4 is a good game to include in
this comparison as it utilizes modern
GPU architectures really well as such
the overclocked 980 I was only able to
match the Radeon rx 590 making it a
little over 10% slower on the 1660 TI
and RT x 2060 next up we have Just Cause
4 and here the gtx 980ti came in just
behind the gtx 1070 and 1660 TI
nothing that unusual about these results
so let's just move on firing up resin
evil 2 we see the overclocked 9
so he's able to roughly match the gtex
1662 I'm making at 16 percent slower
than the r-tx 2060 now testing with
hitman 2 we saw the 980 I was basically
matching the GTX 1662 I while it was 14%
slower than the r-tx 2060 and 16 percent
slower than Vega 56 so a pretty solid
result here for the old Maxwell flagship
GPU Fortnight uses the Unreal 4 engine
and this engine is fairly familiar with
the Pascal architecture here the
overclocked 980 I just edged out both
the gtx 1070 and 1660 TI to come in just
behind the gtx 1070 TI and it really
wasn't that much slower than the RT x
2060 it also beat AMD's vega 56 by a 6%
margin the 980 TI performs really well
relative to the pascal competition in
rainbow 6 siege being the 1070 by a few
frames to come in just behind the 1070
TI that censuring seems to perform
really well in this title and as such
the 980 TI was 10% slower than the 16 60
TI and 22 percent slower than the RG x
20 60 when testing with battlefield 5 we
set the overclocked 980 is on par with
the gtx 1070 and we also find much the
same when comparing it to the gtx 660ti
just a few frames in it there we also
see that the 980 TI was 14% slower than
a typical AIB version of the RT X 2060
not a massive margin but given that the
Maxwell GPU did come at an MSRP of $650
us the fact that we're now getting more
performance for just $350 us seems like
pretty good news though I suppose you
would at the very least expect this
given the RT X 2060 is 4 years newer
although it's gone through several major
upgrades World of Tanks
at its core is still a very old game now
that being the case it is well optimised
for older GPU architectures and as a
very popular title Nvidia has made sure
that ageing GPU still perform where they
should in the case of the 980ti that
means delivering GTX 1070 Ti light
performance making it 16% fast in the
1660 Ti in just 6 percent slower than
the ITX 2060 apex Legends is one of the
newest games we're testing with here and
as you can see the overclocked 980 I
falls just short of the gtx 1070 and is
quite a way behind the GTX 1662 I am
massively behind the r-tx 2060
in short the gap to Pascal isn't that
large but the more complex during
architecture provides a significant
performance uplift here especially if we
were to compare GPUs with a similar core
count the last game we're going to look
at closely is far cry new dawn and here
the overclocked 980 to I match the stock
gtx 1070 and 1660 TI with an average of
74 fps that said it was 15% slower than
the RT x 2060 though I'm not suggesting
that makes the budget RT X option a
worthwhile upgrade for a current 980ti
owner as a dozen okay so as we've found
time and time again in the past the gtx
980ti and gtx 1070 deliver basically the
same performance at the stock Nvidia
spec the 1070 is generally a little bit
faster and with both overclocked to the
max they're also much the same though I
think it's fair to say the 980 to I
generally does a little better overall
thanks to its huge degree of
overclocking Headroom for the most part
we found that the stock Vega 56 graphics
card beat the non HDI and overall the
old GeForce GPU was 7% slower on average
there were just five games with a 980 I
won by a 5% margin or greater but given
what you can typically get these things
for in the second-hand market they are
often a much better choice for budget
conscious buyers okay so time for the
gtx 1660 TI comparison and here we see
overall the 980 i was a whisker faster
edging out the budget cheering GPU by a
2% margin of course while we used a
stock MSI GTX 1662 a gaming X card the
980 TI was overclocked
that said you can only squeeze about 5
maybe 10% more out of the 1662 I anyway
so it's probably still going to lose
that comparison but it's still great to
see that we're finally getting 980ti
levels of performance for under $300
then finally of the RT x 2060 and even
with the overclock the 980 I just
couldn't hang with the stock 2060 on
average the flagship maxwell part was
12% slower but we see examples of it up
to
20 25 percent slower when looking at
Assassin's Creed Odyssey Rainbow six
siege Wolfenstein 2 and apex legends so
the once-mighty geforce gtx 980ti
has now been matched by a sub $300 GPU I
only took about four years I guess if
you did drop $650 us on a 980 - oh all
those years ago and you still have it
today gaming at 1440p then it's fair to
say you did get your money's worth of
course for such a person the GTX 1662
and r-tx 2060 simply won't warrant an
upgrade as that really would be more of
a side grade that said if you're a six
hundred and fifty dollar GPU kind of
shopper then it was unlikely these lower
tier mid-range offerings were ever going
to entice you for that you're probably
after a 90 X 20 80 and in titles such as
Metro Exodus you'd be looking at just
over a 60% performance boost so that's
obviously very significant now if you're
tossing up between buying a new gtx 1660
TI or a use 2 gtx 980ti that's a tough
one actually it's probably not really
well you could potentially save around
$50 by buying a 980 TI as i said the
typical selling price is $235 u.s.
there's always the possibility that you
might have to pay more than that for a
good model alternatively if you're
willing to buy add your time you might
manage to get one even cheaper there's a
bit of an actor buying secondhand but no
matter how good you are there are still
some unavoidable pitfalls
obviously the 980ti is an old product
now it was discontinued about three
years ago so it's extremely unlikely any
model you buy will still come with a
warranty so for me the risk for around a
$50 savings not seem worth it I'd be
wanting to save much closer to $100 u.s.
to take the plunge on a three to four
year old graphics card there's also the
issue of driver support without question
the gtx 1660 TI is going to age better
moving forward again the Maxwell
architecture is quite old now so you can
expect to see less time spent on driver
optimizations in the future overall I
have to say the gtx 980ti has aged very
well and today it's still capable of
delivering an enjoyable 1440p gaming
experience
but to justify buying one today you'd
have to be getting it for under $200
u.s. in my opinion anything more than
that I feel like the risk of buying
secondhand just isn't worth it
I feel like you're probably just better
off playing it safe and getting a shiny
new gtx 1660 TI and that is going to do
it for this one if you did enjoy the
