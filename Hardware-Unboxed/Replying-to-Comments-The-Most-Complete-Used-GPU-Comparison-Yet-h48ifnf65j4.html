two weeks ago now i put together the
first ever replying to comments episode
that was really well-received you guys
seem to enjoy it quite a bit and there
were loads a requests for more episodes
so i plan to create one every two to
three weeks depending on what content
we've got out and if there's anything
worth following up on
recently i released a video I'd been
working on for a little over a week
it was my used GPU comparison covering
about 60 different GPU models now that
video was extremely well received and I
can't thank everyone enough who liked
the video and took the time to leave a
nice comment I very much enjoy reading
all your comments and your feedback and
all that sort of stuff I wish I could
have responded to all of it but at least
I was able to read every last one so
again thank you very much appreciated
there were however a few comments that
stuck out and I felt warranted more of
an in-depth response so I've decided to
make another reply in the comments
episode so that I could do just that so
let's get into it right so as I said a
lot of you really liked the used GPU
comparison and I noticed a lot of
requests for the same sort of video but
with a focus on CPUs I really hate to do
you guys content a lot of the videos we
make our subscriber requests and so we
certainly appreciate your feedback
unfortunately though a CPU version I
don't really see how it's possible
basically use CPUs are significantly
more difficult to make this kind of
content for than used GPUs and there's
just a number of reasons for this
firstly you're not just buying the CPU
at least in most cases you're not just
buying the CPU I'm more often than not
secondhand shoppers are in need of not
just the Seaview but also the
motherboard and memory so it'd be more
of a platform comparison and with that
pricing just it can vary massively so
can availability and then the quality of
the parts that'll also vary quite a bit
as well then you have to take other
things into account such as overclocking
headroom power consumption platform
features security issues CPU features
and so on in the case that the GPU just
slots into a PCI Express slot on any old
system you might require one to two
external power connect
but that's about it so for CPUs I do
prefer to review them individually test
out their platforms and all that kind of
stuff and I do quite a bit of that each
year right now though I recommend most
of you
second-hand shoppers invest in well the
am for platform
there's loads of cheap first
generalising CPUs on sale and if you buy
a be 350 board you'll be able to take
advantage of these n2 processes that we
were released later in the year the only
recommendations I really make is I
personally would avoid the AMD FX range
like the plague as well as any really
old Intel CPUs even those cheap x58 Xeon
models just not worth the drawbacks
unless you can get them for basically
next to nothing anything has well or
newer from Intel is worth considering at
the right price but again I would
recommend focusing your attention on
cheep am for deals ok next up we have a
comment here from Andre and he pointed
out this is well it was a bit of an
opportunity miss let's say and that was
to sort the graphs by the cost per frame
honestly I had considered doing this in
fact I did actually do it I sorted the
graph by the cost per frame and had a
look at it but for me it didn't really
make sense it wasn't really the best way
to analyze the data even so this video
does give me a chance to include that
graph now the reason I didn't include it
in the original video is because while a
GPU might offer a low cost per frame
which is certainly good the actual
performance could well suck making it
pointless take the r7 265 for example it
offers the best cost per frame but you'd
be world's better off spending $22 more
on average on the 285 as it offers over
50% more performance and a significantly
better gaming experience we see that the
GTX 580 also ranks really well but you
wouldn't touch that thing with a 50 foot
pole the GTX 570 is in the same boat
here and there are a few others as well
anyway it's not a bad way to arrange the
data I just felt it would be less
confusing to the viewer only to show the
massive graph once and arranged by
performance makes it much easier for you
to locate a cost-effective GPU that will
deliver the kind of performance you deem
acceptable anyway certainly not a bad
suggestion and I appreciate the comment
and I hope
I was happy that I was now able to
provide that graph moving on for the
next series of comments I'm not going to
call anyone out as that's not really
necessary but it is an interesting it's
an interesting point of view so I
thought I would discuss it at least give
my two cents on it so a few people were
criticizing my choice of using the
medium quality settings at 1080p rather
than ultra one of the arguments I saw
was that reviewers test it's an EP
primarily using ultra quality settings
so using medium patent unrealistic
picture just on that note if I had a
dollar for every time one of these
arguments ended with words such as
misleading unrealistic or pointless I
have many more dollars than I do anyway
at its core it is a fair criticism and
believe me as someone who often tests PC
hardware
under various conditions with a wide
range of settings having to land on just
one yeah that's something I organized
over for quite some time before I got
benchmarking in the end I considered the
massive list of graphics cards quite a
few of them packed less than four
gigabytes of vram and many were around
six years old after all we're talking
about used graphics cards here not the
latest and greatest tech hell I don't
even review brand new entry-level or
budget GPUs with ultra quality settings
so it doesn't really seem right to do
that with half decade old hardware or
even older graphics cards moreover I
feel medium was highly realistic who's
honestly buying a GeForce 600 or 700
series graphics card and running with
the ultra quality preset enabled in
games such as battlefield or Tomb Raider
really ultra would have broken so many
of these GPUs completely skewed at the
cost per frame data meanwhile the medium
preset did nothing to hurt or skew the
cost analysis of the higher-end models
such as Vegas 64 and the GTX ten-eighty
for example having said let me know what
you guys think is medium the right
choice for this kind of content or next
time should I upgrade to high or even
the ultra quality settings I just
quickly hear a shout out to my man
Timmy Joe he makes videos on the
internet about PC parts he also picked
up an iron I'm 270x for $6 canadian
which is about $45 u.s. and that's $6
below the average selling price that we
found in december so he must know what
he's doing
if you haven't checked out Timmy Joey's
PC tech channel I recommend you do he's
a bit of a wild man and his contents
always a lot of fun something I did look
over was the fact that eBay often offers
5 10 or even up to 15% discounts to try
and entice buyers and they did a lot of
that in December because it's sort of
the holiday thing leading after
Christmas they try to move as much stuff
as they can on the platform
so yeah it explains why I was scratching
my head so much wondering why so many
graphics cards say the gtx 1050 i sold
for around $700 or even a little over
$700 but if you apply a 10% discount
then you're getting down towards $600
and then with a 15% discount you end up
below $600 so yeah not really a bad deal
after all also I should note that cannot
throw out my cost per frame numbers can
throw them out a little bit but given
the discounts were universal across all
graphics card sales it's probably not
having that much of an impact still
something to be aware of next time when
I do update this video and thank you
everyone who pointed it out yeah that
was a bit of an oversight on my behalf I
thought I've made another oversight when
exactly thought not sure about that one
and Patrick pointed out a bit of an odd
result the GTX 780 was better than or
really on par with the r9 290 and GTX
970 the 780 also knocked off the three
gigabyte GTX 1060 so yeah that didn't
seem quite right however I did go back
and I checked the results all over again
and no mistakes were made so it does
seem like the medium quality settings
really helps you out - the GTX 780 our
performance did get a bit crippled when
I went back and tested those tiles with
ultra was it horrible but it didn't
stack up nearly as well against the more
modern cards and then some of the other
cards like the r9 290 so this made me
think I need to start testing these
older GPUs at 1080p using two or three
different quality presets normally I
just use sort of an ultra or very high
quality preset so yeah something to
think about when I do the revisits of
the older graphics cards I also checked
out some other games for honor Forza
horizon 4 and even fortnight and again
found with media quality settings that
the 780 does really well so yeah very
interesting
okay so viewer
wicked a ribbon has a word of warning
for us and it's something I did consider
getting into with the used GPU guide but
in the end decided against it
I really just wanted to stay on topic
the core topic as much as I could and
that was just to focus on price versus
performance anyway his warning is to be
careful that buying graphics cards from
minors cryptocurrency miners we're not
talking about young children here he
purchased two rx 570s that came with
modified biases and he found this broke
driver support with newer drivers of
course it is possible to reflash
graphics cards so this isn't an end of
world type scenario but you do need to
be a little tech savvy as well as be
willing to deal with these potential
issues in the first place generally I
wouldn't really worry that much about
buying an X mining graphics card if you
can get one for a bug and then yeah I
would just go for that a secondhand
shopping is a risk period and I know
plenty of people who have bought cheap
mining graphics cards over the past few
years and they've had no issues
whatsoever of course if you are in a
position where you can test the card
before you buy for example you can drive
over at the sellers house place some
load under it in a game listen out for
things like excessive coil whine and
keep your eyes peeled for any artifacts
then ya suggest doing that that would
obviously be an ideal situation for
buying a secondhand product generally
though my own experiences buying
secondhand graphics cards have been very
good I scored a nice comment here from
ferns with a request to see behind the
scenes video showing the process of
making sort of the used graphics card
guide I have had these sorts of requests
before but honestly it it really is
extremely boring
yeah it's seriously boring it's about on
par with watching paint dry if I'm
honest our benchmarking itself is
extremely boring it's not really a it's
not a great spectator sport and then
looking at eBay listings over and over
again well that's that's torturous
that's that's really bad viewing so I
think I'll spare you guys the
behind-the-scenes video for this kind of
testing and analysis last comment this
one is from aku but I did see quite a
few comments like this so I thought it
was probably worth addressing so the
claim is that graphics card pricing is
very
volatile and the figures in the video
will be inaccurate by the time it's
released it's certainly true that PC
hardware pricing is volatile especially
for graphics cards that said the demand
from mining is over now and we've pretty
well settled into the RT X release
cycles so yeah it's not really shaking
things up there for the use market so
prices seem pretty steady now the prices
provided were based on the average
selling price in December in the case of
the gtx 1070 that figure was 248 dollars
u.s. I just tallied up the latest dozen
1070 sold on eBay over the past few days
and the average selling price came out
to 247 dollars u.s. so pricing seems
pretty consistent so far and I don't
expect the artex 26a to shake things up
much and if anything that will drive the
gtx 10:17 1070 TI and 1080 pricing down
so obviously that's a good thing for
buyers you can expect the next big
pricing checkup to come once a midi
release their next-gen mid-range GPUs
and that's expected to come sometime
later in the year and I think that will
do it for this episode of reply in the
comments again I seriously appreciate
the overwhelming a positive feedback on
that video everyone that stopped and
gave it a like and a comment and all
that thank you very much it was great to
read over all those comments and even
hear your thoughts and feedbacks and
suggestions ideas all that kinds of
stuff it was really cool and yet all
that great positive energy will
certainly help motivate me to do it all
over again
in three to six months from now whenever
it's required but yeah not looking
forward to it but since you guys
appreciate enjoy it so much I will get
through that one also coming up on the
channel in a few days I have a massive a
a truly massive benchmark comparison
between the RX 570 and GT x 1050 Ti and
many of you have pointed out that I've
been recommending the RX 570 for months
now but I haven't created an updated
benchmark all the stuff I have is quite
outdated so yeah since that is the case
I will be correcting it and that is
going to do it for this one if you
