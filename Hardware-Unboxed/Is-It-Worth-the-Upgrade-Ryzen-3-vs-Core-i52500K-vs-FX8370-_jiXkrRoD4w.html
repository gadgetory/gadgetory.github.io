three of the Rison three gaming
benchmark series unfortunately probably
will be the last video in this series at
least for now as I will be shifting
focus back to our X Vega after this and
then hopefully we will have Intel's
eighth generation desktop CPU series as
well so we'll get to do it all over
again anyway right now for your viewing
pleasure I have spent a few days slaving
away at the testbed testing some old
bangers one much-loved old banger and
one less loved let's put it that way
I'll let you work out which ones which
in a moment
contestant number one is Intel's Core i5
2500 K based on the architecture
codenamed
Sandy Bridge this is the second
generation core architecture and it was
released back in 2012 and to this day
it's probably Intel's most impressive
development in the last decade the 2500
K came in at two hundred and sixteen
dollars u.s. effectively replacing 2009
s core i5 750 truth be told the
difference between today's seventh
generation Core i5 7600 K and the 2500 K
isn't really that big when match clock
for clock it's certainly not nearly as
big as the five year age gap would
suggest even so many core i5 2500 K
owners have been asking me if it's time
to upgrade and does something like the
ultra affordable rise in three 1200
present as a suitable upgrade or is it
worth just spending a little more on say
the r5 1400 or maybe even something a
little more extreme then we have the if
nothing else resilient AMD FX owners
hats off to you guys for sticking it up
a hex if you have been asking me if you
have like an FX 4000 or 6000 or an 8000
series CPU what are the benefits of what
sort of bump in performance can you
expect if you were to upgrade horizon 3
that is assuming it is an upgrade at all
so I've taken the FX a 370 and I've
overclocked it a 4.4 gigahertz to try
and find out please note the core i5
2500 K has also been overclocked to the
same 4.4 gigahertz
this is probably considered to be more
of a mild overclock for these parts
especially the core i5 now for this
benchmark showdown harbor unboxed has
partnered with LastPass if you guys have
passwords and I'm sure you do but don't
know what LastPass is well let me tell
you your life could be made much easier
we all know that you shouldn't reuse the
same password on multiple sites for
security reasons but it can be hard to
remember so many different passwords so
sometimes it's easy to just get lazy
with LastPass you don't have to write or
remember any passwords they can generate
a unique password for every website
store it securely in the cloud and order
I fill it in to websites to make your
life much easier and so much more secure
the really cool thing about last parts
reaching out to partner up is the fact
that I've actually been using this
service for many years now and all the
staff over at tech spot do as well I
found it to be a real lifesaver when
having to share passwords among multiple
staff members the last thing you want to
do is transmit a password via email or
instant messaging and this is why
LastPass allows users to easily and
safely share passwords with other
LastPass accounts for more information
please check the link in the video
description
big thanks to LastPass for partnering
with us on this now it's time for the
benchmarks here's a look at the test
system specs and a few quick notes on
what we're doing here so once again
we're testing nine games at 1080p using
the geforce gtx 1060 1070 and 1080 the
core i5 2500 kane FX 83-70 have been
overclocked to 4.4 gigahertz while the
horizon 3 1200 and Rison 5 1400 have
been clocked at four-year Hertz
meanwhile the locked pentium g 45 60
will be operating at its default clock
speed of 3.5 gigahertz as you can't
overclocked locked CPUs right to the
benchmarks first up we have battlefield
1 and let's start with the geforce gtx
1060 results here every cpu with the
exception of the FX 83-70 were able to
max out the 1060 I found previously the
FX series really struggle from
battlefield 1 and here frame drops are a
common occurrence the core i5 2500 K on
the other hand had no trouble matching
the rise in CPUs though neither did the
G 4560
moving to the gtx 1070 we see at the
pentium g 4560 starts to fall behind and
interestingly the FX 83-70 is able to
pull ahead now though the old AMD cpu
does still trail the risin and core i5
2500 k CP use by a noticeable merge and
still with the 1070 performance doesn't
look bad using a more powerful GPU on
the GTX 1080 we start to see a real
weakness in the FX 83-70 and shockingly
this eight core 4 module CPU however you
want to word it struggles to beat the
dual core pentium g 4560 meanwhile on
average the 2500 k delivered 28% more
frames with the GTX 1080
the 2500 K even edged out the r3 1200
providing a few extra frames and wasn't
much slower than the r5 1400 this here
is exactly why so many have so much love
for the 2500 K and of course even its
bigger brother for 2600 K next up we
have f1 2016 and some more interesting
results to go over here so again even
with the gtx 1060 and still the FX 83-70
struggles to extract the maximum
performance and falls a few frames
behind the pack it's not really a big
deal that is until you install something
with a bit more oomph something like the
gtx 1070 for example here the FX AE 370
hits the same 55 FPS minimum as the
pentium g 45 60 though the average frame
rate was 14% lower now you might think
with a tighter margin between the
minimum and average frame rates that the
FX 83-70 provided a smoother experience
but no I can let you know that wasn't
the case meanwhile the core i5 2500 came
matched the Rison 3 1200 and the risin
fire 1400 in what was a very impressive
display spitting out 94 FPS on average
the 2500 K wasn't done yet either onto
the GTX 1080 and we see the 2500 K
actually pulls ahead of the Reisman CPUs
with a minimum frame rate of 87 fps so
if you have an overclocked to 2500 K and
you play f1 2016
I'd probably hold off an upgrading to a
current generation sub $200 CPU Far Cry
primal is a heavily GPU bound game even
so the FX 83-70 still manages to stand
out like a sore thumb
tell always seems to have a bit of an
advantage in this title so it's probably
not hugely surprising the pentium g 4560
outclasses the FX 83-70 every step of
the way the 2500 K also gives the rise
in CPUs a really hard time and with a
fairly sensible configuration using
something like the gtx 1070 horizon 3
1200 at 4 gigahertz still couldn't keep
pace total Wawa hammer is a destroyer of
CPUs though this time the FX 83-70 does
hang in there pretty well with the G 45
60 that said even with the GTX 1060
handling the rendering work the R 3 1200
was 20% faster than the FX chip so a big
upgrade there that's a we've seen
multiple times out the core i5 2500 K
hangs in there really well in fact once
we increase the GPU power with the gtx
1070 the 2500 k is now seen matching the
rising v 1400 making it a little bit
faster than the r3 1200 meanwhile the FX
83-70 is still stuck averaging around
60fps along with the g 4560 we've pretty
much cpu-bound
even with the gtx 1070 so upgrading
something more powerful like the GTX 280
really offers nothing extra here for
playing the popular overwatch
first-person shooter we find those
rocking a GTX 1060 or slower will be
served very well by any of these CPUs or
push well over 100 FPS at all times
moving to the gtx 1070 shook things up a
little though interestingly FX 83-70
still manages to stick with the rising 3
1200 and turns in a very impressive 185
FPS average the 2500 K was faster again
though not by much this time meanwhile
the arisin v 1400 was able to boost the
minimum frame rate by 12% over the 2500
K then with the GeForce GTX K we find
what looks to be the limits of the FX
83-70 the minimum frame rate was
increased quite a bit though the average
frame rate was much the same this means
when using more powerful GPUs the Rison
3 CPU will offer a little more Headroom
in this title The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt is
mostly a GPU bound game in our testing
even at 1080p please note that I am
using the maximum in-game quality
settings which does include hair works
using the GTX 1060 we see much the same
performance on all 5 CP
use it was also a similar story with the
gtx 1070 though the g 45 60s minimum
frame rate does slip behind here then
with the GT x 1080 installed the rise in
cpus along with the 2500 k are able to
get the most out of this high end GPU
next up we have Rainbow six siege and
here we have some very competitive
performance using the geforce gtx 960
performance is much the same though the
horizon 3 and Rison 5 cpus do deliver
the best minimum frame rates even with
the geforce gtx 1070 performance remains
quite similar across the five CPUs
tested we do see some variance here and
the pentium g 45 60 and FX 83-70 are
starting a lag behind meanwhile the 2500
k matched the r5 1400 average frame rate
but did dip slightly lower from the
minimum movie to the GTX 1080 we saw
further performance gains with all five
processors though the G 45 60 didn't
really have much more to give she's
really given it all she's got captain
I'll see myself out
actually there are a few more things I
would like to note here before
commencing the walk of shame you might
have noticed although the FX a 370 is
now averaging a hundred and fifty-four
FPS we still saw frame dips down to 118
fps and that made the FX CPU much slower
than the 2500 K and rise in CPUs World
of Tanks it really isn't that demanding
on the CPU or the GPU that said the FX
83-70 makes it look like a real chore
even with the GTX 1060 I realize that
we've seen some pretty poor performances
from the FX series but I was really
surprised by how average it does here
creative we are pushing over 100 FPS at
all times but when compared to the
competition it really does just putt
along we see that the FX 83-70 finds its
limits with the gtx 1060 and that's how
these really all she's got on this one
how we find the same performance with
the gtx 1070 and gtx 1080
meanwhile the g 45 60 does max out with
the gtx 1070 and it's really much the
same situation with the risin and Core
i5 CPUs World of Tanks favors single
thread performance or at least frequency
and this hands the core i5 2500
slight performance advantage in this
title wrapping up the benchmarks we have
Counter Strike global Offensive and like
World of Tanks strong single thread
performance really counts for a lot here
as a result the core i5 2500 cables
really strong of course it does only
match the minimum frame rate of the
horizon 3 and rising 5 CPUs don't seem a
bit odd zhuang only but that's because
the average is at least 8 percent higher
with the gtx 1070 and 1080 alright so
we've checked out how these CPUs compare
in 9 strategically selected games using
a range of different tiered graphics
cards the point of this comparison was
to see what kind of upgrade Rison 3
might provide those still gaming with a
much older AMD FX or Intel Core i5 2500
k processor
I am generalizing with the FX a 370 here
as it is the flagship model and it
really will cover all the lower tiered
FX processors as well so let's start
with the FX 83-70 results and again this
information really applies for anyone
using the am-3 platform in general they
all are unlocked parts in the FX 83 70s
really the flagship model excluding the
8000 series but they're just super
power-hungry and not many people bought
them so yeah it'll really cover anyone
using that platform so in my opinion the
Rison 3 it will offer a solid upgrade
pretty much any FX series owner of
course how much of an upgrade it will
really depend on two things the games
you play and what kind of graphics card
you're using with a graphics card that's
equivalent to say the geforce gtx 1060
or of course slower for most games the
gains will be quite slim that's that if
you play titles such as Counter Strike
global Offensive total war Warhammer or
even World of Tanks then you will see a
noteworthy gang with the gtx 1060 the
games will be even greater for those
using an FX 6000 or 4000 series cpu as
the GPU power increases there's a good
chance arise on three will make
noticeable performance improvements so
if you plan to get yourself a gtx 1070
or maybe a custom board partner vega 56
card in a few months time then I highly
recommend switching to rise and three of
course the good news here with this
upgrade option is that you can still
increase the CPU power
quite substantially down the track by
getting a six core even an eight core
Eisen CPU for a reasonable price
or you could quite possibly even get a
second-generation Rison CPU of course
once they're released so in short if I
was still suffering with an AMD FX
series CPU I'd be jumping on the rising
bandwagon faster than you could call me
a fanboy as for the core i5 2500 K well
that CPU simply refuses to die it's the
little engine that could and by the
looks of it always will if you're 2500 K
owners still holding out for a
cost-effective upgrade well keep waiting
unless you're jumping to a modern core
i7 or maybe the Rison 5 1600 the gains
simply aren't there to justify the
upgrade there really were very few
instances where the 2500 K trailed the
horizon CPUs and when it did if the
margins they really were very small
having seen what we've seen here I'm now
really keen to do an in-depth 2500 K
revisit and compare it to CPU such as
the r5 1600 and i5 7600 ok maybe once
I'm done with all this Vega testing
that's something I'll look into finally
a few side notes if you want to see how
rise on three stacks up against
higher-end CPUs please just check the
day 1 review as I've covered all that
there there's a heap of different CPUs
compared to Rison 3 so it'll give you an
idea of how thing stack up also for
price versus performance data please
check the previous video in this series
I'll throw the link in the video
description to both the videos just
mentioned there wasn't much point doing
the price versus performance stuff in
this because we're testing five-year-old
CPUs you can no longer purchase a new
anyway also for power consumption
figures again please check the day one
rise and three review all that
informations there that said though the
data for the 2500 KFX 83-70 won't be
found there
in short the 2500 k is still very fuel
efficient even by today's standards
whereas the FX 83-70 will lead up polar
bear territory faster than you can say
global warming well that's going to do
it for this one guys I hope you've
enjoyed this benchmark series it was a
heap of effort but I think it was well
it's really worth it I personally really
enjoyed seeing how everything's stacked
up and all the different scenarios we
look
that we've pretty much checked out rise
and threes gaming performance room just
about every angle possible now so
potential buyers should have a good idea
of what they're getting as always stay
tuned because later this week I have a
massive 30 game benchmark video looking
at Vega 56 64 + 64 liquid-cooled
and they will be compared to custom
board partner and found Edition models
of the gtx 1070 and 1080 it's going to
be epic
I'm your host Steve see you again soon
guys
you
