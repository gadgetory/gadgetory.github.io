calm design your own custom snap backs
and hats welcome back to the hardware
box news corner not feeling quite as
sick today which is good news because
there's loads of news to cover including
Spector hitting Intel hard once again a
new GTX 1050 variant a few bits of game
news and more let's talk about the new
gtex 1050 variant first up because it's
probably a bit more interesting than
first appears the verge is being called
the geforce gtx 1053 gigabyte as opposed
to the original 2 gigabyte model however
it differs from the original in more
than just gddr5 memory capacity in fact
the coup de coeur count rob count clock
speeds and memory bus have all changed
as well which just adds confusion to the
situation so the original gtx 1050 is a
cut down version of invidious GP 107 die
featuring 640 cuda cores the gtx 1053
gigabyte however has 768 cuticles the
same as the gtx 750ti however unlike the
1050 Ti we're looking at a 96 bit memory
bus and potentially just 24 drops which
is lower than the 128 bit bus and 32
Rob's you get with both the 1050 Ti and
original 1050 perhaps to compensate for
this the core clock speed has been
raised higher than both the 1050 and
1050 Ti to 1392 megahertz with a
readyboost clock of 1518 megahertz in
short the three gig variant of the gtx
950 has more memory but less memory
bandwidth it also has a raised core
count to match the gtx 750ti and a
higher clock speeds in the 1050 Ti yet
fewer rocks
according to Nvidia this new gtx 1053
gigabyte is roughly 10% faster than the
original 2 gig model and while there's
no exact price it should be available
soon in the same price bracket as the
1050 and 1050 Ti now I have a problem
with the gtx 1053 gigabyte it has a
really stupid name and it joins a long
list of graphics cards released by both
nvidia and AMD in the past few years
with names that just confuse customers
names like the
1063 gigabyte the GT 10:30 with ddr4 the
MX 151 d12 the RX 560 16 and 14 cu
models all of these are really dumb
often these cards mess with more than
just the memory configurations listed in
their names and that just makes it
harder for consumers to know what they
are buying it really isn't that hard for
these companies to create a unique
product name for each of their graphics
cards that easily identifies where the
cards lie in the product stack Nvidia is
already using a numbered naming scheme
yet they've just chosen not to use it
for cars like the GTX and 53 gigabyte
just annoying stuff really and it only
does a disservice to buyers let's move
on to talk about the latest spectre
vulnerability starting with Spectre
variant four or Sivir year 2018 36:39
this particular four is part of the
Spectre mg family that was discovered
after the original set of Spectre issues
earlier this year as you might expect
Spectre v4 also exploits speculative
execution and through the use of a side
channel an attacker could potentially
read privileged data across trust
boundaries the floor it's also known as
speculative store bypass or SSB Spectre
variant for effects most CPU vendors
including Intel AMD arm and more just
like with previous Spectre issues all
CPU manufacturers are working on patches
and mitigation for this issue and it
appears Intel is the hardest hit their
firmware level patch has led to a
performance impact of approximately two
to eight percent based on overall scores
for benchmarks like sis mark 2014 ASC
and speck integer rate on both client
and server test systems this patch will
be released through om system
manufacturers and supported through OS
software updates in the coming weeks
AMD isn't as effective they are
mitigating SSP through an operating
system update for products going back to
bulldozer the windows patch is in the
final stages of testing and validation
while Linux patches are in development
early testing from fir onyx on Linux
suggests these software level patches
have little performance impact
interestingly both AMD and Intel are
recommending the patch respectively for
be left disabled by default based on the
difficulty to exploit this vulnerability
this means that at least on Intel
systems you will only experience
performance if you specifically enable
the patch for extra protection the other
recently disco inspector flaw is dubbed
variant 3a or CBE 2018 3640 otherwise
known as rogue system register read or
RSR ii of the two main cpu vendors AMD
claims they have not discovered any
products of theirs affected by this
floor whereas intel are affected
luckily the patch rectifying is for has
no performance impact on Intel
processors this story probably won't
come as a surprise but Nvidia and SK
Hynix have struck a deal to use G DDR 6
memory on upcoming graphics products
it's not clear whether this memory will
be ready in time for NVIDIA set of cards
scheduled for release or later this year
or whether it be used across the product
stack but SK Hynix the stock did jump by
6 percent when the deal was announced
currently SK Hynix offers eight gigabit
GDD are six chips supporting fourteen
gigabit per second at one point three
five volts or twelve gigabit per second
at one point two five volts the top 14
gigabit per second option is a fair bit
faster than current gddr5 X memory that
tops out around 11 gigabit per second
considering the price of
high-performance memory I reckon we'll
see GDD r 6 appear first in high-end
cards in place of gddr5 X and as an
alternative to the extremely expensive
HBM tube though you know with all these
sort of rumor type stories who really
knows at this point it feels like I've
been covering the story of 4k 144 Hertz
g-sync HDR monitors every week for the
past few weeks now but hopefully this is
the final time I have to mention them on
this new show and that's because this
week both ASA and the suits
finally finally have announced these
miners with a proper release date and
pricing the Acer predator X 27 will ship
on June 1st with a 1999 dollar price tag
while the sous rog swift PG 27 u q will
be available later in June also for
around that two thousand dollar mark in
case you're wondering about Australian
pricing the sous told me their monitor
will cost four thousand four hundred
ninety nine dollars and yes that's not a
mistake a u.s. two thousand dollar
product will cost four and a half
thousand dollars here which is pre
outrageous but I guess Bach Institute
anyway both moons
is the same a Optronics 3840 by 2160 hv
a panel with a 144 hertz refresh rate a
thousand it's of peak brightness and 384
f a LD backlighting zones it's also
quantum dot enhanced with 96% coverage
of the DCI p3 gamut they support g-sync
HDR as well for a combination of
adaptive sync and HDR at the same time
Razer this week announced a new blade
laptop and a new core X Thunderbolt 3
GPU enclosure the blade in particular
looks pretty cool with a refined design
slimmer bezels and a whole host of new
hardware the CPU is upgraded to Intel's
Core i7
8750 H and on the GPU side you get
either an nvidia geforce gtx 1060 max Q
or a gtx 1070 max q depending on how
much money you want to spend ram varies
from 16 to 32 gigabytes and SSD options
start from 512 gigabytes plus there's an
80 watt hour battery inside as you'd
expect from a raised laptop the new
blade is quite expensive it starts at
1,900 bucks for the GTX 1060 max Q
braids and 2,400 bucks for the gtx 1070
max q it'll be interesting to see where
the raises thermal solution has improved
along with this new design it's the
cooler ran a bit hot and loud on
previous generations of this laptop and
that was just with a four core CPU
inside the razor core X is a new version
of the core that comes in at a far more
reasonable price point the core v2 cost
a ludicrous 500 bucks for what other a
GPU enclosures were offering for around
300 bucks so the new core X is priced at
a much more reasonable $2.99 it has a
650 watt PSU inside up from the 500 watt
unit in the core v2 so we can now
support even more powerful graphics
cards when they exist there's also a
redesigned cooling solution that swaps
out five smaller fans for just one 120
millimeter fan however you do lose USB
and Ethernet connectivity in favor of
just Thunderbolt three for connecting to
your device of choice my previous model
the graphics card is not included
cryo rig is set to show up there
frostbit m2 SSD cooler at Computex
this is kind of this strange product
considering SSDs don't typically need to
be cooled but here we are with the dual
heat pipe cool affair Emre two SSDs with
a total dissipation capacity of 12 watts
it's not an active cooler so you still
need some airflow for the best cooling
performance
I guess choir rig thinks that some fins
on an SSD are better than none and you
made the design of this cooler even
allows for adjustment so the cooler
doesn't obstruct our graphics cut if the
MDOT two slot is located near the
primary PCIe slot the design also
doesn't interfere with the standard
mounting points for 2280 size drives
anyway we'll hear more about this at
Computex where cryo rig will unveil the
price and availability moving into the
quicker topics now and this is just a
quick PSA that the steam spring sale is
currently on if you want to add another
50 games to your library that you will
never play now is the perfect chance
next up and I'm sure a lot of you would
have seen this announcement from a few
days ago already EA has officially
announced battlefield 5 for an October
release interestingly there's a
staggered launch for this game with that
first coming out on Origin access on
October 11 then for deluxe edition
buyers on October 16 and finally for
standard edition owners on October 19
it's set in world war 2 there is a woman
on the cover and as a playable character
which certainly rustled a few jimmies
there is no premium past this time
around so all map updates in the future
will be free and there's also no loot
boxes however there will be
microtransactions for cosmetic items PC
gamer has a great article the details
everything announced so far about the
game and there's a few interesting
changes to some of the gameplay
mechanics compared to battlefield 1 so
if you want to know more you should just
go over and check out their article more
will be revealed at EA play in June NZXT
has released the H 580 500 I cases the H
500 is the more basic of the two with a
simple exterior and tempered glass side
panel of course you can't go without
tempered glass in 2018 there's a
removable front bracket to make it easy
to install up to a 280 mm meter radiator
and you get two 120mm fans included with
the case the H 500 is largely the same
but it also includes NZXT smart device
which is a fan and RGB lighting control
hub the case comes with two
pre-installed RGB LED strips and also a
vertical graphics card mount which are
not included with the H 500 they're a
riser cable for the GP you will need to
be bought separately both cases should
be available in early June the H 500
price 70 bucks and the H 500 I at a
hundred bucks final news topic of the
week some Samsung
two LED TVs from their 2018 lineup have
received a firmware update that
introduces free sync support if you have
a q6 f NQ 7 f NQ 8 f NQ 9 FN or the Nu
8000 update the firmware version 1103 to
get free sync through the game mode in
the menu this will be particularly
useful if you have a gaming PC hooked up
to your TV or have an Xbox one which
will soon be updated to support free
sync
