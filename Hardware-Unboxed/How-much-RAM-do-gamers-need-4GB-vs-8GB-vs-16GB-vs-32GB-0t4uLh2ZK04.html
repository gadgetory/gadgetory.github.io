we're looking into how much ram you need
to play the latest and greatest gaming
titles with a nice silky smooth frame
rates it's about this time each year
that I do sit on a memory capacity
related quest last year I concluded by
saying the following a gigabyte should
be the minimum standard while 16
gigabyte is desirable but not needed for
general usage and gaming there is no
advantage to be had by using 16 gigabyte
or more RAM I suspect a year later this
still holds true but we have seen a few
games recently sneaking past 8 gigabytes
of allocated memory so I thought it was
probably worth looking into again I have
to say though there was one comment I
noticed from last year's written article
that does sting a bit today that comment
being a system memory has hit new lows
in 2016 which makes it very accessible
even in budget builds well yeah that's
no longer the case so I suspect those of
you with 8 gigabytes of memory that do
feel that they have to upgrade will
probably just wait till later next year
when pricing comes down hopefully comes
down when it comes to games testing the
impact of memory or RAM capacity is no
easy task and there are many factors at
play here before we get into the results
I would like to just discuss a few of
the challenges faced when doing this
kind of testing the first and possibly
biggest challenge is picking the right
hardware now what kind of graphics card
you use can very much influence the
amount of memory that you'll need for
smooth gameplay likewise the speed of
your storage device can also impact the
end result for example the GTX 1063
gigabyte will often see higher system
memory usage than the 6 gigabyte model
as at times you will run out of vram and
as a result system memory will be used
if you then happen to run out of system
memory some game assets are moved to
local storage this means something like
a hard drive or hopefully an SSD and
depending on how fast that device is and
how heavily it's hit with data you may
on
may not see a noticeable dip in
framerate so testing with a geforce gtx
980ti on its 11 gigabyte via round
buffer along with a super snappy nvme
SSD probably isn't the best way to
determine how much just in memory your
average gamer will require I'd also
assume that if you have a $700 US
graphics card and potentially a primary
storage device of similar value and
buying 16 gigabytes or more of system
memory or Ram probably isn't really a
big issue there are other factors to
consider as well for example memory
speed can also influence the results I
granted even the fastest memory I
think's a ddr4 4000 that can't make up
for a lack of capacity not entirely but
in some instances when working with
large volumes of say broken up data it
can help to avoid slowdowns as the data
is moved in and out of the system memory
much quicker the quality settings used
in games can also really impact the
results if you use a GeForce GTX 1063
gigabyte for example but are happy to
turn things down like textures it's a
sort of like a medium type quality
setting that will reduce how much data
is offloaded to the system memory taking
all of this into account I've tested a
number of different hardware
configurations and I'll be showing the
impact that all this has on performance
however I quickly discovered another
issue when trying to show the FPS
difference between the various hardware
configurations
now benchmark passes typically lasts
anywhere from say 30 to 60 seconds
depending on how the benchmark tests and
generally they are based on multiple
runs all the benchmarking on harbor and
box for example is based on a three run
average this means the system does have
a chance to cache the pass by keeping
just the data we're accessing over and
over again in that thirty to sixty
second pass and I can store that in high
speed and memory so while the results
for the very first run might see a
shockingly low 0.1% or 1% frame time
figure when using a limited amount of
system memory this result can be
improved dramatically on the second run
and then again on the third so
displaying a three run average here can
be quite misleading
the best solution that I came up with to
work around this problem was to run each
benchmark once then reset the entire
system load the game again and then run
the next pass the result being that the
30-second pass for each test doesn't
have the chance to be cached the
benchmark pass is actually 60 seconds in
total but I only report the frame rates
for the last 30 seconds and this mimics
more what you'd see when playing the
game for the first say initial 5 to 10
seconds the game can still be loading
assets as you play and this can cause
frame drops even on computers with
sufficient system memory
finally benchmarks are cite a good
indicator of working at how much memory
you'll need to play the latest and
greatest titles it's just to monitor
memory allocation this probably isn't
something that you can really do because
if you only have 8 gigabytes you can't
monitor if the games going to use more
than that because it just gets move to
the page file but for me I can install
in this case 32 gigabytes of memory and
we can see how much of that each of
these games will use to see if you do
need up to 32 gigabytes it's not a
foolproof method but it does give us a
pretty good idea of how much system
memory a game will require to avoid any
slowdowns again the hardware used will
impact the amount of system memory used
so having said a lot I'm first going to
show you memory usage using three
different graphics cards and a few
popular modern titles all game play
tests were conducted on the core i7 87
are ok with 32 gigabytes of ddr4 3000
memory and by using a large memory
buffer we can see how much system memory
each game and hardware configuration can
use when it's not limited by how much
system memory you have or not heavily
limited and this isn't a completely
sanitized test system either there are
many applications running in the
background such as steam origin you play
there's discord Chrome with a few tabs
open MSI Afterburner rivatuner and fraps
and all these applications are open with
the same amount of tabs or whatever open
for every single test so as I said this
is by no means a completely clean test
system running a skeleton crew of
applications and processes also please
note that the maps used to
test each game aren't the same every
time we're just testing multiplayer and
I did a lot of different map testing and
stuff so I'm just grabbing some random
footage to show you what I saw for the
most part starting with a 64 player
battlefield one match using the geforce
gtx 1080i at 1440p with the ultra
quality preset we see that up to eight
point two gigabytes of system memory is
being used the system page file grows to
11.6 gigabytes in size and at this
resolution and quality settings sees 3.8
gigabytes of vram consumed the 1080 TI
though does of course have an 11
gigabyte via ram capacity so this does
suggest for perfectly smooth performance
in this title gamers will require 16
gigabytes of system memory dropping down
to the geforce gtx 1066 gigabyte
graphics card under the same test
conditions we see that ram usage picked
a little higher at 8.5 gigabytes and the
system page file grew ever so slightly
to 12 gigabytes again we're seeing
around 3.6 gigabytes worth of VRAM
allocation now if we use a graphics card
with a VRAM buffer that's smaller than
the amount of memory the game wants to
allocate this happens with the geforce
gtx 1063 gigabyte we see ram usage hit
10 gigabytes while the page file grows
to 12 and a half gigabytes as a result
we did occasionally see dips in the
framerate that said for the most part
the game was still quite smooth and very
playable thanks to the fact that we do
have a massive 32 gigabytes of system
memory installed but whereas you might
have gotten away with a gigabytes using
a gtx 1080i you most certainly will
require 16 gigabytes with the graphics
card sporting less than a full gigabyte
frame buffer that said the three
gigabyte 1060 is really intended for
1080p gameplay but even lowering the
resolution at a EP still sees ram usage
peak at nine point seven gigabytes even
though for the most part the games only
allocating around 2.6 gigabytes of VRAM
for the rest of the games I'll just
quickly summarize what I saw
for player unknowns battlegrounds the
gtx 1080i saw seven point five gigabytes
of system memory used and throughout my
testing at 1440 peas in the ultra
quality preset the vram peaked at 6.2
gigabytes
this meant with the
to you by 1060 round allocation did
climb to 8.3 gigabytes and the page file
also grew a bit to 14 and a half
gigabytes but then with the three
gigabyte version of the gtx 1060 ram
allocation boiled over to 12 gigabytes
and reducing the resolution to 1080p
didn't help as we still hit 12 gigabytes
on the system memory now for the
ultimate memory pick Call of Duty World
War 2 using the extra quality settings
at 1440p we see the gtx 1080i VRAM usage
picks at 10.8 gigabytes and that's
pretty much maxed out and we saw the RAM
allocation hit 10 gigabytes Wow
interestingly RAM usage with the gtx
1066 gigabyte was much the same as was
the page file size the comparison though
unfortunately wasn't made on the same
map but I did try multiple maps and I
did see similar usage even with a three
gigabyte GTX 1060 which was tested on
the same map as the GTX 1000 we do see
similar system memory usage but frame
drops were much more apparent now
dropping down at 1080p didn't really
seem to help either
game is using a three gigabyte 1060
we'll need to lower the quality settings
things like texture quality will need to
be lowered from the extra that we have
it on to something less demanding maybe
normal would be more appropriate here
moving on we have overwatch and this is
a hugely popular and very high quality
game even if it's not super higher
quality in terms of visuals and textures
here we see at 1440p the GTX 1080 I only
saw up to 2.4 gigabytes of VRAM usage
while the system memory hit just 6.9
gigabytes so 8 gigabytes of RAM will be
fine for this hardware configuration in
overwatch we do see similar usage
patterns with the gtx 1066 gigabyte
system memory usage peaked just 7
gigabytes so again 8 gigabytes of ram
will work well here for this title that
said the 3 gigabyte 1060 you are pretty
much right on the edge ram allocation
did hit seven and a half gigabytes in my
test and we did see much the same at
terry p as well finally i monitored
system memory usage when playing star
wars battlefront 2 and no i didn't get
any extra system memory in a
loot box using the gtx 1080i at 1440p
with the maximum in-game quality
settings system memory usage hit 9.2
gigabytes so this is yet another title
that will want 16 gigabytes of system
memory
oddly dropping down to the six gigabyte
gtx 1060 reduced memory allocation to a
peak of eight and a half gigabytes I did
retest this a few times and found the
same result each time that said though
with the three gigabyte 1060 ram
allocation shot up to ten and a half
gigabytes so with this graphics card you
will certainly want sixteen gigabytes of
system memory even at 1080p usage still
rows above ten gigabytes okay so we've
looked at how much system memory a few
of the more popular games released this
year are using with three different
graphics cards what I want to compare
now is the GeForce GTX 1063 gigabyte and
six gigabyte graphics cards to see how
they compare with four gigabytes eight
gigabytes 16 gigabytes and 32 gigabytes
of RAM again I'm using a core i7 a 700 K
and the memory speed and timings are the
same for each capacity the only major
difference being that I was forced to
test the 4 gigabyte capacity with a
single 4 gigabyte stick and this meant
using single channel memory I don't have
2 gigabyte ddr4 memory modules and since
I already know that 4 gigabyte isn't
enough to play these games I didn't
really want to waste any money or time
trying to acquire a dual channel kit but
still be aware that the 4 gigabyte
capacity is tested in single channel
mode first up we have Assassin's Creed
origins and these results were recorded
using the very high quality preset at
1080p starting with the geforce gtx 1066
gigabyte we see that the 16 gigabyte and
32 gigabyte memory configurations allow
for maximum performance to be extracted
in this title interestingly while the
same average framerate is achieved with
8 gigabytes we see a noteworthy drop in
the frame time performance up to a 10%
drop can be seen then unsurprisingly
with just 4 gigabytes of system memory
the game completely tanks and although
the average frame rate looks good the
game is now very stuttery as indicated
by the 0.1% result similar performance
trends are seen in this title with the 3
gigabyte 1060 so
I though the impact to the a gigabyte
configuration has on performance is less
severe I was expecting to farm the
opposite anyway we are saying that for
maximum performance you will want 16
gigabytes while 8 gigabytes is
definitely the bare minimum jumping to
1440p we find the 1066 gear bar is now
more limited by its own capabilities
than the 8 gigabyte system memory
capacity when looking at the 1% lower
result that simply just 4 gigabytes
around the performance is now disastrous
at the high resolution the 3 gigabyte
1060 takes a big hit with 8 gigabytes of
RAM and things of course get even worse
with just 4 gigabytes next up we have
the battle fill 1 results and here I am
using the single-player portion of the
game as the multiplayer portion can't be
benchmarked accurately and is therefore
useless for this kind of FPS comparison
here the gtx 1066 gigabyte was able to
deliver the same performance with 8
gigabytes 16 gigabytes and 32 gigabytes
of memory we only see a small decline in
performance with 4 gigabytes which is
surprising that said though we are only
testing at 1080p using the 3 gigabyte
1060 does see a rather major decline in
performance with a gigabytes of memory
when looking at the frame time results
this is of course amplified further with
4 gigabytes though again not as severely
as I would have expected increasing the
resolution to 1440p and now we see the 4
gigabyte system memory capacity causes
all kinds of issues with this 6 gigabyte
1060 stuttering was extremely noticeable
the same was found with the 3 gigabyte
1060 and now we're also seeing drop in
performance with 8 gigabytes of memory
finally I decided to test the ultimate
memory pig call of duty World War 2
using the gtx 1066 gigabyte we see that
the 16 gigabyte and 32 gigabyte memory
capacities allow for maximum performance
dropping down to just 8 gigabytes of
memory though does hit performance quite
hard especially those 0.1% frame time
results which an hour 13% lower using
just 4 gigabytes was again a complete
disaster and the game became completely
unplayable the 1063 gigabyte on the
other hand just doesn't have enough v
around a play Call of Duty World War 2
at turn EP using the extreme quality
settings it's not the end of the world
and while some will make
big deal out of this lowering a few
select quality settings will improve
things out of sight without taking too
much away from the game's visuals anyway
I'm not trying to defend at the poor
little 3 gigabyte 1060 I'm just noting
its a graphics card that comes with
compromises in some titles moving to
1440p and now we find an extreme snow
where the six gigabyte 1060 really
struggles to maintain playable frame
rates with just eight gigabytes of
system memory upgrading a 16 gigabytes
makes a massive difference here while
increasing the system capacity further
has no impact obviously the three
gigabyte 1060 is still a complete
write-off with the extra quality
settings in play okay well I think
that's pretty conclusive I'd say for
casual gamers the bare minimum is still
8 gigabytes but there is plenty of
evidence to suggest the upgrade to 16
gigabytes will ensure smoother gameplay
for serious game is rocking mid-range to
high-end hardware we're almost at the
point where I'd say 16 gigabytes is the
minimal acceptable amount of system
memory of course as I alluded to earlier
if you've invested over $1000 u.s. in
your GPU + SSD combo then chances are
spending just shy of $200 to secure a
decent 16 gigabyte ddr4 memory kit
probably isn't something you're going to
think twice about for gtx 1060 or rx 580
owners who've spent around $250 u.s. on
their graphics card dumping another $200
on ddr4 memory is something they're
probably umming and ahhing about if
you're playing games such as battlefield
1 or in particular Call of Duty World
War 2 and you care about being
competitive then 16 gigabytes really is
a must
alternatively if you have a relatively
high end GPU such as a gtx 1070 or
perhaps vega 56 but play older less
memory intensive games then 8 gigabytes
will no doubt be fine but again for
these newer titles you are Deeley want
16 gigabytes I have to say I found it
somewhat ironic that for those that
bought a three gigabyte 1060 and this
I'll admit is a card that I had been
recommending to budget shoppers in order
to get the most from it in today's games
you will actually require 16 gigabytes
of system memory so by saving $50 on the
GP you actually need to spend $90 us
more on system memory
so that kind of changes my perspective
on things a little bit there I'm
probably being a bit unrealistic as GTX
1063 gigabyte owners will probably play
at 1080p with lower quality settings and
that will likely play a bit nicer with a
gigabytes of RAM anyway I've said many
words in this video and as a result it's
no doubt been very long so apologies for
that but I hope it was worth it in a
nutshell for today's latest and greatest
games four gigabytes is out of the
question
eight gigabytes is now in my opinion the
bare minimum 16 gigabytes is the sweet
spot and 32 your bytes is still overkill
