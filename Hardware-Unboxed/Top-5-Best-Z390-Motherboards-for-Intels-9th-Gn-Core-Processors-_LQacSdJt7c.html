are checking out my favorite jet 390
motherboards it's another top 5 video
and the categories for this one include
best entry-level our best value
all-rounder best of the best so I've
sort of no compromised type solution
there are best micro ATX and then the
best mini ITX there's loads of other
boards to choose from and if you've
watched any of my previous videos in
this series covering the Zed 370 be 450
or x3 9zi motherboards then you're
probably going to be a bit surprised by
how this one turned out okay so who
makes the best entry levels at 390
motherboard
well that one would be gigabyte since
there's n 390 UD is the only sub $150 us
is entering on your motherboard that can
run with the 99er okay fully Unleashed
without suffering any vrm throttling for
best results you really need to spend at
least a hundred and seventy dollars us
though and that will be my next pick
still if you only have $120 you asked to
spend but you really want to get a Zed 3
9 your motherboard which is fair enough
then gigabytes UD model it's really the
best way to go as I said it has the best
sub 170 dollar US erm cooling is
adequate and on top of that it matches
all the other entry-level boards in
terms of features board layouts
excellent and you get all the essentials
so it's about the best you could hope
for at this price point I'd avoid budget
models from asrock typically asrock is
very good at the entry level they offer
plenty of value but I don't feel that's
the case with their Zed 390 range and
the same is true for a soos so the next
best thing here is the MSI 390 a pro not
a bad board that one it's a decent
alternative again if you can't get your
hands on gigabytes UD model though in
that case I'd actually suggest spending
a little bit more in getting these EDD
390 gaming X that's another gigabyte
board there having said that at that
point your miles will spend a little bit
more and get my next peak so let's get
to see what that is
the best value all-rounder is probably
the best board from this entire series
in the sense that it makes the most
sense you don't really want to spend
more than $200 u.s. or much more than
$200 u.s. on a mainstream motherboard it
doesn't make a lot of sense to do that
but some people like to and we'll get to
that in a moment but yeah for this
category the gigabyte is at 390 or s
elite or the pro model a hands-down the
best options here especially if you've
only got about $200 u.s. or up to $200
u.s. to spend on a motherboard the pro
model costs about $10 more than your
leak coming in $180 us but they're both
pretty much the same board the pro has a
few extra features such as to thermal
guards for both the m2 slots
PCIe armor on both slots and at USB
type-c on the i/o panel so if you can do
without that stuff and I suspect that
most of you can then the elite really is
the better choice it's a small saving
but if you're not going to use those
features than you might as well pocket
the $10.00 and yet get the elite either
way though you can't really go wrong
with either of these gigabyte Oris
boards they're both exceptional and I
found they deliver excellent vrm thermal
performance beating $300 plus
motherboards from a soos alternatively
as rocks said 390 extreme for is a solid
board as its MSI's said 390 tomahawk but
if you plan on going all out with a core
I know 9000 K which is what I assume you
would end up doing at some point if
you're buying a Zed 399 motherboard then
I would strongly recommend getting
either the Auris elite or the Perot
model
this category is pretty simple you've
got money to burn and you seem happy to
burn it in that case I could probably
interest you in either the gigabyte Zed
390 or it extreme or the MSI mega Zeb
390 godlike both are exceptional
products and very much the definition of
overkill and I both also cost more than
the Corey $9.99 or okay at least at the
MSRP the gigabyte Zed 390 or extreme
that comes in at five hundred and fifty
dollars u.s. but out doing that is the
MSI Meg Zed 390 godlike at six hundred
dollars u.s. they are both incredible
products incredibly ridiculous but the
press you've all the same personally
though I can't really choose between the
two I'm not sure which one I would
rather have they both jam packed with
features the VRMs are fit for a
thirty-two core three gripper CPU and
there's more PCI expansion M 2 slots
than the 16-lane 1900 okay I will know
what to do with having checked out the
godlike I felt that would be hands down
the best ed 390 motherboard that'd be
the one I'd go with but the Auris
extreme packs ten gigabit networking the
i/o panel is better stocked with USB
ports and the backplate is a really nice
feature that helps to improve cooling
that is the big huge backplate on the
actual backside of the PCB and I don't
mean some sort of fancy your i/o shield
so yeah really impressive cooling the
RGB lighting looks great if you're into
that so yeah really impressive looking
board but for me it's still just too
close to call so you'll have to check
both those boards out and see which one
are better suits your needs
there are four options here and half of
them cut that great the asustor phys ed
390 m pro at gaming is a pathetic
offering at $180 us and with its low
budget for phase vr m the asrock said
390 m pro 4 is really no better but at
least it's only hundred $35 that more
accurately reflects I suppose what
you're getting there opposed to $180
then we have the MSI mpg:0mpg biters ed
390 m gaming a more appropriate name I
suppose in terms of value I'd grab the
gigabyte board and not just because I
don't want to say the name of the MSI
board again but if you have to the best
micro ATX board then yeah the MSI
mpg:0mpg speed:0mph revs:860rpm ICO ATX
build the gigabyte model on the other
hand it has a few red highlights so it
is a bit less neutral but still overall
a decent looking board
last but certainly not least is the
smallest category though it's not the
smallest in terms of numbers we had four
micro ATX boards whereas we have half a
dozen mini ITX boards so more of the
little suckers to choose from there's
actually two models from asrock and we
even get a board from Super Micro but
this time we will be going with the
asrock Z 390 phantom gaming ITX
/a see this little board packs a five
phase vrm which I suppose in itself
isn't that impressive though it does
employ is l99 27 power stages and it's
the only edge screen on your motherboard
that we know of to use these 60 amp
beasts $190 us this is a seriously high
quality mini ITX motherboard packing an
eighth layer PCB an impressive amount of
cooling for a board of its size a
creative Sound Blaster cinema 5 Intel
Thunderbolt 3 jul 2 2014 2 T 2 our dual
band 802 211 AC Wi-Fi with Bluetooth 5.0
and much more it's hands down the best
Mini ITX motherboard and nothing else
really comes close in my opinion that
said the gigabyte z3 1900 s pro Wi-Fi
MSI mpg is entering on a gaming edge AC
our bad alternatives either they just my
go-to choices for the ultimate Zed 390
Mini ITX motherboard so there you have
it my top 5 picks we already have quite
a few zat 390 motherboards and offer but
there's really only a few good options
in each category and unfortunately the
choices are narrowed down quite
substantially by what is probably the
worst motherboard range ever from a soos
bit harsh
well maybe depends on how you look at it
but yeah overpriced boards with budget
variance
seems to be the name of the game here
from a sue so not to impress what they
have on offer and I hope this doesn't
become a trend as rock at MSI have a few
good hits mixed in with some
not-so-great options while gigabyte is
pretty solid from top to bottom anyway I
hope these picks have helped you out and
if you're buying a new Z 390 motherboard
let me know which one you're choosing
and I suppose if you disagree with any
of my
pics as always very interested to read
your thoughts in the comment section
