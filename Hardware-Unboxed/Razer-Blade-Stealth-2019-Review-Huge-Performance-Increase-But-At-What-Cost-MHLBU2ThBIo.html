from our look at whiskey lake
performance a couple of days ago it's
now time to properly check out the
laptop we used for those benchmarks the
new Razer Blade stealth I guess at this
point maybe there's an a super new
device and that came out towards the end
of 2018 but it's still an impressive
piece of hardware that I think is worth
looking at in detail so here's the
basics the new Razer Blade stealth uses
a new design with new hardware all
models come with an Intel Core i7 85
65-year processor and a 13.3 inch 1080p
display the base model does not include
discrete graphics it packs a 256 gig
SATA SSD and eight gigabytes of RAM the
graphics model the version I received
review has nvidia geforce MX 150
discreet graphics a 256 gig PCIe SSD and
16 gig of ram both come with 53 watt
hour batteries in some regions there's
an even higher spec model as well with
the 4k display and a 512 gig SSD as for
pricing we're looking at 1400 us for the
base model 1600 bucks if you want the MX
150 and $1,900 if you also want the 4k
touch display supose tends to be the
case with Razer laptops it's pretty
expensive the previous blade stealth
from late 2017 or early 2018 looked
pretty decent and improved upon the
chunky older designs in many ways but
it's this new design for late 2018 that
really steps things up another knotch
it uses a similar bill to the 15-inch
razor blade in that it's a square a
design with slimmer bezels around the
display it's now at the point where the
display is really dominating the lid
area like a lot of modern ultra
portables we're not at crazy screen to
body ratios just yet
but the new blade stealth doesn't feel
like there's wasted space around the
screen the build quality has always been
the killer aspect to Reyes's notebooks
and that's still the case here the main
chassis is a solid aluminium unibody
with a black anodized finish it's simple
it feels really sturdy and it looks
fantastic it's a bit of a fingerprint
magnet but that's the case with most
black metal laptops while the overall
footprint is smaller with the new plaid
still thanks to its slimmer bezels it is
around one millimeter thicker than
previous models which
I guess next to no difference the key
area of interest is the weight which
varies between one point two eight and
one point three eight kilograms
depending on the model it's not
especially light for an ultraportable in
2019 but it's not heavy either it's you
know an average sort of weight for this
class of system looking at the ports and
features it's all standard affair for
this machine there's a Thunderbolt three
port a USB C 3.1 point and two USB 3.1
type-a ports plus a headphone jack while
there are more USB ports on this laptop
than its predecessor that's come at the
expense of the full-sized HDMI port
which is a little disappointing talk up
a monitor you'll likely need some sort
of HDMI or DisplayPort adapter now the
blade stealth also has a basic 720p
webcam above the display with Windows
hello support those speakers on either
side of the keyboard that are fairly
mediocre as is the case with basically
every laptop these days the trackpad is
expensive accurate and responsive just
like raises other trackpads
and the keyboard has a great tactile
response too it's nice and clicky for a
laptop which is what I like to see it's
also not cramped and includes full sized
arrow keys as well as a range of handy
functions mapped to the F keys it
wouldn't be a razer product without some
form of chroma RGB lighting but the new
blade stealth includes it in a pretty
limited form rather than perky RGB
lighting for the keyboard like previous
Razer laptops The Blade stealth has just
a single backlight zone that encompasses
the entire keyboard this does limit the
available effects but I don't think
perky RGB is actually all that necessary
for an operable I'm sure this new single
zone design actually saves both space
and battery the display at least for the
base and graphics models is a 13.3 inch
1080p IPS at 60 Hertz so nothing fancy
here just your typical laptop great
display the key feature here is rows are
individually factory calibrating every
display and they are boasting a hundred
percent srgb coverage as well which is
great news
for those that want color accuracy and
decent colors for content creation this
panel is one of the better ones I've
seen in laptops boasting a contrast
ratio of 1300 to one and brightness up
to 400 nits which is above average in
both regards color accuracy is pretty
good out of the box thanks to its
factory calibration the white point is
perfect at 6500 K and while that does
fall away somewhat over the grayscale
range
there's no noticeable colored tint
greyscale Delta ease of 2.04 on average
are just slightly higher than what we
class as very good while saturation
delta ii of 1.25 and a color checker
delta ii average of 1.5 5 are fantastic
results this level of accuracy is well
above average for a laptop and makes it
a great display for content creators
alright so let's talk about performance
I'm gonna focus here on the graphics
model in particular and workloads that
specifically make use of the GPU to see
how the MX 115 makes an impact because I
already covered the performance of the
cry 785 65 you in a separate video so if
you're interested in how CPU only
workloads perform or how the base model
will perform in general check out my
whiskey' like CPU review as a refresher
though the razor blade stealth uses the
quad core i7 85 65 u which is Intel's a
new high-end whiskey like CPU built on
40 nanometer plus plus normally the CPU
is configured to use a 15 watt TDP
however razor has chosen to use the C
TDP upstate of 25 Watts which allows the
chip to run at higher sustained clock
speeds the rated clock speeds for the 85
65 u r 1.8 gigahertz base with a 4.6
gigahertz single core turbo and a 4
point 1 gigahertz all core turbo but
typically the 25 watt version of the
chip hovers around 3.1 gigahertz during
sustained non-avian swallowed in cpu
heavy benchmarks the 25 watt 85 65 U is
up to 33% faster than the 15 watt 85 65
years so that's something to consider
when comparing the razorblade stuff to
other 85 65 u laptops that use the
standard 15 watt configuration you won't
see 33% gains in every app short
workloads allowed to be unaffected and
single thread performance is more like 4
to 7 percent higher but for long
encoding tasks it is a significant
difference the 25 watt 85 65 u is also
about 15 percent faster than the 25 watt
Corey 78550 Intel's previous generation
cable a refresh CPU and that margin
increases to 20 percent on average over
the 15 watt a 550 with gains up to 38
percent in some workloads that could
definitely justify an upgrade over the
85 52 depending on the system you
previously had and of course if you're
coming from anything
jool call like a core i7 7,500 year
older expect gains of 62% on average so
that's the CPU taken care of let's
explore what the MX 150 brings to the
table it's crucial to note here that
this isn't the one day 12 variant of the
MX 150 this is the fully fledged version
Razer specifies this is a 25 watt MX 150
and looking at gpu-z confirms that this
is the regular one day 10 model so
that's good news though I wish NVIDIA
would be I guess a little clearer with
their naming schemes he may be calling
that one day 12 model vmx 140 or
something would have made a bit more
sense
anyway the MX 150 comes into play in
anything that's cheap you accelerators
that includes popular applications like
Adobe Premiere here the MX 150 has a
noticeable impact on render times both
with and without lumetri color
processing effects with lumetri effects
render times are more than halved and
you can also see here that this fully
fledged MX 150 is several minutes faster
than the one day 12 version in our
encoding benchmark even without limitary
effects Orinda benchmark was 30% faster
thanks to the discrete GPU Photoshop
smart sharpen filter also benefits
significantly from GPU acceleration
again cutting processing time spun more
than half Intel's integrated GPU in
their 15 what processes is extremely
weak the MX 150 easily is more than
twice as powerful and that players out
here Compu bench is a great benchmark
for testing the compute performance of
these GPUs across a range of synthetic
tests and looking at one of these
results for optical flow again shows the
power of the MX 150 is around 2.6 times
faster than the UHD 620 integrated GPU
and it's also a decent 23 percent ahead
of the Vega 8 GPU in AMD's risin 5 2500
you that said I expect the Vega 10 GPU
in the risin 7 2700 you to provide
similar performance the MX 150 in this
test I'll be it with lower CPU
performance than the 85 65 you in 3d
mark as well we see enormous gains when
comparing in MX 150 to the regular Intel
I GPU it's difficult to see more than
double the performance especially
looking at graphics cores where in time
spy for example the MX 150 approach has
been three times as fast in terms of
gaming this doesn't exactly turn an
ultraportable into a gaming
house but it certainly makes entry-level
titles playable where there previously
weren't Intel's UHD 620 is really only
suitable for 2d games and other simple
things like that whereas the MX 150 is
pretty capable at playing fortnight for
example you can expect 1080p 60fps game
in fortnight using low settings so a few
other things to mention here the Razer
Blade stealth has two power modes
bounced and low power throughout this
review we use the bounce mode but
enabling the low power mode it limits
the CPU to a TDP of around 8 watts so
performance is significantly reduced
that could come in handy though to
extend battery life the cooler is always
a contentious issue with Razer laptops
because they tend to run hot and loud
but this is only somewhat the case with
the Razer Blade stealth CPU temperatures
were relatively ok hovering around the
75 degrees Celsius mark which isn't all
that hot for a laptop
however the cooler is audible during
heavy load my recommendation here would
be to use the manual fan speed control
to turn down the fan speed to around
3000 rpm although that depends on the
conditions when doing this I saw
temperatures rise by around 7 degrees
Celsius but this laptop was much quieter
and overall that was a better experience
in my opinion I think raises default fan
curve is far too aggressive and it could
annoy people that buy this laptop and
don't realize there is a manual fan
slider to keep things a bit quieter the
graphics model comes with a 256 gigabyte
light on ca3 PCIe nvme SSD which
performs pretty well especially in
random workloads it doesn't have the
outright fastest sequential performance
I've seen but this is still a fast drive
and should provide a noticeable
performance upgrade compared to the side
up Drive in the base model one of the
other important areas for laptops is
battery life however because we haven't
been benchmarking many other ultra
portables lately we don't have a good
selection of battery data to compare the
blade stealth with other recent laptop
release so if you want detailed Bachelor
life information I recommend reading
other reviews however from what I have
been testing I would describe the
Batchelor as above average for what it's
worth it's been pretty good but again
don't really have any comparison data to
compare the blade stuff to other laptops
so that's all the data are willing to go
through in this review time to give some
overall thoughts on the razor blade
stealth between 19
firstly I think the overall hardware
package is very impressive the design is
excellent as it always is but that's
being complimented this time around with
top and hardware for what is possible in
this sort of ultra portable chassis
design we're getting a 25 watt version
of the cry 780 565 you so it will
outperform most other laptops that
choose to use the 15 watt configuration
or a stuck on cable ache refresh on top
of that we're also getting a fully
fledged MX 150 discrete GPU so razor has
matched a powerful CPU with a powerful
GPU for this form factor for the first
time previous model is kinda left the
GPU behind with resin instead pushing
their core v to external GPU for those
that want to do some gaming this new
model I guess it isn't exactly a gaming
powerhouse but it's now suitable for
fortnight or overwatch type gaming
without any external GPU boxes the
displays also very impressive delivering
great color accuracy out of the box
making it suitable for creative
workloads you're also getting
Thunderbolt 3 plus full size USB a great
trackpad and what seems to be decent
batch life it's a really neat package
overall most of the concerns I have with
the hardware are pretty minor the fan is
too aggressive by default spinning up
louder than necessary for some workloads
full size HDMI has been removed and
you're only getting a 256 gig SSD in the
models without a 4k display though as
it's MDOT to drive it should be used
upgradeable the other concern for some
buyers will be the price 1,400 US
dollars for the base model without
discrete graphics is a lot to pay yes
you do get the 25 watt core i7 85 65 you
but there's just eight gigabytes of RAM
and a 256 gig SATA SSD here masseuse
offers the 15 watt 85 65 u plus 16 gig
of ram and a 512 gig SSD for $1200 in
the Zenbook 14 ux 433 fa so you'd have
to really want the extra CPU performance
to justify spending $200 more while also
sacrificing more RAM and more storage
and I don't think they'll be worth it
for most people
then there's the $1,600 graphics model
the one I reviewed in some ways I can
see this price being justified not a lot
of systems offer a 25 watt quad core
plus a full MX 150 GPU in this sort of
form factor
and at least you're getting 16 gigabytes
of RAM here as well when you consider
that a lot of laptops advertisers having
an i7 85 65 U and MX 150 will have the
15 watt CPU configuration and the slower
one d12 MX 150 I do think there's some
merit in spending more money for the
outright best performance yes it's
expensive but least for that price you
really are getting great hardware though
I'd still really like to see this model
come with at least a 512 gig SSD at this
price with that said again if you don't
need that extra performance you could be
perfectly satisfied with the MX 151 D 12
and even say a last gen cry 78550 you
this combination will end up 20 to 30
percent slower than the new razor blade
stealth but you can find similar form
factor laptops with that combination
that are more than 30 percent cheaper
using I guess a soos as another example
here of course it's not unusual for
top-end products with the fastest
hardware to offer less than optimal bang
for buck there's always a premium
associated with getting the fastest or
best products the question is whether
you're willing to pay that premium or
whether you'd be satisfied with the
multitude of other options on the market
and that's something that I guess I
really can't answer for you so that's it
