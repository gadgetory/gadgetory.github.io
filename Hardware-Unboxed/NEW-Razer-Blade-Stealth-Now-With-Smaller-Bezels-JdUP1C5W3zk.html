unboxed back in February I reviewed the
previous generation razor blades stuff
and loved it it featured a great design
very portable form factor and decent
internal hardware but despite succeeding
in many ways some potential buyers were
put off by the laptops enormous bezels
ultimately settling for a device that
offered more screen real estate in the
same footprint razor acknowledged this
criticism of their ultra portable and
rather than waiting for a new Intel
processors generation to debut I
refreshed variant the company has pushed
out an updated razor blade stealth well
under a year after its predecessor hit
the market you won't see massive
improvements II but there's enough small
changes to push this laptop closer to
perfection so what are these changes
well the first addresses the main issue
the bezel size the blade stealth is now
available with a 13.3 inch display
instead of 12.5 inches in the very same
chassis this means slimmer bezels and
more screen real estate 13% more to be
precise without sacrificing anything
from a design perspective the resolution
of the entry-level model is higher as
well moving from 2560 by 1440 at 234 ppi
up to 3200 by 1800 at 276 PPI the new
blade stealth also swaps out the decent
synaptics touchpad in the previous model
for a superior precision certified unit
this means the trackpad is fully
compatible with Windows 10 gestures and
supports basically the best and most
accurate tracking experience available
in modern Windows machines the trackpad
used here is seriously responsive and
undoubtedly provides an excellent
experience in all facets the glass
finish it also feels simply superb the
other notable change comes to the
configuration options available razer
has called all models with less than 16
gigabytes of RAM a core i7 CPU and a 256
gig SSD that means the $900 model with
the core i5 CPU eight gig of ram and a
128 gig SSD and that non-touch display
is
no longer available the new entry-level
model comes equipped with a core i7 7500
u 16 gigabytes of RAM and a 256 gig SSD
and will set you back one thousand three
hundred and ninety nine dollars
unfortunately this is a $150 price hike
on the equivalent model from the
previous generation and models with 512
and one terabytes of storage available
for sixteen hundred and two thousand
dollars respectively the same price as
the previous top-end four cameras from
last gen oh and there's a new gunmetal
gray more available which swaps out not
just the matte black finish but the acid
green Razer logo for a more understated
gray finish with black logo I received a
black mole to review and after seeing
the photos I think I still prefer this
variant to the gunmetal though you know
it's still nice to have a few new color
options design wise the new blade
stealth is basically identical to its
predecessor aside from the slimmer
bezels you're getting the same
outstanding machined aluminium unibody
which looks premium both slim and light
and if you loved previous Razer builds
you love the MacBook Pro style of laptop
then of course you will love the blade
stealth 2017 the keyboard is also the
same with great tactile feedback and
individually customisable RGB lighting
it's also a breeze to type on IO ports
well they're also the same with
Thunderbolt 3 USB 3.0 and a 3.5 ml
headphone jack on the left as well as a
full-sized HDMI 2.0 a port and another
USB 3.0 port on the right so let's go
back a little and talk further about the
blade stealth new display a 13.3 inch
exile LCD with a resolution of 3200 by
1800 the smaller bezels here make a
significant difference to the aesthetics
of the laptop previous models looked a
bit ridiculous with the massive black
strips around all sides but this new
model is much more reasonable sure
you're not getting Dell XPS like no
bezel frames however I still think
raises screen to bezel ratio use T is
now perfectly acceptable looking at
display performance on the new plates
Dahl's was tricky as razors seem to have
implemented a dynamic contrast and
brightness feature that cannot be
disabled unless you contact customer
support for this reason I won't give
exact numbers for how the display
forms because performance vary
significantly depending on the amount of
dark colors on the screen it also makes
the blade self largely unsuitable for
color accurate work anyway however I
will say brightness is very good rich is
a peak of over 400 nits windows blank or
white contrast as best determined in
static conditions is ran the same as the
previous blades stills contrast of 1,100
to one color temperature is also pretty
good falling around 6700 K on average
the gamut is significantly impacted by
the dynamic contrast and grayscale delts
where 2000 performance changes
dynamically as well as for colors the
eggs or panel glossy finish low gap
between the glass and display leads to
fantastic viewing angles and colors that
really pop for casual use the dynamic
contrast feature doesn't detract from
how good the display looks in general
color results have heretofore on the
average Delta 2000 range of 3.0 to 5.0
now that wouldn't be suitable for car
accurate work even if the dynamic
contrast feature was disabled and it's
also worth mentioning this play covers
97.6% of the srgb spectrum compared to
previous generation blades Stealth's
with their 1440p display the new blade
stealth car performances you know
roughly the same so there's no
degradation from the increased display
size or resolution in fact the
brightness is better from this new
display which helps when using the
laptop outdoors as I mentioned earlier
Razer has simplified their configuration
options with the new blade stealth so
it's easy to get a read on the
performance provided by this laptop as
it stands right now there is only one
main hardware configuration available an
Intel Core i7 7500 u processor with 16
gig of ram and a qhd+ touchscreen
display storages are the one hardware
component that can be modified there's
256 and 512 gig options as well as a one
terabyte option all available the core
i7 7500 you isn't a new CPU in fact it's
the same cable a dual core fan in the
previous Razer Blade stealth I reviewed
earlier this year so we're still seeing
two cores four threads clocked at 2.7
gigahertz with the boost frequency up to
3.5 gigahertz the blade stealth has
integrated graphics only in this case
Intel's HD 620 some people seem to get
surprised when I mentioned that a razor
product doesn't include dedicated
graphics
considering you know razor's roots
PC gaming but the blade stealth isn't
designed for gaming it's an
ultraportable just like other slim
13-inch machines I'm not going to spend
a lot of time discussing the performance
of the new blade stealth because it's
well basically identical to its
predecessor this is surprising you know
both the CPU and RAM is the same as in
its previous model in some tests - the
old blade stealth is faster in other
tests the new one is faster but on
average everything is about equal I
actually like the fact Razer has removed
the core i5 model with a gig of ram and
a 128 gig SSD instead opting for
variants to include better components
I think 128 gig of storage it's too
light or too tight for modern machine so
I'd always recommend people purchase you
know the more expensive model anyway one
of the more interesting areas of the
blade stealth to assess is the battery
life this model comes with the same
battery capacity as its predecessor 53.6
watt hours however we're now seeing a
large display at a higher resolution
razor still claims the blaze stealth is
good for up to nine hours of battery
life the same as the 1440p model
previously so in their eyes the new
screen has had well no effect on
bachelor in practice though Bachelet has
been reduced slightly from the previous
model I don't think battery life is
particularly fantastic however at the
same time in general usage I didn't
think it was terrible you still get a
fairly decent length of time out of the
battery in this model the previous blade
stealth was a fantastic ultra portable
but this new version addresses some
minor flaws to make it a near-perfect
option for those wanting a capable
13-inch productivity machine sometimes
you only need to make a few tweaks to a
winning formula and Rosa has really
demonstrated that here I do think it's a
little strange though that razor didn't
wait and two Intel's eighth generation
Core processors were available before
launching a refreshed blade stealth
while this laptop includes top-end
Hardware right now it might be
superseded by new CPUs in just a few
months perhaps razor will unveil yet
another blade stealth when Intel's new
CPUs hit the market though you know it's
too early to say at the moment but in
general when all the factors combined
the razor blade stealth
ends up as a superb option and there's
no doubt that razer knows this because
the company has increased the price of
the now base model by 150 dollars now
sitting at 1399 u.s. dollars which makes
the laptop pretty expensive even
considering its decent array of hardware
this is another one of those cases where
if you want the best on the market
you'll have to pay a premium whether or
not you can you know stomach the price
is up to you but you know as far as I'm
concerned the Razer Blade stealth is the
best ultra portable currently available
anyway that's it for this review of the
Razer Blade stuff for mid-2017 I really
hope Razer it doesn't ask for this
laptop back too soon because I'm loving
using it at the moment if you're
interested in buying one we'll have
links to that in the description below
and I'll catch you in our next laptop
