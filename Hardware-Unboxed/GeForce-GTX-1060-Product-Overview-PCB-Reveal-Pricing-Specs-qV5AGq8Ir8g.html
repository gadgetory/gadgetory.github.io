dollars on a graphics card find four
hundred and fifty dollars a bit too
steep as well perhaps I can interest you
in a $300 graphics card then yes today
in video is announcing their new geforce
gtx 1060 graphics card and with it
they're targeting gtx 980 like
performance the great news here is that
while the founders edition might cost
$300 the board partner cards will be
selling for as little as 250 just ten
dollars more than the 8 gigabyte r x 480
unfortunately while I have a gtx 1060 on
hand i can't reveal the benchmark
results into a july 19th when the card
goes on sale today nvidia is simply
announcing that the gtx 1060 is coming
they've allowed me to share the specs
price and give you a look at the card
itself codename GP 106 this new GPU
features 1280 CUDA cores which is
thirty-three percent fewer than the 1070
the good news here is those cuda cores
are still clocked really high out of the
box they'll operate at 1.7 gigahertz
though Nvidia stairs life to 1070 and
1080 they can easily be overclocked to
operate it 2 gigahertz Nvidia also says
across the top gaming titles the GTX
1060 is on average fifteen percent
faster and over 75 percent more power
efficient than the closest competitive
product presumably they're talking about
the radiant RX for 80 here but we won't
know for sure until the 19th when
compared to the 1070 the memory bus has
been downgraded it's just 192 bit wide
now but does utilize the same 8 gigabit
per second gddr5 memory the slimmer
memory bass has reduced the memory
bandwidth by twenty-five percent to 192
gigabytes per second because the memory
interface has been downgraded the 1060
doesn't come loaded with an eight
gigabyte buffer and instead we find 6
gigabytes of gddr5 on board which in my
opinion is a more suitable memory
capacity anyway comparing the PCB
designs of the RX for 80 and 1060 we
find that both cards appear very similar
the 1060 features too less memory chip
studio at six gigabyte capacity versus
the a gigabyte capacity of the RX
480 the power delivery is also a lot
lighter using a basic three plus one
phase design of course the 1060 is
expected to consume less power and video
recording a power usage of just 120
watts the fans edition card features a
6-pin 75 watt PCI Express connector
which when combined with the 75 watts
that can be drawn from the pci express
slot should give the 1060 plenty of
headroom for overclocking I should
mention that the 6-pin connector on the
founders edition card isn't attached
directly to the PCB and instead in video
is relocated it towards the end of the
graphics card which seems to be purely
for aesthetics although the 1060 is
expected to consume less power than the
r x 480 we find that a video has
included a slightly larger a much better
quality heatsink on their founds edition
graphics card the heat sink itself isn't
just larger but it also boasts a much
bigger copper base there are more fins
as well as in videos gone for a thinner
fin design the heatsink also features a
steel cover on top to help direct the
air through it and at the back of the
case interestingly there's a second
smaller heatsink at the rear of the
graphics card which isn't attached to
anything other than the aluminium fan
shroud yes that's right even the fan
shroud has been constructed from an
alloy installed in the little
thermaltake f1 suppressor the geforce
gtx 1060 founds edition looks right at
home sadly while i do have 210 60s on
hand SLA isn't supported I was very much
looking forward to comparing the our X
480 crossfire cards to the 10 60s in sli
but unfortunately that isn't going to
happen anyway make sure you stay tuned
as I'll be throwing over 20 games at the
1060 and putting together the usual data
analysis come the 19th I wonder if the r
x 480 will still be the cost per frame
king what do you guys think let me know
