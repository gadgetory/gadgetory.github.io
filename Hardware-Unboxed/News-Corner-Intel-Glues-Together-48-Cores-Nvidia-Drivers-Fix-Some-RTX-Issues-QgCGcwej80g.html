corner feels like I'm making a lot of
these news corner episodes lately but I
guess it's been oh I'm used to cover
particularly from AMD this week where
they details n2 and Vega 20 on 7
animators this video it won't be
covering those AMD announcements I
already touched on them in a separate
video a couple of weeks ago instead this
news corner is tackling all the other
fun stories from the week so earlier
this week actually before AMD's next
horizon event intel announced at least
some aspects of their upcoming cascade
like AP platform with AP essentially
standing for advanced performance this
lineup will sit alongside the already
announced cascade like SP and offer a
few interesting new features at this
point in the launch cycle Intel isn't
giving a lot of details on cascade Lake
ap the CPU line is still scheduled for
2019 however what we do know is Intel
will be providing 48 cores on a single
cascade Lake chip up from the 28 core
maximum of Intel's current lineup Intel
is achieving this through a multi die
approach cascade Lake ap will have what
is expected to be 228 core dies on a
single package with each die having 24
cores enabled the dies are then
connected by UPI so the chip is
essentially two CPUs glued together this
means that what Intel used to provide in
a two socket configuration can now be
integrated into the one socket
two socket systems can now be configured
with up to 96 cores which is a big leaf
Intel server platform interestingly
though they're not using email for
connecting their multi dice CPU instead
of going for UPI for whatever reason
there's no word on other features for
cascade Lake ap though presumably the
new CPU will require an entirely new
socket until did provide a few basic
performance numbers but the comparisons
they're making aren't super great so I'm
not going to bother going into them in
detail it's pretty telling that in tog
decided to deliberately announce cascade
Lake ap before AMD's announcement of
epic room because now that we know what
AMD will be providing with their 2019
server processors Intel's 48 core CPU C
rather weak in comparison AMD delivering
up to 64 calls on the one chip with a
unique IO die and triplet design with
large architectural advances and use of
TSM CS more efficient seven nanometer
process Intel still stuck on 14
nanometers have basically just slapped
two enormous dies on the one package and
called it a day while we don't know how
a.m. these epic processes or cascade
like ap will stack up in terms of
pricing it will be very interesting to
see how it pans out particularly as epic
appears to be a design better suited to
cost-effective manufacturing and yields
performance will also be quite
interesting so I'm keen to see how that
pans out of course cascade Lake ap and
epic roam our server products so they're
perhaps not as important to you guys but
usually these products give interesting
insights into where each company is
going with future high performance
desktop lines Intel also announced an
architecture event for December 11th
although there are absolutely zero
details in what Intel might be
disclosing at that event whether it's
under embargo or really want audience
it's targeting hopefully it's a bit of a
preview for what the company has coming
on 10 nanometers but really who knows at
this points it also seems like a bit of
an odd point to have an architecture
event in Intel's product cycle but maybe
they have something interesting to show
normally we don't cover driver releases
in news corner but this week's new
driver launch from Nvidia is a bit of an
interesting one because it addresses
several issues with the company's
GeForce r-tx 20 series graphics cards if
you've been following the story of
failed
RTX cards games Nexus discovered in a
video I think it was maybe yesterday
that some cards with reported failures
like crashes or blue screens were more
related to driver bugs than actual
Hardware issues specifically there
appeared to be an issue with our TX
cards hooked up to some specific g-sync
displays in some conditions and other
issues with multi-monitor setups if you
haven't seen tech jesuses first couple
of videos on it go over and give them a
watch anyway Americans Steve mentioned
there would be a driver update coming
soon to address some of these issues and
well it's here today in the form of
version 4 16.8 e1 of course the driver
also provides game ready optimizations
for battlefield 5 but the big
improvements come in these fixes for RTX
cards the key changes are listed in
changelog the driver fixes a blue screen
crash that may occur when exiting games
when using a g-sync monitor with a non
g-sync monitor it also fixed very high
idle power draw for multi-monitor setups
stuttering when playing back HEV see
videos has been addressed and there's a
collection of game fixes and
optimizations including for shadow of
the Tomb Raider which was one of the
problematic titles on our TX cards seems
like a very important driver update for
RTX owners so get on it if you do happen
to own one of those cards oh and AMD
also has new drivers for battlefield 5
in case anyone was wondering the update
provides up to 9 percent faster
performance in the title compared to
version 18 10.2 probably worth getting
though if you are playing battlefield 5
and just on battlefield 5 isn't it a
little bit ridiculous how this launch is
playing out those with an Origin
premiere subscription can play the game
now but those who pre-ordered the game's
deluxe version with early access have to
wait until November 15th to play and
then finally we get the full launch on
November 20th it seems a bit ridiculous
for a competitive multiplayer title that
some people could play well I guess pay
to play the game a week and a half early
I don't mind the whole deluxe version
gets to play early thing for some games
it's a decent way to add I guess a bit
of value to the deluxe versions but a
week and a half early for a subscription
service seems a bit much AAA moving on
we're starting to see the first impact
of the United States government's
tariffs on goods manufactured in China
see Sonic is set to raise the price of
their power supplies in the United
States to reflect the increased cost of
importing the Chinese made products into
the country a set of new prices will go
into effect on December 1st with prices
increasing by $5 to $20 depending on the
product for most products this means
around a 10 percent markup which is in
line with the current tariff rates these
prices are poor the MSRP so it might
take a little while for the pricing to
filter through to the retailers
depending on their current stock levels
and their actual cost of purchasing the
goods but those who buy a subsonic power
supply before December 1st should only
encounter their current price rather
than the increased new pricing it will
be interesting to see whether this
impacts other brands that see sonic
manufactures for like Corsair and NZ
although not all power supplies from
these brands are from C Sonic you'd
expect that if those PS use are made in
China at the same see Sonic facilities
that they too will see price increases
in the coming weeks
according to DRAM exchange DRAM pricing
is already dropping and that's set to
continue into 2019 pricing for for
gigabyte DRAM modules has dropped by
10.1% quarter-on-quarter from an average
of $34 52:31 dollars u.s. while a
gigabyte modules have decreased from 68
dollars to 61 dollars on average which
is a ten point three percent drop and
that's great news for one of the
components that has been consistently at
a high price for the last few years
while GPU prices have come down since
early 2018 DRAM prices have been
horrendous for a while now but as DRAM
exchange says we're just starting to see
an oversupply of DRAM in the market
despite manufacturers trying to
artificially limit supply so they are
forecasting a continual decline in
pricing throughout 2019 potentially up
to a 20% drop year-on-year
hopefully this report is actually
accurate because sometimes we hear about
price drops only for it not to eventuate
there's still plenty of time for the big
three manufacturers to correct courts
and restrict supply once again but maybe
those investigations into RAM pricing
actually did something from once a
couple of quicker topics to round this
one out Corsair are now selling a
pre-built PC known as the Vengeance 51
80 it's actually a bit surprising it's
taken core save this long to launch a
full PC considering they sell almost
every component needed to build a system
so basically you're getting 16 gigabytes
of Vengeance memory a 480 gigabyte force
MP 300 SSD a crystal to a DX RGB case a
CX 750 power supply and h100
I Pro liquid cooler all from Corsair and
you also get a k55 RGB keyboard and a
harpoon RGB mouse in the box also from
Corsair for the components Corsair
doesn't manufacture the system has a B
360 motherboard and GeForce r-tx 2080
graphics card from MSI an Intel Core i7
8700 CPU and a 2 terabyte hard drive all
up the system costs 24 hundred US
dollars which is about 300 dollars more
than building an equivalent PC yourself
that's not too bad of a markup for a
prebuilt these days
final topic for the week mark
has been having a bit of a rough time
lately with their software the windows
10 1809 update is still delayed thanks
to continued issues with bugs and just
today the company was having issues with
their activation server apparently a
whole bunch of people were reporting
that their copies of Windows 10 Pro
became deactivated with Windows
prompting users to install Windows 10
home instead these shoes appeared to
come from those who upgraded to Windows
10 through Microsoft's free upgrade path
in 2015
the good news is the problem appears to
be resolved now if your copy of Windows
was deactivated all you need to do is
run the activation troubleshooter and
that can be found in the update and
security part of the Windows settings
menu and after running that utility it
should correct itself of course you'll
still need to have a genuine copy of
Windows this won't magically activate
pirated copies that's it for this week's
