my PC please a collaboration of between
harbor and box and tech spot.com to
bring you our readers and viewers the
opportunity to upgrade your PC for free
if you missed the video last week
explaining what the series is all about
and how you can enter be sure to check
that out first
I'll include a link in the video
description below in short this series
will give viewers the chance to have
their PC upgraded for free each episode
will feature five pcs in need of an
upgrade I'll take a look at the owners
current set-up discuss the upgrade
options and let you guys decide which PC
deserves to be upgraded whoever gets the
most votes will win the upgrade package
tailored to their PC and the winner will
be announced on the following episode
then we'll take a look at five more pcs
in need of an upgrade and do it all over
again for the upgrades we have allocated
a budget of $500 us per episode for this
first season of upgrade my PC please the
idea is to help PC in through are
struggling to keep their system
up-to-date mele we can do that in an
entertaining and educational fashion for
this first episode we do have the first
five computers that are in need of
various upgrades so let's go check them
out first up we have a PC that started
life back in 2011 as a prebuilt from
retailer Harvey Norman over the years
owner Mason has executed a number of
upgrades to keep the old boy alive but
in order to get much further
he's now faced with a major platform
upgrade Mason did recently purchased a
secondhand 2,500 Kay but got a little
shaft on that purchase when he realized
how difficult it was to not only come by
a micro ATX motherboard but find one
that is available at a reasonable price
and he does need a new motherboard to
support overclocking the hope is to
achieve more consistent frame rates in
games such as battlefield one pub G and
csgo apparently stuttering is a real
issue with the older quad core and I'm
sure that lower clocked ddr3 memory just
isn't helping either Mason did recently
purchase a GTX 10 63 gigabyte graphics
card so we're pretty good on that front
this then is as suspected a platform
overhaul as a fellow Aussie Mason has
about $600 to play with so I proposed
the following for the CPU let's not mess
around and go straight in for the kill
with the rise in 516
slap that on the asrock a B 350 M Pro
for which will fit snug inside that
little Antec case we can really only
afford a gigabytes of ddr4 on this
budget but since we went with a be 350
board offering four dimm slots it will
be possible to expand the memory
capacity down the track then finally
since we have a little extra left over I
thought why not throw in a cryo rig m9a
which will keep the r5 1600 cool even at
4 gigahertz this upgrade will ensure
that choppy frame rates are a thing of
the past for Mason and he'll have no
excuse for missing those headshots in
future next up we have a black and red
themed build from Brett and he's based
over in New Zealand this was his very
first PC build and he created it only
earlier this year after collecting parts
for what he says was the better part of
a year
Brett always intended on upgrading the
CPU at a later date and had only planned
to use the pentium g 4560 as a
placeholder it's certainly struggling to
get the most to have that gtx 980ti and
title such as pub G and total war
Warhammer 2 titles Brett often plays in
fact the CPU really is they only let
down here but thankfully it is strapped
on to the very capable gigabyte z2 70
gaming 3 motherboard so we can swap the
G 45 60 for a core i5 7600 K and that
will offer a massive boost in
performance
Brett is also complained the system does
run quite loud so we thought we might as
well ditch that air cooler and go with
an all-in-one liquid cooler instead
something like the deep cooler game
storm captain 120 ax that'll fit the
bill nicely with the 7600 K installed
new all-in-one liquid cooler in place
the 7600 K should be good for a decent
overclock on the gigabyte Z 270
motherboard and that will certainly help
for smooth frame rates in pub G and
Warhammer next that we have a zero
unpowered gaming room from how Moore
who's based in the UK not sure if that's
your real name but if it is that's a
cool name
this system has taken a lot of time to
put together and many miles were
traveled hunting for use parts on eBay
and Gumtree we're told the Linfield
based xeon cpu was released back in 2009
and it's getting very long in the tooth
now so we are again looking at a full
platform overhaul here and the aim is to
achieve smooth frame rates and titles
such as battlefield 1 h1z1 and
Forza horizon 3 that being the case the
most cost-effective choice right now is
of course the risin 5 1600 which I
propose we stick on the MSI be 350
gaming plus with 8 gigabytes of ddr4
memory again increased ddr4 pricing has
limiters to an 8 gigabyte capacity but
with four dimm slots available there
will be room to expand in the future
converting our $500 us budget into
British money's I believe that's the
term wait no pounds and that gives us
390 pounds that's pretty much all eaten
up though by the hardware proposed so
unfortunately we can't squeeze an
upgraded cooler or anything else into
the package
crikey we're back in Australia this time
with Hayden and his CAD box I promise
I'll never do that again for the
remainder of this video right ok down
the business so Hayden built this rig
with his stepfather almost four years
ago now with the intention of using it
for CAD assignments as he is a student
of course like most of us he does enjoy
the odd gaming session from time to time
and he mostly plays a europa for
factorio and civilization 6 the problem
is the core i5 4670 is getting hammered
with the CAD work it takes hours to
complete short three-minute renders so
we definitely need some more CPU
firepower
ideally I'd love to suggest something
like the horizon 7 1700 but that's just
not going to fit within our budget
unfortunately and the idea of something
like a thread Ripper build would no
doubt have Hayden roughing at the mouth
but again not realistic for our budget
anyway getting back to reality once
again I'm going to recommend the Rison 5
1600 with its 6 cores and 12 threads it
will be ideal for the CAD work strap
that on the be 350 mother but with a
gigabytes of ddr4 memory and we're set
once memory prices do settle down Hayden
might want to add another 8 gigabytes
and then the system would be unstoppable
for his CAD work Hayden says he's also
keen to give overclocking a shot so I
suggest throwing in the cryo rig m9 a
last but certainly not least we have
Dakota's silver shadow built inside a
retro looking cooler master Praetorian
732 an all aluminium case dakota built
this rig late last year and deliberately
chose this case for its
all aluminium design and early
two-thousands appeal so the case is
staying the computer is used for gaming
and music production and with the FX
6300 the helm it's none too good at
either task the risin 5 1600 which we've
used a few times already is probably
going to be overkill especially for the
games that Dakota likes to play are the
most CPU demanding of which is overwatch
and that plays perfectly fun on a fork
or a thread rather than 5 1400 so we're
gonna save some money on the CPU and
invest that in a nice big SSD from
crucial since Dakota loves that
aluminium case so much I thought it
would be very cool to get the MSI be 350
tomahawk Arctic motherboard in there and
that's why I went for the white silver
board this also offers room to expand
the memory and storage further down the
track overall a very cool upgrade for
this rig we might have run a few dollars
over the budget on this one but I think
it was worth it to secure the tomahawk
Arctic motherboard all right guys
