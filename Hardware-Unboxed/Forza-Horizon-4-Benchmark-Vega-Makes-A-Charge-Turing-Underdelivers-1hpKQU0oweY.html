have a big GPU benchmark for you we'll
be looking at the new racing title Forza
horizon 4 which will be available
worldwide tomorrow on October 2nd now to
work out what kind of GPU you'll need in
order to enjoy this game and all of its
glory using ultra quality settings I
have tested 50 graphics cards I think it
was actually 51 but I sort of lost count
there because there was a couple of
cards that didn't work that I normally
test with but anyway it's a lot of
graphics cards just quickly for those of
you unaware Forza horizon 4 is an
open-world racing video game developed
by playground games and published by
Microsoft Studios the game is set in a
fictionalized representation of the
United Kingdom and as the name suggested
is the fourth Forza horizon title but
it's also the 11th installment in the
Forza series two years ago I did skip
over testing Forza horizon 3 due to the
terrible performance on PC pretty much
came out like a hot mess and because of
that it wasn't in a suitable condition
for testing the situation with Forza
horizon 4 couldn't be more different the
game is extremely well optimised
especially on modern hardware and to say
that it's visually breathtaking would be
somewhat of an understatement anyway I'm
not here to review the game but I will
say that it does seem to be of
exceptionally higher quality and the PC
version runs like a dream for testing
I'm using the built-in benchmark
normally I do avoid canned benchmarks
but the version provided here is very
good and does a great job of
representing actual gameplay it's also
highly accurate and because of its
Kander nature is highly repeatable for
testing I'm using the ultra quality
preset at 1080p 1440p and 4k then as a
bonus i've retested some of the current
and previous generation B range GPUs
along with some much older models with
the medium quality preset at 1080p later
this week Tim will be putting together a
detailed Forza horizon for optimisation
guide so that'll be worth keeping an eye
out for if you want to learn how to fine
tune your PC as usual our Corsair GPU
test rig built inside the crystal 570 X
has been used and it comprises of a core
i7 8700 K clocked at five to go
two gigabytes of ddr4 3,400 Vengeance
memory for the radeon gpus I'm using the
adrenaline dition 18.9 point 3 and for
the GeForce GPUs driver version for 11.7
T so let's take a close look at the
previous generation AMD and NVIDIA GPUs
things look pretty normal here the GTX
980 looks a little lackluster getting
beaten by pretty much all the mid-range
AMD offering such as the r9 nano and r9
390 the fury X came in just behind the
gtx 980ti well the r9 380 just beat the
gtx 960 for 60fps on average or require
a gtx 980 or better but for a minimum of
60 FPS you'll still require these fury
acts or gtx 980ti so that is a pretty
tall order at 1080p as we move to 1440p
I've now dropped the GTX 950 and r7 370
as they were simply too slow for testing
at this resolution as you can see the
gtx 960 and r9 380 are borderline
playable depending on your standards I
suppose in my opinion anything slower
than the GTX 970 really is struggling
here and short of the very fastest
previous generation GPUs you will notice
regular slowdowns of frame dips as you
might have expected 4k performance at
least with the ultra quality settings is
off the table even for the gtx 980ti and
fury x overall not great performance
from these older generations so how does
Forza horizon 4 perform on more modern
hardware well let's move on to find out
for our current generation GPU tests
we're just going to add in the new
geforce 20 series card since there are
only two models so far for 60 FPS on
average actually well over 60 FPS gamers
will require a gtx 1066 gigabyte or rx
580 both did deliver exceptional
performance at 1080p keeping frame rates
above 60 FPS at all times something
quite interesting worth noting here is
that the RX 562 year buy it was much
slower than the 4 gigabyte model
basically delivering rx 550 light
performance the 2 gigabyte gtx 1050 was
also quite a bit slower than the 3
gigabyte model I haven't been able to
properly confirm VRAM usage as overlays
like rivatuner
don't
to be working and actually having them
open will just crash the game on startup
so that's an issue that we're currently
looking into then at the bottom of the
graph we find the GT 10:30 in both the
gddr5 and ddr4 variants and both suck
more than usual in this title has to be
said something else you've no doubt
noticed is how well the AMD GPU is
performing this title Vegas 64 liquid
for example is still matching the r-tx
2080 making it noticeably fast in the
gtx 980ti vega 56 also crushed the GTX
1080 that wasn't much slower on the GTX
10 a key ti we see this across the board
as another example the RX 570 smashed
the three gigabyte GTX 1060 offering a
massive 21% more performance moving a
1440p I've again dropped the entry level
model such as the GT 1030 and rx 550 as
they simply weren't fast enough to
deliver anywhere near playable
performance at this resolution again we
see graphics cards with only two
gigabytes of vram are really struggling
here for an 60fps on average the GTX
1066 gigabyte or rx 580 will again be
required while the gtx 1070 1070 TI 1080
or vega 56 will be required in order to
keep frame rates above 60 FPS at all
times again we see the radeon GPU is
really schooling the GeForce competition
especially vega 56 given it makes sense
in terms of price versus performance
vega 64 liquid looks impressive but
truth be told given the price that
should always match the gtx 280 TI
interestingly the 2080 TI was just 12%
faster than the standard 2080 and less
than 20% faster than vega 64 liquid and
the GTX 10 80 TI so a pretty weak
showing here from the new RT X graphics
cards again in terms of price versus
performance okay so now at the 4k
resolution and I was quite stunned to
find the gtx 1070 delivering over 50 FPS
on average with a one percenter low of
46 FPS again remember this game looks
absolutely incredible and this is at the
4k resolution AMD's Vega GPUs do fall
away a little at the 4k resolution but
even so Vega 56 matching the GTX 1080
an exceptional result so yes still very
impressive for the red team Vega 64
liquid was able to push over 60 FPS at
all times and we saw the same from the
GTX 1080 TI r-tx 2080 and of course the
RT x 28 e TI as usual the RT x 28 e TI
was incredible at 4k pushing up to 100
FPS on average still that meant it was
just 20% fast in the gtx 980ti so while
100 FPS on average is certainly very
impressive it doesn't come close to
justifying the price premium now
comparing all the data shown so far at
the 1080p resolution we get this jumbled
mess but there are some interesting
comparisons to be made here for example
we see just how much more optimized this
title is for modern GPUs the GTX 1060 rx
580 for example can be seen easily
beating the gtx 980ti
a GPU that's typically less than 10%
slower than the gtx 1070 but here it was
26% slower we see a similar thing at
1440p the gtx 980ti in fury x were good
for just over 60 FPS on average while
the gtx 1066 gear by average 62 fps and
the RX 580 69 FPS typically we see in
other titles that they're both around
20% slower than the gtx 980ti finally at
4k again we say that you will require a
modern high end GPU such as vega 64 or
the gtx 980ti
of course the most ideal solution here
would be the r-tx 20 80 TI as that will
deliver by far the best results but that
over 70% more expensive it does only
deliver 20% more performance than the
GTX 280 I for example then to finish off
the benchmarking I've tested on I study
GPUs using the medium quality preset
with MSA a disabled in favor of FXAA
this wasn't a quick exercise at all mind
you are you looking at around 8 hours of
work here just to create this graph the
game has to be completely reset when
changing equality presets and almost
every time it crashes on the reset but
I'll touch more on this in a moment
depending on the GPU you're looking at
anywhere from a 20 to 40 percent
performance uplift when downgrading from
the ultra to medium quality preset the
RX 570 for examples or a 20%
in performance while the GTX 1050 saw a
30% boost and then the rx 550 a 40%
boost the medium quality preset allowed
the gtx 960 and r9 380 to average around
60fps and it also enabled playable
performance for most of the older
mid-range GPUs finally if the GTX 780
and 780 Ti for whatever reason locked up
when loading the benchmark I couldn't
play the game at all with these graphics
cards not sure if that was just an issue
with my particular cards or a driver
issue or something with the game I tried
many workarounds and all of them failed
so for now I can't test these GPUs well
I hope that helps those of you wondering
how well Forza horizon 4 will run on
your PC frankly I am super impressed
with how well optimised this title is
particularly for modern hardware the
game looks absolutely incredible so that
being the case it still runs very well
on older GPUs but for the modern stuff
the level of optimization really is
incredible I honestly never thought we'd
see a game that looks this good but is
comfortably playable at 4k using a gtx
1070 and I sure as hell never thought
we'd say over 60fps using Vega 56 in
fact for me Vega 56 really was the star
of the show
offering GT X 1080 light performance or
that was at 4k it was actually better
than a GTX 1080 at 1440p and 1080p so
yeah really amazing stuff there from the
Vega graphics card and right now you are
paying a little bit less for Vega 56
opposed to the GTX 1080 so at least in
this title it is better in terms of
price versus performance if only
performance looked like this in all
games then it really would be a much
different story for AMD's Vega range of
course AMD also dominated the lower end
battles as well with the RX 580 and 570
completely cleaning up here it's very
interesting that one of the best-looking
most optimized titles we've pretty much
ever seen shows off AMD's Radeon GPUs in
such a positive light that said while
the game does look amazing and plays
very well it's not exactly bug free at
least just yet anyway I did only run
into a few in-game crashes when testing
so that's not too bad for an initial
release the biggest issue though was
seen for me when trying to just get into
the game
for me the game crashed way too often
when starting up and tim has also
reported the exact same thing when he's
been doing his quality setting testing
that said a lot of our patreon members
who are enjoying Forza horizon 4 aren't
reporting the same level of crashing on
startup so yeah maybe it's somehow just
limited some of myself not sure let us
know what you're finding in the comment
section below
a couple of the patreon noted the
occasional crash in-game but you're not
the horrendous crashing on startup that
we've seen it is known that any hardware
changes do cause stability issues when
launching the game and often to correct
this I've had to reset the entire
computer once or twice Tim found the
same when changing quality presets as
well so maybe it's to do with changing
quality settings and hardware not a
hundred percent sure on that one this
was a huge pain for me though especially
when doing the medium quality preset
testing as I had to often reset the game
many many times and sometimes even the
ultimate solution was just to reset the
entire PC because it would just keep
crashing no matter how many times I did
it so a little bit frustrating but not
the end of the world
another small issue was that you can't
have any performance monitoring software
such as rivatuner open having that
software open will just cause the game
to completely fail each and every time
so at the moment we don't think you can
use a reboot you know overlays but if
you've managed to get some sort of
statistic overlay working again please
let us know about that down in the
comment section below that would very
much help us out and on that note I
would just like to add that we never use
MSI Afterburner
or rivatuner for the actual benchmarking
it's just to show you guys when we
record footage of how the game behaves
so it's a great tool for doing that but
typically for benchmarking we use
something like okay so some annoying
issues still to be addressed but
thankfully for the most part once you
actually get into the game it does run
like a dream so that's great to see
of course you will still have to contend
with the disgustingly poor Windows Store
if someone knows how to backup Windows
Store games please let me know because
that would be very valuable to us as far
as Tim and myself know it can't be done
but surely there has to be a way to do
it so if someone has worked it out
please let us know in the comment
section below because having to download
all these Windows Store games over again
just makes them very hard for testing
and that's pretty much why we don't test
with Windows Store games because of the
backup and
because the window store sucks I could
certainly rant about how much I hate the
window store for another 20 minutes or
more but I'll just spare you guys all
that noise and just say that the window
store in my opinion is trash absolutely
rubbish for games there's plenty of
better options available such as steam
and if it wasn't for the overwhelming
demand from our patreon members for us
to test Forza horizon 4 I would have
just skipped over this tile and avoided
the Windows Store pain altogether
and on that cheerful note I am gonna end
this one Tim we'll have an in-depth look
at Forza horizon for quality settings
all that stuff on the channel later this
week so make sure you stay tuned for
that one anyway I am your host Steve
thank you very much for watching and I
will see you again next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
