marked improvements over its acclaimed
predecessor including a redesigned
baseplate that made the mouse later as
well as more ergonomic the TT eSports
brand is back now with an RGB edition of
the advanced mouse I'm going to take you
on a tour today the mouse is a smooth
and cool feeling matte black plastic all
the way around there are no rubber grips
on the level 10 m due to its
well-designed shape though this didn't
mean it was hard to quickly lift off
when gaming the baseplate seen on the
last level 10 installment includes a
nice and wide thumb rest on the left
hand side as well as a comfortable
finger rests on the right hand side this
mouse is obviously much more suited to
right hand uses up top you'll find the
honeycomb ventilation that's also seen
on the TT eSports Ventus mouse as well
as a glowing logo underneath which looks
really cool a center strip runs from the
back of the mouse to the front within
which you'll find the adjustable allen
key screw to raise or lower the body of
the mouse for comfort as well as two
screws that hold the mouse together and
then now RGB illuminated scroll wheel
the all-around appearance of the mouse
is what you might describe is industrial
and it's a nice change for me most of
the game you might have dealt with
lately you've clearly been either trying
to look like a spaceship or a sports car
and the open design of the level 10 M
advanced is a breath of fresh air in
terms of buttons the mouse uses the
reputable omron switches which you can
definitely count on lasting is the rate
of a 50 million clicks that's a lot of
starcraft games left and right mouse
buttons are slightly elevated from the
body giving a satisfying click and i
like their positioning in size aside
from the scroll wheel there's no other
buttons up top to confuse your fingers
though if you used to assign in such
buttons to special functions you might
miss them the scroll wheel gives a nice
thud when clicked it also feels precise
between steps and rolling up and down
down by the thumb rest of the remaining
buttons on the mouse and here you'll
find the forward and back browsing
buttons as well as a five-axis switch
the back that can go up down left from
right and also be pressed in and by
default controls DPI and sensitivity on
the flyer the DPI status is also
indicated on the right mouse button with
red LED lights all of the other lights
on the level 10 m and now illuminated by
RG B's that can be controlled
individually in the TT esports software
here you can also configure up to 5
profiles make macros assign any function
you like to any button your life
switch on battle mode where the RGB is
react to you clicking the DPI levels can
also be fine tuned by 100 unit
increments and here you have access to a
whopping 1600 dots per inch in total
finally a liftoff distance polling ray
and even button response time can be 20
desired level 2 in terms of actual use I
found the level 10 m advance to be
really good it's a little different in
shape to the mice that I've been using
lately so there was a little bit of an
adjustment period especially with the
forward and back buttons on the left
hand side they're quite short really and
there's quite a distance in between them
so I found myself reaching for them a
little with my thumb aside from that I
had no issues and i found the mouse
really good for gaming and for general
use in windows and editing videos it is
a slightly larger mouse which means it
will suit those with larger hands and
those who prefer to use a palm group the
adjustable body to helps with this and i
found it most comfortable with the body
lifted to its maximum height overall the
Leviton am advanced RGB is a really cool
mouth like it happily uses my daily
driver and gaming mouse it brings a
pretty amazing level of customization
including physically adjusting the body
as well as tweaking all kinds of
performance settings in the TT esports
command center the five axis joystick
style button is a pretty cool addition
and it gives you quick control of
profiles DPI and sensitivity on the fly
and is a unique feature that i really
like all around it's a great mouse and
coming in at a fairly low 70 dollars on
amazon i can see this RGB mouse doing
really well for thermaltake what do you
guys think of the level 10 m let me know
in the comments and I'll see you guys
next time YouTube</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
