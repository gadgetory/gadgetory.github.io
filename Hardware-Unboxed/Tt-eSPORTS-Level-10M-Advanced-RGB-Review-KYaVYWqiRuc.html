marked improvements over its acclaimed
predecessor including a redesigned
baseplate that made the mouse lighter as
well as more ergonomic the TTA sports
brand is back now with an RGB edition of
the advanced mouse and I'm gonna take
you on a tour today the mouse is a
smooth and cool feeling matte black
plastic all the way around there are no
rubber grips on the level 10m due to its
well-designed shape though this didn't
mean it was hard to quickly lift off
when gaming the baseplate seen on the
last level 10 installment includes a
nice and wide thumb rest on the left
hand side as well as a comfortable
finger rests on the right hand side this
mouse is obviously much more suited to
right-hand uses up top you'll find the
honeycomb ventilation that's also seen
on the tte Sports Ventus Mouse as well
as a glowing logo underneath which looks
really cool a center strip runs from the
back of the mouse to the front within
which you'll find the adjustable allen
key screw to raise or lower the body of
the mouse for comfort as well as two
screws that hold the mouse together and
then now RGB illuminated scroll wheel
the all-around appearance of the mouse
is what you might describe is industrial
and it's a nice change for me
most of the gaming mice have dealt with
lately you've clearly been either trying
to look like a spaceship or a sports car
and the open design of the level 10m
advanced is a breath of fresh air in
terms of buttons the mouse uses the
reputable Omron switches which you can
definitely count on lasting is the rate
of 450 million clicks that's a lot of
Starcraft games left and right mouse
buttons are slightly elevated from the
body giving a satisfying click and I
like their positioning in size aside
from the scroll wheel there's no other
buttons up top to confuse your fingers
though if you used to assign in such
buttons to special functions you might
miss them the scroll wheel gives a nice
tug when clicked you can also feels
precise between steps and rolling up and
down down by the thumb rest are the
remaining buttons on the mouse and here
you'll find the forward and back
browsing buttons as well as a five axis
switch to the back that can go up down
left from right and also be pressed in
and by default controls dpi and
sensitivity on the flyer the DPI status
is also indicated on the right mouse
button with red LED lights all of the
other lights on the level 10m and now
illuminated by RGB geez that can be
controlled individually in the TTS
fourth software here you can also
configure up to five profiles make
macros assign any function you like to
any button your life and
switch on battle mode where the RGB is
react to you clicking the DPI levels can
also be fine-tuned by 100 unit
increments and here you have access to a
whopping 1600 dots per inch in total
finally lift off distance polling rate
and even button response time can be 20
desired level - in terms of actual use
I found the level 10m advanced to be
really good it's a little different in
shape to the mice that I've been using
lately so there was a little bit of an
adjustment period especially with the
forward and back buttons on the left
hand side they're quite short really and
there's quite a distance in between them
so I found myself reaching for them a
little with my thumb aside from that I
had no issues and I found the mouse
really good for gaming and for general
use in Windows and editing videos it is
a slightly larger Mouse which means it
will suit those with larger hands and
those who prefer to use a palm group the
adjustable body - helps with this and I
found that most comfortable with the
body lifted to its maximum height
overall the level 10m advanced RGB is a
really cool mouth that I could happily
use as my daily driver and gaming mouse
it brings a pretty amazing level of
customization including physically
adjusting the body as well as tweaking
all kinds of performance settings and
the TT eSports command center the five
axis joystick style button is a pretty
cool addition and it gives you quick
control of profiles dpi and sensitivity
on the fly and is a unique feature that
I really like all around it's a great
Mouse and coming in at a fairly low 70
dollars on Amazon I can see this RGB
Mouse doing really well for thermaltake
what do you guys think of the level 10m
let me know in the comments and I'll see
you guys next time YouTube</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
