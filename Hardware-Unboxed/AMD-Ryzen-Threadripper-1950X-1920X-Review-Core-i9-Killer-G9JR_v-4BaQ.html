slowly leaked out over the past couple
of months and lastly you saw it unboxed
around the world via countless media
outlets now the time has come for us to
finally discover if Amy's latest and
greatest high-end desktop CPUs are worth
the asking price or they just hot
power-hungry and overpriced to Lincoln
for suckers Before we jump into the
benchmarks here's a quick look at the
specifications one more time for this
comparison we'll be testing a thread rip
in nineteen fifty X 1920 x along with
the horizon 7 1700 and 1800 X meanwhile
we'll also have some competition from
Intel with the core i7 700 X 78 20x and
core I nine
7900 X when compared to the horizon 7
1800 X consumers are faced with a 75%
price premium for the 1920 X and yet
they do only get 50% more cause that
said though you do get quad channel
memory support and significantly more
PCI Express Lanes
with the thread Ripper CPU what I'm most
interested in is how the thread Ripper
CPUs compare with Intel skylake X parts
and that's what we're here to find out
finally a quick note on the test system
specs for testing the sky like X CPUs we
use the as rock fatality X 299
professional gaming i9 motherboard while
the thread Ripper CPUs were tested with
the asrock X 399 tyshee both platforms
were fitted with G skills tridon z ddr4
3200 CL 14 64 gigabyte quad channel
memory kit and a big thanks to g skill
for providing all that memory the ex 299
system was installed on the Praxis wet
bench and the cooler used was
Thermaltake specific RL custom liquid
cooling kit meanwhile thread ripper was
tested on a sheet of foam on my desk
using thermal takes flooring RGB 360
all-in-one liquid cooler
all right enough chitchat let's get to
it
kicking things off let's check out the
memory bandwidth performance as you
probably know the Rison 7 CPUs feature a
dual channel memory controller
whereas thread Ripper offers quad
channel memory access much like these
skylake x cpus
as a result of memory bandwidth has now
been increased by 50% over horizon 7 and
now Red River is on par with the core o
970 900 X memory performance is looking
good so let's move on and check out CPU
performance with Cinebench well as
promised by AMD the 1950 X is good for a
multi thread score of over 3,000 points
we saw 3028 points which is pretty
incredible as a 39 percent increase over
the I 970 100x both of which do of
course cost $1000 us the core I 9 CPU
was however 10 percent faster for the
single threaded test though that's not
exactly the point of these CPUs the 1920
X was also 13 percent faster than the 79
her X and 40 percent faster than the i7
78 20 X so a clear win here for AMD in
terms of price versus performance before
moving on to the more serious benchmarks
I just wanted to see how thread Ripper
stood up in PC mark 10 which looks at
typical sort of office type of workloads
so they're not very cool heavy to my
surprise a thread Ripper scored very
well in this test and did considerably
better than the core o 970 100 X Excel
is another office type benchmark but
this one does utilize many threads
especially when running the extreme
Monte Carlo simulation here the 1920 X
just edged out the 17 900 X taking an
impressive 1.86 seconds to complete the
workload that said it was 12% sold in
1950 X which took just one point 66
seconds making it the fastest desktop
CPU we've ever tested here for those of
you unaware veracrypt is an open source
utility for on-the-fly encryption and
features optimized implementations of
cryptographic hash functions and ciphers
which boosts performance on modern CPUs
it also supports paralyzed encryption
from multi-core systems as well as
hardware accelerated aes to further
improve performance in short it takes
advantage of the many course thread
Ripper has on offer and we certainly see
that here when compared to the core I 9
700 X the 1950 X was 48 percent faster
for the 50 megabyte test and 35% faster
for the one gigabyte test the 1920 X
also easily beat the 1700 X 2
living up to 25% more performance next
up we have non-encrypted compression and
decompression performance using 7-zip
whereas hyper-threading sees a similar
level of efficiency when compressing and
decompressing SMT is significantly more
efficient when doing decompression work
SMT boost performance of thread Ripper
by around 15% for the compression
workload whereas its are a massive 60%
increase for decompression disabling SMT
saw the 1950 X deliver around 50,000
MIPS for both tests however with SMT
enabled the 1950 X just beat Bakura 9
some 100 X for the compression test but
crushed it by a 53% margin for the
decompression test meanwhile the 1920 X
matched the compression performance of
the 78 20 X but was 48 percent faster
when comparing the decompression results
overall strong results here for AMD's
new thread Ripper CPUs can break is a
very popular application for encoding
video and we've used it to convert a 4k
h.264 video to 1080p using h.265 and
recorded the average frame rate the 1950
X was 6% faster than the 70 100x in this
test not a huge gain but given both CPUs
cost the same amount it's a good result
for the thread Ripper CPU that said the
1920 X does cost 3 percent more than the
78 20x and yet it was just 5% faster
here so a less impressive result for AMD
in that comparison for me personally the
Premiere Pro CC results interests me the
most as I spend a lot of time rendering
these 4k videos on my core i7 69 50x
editing machine back when I first
reviewed the core I 9 7 100x I said at
the time I had planned to probably
replace my 69 50 X with for every power
I had noted that at the time that the
current version of Premiere Pro isn't
that good at taking advantage of high
coil count CPUs as a result the 700 X
was just 4% faster than the 69 50 X so a
bit of a disappointing result therefore
the Intel CPU I should note that this
benchmark is cruder accelerated by using
a g6 1080 TI so keep that in mind that
said there aren't a huge amount of
effects in my videos for the GPU to
accelerate give it a higher clock semi
100 X was just 4 percent fire
laughter than my 6950 ex and both are
technical parts I was hopeful thread
Ripper could save me a bit more time
well needless to say I was pleasantly
surprised when the 1950 ex took just a
hundred and twenty eight seconds to
render the one minute and thirty second
sample video as a twelve percent
improvement over the 7900 ex meanwhile
the 1920 X was also just seven percent
sold in the 700 X so it looks like my
next build will indeed be a 1950 x3
wooper CPU moving on to the rendering
tests we have blender and first we're
running the rising graphic 27 tests here
the 1950 X offered a massive 29%
performance improvement over the seven
100x in fact the 1920 X was able to best
the core on an CPU as well albeit by a
slim margin in any case a very strong
result here for AMD so let's move on to
check out what be more extreme blender
workload has for us the gooseberry
workload takes some serious firepower to
complete and around half an hour and we
see this is the 1950 X turns in a time
of almost 32 minutes but that's a decent
improvement on the 36 minutes it took
the core o 9 700 X it's actually around
a 13 percent improvement in fact this
time the core I known CPU does just beat
the 1920 X though the margin was
extremely slim Corona comes with a
standalone benchmark it renders the fix
seen six times and we take the time it
takes to complete the entire task this
application loves threads the more the
merrier and the quicker you'll be done
and you can move on to something else
here we see yet again that the 1920 X is
able to best the core I 9 700 X even if
it is only by a slim margin meanwhile
the 1950 X races ahead smashing the 700
X by a convincing 31% margin pulverize
another ray tracer it's been around for
many years and we're using the official
benchmark for testing this application
here the 1920 X beat to the i9 700 X by
a rather convincing 10% margin and that
same B's best result yet meanwhile the
1950 X was a whopping 37 percent faster
than the core I 9 CPU and a fellow's
wondering almost 90 percent faster than
the 1800 X
this concludes the productivity
benchmarks time for a few quick games
now before we get into the gaming
benchmarks be aware that there are two
different memory access modes for thread
Ripper and they do impact gaming
performance quite a bit by default the
CPU is configured to use the distributed
mode which uses uma or uniform memory
access this method works best for the
productivity workloads just seen and
since this is the default configuration
I decided to test games using this
method first but I will also compare uma
and numa performance as well so first up
we have battlefield one and performance
doesn't look great if I'm honest that
said it doesn't really look bad either
the thread Ripper CPUs deliver similar
performance that of the r7 1700 that
does however make them quite a bit
slower than the sky like X CPUs
particularly the 7820 X and 17900 X also
please note though for these games I
have reduced the quality settings
slightly to try and eliminate the GPU
bottleneck moving a total war Warhammer
we see some pretty ordinary performance
particularly in relation to risin 7 it's
possible the game will be updated to
better support thread Ripper
that said though we are pushing over 100
FPS at all times
so while comparatively slow when
compared to the 1800 X and 700 X thread
rippers not exactly slow though the 1950
X performed very well when testing with
ashes of the singularity escalation
basically matching the korra 970 100x
meanwhile the 1920 x wasn't that far
behind the 78 20x and both red river
cpus were much faster than the rise of 7
models moving on previously we found
that risin 7 has proven to be very fast
in Civilization 6 and while not as fast
thread report also performs very well in
this title beating the Intel CPUs the
last game we have time for is f1 2016
and here thread ripper slips behind the
horizon 7 CPUs and well behind the sky
like X CPUs
again please note I have reduced the
quality settings in game down to high
again to try and remove the GPU
bottleneck even how we are using a gtx
980ti at 1080p
even so with the quality preset reduced
to high we are seeing some pretty
massive frame rates for the Intel
processors ok so as I just mentioned
before getting into the game
benchmarks that we just looked at there
are two different types of memory access
modes for every bar the distribute mode
which is enabled by default users
uniform memory access and again so far
all the gaming testing you've seen has
used this mode however you can switch to
local mode or non-uniform memory access
and this allows each of the Zeppelin
dice to prioritize which caused access
certain parts of the system memory
basically prioritizing the nearest cause
and this improves overall latency for
gaming applications that tend to place a
premium on fast memory access so let's
see how this impact gaming performance
as well as a few productivity workloads
switching to Numa has improved the
battlefield 1 performance and now thread
Ripper is delivering similar framerate
to the horizon 7 1800 X in fact the 1950
X creeps they had ever so slightly and
now isn't that much slower than the core
i7 78 20x and Cora 970 900 X f1 2016
also sees decent gains when switching to
Numa though this time it isn't able to
match the rise in 7 1800 X and that
means it's also well down on the Intel
CPUs performance and civilization 6 was
already very good and here we see when
switching onuma no extra performance was
had looking at the application
performance we see a slight performance
decline with povery nothing serious but
the urban method works better here
blender also saw a slight decline in
performance 1950 X was about 4% slower
using Numa lastly we have the corona
test and here Numa and Huma enabled the
same performance so not much else really
needs to be said let's move on to some
power consumption figures power
consumption is one area where AMD
continues to surprise me and I have to
say Intel's actually being quite
surprising here as well recently though
for a totally different reason whereas
the 10 core 71 RX push total system
consumption to an incredible 281 watts
in the corona benchmark the 16 core 1950
X reaches 257 watts a 9% decrease in
total system consumption that's a truly
impressive result for AMD given the 1950
X was faster and every single one of our
productivity workloads some basic
knitting
and yet it consumes less power meanwhile
the 1920 X was extremely fuel-efficient
consuming 26 percent less power from the
1950 X and just 18 percent more than the
1800 X it also somehow consumed 15% less
power than Intel six-course 70 100x all
right let's move on to see how things
heat up though once we start
overclocking using the thermal tape
flowering RGB 360 tt premium edition all
in one liquid cooler damn that's a
serious mouthful we found some pretty
good temperatures with thread Ripper
using the factory installed Tim the flow
was fitted to the 1950 ex with the CPU
overclock to 4 gigahertz for all 16
cores under full load the system peaked
at 88 degrees and I actually thought
that was pretty good given what we've
recently seen from the core I 979 rx
which pretty much cooked our all-in-one
cooler from Corsair however after
removing the cooler and wiping away the
Tim we covered the entire copper base in
paste and try it again
to my surprise temperatures were reduced
quite drastically now peaking at 83 and
a half degrees but often sitting at just
81 degrees with the custom pace still
applied I reverted back to the stock
out-of-the-box clock speeds and now the
1950 X was hitting just 71 degrees for
those wondering temperatures seem to be
much the same with the 1920 X under the
same conditions as expected the thread
Ripper CPUs were able to hit 4 gigahertz
but unfortunately like horizon 7 weren't
able to go beyond that point at least
not on all cause it's possible with
extreme voltages you might hit 4.1 maybe
even 4.2 gigahertz like what we've seen
with summarize and CPUs but for 24/7
usage 4 gigahertz looks to be the limit
anyway at 4 gigahertz the 1950 X spat at
an incredible score of three thousand
four hundred and eight points in
Cinebench though due to the way XFR
works this overclock actually slightly
reduced the single thread performance
because we're not hearing those 4.1 4.2
x FR frequencies on a single core you
could probably find chewing the
overclock to avoid this but with time
against us we didn't play around too
much with the overclocking overclock the
blender render time for the 1950 X was
cut
by an impressive 11 percent while the
1920 X was reduced by 6% this means even
when overclocked to the core Oh 979 her
ex wasn't much faster than the 1920 X
and it wasn't able to match the stock
1950 X in this application interestingly
this time when testing with Corona
the 1920 X saw a massive 17% performance
improvement when overclocked while the
1950 X was just 7% faster this meant
both overclocked thread ripper parts
were much faster than the overclocked
7900 x premier brings us back to the
kind of margins we previously saw in
blender here we find the 1950 X was 9%
faster once overclocked wildly 1920 X
was just 5% faster this meant when
testing with Premiere Pro CC the 1920 X
did trail de couro 970 900 X while the
1950 X was quite a lot faster please
note that the overclocking performance
in warhammer was tested using uniform
memory access and here the overclocks
did little to boost performance finally
we have the overclocking power
consumption figures and here thread
Ripper looks quite good I have to say
especially in relation to the core I 979
to X whereas the Intel CPU push total
system consumption of 388 watts the 1950
X hit 358 watts an 8% reduction for what
was often a 20 to 30 percent increase in
performance for the price versus
performance comparison I've taken the
current retail pricing for each CPU from
Amazon and you can find those links in
the video description first up let's
take a look at blender here we see the
thread Ripa 1950 X delivering the best
performance as it's situated the
furthest right are scatterplot
as you can see it also sits lower than
the core I 9/7 our X making it the
cheaper option to give you a better idea
of what's going on here is a linear
guide from the horizon 7 700 to the
thread Ripper 1950 X basically CPUs
position to the left of this line
represent poorer value while anything to
the right is better in terms of price
versus performance this gives us a good
idea of how things look between AMD's
cheaper state core CPU and the new
flagship part as you can see the Intel
Core i7 7800 X and 7820 X are very
competitive
while the 1920 X offers the
overall value in fact the only CPU to
deviate a notable difference from the
line is the core own own 7900 X and as
it is to the left of the line we find it
to be rather poor value next up we have
Corona and this benchmark looks to be
largely dominated by AMD throwing up our
linear line shows that aim D's done a
very good job here as all four of their
CPUs to live a very similar price versus
performance ratio meanwhile Intel's best
value offering here is the core i7 78
20x while the 7800 X and 7900 X
represent rather poor value the povery
price versus performance scatterplot
looks remarkably similar to what we saw
with Corona let's bring up that line
again to show you what I mean again we
see that all for AMD process is a quite
Titan alone meaning they'll deliver very
similar value again only the core i7
7820 X looks half decent from Intel
while the 1700 X and 7900 X represent
very poor value finally I wanted to
check out price versus performance in
Premiere Pro CC as you can see the AMD
processor again looked to be ahead and
bringing up our linear lines certainly
shows this to be the case yet again we
set the core i7 7820 X does the best of
the skylake CPUs while the overpriced
700 X again represents very poor value
well now that was a lot of data and
pretty much all pointed to one thing
total domination by aim DS new thread
Ripper CPUs the only weakness was once
again gaming but there really is no
point in buying thread Ripper for gaming
rather if you keen on gaming and you
have $1,000 CPU money to play with
Pocket the change and get a 7700 K the
core i7 77 ok is significantly cheaper
and much better suited for high-end
gaming in the future end games do use
more cause you simply upgrade them to
whatever makes sense for gaming
the reason I've recommended the horizon
5 1600 over the 7700 K in the past is
down of the simple fact that the rise in
processor is much cheaper it's also
available on a more affordable platform
and for 90% of gamers out there it will
deliver the exact same experience so in
terms of bang for your buck Rises and
wins
said though as I've also noted
previously if you want the ultimate
gaming experience with maximum frame
rates the 77 okay is the best option
having settled that it is worth noting
that when it comes to gaming thread
Ripper is more than capable and it's
likely much better than Intel Xeon Gold
6130 for example a $1,900 u.s. 16 core
32 thread server chip which operates at
a base frequency of just 2.1 gigahertz
anyway enough about gaming that quite
clearly isn't the point of these 12 core
and 16 core CPUs productivity is the
name of the game here and for serious
workloads Verizon has already proven to
be a beast thread Ripper though takes
things to a new level
we now have a $1,000 u.s. processor from
AMD but when compared to the competition
it might actually be worth that asking
price we've had $1000 desktop processors
for quite some time now but it's been a
very long time since we've seen such an
extreme desktop CPU from AMD and yet at
this price I do believe they have the
best offering in terms of price versus
performance in the case of Broadwell II
has well the ivy bridge-e and so on
Intel did hands down offer the best
options for power users for the simple
fact that they were the only choice so
for the past five plus years
Intel is kind of just won by default
back when Intel had no competition the
pricing of the early extreme edition
CPUs did bother me but how can you
complain when there's simply no
alternative then by the time has well he
came around with all kind of just
accepted the $1,000 asking price for
Intel flagship part and at the time that
wasn't 8 core 16 thread beast then
Broadwell he came around and well Intel
obviously couldn't imagine a world where
they would return the competition so
they went completely wild with pricing
we ended up with a 69 50 X at $1,700 us
now those things are very different
although skylax is still technically out
in front when comparing CPUs of the same
core count it doesn't really matter as I
said time and time again absolute
performance isn't everything and that's
not what I focus on with my reviews I'm
100% all about that price versus
performance ratio I review things as
though I'm going to buy them myself
and having recently purchased a core i7
7 100 X and Anna soos x-29 motherboard
for testing I'm still feeling the sting
let me be clear though the sky like X
architecture and the X 299 platform
actually isn't that bad yes there are a
few head-scratching aspects but overall
it does work very well
the problem for me is the price or at
least the price versus performance in
terms of pricing skylake X has certainly
improved but as I said in my previous
video comparing the 7820 X and r7 1700
we've kind of just gone from stupid
pricing to a little less stupid
meanwhile AMD's come out of nowhere and
decided they actually do want some
market share and the strategy to win it
back seriously aggressive pricing thread
Ripper while certainly a lot more
expensive than Verizon 7 kind of
continues with the lowball pricing and
this is a big problem for Intel in a way
the core count trying to become somewhat
irrelevant at this point the core o 970
100x and thread ribbon 1950 X both have
a lot of course and they both cost $1000
the difference being that the 1950 X was
often found delivering 20 to 30 percent
more performance while consuming almost
10 percent less power under full load so
in a nutshell for the same price you get
a heck of a lot more CPU more
performance lower power consumption and
improved operating temperatures so in
conclusion why would you buy a core i 9
700 x over this glued together 1950 X
Madden oh but that's Intel's problem
Intel did just announce the official
specifications for their 12 14 16 and 18
core Skylar hex parts and based on what
they announced at a guess I would say
consumers will need to spend at least
$1,400 us to acquire the i9 79 40 X to
match AMD's 1950 X and I seriously doubt
the 40% price premium will be worth it
the other big issue the X 299 platform
faces other than the extreme price is
its complete lack of ECC memory support
whereas thread Ripper support ECC memory
skylake X chips don't and that means
anyone serious about their workstation
won't even consider Intel
high-end desktop platform unless Intel's
willing to move on pricing and I'm quite
certain they're not I can't see why
anyone would invest in the x29 platform
and that's my honest opinion who would
have thought that in 2017 AMD would come
back and completely knock intel off
their high-end desktop perch certainly
wasn't me but I'm super glad we have
some competition back I can't recall the
time when it was more exciting to be a
PC and through this and on that note I'm
going to end this rather long review I'm
your host Steve I'll see you guys again
real soon because I have put together
some simulated thread rippin 1900 X
benchmarks you're not going to want to
