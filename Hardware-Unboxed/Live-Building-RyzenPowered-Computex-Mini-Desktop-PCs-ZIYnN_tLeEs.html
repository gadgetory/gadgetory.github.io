apparently we are live tim is just off
to my side here making sure the stream
is working hopefully we don't have any
of the weird audio issues tim's have in
the past when he's trying to do a live
stream on the channel this is kind of
weird because i've been doing this for a
few years now with harbor unboxed and
I've never actually been live on the
channel so we just sort of realized that
I do patreon live streams and stuff but
I've never done a main channel live
stream so this is pretty exciting we're
also standing for this one which is kind
of weird for Tim and I because we don't
normally stand for videos either
pennyweight we are standing and we are
live and we are building so we'll just
wait for a few people to join before we
get on with it and start talking about
what we're building and why and all that
sort of stuff
yeah does it seem like it's working Tim
it seems so Tim thinks seems so we need
the good thing is that we've done so
many patreon live streams now that we've
really nailed down the live streaming
set don't say that do not so you're
talking about the audio issues right
yeah but the only thing I change is
streaming to the main channel so yeah
yeah broke I would have been so mad yeah
how does it sound guys is it okay can we
proceed no no I'm ticking I think people
have had ran ticks or whatever he asked
Tim is feeling bad I'm not a hundred
percent but a lot better today than he
was yesterday yeah
it's been a bit rough I'm sort of if
you've been following us on patreon a
little bit in some of our discussion you
would have seen some of this set is kind
of disappearing because we're sort of a
moving house at the moment so to get
sick and moving house and have to make
videos and we've got this live stream
thing planned kind of not the best
timing not the best timing so there I've
kept them fed long term I've got plenty
of power aid not a sponsor to keep me
going throughout live throughout the
stream so yeah it should be good so as
you can see we have PC hardware and
we've got basically the same stuff so
Tim's build will be identical to my
build or it should be as long as we go
through it correctly and the reason
we're building these computers there
mini-itx really small for
in fact in mini ITX build and we're
doing that for Computex so last well
last year Tim and I went to Computex
that was the first time I had you as a
full-time partner employee and we both
attended Computex we used laptops and
there are okay there were decent laptops
but I think we were limited to 16gb of
RAM in them I think mine was only a quad
core and we already were bringing
monitors with us that's right so we're
kind of just limiting ourselves to the
laptop form factor even though you
brought a keyboard and mouse yeah I both
brought big displays so we thought if we
can just switch out the laptop for
something there's bound to be more
powerful with what I'm doing here that's
right if you're already taking we took I
think we took a 27-inch 1440p monitor
each I took a mechanical keyboard a
mouse and all that so we basically had
all the makings of a desktop setup
connected to a laptop and there were
1080p laptop screens which is why we
took the bigger 1440p because you can't
really edit in Premiere at 1080p it's a
night yeah it's pretty difficult so the
screens were a big success for us but we
thought it'd be amazing if we could have
like an 8 core desktop CPU because that
just makes encoding the videos way
faster so that's what we plan to do this
year we're going to make something
that'll fit into a backpack so we're
gonna take it you know with a carry-on
luggage and then for the plane just have
like an ultrabook or whatever so I
suppose we should probably go through
the components we have for the builds
and like I said it's basically a mirror
of each other so as long as one of us
doesn't screw up they both should work
pretty well we're saying I'll probably
be the one screwing up this so I'll
start with I'll probably start with the
most important well yeah the foundation
is build so it is the the century 2.0 if
you guys know much about this the
doctors amber cases will probably well
we'll have to put a link in the
description later but it's IndieGoGo
campaign I've got a few notes here
basically it's a really small case it's
cus it's a crowdfunded case so it's very
custom I don't think there's anything
quite as compact as this on the market I
think it's a bit small and like the
fractal node 202 but apparently that
case has heat issues this one doesn't
and then the Silverstone fortress is he
or is it whatever you want to say that's
another sort of comparable case but
that's a bit bigger again I believe so
this is it's a seven liter so it's like
console types like your name cons it's
like yeah it's like I've seen a few like
console killer type videos done with
that but anyway it's a very small case
it is expensive it's 260 us or 371 or Z
but they have met their campaign goal
and I believe that means May 1st they
will start shipping so if you are
interested in getting one you can head
over to their IndieGoGo page and yeah
look at doing that anyway so we have the
case and we have one each one is gray
one is black I don't know what color you
want well I'm happy for either we'll
find and find out what's what whatever
we get we get but yeah one is black one
is gray I think it only comes in one of
those two it's actually good sure the
different cars because then we know
which one yeah say we've got this which
will take out of the box and have a look
at in a moment and obviously we'll start
building in it mini-itx
obviously so we wanted to go well we
wanted an 8 core processor or something
that was going to encode at a reasonable
speed so that sort of leaves us with 90
100 K or the 2,700 X the 1900 can savour
Australia and basically doctors ever
recommends not using the 99 or okay
because it's such a hot bloody CPU so
yeah not recommended for this case we
could limit it to the 95 watt TDP which
makes it run quite a bit cooler but the
reason why we didn't go with the 99 or
okay ultimately is because it's so damn
expensive in Australia so we've gone
with the risin 7:27 rx so what was that
it was it's eight hundred and eighty
Australian dollars for a 99er a case
that was going to cost seventeen hundred
and sixty dollars for two of them we can
get the 2700 X's for four hundred and
seventy dollars each so that's nine
hundred and forty dollars so it's sixty
dollars from being here then watch the
price oh yeah we've got them there
that's how tray samples come shipped in
case you're wondering yep so in the tray
yep oh um sort of deal so we should be
able to run those hopefully at full spec
we'll see what happens there and
bridges and whatnot we won't be doing
any of the testing or setting up the
computers on this stream this will be
purely building it we probably do a
follow up video where we tell you how it
actually goes because it's going to be
quite long as it is just putting it
together so motherboard p450 motherboard
and I've gone with the MSI gaming plus
Ostia plus AC so this was my top 5 best
B for 15 minute X motherboard so it made
sense to use that it's a really good
value well priced think it's like a
hundred and ninety dollars Australian
cut quite remember but anyway it's good
value good quality Mini ITX motherboard
p450 chipset probably under droppers in
- processor in there later in the year
if you wanted to maybe maybe that'll be
for next year
stop drop I can't wait till we get out
the CPUs is I'm gonna be sweating not
dropping one of those things imagine
bending all the pins on the live stream
it's because we can't censor the thermal
paste application this time if we do it
well we only got the fixed camera on the
tripod because we can't afford a camera
man so well we're building we'll try and
hold things up or explain what we're
doing but yeah it is nice to be have a
top-down camera but we weren't able to
get that organized in time second
whenever we come back on the channel we
might get a few more cameras in Computex
2020 and yeah a lot of people are asking
how I've been feeling thanks to all the
messages about my sickness as you might
be able to tell in just my voice it's
definitely still a bit of congestion
there
yeah but feeling a bit better I was
earlier in the week so I'll try and tell
you the line by doing a lot of that yeah
you hear talking you use some coughing
throughout the video for sure maybe yeah
well that's sort of that drinking of
that stuff so fun times yep and then we
have arrow ITX that is a gtx 1660 there
video editing rigs so the graphics cards
not super important I think this all do
what we need it to do as long as it can
accelerate a few effects here and there
it's fine yep yep it's basically all we
get in time this is actually eight mil
longer than what they say will fit I
think we can squeeze it in otherwise
we'll be busting out the dremel we'll
see what we can do but hopefully this
fits because we don't I do have a back
I've got some I've got the Nano Radio
and nano so we can use those if we have
to but that's the graphics card 750 watt
SFX power supply more than enough and we
have the h75 course a all-in-one liquid
cool that we're gonna try and cram in
there
apparently the fans won't fit so we have
some low profile fans RGB fans from
silverstone so i just bought those last
minute hopefully that gets us out of
trouble we have 32 gigabytes of ddr4
33,000 memory so DDO you have 32
gigabytes of 32 32 is really the minimum
for the 4k footage when we reading on 16
on the laptops it was pretty choked up
Freddie choked up yeah thirty twos
definitely yeah it works with 16 it's
just a lot of swapping back and forth
and it takes a lot longer to encode and
you can't do anything else that you
can't even make a thumbnail because the
rest of the system doesn't operate 480
gigabyte nvme SSD so obviously we've got
a lot of corsair and msi stuff both of
those companies are sponsoring us to go
to Computex there are a primary and
secondary sponsor because we can't
afford to pay for flights and
accommodation ourselves so that's just
how it works but yeah we have some
sponsors for competition that's great
they sponsored us last year and that
allows us to go and cover products from
AMD Intel and NVIDIA so that's pretty
much I think everything that you need to
know I'm not sure how we're gonna go
about this build neither of us have
obviously built in these cases before I
have no idea what the procedure is but
because I've done you have you done any
mini ITX I've never done mini idea I
haven't done any PC building this year
okay because I've done I've got a bit of
experience with these little ring so I
know how painful they can be no idea
what this is gonna be a lot like I said
but I thought I might try and do like a
kind of speed build and then Tim would
do a sensible read the manual approach
and we'll see what we end up with so
yeah I'm just gonna wing it and we'll
see what happens I might make some dumb
mistakes but whatever it's just gonna be
a bit of fun there's no point it's both
building the same computer the same way
that's not a whole lot of fun if you
guys watching so yeah
I'll leave all the speed stuff to you go
nice and careful I want this to actually
work
Oh get there in the end
I might have to rebuild it four times
yeah we good so yeah we'll probably just
start getting into probably stop here
and there address a few comments and
things questions and yeah so we'll start
now basically we'll get all this off the
table and we'll just start with the case
what do I recommend this question from
the super chat we've got carnival BSA I
use an RX 5 64 gigabyte in the editing
rate is it worth upgrading like it
depends on sort of your editing workflow
it's really hard it's always good on the
CPU side you always just say more cores
more frequencies gonna make anything
life easier but with the GPU really
depends how often you use GPU
accelerated effects yeah and it can
depend as well between are using like
DaVinci are using premiere premiers more
CPU intensive from what I understand you
know different use a bit more GPU
intensive yep so it just depends I mean
I find for the big game editing videos
that at a 1080 Ti or the Titan exercise
using before wasn't fast enough
okay a GPU is getting GPU limited
sometimes where's the 20 ATT I and my
current rig is fine so that workflow
obviously big GPU is needed but you you
end up with Lauren arcs 5 and 80 or so I
use Vega 56 56 and I've been using Vega
56 for well since Vega 58 came out and
it's been on works really really well so
I don't have a lot of experience using a
whole lot of different GPUs it sounds
like Tim has more experience than I do
yeah Vega 56 works a treat all the 4k
60fps footage I even play back at full
res no no problems at all so and that's
a thread Ripper
2950 X from a 1950 ex that works fine
so yeah we'll move this stuff aside so
we've got some room I'm just gonna put
mine on the ground here
okay and we have our doctor's amber
century 2 case so I'm gonna see what
color I into that with I don't know if
it says on the box it probably was
I think this is the black one so I was
ready to see you guys standing is this
the first ever video where we're
standing on yeah yeah yeah well it's a
it's a few first so for me this is my
first time ever live-streaming on the
harbor unbox channel which is kind of
weird I can't believe that but that
that's what it is well it's mostly your
internet mostly waves in yeah and stable
my Internet's probably fine now but just
the opportunity doesn't come up we're
probably going to do some live streams
next month from my place for the patreon
members at least so Tim and I catch up
once every month for the QA and the
patreon livestream and we're doing the
patreon livestream later tonight for any
patreon members that are currently
watching anyway you get this cool little
bag so pretty neat bag and inside is the
case and as you can see very slim case
trying not to drop anything you know and
Tim's got the the grey version so in the
bottom of the box here we have all our
accessories and things I'll probably
describe them out yeah it's very similar
in size to my old before I got the new
Foxtel cable box for those who knit in
Australia yes it's very slim sort of a
bit bigger than a ps4 pro I'd say sort
of height wise in a bit bit longer this
way okay but very compact like to fit
this in a piece of luggage like along
with all our camera gear like the laptop
itself is I mean obviously this is
thicker than a laptop but well not much
thicker than bonds we were using well
that's what I was thinking like it's a
laptop is a bit wider as well because to
fit in this screen as well so yeah this
is gonna be great for fitting inside
fitting inside luggage I'm not sure
having to fit all that in here so
that'll be interesting yeah so that's
why there is a screw on either side if
we undo the screw it slides apart some
we'll find at the moment I haven't
watched any build videos I saw poles
finish product on his video but I didn't
actually watch the build process I think
I've got that ups
damn maybe okay there we go
well that's quite heavy so outside as
you go up on you'll work it out I'm not
helping you so what's going on so quite
obviously the motherboard goes here I
think the power supply goes there
graphics card would go here and we're
gonna try and pick the graphics card
here with the 120 millimeter radiator
there so okay that's that's going to be
interesting so yeah I'll get on with
that in a moment nothing better than
watching Harbor box at 5:00 a.m.
sleeping could be potentially better
anyway grab this guy so I have my MSI
motherboard beginning + AC looks like
Tim's caught up I'm a little bit sick so
sir
motherboard excellent I think I will
start by putting the i/o shield in
that's usually a pretty good place to
start is you first
I always put any right front with the
motherboard Ian you put it in after
motherboards in I just well
I can't forget it if I put it in first
that's got to go in so I'll Bend that
little tab up so as we said with the one
camera you can't really see what we're
doing that well so I'll try and show
each stage as best we can it's good
little board though probably not in
focus but you know we'll give it a shot
yeah I think the focal points about here
yeah I think it was okay that clicked in
pretty easily I Oh shield installed hmm
where is the yeah so don't know when it
makes sense to put the power it's cable
extension in and we got some stuffing
here
you don't use any IGP you encode
incorrect yeah that's right we're not
using a GPU well we don't have one
that's it
yeah just what to work super well this
sort of the Intel acceleration in
Premiere there's at least what we encode
with and do yeah it's not it hasn't
quite come to the compatibility that we
need yet it works for a lot of stuff but
just not quite what we do I just saw a
comment there saying have we got our
Swiss Army knife we we don't actually
have a Swiss Army knife so hopefully
we'll be ok I do somewhere have one yeah
we're just gonna use a screwdriver we
have a desk though we've got a desk so I
think we've got pretty much the most
important things I asked him if we had
cable ties Tim said he doesn't have
cable ties because he's packed up so
that's the other thing too I don't even
have any I don't own any cable sucks
embarrassing
Tim's currently moving house so a lot of
these sets already packed up we don't
have that much hardware available so
easy I packed up a lot of these stuff
and some of the hardware stuff is still
available over there but oh yeah and if
you're a patreon but there'll be a few
more behind the scenes videos when we
sort of take down this setup in the new
place so another reason to sign up I
guess yeah when we build Tim's new set
we might do that on the main channel so
if you're interested in seeing us build
a set then let us know more yeah we can
make that video happen so I now have a
power button so this has to run around
sort of this way right this power down
that channel I I think so maybe
obviously here we've got a hole at the
top here for the power connector and
then it has to go around that way or
probably something like this or this or
something like that we know we're doing
I think it matters which way around it
goes so yeah was that oh okay goes
through this way yep
no don't don't try no I'm doing okay I
reckon they would be these angular of
connectors well it looks like it's a
camera sunk screw no I'm not reading the
manual vote so we're gonna wing it is
there a menu actually I don't think
they're in the manual there it's online
probably they've got some really good
digital documentation there's also on
their IndieGoGo page there's a really
cool which is the only thing I've used a
really cool compatibility thing so you
can put in what configuration of
hardware you want to use and then if you
ops use a 120-millimeter all-in-one
liquid cooler then it will limit the
length of the graphics card to 170
millimeters but we've got a hundred and
seventy eight millimeter graphics cards
so hopefully they fit we'll find out
soon enough I'm just gonna use these
screws we'll see what happens is that
thread work I'll let you test it so the
black ones look to be working there just
don't over time because you'll crack the
plastic
good luck fitting everything in that
case it's very tired well pretty much
all mm Mini ITX builds are so I'm
expecting it to be quite challenging
comes down to like every cable makes a
massive difference
I wonder if this ground cable just goes
under the motherboard and one of the
okay there's actually a standoff a
separate standoff just below it I reckon
that's probably what's in this one just
there yeah yeah is that what you were
saying I was thinking maybe just if this
hole hooked onto this little okay speed
but probe tip I reckon it's easier to
probably screw that in first then do it
the way I've done so yeah
already made one thing harder for myself
so I'm just I'm just basically whatever
you say you made a mistake like oh yeah
I'm not gonna do that for myself yeah
I'll do where's the wireless anti-static
Benjy a good point
we need those Wireless ones obviously
the ribs strong bracelets yeah yeah
super important yeah come on Tim's
getting ahead of me already this is no
good that's in so we now have a grounded
power cable which is good and that is
connected okay so I might do a bit of a
drive fit like what you do when you're
tiling so I'll just see how things fit
okay oh you put your cape around the
wrong way that's falling it's fine there
we go so there's the motherboard that's
where that all sit I think one of the
more challenging things he might be the
probably gonna be the liquid cooler but
I'll get the power supply yeah where's
the m2 slot on that motherboard on the
backside is it yes it is so reckon
putting the m2 SSD in first or help
speed things up so I might do that I
shouldn't have told Tim that thing right
there wait till you got all them up off
that's memory that's not named up to SSD
this is an m2 SSD okay you keep up with
the comments I'm sorry
taking a look here and see this we might
have you guys nice
so we have the mp5 10 so I think we I
test out the MP 500 quite some time ago
it's 400 a gigabyte SSD so it'll be fine
as a boot drive it'll be very good as a
boot drive in fact but we'll probably
add some more storage if we can later on
anyway this will be fine for the build
where is my m2 screwed got it use use
the tornado bags it's a tie a little
screw so we're going to need to find a
tiny little screwdriver so the small
ones are the top almost stab you there
that's done me easy way to get fired
good reviews though okay that is done up
I'll leave that for you
MDOT to SSD installed on the back of my
Mini ITX motherboard so we should be
good there I'll sit that back in there
for now and I'll get back to my 750 watt
power supply okay I've been stunned by
that one more than once or at least once
anyway yeah it's very frustrating you
think you're finished then you got to
put the storage in go undo any of this
you'd probably have to take a lot out as
well it's not just the one component
yeah I've seen a few questions at the
time here um good to see there's a lot
of you us viewers out there with your
sort of after dinner late night type
times is just about to take over 1 p.m.
here so it's still 50 6 p.m.
neither of us have had lunch no but
we're we're we're going to be hungry for
some Nando's I think
encouraging me to work quickly you us
guys will be like what the hell is
Nando's never heard of this but it's
like a it's a great chicken joint found
here and also I think in the UK maybe
there's one or two joints in in the US
but Steve you love it I love it to be a
bit of a talking point among the the
patreon members in our discord chat a
lot is about about Steve's love for
Nando's will be I think I've worked out
how the power supply goes in so far just
none of that screwed in but I think
that's how it's going to look those
power cables in reasonably what are we
going to need in terms of power cables
well when you put the riser into sort of
angle thingummy - yeah I should be right
you're right no worries okay yeah is it
like KFC I think Oh KFC is definitely
more your fast food joint Nando's it's
it's still sighs I think it's a big
chain restaurant but I Nando's yeah
sorry like KFC no not at all okay power
while you're figuring out all the layout
I'm just going to go straight in try to
sing for you in because if you figure
out the way out I don't need to I might
not tell ya yeah might be easier just
it's a good thing I don't have eyes you
won't work it out okay 24-pin ATX power
connector pretty obvious we need one of
those
we need an eight pin CPU power connector
that's a PCI Express do we need any
4-pin molex for this build I don't think
so all these fans got chili networks nah
don't do four pin yep I would have
thought we might need a solder for the
pump I'm not sure making it potentially
amazingly
we're hooking up the RGB and stuff like
this sometimes that needs it as well
there's no real need to hook up the RGB
mostly because you can't see it in this
build really I mean you get a glow I
suppose
okay so let's plug that in there and so
as promised we've got our rise in 720
700 X beautiful the exact one that we
wanted and it has actually been doing do
not do not drop that no that'd be bad
there's 50 on 50th anniversary editions
of these right now as well right like
you can get one that's signed by Oasis
ooh they officially announced those I
think as well as the 50th anniversary
Radeon 7mn they're not much more
expensive than the regular ones so I
don't like you have to pay a big premium
just to get a signature yeah I mean if
if that's something you're into then
sure that's fine okay I'm just gonna
plug a soldering because if I can
squeeze a two and a half inch driving at
some point I would like to you're not
sure how usually though how easy that
will be to do anyway okay yeah you pick
up it just falls out that would be
embarrassing
yep okay continue my standard build
method and plus the memory mixed okay
and thank you for the super chat for
lunch later appreciate my beauty liking
to chickens now we'll get around to that
thank you very much the harbor box ways
kind of you just feed in lunch wherever
no set times no the works done
always after benchmarking yeah okay well
I think I'm gonna screw the power supply
in because I think that's
I want I think I think it's all set up
nicely a vengeance
don't PFC as usual well low profile
memory yes yeah okay so we've got to use
the proper threaded screws I'm just not
paying attention oh I've got tweezers
the stream is saved awesome excellent
and a sticker okay cowboy Corsair it's
kind of powered by AMD but it's partly
powered by Corsair they're taking a bit
too much credit they're good we could
have fit much more powerful graphics
cards in these builds but as we said
it's for editing so there's probably not
much point yep that said if MSI had have
had like an RT X 27 or something like
that we would have happily taken it yeah
okay for those of you who just joined
the stream now I'll have him didn't see
when we went over all the components
this is the GP that we are using here
yes MSI Aero r-tx
gtx 1660 as Steve was saying we're not
quite sure where this will fit it seems
like it might be a few millimeters too
long but we have a dremel so that's fine
we'll make it fit oh yeah we don't want
to go to the backup cards that's just
that's copying out right yeah we'll make
it work power tools may get involved
that's right ready to go in okay
no the arrow is not a blower card I
think it is it a while to fan I'm not
sure I've actually never used one so
this will be at first it looks like it's
a single fan but that's fine in this
case because there's a lot of
ventilation on that top section that
will doesn't really require the blower
should be able to yeah the hot the whole
GPU section I think it's basically
ventilated nicely okay we've got a guy
giving us some more super chat so thanks
to that thank you very much she's from
Canada yeah I'd like to go to Canada one
day yeah like I've been to the US but
not Canada just yet
there's no tech events held in Canada is
there no I don't think so I think
Canadians right get screwed on pricing
like we do here even though they're
right next to the US which is kind of
disappointing yep okay
so I think power cord goes in something
like that bit of excess to try and tuck
away so the question is should I bother
reading the important information yeah
probably
what important stuff is in here okay
electric shock hazard oh that's it we're
really strong bracelet I'll put my CPU
in do not drop it CPU is in so Dodge
double they're dropping that now why is
this not screwed in is this so I might
just put a screw in it because I keep
bending it right is yours the same yeah
obviously you meant to screw it in when
you put this stand or something else in
last I've been this side section area
yeah I'm just gonna put once
and wives I kept bending it out front
panel should I do the front panel stuff
now probably here's the front panel
stuff on this board yep it is a few USBs
here
I'm gonna guess what's what so we'll see
yeah okay yes you need to add in the
front USB separately yep this cable just
this two on this front edge just popped
out the there's two USB Coliseum you've
got this cable you need to then run
through the system around the power
supply is anyone in the comments telling
us that we're doing something in the
wrong order yet it's good good point
people just going over endgame spoilers
actually I don't I'm going to see that
movie with my wife tomorrow night no now
you're gonna get extra space I've
already seen it ban anyone that's
putting spoilers in there I am already
good so there's no point I've seen it
well I can no longer read the chaplain
oh this is your no that's my sister he's
my memory can't wait for the cable
management I can't wait for the cable
management either that is going to be
painful so anyway well this keyboard
cross that bridge when we come to it we
stop the street so I'm glad this 2014
table what for calcified definitely
comes with screws yep
mind you anyway
was it a nice big bad might have been
there I have no I just ripped it all
apart didn't pay too much attention
so I'm going to leave that there eight
ping bring that around honor they've
included with the zip ties I've got the
cables out the tweezers get it wrapped
in sorry using the wrong terminology
okay this is not reaching very easily
this eight in some I'll just connect it
and then see what I can do with it hmm
it doesn't really reach around very well
okay we'll leave that as it is for now
looking very cable managed what am i up
to now what would be the next thing to
do what's the next logical step probably
probably the all-in-one liquid cooler
depends on the screws I have a GPU in
there yeah here's the little riser PCI
Express times sixty an adapter I'll just
stick that in there for now you might
have to take that out put the card in
not sure and the front panel USB three
that'll be easy to put in later so I
rush that probably the all-in-one liquid
cool off his next move all right I think
we're doing well we're pretty much done
the easy part so far though so I won't
celebrate just yet
how's the chat going so good I think
have I missed any people just shut it
looks themselves seems like a good you
guys keep doing that well we are trying
to concentrate
I've only go to sit in there time left
before I died from illness yeah Tim is
on borrowed time okay
so this is the corset h75 all-in-one
liquid cooler I've never ever used this
model or seen this model before but
pretty similar to their bigger units but
obviously you've got a 120 millimeter
radiator it's fairly compact there's no
bulging bits that'll take up room
unnecessarily bending the hoses and
whatnot will be interesting it'll be
interesting that's for sure and that
does not seem fun I'm not sure the best
way I might put the 6 pin PCI power
connector back for now and I'll work out
whether how that goes later I don't
actually know where the 2.5 inch drives
are going this either so I might just
pass the SATA cables back and is that
either 2.5 inch no but I just put the
cable in because I probably want to add
one of them if we have room the ability
if there is any room anywhere yep
so are you gonna read the instructions
on how to how to fit this sucker in so
there's instructions on how to fit that
exact CPU cooler in this well you know a
liquid cooler so the cables have to go
and okay so they come out right in a PSU
so I probably have take the PSU app to
get that I don't know I have no idea
what we're about find out it's good and
a confirm that I have no idea
yeah screwdriver
I don't know why put these screws you
know what I was doing in my house pretty
certa now we're coming back out we pull
the tree along thank you for the super
chat Trin Gilly
much appreciated I'll go towards that
Nando's wondeful over oh you know end up
with a pretty big lunch the way away
goin we really need to get nanos to
sponsor us the amount of Troy as we talk
about stop talking about them I know the
chickens good but I've unscrewed the
power supply and it doesn't want to come
out now it is stuck okay do some cpu
cooler testing before I plug in any of
the cables I may have read I may regret
putting the power button in first as
well here I think we should get a
counter going for how many times we have
to re undo things yeah so that would
probably go in man this is going to be
tight boy oh boy is that going to be
tight so redo the power switch back up I
think we could have done our first ever
live stream build on the main channel
with life just a really standard big
tail ATX case or something no we've gone
full on hard mode okay Tim's first ever
Mini ITX build pretty much there we go
power supplies behind of back in I know
it's kind of this looks really wrong to
me but I don't see any other way for it
to fit
hopefully that's right I'm not breaking
anything
yeah try and get the power switch cable
back down there but you're right I
shouldn't screw in the power supply
you shouldn't screw in anything it feels
like there's something stuck under the
power supply it's a it's a power cable
once I sort that out okay yep all going
smoothly so let's connect the IR to the
CPU maybe take a look at how whether you
need to screw in the fan don't give me
tips Tim we're not on the same team here
ah we're building enemies
Tim family friendly show of course yep I
just have to call you stuff like a
dingus family friendly work yeah
absolutely
okay so I'm not sure the best way place
this for maximum cable squishing well
let's go with that okay so we'll have
the brackets for connecting that pin
here it's pretty cool here in Australia
at the moment on a nuts 20 low 20
degrees probably in Tim's garage I get
your phone call during a stream how
about this come on Tim you meant to get
professional
I put my phone on silent okay what is
going on in the chat right and I think
anyone's screaming at us that we're
doing it wrong yet so not that you guys
can see that well so maybe this having
this one fixed camera works to our
advantage they can't see us crops as
easily
I did see a comment saying not enough
they're more paste so for those of you
wondering Tim might show you in a minute
it has factory applied thermal compound
so which is about as good as you can get
because it's consistent and it's thin so
it's pretty good now I have pushed my
mounting plate around the wrong way like
a complete Degas can you believe that
Tim biggest dingus yeah I gotta pay more
attention to many too many too much
reading of the comments SATA where in
Australia are you guys based we are in
Victoria except we're at opposite sides
of Victoria Tim and I that's why we only
catch up once a month it's about two
hours drive from my place to Tim's or
vice versa obviously so yeah that might
work better it's not with this field
it's not about what looks the best it's
about what Matt you know maximizes space
or minimizes how much space you're
taking up one of these four cables okay
so my CPU cooler he's installed and my
cable management so far he's on point
and how we gonna get that part in I have
no idea I yeah no idea where I'm at here
they're not huge connectors on on the
you've just got to try to flatten them
as much as you can without actually
pinching them so it's a delicate game
yep so radiator there are pretty sure
you screw that in through the grille now
we bought some slim fans hit mine so
this is a Silverstone fw1 2 for a GB we
don't need that anymore actually I can
probably get rid of that I do have the I
only have one of the nock to a fan so
we'll leave that up there that was $10
more than these these we're I think 29
oz eh and that one was 39 something like
that anyway I'm not even trying to
bother with the RGB to be honest with
you
I particularly want RG a it's more
cables as well if you can't really can
we minimize Gables I might even just cut
it off right normally I would put it
this way to maximize a length okay well
that fits
I might screw that on to the radiator
only problem is I don't have screws to
screw that on to the radiator they're
all too long so hmm do you have an
assortment of screws Tim no I know you
you're gonna be bucket of your place
about ten big buckets so here is the
screw that normally goes through these
fans so just a wee bit pokes out except
the fan I'm using is only 12 mil thick I
believe it is so that is going to go
through the fins and that's not really
ideal so we could either get the Dremel
out and cut
or I could find something to use as a
spacer hey I don't know about that
anyway I'll just gently put one in for
now please stop hogging the screwdriver
to me so I'll just gently put those in
just to hold the fan in place and we'll
deal with that problem later so you at
least the fan can't fall out now I'm
just going to flip this over and mush it
down and work out how I want to mount
this radiator I wanted us close to that
back wall as I can possibly get it it's
not the angled connector looks like it
has to go in there so that's what I mean
thankfully these screws work because I
don't want to use large screws you know
they don't work the thread is true fine
so I'm going to have to use do we have
any extra screws anyway not PC suitable
screws there's no hmm okay would you
need no that's all right I think will be
our idea I should have brought extra
screws damn it I was trying to make sure
we had all the hardware we need anyway
that's fine
I'll just use these screws for now
they're definitely not ideal try not to
drag them on your table here cuz it'll
scuff them up pretty badly okay I should
probably screw the power supply back in
but I think I think I'm done with that
laughs damn it okay I'm just nipping one
screwing I think your motherboard and
use the hex head ones or the gray ones I
use those top screws they will find the
standoff sir yeah for the finer thread
okay well I'm going to plug my power
supply back in just because and this is
still looking like a pretty big mess but
I'm getting close to fitting everything
in and then we'll do a cable management
last yeah we'll do that last error I
checked graphics card now this is going
to be interesting cuz I don't know if
this is gonna fit technically it
shouldn't fit it'll be extremely close
I'm just praying it fits yeah we'll see
oddly this card is longer than the MSI
r-tx 27 t arrow by a couple of
millimeters yeah at least it was on the
MSI website on their spec page so that's
a bit of a strange choice so we could
probably shave about three mil off the
card if we were to cut the plastic there
see the plastic around you hmm
that's only heatsink though isn't it on
the back as well you could shave the
aluminum heatsink that starts to make a
big mess though you're still gonna take
the counter part when you start cutting
steel like we can butcher the plastic
well yeah but if you start cutting metal
you've really gonna take the cooler off
so well I put fits it's gonna be
extremely talking we kind of knew that
ah so this piece off
catching up Tim not really you're ahead
of me look at this yeah I'm flying look
at that mess
look at my spaghetti messy it does that
did you take yours fully off teacher
yeah it comes fully off I'm just gonna
leave my uh we only were hinged teams
I'm huge do everybody yes I went why I
kind of square well that's not in yet
that's just kind of butchered in but no
no that if you remove the plastic shroud
that will probably or might be bending
the plastic a little yes oh I think I do
have to take this off it's not minty
it's not going to do what I do that
holds in the GPU a little bit okay well
it's kind of going but yeah they'll be
some bending in there that looks like it
seemed kind of kind of flexi there's
some flex in the face baby don't think
that's advisable but anyway like my
cards um
it's got whatever the opposite to GPU
saggy yep
that doesn't look good at all but at
least I can change that fan easily yeah
the the PCBs bent quite violently they
may pretend that didn't happen hopefully
it still works
moving on it would be wise to definitely
trim the end of that that card off that
does not fit correctly at all I won't do
that when I get to that part you're
gonna get the dremel a tire or dribble
down love it love it a little bit of
modding so hopefully mine turns on and
works okay
I didn't hear any cracking so we should
be good
that's my rule as long as nothing makes
a cracking noise you're all good no idea
I'm gonna get that PCI Express power
connector in but I'll just put one screw
in each end and we'll we'll work that
out later okay so there's my super
straight not bent to buggery gtx 1660 I
wish it was a 1650 I wouldn't mind
punishing one of those anyway it is what
it is
and it is bent yeah well moving on a
plant doesn't have a back plate would
have been a lot harder to bend it so I
do do need sila power is suspected
connected um I'm just about finished so
somehow I have to get this into the top
of the graphics card yeah to the top
yeah well if it's on the back we're
really screwed
so tops the only option I'm not sure the
best way to reroute this cable though
over the back of the graphics card
wouldn't block as much air flow it won't
look pretty but it won't block air flow
something like that and then I'm gonna
take this back off cuz they're right no
it's gonna be so bent so bent only this
car can be bent so many ways that won't
know what's going on anyway sometimes
yep
these tables in place someone said that
is very small any real airflow well the
beauty of this case is it uses the
components cool themselves like the
graphics card just draws air in straight
from there
sure exhausting that air may be
difficult the AI oh it's got a pretty
pretty good set up you could open up the
backside of the case there to let the
air out a bit better but it should be
okay
should be okay okay what's not going to
be okay is what I'm about to do that's
definitely not gonna be okay hmm these
cables are a bit of a liver mess all
right no idea how this is gonna work
somehow I've got to get this in here
which will be the easy part
so that's in there now I have to bend
the cables back in limbs back on
themselves pretty much right away that's
how it appears to better get this on I
might just like this bracket do the
bending for me see how you did
you have the cables cutting at the top
have I got this around the wrong way
okay why is it not going back in for me
oh okay there we go
this is not going to be easy no
nothing's lining up anymore okay
yep I'm glad that's open that's the best
I can do there okay
well it's not pretty but it's in there
hopefully it works okay so I'm pretty
much up to sorting all these cables out
and you know I think Wes I'm forgetting
something which is quite possible well I
can't do much about the PCI Express
power cable that's just that's that I'm
just having it permanently just hanging
out I don't know what I honestly don't
know what to do about it
so really doesn't look like it nothing
at the moment so the 24 pin cable I'm
gonna try and deal with that first
tip and I can just sort of push that
down around the power supply so good
luck instruction manual time so that
presses down there fairly well not
really that well but it does
I'm just gonna rerun the 8 pin through
there
okay the eight pins causing me the most
trouble but I think I've just about got
it
mmm I can't quite get it around the top
of the memory so that's okay to be a
little cramming oh yeah mmm
I wish there was somewhere I could cram
this SATA cable in but there isn't
really so that all of a liquid cool has
kind of taken care of itself I have no
idea I'm gonna get the case back on I'm
kind of thinking that'll be a challenge
[Laughter]
we just need to put this into a fan hit
up any do at this point is just for
monitoring okay connected that up
where's the pump header on this floor I
don't know if it has one well it doesn't
actually matter cuz it's got the 17
power so this is my fan connect that up
to the CPU fan head up
connected uh-huh that cables about five
times longer than I need it to be I'm
not going to bother with the RGB I don't
think especially since I kind of am a
fan correctly drew though not having the
right screws on hand so we'll just shove
that in under all the power cables and
forget about it and we'll do that with
the same with this excess here so
how is it looking I really don't like
the six pin cable but my cable tie all
that stuff in but that's kind of where
I'm at so it's looking okay might bust
out a few tweezers here and see if I
okay it'll tie down this do we have a
monitor so we can actually see if they
power on before the stream ends lg1 over
yet okay cool I can't wait till Tim puts
his graphics card in tell me awesome
well I'm just got a CPU cooler on so I'm
unhappy with myself at this point do you
have any army pliers or pointy nose
really no cuz cutting cable ties with
that's dicey as you're gonna hack a
cable in half anyway well I'm just gonna
see if that works I think let's see if I
can get though the case that's where I'm
at
normally I'd spend a bit more time but I
just might see if it works
here it is this is what I'm looking for
I'm interested to see how that graphics
cards getting on so this is a massive
problem getting that the top of the
graphics card you know if there's a
solution for that but I don't think I'm
gonna get the case over that I don't
think there's anything we can do about
it don't know if anyway in the comments
knows what I can do about that but yeah
that's not that's my problem the cards
too tall
is there taller than normal yeah it is
yeah it is stupidly maybe enough to give
a backup card no I want it to work what
can we do here
yeah the cases are very expensive two
hundred and sixty us or three hundred
and seventy Australian so yeah expensive
hmm how am I gonna get this case back on
so yeah the graphics card
the MSI car we've got for whatever
reason MSI is made their their Mini ITX
cards taller than what standard by about
ten mil that's causing us major issues
and there's not really anything we can
do about it there's not a lot I can do
there's just no way that's going to go
on so that is the problem with these
Mini ITX builds they can be a bit
difficult there's just no way I'm going
to squeeze that on there do we just
apply a bit of violence and see where we
end up
super long long boys
yeah we could cut a hole in the case
there man that graphics card is getting
so bent it's crazy that is that's no
good definitely not gonna happen so I
either hack the case or I get a
different graphics card how frustrating
yeah that's that's pressed down as much
as you can possibly like that's solid as
a rock now you can't press these cables
down anymore it's about three mil yeah
two or three mil and nothing how easily
you guys can see that on the camera but
that is my roadblock right there so hmm
the other question is can you shave the
connector as in like the connectors
preventing the cables from bending
further so I can because the connectors
only plugged into like you know we don't
really need all this shrouding there how
much can we shave around the edges of
that connector that won't work
you'd have to modify it you have to put
the character on the back of the card or
something probably not worth the time
and effort I don't mean I'm in the plug
it goes yeah you've got it you'd have to
shave the end of the plug and the
connectors off and then the rim around
the top to make like a low profile it's
not yeah well we're just turning on the
top bit but obviously you still want to
go further into the socket as well so
you guys shorten the pin length as well
there's two hmm well I think I'm gonna
have to bite the bullet and change the
graphics card is that's it one do I have
in here these aren't the correct boxes
for so that is a gtx 1053 gigabyte so
Tim can have that and this is a nano so
the connectors in the back of that but
the cards so short and I think it'll
matter let's have a look yeah that'll be
fine that's way smaller all right well
that sucks but ultimately for an editing
rate it's not really going to make any
difference but it would have been good
to use the cards MSI supplied
so this is the fun of building mini ITX
systems if you if we had a bit more time
to gather the parts and whatever I would
have done a bit more research into the
graphics cards I have no idea these
cards were taller I sort of just had to
go with whatever MSI could get us in
time and this is all they could get
unfortunately it doesn't pick me over
trying it this bent thing back here oh
yeah
this card is so relieved to be out of
there it looks like the bend was not
permanent that does have a little bit of
a wave in it but that could just be from
the cooler so time for the do-over got
this little sucker so we'll put that in
there cables go in the rear of this card
rather than the top don't know why the
cables such a mess here but anyway and
Tim's is power cable loose so that's
good because it's only a 1050 actually I
can run the cables through here now
because that cards so much shorter so
the Nano is very mini ITX friendly I was
designed for yep getting the sniffles
mate yeah a little bit appreciating your
narration job so I don't have to do yeah
I'm doing my best to just talk crap the
whole way through this stream so so my
voice doesn't it yeah crap it on me well
we're still going to do a Q&amp;amp;A at least a
two-part Q&amp;amp;A after this then at least an
hour-long patreon livestream and Tim
will do a favour talking for the patreon
livestream so we've got a lot of work to
do today
yeah it's pretty crazy but we'll get it
done alright I've managed to somehow get
that through
yep that is through okay still an
absolute mess but it is through what's
going on in the comments I need to make
a short rx 570 yeah basically we just
needed to do a bit more research on the
graphics card you know this you know
like do you want to do a live stream
build I'm like yes then I got sick and
but I don't have to do any other work
yes yes all right well I think that's in
that fit really easily so big win there
for the radeon GPU it fits by a mile
too much free space now we haven't
sacrificed anything in the vram
department so they weren't TI's were
though they were just 1660s all right
there we go so plenty and we've got
probably 20 or probably 25 mil of
clearance at the top there now because
the cable comes out the back it kind of
goes over the fan but I reckon I can
probably bend it I've never used the
word Bend so many times in a PC build
before it's not the sort of thing you
don't usually associate that with PC
building but in this instance we
definitely do so there we go look at
that that's all right
there's my dodgy fan without the right
screws but if that was screwed in wait
how are you not able to get the screws
in because they're for 25 mil thick fans
not 12 so you'll go into the fins
you'll verge the crap out of your
radiator don't do that mmm we'd have to
take this whole live stream down if you
did that now this is definitely not a
build guide people do not do not build
how we're building take more care
okay if you have to use the word Bend
more than more than once or possibly
even once then you're probably doing it
wrong so that goes that'll way okay all
right
gonna get the liquid cooler hose away
from the top of the power supply
probably should you use the tweezer
there I think I'm at work okay the case
squishing things down is part of my
cable management strategy if you haven't
noticed in there has a gown Tim yeah I'm
so glad you didn't put those screws
through the fins they are the rad all
right where are all my screws there we
go with your screwed did you screw into
that yeah you screw into the second knot
you managed to get into that very back
row screws that's good they're all
talking amongst themselves our plan has
worked nine nano in 2019 for gaming it's
well it depends it the GPU is more it
outweighs the vrm buffer so if you tweak
the quality settings and whatnot it's
still pretty good but if you want to use
ultra and stuff and like games like shut
off the Tomb Raider
or as it's known in that game highest
quality preset you won't run into
problems
the the stack together the standard
screws work just fine oh yeah
so I'll do that up a little bit Tyler so
this case is a bit like me it's got a
slight bulge on each side no dramas we
get by well there you go mine's done
it's a heavy little sucker very heavier
which isn't surprising given what we got
in there so I'm glad I brought those
spare graphics cards because this would
have been a bit of a disaster without
the Nano
so I you didn't mean these screws you
meant yeah I use them
oh no sorry I didn't nice I used the
power I borrowed two from the power
supply yeah so don't put it down and
drag it on the desk cause it'll leave a
good mark
so there's mine no idea if it works no
idea if the power button is even in the
right spot because I guessed yes yeah it
might work it might not that's that's
part of the fun oh I forgot the USBs
you're right damn it does it well let's
see if it works first before I take it
all apart so to actually grab the
monitor yeah yeah I'll do that because
I'm pretty certain this thing's coming
back apart not just for the USBs stupid
USBs I knew I'd forget them so am I
using this tiny little Marty here
32-inch
okay is that in shot yep that's in shot
okay I need a palpable wooden some power
cables few power boards rather place do
we have a DVI or well either I'm sorry
DisplayPort or HDMI DVI oh there might
be is there an issue my living room I've
got to be super careful not to unplug
the screaming system here
that idea I pushed in that would've been
embarrassing we're still up and running
yep
no usb3 hitters not don't need front
panel USB three I did that deliberately
because there's there's four on the back
of the board that's all I need it's fine
Tim just ran away left me by myself um
yeah so hopefully this works hopefully
but yeah the graphics part was a bit of
a shame if it was a bit shorter or
standard size it would have fit real
easy lengthwise it wasn't great but it
did fit but yeah definitely 170 mil no
dramas but I was 178 mil so that extra 8
mil made it difficult but as I said
ultimately it was the height of the card
so as you can see the standard height
would see the card end there so it's a
good 20 properly mil taller than it
should be which is kind of a kind of a
bizarre decision there by MSI because
they could have that well the reason
they've done it is their heat pipes come
out the top of the heatsink and come
back yeah but they could have easily
done it underneath because there's you
can't really see it with this thing
apart
okay so there's the card and you can see
the extra PCB on top and you can see
that the connector is very close to the
top of the card if they had of offset
that up a bit further down it would have
fit we would have got away with it
basically if it was another 10 mil down
and looking at the PCB design they could
have easily done that but as I said for
most cases this will fit no dramas so
can I go too hard on him aside for that
one here's the cooler and you can see
this big single six mil copper heat pipe
could have easily come out the bottom of
the card
run along there and gone up that way and
it would have made the what would even
that would be about the same length but
you could have made this shorter and
then they could have made it a more
compact car instead of making it taller
so I've noticed MSI's sort of go
tendency to make cards triple slot that
really shouldn't be triple-triple slot
or cards like this Toula and they really
need to be anyway probably should have
done a bit more research so ultimately
that's my fault
where did you put that display Paul you
gave it to me yeah you put on top of the
screws did you flip the PSU switch
before closing the case ah where is it
yeah I did it looks like it's flipped
from factory at least that is the tin
did you flip your switch turned on about
the LED and everything right excellent
guesswork looks like it's posted what's
going on did everything pop up on the
screen I didn't say no signal mmm well
that is disappointing but it did
something do you come up yeah I think it
was just the
I'm just saying if there's any clues in
chat ah that is so embarrassing
what nothing I definitely didn't plug it
into the motherboard and not the
graphics card I'm trying to a debate
team here otherwise you could take me
another hour to get this working okay I
think I think we're in business
now that I've got the cables and the
right holes come on yes Safa team i won
now all I need is a keyboard so I can
see if it's idling at 80 degrees or
something crazy like that but yeah I
think I think we're good
it's just cycling new by us we're all
good all good I'm gonna keyboard laying
around anyway No
Oh found some replacements for our power
supply
screws on the outside but fewer yep
actually I might sit around this side
for a brief moment just I can see what
you're doing so as it turns out I've
just got to take this apart to put in my
front USB that's it yeah I'm kind of
annoyed
we are in the bought ups
that's what do you want don't like how
do we get rid of that message cpu type
29 that seems pretty good for idle
that's probably a cup probably 23 also
degrades in this room um cool it was is
there an easy way to get rid this
message Jim which one I'll just press
the there's a direct I'll just do it
there's a direction
yeah how's the fan noise I don't know
how all the guys can be a bit so far
it's very quiet but it's only an idle of
course Betty bybel that's almost silent
it's good very very quiet
cool possibly need to update the BIOS on
this thing not sure 780 yeah I'll
configure that later main thing is it
turns on its you're all happy I'm pretty
happy yes sir
I'm smashing the Nek you're right Jared
I was going for the Nek like my life
depended on it why what's the clicking
the clicking was the mechanical keyboard
which has blue switches by the sounds of
it or a look of it yeah I think the idle
temperatures fine but yeah at a later
date we'll do a follow-up video where we
stress both systems and see what
temperature's we get and all that sort
of stuff we won't be doing any
overclocking on these motherboards
because mostly it doesn't really make
sense to do you pay for your monitor
testing equipment and software
um the Hardware year the software
there's an agreement that we have with
Kalman who or spectra Cal food makes Cal
man and yes so don't end up having to
pay for that which is good because the
software cost thousands of dollars about
the hardware year
yeah I used to the GTX 1050 how powerful
so this is a CL 15 kit so if we back the
timings off a little bit we should be
able to get the frequency up if it's
worth doing mr. power connector Louis
okay that's one extra cable I can get
rid of from here
PCI pivot GPU you don't eat it oh yeah
you don't I
you could probably well you can is it
hard to get back enough you pull it up
not really
let's find them I do need
well I just hit that memory it's a 3200
and it's at least it's got into the bass
don't know how stable it is but it works
at 3200 CL 15 pretty good pretty good
it's not super high end memory or
anything like that but yeah I think it's
pretty affordable actually though it is
a 32 gigabyte kit so it's 2 16 gigabyte
modules do liking everything in at this
point we that all how you dealing with
screw are you just leaving this I'm just
leaving low for now I'll get some proper
screws later because I don't want to
screw them in any further yeah and I
cheated I'm not done yet we mean I
haven't put the front of these cables
don't make my mistake hopefully after I
plug these and still powers on
have one of those three bottles on the
background looks like protein stuff yeah
it's Tim's protein shakes it's a it's
Powerade Tim reckons it helps him when
he's feeling sick so whatever works Tim
whatever works
I'm glad Tim was able to do this stream
today because it wasn't looking good
yesterday we had planned this for Monday
yeah no one would be sick for but yeah
Tim has been the sink so that didn't
happen I might take a timely cable tie
some stuff as well while I've got it
open okay
so this goes in here I'm actually got a
bit of spare space over this side of the
case you have to do this last because I
don't know how well you guys can see
this but there's the power cord into the
power supply and this sits right behind
it so once you put this in you can't get
the power cord out of the power supply
more you have to take this out so make
sense to leave that to last you just
screwed in my power supply whatever sure
is blocking the path yeah it is
okay there we go now I've just gotta try
and hide this cable a bit better I'm
gonna wrap it around this area because
it goes in just here at least it's in a
convenient spot on the motherboard the
USB 3 ever and I gotta try and Bend that
cave with that break and the connector
seems convenient the cable is pretty
long
the cables far too long but there you go
that wasn't too much effort done so now
I get the lid back on test out those
ports work or at least gives power to a
thumb drive or something I was gonna I
was going to tweezer those so let's do
that
now I don't have anything safe to cut
them with Jimmy scissors or anything I
really want to use their new around here
and they got any scissors screw up a
point for okay we're getting there guys
how do you install should I probably
look at these what oh okay this can be
installed oh yeah
well yeah just click seeing right and
then you can tighten it I don't know I
think so
does it ever school in the other side no
it doesn't it's just a pin someone is
having some car troubles at the front ot
misplace yeah I'm gonna go with that
that'll work it makes sense if I had to
reinstall this about six times forget it
right
yeah Tim's getting there I've got to do
tables now that's it everything's okay
to some degree what am I looking for
where are those little screws go on you
know I'm saved a little bit of actually
I'm actually a decent amount of space in
between hearing between the cooler and
this graphics card so I can yours look
sweets feed some cables up there for
need some need some management space in
there benefit of having this slope GPU
in here my case door went on bed up the
second time I think I've compacted
everything in nicely now everything
knows where it belongs all right there
we go we've got our feet on we've got a
USBs I've put them down the bottom you
could put this either way really
graphics card a top it's looking pretty
good I think think I am done I might
clean up a bit of this mess and then
I'll read some questions or comments
yeah this is my new personal laptop okay
I kept from tech showdowns in here how's
it going care hope you're doing well and
he's busy with his new channel cool I'll
just put all of this stuff in this so
now there is a bracket for the graphics
cards announced a bit better but yeah
there's only two phase four isn't it
yeah there's probably one down there
under that expansion okay so I'll go
over a few things just quickly for some
other guys that wondered why we're using
the 2700 X and not the 99 or okay and
I'll rewind back to the stats these are
going to be editing rigs for Computex
the last few years I've taken a big huge
workstation laptop it's been so big that
it hasn't really been practical to use
on the plane so I've taken my razor
stealth thing cuz that's much better for
watching movies and doing whatever you
do on the plane so I've had to take two
laptops anyway
Tim and I take a 27-inch monitor because
it's nice big has a 1440p or 4k
resolution the laptops were usually only
1080p and 4k or whatever on a tiny
screens not great so last year we took a
mechanical keyboard a mouse a 27-inch
screen and then a big workstation laptop
and I thought it'd be and the Lapp my
laptop was only a quad-core with 16 gig
of ram so it was pretty crap for video
editing pretty crap for encoding and I
said to Tim last year I'm gonna build a
mini ITX rig next year with like a 8
core rise and or something and bring
that then these cases arrived and I
thought I'll do that and then I was
tossing up do I get a 9900 K or
2700 X basically they don't recommend
using a nineteen are okay in this case
because it runs so hot of course you can
limit it to the 95 watt TDP and then it
should be okay but you're sacrificing a
lot of performance there in the end it
was like do we go 2700 X or do we go
nighty-night okay and for us the
ultimate deciding factor there was the
fact that we could basically get to 2700
X chips for the price of one 1900 K so
it was like $60 extra for the 2700 X's
over a single night diner okay so we
just went with the 2700 processors
because if we have to limit the 1900 to
the 95 watt TDP these are going to be as
fast or faster anyway and when it comes
to encoding and all that basically when
they're both fully Unleashed performance
is very similar so it was going to cost
us seventeen hundred and sixty
Australian dollars for two nights not
hurricanes or 940 for a pair of 2700 X's
so we went with the AMD CPU and probably
going to be a smarter choice for this
system anyway we also get the B 450
motherboard so if we keep these for
Computex next year we could probably put
as n 2 processor on there and get a bit
more performance so that's why we went
with the AMD processor no other reasons
really so that's that any questions or
comments about that alright so here you
put them in the correct way Jessie right
correct way guessing I think I still
know what they were yes Pier one
how dare you be budget conscious I'm a
really good probably an even more
sensible combo if this if you're only
doing a live video editing would be
something like a rise in 5 2600 X or
even a 2600 for the 65 watt TDP that
would be really good as well but we
thought just going the 2700 X why not
get those two extra cores and there will
it will speed up those 4k
renders that's for sure what is the next
unboxing boxes I don't have one
scheduled at the moment because I have
nothing in one box
so unboxing boxes is one of those things
that really obviously need things to
unbox and the last one I left too long
and I had too much to unbox but right
now I haven't really had nothing
interesting come in so yeah I mean it
could happen in the next few weeks if I
get a heap of stuff come in or it could
be a month or so but I'll do it as soon
as I can because I have fun making that
series and a pretty slow period at the
moment it's very slow enough to to
compute X yeah so that's yeah it's it's
hard to do an episode when I don't have
things to take out of boxes ah gee the
comments are coming in pretty quick wait
for rise in 3000 yeah at this point if
you were paying for all this stuff and
you didn't have to build it for Computex
and it makes sense to wait till after
Computex to see what gets announced and
and then obviously wait for reviews to
see what what's what basically in a few
months time it's almost certain you'll
be able to get something much better for
similar money Steve what do you think of
the 2600 x4 1080p video editing the 2600
X will be fine for 4k the the editing
part doesn't matter so much it's more
how long it takes to render encourage
the video but for video editing it's
perfectly fine it's pretty much
identical of the 2700 X as far as I'm
aware unless you do a lot of maybe warp
stabilisation kind of stuff the extra
cores will probably allow you to do a
few other things while that's taking
place what else we got here I'm not
actually sure where we would fit maybe
you could like do some sort of mod here
or something or maybe they've got
something planned actually you can screw
in a two and a half inch drive over the
back of the graphics card there so we
might better get a two terabyte SSD on
the back of the graphics card for four
videos what else we got here yeah I am
for socket that's AMD have said that the
am for socket they said this when they
first released the original horizon
series the horizon 7 1800 X and
in 1700 they said they're committed to
the a.m. for soccer until at least 2020
I believe they'll keep using that socket
till ddr5 comes along so yeah and I know
there's been a bit of controversy with
support for the upcoming Zen to process
on existing 300 400 series boards but
really there's no reason why they
shouldn't so I think we will see and I
think most of the biases from a soos and
gigabyte and I think even as Rockets
started rolling out so support there
shouldn't be a problem
man you guys are so great thanks for
spending time with us hey you're welcome
you guys are so great for watching us so
I think it's more on you guys but anyway
we're more than happy to do it it's a
lot of fun gtx 1650 is garbage because
of the price yeah I mean well yeah
garbage is a bit harsh but it just
doesn't make sense at $150 u.s. it
doesn't make sense for the argument
people make for using it and OAM systems
and whatever a hundred dollars it's a to
be a great product that's a 33% discount
basically to be a good product yeah yeah
a company replaces for you don't think I
have any that's fine it works
mine's done so I'll change those screws
later we don't have to give it 100% just
prove it works are you gonna take this
after this what my system your system my
system why yeah well if you're gonna
change the screws I don't have any so
yeah I can take it and I'll bring it
back are we doing another live patreon
livestream before we go to Computex we
would be wouldn't we I think so yeah I
was gonna put this on it I think I'm
done all right all right fillet it works
ah there we go
you still like the be 450 gaming Pro
Cathy I missed that comment and I can't
scroll back up but yeah I still like the
MSI be 450 boards if that's what the
question was
they're still pretty much the best going
around
what else we got here I'm trying to keep
up you guys are typing too much stuff
Steve was correctly harsh on the 1650
yeah I mean I didn't want to bash it for
no reason but just price to performance
it doesn't make sense and I think the
main takeaway there is if you're
building a new computer or you're
upgrading a relatively new computer then
it just doesn't make sense to get one
it's it's that simple really and as I
said if you're coming to market with a
product to replace a three year old
product it kinda has to be better in
more areas than just one especially if
that area is just power consumption I
actually have an under vaulting rx 570
piece coming up so yeah I could get
pretty close to the efficiency of the
1650 with that three old card that was
pretty shocking but I'll have that on
the channel probably next week yeah
Tim's in the process of moving as we
sort of said a lot of these sets packed
up he'll be packing up pretty much the
rest of it the next day or so and then
Tim will be getting out content as he
can but of course he's moving house
rebuilding a set so that's gonna slow
Tim down a bit so the channel probably
won't be doing a video every day for a
while yep reviews that the only one
Steve brought up to tested pay so you've
got a review of that coming mm-hmm by
request of you guys by this Kay said
what type of GPU we're going to put me
Steve well we were putting GTX 1660s in
them the 1660 is a good value GPU I'd
quite like it no problem with that one
we were using it mostly because that's
all MSI had available for us in the
region so we thought yeah beggars can't
be choosers
but yeah the card turned out to be too
tall so as sort of a makeshift make-do
situation at the moment tim has a three
gigabyte 1050 and I have a Radeon r9
nano so the system works with those and
it probably won't make too much
difference to what we're doing but
before we go to Computex we'll probably
give these cards back to MSI and see if
they've got something better for us and
we'll go from there
and we'll do an updated video on how
these systems handle with the new
graphics cards maybe we'll get the same
model we'll probably try and get two
different models and see Andy a video I
reckon yeah we'll work something out but
that should make for an interesting
video on the channel in the next few
weeks yeah so I think I'll give I'll be
giving this to you so you can sort all
that stuff out yeah well I'll take care
of a team oh yeah my final system you
can see my cable management here is is
that fantastic as you can see the I like
the this spaghetti section here I'm a
big fan of this spaghetti just
connectors flying around the place that
that's all fine obviously and then yeah
just gonna try and try to do the usual
squish method yeah yeah after getting
the trick is to get those around so you
want a cable tie then there if you can't
makes getting the case on the cable ties
obviously yeah tweezers yeah yeah yeah
sorry get your toys as going yeah
Tim's cable management is better yes
it's better look when you see a nice
bowl of noodles this is what I was going
for here I want the noodle look go when
we put this we'll have to do a
comparison the mine's definitely better
than that of the moment I've got the 24
pin cable stuff down there yours is just
over the seat I'm genuinely upset about
that comment what's your opinion about
the asrock fatality k for gaming be 450
regarding overclocking I don't require I
think it's quite fine for overclocking
probably not the best board the MSI's
it's been pros better it's interesting
to me that there's this Vatel section
that is meant to come in contact or very
close to contact with the aluminium
backplate of a graphics card two helmets
to help use this as like a heat spreader
I thought if you wanted to put the the
SSD say here this is going to stop you
from doing that
true true it'd be good if you could
remove it because yeah that said the SSD
would get pretty baked even the non RGB
ones to get baked when you wait because
the back of those graphics cards gets
mighty hot especially the higher end
ones the backplate what dude one is like
some sort of site er to end on to type
things so you could sort of swell it
like there another MDOT to because this
board on years one right
you could quite easily fit one there
story yeah I don't know ribbon cables
with those latency might be a bit of a
pain not sure
sure anyway I mean they're not file
servers basically this is something that
you would put at your TV or wherever if
it's sort of a home theater sort of set
up and then you would use an ass or a
file server for streaming stuff from
basically yeah you just might do some
tweezing
yeah you do get tweeze ring around all
right some more comments
ah what else we got here
oh she don't want a tweezer if it if it
doesn't work so I mean no well that that
should be fine
that should be fine really I don't know
if that was stopping here that needs to
be dealt with a bit better can you
please make a rise and hackintosh to
people do hackintosh as still is that
still a thing I don't know I don't
personally want to if a lot of you guys
wanted to see what I guess I'd make Tim
do that video Sam will take core v1
value bill please that is a super easy
case to work with the core of e1 and it
is a really good value case RTX Titan is
perfect for 480p hmm well so we got here
Tim please take enough rest you look
sick Tim is pretty sick yes
but he's been sick for about a week now
so he's on Friday which there was no
news corner yeah last week there won't
be one this week either because of
removal
yep so Tim was kind of over being sick
and he thought now I'm gonna do some
work he was sick of me also caring the
channel so he's a suck that up today and
done the livestream but this has been a
bit of fun and Tim's hanging in there so
you should be alright I might have to do
the patreon livestream by myself later
if Tim passes they are I'm actually
feeling fine it's just my voice is kind
of very need more power aid that was one
of the comments there
I go for a twenty eighty now twenty
eighty in this build would be pretty
cool but I'm not sure if he was
addressing someone else there yeah so I
think that's um I'm up to speed with the
comments I can read anyway they're
flying up pretty quickly and we can't
scroll back because well we haven't got
a mouse huh
that's handy it's over there use wd-40 I
could have used a wd-40 to slide to that
original graphics card him that would
have actually worked quite well had I
thought of it it's not usually my go-to
thing though for PC building wishing Tim
all the best a lot of Tim love here
during about Tim you'll be fine now my
usual luck with these things is that
this would work yeah I'm just going to
grab some water quickly so you know once
a Powerade right yeah so I'm fairly
confident this isn't going to work
typically what I build a system I'm not
super familiar with the first time I'm
gonna stop something up in there and us
livestream it's not a wife do something
doesn't go wrong right I hope it doesn't
work I hope it does work I don't think
it will I mean I'm pretty amazed mine
didn't I only forgot the USB three
things that's not too bad yeah I think
probably certainly thought liquid cooler
that's usually you know water stats
well it wouldn't sprout aside start
dripping out but it'd be good if it did
sprout the side that'd be quite funny
yeah
the liquid core at some point it looked
okay to me should have used the game as
a nexus anti-static map I've got the big
mod map - Steve gave me one of the
original ones and it's awesome I have it
at home it's up in the benchmark lab I
use it all the time really cool those
gamers Nexus mod math yeah I should have
brought up we could have protected your
table with it but I didn't think that
well ahead did I need this table needs a
bit of a reap yeah a bit of a surface
treatment tuchis yeah I've definitely
never stored it this long for a video I
can tell you that much
it's weird they give you a black one of
these with the grey
yeah that is weird I kind of kind of
goes together well though but that is
weird
but it doesn't does look alright I think
maybe I think these are early production
runs though so yeah well you don't
really need to worry about just do that
I undo those screws because the screws
go through the whole lot to hold it on
oh do they well my I did that was mine I
didn't think they were long enough mine
mine did fine so yeah maybe you're not
meant to I don't know I did it works
really well so yeah it's worked well for
me but yeah because we haven't read the
manual we have no idea so but as I said
this is certainly not a build god it's
just a bit of fun hopefully you guys are
enjoying first-ever live firing on the
tram the PC let's test this alright I'll
put mine back here
Gosei it's heavy
that's my white limit on the plane bring
what Finn is definitely not sitting
flush with the thing yeah it'll take it
a bit this way it a lot
it'll be alright I have some of my
unbranded liquid I'm gonna put this in
the graphics card so look at me learning
from my mistakes and one thing is I
definitely didn't plug in the power led
me well we don't even know if your power
come on oh you looked up the manual yeah
I put the power cord in the right place
I think well yeah your LED lighting
doesn't work no implant I just said I
didn't plug that in I wasn't listening
he's the fan look that's making this air
getting sucked all through its getting
air sucked through here and it's coming
out there
sorry cool yeah it's quite a lot of yeah
here we go
damn it it works well that's
disappointing damn fully working is it
me smoking though yeah I think so
what's it doing sounds like it seems
like it's locked up can you press any
buttons I'll try y'all control delete
worked I'll see if I get the boss okay
well it's nice and quiet can you see the
UM all the liquid cooler can you guys
see that looks pretty cool actually oh
there we go in the boss yeah looks
pretty much like online work look idling
at a billion degrees is it we set up no
same as mine
you haven't screwed anything up I'm sure
well well my first build of the year I
would have liked to be dude well haven't
I've got a few other builds planned for
the channel but yeah just haven't spent
busy focusing on the games at the start
of the year and then monitors now cuz
I've got like it's got like ten ten to
twenty ten over ten monitors I got at
once to review because all the companies
like Yankee have some monitors I'm like
yeah sure I want to review this and then
it comes to the point where I'm like
hang on a moment
I actually have to review all these on
the channel at some point I'm in
somewhere so that's kind of been the
project over the past couple weeks
there's a few more to go
well this Ram seems pretty good
see how 15 3333 not us I don't know what
it'll go to before it doesn't work of
course we're not stress testing it first
ability right I think but I mean the
fact that purse is pretty good yeah
all right it's locked up did ya you say
3200 is the limit there without
adjusting any timings so anyway that's
probably to be expected but yeah Tim's
works so yeah I've been hoping for some
excitement on the stream some
controversy it's yeah look I'm sorry you
know if I just got sick on the strain
that's whatever one right not megamix no
don't do megamix yes I mean these cases
were pretty easy to work with if you do
your research beforehand and get the
right components like I was really
interested to sort of see being of my
first mini ITX type build how difficult
would be with TL the cables and stuffing
but I think if you could get a good
graphics card without the power
connector that did help free a bit of
space but the the sizing of that colors
world well then good the power connector
on the Nano was fine yeah there's heaps
of room and stuff yeah it's the height
there's heaps of room in the top of the
case for getting the power connector in
but it has to be a standard height card
so but disappointing the Aero isn't but
we'll see if MSI has anything else we
can use yeah we can fit longer cards in
there if you go for a low profile err
CPU cool yeah it'll take a full length
card basically if you go for an
air-cooled it's pretty neat case really
our priority though was CPU performance
yes so rather than graphics card
21:33 2133 isn't the memory speed that's
just what happens when you don't load
XMP and your boot up for the first time
so it is 3000 spec memory which is fine
especially cell 15 that's pretty good
stuff very cost-effective but yeah when
you load up any new system at defaults
to the base spec which is 21 33 for ddr4
and I think it's even by 21 33 ddr4
these days
very yeah you'd be just the same well
this is any other that's right that's
right it's been really crap been stuff
yeah if you guys have any questions feel
free to drop them in otherwise we'll
probably wrap this up I don't know how
long we've been going for over two hours
Wow okay so what we said it might a port
of thought two hours would be about
where we'd end up and well apparently we
have can't see that what where is the
timer it's a tiny bit of text in OBS in
the bottom right two hours and 50
seconds oh okay well there you go and so
you guys thanks for watching but you
next time I am very hungry this is gonna
be a light lunch
so yeah has there been any questions if
I missed anything I'm not really paying
attention you too focused on your net
how's the weather the weather has
actually been really good today was
meant to be terrible we're going to have
thunderstorms and everything we thought
that's gonna be pretty loud for the
livestream like that last night yeah the
weather's been good today
so it was really nice yesterday a nice
stream thanks guys thanks to everyone
who tuned in and watched big thank you
to anyone who watched all two hours
that's pretty impressive yeah definitely
and yeah if you guys really enjoyed this
then maybe we can aim to do this sort of
thing once every month or to do a
different system each month maybe a
1080p budget build and we could go from
it from two different angles so they're
not the exact same systems next yeah if
we each organized our parts we just
don't don't speak to each other that
could be pretty cool be very interesting
to see would we come up with the same
system under the same budget or what
would happen yeah that could be kind of
cool maybe we'll do that next month
or after Computex just get your place
set for life streaming a bit we want to
know your height Steve I'm not super
taller I think I'm six one so yeah yeah
510 which is why you look taller than me
yeah so my head only gets chopped off if
I sorta jump you were doing that before
this dream for some reason I was like
yeah where's my head out am I in am I in
but yeah Tim Tim said of that fine
yes I'm six one yeah which I thinks
whatever
pretty normal height Tim's
shorter but whatever Steve read three of
my comments and I'm happy well I'm glad
I could make your day Lois and thank you
for making three comments much
appreciated yeah I think there's too
many more questions coming in but yes so
that was that was it that uh that's our
live stream bills my first ever live
stream on harbor and box which is pretty
surprising that I've been running the
channel for so long hosting on the child
for so long we haven't done something
you've done one or two before yeah I've
done so I've I did a a I think it was my
night member my nights the other hundred
K test system or 8700 K or something
like that
mhm I built live that was there was a
few issues game that one running up but
I think you've got a bit more practice
in and then there was also the twenty
atti
48 hour stream which YouTube
incidentally has screwed up and you
can't watch never got processed yeah yes
that we need to oblivion and for family
whatever it wasn't the most entertaining
stream yeah I think you know doing the
patreon streams sort of we now know how
to do it we've worked out a few things
you did you did well with this that's
not an easy build to do for your first
build for the year or your first mini
ITX build yeah so it's good alright this
case yeah I'm really keen do I get it
home and set it up properly put the
right screws in tidied up a bit and yeah
do some follow-up content with it but
yeah it's a really cool case very
expensive it is very unique though which
is why they're charging a premium for it
I suppose and it's not like a huge mass
production thing as I said it's a
crowd-funded case so you can find them
on IndieGoGo we'll check the links and
stuff in the description once the the
stream ends beer comes in the gray color
which I reckon looks pretty awesome or
the black but yeah yours is the gray one
so we won't confuse the two yeah but
anyway thanks to everyone who tuned in
and watched
we've got more content coming up on the
channel later this week
yeah few things few monitor reviews few
benchmark videos so Q knows will be
going up next couple of days then next
week yeah a few more reviews on my end
you've got some
stuff coming up so yeah I put a few
different random pieces I want to do
that that Dell Optiplex build with the
1650 versus the rx 560 and 1050 nights
sort of stuff that'll be interesting I
bought one of those Kingston RGB SSD so
see what the hell's going on with those
things so on still windows on that crank
the LEDs that run a few tests and yeah
see what the deal is they're cool and
then there's a bit other benchmark
things planned so yeah stay tuned for
that
anyway thanks for watching if you want
to see our patreon live streams which is
similar to this but it's just me and Tim
sitting there answering questions and
talking crap with you guys that's a lot
of fun you can sign up I think what's
that two dollars a dollar isn't it yeah
yeah it's a dollar if you watch if you
want to watch our monthly live streams
it's one dollar a month that what is it
two dollars to get no discord chat or
something like that and three dollars
for behind the scenes stuff so it's not
expensive that's us dollars each month
and yeah anyway otherwise you can just
it to the main channel stuff which we
very much appreciate you and we'll see
you again next time
yep so yeah I've actually leaned over
here and the stream</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
