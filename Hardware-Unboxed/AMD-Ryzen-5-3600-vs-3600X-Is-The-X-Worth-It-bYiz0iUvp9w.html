recently I purchased the risin 5 3,600
for review and I found it to be a
cracking good deal in short it murdered
the 9600 k in core heavy productivity
benchmarks and it was right there for
the gaming tests as well often offering
better 1% low performance all while
costing notably less without a doubt the
most asked question coming away from
that video was should I buy the rise in
536 hundred or the 3600 X so to answer
that question I went out and I purchased
a 3600 X and we're gonna put it to the
test now add a guess I'd say it's not
worth it because we saw the same thing
when comparing the 2600 the 2600 X even
the 1600 and the 1600 X but we don't
like to guess here at higher on box so
let's go run some benchmarks before that
though a quick rundown in regards to how
these two CPUs compare on paper whereas
the 3600 comes clocked at 3.62 Hertz for
the base and 4.2 gigahertz for the boost
the 3,600 X runs 200 megahertz faster at
3.8 gigahertz and then four point four
gigahertz for the boost so a 6% base
clock increase and a 5% Bruce clock
increase the only other change in
specifications can be seen when looking
at the TDP the 3600 is a 65 watt part
and the 3600 X is a 95 watt part as such
the 3600 gets the 65 watt raised stealth
box cooler and the 3600 X gets the 95
watt Wraith spire box cooler as for
pricing the base model 3600 comes in at
$200 u.s. while the 3600 x cost 25% more
at 250 dollars u.s. quite a big markup
there for the X model so it'll be
interesting to see what it has to offer
both CPUs have been tested on the
gigabyte x5 17 horas extreme with 16
gigabytes of G skills flair exterior for
3200 cell 14 memory and the graphics
card of choice for the CPU test is of
course the GeForce r-tx 2080 Ti so let's
get into the numbers first up we have
Cinebench azar 20 multi-core tests and
here we see a very mild 2% increase in
performance with a 3600 x over the
vanilla 3600 very underwhelming
and it doesn't exactly justify the 25%
price hike meanwhile the single core
performance is an increase of just 3%
going from 481 points to 497 points then
moving along to premier and here we see
the biggest performance gain yet as the
3600 X reduced the render time by 5%
taking five hundred and thirteen seconds
opposed to five hundred and thirty nine
seconds not exactly a big deal though so
let's just move on and see if we can
find any bigger margins elsewhere
this time the 3,600 X reduced the render
time by just 4% when testing with
blender and at this point you're
probably starting to question why we
need two of these six core 12 threads n2
based CPUs anyway moving on to games and
yeah not much to say here either
the 3600 and 3600 X basically delivered
identical performance in Assassin's
Creed Odyssey the 3600 X was up to 2%
faster which equates to a 2 FPS
difference at most and we see the same
thing in battlefield 5 the 3600 X was
again up to 2 FPS faster than the non ex
model so basically the same performance
were still we only see a 1 FPS
difference in the division - and I
should note that the 3600 X and 3600 do
match the 3700 X in this title and we
also saw a similar thing when testing
with battlefield 5 and Assassin's Creed
Odyssey having said all that the 3700 X
does offer a small performance boost
over 3600 X and shut off the Tomb Raider
but the 3600 X was only up to 3% faster
than the 3600 so it's pretty clear by
this point that in terms of performance
the thirty six hundred and thirty six
hundred x are basically the same even
when it comes to power draw there's
virtually no difference between the two
the 3600 X increased total system
assumption by just four percent when
measuring total power draw from the wall
and that's interesting given that the
thermal watt rating increased by 46% to
the 3600 X surely it's not chucking out
that much more heat I know that's not
exactly what that rating means but let's
move on to see how they compare using
the Box coolers so here we're looking at
how the 3600 X compares with its 95 watt
Wraith spire box cooler to the 30
600 with its 65 watt Wraith stealth box
cooler and we're doing so using the
blender stress test stock we see the
3600 hit 80 degrees and then we see the
3600 X around 2 degrees cooler at 78
degrees but it achieved this will also
run in 100 megahertz higher so a two and
a half percent increase in frequency
then with PBO plus order SC enabled and
the risin master software the 3600 hit
84 degrees but only around 25 megahertz
faster while the 3800 acts hit 84
degrees but ran 50 megahertz faster for
a 3% increase over the 3600 then out of
interest I tested both CPUs with the
race spire and Wraith stealth box
schools to see how the temperatures
compared in short using either cooler
the 3600 X ran six degrees hotter and he
can expect some throttling with the
stealth cooler so let's rerun these
tests again with the corsair h 115 i Pro
installed so with a quality all-in-one
liquid cooler installed we find
something very interesting and that is
almost no difference between the two
CPUs temperatures were exactly the same
and clock speeds but also basically
identical in fact the 3600 maintained a
slightly better PB o frequency in our
test though I wouldn't read too much
into that there's a good chance of
around this test enough times with
enough CPUs we'd find on average that
there is no difference in operating
frequencies between these two parts and
before wrapping this up let's just have
another look at power usage this time
focusing on CPU package power and core
current using the included box cooler we
see virtually no difference in power
draw between a 3,600 X and 3600 and the
same is also true when using an
aftermarket cooler so is the risin 5
3600 x worth purchasing over the 3600
well obviously no and other than to
improve AMD's margins there's absolutely
no reason for the 3600 x to exist sure
you do get a better box cooler but
you're paying $50 more for that cooler
and it's simply not worth that kind of
price premium $10 yes sure but anything
more than that $20 or more now not worth
it
rather than waste $50 on the 3600 x just
get the 3600 and if you want to reduce
the operating volume and
squeeze a tiny bit more performance out
of it then grab something like the
cooler master 212 black for $40 I
suspect the reason this contents been so
heavily requested by you guys is again
due to the misleading TDP rating the
only thing that makes the 3600 are 65
watt TDP part is the 65 watt cooler
while the 3600 Xers are 95 watt TDP part
because it comes with a 95 watt cooler
you could basically swap the coolers
around and then reverse the results the
3600 becomes a 3600 ex with the Wraith
spire and the 3600 X becomes a 3600 with
the Wraith stealth AMD has explained how
they calculate the TDP for their Zen to
processes in the review guide but it
doesn't really help address this issue
as there are variables that we still
don't know such as the optimal operating
temperature for each part and while I
could ask AMD for those figures in the
end doesn't really matter as both CPUs
are essentially the same as our testing
shows the only difference being the base
and boost clocks which on paper differ
by up to 6% something I haven't talked
about yet is manual overclocking I know
there will be some viewers who claim a
3600 X is a bend part in there for will
overclock better than the 3600 however
from my one sample test that wasn't the
case both were limited to four point two
gigahertz at one point three five volt
and while both could boot into Windows
at four point three gigahertz using one
point four volts
they found even the most basic stress
test so there's not much more to say on
this one I highly recommend avoiding the
3600 X and instead just grab the 3600
and then if you find it necessary to
upgrade the Box cooler you can do so
with something better anyway that is
