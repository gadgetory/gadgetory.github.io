for testing we have the new gigabyte or
r-tx 2082 i extreme and as you can see
this is a nice big high-end graphics
card and you might be thinking well why
does such a big high end graphics card
have such a small box seriously look at
the size of this thing you could put an
x3 not it on motherboard perhaps even
two of them in this thing absolutely
huge but as impressive as this big box
is the card itself is much more
impressive I'm willing to say this is
probably definitely the best-looking
r-tx model available right now and well
if you don't believe me check out this
footage of course you have to somewhat
enjoy our GB lighting but I think even
the haters will admit the effects are
pretty impressive with this one
gigabytes RGB game certainly has been on
point over the years and I absolutely
loved their RGB PCIe slots they used on
their motherboards sadly though they
seemed to have abandoned those now
anyway this new RGB lighting method
really is incredible and it actually
looks better than what I've shown in the
b-roll it's quite difficult to match the
camera shutter speed to really show the
lighting effect how it looks true to
life how appears in the flesh and it
does look a little bit better first hand
so keep that in mind it does look quite
cool in the b-roll I've already seen the
b-roll looks quite good but even better
in person so if you're after
flashy RGB effects and this card really
is a must-have item because I haven't
seen anything quite like it
still as fantastic as the RGB lighting
is we're probably more concerned with
how the card actually performs from
things like frame rates to the thermal
performance so I will be hitting the
Auris extreme with our usual battery of
tests to see how it stacks up against
other recently released r-tx
2080 graphics cards 20 atti graphics
cards that is such as in videos found
edition and MSI's gaming extra oh it's
quite hard to remember all these models
and their names but yeah the MSI's
gaming extra
probably the best model we've seen so
far today's video sponsor is PCB way if
you're after a custom PCB for your next
project look no further they make high
quality PCBs at affordable prices right
now new members get a $5 bonus which
covers their first order of ten one to
two layer
PCBs and they also offer an assembly
service furthermore right now all PCB
assembly orders enjoy free shipping
worldwide so check them out link is in
the video description before we get to
the results I just like to go over the
cards physical design and appearance
it measures 29 centimeters long thirteen
point four centimeters taller and six
centimeters wide making it a triple slot
card all up it weighs in at one thousand
four hundred and two grams which
actually makes it 16% lighter than the
MSI gaming extroversion out of the box
the card looks reasonably impressive and
by out of the box I mean without it all
lit up and taking advantage of those
glorious high GPF X the plastic fan
shroud has some nice silver aluminium
trimmings and there are three 100
millimeter fans that look quite
interesting particularly the center fan
the outer fans have the underside of the
tips removed whereas the top side of the
center fan has been cut out so it looks
very unusual and this allows the fans to
overlap providing greater airflow
coverage over the heatsink in order to
avoid the turbulent air that this stack
design would create the center fan spins
in an alternate direction and then
finally to maximize endurance the fans
feature double ball bearings moving
around to the back side of the card we
find a large aluminium backplate
featuring a large LED backlit Horace
logo which is of course RGB LED backlit
it weighs in at 124 grams and on the
underside features three high quality
thermal pads which extract heat from the
backside of the PCB namely behind the
GDD are six memory chips this is an
important design aspect of the card and
as you'll see later there is a serious
amount of heat to deal with here moving
around to the i/o panel we find three
DisplayPort 1.4 outputs and three HDMI
2.0 B outputs along with a USB type-c
port with virtual link support this is
actually quite an impressive array of
outputs the MSI
next row for example only offers a
single HDMI port along with its three
display ports okay so I think we've
looked at the card externally enough I
think it's time to take it apart and get
a good look at what's under that cooler
and thankfully it's a pretty easy
process to do this there's just ten
screws in total on the backside and then
a fare the four screws on the top side
if you want to completely remove that
back plate as well there's actually
almost as many cables as there are
screws
well not quite those five in total but
that's still quite a few cables for a
graphics card so it's worth being aware
of that if you do want to strip it down
for whatever reason though I doubt
you're gonna want to throw this cooler
away to replace it the waterblock so
taking off the cooler reveals a large
PCB and here we find a few interesting
things the highlight here though is the
power delivery design which sees sixteen
phases for the GPU and three phases for
the GDD r6 memory and feeding power into
the card is a pair of eight pin PCIe
power connectors the cooler itself
accounts for 940 grams of the cards
total weight and 115 grams of that is
the plastic shroud that goes around the
fans this then means the heatsink and
fans weigh 825 grams in total there are
seven copper heat pipes all of which
come in direct contact with the GPU and
then also connected the fin stacks or a
number of aluminium plates which you use
to extract heat from the GDD r6 memory
and vrm components ok so before we move
on to talk about the factory clock
speeds the overclocking performance of
the card and of course thermals and
let's put the Auris r-tx 28 ECI extreme
back together and check out those RGB
lighting effects firing up the RGB
fusion software we find 13 different
effects and for the most part you can
adjust things like speed brightness and
color it's also possible to save
profiles to your PC and gigabyte has
even included a few presets with some
very nice effects I really liked the
tricolor effect on for this one gigabyte
has included a really awesome looking
light blue blue and pink preset that
looks just absolutely amazing using
solid colors for the pulse and flashing
effects looks pretty good as well I
won't go over all the effects as there
are quite a few of them we'd be here for
ages going over all of them but there
are a good number of really impressive
effects and they can be fully customized
to
your build moving on the clock speeds it
out of the box the boost clock has been
set at seventeen hundred and seventy
megahertz which is an eight percent
increase over the founders edition model
which is also overclocked to sixteen
hundred and thirty five megahertz from
the fifteen hundred and forty five
megahertz for the official spec of
course GPU boost 4.0 can take advantage
of the massive cooler to boost clock
speeds even higher stock it maintained
1.8 gigahertz and all of the games that
we tested whereas the founders edition
model around three percent lower at 17
hundred and fifty-five megahertz so when
compared to the FE model don't expect
any noticeable performance gains from
this gigabyte model and where it should
offer improvements is in the operating
volume and temperatures and of course as
we've just seen it's a much more
impressive showpiece first thing I
wanted to do before messing around with
the settings in gigabyte soros engine
will see how hot it ran in its stock
out-of-the-box configuration so to do
that I fired up f1 2018 and ran the
benchmark at 4k on a continuous loop
what I was keeping an eye on here was
the GPU temperature and with a 76 degree
reference temperature from the found
Edition model and 72 degrees from the
massive MSI gaming extra oh I was
expecting something in that range and
well that's what I got the Auris extreme
peaked at 75 degrees which isn't a huge
improvement over the FE model it's
obviously only a degree improvement and
it's a little bit disappointing
particularly given that the fans were
spinning at 2,000 rpm in comparison the
MSI model achieved a three degree lower
peak temperature with its fans spinning
at just 1,400 rpm and it was also
noticeably quieter meanwhile we see at
the Auris extreme was comparable to the
FE model in terms of temperature and
operating volume which isn't bad though
I was hoping it would be better the next
step was to do a little tinkering and
see just how fast we can make the Auris
extreme after much trial and error the
core accepted a value of plus 140 in the
GDD r6 memory plus 700 this resulted in
a peak or frequency of 2,000 megahertz
when gaming and an average frequency
after an hour-long stress test of
nineteen hundred and eighty megahertz so
not quite as good as the MSI model and
very similar to what we saw with the FE
model also for this overclock I did set
the fan speed at 100%
which spanned them up to 2800 rpm and
here they were quite loud
that said the GPU p2 just 70 degrees
though we did have a reasonably low
ambient air temperature of just 22
degrees throwing on some k-type
thermocouple zorad us to measure the
surface temperature of the power stages
and GDD a sixth memory as well as some
PCB temperatures and I'll throw those up
on screen now using our overclock with
the maximum fan setting the verum hit
just 55 degrees with the memory hitting
62 degrees
I should note though that is a 5 degree
increase for both the memory and vrm
over the MSI model ok time for a few
quick benchmarks and since all our TX 20
IDT our graphics cards will provide a
very similar level of performance we're
not going to waste time going over loads
and loads of gaming benchmarks since all
the graphs are pretty much going to show
us well pretty much the same thing for
testing our standard core i7 87k GPU
test rig was used the CPU was clocked at
5 gigahertz and we have 16 gigabytes of
ddr4 3400 memory here we see when
testing was shut over the tomb raider
that the Auris extreme 2082 I match the
MSI damming extra out of the box making
it a few frames faster than the FE model
as I mentioned earlier once overclocked
to the MSI model dude holds slightly
higher clock speeds and this allowed to
provide an extra frame in this test so
yeah as I said performance testing won't
reveal anything we haven't really seen
before we find a very similar story when
testing with strange Brigade though this
time the Auris extreme was slightly
slower than the MSI gaming it's true out
of the box and that margin was
maintained once overclocked wrapping up
the FPS testing we are Far Cry 5 and the
margins here are basically identical to
those seen previously the MSI gaming
extra and it's bigger cooler enjoyed a
very slight performance advantage though
I doubt you'll notice the 1 to 2 extra
frames when it came to power consumption
the Auris extreme was again comparable
to the MSI gaming extreme model as well
as in videos found edition so in terms
of framerate performance it was pretty
much as expected not a lot to get
excited over and well I pretty much knew
that would be the case going into it
this model really is all about those
flashy RGB fans but yeah most r-tx 20
idgi graphics cards will provide a very
similar level of performance especially
out of the box and having said that
though they
probably will all provide the same very
limited overclocking head room where the
Auris extreme really stands out from the
pack is in the RGB lighting department
nothing I've seen so far comes even
close to providing the wow factor of
this gigabyte model as I said earlier if
you begin to RGB lighting and you want a
shelf you build them this really is a
must-have item the range of available
effects is very impressive and I found
that the RGB fusion software worked
flawlessly honestly there really isn't
much to dislike here and although I
suspect the price is going to be pretty
horrendous that's par for the course
with these r-tx 20 atti models cooling
performance while certainly not bad
was a little lackluster as the Auris
extreme I was bested by MSI bigger and
heavier gaming X trio and it really
wasn't much better than nvidias
foundation model which yet again it's
quite disappointing but not exactly a
bad result the back plate does tend to
get very hot and if gigabyte could find
an effective means of cooling it for
future models that would really help
here though unfortunately space is
really limited on the back side of the
card if you want to maintain maximum
compatibility I should just note though
of cooling is your primary concern then
gigabytes or as extreme water for series
I might be more what you're after and
perhaps we'll review one of those models
in the future and then of course as
we've shown in this video
MSI's gaming extra card is also very
good I did very much like gigabytes GTX
TDI water force extreme edition graphics
card and I still actually have that in
use today it's going strong no issues
with the pump so yeah keen to check out
the RT X xx atti models overall the
gigabyte horas RT X xx atti extreme is a
very solid offering the visuals are very
much on point they look absolutely
fantastic as you've seen the build
quality seems very reasonable very good
pretty much everything you'd expect from
a premium high-end graphics card I know
these things are mighty expensive but
yeah it's as good as any card that I've
seen so far so yeah all-round very solid
offering and I have absolutely no
problem recommending this beast if
you're after a very flashy looking RT X
xx atti graphics card to set off your
build I'm actually
a little bit disappointed it wasn't
around when I put this thing together
because I reckon having that there with
it flashy lights maybe a bit distracting
for that the set PC but still would be
very impressive all the same anyway that
