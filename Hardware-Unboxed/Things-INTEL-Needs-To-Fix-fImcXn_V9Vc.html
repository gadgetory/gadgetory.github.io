video is an opinion piece and I guess
it's a bit of a wish list from a
consumers perspective things we would
like to see until do better with that
would benefit all of us as the current
market leader and longtime dominant
force in the CPU space Intel's been out
to get away with a lot and really this
is because the competition has allowed
them to some will rally behind AMD
holding them up and saying how brilliant
they are increasing core counts with
rise and and finally sending us forward
after years and years of nothing but
quad cores on the mainstream don't get
us wrong what AMD is done with Verizon
really is impressive and we've said so
many times on the channel but they're
also a big part of why the past manner
almost decade has been very slow on the
cpu front but now that things are
getting seriously competitive we feel
Intel needs to change some stuff and
stuff that we've been asking the change
for years now last week Tim and myself
are over in Taiwan attending the
Computex trade show and we found
ourselves discussing a few areas where
Intel as well as AMD and NVIDIA need to
improve to become more consumer friendly
and at the end of that discussion we
thought it would actually make for a
pretty good video so here we are for
this first video I'm going to discuss
the Intel side of things I'll talk about
each point that was raised and please
note that none of these are in any
particular order they're just things
that we thought were worth talking about
and some of them will be more important
than others again we're looking at this
from your perspective the perspective of
a buyer so let's get into it
first order of business is the Tim no
not that one I'm sure many of you aware
of this but Intel no longer sold as
their desktop CPUs and this in my
opinion has been a big issue for years
now I've heard all the arguments for why
Intel no longer sold as their chips and
honestly I just don't buy them the best
case put forth is that solder can form
micro cracks after a certain amount of
thermal cycles over an undetermined
period of time a thermal paste on the
other hand is claimed to last a lot
longer especially for small dice CPUs
what we do know for a fact is that
Intel's desktop CPUs ran much cooler
back when they were soldered in 2011 the
Sandy Bridge days for the mainstream
desktop CPUs while the higher-end parts
they were soldered up to the Broadwell
era in 2016 as a quick little example
the core i7 3770k running at 4.7
gigahertz using 1.35 volt would peak at
just over 90 degrees running at a 260
for stress tests using a large tower
style air cooler and then under the
exact same conditions but with 1.4 volt
so more voltage the 2600 K ran at least
20 degrees cooler and we've seen that
time and time again even with the much
newer Intel CPUs that deal adding them
drops temperatures by at least 20
degrees I've also got quite a few Sandy
Bridge CPUs that have been overclocked
all their life and had been used on a
regular basis over the past seven years
and the thermal performance as far as I
can tell is exactly the same as the day
I first tested them back in 2011 if any
of you who are still using a Sandy
Bridge processor or an older one and
have seen an increase in thermals I
would love to hear about it because I
haven't actually heard any reports that
they have seen thermals go through the
roof or even increase a little bit so
yeah if you've seen that please do let
us know in the comment section below
that would be very interesting to hear
so although I don't have any real
concrete evidence other than the CPUs
that I've had for many years now I
I'm gonna call BS on the micro cracks
being a serious concern at least for the
most part I don't doubt that it does
happen I just don't think it's a serious
concern I don't think it's a legitimate
reason for not soldering CPUs I still
believe the real reason Intel doesn't
solve their chips is because it's an
expensive process so this is just a
saving exercise pretty plain and simple
intel is a big business and this is just
a classic big business decision all the
evidence does suggest that soldiering is
clearly a better method in terms of
performance and this is why Intel still
solder there's the on server chips
I'd say it's easier to get away with
shafting the general consumer and with
no competition they can probably get
away with doing the same to enthusiasts
at least they have been anyway I get
that per overclockers are happy to deal
Eid and they can even profit from the
process by providing tools for
enthusiasts to do the same I'm not
saying there's anything wrong there or
dodgy I'm just merely pointing it out
but for most I think it just results in
hotter processors that are more costly
and difficult to cool so I am Pro solder
while on the subject of cooling the box
cooler that thing could do with a
serious upgrade the 73 watt model
supplied with the core i7 8700 is a
complete joke and we don't really want
to see any more of that we definitely
don't want to see any more of that again
like the thermal paste this is merely a
cost-saving exercise we've already seen
how the Intel Box cooler provided with
the 8700 can't avoid extreme thermal
throttling under load even with a well
ventilated case with an ambient air
temperature of just 21 degrees so this
is pretty straightforward and I think
everyone can agree Intel needs to
seriously up their box cooler game sadly
the Hoover Intel they have missed a
golden opportunity to release their next
generation with their box cooler called
the Wraith Ripper they can thank
Coolermaster for that one so in summary
we want bigger coolers that not just
eliminate thermal throttling but reduced
thermals to acceptable levels and
soldering would play a key role here as
well oh and of course we do want coolers
that don't sound like a jet about to
take off that would be very welcomed
all right so this one is pretty
straightforward as I said earlier these
requests aren't in any kind of order or
listed by any kind of importance but
what I want here is for Intel to start
sending reviewers retail products in
retail packages AMD sends retail
versions of their CPUs to reviewers and
sure they do test them before shipping
but I don't have too much of an issue
with that one step one would be at least
sending retail products to those that
are reviewing them and testing them for
potential buyers Intel sends reviewers
qsr or qualification sample chips and
although these are technically identical
to the OEM or retail CPUs and still much
rather show the full-blown retail chip
on launch day with all the details on
packaging and possibly even more
importantly the retail cooler should the
cpu actually come with one for those of
you wondering the qsr chips come from
just an early production run and they're
generally sent out to OEMs and board
partners to validate their hardware so
anyone that got their hands on the core
i7 8,700 or the core i5 8400 ahead of
release from someone like a board
partner for example that's how we got
our 8400 they would have needed to
source a standard into a box cooler if
they wanted to test out-of-the-box
performance getting Intel box cool isn't
that difficult because they've been
shipping the same cooler now with their
retail CPUs for a long time but you
would have to assume that Intel was
sticking with the seventh gen box color
for the new 8th gen parts because that
information wasn't really given out we
didn't know what the Box cooler would be
because we weren't told and we didn't
have any retail chips
okay so again remember I'm complaining
on behalf of the consumer not someone
who gets product sent to them for review
so someone that actually goes and buys
them that being the case we obviously
want to pay as little as possible while
still getting what we want and Intel
wants to charge us as much as possible
while giving us I suppose as little as
possible and with limited competition
prior to last year it really has been
advantage Intel recently those things
have changed and in a bigger way but
while the competition continues to step
up Intel really hasn't stepped down on
pricing we're getting a little bit more
than what we were a few years ago but
really that should be the natural
progression of things anyway admittedly
pricing for the mainstream coffee like
desktop parts isn't too bad Intel is
still robbing us in a few areas like the
Box cooler and other things that I've
talked about but it's really their
high-end desktop parts that are grossly
overpriced at least in my opinion and
this is largely because Intel wants to
avoid cannibalizing their server parts
where they do make the big bucks for
example even though Skylar cakes doesn't
offer ECC memory support Intel still
doesn't want to risk hurting sales of
the Xeon series at the workstation
equivalent of the core I 979 ATX Eve and
that costs a further five hundred and
fifty dollars us for example but with
AMD's recent thread repre noun sment
Intel will surely be finally forced to
become more competitive on pricing and
Intel users won't be forced to pay a
hideous premium for the same kind of
performance that aimed it typically
offers for much less of course you will
also have to stop overpaying for your
CPUs if you want Intel to stop
overcharging
something we are starting to see more
and more of is Intel abusing the TDP it
got particularly bad with the coffee
lake series and I do have to give credit
to gia matador TV for first picking up
on this it wasn't the case with the 8400
but it was indeed the case for the 8700
so we are going to give credit there and
Intel has been only get away with
abusing the TDP because of what it means
it seems based on the comments that we
often read that most people don't
realize that the TDP actually refers to
the power dissipation when the processor
is running at the base clocks the TDP
tells us nothing about how the CPU runs
at its boost clocks and what sort of
cooling is required to run at higher
than base frequencies in recent years
Intel has been pushing the boundaries of
the TDP by continuing to shuffle the
base clocks lower and lower while
keeping the boost clocks as high as
possible this allows them to release a
CPU that falls under a certain TDP while
still bragging about high clock speeds
take the core i7 8700 as an example this
CPU comes with a 65 watt TDP which
correlates to its 3.2 gigahertz base
clock however the chip has a 4.6
gigahertz single core boost frequency it
can boost a whole 1.4 gigahertz higher
than its base and in the process blows
the power consumption well up of 65
watts in fact we monitored it hitting
128 watts in a short stress test in
typical workloads where you want to and
are running well above the base clocks
the TDP rating of the chip is completely
meaningless the problem with this is
that some OEMs and even in tell
themselves packaged CPUs like the core
i7 8700 with coolers that are barely
capable of dissipating the power
specified by the TDP some pre-built even
lock the CPUs power draw to the TDP to
prevent their terrible cooler from being
overwhelmed then when a user wants to
hit the boost clocks that they've seen
on Intel's website they are unable to do
so because the system and the cooler
have been designed around the TDP in the
modern landscape where CPUs boost more
than a gigahertz higher than their base
clock and are capable of sustaining that
frequency for long periods Intel should
be using a TDP or similar metric that is
an actual reflection of the typical
power consumed during those
high-performance workloads buyers would
then have a much better idea
the cooler they need and Intel would be
forced to upgrade their crappy box cool
that is something more capable of
running the CPU at its full boost clocks
we'd end up with better om systems
everyone would be better informed about
power consumption and would all live
happily ever after
okay I've got a bit carried away with
how great and accurate TDP rating would
make everything but still it would be
nice
okay so the core i3 8350 k is a great
idea and all but at $180 us there is
more wrong here than just the cpu price
I talked about box coolers earlier and
how crap they are well in this case with
the 8350 k and other unlocked case.you
models there's no cooler at all then
making matters even worse is the fact
that you require a Z series chipset to
enable overclocking in this case AZ 370
motherboard granted zeb 370 boards
aren't too crazy in terms of pricing and
it is possible to snag one for a little
over $100 u.s. though for that price you
are getting an extremely basic
motherboard what would make far more
sense is a $65 USB 360 board that can
support CPU overclocking and hey why not
throw in some memory overclocking
support while you're at it personally I
am well and truly over this locked
chipset nonsense give enthusiasts on a
budget the chance to get the most out of
their CPU intel's really no longer in a
position to get away with this so you
guys need to let them know about it
again we realized that AMD is the
underdog here and they need to be as
competitive as they possibly can be in
all these areas so I'm not saying
they're Saints but the fact that you can
overclock any rise and CPU on a be 350
motherboard and affordabl be 350
motherboard at that is really awesome
and if Intel want to limit their losses
they'll do the same
also while on the topic of overclocking
we don't just want to see overclocking
support extended to more affordable
chipsets but also more affordable CPUs
you know like old days apart from being
unlocked and more expensive there really
isn't anything or there really is a
single thing special about the K Series
models they're just more expensive and
unlocked and they still feature the same
crappy thermal interface material that
we discussed earlier I think it was the
first point we touched on and unlike the
unlike the locked models they don't come
with a cooler at all even a crappy
cooler so as a customer I want to see
intel drop the k models and just the
unlocked parts altogether just get rid
of them and make every cpu unlocked and
that would just that for me that would
make Intel CPUs truly exciting yet would
make overclocking exciting again and I
really feel like this is a win-win
situation for Intel perhaps I'm looking
at this wrong perhaps I'm naive but I
honestly think this would make Intel
CPUs just so much more exciting I also
really can't see this cannibalizing that
other cpu lines that much well maybe a
little bit but not not significantly and
I think the gains would outweigh any
disadvantages there based on some recent
polls that we've done on the channel it
seems like your average gamer doesn't
really like to overclock anyway so it's
yeah it's our opinion this approach
would certainly get more
budget-conscious
enthusiasts talking about Intel CPUs and
that's something that I think we'll
start to see less and less of over the
next few if things continue the way they
are
okay so this is a big one compatibility
Intel really need to stop shifting us
when it comes to compatibility and
really only limits support when
absolutely necessary the current and
previous few generations all use the
same physically identical LGA 1151
socket so why can't you use an 8th gen
core process on a 100 or 200 series
motherboard and why I can't use a 6 or
seventh gen processor on a 300 series
motherboard
there's no reason no reason at all
apparently last year Intel lied about
the reason why compatibility was dumped
claiming that the two additional cause
of the new core i5 and i7 models require
more power and while that is technically
true these new processors don't use that
much more power and at least to my
knowledge there isn't a single Xen 170
or 0 to 70 board that they wouldn't work
on until also noted that these EDD 370
motherboards have improved memory
routing to support ddr4 2666 a slight
increase over cable HDD r4 2400 because
said 170 and Xen 270 boards haven't been
proven to handle ddr4 4000 without any
issues 2666
is really going to trip them up you
might think I'm being a bit harsh here
and well I have called Intel Liars
without providing any evidence so let's
just get to that quickly back in October
of 2017 Andrew were the seuss ROG
product manager went on the record in a
bit Tech interview and clearly said
there is no reason why coffee like CPUs
can't work on 100 and 200 series
motherboards he said that it was an
Intel decision to remove compatibility
the power consumption increase was small
and he also said but it makes no real
difference so the main takeaway here
being that backwards compatibility isn't
a problem but Intel would need to allow
it it's certainly plausible that
overclocking Headroom is greater on the
more optimized at 370 boards but there's
just no reason why the 8th gen CPUs
can't work on older motherboards and why
those older CPUs certainly can't work on
the newer motherboards and more recently
modders deal indeed managed to get
coffee like CPU is working on 100 and
200 series boards without any problems
I also haven't heard a single reason why
the sixth
seventh gen CPUs couldn't work on a 300
series board that is assuming that Intel
opened up support as an example if
you're 100 or 200 series motherboard
died in a year from now chances are you
would be able to get a new 300 series
board cheaper than that of a secondhand
board using an older chipset so there's
more than half a dozen things we as
consumers feel Intel needs to address of
course this is merely a wish list if you
will and we don't expect that Intel will
address any of these concerns but if
they did that would be pretty amazing
and yeah it'd be great to see them
tackle a few of these over the next year
with continuing pressure from AMD we'd
be surprised if Intel doesn't get
serious about a few of these points but
so far they've been fairly stubborn on
the idea of change that said we are
starting to see some serious kinks in
Intel's armor as they rush products out
run into security problems and fake
press demos anyway I hope you enjoyed
this video and if you did hang tight
because next week we'll tackle what AMD
needs to fix followed by what Nvidia
needs to fix so let us know in the
comments section below if there's
anything you think we missed in this
video and if you have any suggestions
for the upcoming AMD and NVIDIA versions
as always thank you for watching I'm
your host Steve and I'll see you next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
