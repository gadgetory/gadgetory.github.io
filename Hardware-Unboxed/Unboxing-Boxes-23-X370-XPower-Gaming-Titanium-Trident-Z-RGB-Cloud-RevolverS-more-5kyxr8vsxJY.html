unboxed today we have another episode of
unboxing boxes and helping me out or
helping to unbox all these boxes will be
Tim who you should have just met in a
video earlier if you haven't I'll put a
link in the description you can watch
that where we explain who Tim is and
what is here to do anyway we'll start
with this box here I reckon if I can
work out
got it all right all right what have we
got here I've got a little something or
other weapons crate
don't mind me all right so it looks like
we've got the creative soundblaster
weapons crate any idea what that is so
we got two tabs there slide and it opens
up like that one looks at it oh wow nice
that's pretty impressive
so we got a mouse keyboard not sure what
that is it looks like a mouse pad so um
sorry take this out never look so we've
got a cloth pad you want to grab out the
keyboard and have a look out for us
oh yeah take a look it's quite a nice
design to be honest nice and stealthy
but I bet it's got some lighting in
there some kind yeah I'd say so
jimmy'll I wonder what Keys I will look
at the key cap something oh this is um
said Omron oh yeah I believe that's who
makes these so it's not cherry
anyway they um yeah mechanical right
they mechanically out I don't see
there's like a USB port that's hidden
it's got a pass-through
yeah just under there as well that looks
pretty cool actually some fake rubber
pads but yeah a good-looking quality
keyboard from creative there and you've
got a nice media controls yeah a lot of
people i think it was i was watching
Jays two cents and he said he doesn't
know why they include those because no
one uses them but I actually use these
them all the time to know what it's not
about yeah so let us know in the
comments guys do you actually use the
dedicated multimedia keys or they just
something that are there that you just
ignore completely video I love the wheel
as well the volume especially when
you're sort of sitting back watching
something you just were so easy yeah I
like using that and I've got macro keys
on here as well
yeah so that's cool you got five macro
keys I'm not sure if what we're doing
dedicate review on this stuff from
creative if we are might be something
Tim we'll take care of it we'll see what
happens and it looks like oh there's a
mouse as well yeah it's got a mouse I'm
not know much about that either the m04
or mo4 yeah I think it's I think it's a
0-0 mo 4 sounds better than em yeah
looks pretty good though it's quite nice
it's got three buttons on this side and
guess there's a button there actually
you can plug it into the yeah dude
hopefully it turns and it might need to
might have to have the drivers installed
in Windows for it to light up well well
I guess it doesn't work send us another
one creative try plug that one in and
see if it lights up the keyboard
otherwise it might have to have the
drive is installed first alright that
was a fail forget about that I know it
seems nice and economic at least for my
smallish lot of hands yeah we'll have to
throw up some beer old a better show
what weird what it looks like nice
texturing alright okay so the UM the
wrist rest unfortunately falls out very
easily using magnetic no that just falls
out so just but sitting on your desk
gonna work quite well with the second
you got to move it that's gonna happen
yeah it's a little bit annoying I like
when they actually hold on well because
if you're moving it back and forth
constantly yeah it's a lot less annoying
but anyway that's that's a pretty cool
little hit there I think k08 I was at
the keyboard is it yeah it's going on
this side cool there you go the k08 and
the was at the m m 0 for m 0 for yeah we
don't were talking about I believe this
is selling currently for 200 us and I
think creative suggests that all the
geeta buy separately would be closer to
300 us and Ozzy pricing isn't clear at
this stage it's not being sold down
under just yet but yeah you get this
neat little so I guess the point of this
is if you're a mad land party goer and
your takeaway system to land rather than
I suppose it'd be probably more can you
check this stuff in a bag but if you
want to keep it
in good Nick and it'll this will survive
some Falls no worries you can chuck this
in here put your PC hopefully you with a
little handle in your other hand
tuck your monitor under your arm and oh
yeah very cool kit so hopefully we get a
chance to review that now I mean yeah
you got the mousepad and then there's
some sort of little pad they're not sure
what then really honestly feels and
looks a lot like a tiny mousepad for
France all right I'll give you the knife
and you can get stuck into anything it
doesn't matter what it is we'll work it
out later
quad reckons in this small one yeah go
into that one
from Corsair alright looks like it's
probably Corsair this has the media kit
for the weapons crate so there'll be
some interesting information on that
cool Wow
would you that's very heavy a lot of
cables in there man yeah so premium PSU
cable kit so as I understand it this
obviously works with Corsair power
supplies they'll be probably a
compatibility list but it'll be most of
their modular power supply units oh yeah
they're sleeved cables so those guys
that want to do a really nice clean
install can upgrade the cables that come
I think they usually use individually
sort of rubber yeah black rubber ones so
these look look will have a bit of a
look inside and yeah is this open does
that just tear off I have to be doing
this oh no I'm doing alright yep I just
tore it there we go easy and I thought
that was the hardest stock it's taped at
the bottom
I'm butchering this box I'm a
professional unboxer okay wow these look
very cool so they're actually a hardware
unboxed blue it's a light blue color
with black so they're 50% blue 50% black
and I have a PCIe 6 pin / 8 pin cable
here there's a lot of them yeah what was
a very heavy biography I once got some
molex and solder ones in here there's a
nice bag as well it's a $50 u.s. which I
suppose there's a lot of money for fancy
cables but sleeved cables are generally
quite pricey but it looks like at the
moment it's selling for a hundred and
twenty Ozzie which it's pretty expensive
yeah I mean they are really nice it's um
it's got the resistors you it you
probably know more about why they're
there than I would being electrical
engineer wouldn't you about resistors in
the cables isn't that isn't that a
cleans up the power delivery of the
graphics card probably so I'm not an
expert on it but I've never seen that
before I know the hiring I don't know if
all of them yeah therefore the they've
got over here on the motherboard cable
as well okay there's a capacitor in
there as well in there it will just be
modifying like the properties of the
cable to give a better cleaner power
delivery which will yeah improve your
efficiency I guess at least that's the
aim I think yeah so anyway we'll
probably have to do a bit of research on
that a bit more but anyway we have very
nice cables indeed I'll have to I'll
upgrade the KB Lake system that Corsair
sponsored with these cables at some
point you'll see me installing these and
they should look pretty cool but yeah
expensive in Australia not too bad in
the states in the US be 120 bucks you'd
have to be pretty keen on your system
build for that we'll have a look at this
FedEx one next if I can open it that's
definitely nothing those are some tough
bag now yeah
this is from actually I won't say we'll
find out what's in a this bubble wrap I
can get to it
oh wait very very cool so we have the
Tritons er GB memory I've been trying to
get my hands on this for months and I'm
glad to finally have it how many sticks
are in here it looks like it's just true
modules no it's only got our two on the
that's pretty cool
I'll chuck some b-roll up of these in
action and standard looking when they're
not turned on Triton Z memory try the Z
but uh yeah black on one side grayish
silverish sort of color on the other and
then you've got the clear strip at the
top which has I think it's I'm just
guessing something like 16 LEDs embedded
in there doesn't say on the box I'll
have to find it out but just showing
them here they don't look I mean they
look cool but not as impressive as they
will lead up so I'll Chuck some b-roll
as I'm talking right now over our faces
as how they look all four modules there
are about a hundred and forty us
starting so that would probably be a
dual module kit I'd say and then it'll
be $200 Ozzy starting price for what
would probably be a dual module kit as
well I don't know
there must be 16 gigs these days for
about that price would be the yeah I
think so because there's a 200 so these
are a gigabyte stick so yeah probably
for two of these you're looking about
200 Ozzy so I know memory prices have
gone up recently so that does sound
pricey but I think that's kind of normal
issue for current market prices anyway
cool memory and hopefully the b-roll
that you guys will have already seen by
now looked cool because we don't know
how they look at this point I'm sure
they were of course I'm sure they look
awesome
I'll let you tackle whatever is in there
not as much of a professional as you oh
wow
I struggled on that last box and you'd
already unbox that you don't have to
jump for me
it's an empty looking box okay yeah so
this is what we were talking about in
the video you previously
yeah I've been expecting me to get the
Kingston HyperX cloud revolver s I think
this is their new sort of top of the
line
yeah gaming headsets obviously it does
this it says on the back there does 7.1
Dolby surround sound I says on the front
as well it's got the microphones got USB
it's got a nice steel frame and
everything so yeah look at it checking
these out cuz yeah nice to get a good
high in headset so yeah we looked at
that I think the cloud twos were
probably my favorite so down on the
bottom again got once again the cloud
twos were really good value amazing
quality and really durable great headset
and I think a lot of guys probably you
guys watching use them and hear they're
very good the revolvers were quite good
as well I think a few people will let
down they're coming from the cloud to
the original revolver so I'll be
interesting to see what the role of over
revolver yes I was hoping I still had
the revolver the original revolvers like
you guys would probably remember the the
fury these sorry the the HyperX revolver
still got that kicking around little jag
really nice sort of matte soft touch
finish to the plastic on these parts as
well as the metal around there a bear
they look real nice this is the inline
controller from using it for those two
seconds I can say they're very
comfortable how is the sound quality ah
yeah I have to test that one later but
now they're definitely yeah you're real
reviews gonna be more in-depth yeah but
ah they're very very comfortable yeah
very lightweight and everything which is
nice from the sort of over your
headphone so I think over is sort of
what I prefer to use yeah at least
especially for long sessions yeah
definitely and you want something to be
really comfortable and I think there's a
microphone oh you've got the might
action so that must go in plug in
somewhere around there somewhere on the
bottom maybe it does not look obvious
they're a cover or something like that
you think it would go well bear with us
I've got because it needs to fit in this
little doesn't look like on the box
about - I'm have to refer to the manual
is that it there yeah that's it there
we've got it same size as a cable so
yeah there you go
yeah looks cool it's nice and flexible
good and you get this little control
module as well and that's USB only that
connection at the end of that so I'll
get another cable in here for ah yep so
I think you can use it either by just
the 3.5 million at Jack yep
or you can use this which I think does
that 7.1 Dolby surround sound just press
the button or something and that
probably does all the processing magic
for you so very nice it's a really nice
looking headset and and you do we know
the price of this one yet um yes I think
it's a hundred and fifty u.s. or should
convert to around two hundred Australian
but we're not quite sure on the pricing
so definitely premium yeah definitely
and probably you know more expensive
than other and you you will definitely
be reviewing those waiting on however
most definitely will be a full review
hardware box awesome awesome looking
forward to that does it say anything on
the inside of that box on the letter
I think the Rope yeah there you go is a
nice little message yeah it says
congratulations on joining the HyperX
team and then it probably tells us about
the features what an amazing decision
you will air very much as the experts in
comfort we offer our award-winning
signature memory foam 4 hours of
painless gaming and they were pretty
comfortable so I think that's probably a
fair assessment get away with that one
yeah alright one last box on the table
then we have another box after this to
look at but we'll get into this one
quickly I works with Xbox as well well
does it yeah
a lot of people actually ask that and we
didn't address that in the last review
because we're only really interested in
the PC stuff right yeah but I think it
definitely certain the inside of the box
suitable to the Xbox one okay very cool
very cool you guys are gonna love this
sorry what I have here are the final
pieces for that giveaway PC I've
probably only mentioned about ten times
now but I will be building that this
week and hopefully next week you guys
will see those videos and the details of
how to enter and everything so for that
system we have a RX 480 and this is a
really cool bit of kit here the X 370 X
power gaming titanium it's fancy box I
think it's a very fancy motherboard in
this fancy box actually we might get a
peek of it here
oh heavily of that I'll get some b-roll
this for you guys I've actually got to
handle this with care because it's not
just one of my usual review samples that
I can rough handle yeah this will be
going to one of the harbour unbox
subscribers for there the whole computer
they'll be winning you can take that of
all and have a look if you want Wow nice
finish yeah
that is probably one of the coolest
looking motherboards I've ever seen that
is very impressive I'll throw you some
b-roll off of this so you guys can check
it out but we're the back of it I don't
think I've ever been so impressed with
the back side so show you won't actually
see that once it's installed it's more
handling with care needs to yeah I'm
scared to handle this like out normally
I'd just be throwing this around and
showing you guys but similar to their
previous yeah most of their yeah use the
stuff over see the gaming X design red
and black for AMD look a nice yeah well
it'll be a red and black build we've got
the red USB ports to stuff on that oh
yeah so this will be well I guess if yet
we'll probably think we've got some RGB
lighting strips from Thermaltake that'll
be going in the build and I think
that'll reflect the light off very well
that could look pretty amazing actually
yes I'm very keen to try that out so
yeah they're the the last pieces of the
puzzle will be an AMD Verizon 7 1800 X
CPU there'll be some kingston memory
kingston SSD and the rest will be film
will take bits really keen actually you
might have to go home i'm going to start
building that you can stay a bit longer
so the guys are just getting to meet
yeah but yeah so that's cool so oh we've
got one more thing don't like what's
that's right actually I'll put the
motherboard back in your Mart about
damaging that
savior's yeah as well yep I'll get on
the box right so obvious is big so it
must be a monitor
it certainly is it is the asus rog swift
PG 2 v 8 q so this is a 24-inch monitor
1080p but the key feature is of course
240 Hertz so it should be mighty mighty
fast we're not quite sure what games you
can actually play yeah 240 Hertz at
least compared to 144 Hertz it does do G
sync as well so for those of you that
have Nvidia systems perfectly suited to
that one millisecond it's got features
on this side but yeah one millisecond
times all that sort of stuff and yeah
really excited to check that one out
yeah I think for the casual gamers it'll
be a nice monitor but it'll probably be
more targeting specially that 240 Hertz
refresh so I imagine guys that are
really into overwatch csgo all that kind
of stuff it'll be pretty cool in the
review actually to see what it takes to
drive you know those kind of in those
games that I think we've anything too
extreme you could probably do it quite
comfortably on something like a GTX 1080
but yeah you wouldn't need two of them
or anything like that nice yeah well I
think you'll want a high in system for
this because this does cost a fair bit
of money as well like you out with some
good Hardware if currently retailing for
I think 600 u.s. and $900 II dues for us
so it's certainly yeah operator monitor
pricing but for what is it 24 and a half
inch this yeah 24 by guess you got to
pay for g-sync in 240 Hertz yeah it's a
lot of money for a what's considered to
be a relatively small monitor in the
days of your 30 plus inch wide
you know ultra wide but still after
quality's there we'll find out in your
review I suppose yeah hopefully be
coming soon that's that's a really cool
thing about having Tim on the channel
now because monitors just aren't
something I'd be touching on on the
channel and I like I said I get tons of
requests constantly Steve review some
monitors tell us about monitors and yeah
it's not really in my wheelhouse
monitors that much which sounds a bit
weird but yeah I generally just buy one
really good monitor and that hasn't
set I don't yeah dabble with monitors
too much but Tim has the expertise and
experience to give in-depth monitor
reviews they'll be just the start of
many oh sorry yeah yeah well we'll see
how well received is but hopefully you
guys all watch it enjoy it and yeah be
good so I think that pretty much wraps
up everything or unwraps everything that
we have to unbox we saw the weapons
create the creative weapons correct
that's pretty cool hopefully there will
be a review on that at least we've shown
it for now anyway the G skill memory
which you will have seen the b-roll I'm
sure it was cool
and that will pre featured in a build
soon I'd say and then we've got the last
bits for the giveaway which is going to
be awesome that rise and 7 giveaway that
is just going to be phenomenal so I
can't wait to get stuck into that on
Monday once I finish testing Mass Effect
Andromeda that'll suck off B at a time
and of course their cabling do blue and
black sleeved cables yeah it's quite
nice of course got the rog swift monitor
and the headsets the HyperX cloud
revolver s so a lot of stuff that we've
unboxed I think yeah if that was if it
was just me doing this episode by myself
with this many items since it easily be
an hour-long episode I would have
rattled on about things guys don't care
about track forever in a day but now
I've don't know how long this episode or
leave it I think we got through it
quicker than normal but anyway that's
all for this one anything else you want
to say just know think just you know
look out for some of the reviews that
will go be doing over the next couple of
weeks yeah
well I'm excited to watch your room it's
great to get on the channel you know
after a couple of weeks of organizing
this and everything it's great good
really cool alright guys thanks for
watching and we'll catch you again soon
