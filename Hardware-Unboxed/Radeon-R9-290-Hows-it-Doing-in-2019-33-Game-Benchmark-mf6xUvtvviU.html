taking a good look at the Radeon r9 290
and this is actually my first AIB review
sample of the Radeon r9 290 it was sent
in by gigabyte it's the OSI model and as
you can see it still working today it
served me very well so yeah very nice
graphics card that it was once quite a
powerful graphics card back in 2013 it
was selling for around $400 u.s. and
yeah even at that price it was
considered to be a real steal as it was
coming up against much more expensive
parts were Nvidia and this was
delivering similar levels of performance
it was later refreshed I think in 2015
with twice as much RAM as the r9 390 and
the MSRP was dropped to thrown or $30.00
u.s. so that sounds pretty good but
timing wise it wasn't great because the
290s was selling for less than that and
the extra vram wasn't particularly
useful the time so it was kind of an
unwelcomed product though the three 90s
did prove to be rather worthwhile I
suppose down the track anyway that was
the second generation GC and
architectures last outing and by late
2016 it was no more at least as far as
the brand new market was concerned there
are still plenty of these six year old
GPUs kicking around as they are still
quite capable after all it is a 250 watt
part packing two thousand five hundred
and sixty cause and the gigabyte OSI
model that we have on hand comes clocked
at 1040 megahertz the r9 290 also packs
a very wide 512 bit memory bus along
with five gigabits per second gddr5
memory and this allows for a peak
bandwidth of 320 gigabytes per second
roughly the same bandwidth as the r-tx
2060 for example so it should still be
able to tackle the latest games with
relative ease and that's what we look at
today for this one I'll be looking
closely at performance at 1080p in about
a dozen titles and then we'll jump to a
33 game breakdown comparing the r9 290
and rx 570 head-to-head the test system
used includes the core I 999 hurricane
clocked at 5 gigahertz with 32 gigabytes
of ddr4 3,200 memory as for the drivers
we used a
in 2019 edition nineteen point two point
three for the radeon gpus and game ready
for 1935 wh twelfth the GeForce GPUs
okay time for some benchmark results
first up we have apex legends and for
gaming at 1080p the Radeon r9 290 still
has what it takes
delivering over 60 FPS on average with a
one percenter low of 53 fps so very
playable performance this place the r9
290 on par with the GTX 1063 gigabyte
and just behind the radiant rx 570 again
very respectable performance from the
now six year old GPU moving on to the
division 2 and here the r9 - honey was
again able to deliver playable
performance and while it did fall short
of 60fps with the ultra quality preset
it was still able to match the rx 570
and GTX 1060 so really not a bad result
at all frame rates and shut off the Tomb
Raider were quite impressive here the
old 290 beat the six gigabyte 1060 while
falling just shy of the Radeon rx 580
again it did just fall short of
averaging 60 FPS but even so the
resulting performance was still very
playable Forza horizon for does a good
job of leveraging the more recent
versions of AMD's GC and architecture
and we've seen that we're comparing the
fifth gen Vega parts to Pascal ensuring
that said the fourth gen rx 570 is
considerably better than the second gen
r9 290 providing 18% more frames on
average that's a pretty big performance
improvement for the RX 570 and it'll be
pretty interesting to see if there are
many or any other games to show these
kinds of improvements next up we have
hitman two and here they are known 290
RX 570 are basically delivering
identical performance the 290 did fall
short of 60 FPS on average but with the
same 51 FPS 1% lowers Eric's 570 the
experience was basically identical the
a9 290 did struggle a little in just
calls for with just 46 FPS on average
that said while it did fall just short
of the RX v 7t and three gigabyte 10 60
s average frame rate 1% low was actually
slightly stronger overall performance
was decent certainly playable but
ideally you will want to turn down the
visual settings for slightly better
frames we
we have Resident Evil 2 and here the r9
290 was very playable at 1080p using the
maximum in-game quality settings
averaging 72 fps this did place it a
little bit behind the RX 570 but it did
manage to match the gtx 1066 gigabyte as
you might have expected the r9 290 does
rather well in fortnight averaging 74
FPS with the epic quality settings
enabled this placed it on par with the
RX 517 while this did make it a good bit
slower than the RX 580 in gtx 1060 in
this title it really doesn't matter too
much for those playing at 1080p frame
rates in Metro Exodus weren't great it
has to be said and with just shy of 40
fps on average didn't match the rx 570
but like I said overall performance
wasn't great and you'll certainly want
to dial back the quality settings a
little the iodine 290 was ever so
slightly down on the RX 570 in Rainbow
six siege and while this MANET was able
to deliver playable performance for a
smoother experience you will want to
turn down some quality settings and
turning something down like the render
scale with TA enabled will solve the
issue pretty easily battlefield 5 was
also playable using the old r9 290 in
this time was roughly on path the RX 570
and that's something we've seen quite a
bit of now it seems as though for r9 290
owners you really need something like an
RT X 2060 or Vega 56 to be a worthwhile
upgrade now the second last game that
we're gonna look closely at is World of
Tanks and here the r9 290 average 74 FPS
to match the RX 570 exactly with over 60
FPS for the most part performance was
very smooth and for those playing at
1080p
I'd say the r9 290 still provides ample
frames and last up we have Far Cry nude
on here the r9 290 average 70 FPS
allowing it to match the GTX 1063 gear
button our x5 70 for this title 70 FPS
on average with a 1% load of 60 FPS is
perfect and for those who possess a 144
Hertz display will no doubt what more
those making do if six-year-old tech
will be very satisfied of course one of
the downsides to using old hardware is
power consumption and by today's
standards the Unown 290 isn't exactly
efficient or at least it isn't very
efficient
after all this is a 250 watt TDP GPU
delivering similar performance to an rx
570 a 150 watt TDP part this meant for
roughly the same performance total
system consumption increase by 32% with
the r9 290 so that's not great but a
decent 600 or 700 watt power supply will
have your covered okay so there you have
it the Radeon r9 290 in 2019 though so
far we have only looked at 13 of the 33
games that I tested did that despair you
having to go over the other 20 titles
that would have taken quite some time so
we're just going to jump to one of those
head-to-head comparison graphs and we'll
check one of those out in a moment
also please note for any of you wanting
to check out results for other games
pray warframe and well the other 18
games that we didn't look at you can do
so for free on our patreon page so the
link for that will be in the video
description anyway I think it's about
time we jumped over and had a look at
the 290 head-to-head with the RX 570
this is pretty much what we were
expecting to see based on the 13 game
sample we just looked at the Radeon r9
290 was just 2% slower on average when
compared to the rx 570 but we do see a
few games where it was slower by a 7%
margin or greater likewise we also see a
few examples where it was faster by a 7
percent margin or greater for me the
Wolfenstein results aren't that
surprising this volcán based title is
really good at utilizing many cores and
with the r9 290 packing 25% more cores
and 43% more bandwidth it's technically
the more powerful GPU when properly
utilized granted it doesn't clot quite
as high but when comparing AIB models
the clock speed deficit isn't that huge
still there are examples of modern games
that do take advantage of the more
up-to-date GCN architecture and we
certainly see this with titles such as
Falls on horizon 4 as well as a few
others but to a slightly lesser degree
so in short the Radeon r9 290 is very
similar to the rx 570 in terms of
performance though you don't want to
just assume they'll always deliver
comparable formats as the margin can be
as large as 20% that said if you're in
the market for a new graphics card and I
don't mean brand new just new to you and
you have her hand $100 to spend give or
take let's say $30 and what should you
buy
around $130 you can snag a brand new rx
570 meanwhile for around $80 us you can
get your grubby mitts on a secondhand r9
290 and that appears to be the average
selling price on eBay right now earlier
in the year when I made our mega used
graphics card guide I found the r9 290
to be one of the best value second-hand
deals coming out at a cost of 74 cents
per frame a secondhand rx 570 cost 87
cents per frame as they were typically
selling for $94 us today they're the
average selling price of an RX 570 eBay
is more like $60 and that makes it the
obvious choice for bargain hunters but
ignoring secondhand rx 570s for a moment
I still feel as they're a brand new rx
570 is a better deal than a secondhand
r9 290 for me saving $50 really isn't
worth it again these are six year old
graphics cards with no warranty and you
can safely assume most of them have had
a pretty tough life so unless you're
getting an r9 290 for I don't know I
reckon probably $40 or less then I'd
personally pass on it I know that really
isn't a lot it is a pretty awesome
graphics card for $40 but when you wipe
your options that sort of price for me
makes sense now let's reverse the
situation though what if you have an r 9
290 and you're looking to upgrade what
is the best solution available right now
I'd say it would have to either be the
gtx 1660 TI r TX 2060 or Vega 56 it
really just depends on pricing in your
region there is the occasional Vega 56
graphics card available at a killer
price but you have to be a bit lucky
with timing on those still if you can
get Vega 56 for 350 dollars then it's
certainly worth considering and under
$300 it really is a must
short of that though we have the r-tx
2060 at $250 and the gtx 1660 TI at 280
dollars if you bought the r9 290 knew
all those years ago then you would have
spent around $400 u.s. so assuming
you're willing to spend around that much
again something like the RT X 2060
really is a nice fit that said I'd be
very tempted to grab a gtx 1660 TI for
just $280 u.s. they offer a lot of
value at that price wrapping things up I
think it's fair to say that with a few
minor tweaks to the visual settings that
the Radeon r9 290 is still very usable
today and well that's good news for
those of you with older graphics cards
hoping to upgrade to one of these and
that said if you are you will have to
get it very cheap for it to make sense
so cheaper than the average selling
price on eBay
so keep that in mind also for those of
you using a 290 and wanting to upgrade
to something else there are quite a few
options available and they all cost less
than what you would have spent four to
six years ago on one of these so yeah
that's good news I suppose anyway I
think that's probably going to do it for
this one I hope you enjoyed the
benchmarks and remember you can jump
over to our patreon page for all 33
graphs if you want to take a closer look
at any of the games tested thank you for
watching I'm your host Steve and I'll
see you again next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
