for this video i will be once again
revisiting intel's wallet-friendly
pentium g 4560 processor and if you
missed it last week I did already check
this process around and I compared it
against the core i3 i5 and i7 processors
in well over a dozen games at 1080p and
1440p the key to that benchmark video
was the use of multiple different
graphics cards for testing each CPU I
did use the geforce gtx 1050 TI gtx 1060
and gtx 1080
this gave us a really good idea of how
these CPUs game when paired with
different tiered GPUs and the results
were very interesting the feedback I
received from that video was
overwhelmingly positive so big thank you
to everyone who offered support their
only negative or rather constructive
criticism that I received how to do with
the lack of AMD GPUs used for testing
and I get that the reason I went with
the 1050 TI 1016 tay is because they're
all current generation products that
cover a number of different performance
segments testing with say the rx 460 I
Explorer 18 fury X for example just
wouldn't provide the same range of
performance the fury X really is the
weakness here throwing in the RX 480 or
Arc's 470 along with the Nvidia based
GPUs would have made for far more
results and I can show on the screen
that's that I agree as the best sub $200
G for you testing our Explorer 70 really
is a must therefore I've gone back and
tested the RX 470 with the G 45 60 as
well as the core i3 i5 and i7 processors
the GTX 1080 has been dropped from the
results to make way for the RX 470 which
will be compared alongside the
previously tested gtx 1050 TI and 1064
now the g 45 60 looks to be by far the
best entry-level cpu available so
pairing it with what we believe to be
the best sub $200 GPU in the RX 470
should make for the ultimate gaming
combo that said many of you did express
concerns in regards to AMD's DirectX 11
driver overhead and feared this could be
an issue for the G 45
so let's find out right away we get off
to a bit of a rocky start with rise of
the Tomb Raider here the G 4560 really
struggle with the RX 470 installed
although the average frame rate looks
good the performance was very stuttering
and this is evident by that very low 22
FPS minimum this test was run half a
dozen times and every time the minimum
frame rate was very low bumping the
resolution up to 1440p didn't really
help out the G 4560 with the RX 470 and
again we see horribly low minimum frame
rates this is a really bad start but as
you're about to see it's far from the
norm and I'm still not clear why the
combo struggled so much and rise with
the Tomb Raider previously we found that
Far Cry primal wasn't at all CPU
intensive and this is again true when
using the rx 470 we saw the same 44 FPS
minimum and 55 FPS average across all
four CPUs tested before 1040 P results
were again much the same the G 45 60
does 4 1 FPS behind the other processes
with the rx 470 though that figure is of
course well within the margin of error
the division can be quite CPU intensive
at times but even so the RX 470 provides
similar performance to the GTX 1060 when
paired with the Pentium G 45 60 at 1080p
again we find much the same when looking
at the 1440p result here the G 45 60 was
able to max out the RX 470 the G 45 60
performs well and hitman when paired
with the RX 470 and here we see similar
margins to the GTX 1060 results the core
i5 and i7 processors do deliver better
performance at 1080p but with the G 45
60 averaging 60 fps and staying above 50
FPS the performance was very acceptable
a heavy GPU bottleneck can be seen at
1440p and here the G 45 60 is able to
match or at least roughly match the more
expensive processes when paired with
both the rx 470 and GTX 1060 graphics
cards the pentium g 45 60 wasn't quite
powerful enough to fully utilize the gtx
1060 in quantum break eternity v as it
fell down a 62 FPS at times that said
this processor was much more competitive
with the RX 470 in this title as the
minimum frame rate was just 5% lower
than that of the core i5 and core i7
processors oddly at 1440p the g 45 60
did fall away a bit more with the RX 470
in relation to the Core i5 and core
seven processes and here it was 10% slow
and comparing the minimum frame rate the
RX 470 looks to be the perfect pairing
for the G 45 60 and overwatch here the
budget combo never dipped below 100 FPS
while providing an average of 134 FPS
that made the G 45 60 just 9% slower
than the core i7 6700k for both the
minimum and average frame rates the
1440p results are a bit interesting
because all four CPUs were able to max
out the gtx 1060 the same wasn't true
for the swallow RX 4 70 that said the
margins weren't exactly significant in
the g 45 60 still remained very
competitive the g 45 60 performed very
well with the RX 470 and doom though we
do know this to be a primarily GPU
intensive title still the results at
1080p were impressive at was great to
see the G 45 60 /rx 470 combo pushing
over 130 FPS at all times interestingly
this is the second time we've seen the G
45 60 RX 470 combo follow a slightly
more at 1440p
again the margin wasn't significant but
this was still unexpected the total war
warhammer results are very interesting
indeed here we find that not only the G
45 60 but also the core i3 73 50k and
Core i5 7600 K performed better with the
RX 470 than they did with the gtx 1060
the g 45 60 gains were particularly
large with the minimum frame rate 25%
higher with the RX 4 70 moving to 1440p
provides mixed results here the G 45 60
still played best with the RX 4 70 to
spot a lower average frame rate that is
of course down to the fact that the
minimum frame rate was 40% higher
meanwhile the core i3 i5 and i7
processors deliver similar performance
with both GPUs the G 45 60 was fast
enough to max out the rx 470 and
Mirror's Edge catalyst at aap matching
the 54 FPS minimum and 64 FPS average of
the other processors tested as expected
we find the same as short 1440p here the
G 45 60 averaged 41 FPS with a 36 FPS
minimum allowing it to match the other
CPUs tested interestingly the G 45 60
again played better with the rx 470 than
it did with the gtx 1060 this time in f1
2016 the minimum frame rate was a
whopping 19 percent greater while the
average was also
eighteen percent greater these are very
surprising results but it's great news
for the G 4560 and the RX 470 combo
increasing the resolution or 1440p we
find similar results between the RX 470
and gtx 1060 when paired with the g4 560
overall Intel's new budget dual core
performed very well here the Deus Ex
mankind divided margins are similar when
using the G 4560 with e to the RX 470 or
gtx 1060 of course we are using a
low-level api here so these results are
pretty much what we were expecting to
find moving a 1440p the RX 470 is
completely maxed out using the very high
quality settings and this meant the G
4560 match the other three processors
tested the G 45 60 was 7% slower than
the core i3 processor when paired with
the geforce gtx 1060 in battlefield 1
the margin was extended as 12% with the
RX 470 and the dual core Pentium
processor dropped 253 FPS bumping the
resolution up to 1440p neutralized the
performance advantage of the more
expensive Intel processors when using
the RX 470 here all four tested
processors averaged 57 FPS with a 48 FPS
minimum testing the Mafia 3 shows the G
45 60 maxing out the rx 470 at 1080p
with a minimum of 36 fps and an average
of 42 fps jumping to 1440p provides
similar results and here the RX 470 dips
down at 25 FPS on all four CPUs gives a
vol 4 is a very CPU demanding game and
here the G 45 60 was found to be 17%
slower than the core i7 processor when
using the rs4 70 that said it was 30%
slower one pair with the gtx 1060 so a
definite improvement then moving a 1440p
the g 45 60 was pretty well able to get
the most out of the RX 470 with an
average of 47 FPS and a minimum of 39
FPS the pentium g 45 60 performed very
well when testing with titanfall 2 and
at 1080p it was roughly able to match
the other cpus tested this was also at
1440p
here the g 45 60 RX 4 70 , averaged 64
FPS with a 57 FPS minimum the G 45 60
delivered similar performance with the
rx 470 as it did when paired with the
GTX 1060 in civilization 6 this man is a
good bit slower than the other
processors tested despite still
delivering playable performance
even at 1440p the G 4560 lags behind
that said was the Rx for seven installed
the minimum frame rate didn't take the
same hit only dropping down to 37 fps
the RX 470 and G 45 60 combo performs
well when testing with Call of Duty
infinite warfare and here it wasn't a
great deal slower than the Core i5 and
core i7 processors those margins seen at
an EP were eliminated a 1440p and here
all four processes allow for 49 FPS
minimum with a 52 FPS average okay so
we're done and dusted 17 games from 2016
now tested nothing else to see them how
I almost forgot Grand Theft Auto 5 due
to popular demand I have updated the
results with this two year old title and
I have to admit it makes sense given not
just how popular the game is but also
how CPU demanding it is using the high
quality settings with MSAA and advanced
graphical options disabled we were for
the most part removing any GPU
bottlenecks therefore if you were to
crank up the visual quality settings a
bit more these margins would likely be
reduced what's key to note here is that
with any of the three GPU configurations
tested the G 45 60 provided smooth
playable performance and frame rates
never dip below 60 FPS jumping the 1440p
we can see that the margins within the
dual-core and quad-core processors is
slightly reduced again the G 45 60
allowed for at least 60 FPS at all times
the penny of G 45 60 and rx 470 looked
to be a match made in heaven for budget
PC gamers the combo costs just 235
dollars u.s. or 360 ozzie and that
enables some very impressive ke pede
gaming performance and honestly 1440p
performance is also on the table so
let's take a look at how the G 45 60
compares with the rx 470 the GTX 1060
and the gtx 750ti
okay we can see that the G 45 60 dropped
just 5% when going from the GTX 1060 to
the RX 470 meanwhile it was 24% faster
with the rx 470 when compared to the GTX
1050 TI
now when compared to the core i5 7600 K
for example the G 45 60 was 20% slower
when compared with the GTX 1060 that
said that margin was slightly reduced
with the rx 470 down to 17 percent so
the i5 7600
is clearly able to get quite a bit more
out of the RX 470 in these cpu-intensive
titles that said prices almost four
times more it's not exactly a
significant loss for the budget
dual-core processor anyway what we are
seeing here is without question the
worst case scenario for the G 4560 when
paired with either the rx 470 or GTX
1060 graphics cards so then what do
these results look like if we compare
the minimum frame rate from all 18 games
tested as in not excluding those GPU
limited titles such as Far Cry primal
for example including the non CPU
intensive games doesn't significantly
change the picture but it does reduce
the margin between the G 4560 and the
higher-end Core i5 and i7 processors as
we expected we see rx 470 handling the
rendering work the G 45 60 is now just
13% slower than the core i5 7600 K the G
45 60 might not have quite enough grunt
to fully utilize the rx 470 and every
game out there but even where it
struggles we still received perfectly
playable performance in almost every
title anyway in fact the only exception
was rise of the Tomb Raider out of the
18 games tested and I'm still not quite
sure what the issue there is anyway bang
for your buck when it comes to new PC
how are nothing in my opinion beats the
G 45 16 our x4 70 combo hopefully you
want to happy with the testing that's
been done here and by adding those GTA 5
results that'll get me out of trouble if
so consider hitting the like button and
maybe even sharing this video I'm your
host Steve and I'll catch you for
another big benchmark video really soon
