on today's episode of unboxing boxes I
again just have two boxes that we'll be
unboxing but before we get to that I
thought I'd just discuss a few topics
and a few things that relate to what
we've been doing recently the top of the
agenda is the thermal take a riser cable
that we looked up last week in the core
p3 build we had some problems there and
quite a few other people have as well
evidently
I spoke to thermaltake on Friday and I
mentioned the issue and as a few of you
actually pointed out in that video the
timing was quite coincidental because
Thermaltake just announced plans for a
new and improved riser cable and they
show me that was coming they've shown it
off on their YouTube channel so if
you're interested check that out but
basically they will be getting me two of
them and from what I've seen so far they
look very very similar to that Leigh
only cable that I purchased for one
hundred and twenty dollars to solve my
problem they just won't be a couple of
feet long like that one was so that's
good news I think well first of all
we've got to see how well they work I
look like they'll work well and then the
other big big issue is the price so I
don't know if they're gonna be able to
offer properly shielded cables that are
quite durable for the hundred and six
hundred twenty us they're asking for
their current cables so I mean if they
can deliver it for that price or similar
to that price then that'd be fantastic
but yeah since all the other ones are
well north of $100 I'm not sure what to
expect really but they said as soon as
they get some in they'll send them my
way and give me all the appropriate
information so you will probably see me
playing with the new thermal tape riser
cables sometime in the near future on
this unboxing segment moving on I've
been quite busy over the last few weeks
or it's been quite disorganized you
haven't really noticed on the channel
we've done a pretty good job of getting
videos out but at the moment we're we're
downstairs in my house and that's where
I've built the studio and this it's a
six meter by four meter room so it's not
huge but it's not small and we've got
obviously
I've built they shell see which is our
backdrop and they're good for storing
all our boxes they're quite high they
got quite a few meters we've got a
hypocrite over here which I might show
you but it's not really worth seeing and
then my personal computer and the
benchmark computer just one of them is
sort of crammed down in the corner over
here because upstairs where I have my
bigger office where I normally do most
of my work I'm changing it all because
that I basically because I'm doing
filming here or a lot more film than I
was since I was doing none about a month
ago but basically the office was a bit
of a mess upstairs i purpose-built it
for what I was doing and then as that
slowly changed we ripped things out
change things and it just became a
horrible mess so I've ripped it all
apart completely trashed the whole room
and I've been rebuilding what will be an
alternate set up there which will
probably be more of a benchmark set I'd
say so when we do those big benchmark
videos I'll probably present them up
there and when we do more hands-on
testing and stuff it'll make more sense
to do it up there in the lab I've been
feel I filmed how it was the mess so
you'll get to see what we came from and
I've been filming it as I've been
modifying and you know building things
nuts not so much you know the hands-on
stuff just been showing the stage as
quickly as I try to get through it I'm
hoping to have it done quite soon but
yeah these things can take longer than
anticipated so we'll see how we go but
probably next month I'll start releasing
some footage in the unboxing series of
how the office is going and yeah give
you guys an update on all that sort of
stuff and on that note I do have plans
to sort of change the channel ever so
slightly not not drastically like the
benchmarks will be the same and all the
video content will be much the same but
just have a more personal approach with
the channel so show you guys way more
behind the scenes sort of stuff cuz we
haven't really done any of that to this
point and you guys have been asking us
you're asking so and that's a big reason
why I've decided to renovate the office
upstairs to make it more basically
better for that sort of stuff so we can
do more hands-on stuff and more behind
the scenes stuff so there'll be yeah
that'll be sort of one direction that I
plan to take the channel in
next year so that should be fun
and I think that pretty much covers
everything for now so we probably should
start unboxing some boxes I'll start
with this bigger one
it's another I had to rip the shipping
label off it but it looks like it's
another Logitech box all right do we
have here it's definitely a Logitech box
it looks like it's Logitech snoozy three
three seven speakers cool 80 watts
I assume that's peak power bluetooth I'm
off to do some quick research on these
so I can give you some information but
before I do that let's take them out of
the box and have a look it's quite a
small box so I'm not sure how big the
speaker system is presumably small on
the box yeah it looks like we've got a
little controller here they must be the
satellite speakers it is a 2.1 system
from what I can tell on the box sit that
there let's have a lawful we got here
that looks like it's a nice small little
compact 2.1 system why'd you take I've
done plenty of compact two-point ones in
the past so we have a little subby here
there's four ICS on the back I'd say at
least two of them protecting the
satellite speakers and there's also a
3.5 millimeter you valeri input which we
would probably connect from your PC
right I'll move that to the side so
here's the controller
yeah pretty simple left is lower right
is higher I think Bluetooth button for
connecting up your phone or tablet or if
it's that's pretty cool I like a a lot
of these new desktop speakers are taking
advantage of bluetooth and with everyone
using their smart phone so much now
that's
very handy and the on/off button so on
you've got a headphone jack as well and
it looks like there's a reasonable
amount of cable there so you should be
able to get it to a nice spot on your
desk yeah it's pretty cool
and then you can turn up the gain on the
base a subwoofer here minimum maximum so
that's pretty cool very very
surprisingly light but I mean it is
small and there we go one of these
satellite speakers they're wrapped in a
it's almost like a sort of a metallic e
looking material dark grey not not quite
black but yeah although they look pretty
cool so there's two of those so yeah
there you go the new Logitech z3 three
sevens they cost about a hundred dollars
Aziz that's pretty cheap really
presuming you're assuming rather they
sound quite good there the whole
system's rated at 40 watt RMS so that's
pretty decent I mean yeah it's
definitely gonna your neighbors or know
about if you crank them up the two
satellites feature three inch convex
dome drivers eight watt RMS each and
then the subwoofer has a five and a
quarter inch front firing dome driver so
there you go the new Logitech desktop
speakers that are reasonably priced and
they support bluetooth so you may see a
review on them shortly the next and last
box cool you guys a lot well some of you
guys will like this anyway we have
gigabytes gtx 1050 TI graphics card and
we have gigabytes 1050 graphics card so
that is the 2 gigabyte model so that's
the standard memory and the full
gigabyte 1050 Ti and they're both the g1
gaming model so we'll take them out of
the box and have a bit of a
look at them previously I've had the
base model MSI they're just yeah the OSI
models the 1050 and 1050 Ti from MSI
which is what we used in our original
review and they're tiny little cards but
they work quite well and there they both
meet the MSRP
but these g1 gaming cards should be yes
there are a bit more substantial
so again apart from the graphics card
there's nothing else in the package so
what did I open here that's that this is
the tii model so there you go the g1
gaming 1050 tii it that this does have a
6 pin connector so I haven't used a 1050
graphics card with an external PCIe
connector power connector so that's cool
and it also has a full-length backplate
so I know although you guys will like
that as well so that's pretty cool for a
budget card hopefully the price reflects
that it's still a budget card and it
looks like wow there's three HDMI
outputs yep three HDMI outputs and a
single DisplayPort and Angel link DVI
port I can get the cover off it so
hopefully you guys can see that might
add some b-roll over it will see yeah so
I mean the cooler on it is way way
bigger than what's on the MSI card so I
would assume or expect this thing to run
very very cool I'll definitely be
reviewing this card a probably next week
I'll get around to doing that and we'll
see if there if the 1050 model is the
same obviously it has got 1050 GPU and
only 2 GB of ddr2 memory or gddr5 memory
looking very similar
very similar indeed the camera battery
just went flat so hopefully not too much
of that got cut out at a bit of a
problem with that last week I did about
four tags or something because I had the
mic preamp went flat and the mic went
flat camera went flat and bloody
batteries do something about them anyway
where was I
that's right I was talking about the
vanilla 1050 g1 gaming - you go
background scale and it looks like again
you get three HDMI outputs one display
for one jewel link DVI port full
backplate on the card it looks like the
same exact same cooler you get another 6
pin PCI II power input looks like the
same fan setup fan shroud LED lights the
whole lot so that's a pretty serious
graphics card
what's the MSRP on the 1050 again I
think it's 110 dollars u.s. so I'll have
a quick look at pricing now and let you
guys know what I find so yeah this card
is 205 dollars ozzie or a hundred and
forty US and I have to say that's pretty
pricey for a vanilla 1050 I'm not yeah I
US availability is not great at the
moment so that $30 over the MSRP may
come down as availability picks up but
yeah time over 140 US for this card mmm
expensive and the 1050 Ti to know how to
say this it's currently a 170 US which
is as many of you guys know Rx 4:17
money so again not sure about that one
or two hundred and forty-five ozzie so
they are good looking cards but yeah
that's quite a premium to pay over this
model which should deliver pretty
similar performance so this one is the
again this is the 1050 2 gigabyte model
and this is the to you by gigabyte model
so this one you're paying 110 for this
one you're paying 130 US for
yeah so hopefully this one's worth it
maybe at overclocks better better
performance I don't know based on what
we've seen from Pascal with the 1060
there 1070 the 1080 and so on that yeah
adding more power important stuff
doesn't really help you squeeze much
more performance out so I don't think
it's gonna justify that kind of
percentage increase in price but we'll
find out that's what the reviews for so
we've got two graphics card reviews
which will probably be coming up next
week sit there you go probably do a
logitech speaker review because they
look quite interesting and quite
reasonably priced I think I've done a
huge amount of research yet almost
available but $100 Aussie for a system
of that quality seems pretty good to me
and yeah this week on the channel I have
an interesting video I hope it is
interesting anyway basically it's a look
at PCI Express performance using high
end graphics cards looking at the third
generation second generation of first
generation PCIe specifications or
revisions so you obviously have I think
it's four gigs for the first revision
eight gigs for the second revision and
16 gigabytes per second for the third
revision in the past we found that
doesn't make much difference to
performance but I recently been updating
all my CPU results in the wake of the
new upcoming AMD and Intel processors in
late December probably January and I was
testing the old Sandy Bridge stuff and
noticed it was quite a bit slower than I
was expecting with graphics cards such
as the Titan XP in relation to skylake
and whatnot like quite a lot slower and
part of that was to do with the PCIe
bandwidth or at least I thought I did
you'll have to watch the video to find
out but not a huge amount of testing but
it's kind of interesting yeah and that's
what's coming this week also I'll
probably get up a review of samsung's
new 960 Evo SSD and I won't just provide
benchmark numbers in graphs that I'll
actually do some some screen capture
stuff
using an external device to show like
compare it to maybe like the crucial MX
300 and even a hard drive show the
system booting up loading things like a
dope premiere a couple of games and
stuff so that should be pretty
interesting as well and then I should
probably get a review on that Western
Digital WD blue one terabyte SSD as well
so I don't know whether that'll be later
this week or I'll squeeze that into next
week we'll see I think that's about
everything for this week anyway and then
there's some cool stuff coming of the
week after I finally get around to doing
that and yeah hopefully on next week's
episode as well I'll show you some
footage of the office and what I'm doing
and up there so that should be pretty
interesting I think you guys will like
that
and that about wraps this one up I'm
your host Steve thanks for watching guys
and I will see you throughout the week
with more exciting content bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
