have another episode of unboxing boxes
and we have quite a few boxes to get
through plenty of things been piling up
while I've been focusing on those Raven
Ridge ap use so I thought let's take a
break from all that benchmarking and
unboxing boxes I think we might start
with this box here
he looks pretty keen ready to go and it
is wrapped in the black garbage bag
let's say it's just a black shrink wrap
thing but we know the good folks over at
PC Caskey like to do that so good chance
this is something from PC case key I
actually hope it is because they've got
a few bits I want for a little tiny
Raven Ridge build so we'll get into that
first we've got a heap of other stuff to
check out that we'll start with this
looks like a box today a lot of a lot of
be quiet dark power pro 11 power
supplies come in I don't think they've
sent me a heap of platinum power
supplies though that would be cool if
they did all right kick starting things
off we have my new tp-link modem router
won't go into that though because I've
just bought that for personal use
probably won't interest to many of you
then we have the Celsius s 24 which is a
240 millimeter all-in-one a liquid
cooler from fractal design and I do have
a fractal design build coming up
probably next week or yeah soon on the
channel and this will be part of that
build so I won't pull that apart and
have a close look at it just now I
actually want to focus on something else
and it would be what's in this bland
looking box and now this is the Chopin
and a lot of people call it Chopin but
it's actually pronounced a Chopin
so whatever but it is an in win Mini ITX
case and you probably have guessed I
want to do a tiny little Raven Ridge
gaming PC with this case I think that
would be pretty cool
the guys over at PC case Kia or
recommended I get the silver model and I
have to say it already looks pretty
special wow that's a smart looking a
little mini ITX case so you can orient
this little guy
in one of two ways it can lay flat like
that which is sort of you know a home
theater PC kind of look or you can stand
it up like a more traditional sort of
desktop PC either way it looks really
cool plenty of mesh here on top for
airflow plenty on the which would be
also the top depending on which way if
you stand it up or lay it flat but the
tops let's say some rubber feet at the
bottom which could also be the side
I'm just confusing myself with all this
but anyway we have some nice aluminium
silver trim the whole way around the
edge there which looks fantastic I think
it looks a bit fancier a bit more
eye-catching than the black trim but
either way you can get it in black or
silver depending on which one you prefer
those of you wondering this thing costs
one hundred and ten dollars ozzie and
you can get a PC case key for that price
I'm not sure about us pricing I wasn't
really able to find it for sale in the
US so not sure what's going on with
availability there whether it's just out
of stock at the moment or they're not
currently selling it in the US so as you
might have guessed being as tall or
thick as it is you can't actually fit a
discreet graphics card in this thing so
it's more of well I suppose before the
Raven Ridge AP use came along it's
probably more of a mini office type PC
but now that you can put a 2,400 year or
a 2200 G in this thing you should better
get some pretty decent gaming especially
in your eSports type titles also
included in the hundred and ten dollar
asking price is a bronze rated power
supply 150 watt output so that should be
more than enough for even the Raven
Ridge with the Vega 11 integrated
graphics your 2400 G so yeah very candid
about building this and see what kind of
performance you can get maybe make up a
console killer kind of hate that term
but anyway and for those of you that
might want to overclock your Raven Ridge
apu in this case you are limited to a
cooler that is 43 centimeters tall
so that's the maximum height you have
there on the CPU cooler and with the
system empty because it is a common it's
a basically a steel chassis steel frame
with steel door panels and then it is
wrapped in the aluminium trim to give it
a bit of a fancy look anyway you guys
will see much more of this little guy in
a video soon when I do do that mini APU
build all right next up I think we'll
get rid of this little bag here see
what's in this guy this is actually also
from PC case get I've been spoiling me
this way let's have a look at what else
they've sent over okay not really have
many ideas just yet ah this is a very
nice they are spoiling me indeed while
I'll be using probably this here so this
is an 8 gigabyte kit - 4 gigabyte DIMMs
it's ddr4 3000 and the guys at PC case
care told me this works a treat with the
new Raven Ridge AP use and it's also
quite cost-effective certainly more so
than the 16 gigabyte kit that they've
also sent along quite nice of them
so they're both CL 16 kits with for the
primary timing 1618 1838 at one point
three five volts so these guys come in
the gray black which you can see here
and here or you can get them in red
black which is kind of cool for you your
AMD themed builds as well but it is the
T Force dark ddr4 memory also as a
gaming in the name of course yeah
apparently this worked really well with
the array from Ridge AP use so that's
what I'll be doing in the in Wind Chopin
I'll be sticking the a gigabyte kit in
there
but you could also get 16 gigabytes if
you had money to burn so yeah again
thank you to PC case key for sending
along all this memory I will put it to
good use uh will just randomly pick one
from over here got a random box alright
let's have a look will open this one
together it's always a bit of fun if I
can cut all the tape off
you guys ready hmm I'll admit that
wasn't our the most exciting we've got
more memory here come on Wow Wow
that is a bit fancy so it looks like we
have the new g.skill sniper X ddr4 3600
wow I'm actually really keen to try that
with the Raven Ridge ap use certainly
not cost-effective but yeah be
interesting to see if it will run at
3,600 on those things and what kind of
performance we get out of the graphics
so we have a 16 gigabyte kit so 2 8
gigabyte sticks and that is CL 1919 1939
at one point 35 volts Wow ok let's have
a have a closer look at these guys cuz
this this is new memory I haven't seen
this stuff before so their new sniper X
memory it comes in one of three flavors
I suppose so we have the I think they
call this urban camo it's like your sort
of concrete looking camo your greys and
a bit of black in there it actually
looks pretty cool that'll look good on a
lot of motherboards so here's quickly
the new sniper x-series comes in one of
three themes so you've got your classic
camo which is pretty much the same as
this but it's your green so your jungle
forest type themed ones and then this is
the urban camo which is the concrete
jungle type look I suppose and then
there's a third option called digital
camo so yeah your matrix type theme I
suppose it's yeah it's sort of a yellowy
greeny kind of yeah it looks kind of
cool I think of the three of them
probably the classic camo looks a bit
odd they say these are targeted at case
modders not so much enthusiasts Sofia
making a jungle type theme I suppose the
classic camo would be pretty cool with
that but I yeah I don't know about that
I think they probably they might have
seen better sales if they had I've done
like you know a black and red camo for
your AMD type build and maybe a blue and
black
sort of camo for Intel bills green seems
a bit out of place I don't know yeah
that's very niche therefore even the
modders I would have thought but anyway
there are three options to choose those
three options to choose from
it's what I'm trying to say and I think
they are the urban camo V the concrete
jungle that I have here looks pretty
cool I think that'll suit most
motherboards quite nicely and then you
do have the silver strip there and then
the rest of the heat spread is black but
you won't see most of that anyway very
keen to put these in a build soon and
show them off all right I think we'll
get this big yellow box out of the light
and it's very heavy very heavy so well
see what is in here alright there's not
too much excitement to see just yet this
is heavy
oh wow mmm okay that looks pretty good
and this also looks interesting yep I've
got everything alright looks like here
we have asrock delivering the goods the
x2 99m extreme 4th I've heard about this
board I don't believe it's on their
website at least at the time we're
filming this and it's definitely not on
sale yet at least at the present point
in time so I suppose we should probably
open this up and have a closer look ok
so a pretty plain looking IO shield
nothing too fancy there I think this
probably is not necessarily to
complement but they released an X 399
micro ATX motherboard recently that was
very impressive I will be featuring that
to build soon but this is the X 299
version of that board
I suppose excuse me
this knife is not cable tie rated almost
got it there we go okay so a compact X
299 motherboard not quite as compact as
the Mini ITX version that we put in this
bill here if you can see that that was
my crazy micro ATX mini ITX tail build
this is micro ATX but yeah so not that
small but the advantage of it being a
micro ATX rather mini ITX is that you
get these standard memory modules
instead of the laptop stuff you get two
authors what we got here we got two PCI
Express x 16 slots that are wired for x
16 bandwidth then we were a third one at
the bottom here which is a full length
slot but it's only wired for for Thomas
bandwidth by the look of it we've got
eight SATA ports on board we have two
ultra m2 ports so the the extra 99 board
had three but of course you do get more
PCI Express Lanes on that particular
platform it's good we have true 8 pin
power inputs so you can feed in plenty
of power for overclocking those core i9
CPUs that tend to run quite hot looks
like we have a very impressive erm have
no details about that but yeah details
to follow the heatsink here isn't
actually cooling anything directly it's
just connected via a heat pipe off this
one here
so that isn't coming in contact with
anything there via rooms or the top you
know the vom components 5 fan headers
absolutely nothing on the back of the
board
so I think this is meant to be a
cost-effective micro ATX x-29
motherboard so it looks very good keen
to give that a go I don't know what
build will put that in no doubt
something will come up in the
not-too-distant future
but your no pricing information at this
point because as I'm filming this it's
yet to go on sale and asrock haven't
even released any official information
about it there you go we have it so it
exists and you'll probably be able to
buy it quite soon ok another product
that's yet to go on sale is the I think
this
is let's have a look the desk mini so
it's a mini PC that's probably designed
to sit on your desk so desk mini not a
mini desk makes perfect sense
while that logic though I'm surprised
that B box wasn't called the VESA mount
mini or something like that or maybe
this should be called the bumblebee box
yeah anyway okay so this particular
model I've just got a little sticky here
telling me hopefully everything I need
to know
it has a gtx 1060 that's an MX M card in
there and it is a zed 370 our version on
the motherboard so said 370 chipset so
that's very interesting so it's a coffee
like desk mini so we've already seen the
KB Lake models using the be 250 chips
that I think it was I have to look that
up but yeah I think so you wouldn't be
over you wouldn't have been able to
overclock on the previous model whereas
this model you should be able to to some
degree though I imagine cooling may be
an issue I think I'll provide a full
review on this shortly so included in
the package we get a very large power
brick now it says 19 volts at 11 and a
half amps it doesn't say the output but
that would be about 220 watts so 220
watts oh yeah you should be outta with
the GTX 1060 there should be a bit of
overclocking Headroom there anyway
that'll all come in the review and then
here is the unit itself so I can get it
out without dropping everything ok so a
very compact little PC even smaller than
the Chopin case that we just looked up
so there's the Chopin and there is the
desk in E so yeah the desk Mini is quite
a bit smaller and you can put I assume
8700 K in there or at least an 8700 with
a gtx 1060 so that's gonna actually
smoke this though I probably smokes it
in terms of costs as well being this is
much more expensive the bare-bones model
with the b250 chipset with the
1060 that was almost I think it was
around $800 us and that doesn't include
ddr4 memory doesn't include the
processor and it doesn't include any
storage so it is a bare bone you get the
motherboard and the graphics card it
looks like you do get a cooler we'll
have a quick look inside actually and
see what's in this guy
okay so I'll throw up some b-roll to
give you guys a better look but that's
roughly what's inside so that would be
your GTX 1060 under that and that will
be your coffee like CPU under there it
looks like for my particular review
sample asrock has kindly provided some
ddr4 memory and they've also provided a
CPU wow that's pretty awesome they've
included a core i7 8700 in there so that
is going to be very cool for testing
well I can't wait to get to this so we
have an 80 core i7 8700 so I'm not sure
if it supports the K models or not it
might be limited to 65 watts will I'm
gonna have some fun testing that that's
for sure but anyway that will be on the
channel very soon so as you can see that
does have the stock Intel Box cooler
there's plenty of ventilation there's
plenty of ventilation in the lid so
getting airflow in there shouldn't be
too much for a problem but it is the
stock box cooler which is pretty crummy
not sure if there's many aftermarket
solutions you can get though that are
better that fit in that area so yeah
I'll have to look into that and it has a
pair of eight gigabyte ddr4 2400 memory
modules so 16 gigabytes of ddr4 2400
looks like you got plenty of USB 3 HDMI
output you've got display output H to my
output looks like mini DisplayPort
Gigabit LAN and then the DC power input
for the power brick so very sleek and I
see your type C and USB 3 at the front
with an audio jacket yeah sleek
nice-looking little system there so
that's gonna be very interesting to
compare that to what we can do with the
Raven Ridge apu obviously this has more
power and costs more so yeah it'll be
interesting to see how those two
stack up over roll all right okay we'll
get the very blunt and pathetic knife
back out because we have another box and
it's quite heavy for what it is you
would expect this to be a relatively
light box but it's quite a few kilos of
weight in this thing that makes sense
why is a power supply I've opened it
backwards and upside down today there
you go the fractal design Edison M 750
watt 80 plus gold certified power supply
now this unit here does weigh well the
box has 3.1 kilos that's why it was
quite heavy but it is a semi modular
power supply so the 24 pin power and
probably the 8 pin power fixed into
place but the peripheral and PCIe power
cables modular it comes with a five-year
warranty the unit itself is 160
millimeters long and yeah that's about
it for now I will be featuring this in a
build with the the all-in-one from
fractal design that we looked at at the
start off briefly talked about saw unbox
just the box not the product anyway
we'll do the same with this let's move
on in here we have a very well I don't
know what we have in here we have a very
light box from Corsair getting a bit
ahead of myself there ah yes very good
okay what we have here are three
controllers yes perfect that's yes
that's what I mean after three LED
controllers for the you can't really see
MIT I have a whole stack of ml 120 and
140 fans there and I can't control the
LED function or any of them because the
commander controller doesn't allow that
you need to plug this into the commander
anyway I have three of these now so I
have a very awesome Corsair build coming
up shortly and I will be using these in
that build second last box what do we
have
yeah I think a variety of things by the
look of it all right here we go no
that's just like one big lump okay we
have a pair of 128 gigabyte nvme SSDs so
therefore a build then we have a whole
heap of ddr4 memory a lot of ddr4 memory
in this episode ray from rich comes out
and everyone goes crazy for ddr4 memory
so we have a 16 gigabyte kit of 2666
memory here we have a 16 gigabyte kit of
ddr4 3000 memory here and we have a 2666
kit again 16 gigabytes so loads of
memory now one of these kits I think
it's this kit here the fancy looking
stuff with the aura sync LED lights I'm
giving this away on the channel we're
doing another four channel giveaway with
two full pcs I won't be building one of
them this time I'm taking the easy way
out just giving away a component and I
thought 16 you give ddr4 3000 that's a
pretty sweet prize so this will be given
away assume details will be coming in
another video soon so you can enter to
win this 2 pcs and there are a few other
components as well so very cool but that
well actually is one more thing one more
thing almost at the end of this episode
we have the these were very popular at
Computex last year they are the game
storm MF 120 frameless fans and I
haven't actually seen these or but I've
seen them at Computex but I haven't got
them since then so it's been quite some
time since we did see them at Computex
and deep cool said we have a special
version of these fans we would like to
send you just for you that's a present I
was like sure I like presents
who doesn't send them along so I'm not
sure what to expect here Oh
that is cool we have to provide some
b-roll of that so here are the frameless
fans from deep cool with their aluminium
frame and on these ones that says harbor
unbox and I believe that is LED backlit
RGB LED backlit so I'm gonna have to
plug those in I'll throw up some b-roll
of them plugged in so you can see how
they look but thank you very much deep
cool these are awesome well okay so I
get three of them that's that's very
nice indeed I'm gonna have to put them
up somewhere and then there's the
controller the MF control so the fans
plug in there and you can control that
just as the name suggests awesome well
thank you again deep cool I'm very keen
to plug these in hopefully you guys know
what they look like and hopefully they
looked very impressive well that's going
to do it for this episode of unboxing
boxes memory edition hope you guys
enjoyed unboxing all the new hardware
some very exciting new products some yet
to be even really officially announced
products like the asrock motherboard and
the desk mini pc case very exciting
stuff and i have plenty of work ahead of
me if I didn't already thanks for
watching guys
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
