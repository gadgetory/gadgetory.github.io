late last year I check out Intel's new
or rather at the time it was their
upcoming core i3 73 50k processor that
video was titled an unlocked core i3
should you buy it and the answer that
question was pretty much a no at $180 us
or 270 dollars ozzie the 73 50k is a
mighty expensive dual-core processor and
for just $20 us more you can land the
quad core Core i5 7400 meanwhile both
confusingly cost the same amount down
under this thing has quite a few of you
asking me the question should you buy
the core i3 73 50k or the core i5 7400
since they both cost about the same
amount the advantage of the slightly
more expensive Core i5 7400 processor is
as quad core design and larger level 3
cache the disadvantage being that it's
locked at a base clock frequency of just
3 gigahertz with a maximum single
cooperating frequency of 3.5 gigahertz
there's a bit more to this comparison
but let's start with the headlines the
core i3 7350 county other hand comes
clocked at least 20% higher 40% higher
in fact when comparing the core i5s base
clock frequency this is also an unlocked
k processor which means it can be
overclocked to achieve even greater
frequencies I've got my chip up to 4.8
you go Hertz without much fuss and that
means it's clocked almost 40 percent
above the core i5s maximum turbo boost
frequency a clock speed advantage of
roughly 40 to 60 percent is huge and
with its hyper threading support the 73
50 K should really challenge the 7400
there are however a few other factors at
play here which make the 70 350 K a
whole lot less enticing before we even
get to the benchmarks consumers can
pretty much get the most out of the core
i5 7400 on a $50.00 h1 10 motherboard
with the standard Intel Box cooler
meanwhile the 73 50k requires a ZD
series motherboard and with Zed 170
boards starting at $90 and the 270
boards at 110 dollars that's quite a bit
more not only that but the 73 50k
requires an aftermarket cooler so you
can add at least another $30 to the
price tag there for consumers are
looking at spending around $250 for the
core i5
7400 and an entry-level motherboard
meanwhile the 7350 cables that you back
at least $350 of the basic Zed 170 board
and a budget tower style air cooler so
in the end you're paying about 20% more
for the 73 50k and it's required
components keeping all that in mind how
do the two compares well let's go find
out first up let's check out the single
and multi-threaded performance using
Cinebench r15 here we see that despite a
massive clock speed advantage this 73
50k is still quite a bit slower than
7400 run comparing the multi-threaded
performance that said when overclocked
the 73 50k does look to be around 40%
faster for single threaded tasks excel
is an application that has no problem
utilizing a large number of threads and
as such the core i5 7400 performs much
better than the 73 50k even when
overclocked for 73 50k simply couldn't
match the 7400 taking over 10% longer to
complete the workload
surprisingly the overclocked 7350 k1
able to nudge your head of the 7400 in
our 7-zip benchmark that said it was
just 4 percent faster for any kind of
encoding work having 4 physical cores
will always trump two cores with
hyper-threading and we see that here
when testing with Premiere Pro CC even
at 4.8 gigahertz the 73 50k with 4
percent slower than the 7400 taking 18
minutes and 16 seconds to complete the
workload okay so time for some games
starting with overwatch we fund the
overclocked 73 50k is able to edge out
the 7400 delivering a 3% higher average
frame rate keep in mind that these
results were gathered using the Titan XP
at 1080p
the overclocked 73 50k was able to edge
out the 7400 when testing Gears of War
for that said it was just 5% faster when
comparing the average frame rate
although the unlocked core i3 processor
sees a rather large 17 percent
performance boost from its 4.8 gigahertz
overclock it was still only able to
match the performance of the 7400 for
our battlefield 1 test
interestingly that also places both
processes on par with the Sandy Bridge
core i7 2670 4.8 gigahertz overclocked
to 73 50k couldn't beat the slightly
more expensive Core i5 processor and
watchdogs too despite seeing a 13%
performance boost the core i3 processor
was only able to match the 7400 well for
me this
really sums the situation up well the
overclocked 73 50k was 10% slower in the
Excel workload and yet it consumed
almost eighty percent more power than
the 7400 for those wondering what you
are looking at here is total system
consumption finally here the power
consumption results are running the
prime95 stress test as you can see the
overclocked 7350 K consumes almost as
much power as a core i7 6700 K
unfortunately despite being a lot of fun
the core i3 7350 overclocking really
doesn't make a whole lot of sense for
the most part to stop clock 7400 is just
as fast or faster consume significantly
less power runs much cooler and
ultimately ends up costing less so as I
said in my original review back in
December the 73 50k really should be
avoided in fact that really does go for
the entire cable eight core i3 range and
even the higher clocked Pentium model
such as the G 40 646 20 at least given
the current pricing landscape the reason
for this is Intel's own G 45 60 which
I've already looked at extensively on
the channel retailing for just $64 u.s.
it's an incredibly good buy it's 22%
cheaper than the G 4600 which costs
eighty two dollars and yet it's clocked
just three percent slower it's the same
we're looking at the G 46 20 the G 45 60
is 31 percent cheaper while it can't
possibly be more than five percent
slower move to the core i3 range and we
find the core i3 7100 retailing for 117
dollars EOS now other than a bump in
operating frequency and a slight
modification to the integrated graphics
this is the exact same processor clocked
at 3.9 gigahertz it's up to 11% faster
that doesn't have a make it worth paying
over eighty percent more for it gets
worse as you go on the core i3 7300
costs well over twice the price but
comes clocked to less than 15% greater
so as I see it consumers looking at
buying a new seventh generation Intel
processor have the choice of the pentium
g 45 60 at $64 or the core i5 7400 at
$200 as crazy as it sounds everything
else in between is a bit pointless
anyway I hope those trying to decide
between the core i3 73 50k in the core
i5 7500 K now know the right move to
make if you would like to see any other
CPU comparison
on the channel please let me know in the
comments below more than happy to make
it happen I'm your host Steve and I hope
to catch you on another video
really soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
