gonna make this fun a little more brief
than I would like to because I'm about
to leave for a week long holiday and of
course the one week of the year that I
decided to take off in video releases a
GPU that said I knew that one of the big
three AMD Intel Nvidia would release
something and it turns out it was the
Green Team the other videos you might
have seen this week featuring yours
truly they were created in advance so I
did them before I had to go my holiday
so anyway I'm meant to be kayak fishing
with my mates right now so I don't have
time for mega benchmark video at least
not until later next week thankfully I
was able to get all my testing done
before I had to leave and I filmed the a
role so my sort of intron outro for this
video I did that in my studio and I got
a bit of b-roll and then I just had to
do the voice-over stuff or I will have
to do the voice-over stuff and a little
bit of video editing at the house that
I'm staying at on the beach so anyway
that might be too much of an issue and
we should probably just get down to
business before we get to that this
video is brought to you by as rock and
there's m390 Tai Chi ultimate
motherboard this flagship quality board
fully supports Intel's ninth gen 8 core
processors thanks to a 10 phase vrm
design and you get a quantity at 10
gigabit per second Ethernet to learn
more check out the links in the
description below today's business of
course is in videos new churring based
gtx 1660 it's just the plain 1660 so we
looked at the Ti model not that long ago
and now we have the 1660 so the ti
version was 280 dollars u.s. and at that
price it proved to be an exceptionally
good buy and now we have this one for
220 and I think it too will prove to be
an exceptionally good buy basically it's
21 percent cheaper but packs just 8
percent fewer crew cores and going off
that you'd expect it to be just 5
percent slower on average as the base
and boost clocks are very similar
however there is one major change
whereas the 1660 Ti features a 192 bit
wide memory bus using 12 gear bits per
second G DDR 6 memory
for a bandwidth of 288 gigabytes per
second this new non TI model has been
downgraded to use gddr5 memory so while
it still supports the same 192 bit wide
memory bus the bandwidth has been
reduced by 33 percent down to 192
gigabytes per second
so that could produce some interesting
results and I don't expect the 1660 and
1660 Ti to scale evenly over all in
video says the 1660 is 30% fast on the
GTX 10 63 gigabyte and 15% fast in the
GTX 1066 gigabyte at 1080p and will
certainly investigate that claim in
video also informed us that on average
at 68% fast and the GTX 970 and a
hundred and 13% fast in the GTX 960 so
this is primarily who they're targeting
with the GTX 1660 as long as you have an
8 pin PCI power connector pretty much
good to go though you can get a 4-pin
molex adapter anyway on hand for testing
we have the MSI GTX 1660 gaming X model
which is kind of nice as our 1660 Ti
results are based on the gaming X
version and the same is true for our RT
X 2060 results so shout out to MSI for
looking after us on all these releases
and truth be told without their support
this day one content wouldn't be
possible on that note NVIDIA has also
been helpful with these churring GTX
releases promptly providing the
necessary driver so I can get on with
testing so thank you to them as well ok
so let's talk testing for this one I'll
be looking at performance and a dozen
titles and then sometime over the next
week we'll do one of our 30-plus game
benchmarks also for the focus of this
video we will be looking at 1080p
performance before we get into the
results a few quick notes on the test
system the test system used includes a
kora 999 or K clocked at 5 gigahertz
with 32 gigabytes of ddr4 3200 memory as
for the drivers were using adrenaline
2019 Edition nineteen point two point
three for the Radeon GPUs and then game
ready for 1935 whe QL for the GeForce
GPUs kick-starting the benchmarks we
have shut off the Tomb Raider and here
the new GT x16 60 performs exceptionally
well it blows the gtx 1066 year bite out
of the water by almost a 40% margin and
it's just 4% slower than the gtx
1070 and 13% slower than the 1660 TI not
only that but we're 76 FPS on average
eternity P using the highest in game
quality preset it provided an extremely
smooth enjoyable gaming experience so
we're off to a very good start there
next that we have Forza horizon for in
the GTX 1660 isn't quite as impressive
here as it only matched the rx 590
though having said that it was only
slightly sold in the GTX 1070 when
compared to the GTX 1066 gigabyte it was
also just 16% faster so again not a
particularly amazing result here moving
on the GTX 1660 average 65 fps in just
cause for at 1080p placing it roughly on
par with the Radeon rx 590 and this
minute was just 18% fast in the GTX 1066
gigabyte which again isn't a
particularly amazing result though it is
in line with what Nvidia said the card
was capable of who's also interesting
about that it was just 11% slower than
the GTX 1660 Ti so I guess in that sense
not a bad result now testing with
Resident Evil 2 we find another title
where the GTX 1660s on par with the RX
590 though this time that minute was 29%
fast in the GTX 1066 eager bite so that
is a substantial improvement not only
that but 94 FPS on average at 1080p with
the game maxed out is certainly nothing
to sneeze at moving on we have hitman 2
and this is a very CPU limited game at
1080p when using a gtx 1660 TI or better
we see the 1660 isn't quite the limits
of the CPU but even so it's still 16%
faster than the rx 590 and 29% fast and
the GTX 1066 gigabyte hitman 2 is a bit
of an odd title but even so the 1660
still performed rather well here we see
the new cheering GPU does OK in
fortnight not amazing but it certainly
does get the job done here it was just
11% fast in the GTX 1066 year by making
it 16% slow on the GTX 1070 at 18
percent slower than the GTX 1660 Ti
still with 113 fps an average using the
epic quality preset at area P it's not
exactly what you'd call slow frame rates
in Metro Exodus are good here the 1660
was just
percent slower than the TI model making
it 16 percent fast in the GTX 1060 and
then when the difference between a nice
smooth gaming experience and one with
noticeably lower frame rates we've seen
a number of times already that the
churring architecture loves Rainbow six
siege or is it Rainbow six siege it
loves during either way it's good news
for potential gtx 1660 owners here the
new budget GPU sped out an incredible
118 FPS on average 1080p using the 100%
render scale that's a whopping 36
percent performance boost over the gtx
1066 gigabyte now testing with
battlefield 5 sees the 1660 trail the TI
model by a 16 percent margin and it only
managed to match the rx 580 that said
the Radeon GPUs do perform very well in
this title still when compared to the
gtx 1066 q byte we're only looking at a
12 percent performance uplift so not
amazing gains by any stretch of the
imagination in this title the World of
Tanks performance isn't great here the
1660 is down 17% on the 1660 ti which
again isn't terrible however it does
place it basically on par with the gtx
1060 sukhiya bytes so no real
performance bump for gtx 1060 owners
even those with the measly 3 gigabyte
model second last game tested is apex
legends and here we see the 1660
providing a nice 28% performance boost
over the gtx 1066 gigabyte with an
impressive 106 FPS on average at Tony P
this minute was just 6 percent slower
than the gtx 1070 and 14% slower than
the gtx 1660 TI now for last game far
cry a new dawn and once again at the
1660 managed to match the RX 590 this
time with 87 FPS on average at 1080p and
that is excellent performance though
admittedly it was just 14 percent faster
than 1066 gigabyte and with the older
Pascal GPU spitting out 76 FPS on
average the difference wasn't really
noticeable now when it comes to power
consumption we see like the GTX 1660 Ti
this newer non ti model is extremely
fuel-efficient basically pushing total
system consumption to the same levels as
the already very efficient gtx 1066
gigabyte and of course as we just saw it
does so while delivering a
more performance so in terms of
efficiency there's really no question
about it
the 1660 is excellent the msi gtx 1660
gaming ex model that we were provided
for our day one review ran very cool and
quiet under load i couldn't hear it
above the test system and after an hour
of the f1 2018 benchmark on a loop had
picked it just 63 degrees in a 21 degree
room so impressive stuff yet again from
this new budget graphics card then when
it came time to overclock with the msi
gtx 1660 gaming x things went very
smoothly firing up the msi afterburner
utility we arrived at plus 110 for the
core and plus 900 for the gddr5 memory
this resulted in a typical core
operating frequency of 2070 megahertz
though that is just a mere 5% bump over
what you'd get out of the box that said
I was able to increase the gddr5 memory
speed by 22% and this helped to boost
frame rates by 11% in apex legends
not bad given how small the core
overclocked is clearly the 1660 is
memory limited and squeezing the most
you can out of the gddr5 memory is a
really easy way to boost frame rates
when compared head-to-head with the
radio rx 590 across the dozen games
tested so far the GTX 1660 was on
average eight percent faster so not bad
given its expected to cost around
fifteen percent less the only games
where the 1660 struggled included
battlefield 5 and Resident Evil 2 while
we saw the performance was neck-and-neck
in Far Cry New Dawn Forza horizon 4 and
Just Cause 4 then for the other seven
games tested the GeForce GPU was faster
by a 10% margin or greater the
performance increase over the GTX 1066
gigabyte varied quite a bit depending on
the title used for testing and less
demanding titles such as World of Tanks
and fortnight the gains weren't that
impressive though having said that the
same is also true for battlefield 5 so
obviously it just depends on the game
anyway on average the 1660 was 21%
faster and we saw a massive performance
gains and shut off the Tomb Raider and
Rainbow six siege then finally we have a
comparison with the GTX 1660 Ti and here
the 1660 was just 13% slower on average
and again that's a great result given
that we expected to cost around 21% less
fact the 1660 was never more than 18%
slower so in terms of value it does
clearly come out in front and we get a
better idea of just how good the 1660 is
in terms of value with this cost per
frame graph at a cost of two dollars and
forty four cents per frame based on our
testing it's actually nine percent
better value the GTX 1662 I and
impressively and even managed to edge at
the Radeon rx 580 this leaves just AMD's
rx 570 as the cost per frame champ but
as you can see the gtx 1660 was 36%
faster on average so paying a small
premium for that extra performance is
likely going to be worth it for a good
many of you overall in videos new 220
dollar u.s. mid-ranged shirring offering
is all-around excellent i've really got
nothing bad to say about it not even
anything remotely negative
I've even got used to the 16 series
naming at this point yeah that still
sucks even at 3m but seriously this is a
really good value offering from Nvidia
and it completely wipes out the GTX 1060
series so whether it's the three gear
byte or the 60 gigabyte version much
better value and it also wipes out the
rx 580 and then the 590 so the 1662 I
really took care of the 590 bang for
your buck you just can't beat it the
power efficiency is excellent an Emma
sized gaming X model that I had on hand
for testing worked like a charm ran cool
and quiet with a reasonable amount of
overclocking Headroom there's not too
much more to say really and honestly
this early in the morning I'm pretty
keen to wrap this one up get to bed and
then start the 14-hour Drive in the
morning to get to my holiday destination
so we've got a big THANK YOU to MSR for
providing their gtx 1660 gaming excuse
card and a big THANK YOU to Nvidia for
helping us get the driver so that I
could make this review happen anyway
that is going to do it for this one more
comprehensive benchmark video will be
online in about a week's time once I get
back from my holiday but if you enjoyed
