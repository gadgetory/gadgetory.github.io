Intel's latest and greatest desktop
processor on hand the 40 nanometer
Broadwell a beast that everyone seems to
be talking about you may expect me to
look a little more excited to be holding
an unlocked 10 core processor but
there's a reason for my lack of
enthusiasm the price rather than leave
the bad news to the end let's talk about
the elephant in the room yeah for some
unexplained reason intelius decided to
raise the roof and they already
extremely extreme extreme edition CPU
price frankly the core i7 59 60 X was
already a bit of a joke at a thousand
dollars and although I oh my myself and
very much like it I am the first to
admit it was never worth paying more
than double the asking price of the 47
90k for example still while Intel's
mainstream platform remains limited to
quad core eight threaded processes those
wanting more cores have had to turn to
the much more expensive LGA 2011 dash 3
platform with rumors of an upcoming 10
core i7 processor circulating for some
time now everyone including myself was
hoping expecting or just assuming that
were replaced the 59 60 X is the new one
thousand dollar extreme edition offering
sadly this hasn't been the case as would
be consumers in our face with a horrific
asking price 1750 us or 2550 australian
dollars which is probably similar money
many of you spend on your first card or
possibly even more this for me at least
makes the 650 air supreme at affair by
that i mean my initial excitement for
this product went out the door the
second i learned of the price don't care
who you are there's no possible way of
justifying that price it would have been
a challenge a thousand dollars but 1750
it's impossible still in the hope that
potential buyers offer a 14 core 28 32
xeon e5 26 a TV for instead or AMD
eventually comes out with them forcing
intel to reduce the price of the 69 50 x
we're going to take a quick look at a
few benchmarks namely premiere pro CC
and ashes of the singularity these
results are based on a premiere pro CC
workload provided by intel based on
professional level video editing using
4k 30fps
26 for mp4 footage recorded at a bit
rate of approximately 80 megabits per
second the input file sizes total 1.9
gigabytes and total two minutes and 21
seconds the audio stream is 1536
kilobits per second 48 kilohertz 16-bit
stereo in web format the performance
test measures the time to explore the
entire clip to a 4k h.264 mp4 format the
output is a high quality 4k video file
the core i7 6950 X took just 186 seconds
to complete the work load making a
twenty percent faster than the 59 60 X
and fifty-six percent faster than the
6700 k out of interest I threw in some
older Sandy Bridge processors
overclocked along with an overclocked FX
8370 processor for reference it is clear
that the 69 50x can provide serious
performance gains and extreme workloads
but does that extra twenty percent
performance over the 59 60 X justify the
almost seventy percent increase in price
I think not I know most of you guys
you're going to want to know what the
game performance looks like and I can
tell you the 69 50 X is not a gaming cpu
much like the 59 60 X which is often our
class by the much less expensive 6700 k
and 6600 k processes the only game i can
think of that would come close to
showing any benefits using a ten core
processor would be Ashley the
singularity running under DirectX 12 as
you can see when paired with the GeForce
GTX 1080 graphics card the 69 50 X was
just 2 FPS faster than the 59 60 X and
for FPS faster than 6,700 k keep in mind
this test isn't a realistic
representation of the settings gamers
are going to be using given we're only
testing a 1080p using standard or medium
quality settings using the same
unrealistic settings we also took note
of the cpu frame rate which is
essentially an estimated FPS based on
how fast the system would have been if
the system wasn't bottleneck by the GPU
let us say what would happen if we put a
much faster GPU in the system this is
actually a very accurate measure of CPU
performance here we see that when let
loose the 6950 X is a good bit faster
than 59 60 X and significantly faster
than the 60 70 okay now this is much
more like how I suspect most GD x 1080
owners will play ashes of the
singularity with the exception of the
resolution which will likely be 1440p or
greater now with more realistic settings
in play the six and
50 x 59 60 x + 6 + 700 k i'll deliver
exactly the same performance while the
overclock sandybridge processes aren't
far behind the crazy quality cpu
framerate results do favor the 69 50x
while this is great news for extreme
power users it does mean you will
require a GPU configuration there's
significantly more powerful than a
single GD x 1080 and possibly much more
powerful than even two of these flagship
graphics cards one of the most
impressive aspects to the ten core 6950
x is its efficiency here we see a total
system consumption of just 182 wats with
all 10 callers placed on a 100-percent
load that's a six percent saving over
the 59 60 X in the same system despite
the fact that we have two more higher
clock towards working at full capacity
performance wise the core i7 6950 X is
great it's at least twenty percent
faster than 59 60 X when all calls are
being utilized and it consumes less
power and a full load that's a win-win
as far as I'm concerned as mentioned in
the beginning of this short review the
issue with the 69 50 X lies squarely
with the price a 1750 us or 2550 AUD the
meds will not exist a bit like LGA 1151
broadwell processors in fact of which
there are only two so what is the
alternative for desktop users requiring
a huge amount of cause well one of my
most popular videos today was a look at
the Xeon e5 26 7 t roughly three months
ago now this eight core 16 thread
processor is based on the old sandy
bridge architecture and due to an
oversupply on the second-hand market
this one's 1550 less server processor
can be had on ebay for just 60 US
dollars and landed in Australia for as
little as seventy five dollars the good
news here is that two of these processes
can be purchased and stuck on a dual
socket server grade motherboard as a
follow up to this video I've ordered the
super micro mb dx9 dr3 for 570
australian dollars from newegg along
with a pair of xeon e5 2670 processes
the board and processor combo is worth a
little over seven hundred australian
dollars but all offers 16 cores and 32
threads it'll be super interesting to
see if you can match or even beat the
performance of the core i7 6950 x4
professional level video editing thanks
for joining me again a hard one box i'm
your host man as always if you haven't
yet hit subscribe and i'll see you guys
