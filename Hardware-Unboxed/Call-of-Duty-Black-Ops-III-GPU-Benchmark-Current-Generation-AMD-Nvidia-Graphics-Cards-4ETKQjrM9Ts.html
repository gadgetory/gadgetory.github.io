I'm your host Matt and today I'm gonna
be taking a look at how the current
generation AMD and NVIDIA graphics cards
tackle the 12th installment in the Call
of Duty series black ops 3 2015 wouldn't
be complete without a new Call of Duty
title last year was advanced warfare
this year it's the third installment in
the black ops series visually advanced
warfare was a big step forward from
previous Call of Duty titles and PC
gamers were rewarded with a superior
looking game despite using the same iw
game engine as black ops 2
we found black ops 3 to be a significant
step forward and I should point out that
the game engine has been heavily
modified developer Treyarch recommends
gamers armed themselves with at least a
2nd generation Core i5 processor or a
quad core FX processor for graphics
firepower a GTX 760 or r9 270x is
recommended we assume that's four
playable 1080p performance but those of
you considering upgrading to a current
generation mid-range to high-end
graphics card for black ops 3 we've run
some benchmarks to show you what kind of
performance you can expect the minimum
and average frame rate was recorded
using fraps at the popular 1080p
resolution as well as 1440p and 4k the
maximum in-game qualities things were
used at each resolution and we selected
the fast approximate anti-aliasing mode
otherwise known as FXAA
benchmarking takes place at the start of
the life mission then runs for about 90
seconds these are according to the
benchmark path please note that we
actually found the single-player
campaign to be more demanding than the
multiplayer portion of the game those
interested in multiplayer performance
can expect to see a 20 to 30 percent
increase in frame rates of formants over
the following results all this can see
when using it caused by one man the man
we are
we believe he's headed for the
headquarters of the Colossus corporation
yes this is a terrorist attack
the full support of you and your men
before this gets much much worse
still in there I'm still me
mind is made up
you never left me behind I'm not leaving
you
what does it want why is it doing this
right now I think it's a panic it's
diffused scared all it wants us to
ensure its own survival index represents
an opportunity
we're coming it's watching our every
move first up we see that the GeForce
GTX 970 managed a very playable 72 FPS
average at 1080p never dipped below 63
FPS the Radeon r9 390 was slightly
better with a minimum of 65 fps an
average of 74 fps beyond that the
performance continues to slowly increase
as we get to the more expensive graphics
cards before arriving in a hundred and
two frames with the gtx 980ti
increasing the resolution to 1440p till
the 970 and 390 dropped below 60fps on
average while the minimum was just above
40 fps there was surprisingly little
difference between the gtx 970 and gtx
980 and the jump from the GTX 980 to the
fury it was quite noticeable that 16%
increase in minimum frame rate really
made a big difference as is often the
case we find the 4k work why more than
one GPU to deliver perfectly smooth
gameplay with all the eye candy turned
up here a single 980ti was good for just
36 FPS while the framerate did drop as
low as 29 FPS we found the call of duty
black ops 3 is one of those games that
really requires at least an average of
60 frames per second and in fact if you
can keep the minimum frame rate above 60
frames then the gameplay is very well
once the average frame rate drops to
around 40 fps you really start to notice
the frame rate lag that said at 1080p we
were able to achieve exceptional
performance with the GTX 970 and r9 390
it's both rendered more than the 60
frames per second minimum jumping to
1440p so all graphics cards tested
suffer a pretty drastic frame rate here
the 970 and 390 for example dropped to a
40 frame minimum with
around 50 yes at this Raz the AMD Perry
graphics cards all the 980ti really
required for perfectly smooth gameplay
finally at 4k the game looked amazing
but was extremely demanding on the GPU
the geforce gtx 980ti for example dip
below 30 FPS at times and only managed
now average of 36 frames per second this
isn't unplayable but it certainly
wouldn't be acceptable in competitive
multiplayer scenarios for those of you
wondering I briefly looked at CPU
performance and found that the core i7
Sandy Bridge through the skylight
processes deliver the best results while
the core i5s and quad core AMD FX ranges
are far behind the AMD FX 8350 for
example saw over 70% utilization across
all eight threads while the core i7 6 to
700 K only saw around 45% utilization as
always we'll be posting these graphs and
a text summary up to our forum a
hardwarian box comm if you've got any
questions at all then please let me know
in the comments and for more videos like
this hit like hit subscribe and I'll see
you guys next time
