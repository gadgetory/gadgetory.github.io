hand today I have Intel's new pentium g
4560 processor i've got the little guy
here and this is a kb lake cpu featuring
two cores but interestingly it has
hyper-threading support so there are
four threads and while that essentially
makes it a core i3 processor which is a
little confusing since we have core i3
tabulated processors anyway it does come
clocked at 3.5 gigahertz so that means
it's only 200 megahertz slower than the
much-loved core i3 6100 and that
technically means it can't be more than
five percent slower that's amazing news
for budget shoppers who had their eye on
something like the i3 6100 because the
g40 560 costs just $72 u.s. 478 dollars
of you that's almost half the price of
the i3 6100 down under a 48 percent
discount for us of these anyway at this
point it's pretty clear that the g 45 60
is going to be a great budget processor
and I do have a big benchmark video
coming up next week to prove that today
I'm looking at something else and while
there will be a few benchmarks that's
not the main focus of this video if you
haven't heard intel's kb lake processors
do not support Windows 7 or 8.1 at least
not officially so because of this it's
caused a healer's confusion and when I
announced I had AG 45 on hand for
testing the most commonly asked question
was could I test it using Windows 7
honestly I didn't plan to do this kb
lake is an x86 processor after all so of
course it's going to work with older and
alternative operating systems this is
obviously another Microsoft scare tactic
to try and get PC users to upgrade to
Windows 10 what really surprised me was
when I bought this chip at a local store
I won't name the retailer but they are
very large in Australia and have stores
in most states what surprised me was the
salesman serving me stressed that I must
use Windows 10 with this processor and
that I would have a lot of trouble with
Windows 8 or older operating systems
there was a long line behind me and I
didn't really want to be that guy so I
didn't grill him as to why this was I
also knew that what he was saying
technically wasn't incorrect I was just
surprised he was passing on the
Microsoft slash Intel message so
passionately so here are a few facts we
know
seven will continue to receive updates
until 2020 windows 8 will receive
updates until 2023 currently these
versions of Windows are running
perfectly fine on skylight processes and
yet for some reason Microsoft is
discontinuing support for skylight
processes on July 17th 2017 basically
this means beyond that point Microsoft
will not ensure that future updates are
compatible with skylight and now Kb Lake
processes so stability and reliability
could become an issue in the future
which is why Intel isn't announcing
support for these older operating
systems the only possible cable 8
feature that I know of that might
require operating support for maximum
efficiency is intel's new speed shift
technology that makes it possible to
change power States more quickly than
skylake still I'm not sure budget users
seeking the gee 45 60 for example will
really care about this issue anyway in
an effort to address the commonly asked
question does the pentium g 45 60 work
with Windows 7 well let's take a look
first up I ran the Cinebench r15
multi-threaded CPU benchmark to
establish a baseline under Windows 10
the G 45 60 scores 377 points and this
score was confirmed by three separate
runs meanwhile using the older Windows 7
operating system the best score we saw
was 254 points and that's a 6 percent
performance here this isn't necessarily
down to the lack of official kb lake
support but rather the fact that Windows
7 is now an 8-year old operating system
moving to another synthetic benchmark
iran's 3dmark firestrike and here the g
45 60 in conjunction with the geforce
gtx 1060 scored nine thousand 102 points
which was less than two percent slower
than the nine thousand two hundred and
forty four point score that we saw under
Windows 10 after that it was time for
some games Deus Ex mankind divided was
testing using DirectX 11 since Windows 7
doesn't support DirectX 12 the
performance was identical on both
operating systems and I found after
looking at a number of games that the
performance only varied by one to two
frames a second which is margin of error
stuff finally I also quickly looked at
power consumption and using the exact
same test system we found that Windows 7
and Windows 10 provided the exact same
power draw again there were just a few
watts in it so safe to say it was within
the margin of error
throughout my testing I didn't run into
any issues with Windows 7 at all
stability was excellent that said it has
been a long time since I've revisited
this old operating system and I'm
personally happy to leave it in the past
just setting up the system was a huge
pain obviously most won't be installing
the Windows 7 operating system on a 200
series motherboard so the issues I ran
into should be fairly isolated for
example upon installing Windows 7 I
could only use the ps2 port on my z 270
board which wasn't particularly useful
since I had no network connection and
none of the USB ports worked the
quickest solution for me was to throw
the driving an older system that
featured USB 2.0 ports and copy the
drivers over that way for whatever
reason the USB 2.0 header on my z 270
board didn't work until the system
drivers were installed
anyway I personally don't have an issue
with Windows 10 and I'm more than happy
to have it still that's not the point
here if you have a strict budget or
simply don't want to buy a new software
just yet it appears you don't have to
the G 4560 works perfectly fine with
Windows 7 performance was down in a few
areas but that was to be expected after
all Windows 7 was replaced by Windows 8
four years ago now so for all of you
guys asking me if the pentium g 45 60
can run Windows 7 you should have your
answer now with that I will get back to
benchmarking the G 45 60 properly
against some modern core i3 Core i5 and
core i7 processors in a bunch of
different games with a few different
graphics cards and resolutions and I
should have those results ready for you
guys
pretty soon anyway that's all for this
one I'm your host Steve and I'll catch
you on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
