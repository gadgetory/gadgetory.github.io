unboxed earlier on this channel you
might have seen my review of the Auris
gtx 1070 gaming box which provides the
power of a fully fledged desktop
graphics card to a laptop or other PC
through Thunderbolt 3 if you haven't
checked out my thoughts on the unit yet
we'll put some links around the play so
you can check it out but my main point
in that video is that this external
graphics box does have the capability to
turn a low-power device like an
ultraportable
into a genuine gaming machine while the
gaming box was capable of playing modern
games and good framerate and detail
levels I did have a few issues with the
overall experience the biggest wasn't
due to the gaming box at all but due to
the laptop I connected it to the Lenovo
ThinkPad x1 carbon I tested with had
just an Intel Core i5 7200 u inside a
dual core process of slower than the
pentium g 4560 we recommend for budget
gaming builds this CPU is simply too
slow to keep up with the power of the
gtx 1070 in the gaming box often leading
to a cpu bottleneck the cpu bottleneck
caused a few problems firstly I noticed
some frame pacing issues in a couple of
games like The Witcher 3 which led to
consistent stutters despite an average
frame rate that pushed well above 50 fps
in this game the CPU was consistently
pegged at 100% utilization while the GPU
was often underutilized the CPU
bottleneck also appeared to reduce the
performance relative to what we normally
see from a gtx 1070 games err would
normally be playable at 1440p ultra
detailed settings on a gtx 1070 were
only playable at 1080p on the gaming box
due to these bottlenecks in this video
I'll be exploring the impact of these
bottlenecks further and comparing the
gtx 1070 gaming box to a true gaming
laptop with the gtx 1070 inside so
before I jump into the numbers let's
talk about the test setup and put the
gtx 1070 gaming box connected to the
ThinkPad x1 card through my usual suite
of gaming laptop benchmarks and compared
it to a number of other laptops i've
tested over the last year
I'll primarily be discussing the gaming
box up against new soos ROG gl 502 vs
which is a gtx 1070 laptop with a 1080p
display and a quad-core intel core i7
7700 HQ inside in other words the cpu is
much more powerful but the GPU is
largely the same you'll see some results
from other laptops in the charts as well
I'm going to start by looking at 3d
marks times by benchmark which is the
most GPU intensive 3d mark workload here
we can see an overall score from the GTX
970 gaming box system there's just 17
percent higher than the GTX 1060 gaming
laptop but it falls 21% behind the GTX
970 powered GL 502 vs normally a gtx
1070 system would be about 48 percent
faster than gtx 1060 system in time spy
so it's clear the gtx 1070 gaming box is
being limited by the slower CPU in the
laptop i was testing with moving to
games now and starting with some older
titles the tomb raider was one of the
best performing games on the gtx 1070
gaming box falling just 2% behind a GTX
970 laptop one-percent low frame rates
couldn't match the gtx 1070 though at 42
FPS we're seeing roughly the same
minimum results as a gtx 1060 laptop
however the gaming box struggled with
Metro last light falling 40% behind a
GTX 10 serving laptop and recording a
sub 30fps one percent low result this
results place the ultra portable set up
below a GTX 1060 laptop in terms of
performance which is a disappointing
result here BioShock Infinite
performance from the gaming box was
similar to a GTX 1060 laptop but those
24% behind a GTX 970 laptop the game was
very smooth to play but unfortunately
our capture tools didn't work properly
in this title so I don't have any frame
rate data Middle Earth shadow of Mordor
is another game where the GTX 1070
gaming box Falls closer to GTX 1060
performance are performing some 1060
laptops but falling 24% behind the GL
502 vs
1% low data was consistent with the GTX
1060 experience in this title
Grand Theft Auto 5 is another title
where the game Reeboks are closer to gtx
1060 laptops again falling 29% behind
the gel 502 vs stuttering
and Texas streaming issues were present
in this game with 1% lower result of 36
FPS lower than 10 60 laptops game work
settings really tax the gtx 1070 gaming
box playing batman arkham knight but the
game is actually very playable with
these settings disabled in any case our
test users game works and here the game
you box is a good 41% slower than the
gel 502 vs its minimum FPS results are
awful as well falling around the 23 FPS
mark which is unacceptable turnoff game
works and this improves massively rise
of the Tomb Raider is a very GPU
intensive title at maximum settings so
here we're seeing the gaming box fall
closer to gtx 1070 performance than gtx
1060 here it's 18% slower than our 1070
gaming laptop with a similar reduction
in 1% low performance move to high
detail settings and rise of the Tomb
Raider Falls much closer to the gtx 1060
but with poor 1% lower results which is
disappointing Deus Ex mankind divided is
a title where the gaming box performs
better than a 1060 laptop in average
frame rates but is roughly equivalent
when looking at 1% low results we're
looking at a 24% lower average FPS than
a gtx 1070 laptop here hitman and this
is a big surprise he actually runs
awfully on the timing box using DirectX
12 and oxford details with a 1% low
under 20 FPS much slower than even a GTX
1060 laptop the game is pretty much
unplayable with these sorts of results
unless you use lower quality settings
civilization 6 is another game that
suffers from the CPU bottleneck the
gaming box it does achieve an average
framerate above 30 FPS but it's 1% low
is sub 30 which is not the case with GTX
260 laptops not a huge surprise here
considering even in GTX 10 7 laptop
isn't much better than 1060 laptop in
terms of minimum frame rate in this game
it's pretty much CPU bottlenecked
watchdogs to continues the trend of CPU
intensive titles and the gaming box
struggles at ultra detail settings with
a sub 20 fps 1% low that falls well
behind 1060 laptops the game isn't much
more playable at medium quality settings
still producing a sub 31 percent low
wear GTX 10 6
laptops are well into the 40s here at
1080p you want a true gaming laptop with
the gtx 1070 inside to play this game in
all its glory
Mass Effect Andromeda is the last title
I tested with and the section I tested
with inside The Tempest is surprisingly
demanding the ultra portable struggles
to stream data during the run and as
such falls massively behind gtx 1060
laptops with the 1% low in the 20s
while gtx 1060 laptops push this into
the 30 FPS range of ultra detail
settings the experience on actual
planets is much better but the templates
punishes the slow cpu and limited
bandwidth over syrup here
the end result here is that the gtx 1070
gaming box connected to an ultra
portable with a dual-core CPU mostly
acts like a gtx 1060 gaming laptop
rather than a more powerful gtx 1070
machine in some cases like watchdogs -
the system actually performs
significantly worse than a gtx 1060
machine due to the severe cpu bottleneck
and other tiles like rise of the Tomb
Raider the gaming box was closer to a
gtx 1070 system for those looking to use
a thunderbolt through GPU like the horas
gaming box here with an ultraportable
it's clear that you won't be getting the
same experience as an actual gtx 1070
gaming laptop the Zeus GL 502 vs was 30
to 50 percent faster for the most part
and that's almost entirely down to the
fastest CPU inside actual gaming laptops
despite the lower performers provided by
the gaming box there are still
advantages to using this type of setup
with an ultra portable / purchasing a
true gaming laptop Ultra portables as
the name suggests are far more portable
than even the slimmest and lightest
gaming laptops available including
invidious new max-q stuff my ThinkPad x1
carbon is just 1.1 kilograms heavy and
16 millimeters thick while max-q gtx
1070 laptops were more like 1.9
kilograms heavy and 19 millimeters thick
those that don't want to carry around
the extra bulk of a gaming laptop are
better off buying an ultra portable
along with an external graphics dock
when you're out and about you're only
carrying around the slimming light
laptop but when you return home to your
desk you can plug the system into an
external graphics box to try
form it into a gaming machine there are
still some issues to iron out with this
sort of thing I think driver tweaks
could improve frame pacing and of course
faster 15 what CPUs in the future would
be nice but it's a good start for a
relatively immature product category
anyway I hope you guys learned something
from a look at the Auris gtx 1070 gaming
box up against the true gtx 1070 gaming
laptop if you're interested in any of
the products we were talking about
you'll find links to that in the
