should hopefully be a short one but
still an interesting one for those out
there that are either currently gave me
on an HDR display or a thinking of
upgrading to an HDR display in the near
future so you might remember a few weeks
ago I looked into the performance
differences between HDR and SDR gaming
on graphics cards using invidious Pascal
architecture using a Titan xpath scale I
found that simply enabling HDR resulted
in a 4% hit to performance on average
across a handful of titles while
enabling g-sync HDR tanked performance
by a pretty significant 12% average not
all games saw this performance it were
enabling HDR but certainly enough of
them did to cause concern for HDR gamers
in that video I suggested the
performance it was judaism driver-side
work that was needed to send out HDR and
specifically g-sync HDR signals through
Pascal's display engine with the amount
of work varying depending on the game
and its HDR implementation well today
there's a new Nvidia graphics
architecture in town in the form of
cheering we've already talked a lot
about the performance of Troon GPUs in
our previous reviews of the r-tx 2080
and our TX 20 atti but one thing we
didn't really touch on was the
improvements in video made to the
display engine one of the key changes is
the inclusion of a native HDR pipeline
this essentially means that what in
video is previously doing in software
through drivers can now be done natively
in hardware on cheering bass cards tone
mapping in particular is one aspect of
HDR that you can now do natively and
this theoretically should resolve the
HDR performance issues we saw with
Pascal and I'll get onto that in a
moment the other key new feature of
chewings display engine is support for
DisplayPort 1.4 a with DSC or display
stream compression DSC is a VESA
standard that provides in their words
visually lossless compression enabling
support for higher resolutions and
refresh rates without chroma subsampling
previous Pascal cards were limited to 4k
HDR at 98 Hertz or 8k at just 30 Hertz
through a single cable while
during with DSC support can now output
4k HDR at 144 Hertz with that sub simply
an 8k at 60 Hertz through a single cable
that doesn't mean today's 4k 144 Hertz
HDR displace like the Acer predator X 27
will be able to run at 144 Hertz with
that chroma subsampling with the
cheering GPU for DSC to work it needs to
be supported on both ends of the display
cable
so both the GPU and monitor itself need
to support the technology and in the
case of these current 4k 144 Hertz
monitors the monitor does not support
DSC but it does mean that we now have
GPUs capable of running displays at 4k
144 Hertz and 8k 60 Hertz so one side of
that equation is ready now it's up to
monitor manufacturers release new
displays that integrate support for DSC
I mean full 4k 144 Hertz with HDR in all
its glory I did say to my review of the
predator X 27 and a sous PG 27 UQ the
buyers of this panel might feel a bit
burned when many of the early adopter
issues are fixed in a second generation
of the product and the subsampling issue
seems to be one will be fixed relatively
quickly anyway back to HDR in v8 claims
we shouldn't be seeing any performance
it with HDR enabled compared to SDR so
let's put that to the test using the
GeForce r-tx 20 80 TI founders Edition
and the exact same system I used
previously my personal rising 7 1718
ring and of course the Acer predator X
27 g-sync HDR display as the monitor in
hand let's first take a look at some of
the games that were most impacted by HD
our processing with Pascal graphics
cards in Middle Earth shadow of war
enabling HDR on a pascal card resulted
in a 5% hit to performance and enabling
chasing HDR saw a massive drop of 14%
however with cheering that performance
job is eradicated there's only a 1 FPS
difference between SDR gaming and
chasing HDR gaming and that's basically
within the margin of error Star Wars
Battlefront 2 was another game heavily
impacted by HD are seeing drops of 5%
with HDR enabled and 13% with Qi sink
HDR enables however on the RT X 20 80 TI
there is essentially no difference
between HDR and SDR performance and
these results carry over to
battlefield one which uses the same
engine and had nearly the same
performance issues with Pascal no such
problems with cheering in assassin
Street origins again we saw up to an 11
percent performance drop with Jason HG
are enabled with cheering I did see a
slight dip and performance switching on
HDR but now we're talking about just you
know one to two FPS or three percent
performance it as opposed to 11 percent
hitman wasn't as impacted by HD our own
Pascal just a four to six percent
performance drop but again on the twenty
atti that deficit has been erased
entirely a couple of games did see no
performers hit with HDR or g-sync HDR
enabled on Pascal those were far cry 5
and the new shadow of the Tomb Raider
which I went back and tested for this
video unsurprisingly these titles also
saw no HDR performance impact on
cheering cards so in the case of the new
display engine insuring what NVIDIA has
claimed is absolutely the truth the new
HDR pipeline completely resolves the
issue of worst performance with HDR
enables compared to SDR that's great
news for those currently gaming on HDR
displays but also for the future as HCl
will no doubt become much more
widespread in the next few years
trees new HDR pipeline is also white in
video decided to benchmark games using
HDR for their early comparisons between
the r-tx 2080 and GTX 1080
you might remember this famous slide
from before launch where Nvidia tested
games like shadow of war and Mass Effect
Andromeda using HDR showing impressive
performance gains between the 2080 and
1080 I speculated at the time that
Nvidia did this because cheering had no
HDR performance drop which makes truing
look that little bit faster than Pascal
despite most gamers being more
interested in regular STR performance
where the margins would be narrower and
it looks like that was the correct
assumption to make going on what we know
now the other question you might be
wondering is should I buy a cheering
card over a Pascal card if I'm gaming on
an HDR display for example should you
buy an RT X 20 80 over a GTX 1080 Ti as
we know in SDR games the RT X 20 80
delivers almost the exact same
performance as the GTX 10 80 TI yet it
costs around 100 to 150 US dollars more
so
20 percent more for the same performance
as Steve seventies review the 20 80 only
really makes sense at the AIB MSRP but
no 20 80 you can buy right now is even
close to that price making it poor value
for STI gamers but for HDR gamers we're
seeing a situation where HDR games are
12% slower on the 1080 Ti compared to
the 20 80 purely thanks to Pascal's
non-native HDR pipeline that changes the
equation someone the 1080 Ti is around
17 percent cheaper but in these HDR
games is also 12 percent slower that
doesn't make the 20 ATVs stand out value
option but it does close the margin
someone compared to regular SDR gaming
the issue though is that this comparison
only holds true for the handful of
titles that are affected by HDR on
Pascal there are some games like shadow
of the Tomb Raider they're run perfectly
fine in the HDR mode on Pascal with no
performance drop there are also still a
lot of games that don't support HDR at
all so if you plan on playing any of
those on a 2080 the value proposition
just gets worse and worse so my advice
for hgr game is thinking of upgrading to
something like the 2080
you're still to just get the 10 atti as
despite trying this new HDR pipeline the
1080 Ti is better value going on current
prices that's it for this revisit of HDR
performance with truing cards in hand if
you haven't already seen our 35 game
benchmark of the 2080 and 28 ETA go back
and take a look at that because it's
pretty comprehensive to say the least
subscribe for more graphics card
coverage consider supporting us on
patreon so that we can afford to
benchmark 35 games with the next GPU
release and I'll catch you in the next
one
