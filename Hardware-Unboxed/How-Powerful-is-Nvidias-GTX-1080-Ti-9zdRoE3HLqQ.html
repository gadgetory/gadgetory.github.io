upcoming GeForce GTX 1080 T are leaked
and they looks like the real deal in
this video I'm gonna take a look at the
specs discuss them and then provide a
few theoretical benchmarks so far the
evidence suggests that in video could be
preparing the 1080 Ti for launch at the
Consumer Electronics Show or CES for
short in January 2017 this means a three
to four month wait and that means the
1080 TR will be landing roughly eight
months after the vanilla 1080 although
this seems like a delay it really isn't
the 980ti followed the standard 980
after roughly the same period of time
this will give him video some time to
produce more Titan xgp 102 chips as this
is the silicon the 1080 TI will be based
on the Titan X features just two sm
units disabled for a total of 28
enabling a mind-blowing 3584 CUDA caused
the 1080 Ti is expected to have another
2 SM units disabled for 3328 CUDA cores
and 208 M use that's only a 7% reduction
in cause from the $1200 GPU and still
30% more than the already very awesome
GTX 1080 for those of you wondering the
fully enabled GP 102 features 30 SM
units for 3840 CUDA cores and this
version is used by the Quadro p6000 you
probably have to sell your car or a
kidney in to afford one of those so
let's get back to the game with South
shall we out of the box the 1080 TI
should operate at a base clock at 1503
megahertz which is roughly the same base
frequency of the GTX 1070 and 1062 boost
clock looks to be set at 1623 megahertz
which is almost 100 megahertz higher
than the tight next but 100 megahertz
lower than the 1080 of course each
frequencies mean very little given how
GPU boost 3.0 works you can expect Boyd
partner card versions the 1080 T is the
those that feed at the optimal amount of
power while keeping it cool should see
their version sustained over a 2
gigahertz frequency at all times there
has been some controversy surrounding
the memory as the leaked info from and
video suggests gddr5 memory will be used
rather than gddr5 X this is further
confirmed by the eight gigabit per
second bandwidth suggesting a base
frequency of just two gigahertz and
the 2.5 gigahertz the gddr5 X memory of
the ght X 1080 operates up it seems a
little crazy and rather unlikely that
the faster 1080 T I'll be paired with
slower memory however if you delve a
little deeper into the specs it starts
to make sense because the 1080 Ti is
using the GPU 102 architecture features
a 384 bit wired memory bus while the
1080 was limited to a 256 bit bus this
means despite being lower clock gddr5
memory the 1080 Ti will have a
theoretical bandwidth of 384 gigabytes
per second a 20% greater bandwidth when
compared to the 1080 not only that but
the 1080 Ti is expected to receive a
massive 12 gigabyte memory buffer so
performance wise how will the 3328
critical 384 gigabyte per second Pasco
GPU look like from the current lineup
realistically the 1080 TI's should be a
good bit faster than the standard 1080
and not a great deal slower than type
next I'm expecting on average the 1080
TI will be 30% faster than the 1080 and
just 7% slower than the type next it
really goes without saying but I will
say it anyway take these results with a
grain of salt
they're completely fabricated based on
where I think the performance will be
according to the leaks specifications
for the gtx 980ti so looking at my
estimator witcher 3 results it looks
like the 1080 TI could be almost as fast
as a pair of gtx 1070 sli graphics cards
are 4k the 1080 TI should also be a true
4k contender as we see almost a 60 FPS
average with the game max down adding a
second card for sli should push the
average frame rate to around 90 fps the
margins look much the same in rise of
the Tomb Raider the 1080 T I should fall
just short of the 1070 SLI cards while
in SLI pushing well over 100 FPS should
be possible if the 1080 Ti does arrive
next year with the leaked specs I'll be
very keen to see just how close my
estimates were it's not rocket science
so we should be pretty well on the money
here given the specifications the GC X
1080 Ti would naturally be an expensive
graphics card especially considering the
GTX 1080 currently retails for 630
dollars with a $600 MSRP there's no word
on exact pricing just yet but it should
end up costing seven eight hundred
dollars the Titan X which is in videos
most powerful graphics card already
retails for a what
1,200 between now and CES 2017 and
videos expected to launch the gcf's 1050
and for new report is correct the GTX
1050 Ti both graphics cards will slot
beneath the $200 GTX 1063 gigabyte and
videos mid-range and entry-level lineup
the gtx 750ti will reportedly packs 768
cuda cores
well the GTX 1050 will use 640 down from
the 1280 cores than the GTX 1060
also on the cards we know that AMD is
preparing Vega 10 for release and
consequently it should be arriving
around the same time as the GC X 1080 Ti
so to be interesting to see how the RX 4
known to your Arabs fury or whatever we
will end up calling it handles the 1080i
make no mistake Vega is going to be a
beast as all indications suggest 4096
cores clocked at a respectable speed and
16 gigabytes at HBM to memory so it
seems the GPU wars just stallion heat up
stay tuned guys 2017 is gonna be
exciting cheers guys for joining me for
another episode of hardware unbox so
those of you that already support the
channel thank you so much it's truly
appreciated and to those of you that
would like to support the channel
directly I do have Amazon links and a
patreon link in the video description
below thanks a lot and I'll see you guys
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
