upcoming geforce gtx 1080 ti leaked and
they looked like the real deal in this
video I'm going to take a look at the
specs discuss them and then provide a
few theoretical benchmarks so far the
evidence suggests that in video could be
preparing the 1080 ti for launch at the
consumer electronics show CES for short
in January 2017 this means a three to
four month wait and that means that natt
I'll be landing roughly eight months
after the vanilla 1080 although this
seems like a delay it really isn't the
980 I followed the standard 980 after
roughly the same period of time this
will give him video some time to produce
more tight next gp100 two chips as this
the silicon the 1080 ti be based on the
tight next features just to sm units
disabled for a total of 28 enabling a
mind-blowing 3584 cuda cores the 1080 TI
is expected to have another two sm units
disabled for 3328 cuda cores and 208 m
use that's only a seven percent
reduction in cause from the 1200 GPU
instill thirty percent more than the
already very awesome GTX 1080 for those
of you wondering the fully enabled GP
102 features 30 sm units for 3840 cuda
cores and this version is used by the
quadro p6000 you probably have to sell
your car or a kidney in to afford one of
those so let's get back to the game with
South shall we out of the box the 1080
TI should operate at a base clock in
1503 megahertz which is roughly the same
base frequency of the GTX 1070 and 1060
the boost clock looks to be set at 16 23
megahertz which is almost a hundred
megahertz higher than the tight next but
100 megahertz lower than the 1080 of
course each frequencies mean very little
given how GPU boost 3-pointer works you
can expect boy partner card versions the
1080 tis the those that feed at the
optimal amount of power while keeping it
cool should see their version sustained
over a 2 gigahertz frequency at all
times there has been some controversy
surrounding the memory is the leaked
info from and video suggests gddr5
memory will be used rather than gddr5 x
this is further confirmed by the eight
gigabit per second bandwidth suggesting
a base frequency of just two gigahertz
and
the 2.5 gigahertz the gddr5 x memory of
the gtx 1080 operates up it seems a
little crazy and rather unlikely that
the faster 1080 TI will be paired with
slower memory however if you delve a
little deeper into the specs it starts
to make sense because the 1080 TI is
using the GV 102 architecture features a
384-bit wired memory bus well the 1080
was limited to a 256-bit bus this means
despite being lower clock gddr5 memory
the 1080 TI will have a theoretical
bandwidth of 384 gigabytes per second a
20-percent greater bandwidth when
compared to the 1080 not only that but
the 1080 TI is expected to receive a
massive 12 gigabyte memory buffer so
performance wise how will the 3328
critical 384 gigabyte per second pascal
GPU look life in the current lineup
realistically the 1080 TI's should be a
good bit faster than the standard 1080
and not a great deal slower than tight
next I'm expecting on average to the
1080 TI will be thirty percent faster
than the 1080 and just seven percent
slower than the type next it really goes
without saying but I will say it anyway
take these results with a grain of salt
they're completely fabricated based on
where I think the performance will be
according to the leaked specifications
for the GTX 1080 TI so looking at my
estimator witcher 3 results it looks
like the 10 ATT i could be almost as
fast as a pair of gtx 1070 sli graphics
cards are 4k the 10 attr should also be
a true 4k contender as we see almost a
60 FPS average with the game max down
adding a second card for sli should push
the average frame rate to around 90 FPS
the margins look much the same in rise
of the Tomb Raider the 1080p I should
fall just short of the 1070 SLI cards
while in sli pushing well over 100 FPS
should be possible if the 1080 TI does
arrive next year with the leaked specs
i'll be very keen to see just how close
my estimates were it's not rocket
science so we should be pretty well on
the money here given the specifications
the gtx 1080 TI will naturally be an
expensive graphics card especially
considering the gtx 1080 currently
retails for 600 thirty dollars with a
six-hundred-dollar MSRP there's no word
on exact pricing just yet but it should
end up costing seven eight hundred
dollars the time next which is in videos
most powerful graphics card already be
tails for what
1200 between now and CES 2017 and videos
expected to launch the GC x 1050 and for
new report is correct the GTX 1050 ti
both graphics cards will slip beneath
the two-hundred-dollar GTX 1063 gigabyte
in and videos mid-range and entry-level
lineup the gtx 750ti will reportedly
pack 768 cuticles well the GTX 1050 will
use 640 down from the 1280 cores in the
GTX 1060 also on the cards we know that
AMD is preparing Vega 10 for a lease and
consequently it should be arriving
around the same time as the GC x 1080 TI
so to be interesting to see how the RX
for known to your arabs fury or whatever
we will end up calling it handles the
1080i make no mistake Vega is going to
be a beast as all indications suggest
4096 cores clocked at a respectable
speed and 16 gigabytes at HP m2 memory
so it seems the GPU Wars just stallion
heat up stay tuned guys 2017 is going to
be exciting cheers guys for joining me
for another episode hardware on box to
those of you that already support the
channel thank you so much it's truly
appreciated and to those of you that
would like to support the channel
directly i do have amazon links and a
patron link in the video description
below thanks a lot and i'll see you guys
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
