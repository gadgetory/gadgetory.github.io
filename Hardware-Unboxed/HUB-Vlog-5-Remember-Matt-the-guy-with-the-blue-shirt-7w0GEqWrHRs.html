today I'll be revealing those of a good
detail
hey Matt yeah everyone Matt's here today
we're not doing Vega details today
instead we finally have Matt here to
explain what's going on and what his
plans are for the channel and I think
life in general as you can see his knees
mostly better now he's getting around
not as quick as he once was but he's
getting ready
so anyway metal handed over to you and
hey guys one important matter to get out
of the way today is the official
retirement of the blue shirt evolution
and it's a new chapter yeah times are
changing a hammer unboxed so we'll be
hanging this one in the rafters
yeah so what's been happening with me
well I got my knee surgery and honestly
I'm doing good like pretty much a week
afterwards I was off crutches and stuff
walking around and now I'm pretty much
walking around
like it never happened can't run or do
any sort of exercise or anything on it
but yeah that's the status of that with
the channel I guess it's kind of related
more than my personal life I have owned
a gym for the last couple of years and
I've been trying to sell it for the best
part of 7 months it's been a bit of a
nightmare but during that time most of
that time I was able to spend you know a
lot of my time and hardware I'm boxed
now it should finally be going through
on Monday the sale that is but it also
means that that income stream will be
disappearing basically so I've been
trying to start a new business it's
going pretty well but that's really been
taking up all of my time so I've had a
lot less time to dedicate to the channel
and yet Steve's kind of stepped in and
it's been doing a really goddamn good
job no thanks yeah so as I sort of
suggested I think it was video just last
week I will be continuing off the
channel keeping it alive and kicking
indefinitely
and hopefully at some stage we can have
Matt return but there's no definite
plans yet because as matt said he's got
a lot of things to work out
and the channel takes up a massive truly
massive amount of time and at this point
with the size of the channel is it
doesn't really make money especially if
the money that Matt and I have both
spent on camera equipment lighting even
Hardware for testing we don't get all of
that for free so yeah it's been a costly
endeavor but we both do it because we
love it and I love all the benchmarking
about so that's why you will continue to
see all that sort of stuff
so as matt said you know back when the
channel started I think it was probably
about a year and a half ago near April
okay yeah yeah so back then when Matt
started the channel sort of like Matt
and I sort of started see it together
that's probably a bit more Matt it was
Matt was definitely the driving force
and motivation behind
however unboxed because I was already
testing you know and doing written
reviews on products Matt was really came
to do some sort of video thing and we've
been friends for a long time and Matt's
into the tech stuff more the gadgets and
peripherals and laptops all that kind of
stuff and definitely gaming Matt wanted
to do video reviews and I just had no
interest whatsoever in doing video
reviews I can't really tell you why I
just
yeah the motivation wasn't there so I
don't like doing things I'm not
motivated to do and Matt hounded me for
weeks and weeks on end about to start
this YouTube channel I said now and are
not interested and then I said to Matt
well if you want to do it I'll help you
I'll you know I've got the camera we can
film some videos and that and Matt was
you sort of enjoyed unboxing type videos
like a little bit and I was actually
initially inspired to do this channel
hearing Liu from unbox therapy on the
Joe Rogan experience I was like that's
my goal so yeah it's sort of the name
Hardware unboxed so it was sort of to be
an unboxing PC hardware stuff so
motherboards grabbers cards and also
your gadgets and phones than that and
yeah which didn't really interest me but
that's that was sort of the idea and I
help with the filming and stuff to get
Matt started and I think you know we did
a couple of videos and you were just
like yeah yeah this is uninspiring -
unboxing yeah it's like this is just
junk onto Hardware unboxed
I'm your host Matt and today we're gonna
be taking a look at the Cougar 500k
gaming keyboard as it is a gaming
keyboard it does have five programmable
keys down the left side and the six
programmable key is actually split
spacebar the keyboard also has onboard
memory it was just the same repetitive
thing over and over again and yeah just
unboxing PC hardware I don't think there
was enough diversity there for it to be
interesting so yeah Matt sort of said
you know how about we do some more
in-depth benchmarks sort of stuff and
you know I'll help you with the
benchmark so it doesn't take tapes of
your time and that's sort of how the
channels become what it is today
yeah so even though Steve seems knew is
in there yeah I've been there
running benchmark after benchmarks and
recording results and yeah help him out
with his scripts and yeah and then when
Matt went to his knee surgery the plan
was never for me to jump in front of the
camera as I said I wasn't really
interested but as powerbox developed and
grew over the last year and a half or
whatever it's been I started to really
fall in love with it get sucked into the
movie or the video rather content
creation stuff just really enjoyed that
all the editing process the filming
creating the b-roll was all really cool
and then when Matt went further it was
supposed to be we sort of budgeted six
weeks off and then Matt's gym stuff all
happened while he was having knee
surgery which was terrible timing for
Matt and it looked like the channel was
sort of gonna fall apart a bit and I
didn't really want that to happen with
all the time that we've both put into it
so I just said to Matt well I'm gonna
have to I think was there gtx 1050
release wasn't it slightly just before
that I think the GTX 1050 news we were
we were given the news under embargo and
Matt wasn't available Tom so I said well
I'm gonna give it a go see how we go did
that went quite well and then we ended
up with the 1050 and the 1050 TR and I
think you took on the 1050 yeah
I did the TI and since then I've just
been making videos
so anyway wrapping it up like I said the
channel will go on we want to keep
growing the channel you know making it
the content as good as possible so we'll
keep putting tons of time and effort
into that we don't be slacking off there
but going forward in well I suppose them
the meantime it'll be me creating the
videos and then Maps aim is to get back
to the channel it's just we don't know
when so it could be a month it could be
a year well it's probably gonna be a
couple of months at the earliest by the
sounds but at some stage you know Matt
will come back in a more full time role
we hope but if not I'm sure I can snag
you now and then for the odd video and
for sure we're gonna do an unboxing
video next
that's the series Matt started and I've
taken over and there's a sort of like as
I always say it's the real hardware box
fans that enjoy that series yes I will
be giving you a duo unboxings that
should be interesting yeah got a couple
of boxes to do so yeah anything else you
want to say um not really I suppose yeah
no exactly short the future will hold
but one way or another they'll be
awesome content here so stay tuned cool
as always Matt Davis now so you guys
like that who do the Sony's look cool or
hang around skies may or Matt they
really suit me I think they're a bit
small for my head they III must have a
big head I thought I'd be good
so I'd benchmarking knowledge</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
