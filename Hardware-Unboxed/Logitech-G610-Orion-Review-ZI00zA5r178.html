romaji mechanical switches of late I've
reviewed them on the g8 10 most recently
I'm a fan of the Roma G's however
overall the variety and quality of the
Cherry MX switches remains unparalleled
knowing this logitech's latest
mechanical installment includes the
industry standard again non hand have
Logitech's new g6 10 featuring Cherry MX
brown switches speaking of the g8 10 you
can be excused for mistake in the tube
they share an identical footprint and
the only face-up difference is
detectable only once you plug the
keyboard in while the g8 10 features
full RGB lighting the g6 10 is
illuminated with white only LEDs
underneath the keys the switches of
Cherry MX as mentioned meaning the
lights it just above the switch
unlike the Roma G's that cleverly
include them in the middle of the switch
for more consistent lighting across the
whole key wedge notably on keys with
multiple functions such as the number
keys this keyboard has a standard key
layout with additional media controls a
wide volume wheel as well as windows
lock key and lighting brightness toggle
there's no additional macro keys and
this helps keep the overall footprint of
the keyboard quite small there aren't
really a lot of mechanical keyboards
that you could use in the office without
giving away the fact that you're a
gaming nerd but the g6 10 is definitely
an exception it's sleek and understated
with no flashy colors or crazy shapes
the keyboard is black all around with a
matte type
smudge resistant finish up top and the
glossy smooth finish around the sides
and back the underside features a grippy
diagonal line design 5 large rubber pads
to prevent any sliding on the desk and
then the flip down legs layer to choose
from a flat 4 degrees or an 8 degree
pitch which is definitely a nice touch
and something that would be simple and
inexpensive for other companies to
include on the bottom of their keyboards
I'm definitely a fan of the look and
overall design of g6 Tenergy 810 and the
small footprint is great too for gamers
on the go
performance-wise the g6 10 is great the
Cherry MX which has been proven again
and again so potential owners need to
have no hesitation in this regard
my g6 10 feature Terrier max Brown as
mentioned you can also get it in Cherry
MX Reds my personal favorite of the
Cherry MX blue
but it was actually quite nice to use a
slightly quieter keyboard for a change
the good old logitech gaming software is
used to customize the g6 10 but as you
might suspect there aren't a ton of
options on the keyboard the lighting can
be customized and there are some cool
presets such as wave breathing and
always-on are always off and you can
also specify certain keys to stay always
on or off to which some gamers like to
use to highlight specific sections such
as WASD with this software you can
record an aside macros to any key then
functions can also be assigned to the F
keys that run across the top of the
keyboard finally you can set up
different profiles and there's a game
mode that disables key combos that may
interrupt you gaming by accident
overall the G 6/10 is a straightforward
and solid entry from Logitech I thought
the G 8/10 was a nice change in terms of
its simplicity but the G 6/10 takes that
even further with its all-white
backlighting and return to Cherry MX
keys I would like to see availability
and all four of the comment area mexic a
top shion's and perhaps if sales start
well that's something you will see in
the future from Logitech coming into 120
US dollars the g6 10 is 40 dollars
cheaper than the G 810 so for those that
don't care for fancy RGB lighting prefer
Cherry MX switches to Logitech seroma
jeez it's absolutely perfect and great
value personally I'm still hoping for a
similarly sleek looking installment the
pictures of wrist rest RGB lighting and
USB pass-through before I consider
outing my daily driver whether it's
cherry MX Azure / G's I'm easy
both are honestly great to use thanks
for joining me for another mechanical
keyboard review
I'm your host man as always you can
check out the written version this
review and all our others on our website
at hardware on box comm have a great day
and I'll see you guys next time
