another build video for you today this
one is a pretty important one because
I'll be updating my test system with the
suite of new hardware to use for all
sorts of benchmarking in the future it's
obviously quite important to keep our
test systems up to date with the latest
hardware and this build will get me
ready for all the action that's to come
in 2019 so you might have seen on the
channel previously my core i7 8700 K
test rig which is my main Intel test
system and PC I use for game testing I
also have a rising system kitted out
with a arisin seven 2700 expert
considering the a 700 K is faster for
gaming it tends to get the first crack
at most major titles anyway this video
will serve a number of purposes firstly
you get to see a cool build process
which is always kind of neat but more
importantly it serves as a good
reference point so you guys can come
back and refresh yourself on what is in
my test system whenever we use it for
future benchmark videos we're also going
to see how this combination of
components we have here handles core I
nine ninety nine hundred K overclocking
because we know the chip is power hungry
and runs hot under full load and yes the
key component of this build is the core
a nine ninety nine hundred K which we'll
be replacing the crisis of an eighty
seven hundred K in the previous build we
still think the eighty seven hundred K
is better value for most people after a
high-end gaming system in a lot of games
it's just as fast as the nine hundred K
but costs one hundred and sixty dollars
less but there's no denying the 99
hundred K is the overall fastest
consumer desktop CPU on the market so
I'm upgrading to an in preparation for
next year in case you're wondering we
don't have retail packaging for the 99
hundred K here because the CPU is sent
to us by Intel and with engineering
samples or review samples this is how
they come packaged in this little sealed
black boxes so that's what you're
wondering
that is that is their ninety nine
hundred K right there four eighty seven
hundred K test system we used a gigabyte
Z 370 motherboard and this time around
we've gone with gigabyte once again the
companies really stepped up their game
with their Zed 390 lineup offering
basically the best motherboards in a
number of price categories thanks to
their high-end vrm designs that are
suitable for unleashing the full power
of an overclock to cry nine
19900 k the motherboard that we have
here and this is quite a heavy box this
is the gigabyte z3 90 horas master so
this is right up near the top of
gigabyte said 390 line up it's a $300
u.s. motherboard of their about sued
expected to handle the 9900 k
overclocked and it does thanks to a
proper 12 phase V core erm Steve's
already done a bunch of testing with
this motherboard so you can go back and
check that out if you want more
information on how it performs compared
to some of the other high-end said 370
and Zen 390 boards but needless to say
it's one of the best said 390 boards on
the market and be right at home in our
new test system so thanks to gigabyte
for providing that one the other key
thing for this build is the cool of the
1900 cave runs hot and we need something
pretty capable to get the most over CPU
so for this but we're gonna try out the
new H 115 i Platinum here the new a i/o
cooler from Corsair that includes I
guess a bunch more RGB lighting I really
don't need the RGB lining for the build
but it might look cool more importantly
I'm interested to see how this new 280
millimeter closed-loop cooler will
handle the 9900 k overclock we'll get
back to you guys on that after the build
is complete the rest of the stuff is
pretty standard for our test systems for
memory down here actually it's over on
this side we have our 16 gigabytes of
Corsair Vengeance ddr4 at 3000 CL 16
speeds dual channel kit and over here we
also have a course air force le 200 this
is a 240 gig capacity model this is just
a basic boot drive we have separate
drives destroying benchmark apps and all
that sort of things so don't anything
crazy from those two components for the
power supply you've seen it up here the
Corsair RM 850 X we've used that in our
previous test system and we'll use it
again here because it's perfect for this
sort of testing we do and of course the
modular design makes it easy to work
with and then for the case it's not up
on the table here but we asked Corsair
to provide whatever sort of case they
felt like and they sent over a carbide
275 R and don't need anything fancy so
we'll see what that case is like the GPU
it's probably the least necessary part
as that's the thing that's swapped out
the most often in our test system and
for this build just for the sake of it
I've decided to put in the NVIDIA
GeForce r-tx 2070 founders Edition this
is a card that I have literally never
used before it's just been sitting on a
shelf ready to be you
for something so I figure I should
probably make sure it actually works we
use it for this build anyway time to put
the system together get ready for that
awesome builds music from Leakey and
I'll see you on the other side
you
you
so everything is now built the system is
here beside me and I reckon for a test
system it looks pretty good I guess for
now that is these sort of things can get
pretty messy after a bit of usage and
swapping things in and out messing
around with SSDs and all that sort of
thing the corsair h 115 I plot name is
definitely the star of the show the new
RGB effects not only with the fans but
also the pump block or I can look
awesome with the previous Pro models I
think you only got one RGB LED on the
pump but that's now up to 16 with the
Platinum I think that really shows the
Auris master also has a few nice RGB
effects on it similar to the last board
I used from them in my test system
however I was a bit surprised the
motherboard shipped with gigabytes older
BIOS design on it by default gigabyte
has done some work to improve their BIOS
layout but you'll only get that if you
upgrade the BIOS to version F 5 or
higher at least with my units that I've
got here also a quick word on the case
the corsair carbide at 275 r this is one
of course there's more mid-range cases
in the one corsair sent out is the
acrylic side panel version as opposed to
the tempered glass version actually
prefer the acrylic side panel for this
test system because most of the time the
side panel will be removed and the glass
version is more likely to break
however the hex key screws around the
edges and I guess corners here they keep
the side panel a pretty annoying
definitely would have preferred
something more like tools thumb screws
or something like that I'm also not sure
why the acrylic version doesn't come
with a top dust filter while the
tempered glass version does I wouldn't
have thought they would have
distinguished between the two models
there but certainly they have so I think
for most people that are buying this
case I'll probably go for the tempered
glass version instead of the acrylic
version but again I like the acrylic
just for my use case here aside from
that's a pretty easy case to work with
there's plenty of room on the reverse
side for cable management all the holes
are in the right places getting the 280
mil radiator in the front as well no
sweat you can put that up to a 360 ml
radiator in there if you want to and I
guess I also love the case in white
reckon it looks pretty good anyway let's
talk a little bit about performance one
of the key goals for this build was to
overclock the core I nine ninety nine
hundred K to the maximum and then see
how it would go in terms of voltages and
a
temperatures on the corsair h 150 ni
platinum i wasn't a hundred percent sure
whether a two eighty millimeter
closed-loop cooler would suffice for an
overclocked 8 quart intel space heater
but it turns out it's actually pretty
decent so here's the basics of what I
achieved I pushed the Korra nine ninety
nine hundred a five gigahertz all core
overclock and set the voltage to one
point three one volts V Corps with
gigabytes turbo load line calibration
setting which does a great job of
managing v core droop one point three
one volts is a little lower than Steve
achieved with his ninety nine hundred K
samples so I guess we off to a great
start there this overclock was validated
in our standard one our blender stress
test if it passes that it's good to go
for pretty much everything temperatures
at the end of the run we're sitting at
89 degrees Celsius from a 24 degrees
Celsius ambient so that's a very
respectable result from a 280 mill
closed loop cooler
yeah 89 degrees is still quite hot but
of course is smaller H 100 I Pro was
basically maxed out on Steve's ninety
nine hundred K test system at 5
gigahertz whereas the H 159 Platinum
here is actually capable of cooling the
nine hundred K with this sort of
overclock it's also worth mentioning the
Steve only managed to shave off a few
degrees from this result with a three
sixty millimeter open-loop so overall
very happy with this cooler and the
performance II the only thing L says the
cooler isn't particularly quiet at these
temperatures using the bounce mode for
the fans it decided to push up to around
1700 rpm under full load which produced
moderate noise levels the cooler is much
quieter under less intensive loads such
as gaming and it's basically silent at
idle but you can tell blender on a 5 gue
hertz 9900 k is stressing this cool app
pretty hard
still i'd give it a pass overall and
this certainly won't be any need to
upgrade to a larger cooler for this test
system I'm also quite pleased at the
overall size of the builds my last test
system in the be quiet dark Bay 700 was
a bit of a beast in terms of its size
and weight this new build is much more
compact which is better for office setup
bit of an unexpected bonus there anyway
that's it for this build video in the
near future if you're wondering what I
mean when I say I've used my koi 919
