Bluetooth speakers often come down which
exact features you prefer and simply
pricing available in Australia from eBay
for just 76 95 with free shipping the
x300 is certainly extremely competitive
price wise for speakers I'm such a
reputable brand so let's dive in and
take a look at the features of delivers
the speaker itself is wrapped in a hard
textured rubber that's no doubt durable
and designed to be so the speaker grille
is made from metal and as such is quite
sturdy to the shapes our speaker allows
it to sit both horizontally and
vertically this orientation doesn't seem
to affect the way it sounds too much at
all
although horizontal gives the most open
sound with its rounded edges mangled
front I like the overall shape and
design of the x300 very much our model
on hand is blue as you can see it also
comes in ready pink as well as fronds in
charcoal which in my opinion is by far
the best colorway the x300 is quite
small and light coming in to 152
millimeters wide 69 millimeters high and
71 millimeters deep it only weighs 335
grams which is lighter than some gaming
headphones I've reviewed lately as a
result the speaker is quite portable
although there's no supplied way to fix
it to anything it isn't quite as mobile
as the X 100 and it won't fit in your
pocket for instance but it certainly
does sound better than this little
brother the sound quality is basically
what you'd expect from this kind of
speaker Logitech it packed in for
drivers with two front-facing active
drivers and then two side mounted
passive drivers as a result it offers
quite good bass and very good volume for
its size the sound is pretty clear
though of course this speaker is really
only suited to small quiet environments
or for background music you're not going
to be recreating project actually this
thing but I think that's pretty damn
obvious it was good to find that the X
300 doesn't really distort at all max
volume Logitech have done a good job
with the X 300 digital processing this
wireless speaker is able to act as a
speaker
phone it does include an inbuilt mine
however there aren't any controls on the
device itself aside from volume this
limitation bleeds over into media
control I really like when these
speakers have a play/pause and skip
buttons included and I think if you're
going to include speakerphone
capabilities and a button to answer
calls is really essential the buttons of
the speaker does have simply include
volume up and down as well as a pairing
button which all appear on top of the
device but in horizontal move I like the
tactile feedback these buttons offer
then the other button on the device is
the somewhat hidden power button found
at the back left alongside a small blue
indicator led the Logitech logo is
featured at the back middle and then to
the right is a three-and-a-half
millimeter auxiliary Jack and the
microUSB charging cable port the battery
honestly leaves more to be desired it's
okay at an advertised five hours but I
think that closer to nine hours is
really the minimum that I want out of a
portable device like this pairing the
device is easy although there's no NFC
functionality it's still very quick and
simple I didn't have any performance
issues with the x300 when my smartphone
was within a few meters and only
experienced some very occasional
dropouts at around eight to ten meters
overall the x300 is a pretty good
speaker especially once you consider its
price its physical form is pretty cool
the buttons of nice and sound qualities
right there it's small the light and all
in all it does what it's supposed to do
there are many competitors for the X 300
around the same price point that offer
the same kind of sound performance as
mentioned a better battery would have
been nice though is there a better
budget Bluetooth speaker that you know
of let me know in the comments or on our
