completely bonkers Just Cause series has
arrived and every bit as crazy as we'd
hoped like the previous versions there's
at least a thousand square kilometers or
400 square miles for our Liberia and
Myanmar and of course American viewers
for the players to roam and wreak havoc
it's hard to believe but it's been five
long years since Rico Rodriguez first
began blowing things up in Just Cause
two is now returned home for Just Cause
3 only to find it under control of an
evil dictator giving him the perfect
excuse to blow up yet more stuff but
this time the new guns gadgets and
vehicles and not just that Riku now has
a very cool wingsuit it can be combined
with his grapple and parachute for
extreme sports like mobility now as you
might expect after such a long period
between titles the third installment
delivers some significant visual
upgrades just towards three boards High
Definition textures more complex and
realistic destruction and the latest
graphical effects such as global
illumination screen space reflections
pocket depth field edge paid and
invidious wave works water technology
although Just Cause 3 is an Nvidia game
work supported title it's already
running really well in AMD hardware
assuming you have the latest crimson 15
point 11.1 beta driver installed which
addresses a number of graphical glitches
Radian users were facing in the game and
video has also released the GeForce game
ready driver 350 9.0 seeks for Just
Cause 3 which tested using that very
driver the testing fraps was used to
report the minimum and average frame
rates during two minutes of gameplay and
we took the average from three runs the
test starts who play Jar where we jump
into a snazzy looking car that changes
color every time we load the test we
then drag the car taking the same path
every time in turn
facility opening a ramp and ending up in
the drink before we get to performance
numbers here's a run-through of that
very test using the geforce gtx 980ti
and a port-a-potty
first up at the popular 1080p resolution
we find that despite Just Cause 3 is
impressive graphics the game is very
playable on lower end graphics cards
such as the geforce gtx 960 and radeon
r9 380 speaking of which here we see no
difference in performance between the
two gigabyte and 4 gigabyte models at
1080p which isn't entirely surprising
despite the fact that the game will use
over 2 gigabytes of vram in this
resolution when it's available the 4
gigabyte 960 for example so a VRAM usage
climb as high as 2.9 gigabytes in our
tests still with around 50 FPS on
average at a minimum of 40 FPS or more
both the 960 and 380 provided a pretty
smooth experience at 1080p as for the
rest of the cards tested most had no
trouble averaging around 60 fps or
better even a 1440p with VRAM usage is
well over 3 gigabytes the higher
capacity for gigabyte models of the gtx
960 and r9 380 offered no real
performance advantage in just 2 or 3 the
game plays very well as long as the
minimum frame rate is kept about 30 FPS
so ideally at this resolution games are
want to ride at least in r9 380 X or GTX
970 that said for an optimal experience
we recommend the unknown 390 or GTX 980
finally at 4k games will ideally want a
Radeon r9 Fury or better so far I've
been playing Just Cause 3 at 4 K using a
single geforce gtx 980ti
the experience has been great as I said
if you can keep the minimum frame rate
above 30fps the gameplay surprisingly
well and with a 41 FPS average I didn't
notice much input lag like you would in
other games pulling myself away from
this game to do some benchmarking wasn't
easy
you would think rattling around blowing
things up the halibut would get boring
pretty quickly so far it has a just
coaster is a great-looking open-world
video game that plays extremely well on
currently
and NVIDIA hardware providing the latest
drivers are installed prior to that
we've noticed a lot of graphical
glitches and suffered a number of
crashes so fingers crossed that seems to
be behind us now unfortunately as it
stands no multi GPU technology is
working in Just Cause 3 and that isn't
because AMD and NVIDIA have been lazy
rather Just Cause 3 engine is not
compatible with either SLI or crossfire
we knew the Avalanche will need to
release a game patch in order to enable
multi GPU support it's been a rough year
for multi-gpu owners first we had all
the issues with Batman Arkham Knight and
then Assassin's Creed syndicate and now
word is broked
the Rainbow six siege will be yet
another title that's incompatible with
multi-gpu solutions something we didn't
show in this video as a focus on current
generation GPUs for CPU performance all
of our testing was done using a core i7
6700 K which only saw around 30 to 40
percent utilization that said I did swap
it out for the core i3 6100 noticed
around a 30% decrease in framerate at
1080p and utilization never dropped
below 90% likewise I saw around a 30
percent performance reduction when
moving to my FX 8350 system as well with
processor utilization constantly above
70% so keep that in mind CPU
overclocking when possible might be
required to avoid GPU bottlenecks in a
games explosive yet tranquil
environments for now I'm satisfied with
the performance being delivered by both
camps and I'm not sure if there's much
more performance that can be squeezed
out of either the Radian or GeForce
graphics cards that said I expect to see
a few more game patches in the coming
weeks and months and I really hope they
can add multi GPU support for better 4k
performance thanks for watching another
