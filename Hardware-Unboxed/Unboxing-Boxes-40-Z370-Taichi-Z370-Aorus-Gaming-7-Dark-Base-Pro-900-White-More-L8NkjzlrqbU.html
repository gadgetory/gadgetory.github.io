episode of unboxing boxes the first the
original and the only unboxing show on
YouTube yeah
anyway um got my knife my really blunt
one that seems to upset quite a few of
you but I'm gonna stick with it for now
well we've got yeah three five packages
in total let's get into them I think we
have some more said 370 motherboards
asrock haven't set any boards yet and
gigabyte hinted at sending an even
better one than what I looked at in the
last episode this is the box from asrock
very motherboard shaped as they usually
are from our rock
speaking of z3 70 motherboards or more
speaking of coffee-like Intel's eighth
generation Core Series which is upcoming
you'll see that very shortly on the
channel I was going to do a little gag
with my Intel mug which I've glued
together now it's super glued together I
thought I did a really good job gluing
it together but I filled it with coffee
which I was going to drink during this
episode and it sort of leaked out of the
cracks here in wanna over the place so
it would have been kind of humorous if I
had done on camera but yeah I did at my
kitchen and yeah I kind of already knew
it didn't hold its liquids so yeah my
coffee mug I wish I had a working intel
coffee mug but yeah something to look
forward to hopefully we can get one on
the channel eventually but anyway no
coffee but what we have here is the new
asrock zed 370 Taichi
get out of the box well this is about my
six tyshee motherboard now we've had
quite a few of them said to 71 floating
around somewhere as an x3 knight on one
there a couple of other ones anyway
let's check this one out
okay well we got a fairly standard iOS
shoe looks like we've got a Wi-Fi
antenna couple of uh we've got four SATA
cables the Bluetooth antenna
it looks like a two-way SLI bridge
that's pretty well useless at this point
cool little azeroth post card for when
you go traveling and you want to write
back to your loved ones they'll come in
handy for that they'll love it a couple
of em two screws three of them we've
probably got three M two slots and I
don't know what we got here some sort of
round disk with a mirror
kind of a weird mirror if you know
that's all about anyway we'll work that
out light up okay there you go
the asrock Zed 370 Taichi a beauty looks
very much like all the other tire boards
we've seen so nothing terribly different
about it I've got the same sort of
geared heatsink over the chipset they
work well not cool maybe the guys have a
point
this knife is pretty bad but a pair of
scissors here let's have a go close
alright I have freed the motherboard
from its foam enclosure what to say
about this one isn't obvious looks like
we have a pair of intel gigabit network
ports a couple of USB 3.1 there's a Type
C there we've got to the 802 11 Wi-Fi
with Bluetooth looks like we have a 12
phase vrm so that's fairly sound I think
it's what we pretty similar design so
far what we've seen from the Zed 270
board but yeah that probably shouldn't
really be that surprising I suppose but
now yeah pretty cool looking board
overall I'll feature that in some sort
of build or something on the channel
soon no doubt yeah hopefully I've thrown
up some nice b-roll of it you guys have
got a good look at the board no idea I'm
pricing yet no idea if any of the
370 because that hasn't been
announced but it will be very shortly
looks like it's got the purity sound for
stuffs that's the ALC 12:20 codec yeah
so plenty of nice quality features on
this board probably should be fairly
well priced most of the Tai Chi boards
are so yeah good bang for your buck this
is ed - 370 board from house rock
they're all right better clean this up
okay let's grab one that from over here
we've got this little tiny package here
not gonna make the mistake I made last
week cuz this looks like it's the same
sort of brown bag with all that weird
insulation stuff you know I'm not gonna
cut into that and make it off it's
actually got a pull tab there you go
look at that that's how a professional
would do it looks like we got a yep
that's it looks like we've got a CPU
here shiny new unused CPU and it is a
core i7 78 20 X so that is an 8 core 16
thread model base frequency of 3.6
gigahertz 11 megabyte level 3 cache
that's of course the new new LGA 2066
socket for the X - 9 iron chipset and it
was released back in June when we were
reviewed it but I didn't actually get
one for Intel so this is a chip from
Intel now so I now have so I now have
the full set from until and I just
touched the gold contacts on the back so
well didn't last long throw that out now
okay so as Rock said 370 motherboard new
Intel 8 core CPU we're doing pretty well
so far let's get this one this looks
pretty interesting as usual I'm doing an
unboxing boxes episode because well I
need a couple of things out of these
boxes and you guys do not like it when I
do in any unboxing without you but also
I'm just taking a break because we're
pretty deep into the eighth generation
core benchmarking it's all going really
well exciting stuff getting a can't wait
to show you guys I thought I just need a
bit of a break from the benchmark
grinder unboxing boxes is always a bit
of fun ok
oh gosh maybe I can shop it you can shop
and I've Scott yeah yeah give that a go
there might probably be a YouTube video
about it alright well we have lots of
foam here and behind the phone we have
what looks to be another box this one in
black yes it is another unmarked black
box I actually genuinely have no idea
what we have here I'm so glad you guys
can't see off camera in the studio here
I've done a few unboxing boxes episodes
over the last few weeks and I haven't
really cleaned up after them so there's
a lot of empty brown boxes anyway
hopefully we'll have another empty box
well once I get into this we'll take out
what's in it and then it'll be empty
alright huh another one of these things
always funds it sounds kind of purply on
the back alright
bit of foam more foam wow I really fancy
looking RGB IO cover so we have to be in
for a pretty big treat here so it's in
an it's in an x2 9 on orous gaming 3 box
so I assume this is a gigabyte product
wow this is a very heavy motherboard
okay it's a pretty impressive looking
board let's get all this ugly plastic
off it okay so we have a gigabyte
motherboard that much is clear a Norris
brand board it has an LG a 20 66 socket
so I can use that core CPU I've just got
on this boards that's handy as for the
rest of the details I where's the okay
it's me
okay it's the X 399 or so we were right
on that much gaming could I guess that
gaming 7 Pro okay so the extra 9 horas
gaming 7 Pro interesting so I knew of
the gaming 7 now we have the pro model
here not that long ago we got the gaming
9 which is on my test system at the
moment I use that to test these 16 core
18 core parts so we have the Auris
gaming 9 now we've got the 7 Pro yeah I
honestly don't know what to tell you
about this board because I know nothing
about it give me one moment okay I just
had a look online and there appears to
be no information about this board none
so yeah I don't know who knows less
about this board me or the Internet but
yeah the new Oris x-29 gaming 7 pro and
apart from the fact that it's a really
heavy awesome looking motherboard I
don't know what else I can tell you it's
got a little fan there to cool the heat
sinks on the vrm it looks like a very
massive at vrm it's not in the gigabyte
website yet at least it wasn't at the
time of unboxing yeah it looks very
similar to the gaming
9 that I've actually got on the test
system at the moment but yeah so there
you go throw up some beer I'll give you
guys a closer look at it if I get any
more I'll probably ring Gigabyte plate
if my gigabyte contact later today ask
them what is actually knew about this
I'll stick it in the video description
in the comment section below so yeah you
guys can know what it's all about
there isn't any pricing yet either I
check to the Australian retailers and
the US that's not an Amazon or anything
like
yeah so mystery board here don't know
when it's gonna be released during that
kind of information but I won't get that
info for you guys so moving on I think
we have another gigabyte motherboard
here so let's see if this is one that I
can actually tell you something about I
hate these plastic bags I don't know
where to cut into them okay we have
another gaming 7 motherboard here this
one though is a little different you
guys missed all right so we do indeed
have another gaming 7 board or gaming 7
but this is the Z 370 board so again I
won't have any pricing information or
anything on this board because it is yet
to be released and all that stuff is
still under NDA but it looks like this
is the first time I'm seeing this board
as well this is on the gigabyte website
though this board so you can jump on
there and check out the specs a little
more detail Wow of course a that is a
seriously nice-looking motherboard that
so this is the air the Auris gaming
seven of these at 370 board I really
love the i/o cover hue so most of the
boards now they've gone with these
plastic i/o covers and they are pretty
much all the ones I've seen made out of
plastic now which is fine but a little
bit yeah it's plastic so this is
structurally it's plastic but gigabyte
to give it a bit more of a premium look
and feel they've put aluminium sort of
covers over the top of it so that gives
it a pretty cool look in here they feel
nice so there's three different types
they've sort of got a a brushed
aluminium silverish kind of looking one
they extend down here this is more of a
gloss mirror finish um
yeah very cool and then there's more of
a sort of graphite
burnished kind of dark gray one there
they've done the same thing over there
heat sinks as well and I like the way
that these are made out of aluminium so
they will still transfer heat from the
heat sink so if you have air floating on
top of those that will work well much
better than what MSI are doing by using
plastic I'm not sure why they use
plastic there but aluminium is
definitely a better way to go for
removing heat from heat sinks now the
heat sinks themselves they're not
heavily finned but they've got a few
fins so yeah I mean they're fairly
substantial in size they're linked
together using a copper heat pipe which
is nickel-plated so that should work
pretty good but yeah I'm just blown away
by this board it looks really cool from
the photos on the box it looks like the
RGB lighting on it is a very very
impressive I've got a little sneak peak
on the back here don't know how well you
guys can see that but you can probably
see it over on the Gigabyte website as
well but a lot of the heat sinks and
stuff have LED lighting your hardware
RGB lighting so that's pretty cool
gigabytes very much on point these days
with their RGB game and this one looks
to be no exception
yeah part from fancy lighting it looks
like you get a seriously good audio
solution on the board looks like you I
think it's a gig and Intel gigabit
ethernet with a killer you give it a
thern ette so decent networking no Wi-Fi
on this particular board again there is
a fan as well for cooling the verum so
that's for those that use this board for
water cooling that could come in handy a
little fan that and a how loud it gets
but that'll be something I can probably
control on the BIOS anyway a really
really cool looking board overall I'm
keen to use this one in a build that's
for sure okay
we actually have I was wrong at the
start there is another big box and I've
got a case as well so we'll look at the
case last we'll get into this package
just before we do okay what do we have
here
it looks like the new HyperX cloud alpha
was a really bad shot hiding up on the
wall behind me we have a few different
Kingston HyperX headsets big fan of them
I did a roundup over a tech spot
possibly two years ago now and the
clouds the original clouds were pretty
much my favorite headset of that roundup
if I caught recall correctly really good
value a really good sound quality now I
have to work out how to get into this
box and we go off we go there the
packaging for these is always very cool
as well lift off there's nothing written
in this one so what do we got here
congratulations thank you very much
little Quick Start Guide and the
beauties themselves well so finally I
have a product I can actually tell you
the price of right now these are selling
for $100 u.s. which is very very
reasonable they are selling phone for a
hundred and seventy Aussie so it's a
little bit pricey there I would expect
them to be about 130 Aussie based on the
US pricing and also the price of the
previous models as well the 130 ozzie
these are really good buy 170 bit steep
but I'm yeah cuz I feel really nice
can't get them on what else we got in
the package uh comes with a noise
cancelling a detachable mic so that
would just pop in the bottom here like I
say so there you go and that I'll bend
around and all that sort of stuff so you
got the mic there believe we should have
an inline audio control here so you up
some nice braided cables also a really
cool sort of soft bag to put them in if
you're travelling to land events or
whatever I'll get some b-roll of this so
you can get a better look at it but that
is the inline volume control
disable enable mic so that's what we
have there so at this end of the cable
you have little headset icon on the I'm
a tag here that's because this end goes
into the headset so it's kind of got a
interesting connector on the end but it
goes right up into their clips in nicely
and it's quite firm in there so you have
to pull it quite hard to get it back
yeah but it is nice the fact that it is
a detachable cable only problem is
though if you do lose this cable or
break it you probably can't just replace
it with any kind of cable we need one
with a thin color here so it could be a
slight problem so but as always look
after your cables and things take that
off did anyone see where I put the noise
cancelling microphone it's not connected
into them here it is found it you can
stop looking okay so I love the way this
has a metal frame as well very nice very
durable looks cool as well and then
you've got the foam padded sort of
leatherette head defrost well they're
the they're well insulated I can barely
hear myself so you can move the mic
around it's quite good you'd probably
want to have it just off to the side
something like that that should work
well now apparently each one of the ear
cups has a dual chamber so it helps
separate the base from the highs and
mid-range sounds that's pretty cool
I'll give them a shot in a second to see
how they sound and there is a fifty
millimeter driver in each one of the ear
cups they sound really good they sound
as good as I remember I don't know how
this will sound if I put them near the M
got there to go that way
I said really nice extremely comfortable
this could be on your headset I've been
using I've actually been using one of
the clouds might be the cloud twos I've
actually been using them for quite a
while so I might swap them out for these
I definitely will yeah they sound just
super nice and very comfortable the
headset itself without the cable weighs
298 grams so that's pretty good there
they hold your head really well without
being too heavy
they're um yeah they move around a
little bit if you shake your head but
you can't throw them off easily they
hold on much better than a lot of the
logitech sub tried a few other headsets
but yeah they're um really really
comfortable so yeah I'm hoping the price
of these in Australia comes down a bit
more for you fellow Aussie so having one
hundred and thirty dollars would be a
really good price for these but one
hundred and seventy that's getting up
there a bit but anyway I'll provide some
buy links for Amazon for the US shoppers
in the video description if you're keen
to check them out yeah really nice there
you go they fit quite nicely in there
got all the cables the microphone and
the headset in that back quite easily so
you can now put that in another larger
bag your keyboard your mouse or your
cables and go have yourself a nice fun
time and a local LAN party all right now
we have a really really exciting case to
look at it's technically not a new case
but it's kind of a new case this might
be hard to show on camera it's quite a
big case but anyway we'll see how we go
of course I did that around the wrong
way but as you can see it is the dark
Bass Pro 900 it's the limited edition
white version so let's get it out and
check it out I have no idea which way up
this is I think I've got it the right
way
oh it's around the wrong way again
seriously what are the chances tada
well that looks pretty awesome well
there you go the be quiet dark Bass Pro
900 for those of you who don't know this
was is still an awesome case it was
released back I think in 2000 early 2016
maybe I don't recall I reviewed it at
the time and I did review it on tech
spot it was definitely over a year ago
now and I checked out the black orange
version it was just an amazing case you
can invert it so the glass panel can be
moved to the other side and the
motherboard can be rotate and does a lot
of cool stuff it's very modular I'm just
an all-around awesome design some
awesome things about this case based on
the original version which I believe
this is exactly the same as original
it's just now and what I had stuff like
wireless charging for mobile devices
smart phones and stuff like that
obviously a nice big tempered glass
panel which has now become kind of more
of a standard feature but still it is a
nice big life panel in this case there
is a bit of sound deadening the back
steel panel on the back side that does
have some nice sound deadening and there
the some in the front as well from
memory yeah the big highlight of this
case is that modular design it's a lot
of fun to play with takes a bit of time
to change it all around but you do get
something quite unique and it can
the setup you are after so yeah very
cool the only downside to this case and
depends call it a downside I mean it is
expensive so obviously that is a
downside but you do get what you pay for
it's $250 us and I believe because it is
a limited edition the white one there
are only about 500 for sale in the US so
I have no idea how many they've sold but
if you want one you may have to act
quickly and it works out to be about
three hundred and seventy dollars in
Australia I have no idea how many they
have allocated for Australia there are
two thousand white limitation models in
total and apparently there is a plaque
and yes here so I have okay so I've got
number 53 of 2000 I'm not sure how long
they've been on sale for this is Aussie
stock my plaques a bit crooked so
hopefully I can straighten that up I'll
get a b-roll shot of that yeah I won't
talk about this case I'll go on about it
too much because I will be doing a
building it like now I'll be starting
what I'm going to chuck beside of this
new gigabyte motherboard that is
definitely going in there put a
all-in-one liquid cooler in there couple
other bits and pieces and yeah it should
be a pretty cool build so that'll be my
new Zed 370 build for now so I better go
get cracking on that
so yeah I'll end it here I don't know
how long we've been going for but it
felt like I blasted through it bit
quicker than I normally do I do have a
lot of testing and still what I get a
big big review down on the unlocked core
i7 8700 K so I better get back to that
yeah thanks for watching we got a few
good motherboards couple of them over
there we got a kingston hyperx headset
which I'll actually be wearing tonight
that was very comfortable and sounds
great hopefully it came through ok and
the mic don't really done that before
I think it's ready so thanks for
watching I'm your host Steve catch again
soon
