along with the half a dozen use in two
based third-generation Verizon
processors AMD has also released an
additional two rise in 3000 series parts
and they're using as n+ architecture
though you would be forgiven if you miss
them
I'm of course talking about the new ap
use the Rison 332 G and Verizon 530 400
G to date AMD's yet to sample these
parts but as we did with the risin 5
3600 rather than sit around waiting for
AM D to provide the goods we went out
and bought up with the help of our
patreon members so the 3500 G has been
sitting on my desk for over a week now
so I thought it was a bad time I got
around to testing it we are yet to
purchase a 3200 G so this one will just
be a look at the flagship APU when
compared to previous models the upgrades
are pretty straightforward because AMD
is using these n+ architecture these
parts are manufactured using the 12
nanometer process which offers improved
clock speeds and thermals also helping
with thermals is an upgraded box cooler
at least for the 3,400 G which now gets
the Wraith spire and this is a 95 watt
cooler the 3200 G still keeps cool with
the base model Wraith stealth the 3400 G
also does away with the thermal paste
interface material this means it's
soldered just like the big boy chips the
CPU cores have been overcooked by 8%
from 3.9 gigahertz to 4.2 years while
the vaguer 11 graphics engine comes
clocked at 1.4 gigahertz and that's a
12% boost from the previous model the
final improvement AMD's made has been to
the all-important price whereas the 2400
G sported a $170 u.s. MSRP the 3400 G
starts at just 150 dollars u.s. now for
testing I'm using the MSI be 450 Carbon
gaming with 16 gigabytes of G skills
flex ddr4 3200 memory I won't be
covering these ap use from every single
angle like I did for the 2200 gene 2400
G as most of the information such as
memory scaling is still relevant from
our original testing so if you're after
that kind of information then please
check out our original coverage for now
I just want to see what difference there
is between the 34
and 2400 G so let's jump into the
benchmarks to find out first up we have
Sinha benches are twenty multi core
tests and here the 3400 G provided a
nine percent performance uplift from the
previous 2400 G model largely due to
that 8 percent increase in clock speed
and partly due to the improved IPC
performance of these n plus architecture
it's also worth noting that the r5 3600
is 81 percent faster in this test while
only costing 33% more though it does of
course like integrated graphics and
we'll talk more about that later on the
video we also see a rather large 10
percent improvement in single core
performance and again this is due to not
just the increase in clock speed ball so
the improvements made by these n+
architecture this place the 3400 G on
par with the r5 2,600 X and this time we
see at the r5 3600 was just 15% faster
as it's not able to utilize those extra
cores in this test memory bandwidth
performance is much the same as n+ did
improve memory latency but as you can
see in terms of memory bandwidth both
sustained a transfer speed of 36
gigabytes per second the 3400 G was 10%
faster in the 2400 G in these seven zip
compression tests and while that is a
decent little performance bump in a
world where 6 core processors now
commonplace it doesn't look that
impressive
AMD's SMT implementation is very
efficient when it comes to decompression
work in 7-zip and as a result of 3400 G
did beat the core i7 7700 K and wasn't a
great deal slower than the 6 core 6
thread 9600 K I've tested premier using
two configurations one with the GeForce
r-tx 2080 TI the standard graphics card
used for all our CPU testing and then
one using the integrated value 11
graphics for GPU acceleration with a
highly capable discrete graphics card
the 3400 G is actually very impressive
in this test completing the render in
just 629 seconds however with a discrete
graphics card it took 1762 seconds and
that's not so great
so if you were going to use this
processor for video editing and encoding
buying an entry-level graphics card
would be the way to go or better yet
just get the r5 3600 and pair that with
an entry-level graphics card the 3400 G
was just 4 percent faster than
400g in the corona benchmark and while
that made both much faster than the core
i5 7600 k they were slower than
everything else similar margins are seen
in the blender open data benchmark this
time the 3400 G off at a 6% performance
boost over the 2400 G and both trailed
the 7700 K when it comes to power
consumption the 3400 G still sips power
pushing total system consumption just
10% higher than that of the 2400 G and
this meant system usage was 10% lower
than what we saw with these 7600 K
moving on to operating temperatures and
here we see when running the blender
stress test that the 3400 G peaked at
just 58 degrees using the Wraith spire
box cooler out of the box it sustained
an operating frequency of three thousand
nine hundred fifty megahertz and when
enabling PBO Plus Auto see in their eyes
and master software that frequency
didn't change then when testing with f1
2019 the 3400 G ran much cooler
despite the Vega 11 graphics now being
in use here the CPU peaked at just 45
degrees and ran at 4025 megahertz then
enabling PBO Plus Auto OC pushed the
operating temperature up to 48 degrees
and this time we did get an extra 100
megahertz bump in the operating
frequency before jumping into the
integrated GPU testing let's just
quickly see how the 3400 G stacks up
against the other CPUs when comparing
performance with out a GPU limitation
here we see at 1080p it's faster than
the core i5 7600 okay and not a great
deal slower than the 6 core 12 thread r5
1600 moreover it provided an 11% boost
over the 2400 G the 3400 G is even more
competitive at 1440p situating itself
between the r5 1600 and 1600 X so not
bad for a budget processor performance
in battlefield 5 was also respectable
for example the 3400 G mimics the 1% low
performance of the core i7 77 ok while
the average was only slightly down the
r5 1600 this time the 3400 year was up
to 10% faster than the 2400 G we find a
similar story when testing with the
division 2 here the 3400 G of has a 7%
performance increase over the 2400 G
while trailing there are 5 1600 by a 10%
margin the 3400 G is still 8 percent
faster than the 2400 G at 14
40p but now it is able to close in on
the 1% low performance of the r5 1600
and 1600 X now this is a pretty
impressive result NAT first you might
think the 17% performance uplift over
the 2400 G is a mistake but I assure you
it's not the improved cache and memory
latency of the Zen plus architecture
gives the 3400 G a big advantage in
farcry new don so much so that it's now
able to match the r5 1600 X the merchant
does come down a little at 1440p but
even so the 3400 G was still 12% faster
than the 2400 G and once again managed
to match the r5 1600 X ok so now it's
time for some Vega 11 I GPU testing and
here we see a mere 5 percent improvement
in performance over the 2400 G certainly
nothing to get excited over that said
the good news being that the game was
highly playable at 1080p pushing well
over 60 FPS at all times next that we
have Rainbow six siege and here the 3400
G was up to 8 percent faster but again
both AP use performed very well
rendering over 60 FPS at all times even
at 1080p of course we're using the
lowest possible quality preset but this
is of course integrated graphics after
all so that is very impressive fortnight
also plays well at tiny P but
unfortunately the 3400 G offered no real
performance gains over the older 2,400 G
in this title we also see a similar
thing in Far Cry nude on despite the CPU
side of the 3400 G being much more
punchy in this title the vaguer 11
graphics with its small overclock don't
help here much we also see next to no
difference in strange Brigade the 3400 G
provided a few extra frames but that was
it once again a similar story is seen
when testing with f1 2019 the 3400 G is
only good for a few extra frames but at
least the game was playable even at
1080p now this is very interesting
World of Tanks sees a 14% performance
improvement when upgrading to the 3400 G
this is a title that benefits from these
n+ improvements but also isn't
necessarily GPU bound when using the
integrated graphics so it's a rare
situation where the improved CPU
performance can be utilized in game with
the Vega 11 graphics when AMD released
the first
Zen based APIs back in February last
year
it really wasn't exciting time for those
products to hit shelves and that was
because at the time graphics card
pricing was just crazy was heavily
inflated and that was of course due to
the cryptocurrency mining hell even if
you were prepared to spend the three to
four times more than you should have on
a graphics card the shelves were
completely empty so buying one it was
near an impossible the 2400 G and 2200 G
gave desperate gamers on a budget and
alternative these apos let you play
games now all beat with low quality
visuals but they gave you the ability to
play now and then upgrade to a discreet
graphics card later on once pricing
settled down today though we have no
such issue the second hand graphics card
market is thriving and you can buy a
brand new radio rx 570 for as little as
a hundred and thirty dollars us and it
will enable a vastly superior gaming
experience it's really like comparing
chalk and cheese still the APU option is
cheap for those buying new hardware the
Rison 530 400g costs all of a hundred
and fifty dollars us having said that
though I feel like in today's market it
is a bit of a niche product and I
realize AP yous are a bit niche to begin
with but I feel like that's even more
true of the 3400 G given what you can
buy for not much more for example if
your primary interest is gaming arisin 3
1200 for $65 new with an IR x5 70 for
$130 or a secondhand model for $60
that's a significantly better gaming
combo new it costs just 30% more and
you'll see over 200% more performance
but if you're willing to shop secondhand
on the graphics card if the combo will
be cheaper than just buying the 3400 G
also for heavy productivity work the
3400 G isn't really a cost-effective
option either rather you're better off
just getting a rise in five sixteen
hundred four hundred and five dollars
and then pair that with a dirt cheap
discrete graphics card you better get
something for the $45 that's left over
if all you want is a basic PC for office
type work then the 3400 G is a suitable
choice likewise if you're building a
compact home theater PC and gaming isn't
the focus then again the 3400 G is quite
a nice option beyond that though you
really are better off with the
alternatives I just spoke of
and even then you can't really ignore
the 2400 G because right now that can be
had for $100 and given that the 3400 G
was never 50% faster I myself would
probably just go out and get a 2400 G
and then pocket the $50 save that and
put it towards a better graphics card in
the future if gaming is your focus and
that is going to do it for this one like
I said not a full-blown top-down
coverage of these new ap used like we
did originally we looked at how they
perform on different motherboards how
memory scaling works I didn't even know
there was so many tests I can't recall
them all but yeah we're not going to do
that for this one it was really just to
see how much better the 3400 G is
compared to the 2400 gene I think we've
we've done that so yeah not too much
more to say perhaps down the track we'll
do some updated testing with the latest
updated drivers to see how the 3400 G
handles itself in a wide range of games
definitely something we could do but
yeah right now we have a lot of other
content that we want to cover such as
The Horizon 730 800 X tons of you guys
are requesting that I've ordered one
it's making its way to me slowly so I'll
test that when it comes i've also
purchased a horizon 530 600 x thanks to
our lovely patreon supporters we've been
we've spent well over a thousand dollars
on these new horizon processes because
we don't want to wait for AMD to sample
them whenever that may be
so yeah 3600 X versus 3600 that'll be
coming soon to see if it's worth
spending extra money
3800 x versus 3700 x that's also coming
and yeah we may also buy the 3,200 G and
do some testing with that as well
anyway plenty of testing to do so I
better wrap this up and get on with it
if you enjoyed the video please hit the
like button subscribe for more content
and if you appreciate the web with your
horror boxed and you want to make sure
that we can purchase whatever processes
that we we can't get sampled then yeah
jump over to our patreon page you can
support us there and there's a whole
heap of horse awesome perks as well
thank you for watching I'm your host
Steve see you again next time
