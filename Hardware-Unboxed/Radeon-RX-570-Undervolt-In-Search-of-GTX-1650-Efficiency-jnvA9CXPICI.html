what I was thinking just the other day
there's something we haven't done enough
of on the channel we really haven't done
enough comparisons of him the geforce
gtx 1650 and the Radeon rx 570 okay
bitter sarcasm there I almost couldn't I
couldn't really keep a straight face
during that one we have done a stupid
amount of gtx 1650 content over the past
few weeks but every single test just
seems to lead into another one and well
there's been one test that you guys have
been requesting ever since i initially
tested the gtx 1650 and that is an under
volting comparison with the RX 570 so
take the RX 570 and then see if we can
starve it down to GTX 16 50 levels of
power consumption so this is a more for
science type test we do those every now
and then they're a bit of fun but yeah
just to be clear this is not a buying
guide and I'm not trying to find a way
to justify recommending the RX 570 over
the GTX 1650 we already recommended the
RX 570 over the 1615 our day one
coverage and so did something like 99%
of all other tech media outlets so yeah
this is just a for science test and I'm
really just doing it at the request of
you guys therefore I whipped out my
gigabyte horas RX 574 gigabyte so along
with a little copper insert in the back
that looks really fancy but anyway I
grabbed this guy and I started doing
some tinkering so the aim here was to
try and get this down to GTX 16 50
levels of performance so basically under
clock this card till it's performing
similar to this card and then tune the
voltages and power target to try and get
it well give it as efficient as possible
while delivering the same level of
performance so that was the aim and yeah
that's what we're doing this video but I
had a few challenges along the way
because the asset quality of this
particular horas rx 570 isn't great fact
it's a it's pretty poor really so yeah I
didn't win the silicon lottery with this
particular graphics card gpu-z reports
the asset quality beat is sixty five and
a half percent that means it's
only better than four-and-a-half percent
of all our x5 70s in their validation
database so that means it is a bit of a
stinker but for this test I think that's
actually good news at least from my
perspective anyways it means whatever I
achieve with this card will be
achievable by almost all our x5 70s so
I'd rather test with pourcel that can
oppose to a model with an asset quality
of I don't know 90% or better as that's
not really representative of your
typical rx 570 I did just recently buy a
new 8 gigabyte rx 570 and it has a
reported asset quality of 72 percent
making it better than 30% of the RX 5
seventies in the gpu-z
database so again not great silicon here
but it is better than my original model
anyway since all the testing for this
video was conducted before I made that
purchase I've just stuck with those
results and I'd rather show a worst case
scenario anyway so everything you're
going to see in this video will be based
on the gigabyte horas model using AMD's
watt man I set the power target to minus
40 the voltage to 1010 millivolts at
state 7 with a base clock of 12 hundred
megahertz now if I left the power target
unchanged the RX 570 was still very
power hungry and I even found reducing
it down a minus 30 had no impact on
power consumption it was like no changes
were being made it wasn't until I hit
minus 40% of the power consumption was
reduced and quite substantially so was
the performance I was also able to get
the voltage down to 980 millivolt but
the system wasn't 100% stable here and
would occasionally crash to the desktop
at a thousand millivolts did appear to
be 100% stable but for a little
reassurance I left at 1010 millivolts I
have seen reports of rx 570 owners who
are getting down to the 960 to 990
millivolt ranging frequencies between
1250 and 1350 megahertz but they're also
reporting an asset quality of over 80%
so that was more yeah top quality
silicon additionally I've also seen a
lot of reports from rx 570 owners that
could only achieve what my Oris model
does so obviously just like overclocking
your mileage will vary and under
vaulting success is very much silicon
dependent anyway at 1010 millivolts a
minus 4t power tower
GPU power consumption dropped down to 88
what's that means a stock rx 570
consumes 72 percent more power however
even under vaulted the RX 570 was still
consuming 24% more power than a stock
GTX 1650s so this level you still
couldn't run it solely from PCIe power
still this is a massive improvement of
what the rx 570 sees out of the box but
how much impact does this reduction in
power consumption have on performance to
answer that I first fired-up farcry new
dawn and here we saw the RX 5-7 he
basically matched the stock gtx 1650 so
here it was consuming 24% more power for
the same level of performance not great
but it's certainly not bad for a
three-year old architecture and of
course stock the RX 570 is 24% faster
than the gtx 1650 though it does use
twice as much power to achieve that
performance uplift then with both GPU is
fully unleash the RX 570 is still 23%
faster in this title Forza horizon 4 is
a strong title for AMD so it comes as
little surprise that the under vaulted
and overclocked RX 570 is able to beat
the stock gtx 1650 in fact it even
matched the overclocked 1650 and that
actually makes the undervolt at RX 570
more efficient in this title then when
we throw it efficiency at the window and
overclock them both for maximum
performance the RX 570 is 21% faster
Resident Evil 2 as a more balanced title
and here the undervolt at RX 570 was 5%
slower than the stock gtx 1650 so for
this game the GeForce GPU is far more
efficient but if all you care about is
performance at overclocking both to the
max ease the RX 570 win by a 30% margin
making it the vastly superior GPU in
terms of FPS performance finally I took
a look at the most recently released
title it we've added to our battery of
benchmarks and that title is World War Z
here the undervolt at RX 570 was a
whisker faster than the stock gtx 1650
but that still makes the GeForce GPU
more efficient but this time we do find
we're looking at maximum performance the
overclocked rx 570 smoked the
overclocked GTX 1650 by an almost 40%
margin well there you have it
is technically possible for the RX 570
to get much much closer to the gtx 1650
in terms of efficiency but
unsurprisingly it can't match it after
all it is a three year old product so if
AMD were to make a Polaris based 75 watt
Radeon it would be quite a bit slower
than the GTX 1650 but I suppose if they
did so and offered it at $100 it would
actually end up being a better product
again it's the price that's the ultimate
issue here some of you think I flat-out
hate the GTX 1650 and that's simply not
the case I really do admire what NVIDIA
has been able to achieve here with a 75
watt Capet is truly impressive the issue
as I've plainly stated time and time
again is that at $150 u.s. it makes no
sense to buy it's unsuitable for low
powered budget OEM pcs is it's just
simply too expensive and in any PC with
an ATX power supply the rx 570 is a
vastly superior option while also saving
us some money at the same time of course
if there was a $150 low-profile version
of the GTX 1650 then I could understand
the appeal of that product for
higher-end small form-factor pcs but
short of that it's useless in my opinion
and you know the second msi gigabyte or
whoever else makes a low-profile version
it'll cost around $200 making it an even
tougher sell anyway not going to rehash
that conversation any further I think
really just the point of this video was
to see how efficient we could make the
Radeon rx 570 and as I said it was just
a for science type test and really
nothing more than that so yeah I found
the results interesting hopefully you
guys did as well and if you did you can
give us a big old thumbs up that would
be much appreciated you can also
subscribe if you're not already to make
sure that you catch our other content
and you can support us on patreon
because that allows us to buy graphics
cards like the the eight gigabyte rx 570
that we needed for certain testing baby
weight that's gonna do it for this one
thank you very much for watching I'm
your host Steve I'll see you again next
