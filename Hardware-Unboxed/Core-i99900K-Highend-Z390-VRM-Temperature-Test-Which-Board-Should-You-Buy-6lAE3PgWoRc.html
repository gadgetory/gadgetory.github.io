checking out the vrm thermal formats of
a few high-end z3 90 motherboards not
this many I will eventually get through
this many and many more but today we're
just doing four we're looking at fairly
high in boards from a sous asrock MSI
and gigabyte they're all priced around
$300 u.s. now before I jump into the
test results let's just quickly go over
each of these motherboards have a look
at the cooling and then of course the
very layout and design I'll start with
the Taichi ultimate rabbit forever here
it's quite a heavy board so this is as
rocks most premium Zed 390 board
currently costs 290 dollars u.s. and it
offers some really neat features you've
got ten gigabit networking so yeah some
really cool stuff on board but of course
we are here for the vrm covering the
components are two slabs of aluminium
with a few slots cut into them to help
maximize surface area and capture a
little more airflow you wouldn't want to
rely on them too heavily so hopefully we
have some higher quality components on
board removing four spring-loaded screws
the heat sinks come up and we find some
pretty typical looking thermal pads what
I'm more interested in though are those
ten five by six millimeter power stages
which make up the V chord v RM these are
Texas Instruments ESD eighty seven
thirty five zero power stage is rated
for up to 40 amps but are 90% efficient
at just 25 amps they're connected to an
IR three five two zero one controller
and eight phase-- controller though here
just five phases are used each of then
double using an IR three five nine eight
phase double are the actual vehicle
configuration looks like this here we
have a combined peak current capacity of
400 amps or 250 amps at ninety percent
efficiency and this is certainly far
more than you need to run a kora 999
hundred K at five gigahertz for example
so the azrog Zed 390 type cheat ultimate
as a very salt looking board and I'm
very keen to see how it performs but
before we can do that we have three more
boards that we need to check out and the
next one I'll list
is the msi z3 90 ace this is a 270
dollar US model and I believe it is the
cheapest of the four boards we will be
looking at in this roundup I've skipped
over the msi godlike since it's well
it's pretty stupid overkill it costs a
small fortune and I suppose above all
else it is a limited run deal so yeah a
limited edition motherboard that then
makes the ACE MSI's real flagship Zen
390 motherboard and well it's a pretty
decent looking board the heatsink design
is very similar to what we saw on the
asrock board you get two slabs of
aluminium that are connected using a
heat pipe and then there's a few slots
cut into them but yeah it's far from a
finned heat sink the heat sinks are also
attached via four screws though these
ones aren't spring-loaded and you get
the same kind of thermal pads underneath
I should note though that the larger of
the two heat sinks is almost completely
encased in a plastic shroud which is
used to cover the i/o headers on board
we again find the ir35 2:01 controller
and this time six phases have been
dedicated to the vehicle each face is
again split using an IR three five nine
eight phase doubler giving the ACE a
twelve phase vcore BRM unlike the
godlike we don't have integrated power
stages but rather separate high-low FETs
for the higher side MOSFET we have the
4c 0 to 9 and and for the low side the
4c 0 to 4 n so for each phase we have
one of each component these are on
semiconductor MOSFETs the high sides
rated for a current capacity of 46 amps
and the low side 78 amps which I believe
gives the phase a peak current capacity
of 46 amps on paper that a should be a
little bit better than the Taichi
ultimate but of course we will have to
go over the results in a moment and see
what's what
flowing out though we have another board
to check out and it's probably the
best-looking board of the bunch also by
far the heaviest and it is the gigabyte
horas Z 390 Master or I think it's
actually the gigabyte Zed 390 or ass
Master my rule about just 2 words it's
getting abused a lot with these product
notes but anyway gigabyte has been I
suppose you could say down and out now
for some time when it comes to there
our hem game we sort of saw pretty ugly
scene there with their be 450 boards
their new ex 399 board wasn't bad but
still not as good as we would have liked
to have seen but I think they're about
to change all that with their new range
of Z 390 boards gigabytes entire range
of Zed 390 motherboards looks really
impressive and I will be testing out the
cheaper models right down to the
absolute cheapest model on the channel
very soon today though we have the Zed
390 or s master a $290 us model that
looks incredible this is a motherboard
that impresses from top to bottom and
the vrm is no exception
nor is the vrm cooling actually let's
start with the cooling at first glance I
have to admit the board did did trigger
me a little bit gigabyte has covered
almost the entire heatsink or the larger
heatsink in plastic and this really made
my eye twitch when I first saw it they
do seem to be using the plastic as a
shroud to direct airflow or through over
the heatsink which I suppose isn't bad I
do question how well the heatsink behind
the i/o panel works but ultimately the
thermal results will speak for
themselves so I can only be so critical
at first glance oh the cooling doesn't
really look that impressive in fact it
looks quite unimpressive you get what
appears to be two aluminium bricks with
a few slots cut into them what we've
seen on some other heat sinks and then
they're connected via a heat pipe so
what we're lacking here are some proper
finned heat sinks however if we spin
them around to the opposite side we do
actually find that they're kind of like
hybrid heat sinks we find some real
finned heat sinks that are integrated
into the backside of the aluminium slug
airflow still looks as though it will be
limited as the opposite side the side
without the proper fins doesn't feature
that many cut out so you can only flow
so much air through this heat sink and
of course the top of it is covered in
plastic but anyway it is an interesting
design this hybrid finned heat sink
design so we'll have to see how it
performs now removing the heat sinks is
quite a large operation as the backside
of the board features a massive
absolutely massive heat spreader or
backplate I suppose and it's not just
there for show this thing does remove
heat from the back side of the PCB using
thermal pads under the verum components
and it works incredibly well anyway with
all the heat sinks removed to find
another variant rolled by the ir35 2:01
and here we are taking six pwm signals
from the controller for the vcore vrm
those signals are then each doubled
using an IR three five nine nine phase
doubler creating twelve phases each of
which is connected to an IR three five
five three power stage these chips are
rated for a maximum current output of 40
amps with a peak efficiency at around 15
amps but will deliver over 90%
efficiency at 25 amps even at just 25
amps you're looking at a combined output
of 300 amps so needless to say the
gigabyte board has some serious Headroom
built in okay so the last board we have
on hand for testing and this sort of
four-way high end battle is the isuzu
ROG Maximus 11 hero and I actually had
to buy this board as seuss weren't too
keen on us getting one for testing so
yeah I've just gone and bought one of
course they might like being what it is
of the four boards here this is the most
expensive one in Australia not in the US
it's the same price as the I think it's
the as rock and Gigabyte boards but yeah
it's five hundred and forty dollars
Ozzie quite an expensive motherboard but
thankfully we have a lot of loyal
however a box patreon members and well
they allow us to buy Hardware like this
one we have two so big thank you to the
patreon members for allowing us to buy
the Maximus 11 hero for testing I really
wanted to test this board out for a few
reasons
firstly it's the only high-end Zed 390
board to pack a four-phase VRM and boy
oh boy did I cop some flak from the
Isuzu fanboys it seemed when I pointed
that out in a recent video actually it's
not up for debate as to whether or not
this is a four-phase board well it's not
really up for debate because it is a
four-phase board but if you argue with
the Zeus fans you would be led to
believe that maybe it's not a four-phase
board so I guess it all comes down to
what you class as an actual phase a sous
called this a twin eight phase design
there are four signals each going to a
pair of power stages so it's then a
doubling of components I suppose which
is we've seen this before
in short 28 phase is marketing BS again
we've seen similar things in the past
from gigabyte neighs rock and they have
copped a serious amount of flack for it
so I'm not sure how a soos is getting
away with doing the exact same thing or
at least how they think they'll get away
with doing the exact same thing I'm sure
a soos fans will wise up to what's going
on here sooner or later as far as I can
tell this is what the vcore verum looks
like the ASP 1400 CTB controller is
likely a rebadged ir35 2:03 or an IR 3 5
2 0 1 doesn't really matter as there
isn't a second controller so at best
you'd be looking at a six plus two phase
configuration but because we have 10
power stages in total 8 for the via
varium it's taking 4 PWM signals from
the vehicle and 2 for the eye GPU each
signal for the vcore is going to a pair
of vishay si si 6 3 9 power stages each
rated for a 50 amp maximum current
capacity and at 90 percent efficiency
around 25 amps these power stages are
running in parallel so they do share the
load but it's not quite clear how well
load balancing works but we do know they
are switched on more regularly than they
would be in an eight phase--
configuration assuming the same
frequency and therefore will generate
more heat the main issue here is that a
su is not being honest when they claim
the hero as a 10 phase board using an 8
+ 2 design it's a fad for phase and
nothing more a soos aren't doing
anything special here we've seen a
doubling of components on many boards in
the past the hero also seems to want to
run in a 95 watt limited configuration
even with the power limit removed will
reduce the uncor ratio - times 43 rather
than x 47 used by all the other boards
I've tested the board with the default
times 43 which I won't be showing the
results for that because that's unfair
to the other boards but I have tested
that and it does reduce power
consumption by a small amount and
therefore it also reduces the vrm
thermal build-up but for all the testing
I will be forcing the cash or encore at
4.7 gigahertz rather than the default
4.3 gigahertz at the
tries to runner anyway a soos has gone
with a very basic heatsink setup which
is comparable to what we saw on the
asrock and msi boards so I'm very keen
to see how this thing performs to apply
load to the system I'm not using a power
bug type program like prime95
for this test I want to choose a
real-world application something you
might actually run on these boards for
an extended period of time so I went
with a blender workload that takes the
99 Herrera and hour to complete so the
load results are reported after an hour
of running the blender workload and then
the idle is taken after a 10-minute
cooldown period there are two tests in
total first we'll be looking at stock
results so out of the box 9900 Kay
performance without a 95 watt limit in
place then a 5 gigahertz overclock using
1.3 volts both tests will be conducted
twice once on an open-air test bed with
no direct airflow over the vrm then we
have a second test configuration inside
the corsair 500 d with 3 120 millimeter
intake fans in the front to 120
millimeter intake fans in the top and a
single 120 millimeter exhaust fan in the
rear so the top mounted fans are pushing
airflow directly over the board's vrm
heat sinks then calling the CPU is the
corsair h 115 i pro which was mounted in
the front of the case to record the
temperatures i'm using a digital
thermometer with k-type thermocouple x'
i've placed multiple sensors on the
surface of multiple power stages to
measure the temperature across the VRM
and i'll be reporting the highest value
i'm also reporting the highest
temperature i was able to record on the
underside of the PCB for the MOSFETs
this means I'm measuring the temperature
directly on the top of the component
between it and the thermal pad and not
an internal temperature which is bound
to be a little higher still with all
boards tested under the exact same
conditions that will give us a clearer
picture of how the VRM temperatures
compare and just finally I'm not
reporting delta T over ambient instead I
maintain a room temperature of between
21 and 22 degrees I have a thermocouple
sitting next to the test system
monitoring the room temperature and I
have a special thing called climate
control that maintains a target room
temperature and thanks to the way my
office is insulated and designed it
works very well it's important that I'm
actually able to test this way and not
use delta T over
ambient doesn't work too well when I am
measuring performance as a high
room-temperature will negatively impact
performance today we are just focusing
on temperatures so it's not such a big
deal but when I was running these
benchmarks or these thermal tests on
these motherboards I was actually
running benchmarks and performance
benchmarks with applications and whatnot
and I may show that data in a future
content piece anyway we're already over
2000 words so I'd better get into the
results first up we have these stock 99
hundred K results on an open air testbed
with no direct airflow the Taichi
ultimate provided the best result here
cooling down to just 42 degrees 10
minutes after our hour-long stress test
had ended the Auris master also did well
dropping down to 43 degrees and the
underside of the PCBs highest
temperature recorded was just 39 degrees
MSI's ace wasn't quite as good but
certainly not bad and then we have the
Maximus 11 hero which only cooled to 52
degrees making it the hottest of the
bunch not a terrible result but it was
10 degrees hotter than the asrock board
okay let's move on to see how things get
under load so it appears as though the
Auris master comes into its own under
load here the VM peaked at just 53
degrees and in fact after just 20
minutes the temperature had maxed out
and from there it maintained of the 53
degrees that you see reported here the
Tai Chi ultimate also does very well
pending 57 degrees now I have to say I
was a little disappointed to see the MSI
ace reaching over 60 degrees or just
over 60 degrees immediately this is
still a great result but it is a very
big step back from what the godlike is
capable of then we have the Maximus 11
hero which peaked at 70 degrees making
it by far the hottest of all the board's
tested that said this is still a very
acceptable temperature given that there
is no direct airflow over the board
though having said that this is also a
very cool room and remember we are
measuring the surface temperature of the
components and not the internal
temperature which is bound to be at
least 10 degrees hotter it's worth
noting though that the asou and gigabyte
boards do share the same price tag and
yet the Auris master did run 17 degrees
cooler under these test conditions
moving on I threw the boards inside the
corsair crystal 570 x and again the case
was configured with a top mounted fan at
blowing
over the motherboard CPU socket area in
other words it was feeding the verum
heatsinks with cool air I'd say this is
very much a best-case scenario and no
pun intended and what we have here is a
well ventilated case that I'm not saying
the 570 X is a high airflow case but
with the fan configuration used here
there is no shortage of cool air couple
that with the reasonably low ambient air
temperature and we have the perfect
environment for a motherboard and it's a
vrm at idle all boards ran well under 40
degrees and remember these results are
reported ten minutes after the hour long
stress test interestingly the underside
of the tight she remained quite a bit
hotter than the topside and this wasn't
an issue seen on the other boards moving
on under load the Taichi again gets
quite hot on the underside of the PCB
and in fact quite shockingly I measured
the same temperature on the underside of
the board as I did directly on top of
the hottest power stage the underside of
the Maximus 11 here I was much cooler
despite similar verum component
temperatures still with plenty of
airflow the assess board ran at a
reasonable temperature though it was
gigabyte who delivered the goods running
an impressive 11 degrees cooler so good
stuff there but I think it's now time to
do some overclocking okay so out idle on
an open testbed with the 1900 over clock
to 5 gigahertz we see very similar
attempts to these stock results and that
well that makes sense we're really only
adding a little bit more voltage at this
point that said the Taichi is now hotter
on the underside of the PCB which is
something we saw previously in the load
testing but not the idle test still with
the exception of the Maximus 11 hero all
boards seem to operate between 43 and 45
degrees so let's see how these boards
handled after an hour long blender
stress test doing so didn't actually
raise the temperatures that much from
the stock results we see an increase of
about 5 to 7 degrees the Gigabyte Norris
board saw a 5 degree increase while the
MSI and Asus boards increased by 7
degrees so nothing really alarming here
that said though these results don't
tell the full story at least for the
asou sport again the gigabyte MSI and
asrock boards all peaked after 20 to 30
minutes and beyond that point they were
able to maintain the temperatures you
see reported here the Maximus 11 hero
it reached 70 degrees at about the 40
minute mark and by the end of the test
was at 77 degrees however it was
continuing to slowly increase in
temperature the ambient temp remain the
same but ever so slowly the vrm was
getting hotter and hotter so I went back
and retested again and after three hours
it hit 84 degrees and I believe at that
point it had stopped increasing in
temperature but this will require even
further testing but of course all this
testing does suck up a lot of time for
reference I also rechecked the asrock Z
390 Tai Chi ultimate and after two hours
it was still reporting these same 66
degree peak temperature so thermal
build-up doesn't appear to be an issue
for these other boards so that means if
you plan on placing your 9900 k under
full load for very long periods of time
this is something to be aware of in that
case I highly recommend the Gigabyte
horas master also keep in mind this
isn't necessarily a worst-case scenario
for the V RMS they could certainly face
much more abuse in a poorly ventilated
case or a hotter climate or god forbid
both moving on to what I can see that a
best-case scenario inside the crystal
570 X we say after 10 minutes of idle
all four boards are nice and cool the
surface temperature of the components on
the tire actually the coolest while the
underside of the PCB is the warmest the
underside of the hero is also quite warm
as is the surface of the components at
least relative to the other boards then
once again we find all four boards
perform very well inside the crystal 570
X with plenty of direct airflow of
course the Gigabyte Zed 390 or s master
is an incredible standout here and after
what we've seen in the previous verum
tests looking at X 399 and B 450
motherboards this is a really surprising
result for gigabyte it has to be said on
the other side of that though it is an
equally surprising result for a soos it
seems a soos and gigabyte have traded
places ok so some interesting results
and overall no real duds amongst these 4
motherboards some models were certainly
better than others and just to clarify
by dad I mean there were no you know
alarmingly high temperatures or failures
of any kind
previously when testing B 450
motherboards we
the flagship gigabyte and a soos models
hid unacceptably high temperatures while
the as rock and MSI boards did very well
and then with the x3 99 boards a soos
and msi did very well
while gigabyte and asrock didn't do
quite as well at least when overclocking
the 32 core months that is the twenty
nine ninety WX and for that test that
was actually our extreme stress test so
we were using a bit more voltage than
necessary but that's kind of the point
of an extreme stress test I wasn't
actually able to conduct an extreme
stress test with the core I $9.99 or
okay and I simply couldn't keep it cool
I'd have to delete the thing a file down
the silicon and bring an even bigger
open-loop cooler not exactly out of the
box testing that so what have we learned
we've learned that the isuzu ROG Maximus
11 hero is beyond a shadow of a doubt a
four phase motherboard a fat four phase
motherboard but a four phase mother
bought all the same it works well enough
but is without question inferior to all
competing boards of a similar price and
I suspect a number of boards that are
even cheaper will be better namely those
from gigabyte I'm also aware of other
media outlets and even some pro
overclockers who have managed impressive
over clocks with the Maximus 11 hero but
make no mistake there are better options
out there and all of them are easier to
overclock with getting the Maximus 11
hero stable at 5.1 gigahertz with my
sample was seriously difficult and
actually required more voltage than the
other boards that I've tested the use of
a four phase verum means poorer voltage
regulation more ripple and hotter
operating components compared to what
we've seen on the 10 and 12 phase boards
tested here it's actually pretty hard to
believe you're getting this vrm for the
same price as this vrm but that's the
situation when comparing their sous and
gigabyte Zed 390 motherboards I should
just note that if you are gaming and not
placing all that cause under a full load
for extended periods of time then
honestly all this doesn't matter too
much any one of these boards will get
the job done and should live a long and
happy life that said if you're placing
all that cause under full load for hours
on end and you're doing so on a rig
your basis then I'd simply avoid the
Maximus 11 hero but most of you though I
suspect it's fine still having said that
if you're willing to spend almost $300
us on a motherboard there are at least
three much higher quality much better
options in my opinion and none of them
lie about their varium phase count if a
sous just came out and said the Maximus
11 hero is a doubled up for phase board
and they think that's better for X
reasons I wouldn't really have an issue
with that
but lying to their customers and their
fans just isn't cool and while it seems
well seems quite evident that some are
soos fanboys I might defend them no
matter what this is still a four phase
motherboard no it's a it's a twin a
phase you gigabyte as rock and/or MSI
shell anyway enough about the Maximus 11
hero it is what it is it's not a
terrible board it's just probably not
worthy of the asking price at least in
my opinion personally I would be getting
the gigabyte master such a heavy
motherboard and yeah before you
seriously go and try to call me a
gigabyte shill down the comment section
below just sit down and relax maybe
watch some of our previous motherboard
videos before passing that judgment and
if you can't be bothered watching our
previous videos and you just want to go
ahead and drop a comment saying we're
this the absolute worst shields and
fraudulent people on worse for I don't
know whatever you guys come up with
something negative
you should just probably know that in a
very recent content piece we did name at
the asou ROG X 3 9 zenith Extreme as one
of the best of the best original x3 99
motherboard and said that it's still one
of the absolute best alongside the MSI
Meg x3 energy and creation and I should
note that a soos didn't provide us with
that sample either if you care about
overclocking and erm performance then I
highly recommend you check out the
gigabyte Zed 390 or ass master really
amazing board that one I'm I'm just
quite stunned by how well it performed
given our last few VRM
tests the asrock said 390 Taichi
ultimate that's another very solid board
really nice board that one and it would
be my number one pick if you wanted to
use the 10 Gigabit Ethernet because
obviously that makes it a really really
good value board then we have the MSI z3
90 ace yeah that's another solid
offering it's a little cheaper than the
other three boards but not by Anik
significant margin I think it's about
$20 a US didn't really stand out to me
as being really special in any one area
and to be asked I was hoping it would be
a little more godlike and then it turned
out to be our next up I'll probably test
out the cheapest Zed 390 boards by
looking at the MSI Zed 390 a pro yep
that's it there yet the Zed 390 a pro
that is correct I wasn't sure if pro was
meant to be on the end so I've got this
board obviously on hand already I have
the obvious drag it over here it's off
to the side the asrock said 390 pro 4
another pro board for the entry-level I
would also like to take a look at the
gigabyte Zed 390 UD there's quite a few
boards up here still out of shot so I'll
be testing that one as well and then I
will most likely have to purchase the
asou said three 90p I believe that is
the cheapest seuss board but yeah I have
to buy that one so I've got the other
three boards which I can start testing
now or order via seuss board early next
week
get that on hand and you know that's
another one we can thank the patreon
members for for supporting the channel
and allowing us to buy hardware to test
and that is going to do it for this one
I hope you guys enjoyed verum testing of
a thermal testing rather of these four
motherboards some interesting results
like I said no real duds but certainly
some boards were better than others if
you liked the video you know what to do
subscribe for more content if you would
like to see more videos just like this
