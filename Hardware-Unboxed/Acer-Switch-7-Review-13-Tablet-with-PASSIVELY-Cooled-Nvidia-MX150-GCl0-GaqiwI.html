I'm looking at a brand new and very
interesting product from the wonderful
people at Acer who raced this down to
Melbourne on a weekend just days after
it hit our shores it's the new asus
switch 7 a high-end surface light tablet
with a kickstand and detachable keyboard
complete with Black Edition branding and
according to ASA Black is timeless it's
not only rational but emotionally
constrained its luster gives a chic and
performance visual sensation so
interesting marketing aside the key
feature of the switch 7 is at least in
my opinion very impressive this is a fan
'less 13.5 inch tablet yet despite what
should be obvious thermal constraints
ASA has crammed in both an Intel Core i7
8550 u processor along with discreet
nvidia geforce MX 150 graphics discreet
GPUs are usually restricted to 15-inch
laptops or larger with the occasional 14
unit seen in the wild so it's a feat in
itself that the switch 7 a much smaller
device contains a discrete GPU but on
top of that that have included this GP
along with the new Intel quad-core CPU
without a single fan instead using what
ASA calls a jeweled liquid loop cooling
solution descent heat away from these
components and distribute it around the
chassis that's entirely passive cooling
for a 15 watt CPU and around a 25 watt
GPU all in a 13 inch tablet form factor
so you can see why I might be a little
bit excited about taking a look at the
switch 7 our hardware includes 16 gig of
ram and a 512 gig SSD as standard along
with the 22 56 by 15 or 4:3 to aspect
ratio IPS LCD but just a 35 point 1 watt
hour battery cramming in discrete GPU
into this device has taken its toll in
at least one area and that does appear
to be the battery capacity more on that
later for now I want to talk about the
build quality of the switch 7 this is a
premium price product that commands a
high price tag around 1,700 US dollars
so I was a bit disappointed
with the final build both the tablet and
the included keyboard cover the
materials used a good smooth glass on
the front metal on the sides and rear
but there are a lot of seams in the
construction particularly around the
right side i/o and around the display
which doesn't make it look or feel as
high-end as the best tablet or laptop
designs out there the Microsoft Surface
pro for example features a more refined
a metal design in keeping with its price
tag there are also a few alignment and
symmetry issues with the switch 7 that
you wouldn't get with the better design
product the webcam for example is offset
to the right by a large distance for
seemingly no reason at all even worse is
the display position and bezels the
right side bezel is about 2 millimeters
larger than the left side bezel which
means the display is slightly off-center
as soon as I saw the unit I thought
something wasn't quite right about the
bezels and after about 10 measurements
just to make sure I wasn't hallucinating
I indeed confirmed 1 bezel is larger
than the other and that's pretty bizarre
for a modern high-end product the hinged
kickstand assembly is a neat concept in
that it automatically pops out the
kickstand when the bottom edge of the
tablet contacts your desk there are two
buttons located along this bottom edge
that released the spring-loaded hinge
mechanism and from there you can adjust
the exact angle to your liking it's a
convenient system as all you have to do
is place the tablet on your desk and
it's already propped up and ready to use
whether you have the keyboard attached
or not however the system does have a
few significant flaws the stand itself
doesn't look great at least in my
opinion and the groove it leaves in the
rear of the tablet is a significant dust
magnet after this a few days dust and
dirt had already accumulated in the
hinge cavity that's hard to remove or
clean with that compressed air while you
can set an angle for the kickstand and
it can go fairly flat like the surface
pro the spring-loaded hinge prevents you
from setting an angle more acute than
the angle that pops out at this default
angle is suitable for desk work but
there are times I like to use a more
acute angle particularly in glare
environments which the spring mechanism
prohibits the other issue is you can't
pop out the hinge without pressing both
protruding buttons along the bottom edge
this isn't a problem for desk users but
say you want to open up the kickstand on
a soft surface like a
on your lap where the buttons might not
contact your legs in this situation
activating these buttons is much harder
than simply reaching back and flipping
out in the stand that's probably way too
much data on the kickstand but it's a
neat idea that I think needs a bit of
refinement in a future of revision I was
much happier with the i/o included on
this tablet a single full-size USB port
along with Thunderbolt 3 and a microSD
card slot is pretty decent for a space
limited tablet style device though using
a proprietary power connector over USB C
for charging is a little annoying
the evie in my opinion still has the
best ire of any of these sort of
productivity tablets the switch 7 does
include a fingerprint reader on the
front next to the display which exhibits
average performance further up the edges
our front-facing speakers of a
surprisingly decent quality perhaps due
to the limited volume that prevents
awful distortions the keyboard cover is
obviously a key feature of the switch 7
and it's nice to see it included in the
price unlike with a certain microsoft
product the cover is a bit hit or miss
though in that the build isn't that
impressive using a plastic around the
casing and okay but not amazing fabric
on the other side however the typing
speeds is pretty good with a similar
tactile fuel to most laptop case if a
bit lighter than normal there is a bit
of flex when typing though not as much
as I expected considering the build and
it attaches neatly and effectively to
the bottom using
pogo pins and magnets perhaps the best
feature is the include stylus it's a
Wacom unit without power yet it supports
4096 levels of pressure and best of all
it slots into the body along the top
edge yes I said does include a dedicated
style slot which many of these devices
did not which makes it a lot harder to
lose the pen for annotating on the go
it's a great solution so it's time to
talk about performance I'm really
excited about this section because build
quality aside this is the star of the
show again we're looking at an Intel
Core i7 85 52 quad core configured to
use the standard 15 watt TDP along with
an NVIDIA GeForce MX 150 discrete GPU
with 2 gigabytes of dedicated vram we
already know how the eye 78550 you
should perform however its pairing with
the MX 150 does make it considerably
more capable at graphics and compute
workloads
both these chips in a family's chassis
is a huge feat of Engineering I'm not
going to spend a lot of time discussing
the pure CPU performance of the IEEE
78550 I've covered that a couple of
times in the past the key observation
here is despite the use of just passive
cooling the switch seven has no problems
matching other I 78550 you devices
it doesn't thermal throttle
significantly or underperform relative
to the active called standard
performance razor blade stealth
amazingly it's actually faster than the
HP Spectre x-360 in most tests sometimes
by significant amounts I criticize the
spectre x360 in my review for having a
weak cooler so maybe they should have
ditched the mediocre fan that they used
for their fanless design asa uses with
the switch 7 because it's much more
effective however there are some limits
to the switch 7s thermal solution the
switch 7 doesn't feature as high CPU
boost clocks which leads to lower
performance in very short workloads like
MATLAB and excel compared to the same 15
watt CPU in the razor blade stealth this
chart that shows clock speeds that a
Cinebench r15 multi-threaded test shows
exactly this phenomenon lower boost
clocks but decent sustain clocks as they
says prioritize long term performance
rather than short hot bursts performance
does steadily decline during lengthy
tests or back-to-back short workloads
though but it can take upwards of 20
minutes for this to become an issue
which is longer than a lot of typical
laptop tasks the GPU is more effective
than the CPU here too as something like
repeat 3dmark runners do show larger
drops between consecutive runs then we'd
normally see passive cooling solutions
are also limited by the environment they
operate in
so our air condition benchmark lab is
set to around 23 degrees Celsius but if
you're in a hotter summer environment
the cooler will suffer more than an
active solution and performance will be
hit harder as a result however the
passive cooler doesn't seem to limit the
MX 150 or that much performing around
the same level as others have seen from
this jpo in similar systems it performs
a touch below the best MX 150 laptops
out there but it's nothing unusual and
still very impressive for a device
without a single fan of course the main
advantage to having the MX 150 is that
it's a lot faster than intel's
integrated graphics in the heaviest GPU
workloads the MX 150 is about 2
point three times faster than the UHD
620 integrated into the eye 78550 you
this gives it a big advantage in
computer applications that heavily
utilized the GPU premiere for example
run as a 4k video with lumetri effects
84% faster with the MX 150 inside than
just having the eye 78550 you and it's a
similar story with Photoshop smart
sharpen filter compared to the Rison 5
2500 you which also includes a powerful
Vega 8 GPU
along with the CPU comparable to the eye
78550 you the MX 150 power switch 7 is
at best around 12% faster in GPU limited
tests like 3d marks times by graphics
core some applications don't support
rising mobile as well as I'd like
particularly the Adobe suite so to be
good to revisit this comparison when we
get better
rise and mobile drivers as for gaming
the MX 150 isn't a super powerful GPU so
you shouldn't expect to play everything
on this tablet however as it is so much
faster than integrated graphics you can
get a decent experience in a handful of
titles using grand theft auto 5 is an
example you can get a very playable
experience at 1080p and even using the
displays native resolution using the
lowest detail settings civilization 6 is
very playable as well at the native
wresting x' which is good news for those
that want to do some gaming let me go
you won't want to touch the back of the
switch 7 during any lengthy combined GPU
and CPU usage as the passive cooler can
get a bit toasty the CPU sits at around
90 degrees Celsius and the GPU got as
hot as 60 degrees Celsius in my testing
using consecutive 3dmark runs and most
of that heat is dissipated directly
through the rear panel
unfortunately battery life is pretty
poor the best 13-inch convertible or
traditional laptops use a 50 to 60 watt
hour battery but the asus which seven is
limited just a 35 watt hour cell and I
suspect that's due to the inclusion of
the large heat pipe cooler and the
discrete GPU to put this in perspective
the smaller current-gen surface pro
includes a 45 watt hour battery and only
needs to power a 12 point three inch
display the switch 7 is significantly
limited in comparison and you can see
the results quite clearly in these
benchmarks with the switch 7 falling
well behind acceptable levels
for a modern laptop style device while
not a direct competitor a 13-inch
convertible like the HP Spectre x-360
lasts more than 75 percent longer in our
Wi-Fi web browsing test which is an
enormous discrepancy this sort of
battery life affects the usage of a
product particularly something as
portable as the switch
however this level of battery life is
quite clearly a trade-off that's been
made for the added performance it's a
much faster device in the surface Pro
particularly when connected to the
charger but it also has significantly
worse battery life that's something
you'll need to weigh up when choosing
whether you want to purchase this tablet
in the end whether you should buy the
Asus which 7 does come down to one
simple thing if you want the performance
of an Intel Core i7
8550 you and discreet nvidia geforce MX
150 graphics in this tablet plus
keyboard cover form factor this is the
best option on the market in fact as far
as these sorts of hybrid tablets go the
switch 7 is the most powerful one you
can get all without active cooling or
significant thermal throttling but it's
not a perfect device by any means I'm
not a huge fan of the build quality and
while the hinge is innovative it is
awkward for some use cases the keyboard
cover is decent but it is a bit cheaply
built I quite like the high-resolution
3-2 display but it isn't centered in the
chassis the battery life also leaves a
fair bit to be desired compared to a
true laptop or hybrid convertible in the
United States the pricing for the switch
7 isn't too bad it does cost one
thousand six hundred and ninety nine
dollars which might make a few of you
budget conscious shoppers sweat but for
that price you do get a core i7 sixteen
gig of ram and a 512 gig SSD and
discreet graphics as standard an
equivalent surface pro which doesn't
even have an MX 150 or 8th gen CPS costs
$2,200 unfortunately us Aussies are
slugged with a bit of Australia tax on
this product as it costs a whopping 3300
Aussie dollar e dues but it's not too
bad over in America the switch 7 should
be available soon so if you are
interested it links are in the
description below and those should work
at some point once that you know becomes
a bit more available plus we've tracked
in a range of other products in there
