another top five best video once again I
will be looking at CPUs in my previous
top 5 best CPUs video I picked what I
felt to be the best budget CPU best
value quad-core best performance desktop
CPU best value productivity CPU and the
best extreme desktop CPU now that thread
Ripper and Rison 3 are out I will have
to revisit those category soon but for
now I want to do my top 5 best gaming
CPU picks as always I will be taking the
CPU and the platform costs into
consideration and are we breaking things
up into five categories rather than just
picking 5 models at random and not
really explaining why the categories I'm
going to include for this one will be
best budget CPU best affordable
quad-core best value gaming CPU best
no-compromise gaming CPU and then the
best secondhand deal something a bit
different for this one
okay so this processor needs no
introduction budget shoppers everywhere
know the pentium g 4560 upon release it
was crowned of the only kb lake cpu
south of $300 u.s. worth buying and
today that statement is as true as ever
that said finding one for the $64 u.s.
MSRP seems to be a thing of the past the
new price appears to be $80 us or $85
Aussie still that makes it the best sub
$100 u.s. CPU for gamers right now and
it's the perfect pairing for something
like an IR x5 60 or gtx 750ti that said
though it will for the most part be able
to get the most out of the gtx 1060 or
rx 580 so for the money it's pretty hard
to beat and really to beat it
you've got to dish out some more money
it's not interested in an affordable
dual-core well then meet the horizon 3
1200 its hands down at the best value
quad-core CPU on the market right now
and it's excellent for gaming in fact it
doesn't even matter if your intention is
to game or get some work done nothing
comes close for the 110 dollar u.s.
price or 150 dollars Aussie the r3 1200
is able to extract the maximum
performance from the geforce gtx 1060
and Radeon rx 580 you won't find the CPU
creating a bottleneck in any of the
modern games either particularly once
overclocked overclock the r3 1200 also
does very well getting the most out of
the gtx 1070 and vega 56 graphics cards
so it's certainly a very capable CPU
overall and for the money there's really
no better option now you can buy the
core i5 7600 K for $240 u.s. and this is
arguably a better gaming CPU right now
certainly does a lot better in tunnels
such as csgo and overwatching quite
popular esports type titles like that
but I just have a feeling that in a year
or so time the r5 1600 will end up being
head and shoulders above the 7600 K of
course that's all just guesswork and I
could be completely wrong but that's
just a hunch the horizon 5 1600 platform
costs are also much lower than that of
the core i5 CPU and for those gaming at
1440p with say a gtx 1070 there's going
to be little to no difference between
the rise and cpu and the slightly more
expensive quad core from intel
personally i would buy the r5 1600 and
this is their very reason i'm
recommending it to you guys
it's got to be the core i7 7700 K simply
nothing touches it when it comes to
gaming really there's no amount of money
that you can throw at a CPU and get
something that will spit more frames out
in pretty much all modern titles this
could change soon though with the
release of the 8th gen core series I
will have to wait and see how that pans
out anyway for maximum FPS performance
right now with something like the
GeForce GTX 1080 Ti the core i7 77 Eric
8 is hands-down the best choice if you
do anything other than gaming like say
content creation for example then it
might be a different story but purely
for gaming this is as good as it gets
right now
think of right you 100% nailed it I just
I couldn't think of a fifth category to
nominate another current generation CPU
so here we have it the best secondhand
deal of course secondhand shopping it
really comes down to the components you
already have but assuming no obstacles
what CPU should you be looking at
getting on the second-hand market given
what we recently saw from the 2500 km I
rise in three overclocking gaminggod I
have to say this thing despite its age
is still a beast and a perfect pairing
for a modern mid-range graphics card of
course if you can get your hands on a
2600 K or any of the unlocked Ivy Bridge
Haswell or newer Core i5 and core i7
CPUs for a reasonable price then of
course that's an even better deal
frankly if you're gaming with the
geforce gtx 1060 radeon RX 5 ad or
really anything slower than the
experience with an overclocked 2500 k is
going to be comparable to that of the
horizon 3 1200 and likely much better
than that of the pentium g 4560 maybe
intel can bury Sandy Bridge once and for
all with their 8th gen series but I
wouldn't count on it
well there you have it if you're a gamer
looking for the best CPU for your next
game area this hopefully will have you
quite covered the price range extended
from $80 us all the way up to $340 and
with a few good options in between now
if you liked this video feel free to
slap a like on and let us know what your
top 5 best gaming CPU list looks like if
you have anything else on your mind
be sure to share it with us might have
opened the floodgates on that one anyway
I'm your host Steve see you again soon
