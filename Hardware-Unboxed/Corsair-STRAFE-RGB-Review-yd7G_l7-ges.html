I'm your host Matt and today we've got
our hands-on corset gaming's new strafe
RGB MX silent mechanical keyboard not
too long ago we reviewed the standard
straight from Corsair and we were
reasonably impressed it's a really nice
keyboard to use and the only thing we
thought it was lacking was a wrist rest
proving that corsair love and watched my
videos religiously they've decided to
include one in this new RGB model as
well as a few other distinct changes
first of all the RGB model is just that
RGB each key is individually lit and can
be tuned to any color on the ITV
spectrum via the Corsair Utility engine
software the CEO is software also allows
you to create and save different
profiles assign actions and micros fully
customize the lighting and control other
device and software settings there's a
variety of pretty cool standard lighting
effects that you can easily select from
the front page although personally I
find most of them pretty distracting
perhaps the biggest point of difference
on this board compared to at least the
rest of course as range is the inclusion
of style in Cherry MX switches announced
in August these switches claim to feel
and function exactly as the standard
Cherry MX switches
however with much reduced noise there
are two varieties of the solitary MX
switches one is a modification of the
chair mechs black switch and the other
is a modification of the Cherry MX read
our strafe RGB spots the red variety
cherry informs us in their own words
that in order to suppress noises
optimally the precision switching slide
has been supplemented with the TPE
elastomer component the result is less
noise as the case hits the bottom and
spring back up while I can admit that
they are definitely a bit quieter than
the standard switches I'm not sure that
it's going to be enough to satisfy users
who are picky about the noise that
mechanical keyboards make I can't say
that the noise of even my blue switches
at home bothers me at all in fact I kind
of like it so I definitely wouldn't be
personally showing our extra cash for an
MX silent keyboard however it might be
the compromise that some people need in
order not to get
jangled in their office this keyboard is
very similar to the original strafe
aside from an illuminated Corsair logo
at the top left and a wire base
underneath the keys it really reflects
the RGB lighting well you've still got
USB pass-through a Windows lock key
brightness key and alternative function
media keys on top of the included wrist
rest course are also kind enough to
include two sets of texture key caps
WASD for FPS gamers and qwa IDF for
mobile gamers along with a key cat
removal tool physically it's a really
great looking keyboard the straight
design is refreshingly flat and
low-profile with sharp corners and edges
for the most part the build is the
all-around black plastic aside from the
white baseplate I mentioned and wipe
sides it also have an RGB light strip
running through them for effect overall
I really like the appearance of the
keyboard it feels nice too considering
the exteriors all plastic it's quite
weighty which gives it a premium feel
but might not be suited to gamers on the
go as standard the only textured key was
the space bar which I'm honestly not
sure I liked it wasn't a deal-breaker Qi
is the only non-standard keys on this
keyboard are the function key which
replaces the second Windows key on the
right the windows lock key and the LED
brightness key at the top of the board
the function key is tied to media
functions from f5 skipping f6 and then
through to f12 but these can all be
customized in the CEOs software as
mentioned the USB pass-through is a very
welcoming clusion we'd love to see the
courser have included this the cable is
not braided rather just a thick rubber
cable and USB connectors are in corsair
gaming's yellow and black overall the
strafe RGB is a great keyboard and
combines sleek design with longtime
usability I love to see the inclusion if
the full-size wrist rest and gamers will
enjoy having two sets of texture key
caps included to the fully customizable
perky RGB lighting is fun to play an
experiment with and for those that want
a quick result there are plenty of cool
presets to choose from at an MSRP of 149
the pricing is appropriate for the
strafe RGB which for me it takes all of
the important boxes
