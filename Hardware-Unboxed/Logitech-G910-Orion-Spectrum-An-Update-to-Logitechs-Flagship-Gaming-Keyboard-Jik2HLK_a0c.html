newest flagship keyboard the g9
turnaround spa I was reasonably
impressed at the time though the keycaps
use we're pretty questionable in a way I
liked how they hugged my fingers when
gaming but for gliding across when touch
typing there certainly weren't ideal and
some other users absolutely hated them
the G 910 is back now with some minor
changes and improvements and this new
refresh is named the g9 tenor ryan
spectrum is it the flagship monster that
it always should have been
let's take a closer look and find out as
you can see the overall design and
appearance hasn't changed much on this
model the wrist rest has a removable
cover which makes it nice and easy to
clean and I describe it as being medium
in size the G 9/10 logo lights up here
and gives a pretty cool effect so all
around it's a good rest rest setup the G
keys remain and on the left you'll find
five of them plus an additional four
across the top of the keyboard above
your first F keys in the very top left
you'll also find four different mode
keys allow you to quickly switch
profiles for those macro keys there's
slight limitation I didn't like with
this but I'll touch on that later when I
talk about the software the underside is
simple with four rubber pads to prevent
sliding and some standard flick down
legs at the back the ARX control dock
remains this is a slide-out panel that's
designed to hold your phone which I
actually quite liked I found it pretty
useful to have my phone sitting upright
in front of me so I could quickly glance
at notifications without picking it up
or looking away from the screen too much
during gaming it's called the ARX
control dock because the idea is for you
to run the ARX control app on your phone
and to have it sitting there displaying
some somewhat interesting system
statistics to you while you game I can't
really imagine game is using this too
much but it's nice a little extra that
some people will like up in the top
right the media keys remain including a
handy volume wheel I think it's great
that these are included and honestly I
find it pretty much essential for a good
desktop keyboard these days another nice
touch is the etching found on the arrow
keys G keys and the WASD Keys this
allows the awesomely even lighting
delivered by the romaji switches to
really shine through the design of
Logitech proprietary switches means the
backlight is actually positioned right
in the middle of the switch and
and straight up in the center
illuminating the entire face of the key
really evenly you'll find on competing
products that often the secondary
function of the key can sometimes
receive no light at all which is a bit
of a bummer so well done logitech on
this front the USB cable is wrapped in
simple rubber and I would have liked to
see a braided cable here I get that they
perform the same function in the end but
for a flagship keyboard you like the
entire package to feel high quality a
big omission I feel is the lack of USB
pass-through I find it really handy
personally and I think considering the
ARX dock it would have been really nice
to be able to sit your phone in the dock
and charge it at the same time regarding
actual typing on the keyboard I think
the romaji keys are going to be quite
divisive if you haven't tried them yet I
think it'll be fair to say that they
feel quite a lot like membranes for
mechanical switches there is some
tactile feedback with their mushier than
Cherry MX browns and since blue switches
are my favorite they're not really my
preference but it's not like I didn't
like typing on them I could definitely
use them and get used to them quickly
here's a quick type test so you can hear
what they sound like Logitech Gaming
software is attractive and powerful but
one thing I didn't like was that there
was no onboard memory in the keyboard
this means for you custom lighting and
macros to be present you have to have
the Logitech Gaming software running
this also means that on startup and
shutdown the keyboard defaults to the
RGB Christmas tree and if you plug it
into another computer you need to start
customizing from scratch so this is
another feature I really would have
liked to see pricing for the g9 tanner
ryan spectrum is a fair bit higher than
i'd like to see it in the USA it'll run
you 180 US dollars and that's really at
the high end of the market it's also
pretty hard to find that said I did find
it on special at Best Buy for one
hundred and ten dollars online but I
have no idea how long the special will
be around for in Australia the new g9
turnaround spectrum is pretty hard to
find also logitech's website listed for
$250 which in my opinion is way too much
to pay for a keyboard that lacks a few
features that I can see they're pretty
essential overall it's pretty hard to
recommend the g9 turnaround spectrum
when there
keyboards like the g.skill km 780 with
richer feature sets and cherry MX
switches for less money based on the
apparent availability you would seem
like Logitech isn't pushing the g9 10
too hard and that's probably for the
reasons listed above I'll keenly look
forward to their next flagship
installment as logitech's been a long
time favorite peripherals maker of mine
and I have confidence that they'll come
back strong what do you guys think for
