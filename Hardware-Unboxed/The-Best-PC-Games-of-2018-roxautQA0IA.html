that time of year again 2018 is nearly
over and we're here today to give you
our best PC games of 2018 so actually
just a big list of all the good games
that came out this year but we do have
several categories that we'll be handing
out some awards for for these awards we
asked the wonderful members of our
patreon exclusive discord community to
put in some nominations for their
favorite games of the year
both Steve and I don't always get a
chance to play every single game that
comes out in the year we do play a lot
of titles for benchmarking and testing
purposes but we don't often get a ton
time to just yeah sit down and enjoy
some PC gaming sessions so our discord
was super helpful in narrowing down some
of these choices and if you want to come
and chat with us about games and you
know all sorts of other stuffs you you
can sign up to our patreon links to that
in the description anyway without
further ado let's get into the pics
I thought picking a best overall PC game
in 2018 would be a bit of a challenge
there's been lots of high-quality titles
released throughout the year but there
was one that received an overwhelming
number of nominations from our community
that game is forza horizon 4 from
playground games and microsoft studios i
personally played a lot of this game and
thought it was absolutely fantastic and
it's a highly deserving winner of best
PC game
I think racing games can sometimes get a
bit stale but that's definitely not the
case with forts of horizon for this game
is loads of fun it's continually
evolving with lots of new challenges and
events to participate in and it's such a
good experience whether you're playing
it in single-player or multiplayer modes
in fact for this video I originally had
separate categories for best
single-player and best multiplayer but
after examining the nominations I think
for to horizon for takes that in both
categories the game world is vast and
beautiful plus the changing seasons is
such a unique and innovative way to vary
conditions as you play through the
library of cars in this game is
phenomenal as well good luck trying to
earn them all but it's not just the
gameplay that makes this PC game great
it's also the way this game runs on the
platform while developed primarily for
Xbox
what's a horizon for has everything
you'd want from a PC title support for
arbitrary resolutions aspect ratios and
frame rates are wealth of settings
options proper high-end anti-aliasing
excellent controller support and best of
all superb optimization this game runs
brilliantly on both AMD and NVIDIA
hardware without favoring ear the
company while still delivering some of
the best visuals you get in a game this
year the only downside I can think of is
the fact that it's only on the Windows
Store which is a steaming pile of junk
but when you can get around that
limitation there's nothing about good
things to say about forts rise and fall
and I completely agree with our
community that suggested this title for
best PC game of 2018
as PC gamers we love graphics we love
running at high resolutions we love
running at high frame rates and we love
our games - a beautiful after all that's
part of the reason why we choose to play
on PC rather than on consoles to get you
know the best experience a game can
offer so to us a category praising the
most visually stunning game is very
important lots of games delivered
impressive visuals in 2018 including
thoughts of horizon for that we just
spoke about along with titles like
battlefield 5 Far Cry 5 and for that 76
wait maybe not that last one but in our
opinion the game with the best graphics
in 2018 was shadow of the Tomb Raider
this title developed by iris Montreal
and published by Square Enix is
graphically phenomenal it might not have
the biggest open-world or the best
gameplay of the year but Shadow the Tomb
Raider gets nearly every aspect of its
graphics right textures are very high
quality environments are well modelled
and packed with details
foliage quality has been stepped up a
notch and it's capped off by one of the
most impressive lighting systems of you
with excellent volumetric effects bloom
ambient occlusion screen spaced
reflections light shafts and
high-quality shadows shadow of the Tomb
Raider is one of those games that as you
move through environments is worth
pausing and just admiring the work that
has gone into producing such stunning
visuals even smaller details like Lara's
hair and the motion blur implementation
are impressive while it's one of the
first games I've seen where temporal
anti-aliasing actually looks decent best
of all the game isn't ridiculously
punishing to run sure it does take a
high-end system to enjoy this game in
all its glory but I think the visuals
match the performance you get unlike
some other titles released throughout
2018 it also makes a great benchmark for
PC hardware that will continue to use
I'm sure will be used by PC builders to
see how their system is faring for years
to come
optimization is another one of those
categories that's very important for PC
gaming with any new release it's one of
the first things that's discussion ooh
is this game well optimized or is this
just another crappy console port we all
want games to look good but we also want
them to run well across a wide variety
of systems from those on a budget to
those that can afford an RT x20 atti
again Forza horizon four was one of the
best optimized tiles of the year but
there's another game that really stands
out and that's battlefield 5 this is a
visually stunning game and one that's
more complex and ports our horizon for
in terms of environments effects and
multiplayer netcode yet it manages to
run extremely well on hardware not just
from today but also from several
generations ago in our big benchmark
video we showed that GPUs like the
Radeon r9 390 geforce gtx 970 and newer
offerings like the gtx 1060 and iris 570
from the mid range are suitable for
1080p 60fps gaming in battlefield 5
using the ultra preset that's very
impressive considering how the game
looks using those quality settings then
a 1440p you only need an RX 580 for an
average above 60 FPS while high-end
cards like vega 64 and the RT x 2080 are
good for near 100 FPS or more on top of
this the game scales very well when
adjusting the in-game quality presets
gaining 45% more performance from
turning down a variety of settings is
well within the realms of possibility
and that brings even more enjoyable GPUs
up to a performance level that's
acceptable while maintaining decent
enough graphics ei dices frostbite
engine continues to impress in this
regard we are ignoring battlefield 5
DirectX ray-tracing implementation
here's that's less than impressive and
isn't particularly well optimised but
the good news is you don't need to play
with DX are unable to factory recommend
you don't and with just the regular
graphics options battlefield 5 looks
fantastic and it runs very well
this category runs out a list of more
technical awards for PC games released
in 2018 hey yeah we're a technical
Channel we love digging into games and
seeing how they run but we're also
interested in seeing how games evolve
and we do get a little excited when new
and innovative technical achievements
are brought to the table for this
technical innovation category we're
going to hone in on one specific title
and it might be a bit of a surprise to
some of you
that game is ubisoft's far cry 5 now you
might be wondering what aspect of Far
Cry 5 was all that innovative from a
technical standpoint I mean sure the
game was fine the graphics were good and
it ran pretty well but was there
anything out of the ordinary about the
game and well the answer comes down to
HDR this game impressed us for being the
first and one of the very few titles
available right now with proper decent
HDR support on PC this is the first game
I played on an HDR monitor that really
wowed me and highlighted where hgr
gaming is set to go in the future unlike
some of the older HDR titles far cry 5
shg our implementation is actually a
significant step up from its regular SDR
presentation and best of all it just
works flawlessly without any fiddling
we're giving this award to an HDR
implementation for a number of reasons
firstly in this title enabling HDR comes
at no performance cost all you need is
an HDR monitor and bam you can enable
HDR for basically a free visual
improvement it looks better and it runs
just as well as before secondly it works
with both AMD and NVIDIA GPUs right now
again if you have an external monitor it
will work with the majority of hardware
in gaming pcs today it's also clear that
a lot of work has gone into this hjm
implementation to make it great and
that's something I appreciate no YH
Jonas - in its infancy it's great to see
a company like Ubisoft setting an
example for others to follow the main
competitor for this category was direct
x-ray traced reflections in battlefield
5 but ultimately we decided not to award
race racing just yet while technically
impressive and also the future of gaming
DXR doesn't run particularly well right
now there are artifacting issues it's
only accessible to those who purchased
Nvidia r-tx graphics cards and in
battlefield 5 specifically it offers a
minor visual improvement for a
significant performance cost we think
hgr right now is a bit of a more
well-rounded technology and one that's
more ready for primetime but I think far
cry 5 showed us that this year
so far in this video we've discussed a
lot of triple-a titles but there were
also a bunch of excellent non triple-a
games released in 2018 so we couldn't
make this video without honoring at
least one of them one or a game we
personally have played return of the
aubergines sounds absolutely fascinating
from all accounts in case you didn't
know it's a mystery puzzle game where
your main objective is to discover the
fate of crew members on the odd Verdean
a vessel that appeared in port with
everyone on board dead you spend the
game piecing together what happened to
everyone and who killed who it's one I
can't wait to check out over the
Christmas break I'm not going to mention
any other story details because of
spoilers and it's not the sort of game
that you need a powerful PC to run well
here's a 3d game it's black and white
art style gives it a unique and
old-school visual style and if you don't
trust our communities recommendation and
let's be honest you guys are amazing you
know given us some great recommendations
return of the aubergine has been widely
acclaimed by critics if you pay much
attention to that stuff that's it for
this one both know what games you loved
in 2018 and whether you agree or
disagree with our picks there are lots
of other excellent games we played in
2018 that we didn't even touch on in
this video so check out the comet - I'm
sure a lot of other people will put in
some recommendations as always you can
