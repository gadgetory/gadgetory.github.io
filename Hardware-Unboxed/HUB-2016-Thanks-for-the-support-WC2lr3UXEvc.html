very last video for harbor unboxed in
2016 and I have to say what a year it
has been looking back I really don't
even know where to begin at the start of
the map and myself really had no
expectations for the channel looking
back it has been great to see the
content evolved especially as the
channel has grown it's crazy to look
back to where we started at the start of
the year back in January we had three
thousand three hundred subscribers and
honestly at the time I was pretty blown
away with that figure but now we've
moved on from that and we're just
knocking on the door actually I think by
now we've crossed over 45,000
subscribers which is for me mind blowing
and I know in the grand scheme of things
that still he makes our own box are very
small a baby channel if you will but for
us its massive and we're very happy to
be here along with the subscribers the
monthly views have also climbed quite
significantly back in January again we
were under 100,000 views for that month
and now we seem to be doing over 800,000
views and in fact it's quite exciting
because I think this will be our biggest
month yet as we edge pretty close to
that 1 million mark one of the most
surprising statistics I find and
probably the most tiring to think about
is the fact that somehow we managed to
average four videos per week for the
entire year and given that neither mad
nor myself worked on harbor unboxed you
know full-time capacity this year I'm
not quite sure how we managed to pull
that off anyway I won't go patting
myself on the back just yet there are a
heap of really exciting products coming
out next year and left work pretty hard
or even harder than we had been working
to cover them all so with that let's
take a quick look at some of the content
created this year
I
I'm really surprised by how much content
we managed to cram in 2016 that was
obviously very small snippet of it but
you get the idea a lot of hours have
been spent creating the content and I
guess a lot of the motivation to create
that content has come from you guys it
really has i mean that i can't believe
the support we really do get myself
although i've been working on the
channel for a long time now I've really
only been in front of the camera for
probably I think it's probably at two
months now it hasn't been much longer
than that if it has been and in that
time you guys have just been hugely
hugely supportive is someone that you
didn't really know I've just you know
jumped in in replacement format to help
out keep the channel going and yeah from
day one you guys were just really
supportive with me on the channel so I
can't thank you enough for that yeah I
really don't know how to put it into
words with that I'm not really sure how
I can repay you guys especially the guys
that come back view the channel on an
almost daily basis and engage that
really helps us out it's yeah usually
supportive for the channel I guess for
now we'll just keep creating the content
that you guys seem to enjoy there's
always some sort of massive CPU or GPU
comparison on the way those take quite a
bit of time to put together so we're
always working behind the scenes and
that well we're creating other content
that doesn't take quite as long like
reviews and shorter comparisons these
things like that so we'll keep creating
that and next year I'll also try to
collaborate with some of the other
companies that we work with and put
together some really cool giveaways like
some high-end GPU giveaways and stuff
like that we did a little bit of that
this year so that was great we gave away
quite a few computer cases with
thermaltake we gave away an RX for 80
with AMD and a few other things so yeah
hopefully we can get a lot more of that
going next year anyway in summary 2016
really was a great year for the channel
I personally had a lot of fun greater
than content and chatting with you guys
on a daily basis and I'm looking forward
to doing a lot more of it in 2007
in fact of 2017 is even half as good as
the 2016 the year we've just had that I
think will be an excellent shape for
next year's end of you video so I just
want to say thanks guys for sticking
with us I promise there's much more
content coming I'm your host Steve and
I'm looking forward to seeing you again
in 2017 very shortly
