I'm your host Matt and today we're going
to be taking a look at creatives new or
vana any 3 plus earphones creative on
highly revered in the audiophile
community as far as I know but they have
been trying to make a recent push
towards more high-end gear and the or
vana in iii+ is a product that we're
trying to do just that as well as earn
the respect of those that are orally
inclined a common downside to in-ear
headphones has been that they seem to
flatten out the center channel leading
to a fairly one-dimensional sound your
Vani in iii+ creative is aimed to create
detailed hires and a rich mid-range with
it's too precise balanced armature
tweeters and woofers there were some
comments about lacking low-end in the
original in-ear 3 so it'll be
interesting to see if much has changed
in the new any three plus a few other
big factors in choosing in ears has to
be comfort noise isolation and
durability so we're putting these
earphones to both long music and podcast
sessions in both quiet and loud
environments I use these earphones for
five days including gym workouts runs in
the car and just relaxing in bed and
I've got to say I thoroughly enjoyed
them listening fatigue was a non-issue
and I found them really comfortable to
wear you get a variety of soft rubber
tips and hardships so you've bound to
find a set that fits well I found that
any a seal and comfort was a bit better
with the soft rubber tips which is
pretty normal so that's what I went with
all around the build quality is high on
these earphones and they only actually
come in one color way which is this sort
of runs II almost purplish color which
does give a high quality look I like the
braided fabric cable cover and the four
point two foot cable comes with both a
mic and a remote the remote has a single
button as well as a volume slider which
I thought I might accidentally bump and
change my volume now and then but for me
it never happened
sound quality was impressive on the
in-ear 3 plus while the low certainly
won't boosted it seems a creative may
have addressed the complaints of users
that thought the loads were lacking a
little on the original in-ear threes
mids perform well as they did with the
first edition of the in-ear 3s and they
didn't sound crowded thanks to creative
precise balanced armature tweeters and
woofers
the hides are clear and clean sounding
as you'd expect from a set in this price
range they perform particularly well
with the volume turned up a little the
inner three is benefit here too from
their impressive noise isolations the
inner three plus is a good quality in
your system if you're looking to upgrade
from a cheap set to something with a
good quality sound but you want to stay
under $200 and these could be the way to
go
