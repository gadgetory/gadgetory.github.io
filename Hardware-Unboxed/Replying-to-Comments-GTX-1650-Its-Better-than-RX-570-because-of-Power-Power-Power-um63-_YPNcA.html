you missed it
gtx 1650 review went up a few days ago
and it's done really well for us
I guess Nvidia messing the media around
by withholding the driver seemed to
generate a bit of buzz for this one
anyway it resulted in about I think was
two thousand comments on that video
so we've got plenty to go over and yeah
I think that being the case we should
probably just jump straight into it and
get on with the first question because
this will be a rather long replying to
comments episode okay I'm gonna start
this one off on a bit of a positive note
good to do that every now and then we do
have a a nice comment here from Konza
also I happen to agree with what he says
not just because it's a nice comment
anyway he says these reviews are just as
important as reviews for good cards and
I really agree with that perhaps more
important and yeah kind of agree with
that as well it's good for all of us to
know not to buy 1650s at launch price so
great work Steve thank you very much so
yeah I completely agree with that the
1650s at the hundred fifty all US MSRP
good value and really it's all about the
price especially with these value these
cheap budget entry level entry ish level
cards so yeah I think it's really
important that you guys know that there
are better value options
16:50 is not a horrible performing card
it's not a bad card but it is in my
opinion pointless at the $150 price
point
others like gamers Nexus and well a lot
of others agree with me on that one it
does have its place and we'll discuss
that as we go through this video but
it's a very niche place so yeah anyway
we'll cover that later in the video be a
good good question that and I completely
agree it's really good to cover all
these products because I think by you
know just saying all the 16:50 is a
garbage product for whatever reason and
we're not going to bother with it
because it's not worth investing time
and I think that does our audience a
disservice so it's really important for
you guys to have that information there
whether you're buying at now or in six
months time because six months time the
price may not have changed but if it has
changed and you can at least see
benchmark numbers but we'll probably do
updated stuff by that anyway but anyway
important to come up moving on okay so
it was gonna be too long before we got
one of these 75-watt comments there were
a shipload of them and here is a random
example from Brandon why the bad press
timeout this is a 75 watt card 75 watts
it certainly got a use case as the most
powerful card to not need power beyond
from the motherboard the fact that no
tech reviews realize this show just how
clueless they ah yes gamers Nexus Harbor
unboxed and the rest of the tech review
community I just all about your dummies
okay so as noted in my GTX 1650 or
review it is very low powered and it's
extremely efficient that's all good and
well but it's not really the most
important thing for the majority of you
at least I don't I don't believe it is
and it's just one of many factors and
again I don't believe it's the most
important factor maybe it's a top three
consideration but for me price and
performance are without question the
more important aspects of any gaming
graphics card I'm also not entirely sure
why some of our audience are pretending
that a significant portion of the
audience are limited to PCIe slot power
delivery I myself have been combing the
internet for a system to use for a
benchmark system for comparing a few low
powered graphics cards and it really
hasn't been that easy to find one most
of them are just old Junkers that really
couldn't get the most out of a gtx 1050
let alone a 1650 and why the bloody hell
are you guys so keen to spend $150 us to
put a graphics card in a system that's
maybe worth $200 usually less anyway
I'll cover that one in a bit more depth
shortly I think for now we'll just move
on to the next question okay next
question is from anyway next question I
don't know man $450 it's not bad if it
runs games at 1080p 60fps ultra yeah
okay well firstly it didn't come close
to doing that and a few other titles
such as the division - far cry new dawn
just calls for a metro Exodus and
definitely shadow of the Tomb Raider and
most of those games
so it's important to note that the RX
570 did and it's also cheaper so that is
the main issue mate like a cheaper
anyway so we're not saying that the gtx
1650 can't deliver playable or even an
enjoyable gaming experience because well
it can you as you noted the performance
in some of the games is quite good we're
just saying that well there's a three
year old card that's faster and for what
has it been like the last year it's been
cheaper so yeah that's kind of the issue
there we have the rx 570 that's faster
and cheaper so that kind of makes the
GTX 1650 a tough sell for the vast
majority of our audience pretty much
anybody anybody upgrading a relatively
new computer or building a new computer
should avoid at the 1650 like the plague
because the rx 570 is just way better
value anyway we'll move on I won't get
stuck on any one question okay let's
move on to the next question here stop
comparing this to the RX 570 because
it's pointless to do so hmm hopefully he
goes on this car draws 115 what's less
on average is newer has been attempts
and is perfect for cheaper PS use or
some older systems you got two free
games with rx 570 question I think so
yeah okay great
you'll pay them as times goes by since
you'll spend more money on the bills
well okay there's actually quite a bit
to unpack here there's a few points to
this comment but anyway we'll start with
the first one and we'll work our way
through it so well start with the power
thing I've already started to address
this one but let's go a bit further with
it I think that's an irrelevant point
for 90 something percent of all gamers
firstly the RX 570 draws around twice as
much power so it's about 70 ish what's
more it's not a hundred fifteen Watts
again that is quite a significant
difference but it is up to 25 percent
faster and quite a few titles so
claiming that it's pointless to compare
the GTX 16 for
fifty-two the cheaper rs5 70 is just
well it's just insane
in my opinion I don't really know where
you're coming from on that one again
you're acting like everyone ever on our
audience has a ten-year-old PC with a
PSU that can't be upgraded or can't
support PCI Express graphics cards so
yeah yes it's me never stretch that one
not sure what else to say on it but I'm
surprised there's so many people that
are acting like everyone has a really
old om system that they have no other
option but to use a GTX 16:50 and again
I'm not even convinced that a GTX 16:50
will be much faster or any faster than
the GTX 1050 in these older systems it's
definitely something I want to look into
at a later date
then there was the bit yeah about the
you got two free games so I'm glad you
brought that one up because yeah the RX
570 does come with two rather popular
triple-a titles or I think your option
of get your choice of two out of three
tiles something like that I don't
usually bang on about that too much
because I don't think it applies to all
regions it's usually like a limited time
thing but it keeps getting stretched out
and goes on it is probably worth
mentioning more than I do and I've made
a few jokes about how the AMD fans
always get upset for me for not talking
about the free games bundle but it is an
impressive bundle and it really does
make this what makes the rx 570 a really
great value card especially if you want
to play those two games because they're
probably worth about what you'd pay for
the card so you're essentially getting
the car for free I don't like to look at
it that way I'll push it that way
because it won't apply for everyone but
anyway there is the two free games then
finally we have the power bill argument
and yet that kind of makes sense
depending on the region that you live in
so your cost of power and really how
much you game for example here in
Australia power is pretty expensive
I pay around 40 cents per kilowatt-hour
it's something like half that 20 cents
off-peak but the off-peak hours are very
brief and they're really off-peak anyway
if you average
one hour of gameplay per day I think I
worked it out with the RX 570 which uses
70 watts more than the GTX 1650 and it
work out to be $10 more per year to run
the radio and GPU so yeah again it
depends on how much you pay for power
and how often your game if you one hour
a day as an average is a lot because
while it's seven hours a week I mean
some of you probably laughing oh seven
hours a week that's nothing for me seven
hours a month is a pretty good month for
me on gaming but I'm busy with work and
a family and whatnot so that wasn't the
case in my early 20s Tim probably gets
in a lot more gaming than I do even
though he seems to do a lot of work as
well but anyway getting sidetracked one
hour a day amounts to a ten dollar
difference if you pay quite a bit for
electricity so yeah it's really up to
you guys to determine how significant
that is in two or three years time you
will have broken even in the cost
between the RX 5 7 in the GTX 1650 so
yeah and yeah given that formula or well
how that works in my region so that is
one hour per day equaling 10 dollars per
year you can probably calculate that my
rather expensive cost of power what 2
hours would equate to 3 hours and so on
so you know I think once for me
personally if I started doing 3 hours of
gaming a day on average the power
savings of the GTX 16:50 do become quite
significant but remember the RX 570 is
often up to 20% faster so there's also
that's it's just not a simple power
thing it's one aspect to take into
consideration but as I said earlier for
me it's a top-three thing ranking 3rd
and yeah the RX 570 it's 3 years old so
again I know I've already said this but
it's a three year old product so if
you're coming to market with a new
product to compete with a three year old
product you kind of need more than just
to be able to justify that it's for
niche pcs or it makes your power bill
less you need you need something more
compelling than that when you bring a
new product to market it has to be
better in terms of either performance or
cost or whatever but it can't just be
more efficient so next question I found
up being to ranty or all over the place
with this reply no comment so I don't
really script that much of this I just
have a few notes to go off and yeah
sometimes I get a little bit carried
away with answering the questions or
addressing the comments rather anyway I
like this observation by dumper Pro
hopefully that's correct there
he says bit wit got 28 to 32 FPS and
shut off the Tomb Raider at 1080p ultra
but then again he tested on an i5 3450
but that's a huge difference yeah that
is a big difference and in that section
of the game the GTX 1650 without a CPU
bottleneck should be averaging around 50
fps and that makes it 50% faster than
what Kyle showed in his video by the way
that was a really cool video by Kyle he
sort of took a different approach to
checking out the 1650 I really enjoyed
the video myself he did test the 1650 in
a case with a 6 pin PCI power connector
but not gonna blame Carly for that one
as I said I've been combing the internet
looking for a system that makes sense to
test the 1650 and to validate the
argument that so many well I mean off
their Nvidia fans but people are making
and I'm having a lot of trouble doing it
yeah really cool video there by Carl I
would have loved to see a follow-up
video where he test something like the
1050 TI in the RX 570 I'll probably end
up doing that video myself but it'd be
good to have someone else do it as well
but anyway really cool video by Kyle and
I will link it in the description below
because it's definitely worth checking
out so we did learn a few things from
Kyle's video or at least a few of my
hunches were somewhat proven so if
you're installing a gtx 1650 in an older
system there's a very good chance in
modern titles and you might be running
anywhere near the full potential of the
GPU now Kyle was consistently seeing GP
utilization below 90% often down around
70% sometimes even lower and that was in
the tiles that he tested so some new
tiles some not new titles but yeah he's
using a locked Ivy Bridge core i5 which
a lot of people think hey that's a
that's a good gaming processor and it's
by no means terrible but it simply
couldn't process the information fast
enough
that left the GPU waiting before I could
render the next frame and it's also
probably not the best showing of an
average core i5 because those om systems
generally don't have the lowest latency
highest frequency memory either so yeah
not not a great showing therefore the
core i5 so my point is in these older
systems the GTX 1650 won't be much of an
upgrade over something like a GTX 1050
I'll perhaps even at rx 560 so yeah
interesting one that and again I don't
really understand the argument or
understand why people would be spending
$150 us on a graphics card for these old
rigs like it just doesn't make sense to
me
for me if you were going to buy a new
graphics card something like a 4
gigabyte rx 560 for $100 that would
probably be a better option and work
well it would work just as well I think
or ideally I think the best way to go
about an old secondhand system or just a
really dated system that sort of
qualifies as being secondhand well a
secondhand graphics card for around $50
that would probably work well so yeah I
don't know why you'd be putting a new
graphics card in a decade old PC again
especially one that costs a hundred and
fifty dollars u.s. and just finally on
this comment another thing that I've
seen pop up quite a bit is the ease of
install argument I've seen this quite a
few times now the gtx 1650 just slots
into the system no need for power supply
changes or upgrades or whatever or
connecting anything you just slot that
thing in tighten up the screw and away
you go so that's the argument but as
Kyle proved in his video that is often
far from the truth
just to get the 1650 up and running in
his system he had to install the latest
bias where to download and install the
latest bios and really that is often
much riskier and harder than upgrading a
power supply so yeah it's not always as
easy as it seems
anyway we'll move on to the next one
okay next comment here is from down
phoenix so if it's a horrible product
what graphics card would you recommend
for a low power setup because from the
benchmarks i've seen it seems to quite
handily be the most power
or GPU that doesn't require extra power
okay so as I was just saying most of
these sorry in these older systems a GTX
what was it a 1050 or an rx 560 that
will not only be cheaper but they
probably should deliver a similar or the
same level of performance due to heavy
CPU bottlenecking
and yeah I'm just sort of assuming that
I have done a lot of a testing on this
sort of stuff in the past so I have a
reasonable idea of what I'm talking
about but I will have some hard evidence
of this in the near future because I
have ordered an older system not crazy
old like I think it's another ivy bridge
or maybe it's even a house well it's a
locked core i5 and it's got eight
gigabytes of memory it was like 350
Ozzie dollars anyway I've purchased that
it's on the way I'll have a video up as
soon as I can and we'll be comparing all
these graphics cards in that system and
yeah we'll know then what's what again
what I can tell you is that there isn't
a single use case where the gtx 1650
makes an ounce of sense when building a
new PC or even upgrading a decent PC
made in the last five years or so okay
next comment I think you are under
estimating the importance for many and
having a quieter PC and a lower power
consumption okay so this is another
interesting point
the thing about operating volume no base
model 1650 that I'm aware of so that is
the hundred and fifty dollar models none
of them are particularly impressive when
it comes to operating volume for example
there no quieter than your average
rx 570 or really any other aib graphics
card for that matter and this is because
you aren't getting the same cooler that
comes on an RX 5 7 or gtx 1660 TI or any
of the other more expensive graphics
cards getting a cooler that's ready to
dissipate 75 watts i've already shown
how light the base model 1650s are they
have tiny aluminium coolers and budget
power delivery components on board
I've got there's one there so there's an
expensive 1650 but I think it's $180 and
there's $150 model anyway I might throw
up some b-roll in a murmur
just to show you the difference but the
cooler on the base models is extremely
wimpy it's very small
but it does the job because it's only
putting out well it only has to deal
with 75 watts but they're not sticking
on you hundred and fifty watt or bigger
coolers that you get on the higher-end
graphics cards because it costs more
money to do so and cuts into margins and
if you do get a 1650 with a nice be
quiet cooler well you're paying silly
money for and it doesn't make sense so
yeah you're not really getting a quiet
graphics card you're just getting out
yeah well it is quiet but it's not
quieter than other graphics cards with
appropriate coolers finally I just like
to add that the margins for AI bees so
that should gigabytes seuss MSI those
guys their margins on the GTX 1650s are
much higher than that of the RX 5 70s as
the 570s require a cooler ready to
dissipate 150 watts along with
higher-quality verum components to
handle all that extra load so for the
end user the consumer you guys the only
thing you'll really notice are those
extra frames quick comment here from
Evan lfg what is that nuclear Factory
besides you this thing my coffee Ripper
build yeah that's whatever ok next
comment here is from go Webb's actually
I disagree ok
the 1650 is worth buying for someone
with a low wattage power supply ok yeah
over time it will be worth it because it
will save on power sort of address that
one already
hmm the reason why in video and other
part makers will stop giving you samples
and drivers is wait for it it's what we
good
you continue bad-mouthing their products
I won't use anyone that mouths my
product good luck destroying your
channel lull
well anyway why did I put that comment
in there I think we'll just move on
ok we got another comment let's hope
this one's a little more intelligent
this existence of this card isn't
pointless they are great for home
theater PC use not every purchase of a
GPU will utilize them for FPS gaming
there are low-power don't need
additional cables due to lack of power
connect
that comes in mini model fast than 1052
I support for HEV C etc I recently got a
1050 TI and it works very well at video
processing and format via even upscaling
movies to 4k I would have bought that
1650 if I had been following in video
news well kind of a funny thing about
that one if you have been following the
video news you'd know that 1650 won't
really be any upgrade over your 1050 Ti
for encoding tasks and video didn't
include the churring encoder in the 1650
so bit of an odd choice on that one I
don't think anyone's really worked out
why apart from maybe it's cheaper to use
the one they did so they've gone with
the older Volta encoder which is
basically the same thing we saw in
Pascal just with added support for
higher bitrate vp9 decoding so yeah
again for your use case it is kind of
pointless it's a more expensive version
of what you already have so was that
worth waiting three years for okay so we
must be getting to some good comments by
now it's par say that as I just read the
start of this one alright let's get into
this title slash thumbnail just confirms
the bias of this channel in my opinion
you're in the same pocket as adored TV
and all other Hale amv channels well Jim
and I have shared the same bucket in the
past and it didn't end too well for the
bucket seriously though I just love that
the title and thumbnail triggered this
response honestly yeah I mean you should
probably go watch my Hale AMD Radeon 7
and rx 590 reviews it's all I'm gonna
say on that one but man I've got like a
dozen more comments but I feel like we
probably addressed just about everything
we can at this point so yeah I just want
to get back to benchmarking so I think
we'll wrap this video up I have
purchased an older system as about to
say a new system but it'll be used for
me but it's a very old system again it
was thrown a few dollars Ozzy it's a
Dell Optiplex
I think it's a 30 20 it's a desktop
system it's got a Core i5 I think for
memory it's a 4590 but I know it has no
PCIe power so yeah that'll be a good
candidate for testing what we need - it
does have a custom motherboard as well
so you can't just drop in an ATX power
supply so yeah it's really the perfect
system to prove this theory that I
believe something like a gtx 1050 - RI
RX 560 will be quite comparable to a
1650 in that system
but yeah anyway we'll look into it even
if they're not they're not gonna be
miles slower and I really don't think

on the channel in the next week or two
so that'll be worth keeping an eye out
for anyway that'll do it for this reply

too ran T and - all over the place

structure this that well it's just yeah
