unbox video we're back at it again with
a look at hyper-threading at this time
the focus will be on the core i3 range
for those of you who missed it last
month I investigated how much of an
impact hyper-threading has on the core
i7 processors in today's games
essentially with hyper-threading
disabled a core i7 quad core becomes
pretty much a Core i5 processor and I
was interested to see how much this
impacted performance using graphics
cards such as the gtx 1070 1080 and
titan XP as many of you know Intel's
more affordable more mainstream core i3
processor series also takes advantage of
hyper threading in my previous video I
mentioned this and I also alluded to the
fact that hyper threading is extremely
useful on a core i3 processor and
therefore didn't test it or included in
that video with the focus being mostly
on the core i7 I did things this way
because I wanted to see how much hyper
threading benefit a quad core processor
and if games could really take advantage
of those eight threads but as it turns
out doing so kind of backfired and a lot
of you guys asked me to rerun the tests
using a core i3 processor by disabling
hyper threading on a core i3 you
essentially end up with a dual core
Pentium processor and this is the reason
the core i3 range seems to cup a lot of
flak from some gamers even though we
think it's still very capable anyway
happy to oblige
I've taken a core i3 6100 processor
which comes clocked at 3.7 gigahertz and
benchmarked it with and without hyper
threading enabled this time around the
Titan XP and GD X 1080 have been dropped
I don't think they were appropriate for
testing budget processors heading up the
high-end task force is the gtx 1070
followed by the gtx 1060 and then
finally the most suitable GPU the 1050
Ti has also been included for testing
we've used a basic system comprised of a
H 110 motherboard and eight gigabytes of
ddr4 2133 memory I was tempted to go
with a 16 gigabyte kit but in the end I
don't really think it will impact
performance and this configuration is
probably more realistic of course if you
were going to run a gtx 10cm
you would use a 16 gigabyte kit but this
GPU has been used more to show an
extreme scenario rather than a realistic
one in total I've tested with six games
all of which are quite new I didn't have
time to update the results using
watchdogs - and that's a game I would
have liked to include given his extreme
demands on the CPU still I'm sure
there'll be numerous opportunities to
test with that game in the future right
so with the testing notes out of the way
let's get to the good stuff starting
with the oldest game used overwatch we
find some very interesting results let's
start from the bottom and work our way
up using the gtx 1050 TI the core i3
6100 averaged a hundred and twelve FPS
with a minimum of 85 FPS a very nice
result disabling hyper threading reduced
the average framerate by 17% while the
minimum took a massive 32% hit moving to
the gtx 1060 the story develops further
here the average frame rate increased by
26% from the 1050 Ti and we saw a
similar gain for the minimum however
disabling hyper threading resulted in
the same performance seen when using the
1050 Ti under the same conditions this
then clearly illustrates a CPU
bottleneck a rather severe one that is
likely limiting the performance of even
the 1050 Ti moving to the gtx 1070 we
see a mere 14% increase in average
framerate from the 1060 and just 9%
increase for the minimum frame rate
clearly even with hyper-threading
support the core i3 processor isn't fast
enough to take full advantage of a gtx
1070 and well I'm sure that surprises
no-one also unsurprising is the fact
that we've hyper threading disabled we
find the same average framerate cap of
96 FPS interestingly although f1 2016
kept our core i7 6700 K with hyper
threading enabled constantly loaded
between 50 and 80% it doesn't seem to
benefit from hyper threading on a core
i3 processor whereas the gtx 1060
averaged 77 FPS use in the core i7 6700k
with hyper threading disabled in our
previous tests here the same GPU and the
manage 53 FPS when paired with the core
i3 6100 the minimum frame rate has also
been halved
although hyper threading did
consistently boost performance we were
only looking at an increase of
one two three FPS which I have to admit
surprised me that said it was only with
the Titan XP at the core i7 6700k showed
a benefit at all from hyper-threading in
this title in an interesting twist we
find quite the opposite when testing
with civilization 6 though admittedly
these results are more what I was
expecting to find previously with the
core i7 processor hyper threading only
offered a few FPS boost in this title
this was also the case for the core i3
6100 when testing with the gtx 1050 Ti
clearly we're seeing a bottleneck here
however once we move to the more
powerful gtx 1060 things start to change
and hyper threading afforded to the core
i3 processor a 23% increase to the
minimum and average frame rate moving to
the gtx 1070 we are now completely
cpu-bound and as a result the 1070 was
no faster than the 1060 even with hyper
threading enabled Gears of War 4 likes
to make the CPU hurt the 67 are ok with
hyper threading enabled for example was
utilized by as much as 95% though for
the most part utilization sat at 70%
which is still very high an eighth
threaded processor ok so starting from
the bottom with the GTX 1050 - we see
the hyper threading offers a small
performance bump of 9% here certainly
very welcome when the minimum frame
rates are in the 30s now when we move to
the gtx 1060 things get a little crazy
with hyper threading disabled we find a
massive bottleneck on the dual-core
processor limiting the gtx 1060 to 1050
Ti like performance however with hyper
threading enabled the core i3 6100 and
it's 1060 partner race await on average
of 75 FPS with a 50 FPS minimum that's a
47% increase for the average frame rate
from the 1050 Ti and a 28% increase for
the minimum frame rate what's more is
this means hyper threading is providing
an unlikely 56 percent performance boost
for the core i3 6100 when paired with
the gtx 1060 still 75 FPS was the end of
the road for the core i3 processor is
the gtx 1070 allowed it to go no faster
for those wondering the core i7 6700k
pushed the gtx 1070 to an average of 116
FPS with a minimum of 98 FPS so 55%
faster or almost
100% faster if you look at the minimums
now for the battlefield 1 results please
note these results are not directly
comparable with those previously
recorded using the core i7 6700k
processor as I did test a different
section of the game here we see that
without its hyper threading support the
core i3 6100 is severely crippled as the
average frame rate with the gtx 1050 TI
dropped from 60 fps
down to just 38 fps the hit to the
minimum frame rate was even greater
dropping almost 50% of its original
performance so with the loli 1050 Ti
this means we saw an insane 92% increase
in performance with hyper-threading
enabled on the core i3 processor this
mid-range GPU really is unable to do
much better than the 1052 AI without
hyper trading support however enabling
hyper threading boosted the average and
minimum frame rates by over 100%
obviously hyper trading doesn't really
offer those kinds of performance gains
under normal circumstances the issue
here being that the game just doesn't
run properly with only two threads
available choking the processor to the
point where it's performing much worse
than expected the situation is much the
same when using the gtx 1070 though even
with hyper-threading support the core i3
processor is unable to fully utilize
this graphics card the 1070 was seen to
be just 13 percent faster than 1060 when
comparing the average frame rate and
just three percent faster for the
minimum lastly we have total war
Warhammer and this should provide some
interesting and possibly different
results given that this is the only
DirectX 12 game tested using the core i7
6700 K in our previous tests we saw a
little difference between running the
quad core processor with or without
hyper threading as you can see this was
also the case with the core i3 6100 when
using the geforce gtx 1050 TI graphics
card just one extra frame was rendered
with hyper threading enabled with the
gtx 1060 installed we saw a 10% increase
in average frame rate with hyper
threading enabled though the minimum was
only boosted by 4% once we reached the
gtx 1070 you can see without the aid of
hyper threading we hit a wall at around
52 FPS enabling hyper threading boosted
performance further though again this
GPU is clearly just too powerful to be
utilized properly by a core i3 processor
for those wondering the 6700
using the 1070 pushed over 110 FPS well
that was for the most part pretty much
what we were expecting to find as I said
in the previous video hyper-threading
really does work wonders for the core i3
processors games such as battlefield one
go from almost unplayable without hyper
threading to delivering around 60 FPS or
more with hyper threading it's also
worth noting that other games such as
overwatch which do take advantage of the
core i3 hyper threading support don't
necessarily need it for playable
performance here we saw with hyper
threading disabled still about 60 FPS
and that was with the GTX 1050 Ti using
the ultra quality preset then you have
titles such as titanfall 2 which have a
strict door policy preventing dual cores
from entering sorry buddy you're out of
here not enough cause that was a dead
processor guys so you can relax I said
relax
stop hitting for the comments box anyway
where was I
yes so it has been apparent for some
time now that the life of a dual core
processor is running out and hyper
threading really does help out the core
i3 range here by forwarding it for
threads priced at 125 dollars a US or
150 ozzie the core i3 6100 is a perfect
pairing for a budget graphics card such
as the gtx 1050 Ti or Radeon rx 460 or
the standard 1050 budget graphics cards
you guys get the idea the gtx 1060 cards
just a little bit too fast we feel
though for the most part we're right on
the edge here beyond that though you'll
want a Core i5 processor particularly if
you play games such as battlefield 1
Gears of War 4 or by the looks of it
then you watch dogs to game well that
wraps this one up you guys asked for
core i3 testing so I hope you enjoyed it
I'm your host Steve I'll catch you guys
