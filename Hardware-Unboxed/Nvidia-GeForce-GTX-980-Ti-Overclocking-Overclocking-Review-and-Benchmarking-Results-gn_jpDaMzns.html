I'm Harris Matt and today we're going to
overclock the GeForce GTX 980 TI
reference card last week we got our
first look at in videos new geforce gtx
980 TI the new high-end must have GPU
the 980 TI proves you deliver type next
like performance at a considerably
cheaper price as we pointed out this
makes the type next somewhat pointless
another advantage that 980 TI has over
the tight next is the will be
custom-built cards from in videos board
partners this is something that didn't
allow with the type next this means
companies such as gigabyte asus EVGA and
so on can develop their own 980 TI
creations this is important because
while the Nvidia reference cool looks
pretty cool it isn't the most effective
design for keeping the 980 TI or tight
next cool to keep the operating volume
down the fan speed stays quite low even
under heavy gaming and this makes the
card run pretty hot this is largely why
the gtx 980 TI was only a few percent
slower than the type next rather than
the eight percent that it should have
been both cards hit a thermal throttle
at 84 degrees and at that limit the 980
TI i was able to hold a higher boost
clock speed with its fewer cuda cores
unfortunately we're yet to get our hands
on a production card with improved
cooling from one of them videos partners
which could further close the gap
between the 980 TI and the type next
while we wait for a production card we
have had some time to tinker with the
980 TI reference card and conduct some
overclocking experiments despite hitting
the 84 degrees thermal limit quite
quickly with the default clock
frequencies we have had a lot of success
overclocking the 980 TI with only minor
voltage adjustments we were able to
boost the base core frequency from a
thousand megahertz to twelve hundred and
seventy megahertz a nice twenty-seven
percent increase so gddr5 memory also
went from 1752 megahertz to 19
mega hertz or 7.6 gigahertz ddr we ended
up adding 85 million volts and
increasing the power limit to one
hundred and ten percent now I'm sure
you're all wondering what kind of impact
this hat on performance so let me show
you in Crysis 3 we were able to get 33
frames per second three more than the
type next and five more than the non
overclocks 980 TI in battlefield 4 we
managed an impressive 51 frames 7 frames
more than the type necks and nine more
than the 980 TI and its regular
configuration in battlefield hardline
the overclocks nine NDT i was again
faster than both the Titan X and the
regular 980 TI by six frames and nine
frames respectively in dying light our
overclock ti was leader of the pack with
45 frames per second the type next
wasn't far behind with 42 frames per
second and the regular 980 TI got 38 in
The Witcher 3 our overclocked card was
again quicker than the Titan X by four
frames per second and six frames per
second faster than the nine overclocked
980 TI in Grand Theft Auto 5 or
overclocks 980 TI was best in the field
with 52 frames per second this was five
frames per second faster than the Titan
X and eight frames per second faster
than a non overclocked card I think it's
fair to say that overclocking the 980 TI
is very much worth it as we were easily
able to exceed the performance of the
Titan acts on average gamers can expect
a huge twenty percent increase in
performance over the non overclocked
card and we expect when the production
cards come with their improved cooling
that overclocking will be even more
beneficial this has been Matt from
