dancing the final winners of up grab my
PC please season one over the past three
months we've looked at 50 computers and
upgraded to them based on guidance from
you the viewers the final winner of
season one is JC from the us with these
smart looking mini ITX rigged by winning
he'll now be an upgrade from that AMD
APU and a Radeon HD 6870 graphics card
that it currently has two rows and five
processor with the geforce gtx 1050 Ti
so congratulations to JC on winning the
final episode the $500 us upgrade
package includes not just the Rison v
1400 processor and geforce gtx 1050 - a
graphics card but also a shiny new X 370
motherboard with eight gigabytes of ddr4
memory also taking home a cool prize is
SVD Killswitch for voting and commenting
on last week's episode and they're
taking home a risin 5 1500 X and this is
now the 10th viewer to walk away with a
prize in total this season tech spot in
collaboration with harbour and box has
given away $5,000 u.s. worth of PC
upgrades and with the help of our
partners well over $2000 u.s. worth of
prizes for the viewers it's been a fun
season and we keen to do it all over
again
right now we're targeting February next
year to start season 2 we will be
kicking that off with a look back at all
the winners from this season and see how
they got them with all their upgrades
for those of you who've already
submitted your PC well you don't have to
do that all over again for season 2
that's it there I strongly recommend you
go back and update your photos and
provide the best photos you can really
is all about the photos and you can
reply to the existing post that you've
already made and your private thread
there and just update photos there or
you can even edit the original
submission however you want to do it but
you can go back to that original thread
please update the photos we have had
over 1400 submissions so far and next
season will be picking just 50 of the
best again photos really are everything
without good quality photos you simply
won't be picked unfortunately that is
the situation looking at we have to work
with now I can almost guarantee that if
you do provide high quality photos that
will ensure that your PC makes it onto
season who
anyway as we get closer to starting
season 2
we'll release another video containing
all the important information any
changes or tweaks that we may have made
for season 2 well that's gonna wrap up
season 1 I hope you guys enjoyed it
taking out this video I'll show all 10
submissions that won this season I'm a
host Steve see you next time crockie
we're back in Australia this time with
Hayden and his CAD box I promise I'll
never do that again for the remainder of
this video right ok down the business so
Hayden built this rig with his
stepfather almost four years ago now
with the intention of using it for CAD
assignments as he is a student of course
like most of us he does enjoy the odd
gaming session from time to time and he
mostly plays a europa for factorio and
civilization 6 the problem is the core
i5 4670 is getting hammered with the CAD
work it takes hours to complete short
three-minute renders so we definitely
need some more CPU firepower
ideally I'd love to suggest something
like the Rison 7 1700 but that's just
not going to fit within our budget
unfortunately and the idea of something
like a thread Ripper build would no
doubt have Hayden throw f---ing at the
mouth but again not realistic for our
budget anyway getting back to reality
once again I'm going to recommend the
Rison 5 1600 with its 6 cores and 12
threads it will be ideal for the CAD
work strap that on the be 350
motherboard with 8 gigabytes of ddr4
memory and we're set once memory prices
do settle down Hayden might want to add
another 8 gigabytes and then the system
would be unstoppable for his CAD work
Hayden says he's also keen to give
overclocking a shot so I suggest
throwing in the cryo rig m9 a fellow
Aussie Braden is rockin along with Olema
cold and medium PC from his sister many
years ago the only upgrade made since
receiving the PC includes a gtx 660 and
a larger 500 gigabyte hard drive short
of that though Brayton hasn't had the
funds for any big upgrades it sounds
like Braden does a little bit of work in
light works but mostly likes to play
games such as rocket League overwatch in
csgo and while very fun popular games I
they're mostly played out of necessity
as they aren't the most demanding titles
right so for our younger viewers out
there the Core 2 Duo 8600 was a high-end
flagship dual-core processor released
way back in 2008 by Intel and at the
time it was a bit special today though
it runs rocket League like bicycle
League and no matter how hard at pedals
with just 2 gigabytes of RAM it's going
to be a jerky ride because we're coming
from so far back I'm gonna recommend the
pentium g 45 64 this one opposed to rise
and 3 in terms of pricing it's much the
same but we're going about things a
little differently for this one now you
might be confused by the relatively high
end Zed 270 boy from asrock but the idea
here is to provide Braeden with a set of
components that will allow him to make
further upgrades in the future dropping
in a Core i5 or a core i7 perhaps down
the track will give this system a new
lease on life
meanwhile the GTX 1050 is a massive
upgrade from the gtx 660 and that pretty
much goes without saying
and finally the thought of brain and
running this newly refurbished system on
an old 500 gigabyte hard drive was just
too much for me so we're putting down
the angle grinder and getting out
Kingston's a 400 which will make for a
super snappy boot drive with this
upgrade Braden can certainly enjoy some
new games first up we have an old Sandy
Bridge Core i5 PC from Aki which has
been named a Kart ski I hope I said that
right anyway it was built back in 2011
with just four gigabytes of RAM and the
pokey little geforce GT 430 since then a
few difficult upgrades have been made a
key received the GeForce GTX 480 is a
hand-me-down from a relative so that was
a decent step up from the GT 430
however the Fermi based graphics card is
physically quite long as a result the
hack saw came out in the three and a
half inch drive bay got the chop so with
a bit of violence that problem was
solved quite quickly the next problem as
many of you know Fermi is a hot item and
with limited case cooling a key had to
whack in a 120 millimeter fan on the
side of the case to feed in some fresh
air the GTX 480 also slayed the old
power supply so to solve that
the EVGA supernova 750 g2 was dropped in
I'd normally say that's extreme overkill
but then we are talking about a GTX 480
after all upgrading the memory was no
easy task either as it was discovered
that the second dim slot on the h 61
motherboard ended up being dead so a key
had to sell the 4 gigabyte sticks and by
a single aching about module 4 single
channel operation as a student a key
uses the PC for projects but like most
of us also enjoys the odd game
apparently stuttering is a serious
problem for titles such as Just Cause 3
and Resident Evil 7 using low to medium
quality settings so let's see what we
can do about that since we are dealing
with a locked core i5 CPU here a
platform upgrade really is in order
therefore I'm going to propose the
horizon 5 1400 on a gigabyte be 315
motherboard with 8 gigabytes of memory
this leaves us with enough cash to buy
either a new SSD or a case sadly though
there either
enough money left over to get something
like a gtx 1050 so we'll have to stick
with that GTX 480 for now a key can
tackle that at a later date for me the
case really is a sad affair and I can't
imagine putting any new hardware into
that thing so I've picked out the
fractal design focus Mini G this is a
smart combo that will not just look
great but it'll also work very well last
but not least we have the death star and
if we're lucky with the help of the
force we can fire two proton torpedoes
into the am3+ socket and end it Gabriel
built the system about a year ago he
says and I've really got no idea what
his excuses if he'd been following the
channel or reading the content over on
tech spot we could have saved him a lot
of heartache anyway Gabriel says it was
meant to be more of a workstation slash
mid-range gaming PC but today it's
really just no longer cutting it games
such as battlefront Skyrim and
battlefield 4 they play ok says but more
modern titles are really becoming an
issue the FX 6300 and gtx 1050 TI combo
is really going to struggle at 1080p
with modern games so we really do have
to focus the budget on getting a new CPU
as well as a GPU ID
I would have life to upgrade the raid
max power supply but that I'll just have
to do for now
thankfully the upgraded PC probably will
draw less power than what the FX system
is using currently Gabriel already has
an SSD so we can leave the storage alone
so I propose we opt for the horizon 5
1400 on the asrock a be 350 pro 4 with 8
gigabytes of ddr4 memory then to really
improve the gaming experience we'll
ditch the gtx 750ti in favor of the gtx
1050 - i and that right there is a big
step up indeed the 1050 Ti is capable of
tackling all the latest titles at 1080p
using reasonably good quality settings
so Gabriel won't know himself next up we
have a rather bland looking system from
Vince this looks very much like
something you would find in an office
type setting and frankly that's probably
where it belongs
sadly Vince is trying a game on this
thing and he says he's having very
little fun doing so right now he's
playing csgo using low quality settings
at low frame rates and it's much the
same with other games he likes to play
such as rust and Far Cry 3 like the a
1050 100k that we looked at previously
the a 1070 700 K only has a 384 stream
processor enabled radeon GPU so it's
extremely weak by today's standards as
usual we do only have a $500 us budget
so I'm gonna have to stretch it pretty
big for this one when on a budget go
rise and throw I always say and that's
been a saying for like 2 months now
anyway the r3 1200 on the asrock a B 350
and with a gigabytes of ddr4 will work a
treat they're napping Vince's game will
be the geforce gtx 1063 gigabyte and
that will be perfect for his low res
monitor then making sure the upgrade
doesn't go up in smoke
I recommend the EVGA 500 b1 it's a 500
watt bronze certified power supply and
that will see us hit the $500 us budget
right on the nose
all right diving until we have Andrews
PC which is dubbed jus retirement makes
sense the 11 year old q 6600 has seen
better days
that GeForce GTX 1060 is probably not
really pulling its weight either
anyway the system in its current form or
there abouts was built five years ago
from secondhand parts with the exception
of the graphics card the lovely and very
retro coolermaster wave master has seen
three builds now it's started life with
an Athlon 3500 then an Athlon 64 x2 4200
plus then an Athlon 64 x2 5400 before
going blue with the q 6600 Andrew now
uses the system for image and video
editing but of course enjoys the odd
games such as our factor 2 Borderlands
and rollercoaster tycoon
I'm sure it also like to enjoy some new
or more demanding games as well could he
actually play them the only requirement
here being that we do keep the wave
master case and honestly I wouldn't dare
a place such an old beauty what I will
do though is replace that crusty old LGA
775 platform we have at most 380 pounds
to play with so we will be stretching
the budget to the max on this one the
best option right now for Andrews needs
would be the risin 5 1600 on the Isuzu
prime B 350 plus we thank you bytes of
ddr4 I'd love to upgrade the graphics
card as well but rather than up for a
lower-end Verizon CP I feel like going
all-in on the r5 1600 will pay off for
that image and particularly video
editing
should Andrew win he can always upgrade
to something like a GTX 1060 in the
future and that'll set him up nicely for
gaming now this PC by hallam is creative
very creative indeed he says that
started life as his grandmother's
computer back in 2010 and with a core i5
7500 and a huge error a cool case
eventually grandma didn't need the
system anymore so she handed it off to
her grandson he'll in 2015 as a birthday
gift grandmas are the best to hunt they
Pels made a number of upgrades over the
years and last year the aro cool knife
Fox's he's a nicknamed it cut him for
the last time sick of getting cut by the
case every time he went in there to do
some cleaning or whatever else he hacked
it up and just kept the motherboard tray
too
right the thing you see before you what
he's basically made here is an open air
test bed out of timber and the leftover
motherboard tray and i have to say i
absolutely love it
hell is a robotic engineer student in
the future he would like to custom
design and fabricate his own small
form-factor micro ATX case that's pretty
cool
speaking of which he does do a lot of
cad work with the pc and this really is
its primary function though he does
enjoy playing games as well right now he
says he's playing overwatch heavily
modified Skyrim se and World of Warcraft
Legion his dream PC would be based on a
thread Ripper CPU but realistically he's
hoping for our Aizen 5 or 7 upgrade in
the near future so this is a pretty
obvious upgrade though we will be again
using every last dollar we have
available the r5 1600 is the most
expensive Rison cpu we can afford with
our $500 u.s. budget which converted to
Australian dollars gives us 645 in
addition to the r5 1600 that's going to
get us the gigabyte a B 350 M d3h with
16 gigabytes of memory should hal win
his cad life's going to become a heck of
a lot more enjoyable last but certainly
not least we have Scott's white knight
which despite the specs was actually
built very recently using hand-me-down
parts from his friends this is kind of
nice in Scotts words he had this to say
inspired by the content found in harbor
unboxed I thought I would give it a go
myself despite all my friends offering
to build it for me it was probably the
single most nerve-racking experience
I've ever gone through however I was
exhilarated by the prospect that it
would be something many people have
never done that I constructed all by
myself overall he's been quite happy
with the system using it mainly to play
csgo the only issue being that he would
love to play pub G and sadly it just
doesn't run very well on the current CPU
and GPU combo I know that game in
particular hates one gigabyte graphics
cards even with the low quality settings
the Radeon HD 77 90 is probably the
biggest issue here that said I can't
leave a man behind no less in a
slow-moving bulldozer
so the FX CPU has to go as well
upgrading the CPU and GPU on this budget
are $500 u.s. budget is go
to be very tight especially what's
converted into pounds still this does
allow us to pick up a horizon 514
hundred and m/s I'd be 350 M gaming pro
at gigabytes of ddr4 memory and a
GeForce GTX 1052 gigabyte graphics card
that will completely eat up our budget
every last dollar or pound but it
certainly will be enough for Scott to
enjoy pub G at 1080p
last but not least we have Joshua's
prowl a humble old Core 2 quad system
that I just had to include because these
photos are so nice there you go guys pro
tip for season 2 of upgrade my PC please
it's all about them photos anyway handy
camerawork aside
Joshua's certainly needs a few upgrades
Joshua sounds like a real PC part
scavenger like he could almost be Brian
from tech yes city's brother no offence
mate
he says he's that guy who collects old
used and unwanted parts from his friends
and puts them in his iron PC as a result
in 2017 this is what he's dealing with
and things look as though they're
probably moving quite slowly
despite the pcs age you still enjoy his
games such as praying he also does a lot
of video editing work in Premiere
so while Joshua would like to enjoy the
latest and greatest games he's focus
really is on video editing work given
the GeForce GTX 970 is still very
capable especially at 1080p we don't
really need to allocate any of our
budget here instead we're going to be
focusing entirely on rendering power and
that means securing the mighty AMD
horizon 717 hundred and eight course
sixteen thread CPU and that will make
light work of Joshua's videos the Rison
processor will be installed on the
impressive-looking a seuss ROG Strix B
350 - F gaming motherboard with 8
gigabytes of ddr4 memory
now way back over to the US for a little
veggie my hmm was unexpected didn't
expect to see Vegemite next to a
computer in one of these but anyway
Australian spreads aside we have a
rather smart looking PC built by JC here
and it was built back in 2014 for less
than $500 u.s. which happens to be our
budget today
JC admits though that his priorities
were a little off on this one as he
spent most of the money on the case but
after seeing the end case in one version
Foy just had to have it so it's fair to
say any upgrade plans that we make now
will be based around this case although
the system is pretty basic with an AMD
a10 7850 ka pu and the Radeon HD 6870
graphics card JC's not really asking
that much of it at the moment is he
really only plays a super smash brothers
melee on net play via the dolphin
emulator that said he is planning on
upgrading for next year to play monster
hunter world which will no doubt be a
bit too much for the APU and 6000 series
GPU so for this upgrade I'm again going
to go with the rising 5 1400 because we
also need to replace the graphics card
and that will only fit in our budget the
real tough choice here though for me was
what motherboard we go with because we
are limited to an AM 4 Mini ITX
motherboard and there really aren't that
many of those around and pretty much all
of them are priced over $100 us which
kind of blows out our budget a bit so
yeah there is a biostar board for $85 us
which looks to be an exceptionally good
value buy but I've never really
recommended a biostar product before and
I was a bit hesitant to touch this one
after a bit of research it seems to have
received pretty solid reviews from
professional reviewers and the user
feedbacks also been very positive since
it will work within our budget
and my hands are pretty much tied anyway
because we can't afford anything else
I'm gonna bite the bullet I recommend at
the Biostar X 370gt n it's pretty much
our only choice so let's go with it
and yeah I've got no reason to doubt it
at this point the only problem with a
Mini ITX board and we'll face this
problem with any Mini ITX borders there
if JC wants to expand the memory down or
in the future he will have to dump the 8
gigabyte chip that we've purchased with
this upgrade package and then buy a pair
of 8 gigabyte sticks for a 16 gigabyte
capacity but that is the limitation of
the Mini ITX form factor as I said
there's no getting around that
then handling the 3d rendering work
which I suppose the gaming will be the
chiefest GT x 1050 Ti which should be a
nice upgrade from the old Radeon HD 6850
should JC win he'll be receiving a huge
upgrade from what he currently has and
should be well primed to take on Monster
Hunter World next year
