sponsoring our trip to Computex 2019
please check out their range of Intel
based motherboards via the link in the
video description also thank you to
Corsair for their support please check
all their exciting products out via the
link in the video description welcome
back to harbor unboxed we are at the
gigabyte horas booth today and we're
mostly interested in their X 570 range
of motherboards because they look
absolutely incredible probably the
best-looking X 570 boards we've come
across yet the VRMs on these boards are
just phenomenal we'll dive into those in
a minute and give you all the details
they've also got proper cooling on them
which is great to see and yeah we're
just really keen to check these boards
out so we'll go do that now but before
we get into gigabytes impressive-looking
range of X 570 motherboards I just
wanted to quickly address this X 499
leak it was reported that gigabyte
accidentally leaked Intel's upcoming X
499 chipset with their extreme water
forced motherboard which is clearly
labeled as an X 499 board
it sounds like Intel was looking to
refresh their LGA 2066 platform by
renaming the X 299 chipset to X 499 and
this would make way for their upcoming
third gen core X h EDT lineup but it
seems like Intel might have thought
better of that now and they're just
sticking with X 299 at least for now
gigabyte said the X 499 naming was a
placeholder since Intel only updated
board partners very recently gigabyte
has now gone with X 299 G the G at the
end indicates that these are new boards
for 2019 that makes them a little easier
to differentiate from existing X 299
parts it's still the same old X true 99
chipset though so no changes there
anyway the X 299 G or s extreme water
force is a super impressive looking
motherboard sadly though I doubt Intel's
14 nanometer plus plus cascade Lake X
processors will be as exciting moving on
a few months ago Infineon announced the
first true 1000 volt ejaculator
also the industry's first 16 phase
digital PWM multi-phase controller
codenamed XDP e1 3 to g5 see this 16
phase controller is designed to be
paired with the TDA 2147 578 power state
and I believe this is exactly what
gigabyte has done giving their flagship
board the x5 70 or s extreme a current
capacity of 1000 120 amps under optimal
conditions
this means gigabyte is able to offer a
16 phase motherboard without having to
use doublers and amusingly their spec
sheet says and definitely not parallel
clearly that's a shot at a soos and
their doubled-up design that features 16
power stages teamed up in pairs to make
an eight phase-- vrm a soos claims this
improves transient response time as they
don't use doubles but that argument kind
of goes right at the window when you
competitor offers a 14 plus two-phase
vrm without the need for doublers
gigabyte also claims that the Auris
extreme is the most efficient x 570
board on the market and with their real
friend heat sinks they say it'll run
nice and cool and honestly we don't had
any of that but of course I also can't
wait to test a huge range of X 570
motherboards before moving on I should
just quickly note that the Auris extreme
comes with a nano carbon baseplate three
PCIe 4.0 m2 slots with thermal guards
Wi-Fi 6 10 Gigabit Ethernet and this is
a passively cooled board so it's the
only x5 70 board that we know of that
doesn't require a fan to cool the
chipset that's quite impressive though
not entirely surprising though given the
amount of aluminium on this thing it's
heavier than a cinder block then
second-in-command gigabyte has the x5 70
Oris master and this model features a 14
phase verum using the same Infineon pwm
it's a 12 + 2 configuration using 50 amp
power stages this model also features
proper finned heat sinks over the vm
components and there's also a huge array
of features such as 3m 2 slots Wi-Fi 6
Bluetooth 5 and two-and-a-half gigabit
ethernet it's another great looking
board will have no issue overclocking
something like the rise in nine
processes to the max gigabyte also used
a 12 + 2 phase vm configuration for the
Auris ultra and pro versions then
there's the elite which also features a
12 + 2 verum though I believe there is a
component change here as it is the most
affordable or SX 570 motherboard then
lastly we checked out the x5 70 I or s
pro Wi-Fi and this cute little guy is a
mini ITX motherboard with a V
that puts most high index 470
motherboards to shame I'm not even
joking about that it packs a six plus
two phase IR vrm with a nice big heat
sink though this time we don't get real
Finn's still you'll have no issues with
a 105 what part in this board and I
imagine you'll even be able to overclock
at the snot out of it the board also
packs a pair of M two slots Wi-Fi six
and active cooling on the chipset
heatsink overall it looks to be a great
little board and I reckon there's a good
chance to mer myself may upgrade our
Computex editing rigs next year with a
pair of these and of course some rice
and nine processes moving on gigabyte
also had some nice-looking storage
devices on show the Auris m2 nvme PCIe
4.0 SSD is a slick looking drive and it
features a full-body copper heat
spreader for enhanced cooling naturally
it utilizes the fires and PS 5016 a 16
controller and this enables PCI 4.0
support but it also uses two Sheba's 3d
TLC NAND flash and it's available in 500
gigabyte one terabyte and two terabyte
capacities gigabytes claiming read
speeds of 5 gigabytes per second and
write speeds of 4.4 gigabytes per second
however the storage device that really
caught our attention was the Auris
Master m2 G 4 this is a PCIe 4.0 x 4
expansion card that supports 4 m2 SSDs
for a sequential read and write speeds
of around 15 gigabytes per second when
configured in raid 0 there so stays a
cooled via double-sided thermal pads
that are attached to direct touch heat
pipes along with an active fan it will
drool-worthy product that would be a
dream for content creation or basically
any workload that can take advantage of
insanely fast storage needless to say
it's at the top of my shopping list or
my wish list and I hope I get the
opportunity to test it out with some
Rison 3000 series processors ok so that
concludes our tour of the gigabyte Oris
booth
hope you guys enjoyed those motherboards
and I'm keen to see what you guys think
or keen to hear what you guys think
about those massive VR
on all those X 570 motherboards anyway
thanks for watching remember to
subscribe like and I'll see you again
