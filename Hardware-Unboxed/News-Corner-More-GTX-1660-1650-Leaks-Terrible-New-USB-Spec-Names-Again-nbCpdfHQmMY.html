core it's been a relatively slow news
week this week a lot of that is down to
Mobile World Congress which kicked off
earlier this week in Barcelona if you're
interested in mobile tech and phone so
I'm sure there's been a lot of
interesting stuff hubris far as PC
hardware is concerned most interesting
developments are a bit on pause until
MWC is over first topic I want to cover
is just a brief note on ambe's rise in
mobile driver release this is something
AMD we promised would happen at CES and
they've just managed to slip it in at
the end of February through the release
of Radeon Software 19 2.3 aside from a
set of improvements for owners of
desktop cards and other discreet GPUs
these are the first generic drivers to
support rise in mobile ap use which is a
major milestone for the platform the
lack of drivers prior to now something a
lot of users have complained about
continually since the launch which was
more than a year ago now anyway a number
of you guys have asked us to cover this
I've been testing the drivers myself on
an original rise in mobile laptop and
I'll have more to share on that tomorrow
but if you do own a rise in mobile
laptop please go and download these
generic drivers and try them out for
yourselves this should work on any rise
in mobile laptop which is great to see
the USB implementers forum will make us
be naming even more confusing and
ridiculous later this year with the
introduction of USB 3.2 apparently the
whole USB 3.0 USB 3.1 gen2 on gen 2
thing wasn't already terrible enough
because we're said to get a higher tier
providing faster speeds called USB 3.2
Gen 2 by 2
yep that's the actual name they chose
the big update here is a jump in total
bandwidth to 20 gigabits per second up
from 10 gigabits per second with USB 3.1
gen2 you'll need a USB type-c cable for
these speeds but it sounds as though
there would be any change to connectors
or cables to support this new mode and
the reason it's called USB 3.2 gen 2 by
2 is it uses two USB C channels so to 10
gigabits per second channels for a total
of 20 gigabits per second USB 3.2 will
also absorb the older branding
of USB 3.1 CSP 3.1 Gen 1 becomes USB 3.2
gen one supporting five gigabits per
second of bandwidth USB 3.1 gen2 becomes
USB 3.2 gen 2 and supporting 10 gigabits
per second of bandwidth but because some
older products will still be branded as
USB 3.1 or even USB 3.0 all sorts of
confusion comes into play is USB 3.2 gen
1 faster than USB 3.0 well technically
no they are the same but it sounds like
it based on the name surely the best
option would have been calling the five
gigabit per second spec USB 3.0 the
tengu bit per second spec USB 3.1 and
then the new 20 gigabit per second spec
USB 3.2 that would have been nice and
simple easy to understand but instead
the USB implementers forum wanted to
absorb the old brands into a new spec
and that's what's going to create a
pretty huge mess in the market we should
start to see the first USB 3.2 devices
this year presumably supporting Gen 2 by
2 although there's no word on exactly
where they will crop up considering the
first devices will require a discrete
USB 3.2 controller but probably looking
at enthused is great motherboards first
followed by peripherals down the line
probably in 2020 one of the cool
non-phone things announced at MWC were
the first 1 terabyte micro SD cards for
both SanDisk ok Western Digital and
micron it's pretty remarkable that we
now have a full 1 terabyte of storage
available in a chip that's as small as a
micro SD card I know these sorts of
things do keep increasing in capacity it
wasn't too long ago that we got the
first 512 geek mark o/s days but
compared to traditional necessities
there's something special about the tiny
nasaw I co SD both cards using 96 layer
3d NAND flash from their respective
companies micron confirms their card is
using ql scene and while Western Digital
doesn't specify these are micro SDXC
cards so they are compatible with all
micro SDXC card readers and both come
certified with a lot of SD relevant
badges such as v 30 video class speeds
meaning right speeds are at least 30
megabytes per second along with a 2 app
performance class beats indicating at
least 4k and 2k
random read and write ions respectively
microns card is ready for a hundred
megabytes of sequential reads per second
and 95 megabytes per second of
sequential writes while Western Digital
scarred is good for 160 to 170 megabytes
per second reads and writes which
exceeds what the uhs-1 bus can achieve
although other interfaces can harness
that performance obviously these cards
aren't as fast as an SSD you might put
in your PC that's really not the point
of a microSD card as we're pricing yeah
they're not going to come cheap $450 for
the SanDisk option when it goes on sale
in April
compared to $200 for the 512 gig card
micron hasn't specified a price though
they say their card will be available in
q2 yet another intel f-series process
has been spotted in a product listing
this time the Pentium Gold G 5600 F like
other F morals this appears to just be
AG 5600 without a functional ID GPU so
we're still looking at two cores and
four threads clocked up to 3.9 gigahertz
in a 54 watt package this is a pretty
interesting product for Intel to release
the G 56 hundreds main target market is
entry-level systems which don't always
come with a discrete GPU so the
integrated GPU tends to be a lot more
useful than in a high-end ship like the
9900 K that people typically pair with
the graphics card but with the G 5600 F
Intel is targeting super low-end gaming
roots that also included a screen ship
hue which is a little strange given the
G 5600 isn't particularly great for all
but the lowest end gaming to make
matters more unusual it's expected this
trip will cost just as much as the
regulatory 5600 that comes with an eye
GPU we don't have an official
confirmation on the price but so far all
of Intel's F model CPUs have been priced
in line with the non F models so you'd
have to wonder why you'd buy one without
9 GPU if you could have one with an IDE
GPU especially for a budget part
certainly will be interesting to see how
that one plays out
digi times have posted what they believe
are the release dates for the upcoming
NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 and GTX 1650
considering the source here is digi
times I reckon we probably need to take
this one with a massive grain of salt
but this news has been doing the round
so it may as well cover it here anyway
their information says the GTX 1660 will
be released on March 15th followed by
the GTX 1650 on April 30th count rumours
also suggest
1660 uses a tu1 1/6 GPU with 1280 CUDA
cores and six gigabytes of memory while
the GTX 1650 instead opts for a two one
one seven GPU we really don't have any
information to share on this one but I
think it's safe to assume Nvidia does
have a few more cheering GPUs in the
works and those I expect will be
released pretty soon it's pretty hot
here right now in other news corner in
38 degrees Celsius heat so I'm just
gonna rapid fire the rest of these
topics and get out of here really there
hasn't been many other topics to cover
so one interesting tidbit is named bees
new free sync a waiter's demo aim buddy
did send this out to us but I really
haven't had any time to check it out
it's mostly designed for PC stores
anywhere rather than for users to play
with although I did suggest Amy's that
they might like to make it available to
the public in any case what we've seen
with free sync and free sync to HDR can
do you know already seen that in the
past so not that exciting for us to be
honest in more storage news micron has
released new 1300 SSD but interval REM
systems using new 96 layer 3 dean and
however it's using TLC rather than qlc
so performance should be a little better
although it's capped by its silo space
anyway the drives will be available in
up to 1 terabytes and an MDOT true form
factor and 2 terabytes in a 2.5 inch
drive although no pricing list given
Nvidia has also partnered with OBS to
optimize the popular streaming and
encoding up for their GPUs specifically
their nuturing cards the idea is to
improve image quality and lessen the
framerate impact compared to in videos
older NV ink implementation in the app
I'm hoping to check this one out at some
point but the backlog is quite massive
right now
and that's it for this week's news
corner definitely a shorter than usual
episode hopefully there are more
interesting topics to talk about next
week once MWC is over I wasn't going to
go uncover the new phones the folding
FERS all that sort of thing there's
plenty sources that you can check out
all the information about that stuff in

inbox every week consider supporting us
on patreon to get access to exclusive
discs or community and I'll catch you in
the next one
