Pentium G 4400 and AMD athlon x4 860 K
there never to determine which budget
CPU games should purchase both cost well
under $100 and G 4400 which is my
preferred choice for gamers which is to
skylight cores and a whopping 3 megabyte
l3 cache which is especially whopping
when compared to the 860 K is complete
lack of an l2 cache at all the G 4400
isn't a bad budget processor but what if
I told you for about the same money you
could be rocking an octa-core processor
based on a fairly modern CPU
architecture with a truly massive 20
megabyte l3 cache huh what if I told you
that well it's true and there aren't
really any strings attached
the processor in question is the xeon e5
2617 a server grade processor that just
four years ago was retailing for 1550 us
today can be had for just 5 percent of
the original retail price now picks mine
up on eBay for just 75 us which works
out to only be 125 Australian including
shipping from the state's don't cheap
right for that money you get an 8 core
16 thread 32 nanometer Sandy Bridge EP
processor clocked at 2.6 gigahertz so
the 3.3 gigahertz maximum turbo
frequency as this is a xeon processor it
can also support ECC memory along with
standard ddr3 memory clocked up to 1600
megahertz running in quad-channel compte
if you own the other piece of the
equation is an intel x79 motherboard
which can be also purchased online for a
fair price expect to pay just under 200
US or a little less than 300 Australian
in comparison the core i7 4960 expose
just 6 cores that they are clocked
higher than 3.6 gigahertz the 4096 DX
also is a smaller 15 megabyte 3 cache
though it can support slightly faster
ddr3 1866 memory what's most important
to note here is that the 49 60 X began
selling in late 2013 for
one thousand dollars and today you can
still expect to pay that same ridiculous
figure for one those wanting an intel 8
core processor in their desktop system
limited to the core i7 59 60 X while
it's a very impressive CPU it comes to
the tune of 1050 US dollars or a wallet
melting 1600 Australian spec wise the
core i7 59 60 X and xeon e5 20 60 70 and
actually quite a similar on paper with
the only significant difference being
the change in cpu architecture from
Sandy Bridge to has well I'm not
suggesting the e5 2670 will be faster or
even as fast as the 59 60 X but don't
expect it to be much slower either given
the extreme price difference that's
really something obviously an 8 core
processor was going to crush the Pentium
G 4400 what about the much more
expensive Core i5 6600 K and i7 6700 K
processors let's go to the benchmark lab
and find out the memory bandwidth
performance of the e5 2670 is greater
than that of the core i7 6700k and Core
i5 6600 k processors and 39 gigabytes
per second the l1 cache performance
however is quite a bit slower as the
xeon processors based on two generation
old architecture now the three DPM
benchmark runs through six algorithms
for a specified number of particles and
steps and calculates the speed of each
algorithm then sums them all for a final
score for single threaded tasks the e5
2670 is going to lag behind higher clock
processes such as the 6600 K and 6700 K
though it's still faster than the FX 283
70 the multi-threaded performance on the
other hand is very impressive
placing the e5 2670 smack bang in the
middle of the 59 60 X + 67 okay the
synthetic Cinebench r15 is a popular
benchmark for measuring raw CPU
performance with single and multi
threaded this time we see the e5 2670 is
closer to the 6700 K than the 59 60s in
performance but it crushed the FX 83 17
and Core i5 6600 k if compression is you
game then take known as the a5 2670
isn't a great deal slower than the 59
60s
it is however world's faster than the
6700 K providing 60% more performance
the multi-threaded test
those of you into complex spreadsheets
will love with the a5 2670 has drop-off
and completed the famous Monte Carlo
workload in just 2.9 seconds which again
placed it between the 59 60 X 60 700 K
both of which are obviously very fast
desktop processors not into Excel maybe
Photoshop CC is more your jam
if so the e 526 70 will also impress
here as it completed the workload in
just 13 point 4 seconds once again
placing it between the 6700 K and the 59
HDX the x264 HD benchmark measures
encoding performance here we see that
although the e5 2670 is quite a bit
slower than the 59 60 X it does manage
to out-compete the 6700 K while it wipes
the floor with the core i5 6600 K + FX
83 70 it wouldn't be right if I didn't
include some gaming benchmarks so here
they are and first up we have the
Witcher 3 Wild Hunt in the CPU intensive
town of novigrad we see the a5 2670
hangs in there with the 59 60 X making
it slightly faster than FX 83 17 the
lower clock speed of the e5 2670 does
hurt it a little bit in Just Cause 3
there considering we are testing with
the geforce gtx 980ti the performs are
still very good certainly much better
than the FX 83-73 526 17 you can again
be found lagging behind the desktop
processors this time in grand theft auto
5 still for such an affordable processor
a minimum of 80 FPS is nothing to sneeze
at the Boston section of fallout 4 seems
to suffer from a coding bottleneck if
that is the thing in our tests using the
latest version of the game just 30% of
the e5 2670 was being utilized and while
all threads are being actively used none
were being maxed out these results were
included because the game is hugely
popular but they should probably be
taken with a grain of salt finally we
have call of duty black ops 3 and here
the a5 2067 you performed very well
getting the most out of the geforce gtx
980ti graphics card with an average of
123 FPS the a5 2670 was faster than the
core i5 6600 k and much faster than the
FX 83-70 this video came about after
watching a tech gaming weekly live
stream where brian from tech yesterday
talked about the insane bargain that is
the xeon e5 26:17
comes to secondhand deals brian is the
man so I jumped on ebay and quickly
pulled the trigger after landing the
processor for 125 Australian I've since
grabbed a second before even last 110
dollars
I plan to eventually throw them together
on a dual socket server board for some
SMP 16 core action honestly if I was
looking at building a new computer today
I'd be very tempted by a secondhand xeon
e5 2670 and in the company x79
motherboard the combo can be had around
$250 from reputable sellers on ebay with
that you just need to add some ddr3
memory in your away just make sure you
don't buy an engineering sample and
don't be confused by the xeon e5 2670 v2
which is a 10 core version that costs
around six times more in comparison the
FX 83-70 system that we tested will cost
you around the same figure if you opt
for a low-end AMD 970 motherboard the
difference being you get considerably
more performance out of the second-hand
Xeon setup including 75 percent more
performance in applications such as
Photoshop CC 100 percent more in WinRAR
gamers also stand to benefit from the
xeon e5 2617 as it crushed the FX 83-70
and all tests realistically it wasn't a
great deal slower than the core i5 6600
k the cpu that'll set you back $250 loan
applications and games that take
advantage of all eight cores will see
the e5 2670 lan pretty much right
between the core i7 6 to 700 K and 5960
x which were a $75 processor is
obviously a serious deal the only other
drawback to the e 5 2016 7 year other
than is limited and locked clock speed
is the x79 chipset
the x79 was barely an upgrade from the
x58 chipset that came three years before
it essentially you got two extra USB
ports two additional PCIe x 1 lanes and
a pair of SATA 6 gigabits per second
port upgrades still the x79 speed you
said might not impress but it does
include all the essentials and more
modern hardware such as m2 nvme SSDs can
be added using a PCI Express adapter
card the answer of x79 extreme 6 that I
bought for testing work very well I'm
still playing around the overclocking as
limit
that may be so far with 107 megahertz
base clock I've only been able to
extract around 10% more performance so
nothing to write home about
it's also worth mentioning that the xeon
e5 2670 is a 115 watt processor that
seemed to generate a similar amount of
head as a 140 watt 59 60 X so decent
cooler is in order so what are you
waiting for go get yourself a 16
threaded Xeon for the price of a modern
budget processor do it now</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
