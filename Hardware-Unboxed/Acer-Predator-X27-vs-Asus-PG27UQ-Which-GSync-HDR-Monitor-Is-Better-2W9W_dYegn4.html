couple of weeks ago you might have
spotted my review of the Asuza rog swift
PG 27 uq the first monitor on the market
to sport a 4k resolution up to 144 hertz
with full display HDR 1000 certification
and of course chasing HDR it's a very
impressive monitor certainly one of if
not the best you can get though I didn't
exactly give it a full recommendation
due to its $2,000 price tag and a few
early adopter issues well
the PG 27 uq isn't the only such monitor
on the market a suit has some
competition in the form of the Acer
predator X 27 which I'm looking at today
both the PG tweet 7uq and X 27 used the
same a Optronics panel so they're both
equipped with the same specifications
but that doesn't mean they perform the
same as I'll discuss a bit later in fact
I guess the whole point is video is to
determine whether the a suit or ASA
model is the better by considering both
command the same price tag in terms of
design it's an easy winter I see here
the predator X 27 is simply a far more
attractive and well-built product
compared to the PG 27 UQ certainly more
fitting of its monstrous price tag the
front of the display itself isn't all
that different to the Zeus model with
the similar bezel sides and similar
simple design but it's the stand with
the X 27 starts to differentiate itself
with a much more elegant and less
overtly gamer design up until the pillow
The Stand uses a unique and entirely
metal construction per fitting of a
premium display with that ridiculous
light projection features or colored
highlights the chunky pillar on the rear
which provides height and swivel adjust
along with the usual tilt support does
ruin the elegant sign a little bit
however you can't see it from the front
which is good news the rest of the rear
looks reasonable though it does fall a
bit into the gamer category however it's
not nearly as bad as the suitors
ridiculous tech pattern on the PG 27 UQ
so in comparison the X 27 is basically
the most beautiful monitor ever created
the X 27 does use plastic everywhere but
the legs featuring two different
finishes on the rear and it does still
feel a little trip the monitor is also a
bit of a chunky beast though I
spec that's mostly due to the FAL D
backlight there are also two RGB LED
strips integrated into the design one in
the v-shaped event towards the top and
the other along the bottom edge
certainly a cleaner way to integrate RGB
than simply chucking it into a massive
logo on the rear though personally I'd
still disable it all the inputs you're
getting no different to other g-sync
monitors a single DisplayPort and single
HDMI port plus an audio jack and USB 3.0
hub with a couple of handy quick access
ports on the left side the OSD is
controlled through a directional toggle
which is great to see and navigating
aces feature back menus easy and fast
most of the things you find here relate
to color and backlight controls but
there is still favorites like you know
you cheap crosshairs dark blue stop
shion's but there is no ultra low motion
blur the other thing you'll be
interested in I'm sure is the active
cooling fan I criticize the asou speed 7
you for having an audible cooling fan
for the chasing HDR module and I'm sorry
to say the Acer predator X 27 also
requires a fan to cool the internals
however AC uses a noticeably different
controller for its fan which allows it
to vary the fan speed these suits
version of this monitor runs the fan at
the same speed all the time while the
Acer model ramps up the fans slowly from
idle which is a more pleasant and gentle
way to introduce the noise the monitor
creates the X 27 also appears quieter in
its SDR mode while running HDR content
fires up the fan to around the same
level of noise as the PG 27 UQ
that said the fan is still audible
during SDR operation which can be a bit
annoying depending on the ambient noise
in your room ideally this sort of
monitor wouldn't require a fan and if it
did the fan will be larger slower in the
asylum Plaza mentioning the PG 27 new Q
review this is one of those issues that
comes about with early adopter products
moving into performance and we'll start
with HDR features because it's the key
feature of the predator X 27 nothing
here is really all that different to the
PG 27 UQ so if you're interested in a
more detailed sort of thoughts on how
this monitor fares in terms of HD I'd
suggest going back and watching the XJR
section of that review but I will
summarize I guess the key points here
the predator X 27 ticks basically every
box in my ex gr monitor checklist
including great brightness support of
600 nits sustained and over a sour
it's peak brightness accuracy is decent
so when content requests say 700 nits be
displayed the x27 gets pretty close to
that mark with its default settings I
also retrieved around 1100 nits maximum
from a 10% window or smaller which is
certainly very good contrast is
excellent thanks to a full array local
dimming backlight with 384 zones it's
very fast and produces no visible
afterglow even after bright objects
disappear from view each zone is small
enough that you won't notice glow around
the edges of bright objects in typical
movies or games it's only in desktop
usage that you might run into those
artifacts with local dimming enabled the
contrast ratio is as high as 50 mm to
one though that various depending on the
brightness of the content of course
maximum sustained contrast ratio is
around thirty thousand six hundred to
one in the HDR mode with black levels
significantly lower than any other LCD
monitor without local dimming ISO
provides several backlight speeds but
for most users I'd recommend leaving it
on the default gaming mode which is the
fastest as for wide gamut support again
the X between seven ticks all the right
boxes here provides 93% DCI p3 coverage
99% Adobe RGB coverage and 150 % srgb
coverage the panel is 8 bit plus frc not
to be able to notice the difference
compared to a true 10 bit panel in
almost every situation but of course it
supports 10-bit color processing all of
this means you're getting a much wider
array of colors in the HDR mode again as
far as monitors go the x27 provides the
best HDR experience you can get right
now and gains the support HDR well
really do look significantly better in
the HDR mode on this monitor with
brighter highlights a wider range of
colors and spectacular contrast in fact
this snippet from my PG 27 UQ review
sums it up pretty well in games like Far
Cry 5 that support actually are really
well you're not only getting a more
vibrant image as the panel can actually
display more colors but there's so much
more detail visible particularly in high
contrast scenes taken an outdoor sunny
scene with heavy shadowing this monitor
has the ability to dazzle you with the
Sun burning in a thousand nits while
simultaneously providing plenty of
visible detail in a dark shadowy area
neither of these elements are blown out
because the monitors dynamic range far
exceeds a regular SDR display and it
more closely
simulates how the scene would look in
real life so yeah hg on the ASA Predator
X 27 is a lot better than any boring old
regular SDR display whether that's worth
two thousand dollars is another question
which I'll touch on at the end of course
like with the PG 27 uq there is the
issue of refresh rate and chroma
subsampling again I go to a lot more
detail in my page a 27-year Q video but
the basic issue boils down to
DisplayPort bandwidth there's simply not
enough for HDR SDR content at 4k 144
hurts instead
full 444 RGB is only possible at 4k 120
Hertz in the SDR mode and for k98 Hertz
in the HDR mode if you want to run at
higher than those refresh rates such as
the monitors maximum 144 Hertz refresh
rate you'll have to put up with 4 to 2
chroma subsampling which reduces the
Chrome resolution and can introduce
artifacts in some situations chroma
subsampling in my opinion it's extremely
hard to spot in video content and in
games but it is noticeable in desktop
apps with artifacts around solid edges
and text and still class the issue is
minor but it's disappointing DisplayPort
is limiting me as displays from reaching
their full potential hopefully that's
resolved with future tech and advise
people using the display in a desktop
SDR mode to cap the monitor to 120 or
even 98 Hertz and for HDR gaming run at
98 Hertz unless you have powerful enough
hardware to exceed 100 FPS at 4k let's
move into looking at SDR performance
because here there are a few differences
between a sauna suits models in terms of
brightness and contrast ratio everything
is still quite similar though the x27
goes up to a maximum of 317 nits in the
SDR mode with a native contrast ratio
around 1100 to 1 that said I'd still
recommend leaving the dynamic backlight
enabled for most SDR content in which
case we'll achieve a contrast ratio
around 10,000 to 1 at 200 nits though of
course that varies with the brightness
level you set the monitor to black
levels are outstanding for LCD with the
dynamic backlight enabled as well
response times one area where the x27
differs compared to the PG 27 you cube
each company has the ability to tweak
their overdrive controls despite using
the same panel and in the case of the a
sauna suits models aces overdrive
controls I guess a
lacking our standard test procedure
involves finding the best overdrive
setting that delivers less than a five
percent overshoot and then using that
setting for response time testing in the
case of the a sous monitor that was the
normal mode which produced an average
greater gray response time of four point
one eight milliseconds with no overshoot
whatsoever however with the SX 27 their
normal overdrive mode one of two modes
the other being extreme is a bit more
aggressive it produces a quicker
response time but some transitions had
upwards of 10% overshoot which is beyond
our tolerances so for the x27 the best
thing to use is actually overdrive
disables a disappointing results as it's
the only mode where overshoot is not
present in this mode average grader
great response times are six point six
two milliseconds a few milliseconds
slower than the asou smaadahl and that's
with the dynamic backlight enabled which
was also the setting used for testing
the PG 27 UQ four point two to six point
six milliseconds isn't noticeable jump
in response time which leaves the x27
with more ghosting and smearing compared
to the PG 27 UQ I reckon ASA could have
tweaked their overdrive algorithm to
deliver performance much closer to the
page a 27 UQ but they didn't that said
this result is still a lot better than
popular VA panels and the average
transition time is still lower than the
refresh window of six point nine four
milliseconds in better news the ASA
Predator X 27 exhibits superior input
latency falling from fifteen point six
milliseconds to eleven point four
milliseconds this means that overall
when you factor in the input lag and
pixel response time the X 27 is actually
slightly faster than the PG 27 UQ I was
expecting to see the same input latency
for both monitors so it's a nice
surprise that the X 27 is faster looking
at color performance ASA factory
calibrates all predator X 27 units to a
delta 8 accuracy less than 1.0 for SDR
content which is an extremely tight
professional grade certification
bizarrely though they don't advertise
this on their website anywhere or on
their Amazon product page despite
including a color accuracy stick on the
monitor itself along with a calibration
report in the box
considering ASA calibrates the X 27 to a
greater level of accuracy than the PG 27
UQ a Seuss only promises a delta e below
3.0
you'd think ASA would like to advertise
this fact and default color performance
is certainly very impressive the CCT
curve isn't quite as tight as you get
from full calibration but a delta
average of 0.76 is excellent as is the
near-perfect gamma curve this
performance continues in the saturation
and color checker tests both of which
exhibit Delta a averages near 0.5 which
is absolutely elite for a gaming monitor
you'd be very happy with this level of
factory performance from a professional
monitor although my guess for $2000 you
really should be getting full
calibration like this and the important
thing to note is the X 27 is more
accurate out of the box in the PG 27 UQ
the asustor model is still quite good
with those to eat averages around 1.3 to
1.5 but the X 27 takes things one step
further and with a few very minor tweaks
to colors in the on-screen display the X
27 produces the best color results I've
seen yet with an average Delta a of just
0.36 in greyscale a perfect CCT curve
and a perfect saturation Delta eight of
just 0.2 9 this increases the gap
between the a sauna suits models is the
Isuzu model doesn't change significantly
with OSD tweaks this level of
performance from a few OSD tweaks is
better than I could achieve with the
full calibration pass in Kalman 5 in a
software profile so there isn't any
reason to run a full calibration there's
really no way to describe this level of
color performance other than to say it's
perfect to make matters even better the
president x 27 exhibits fantastic
uniformity at a maximum Delta II of 2.5
in the upper right corner and Delta s at
or below 2.0 for the rest of the monitor
the X 27 delivers professional-grade
uniformity it will be very difficult for
any typical user to spot unevenness in
this panel I'm not sure whether its
natural variants in panels whether SRS
specifically requesting the more uniform
panels that come out of the factory but
the X 27 is noticeably more uniform than
the PG 27 UQ which was a bit uneven
along the top and bottom edges I could
only go in one our tests and in this
case the X 27 is the better option so
when it comes to the conclusion of this
review I wanted to answer one question
first is the Acer predator X 27 or the
Zeus rog swift PG 27 UQ
the better of the two g-sync HDR
monitors well in my testing it's pretty
much a slam-dunk victory to the iCIMOD
both panels have equivalent HDR
performance but it's the ASA model that
comes with better factory calibration
and a more uniform panel delivering a
professional-grade experience that the
asustor area doesn't quite reach when
you spending $2,000 you really should be
getting professional level accuracy and
of the two variants only the ASA model
is truly providing that out of the box
the ASA model is slightly slow in terms
of response times but it's fast in terms
of input layer creating a fairly even
battle there overall and I also think
the x27 has a much nicer design even if
it still requires an active cooling fan
then the question becomes should you
spend $2,000 on the Acer predator X 27
at all and that's the trickier one to
answer but I think what I said in my
review of the PG 27 UQ also applies here
the X 27 is no doubt a very impressive
piece of hardware with excellent
performance and great HDR support but
the $2,000 price is still ludicrous when
you can get a great 1440p 144 Hertz
g-sync monitor for about 500 bucks it
won't be as high-resolution and won't
provide HDR but I don't think the bump
to 4k HDR is worth $1500 I also think
there are a few too many early adopter
issues like the active cooling fan the
expensive g-sync HDR module and chroma
subsampling the panel does work well but
I think a lot of these issues will be
ironed out in a potentially more
affordable next gen product and let's be
honest
these shoes are compounded by a lack of
decent HDR games you're not only
spending a lot of money to get hgr today
but you're also limited to a small
handful of tiles that make the most of
this monitors top-end features with any
sort of technology you can always fall
into the trap of saying to wait for the
next greatest thing but in the case of
this HDR monitor by the time there is a
large range of decent HDR games to play
is likely this panel will be replaced by
a cheaper better version and it's at
that point I'd recommend jumping into
the world of high-end HDR gaming whereas
today I think it's still a bit too early
to be investing two thousand dollars
like with the PG 27 UQ I don't think x27
buyers will all be disappointed as it's
a great flagship display with excellent
ecology inside but personally I'd be
waiting until the ecosystem is a bit
more mature and there are a few more HDR
monitors on the market to choose from
that's it for this review of the ASA
Predator X 27 links to check its current
price are in the description hopefully
in a few months if you're watching it a
few months after this video went live
it'll have dropped in price a bit
