do it first though how'd I let you guys
down gently hmm okay well first here's
some quick background information about
the a12 900 and this new series of paper
used from AMD for those of you who
aren't yet up to speed
AMD released Rison earlier this year
which I'm sure you are aware of and it's
been happy times for enthusiasts ever
since budget shoppers recently received
the quad-core Eisen 3 models but those
who are in a truly tight budget they're
still hanging out for those ap use which
integrate both the CPU and GPU under the
one roof this first wave of AMD APU is
on the am 4 platform have been given the
codename Bristol Ridge but they aren't
what many believe them to be or at least
hope they'll be in short these arts and
based ap use and those probably won't
arrive till sometime next year what we
have here our excavator base CPU cores
in other words I refined bulldozer
architecture and I am using the word
refined quite loosely here the a 12-9
100 for example sports for excavator
cause along with a generically named 512
stream processor enabled radeon r7 GPU
the bristol ridge series was released as
om products late last year but have
recently become available on the retail
market and this has caused a good many
of you to get very excited the a12 9800
now costs 110 dollars u.s. and promises
pretty decent integrated graphics
performance and the best part being that
you can take advantage of it on the new
am 4 motherboards such as those sporting
a be 350 chipset there's also a much
cheaper an equally popular version
without the integrated GPU called the
athlon x4 950 and at $60 u.s. people
have already started snapping them up
however the less impulsive buyers among
you have been desperately asking me to
check these in your am for parts out to
see if they're any good so let's do
exactly that right now ok so right off
the bat let's get this out of the way
for now the bristol ridge range only
supports up to ddr4 2400 memory and
right now there is simply no way to set
the memory
be any higher at least on the
motherboards I tried memory performance
was always a big issue for the bulldozer
architecture and after numerous
revisions it's still rather pathetic
compared to the Intel competition here
we see the G 4560 pushing more than
twice the bandwidth of the a12 9800 also
keep in mind this apu also has to feed
an integrated GPU with a measly
eleven point two gigabytes of balance
it's pretty tragic stuff next up we have
seen a bench r15 which is a good
synthetic benchmark for gauging how
powerful a cpu single and multi-threaded
performance really is as you can see the
dual core Pentium G 4560 has no trouble
hose in the a12 900 in both the single
and multi-threaded tests and it's
clocked quite a bit lower as well yep
this is all looking very familiar very
bulldozer ish so far to me PC mark 10
throws a number of common productivity
workloads at the system and here we can
see the individual scores for the of
writing and spreadsheets tests even
these basic tasks present a real
challenge for the quad-core apu don't
even bother with content creation here
the a12 1900 was outscored by the g 45
60 by a massive 64 percent margin dual
cores rule and old excavator corbeil
CPUs drool that's the saying isn't it
moving on we tried out the Monte Carlo
simulation workload and here the APU
keeps us waiting for almost 16 seconds
again 64 percent longer than the G 45 60
so you want to do some encoding on a
budget well then get the horizon 3 1200
because it was a hundred and fifty
percent faster for the same price you'll
need a cheap GPU with the Rison three
processor but that shouldn't be an issue
for more than twice the CPU firepower
the a12 900 also took 46 percent longer
than the G 45 60 in the corona benchmark
and 52 percent longer than the r3 1200
the blender results aren't actually that
bad here the a12 900 did beat out the G
45 60 though it has to be said the G 45
60 does put on a very poor showing in
this test the apu was still 46 percent
slower than the horizon 3 1200 now we
have the Premiere Pro CC results and if
you're buying the a 12 900 for a cheap
video editing rig well I hope you're
only making minute long skits because
our one minute and 36
video took roughly 13 minutes to render
now for some game test using an extreme
high and discrete graphics card before
we run a few integrated GPU tests now
before you lose your mind that we're
using a $110 CP with a $1,000 GPU just
take a breath and relax this just gives
us an idea of what the CPU side of
things can deliver when uncapped before
we get to the budget stuff so with the
brakes off the a12 900 was good for just
40 FPS in this real-time strategy title
and was 18% sold in the G 4560 in this
very CPU intensive game moreover it was
30% slower than the horizon 3 1200
things look much worse this time in
battlefield 1 and these are important
results to note even with the Pascal
based Titan GPU what this means is
regardless of the graphics card you use
it's not possible for the a12 900 to
average more than 50 fps and will often
dip into the low 40s you guys often ask
me how it's possible at consoles with
their mini jaguar cores are so much
slower than budget cpus like the pentium
g 45 60 well this is your answer finally
we have hitman and here's another tunnel
that shows us that no matter what kind
of GPU firepower you bring to the table
the a12 900 isn't going to a laugh
anywhere near 60 FPS on average now just
finally before we get to the integrated
GPU gaming stuff here we have the full
power consumption figures for the fully
configured systems that right there
shows us just how much of a truly
massive step forward
AMD may with the Zen architecture here
we see that the a12 900 it consumes
almost as much power as the 6 core 12
thread Rison 5 1600 in the excel test
and we're not even stressing the GPU
here the figures look much the same in
the Cinebench r15 multi-threaded
benchmark as well the total system
consumption was 121 percent higher than
that of the pentium g 45 60 and we often
saw quite a lot less performance alright
so here's a test the a12 900 can win
against the pentium g 4560 testing
integrated graphics Intel's integrated
HD graphics is still a complete joke for
the most part especially on their more
affordable CPUs
the G 45 60 is basically ok for Windows
applications but is just pretty much
next to useless for any kind of serious
three
rendering tasks here at average is just
14 fps and overwatch while the a12 900
managers are much more respectable 43
fps that said using the lowest possible
in-game quality settings at 1080p the
quad-core apu didn't exactly deliver a
smooth experience with regular dips
below 30 fps installing the $70 GeForce
GT 1030 improve Mahomet on both CPUs
dramatically though the g45 60 did
deliver a better overall experience and
it was noticeably smoother the a 12-9
hundreds integrated GPU does quite well
in rocket League and with the game using
very little CPU power the APU does do
quite well here the G 4560 using the
Intel HD graphics are still a pile of
snot though with the GeForce GT 1038
does do very well finally I decided to
check out csgo and here the G 4560
actually did manage to average 48 FPS
using the Intel HD graphics there
overall the experience was still pretty
horrible for novice players the 8-12 900
wasn't too bad though even with a
discrete GPU we still hit the same 45
FPS 1% low the G 45 60 proved to be a
beast with the GT 1030 installed and
never dip below a hundred FPS right so
at this point you can probably tell I'm
not at all impressed with the a12 900
and really I strongly recommend you
avoid purchasing any of the bristol
ridge cpus i thought long and hard about
this and i can't really think of one
valid situation where these cpus make an
ounce of sense now you wouldn't buy any
of these CPUs merely as a placeholder so
you can get a zen based apu or maybe a
rise on 3 cpu down the track that makes
about as much sense as buying a kb like
ex cpu as a tie over for one of the six
core 8 core or bigger sky like ex cpus
and then of course there is the athlon
x4 950 and that is very cheap at 60
dollars I'll admit but it really
delivers the exact same performance as
what we just saw out of this chip with a
discrete GPU the G 45 60 on the other
hand all that can be had for about $80
u.s. at the moment and it's really
world's better in every single way
compared to the Athlon chip
basically in order to use the athlon x4
950 or the a12 900 you need to buy a new
a m4 motherboard and we
that's a new ddr4 memory say you do go
with an ultra cheap a320 board for $50
eight gigabytes of ddr4 for $70 that
means the a 12900 upgrade package will
set you back two hundred and thirty
dollars meanwhile the same memory and
motherboard combo with a rise in three
twelve hundred CPU plus the GeForce GT
1030 will cost you $300
so that's only a 30% increase in price
for over twice the CPU power and twice
the GPU power meanwhile if you're
optically athlon x4 950 and the GT 1030
combo instead well that's even worse as
the rise in three 1200 with the same
discrete graphics card cost just 20%
more I haven't touched no overclocking
here and frankly I'm not even gonna
bother even if you could push the a 12
no I heard there's something insane like
say five point five gigahertz and it's
still pretty much just suck of course it
can't actually operate that frequency
when overclocked I have heard of people
getting it up to about 4.8 gigahertz and
at that frequency it still struggles to
keep pace with the G 45 60 while drawing
something like three times more power
faster memory would no doubt help
assuming the memory controller can
handle it but even with ddr4 4000 memory
for example isn't going to save the
bristol ridge cpus as we saw with the
same ddr4 2400 memory as the g 45 60 we
saw less than half the available
bandwidth there really is no saving
grace here in my opinion I mean I am
these intention was obviously to feed
the OEM channels with these rubbish
chips and get rid of them and it seems
now they're just trying to buy a bit of
time before the Zen based ap use arrive
next year and they're probably trying to
push these on the back of the success
that rise ins had but in my opinion
never really just tainted the a m4
platform with an architecture we'd all
just like to forget and I would have
thought AMD pretty much felt the same
way anyway my advice is simple just
don't buy these chips they're really
just garbage and I know that sounds
harsh but well that's my honest opinion
so wait for the real deal as I do expect
the Zen based AP used to really be
something quite special and they will no
doubt give Intel quite a few headaches
that's gonna do it for this one I'm your
host Steve see you next time guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
