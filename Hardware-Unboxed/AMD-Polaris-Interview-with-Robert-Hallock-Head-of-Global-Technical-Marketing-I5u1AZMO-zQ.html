i'm your host man as always and today at
the privilege of an interview with
robert Haluk and he is the head of
global technical marketing at AMD thanks
for making one trip hey thank you
earlier this month Andy shocked and
press everyone with a 19 USD price tag
and announcement of the Ark's for ID
what can you tell us about the other lot
of space reviews been released last one
Turk there there are two other color
space GPUs of course there's the RX 40
on top but below that there's the RX 470
which is based on the same chip as the
40 no and then below that there's the RX
for 60 which is based on a chip we would
call Polaris 11 the other two based on
flares 10 which is larger haven't ended
arrived the RX monaco and it's not a
special manual yeah so when we had the r
7 and r 9 i think it was hard for gamers
to identify i'll even take a step back
when we originally conceived of our 7
and r 9 we kind of thought it would work
like automobiles where you have
different categories of car no and that
works okay for automobiles but maybe
didn't work out so well for GPUs um so
this time if it's a gaming card if we've
decided for gaming it will be our X 400
series if it's not the gaming card then
it would be just for hundreds so rating
on for something and and so we think
that this will be a simplification in
the branding make it easier for gamers
just everyday consumers who maybe don't
track this stuff very closely to go ah
this is for gaming this one's not so
sunny slope sense so why at this time
sandy sure is not conveyed directly the
10 17 1080 cards from video yeah that's
the big question right um if you look at
the market there are millions of GPU
shipped every year
and it specifically the ones that people
would buy off the shelf to integrate
into a system and eighty-five percent of
all those GPUs are between 100 and 300
dollars eighty-five percent so while
it's fun to talk about a very high-end
GP like the radeon r9 3x or similar you
know the reality is that's less than
twenty percent of the market and so for
us as a company looking to grow or
influence the market grow up market
share capture more users the best way to
do that is to make GPUs between one a
few hundred bucks and that kind of led
us directly to where Polaris is entering
the market so one of the improvements in
efficiency come from within your Polacks
comes yeah so depending on what part you
look at it it's up to about 2.8 2.8
times the performance efficiency versus
the types of products radeon products
that consumers would have today and then
compute unit in our product we've raised
performance by about fifteen percent so
there are many see use inside a graphics
card and each one now produces about
fifteen percent more versus what we've
had all of that comes from a couple
areas the big one is the transition to
40 nanometer FinFET at globalfoundries
so every little transistor in the chip
is now much smaller than it was on our
previous gen and 28nm eater products
that's a big help you know the smaller
you can make a transistor the less it
makes electrons in the surrounding
environment more power efficient you are
overall but that only got us to about
1.7 of the 2.8 so the other you know 1.1
is Amy technologies in laying out the
transistors better inside the chip
finding unique ways to account for you
know if you have a product that is take
the 480 there's a range of ways that the
480 can behave
from the best version to the worst
version and normally we'd have to build
in market to those products to to ensure
that all the products are consistent but
through our physical design
optimizations we've been able to
significantly shrink that march in part
to part two part and that allows us to
get the higher clock speeds or a voltage
lower power usage overall and that's how
we got to the 2.8 number by being
smarter about the way the chip is
designed okay hearing that HD offing
yeah first of all what is it omar's know
nothing about and how plus photo sure so
HDR is high dynamic range and it's the
idea that we would try to create
displays that are capable of recreating
the full diversity of what the human eye
can see we see billions of colors we see
tons of steps of brightness between pure
black and pure white in other 24 some
say 42 steps of brightness between pure
black and pure white that the human eye
can see and so how do we capture all of
that all of the the majesty of the human
eye on a display that's what HDR is for
we're trying to get from about 17
million colors today on the minimal
display to over a billion colors it's
still not close to what the human eye
can do that's only about 75% of human
vision but a billion is a lot better
than 17 million and that particularly
improves gold red and cyan and brightly
lit really colourful games would be much
more colorful and more accurately
colored than they are today contrast is
also a big one how do we make a darkly
dimly lit seen in a game there's lots of
those that look just as the
as a daily seen in a game if we can make
the contrast contrast better than this
color gray versus that color gray could
be a lot more distinct and a lot more
noticeable and and so you know we can we
can finally make these darkly lit scenes
look just as good as a daylight one and
you put all of that together more colors
or contrast brighter displays more
accurate displays and that's HDR and you
know if you're the kind of person who is
really passionate about monitors no it
is the window into your experience of
gaming then HDR is far away the best
upgrade I've ever seen you know if you
if you were the kind of person says I
have to have an IPS monitor or refuse to
buy a TN monitor you're the kind of guy
who wants HDR it's just breathtaking so
stop asad with the enormous an
undeniable difference undeniable awesome
photo say it at one hundred and ninety
nine dollars what's what kind of VR
experience can use these experience yeah
so our goal was to take you know what is
sort of 350 to 500 bucks now this this
validated HTC vive or oculus rift sort
of GPU and take that cost out to 199
right so we're talking still 19 FPS
smoothness we're talking no drop frames
of judder a dotting you know the full
diversity of the content available
those ecosystem now it's at a
two-hundred-dollar graphics card instead
of 350 to 500 that's the kind of
experience we're talking about great so
the full experience patron of us that's
right with other the lower costs in the
form of series that you mentioned before
they always put they are to the road you
know somewhat similar experience yeah
that's a great question so we sort of
see the opportunity for different
classes of VR experience you know in the
same way that there are different
classes of consoles out today you had
intended we for example which was more
simpler more simple sort of graphics and
then you have something like the
PlayStation 4 the xbox one which is a
lot more advanced graphics but nobody
can say that any of those consoles
aren't fun right and nobody can say that
the people who play those are gamers
right it's just different and so we see
an opportunity with a product like the
radeon RX 460 the to run that that less
graphically demanding class of content
still at 90 frames per second sill
buttery smooth still no drop frames and
it's you know when we can realize that
collectively as an industry you know us
with the hardware HMV's users then
that's I think a huge opportunity for
the VR market to explode and take off
okay sorry times I expecting many
upcoming directives 12 games to utilize
a sim compute sorry things will give
Amy's fourth generation gcn graphics
cards the advantage
videos new generation of talents sure
well it's worth defining a synchronous
computer right no historically in
graphics API is like Arctic's 11 or
opengl on other graphics architecture is
everything that the GPU would do from
the time its apps to ask to render a
picture to the time it comes out on the
screen custom is done step by step by
step so if you are asked to put a light
on the screen well first you have to ask
it to put the light on the screen and
you have to determine what that light is
going to look like and then you actually
have to render it out but a lot of that
stuff could be done in parallel like the
setup for one thing and the execution of
another could all be done in parallel
and that's the idea of asynchronous
compute multiple queues working together
so it's a big performance boost for us
you know we've seen gains up to twenty
or thirty percent with this feature
active so looking into the future or
talking to talking about games like deus
ex human revolution I'm sorry mankind
divided we're talking about civilization
six battlefield one these are huge
titles in in their respective space and
we're talking about a synchronous
compete in all of them and so I think a
really fundamentally powerful
performance changing experience or
technology for people sure so I know a
lot of people may be wondering will
these flowers cards be supporting
actually mine two point oh yeah we did
address that concern from radeon r9 fury
x and these products will support hdmi
to and specifically hdmi to point B for
HDR support as well but that's kind of
just one of many things that we've done
to go to future-proof this product we
know that people want to build home
theater PC s before Katie vs so yeah we
add an hdmi to point B but there's also
a lot of higher resolution
and higher refresh rate monitors coming
that are going to use DisplayPort 1.3
that's in this product as well they're
obviously game streaming or game
recording is really really popular if
those services transition over to h.265
encoding to save bitrate we have an
h.265 encoder in hardware for games and
as streaming video services like Netflix
and Amazon transition over to HDR we
have an HD already decoder built into
the chip so there aren't really any
standards or specification looming on
the horizon six months out of 12 months
out that this card can't handle it won't
be ready to be compatible with and I
think that's really important for gamers
in this particular one to three hundred
dollar price band because they only
upgrade every two to four years yeah so
having a full complement of kind of
future ready technologies it's going to
be really important for people yep then
I'm into wire that buying or outside
exactly Oh beautiful so I see the cool
is actually what longer than the board
on this for any other organ is so yeah
great question so on the 484 7460 will
allow our board partners like sapphire
and Asus actually make custom designs
and they would be allowed to produce a
crew that's only as long as the PCB yeah
but on our reference design we have sort
of a different challenge you know we
sell a lot of these cards into OEM
there's like HP and Dell and and they
exclusively want blower designs right so
they have to be longer so our reference
design it's a blower but AMD's will be
able to fully customize supports as well
excellent is there a 2560 stream process
a plus-10 pot coming or 480 or using the
full silicon the the 40 the shader
configuration is the full configuration
at the detention right so no marks still
is easy um a little question what we
call the new jcn Jason 1.3 1.4 yeah
that's that's a fun
story so all credit to an antec in north
america for coming up with the numbering
scheme that everybody know uses but in
internally at AMD we've never had really
an internal numbering scheme to address
one GCM versus another we've always
talked about it in terms of actual code
names like te which most users when i
was in 7970 was GCM 1.0 and then we went
to bonaire which is the radeon 7790 or
the r7 260 that was 1.1 and then
products like fiji better known as the
theory x or Tonga the 285 those would be
G San 1.2 and finally here we are today
with players since we had no official
names previously and we know people
really want one we've been easy to talk
about we're calling this the fourth gen
of graphics core next row so you can
kind of work backwards from there and
figure out what the other generations
are so finally let official name that's
one of many times do people I so last
one sir will the pliers GPUs utilizing
this little boost clock time feature yep
actually uh products on the Shelf will
have a base clock and it meant o'clock
and people will see that excellent we
look forward to finding out what kind of
frequencies are running up shortly all
right well thanks for making the long
logitech tutorial your melbourne
australia my viewers we're going to be
giving away one of these are explore IDs
so stay tuned for that and more watching
you content thanks a lot hey thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
