I'm your host Matt and today we're gonna
be taking a look at the Cougar 500k
gaming keyboard the Cougar 500k is the
latest keyboard in the cooter line and
the first ones use membrane switches
unlike 600 K and the 700 K before it we
spray to use mechanical switches let's
top it open and take a look right
Cougars packed it in pretty tight for us
you're the national top firm here which
keeps the keyboard secure and the rest
is held in place with some nice black
foam first thing you pull out is the
economic time rest and it's got this
little magnetically attached add-on
called the FPS palm rest in to give you
rest a little bit more elevation to get
to the WASD Keys it's got a nice
rubberized feel it's sort of a honeycomb
texture
I have two dudes a gaming keyboard it
does have five programmable keys down
the left side and the six programmable
key is actually a split spacebar the
keyboard also has onboard memory where
it stores you three different profiles
that you can switch between on the fly
across the top here the palm rest clips
are nice and easy like so over the
Cougar logo with a thin fun protective
piece of plastic that we get to peel off
and you once the whole keyboards
led-backlit to and you can switch
between lighting modes with just simple
press of the button right up the top
here we've also got a dedicated windows
lock key and media keys across the top
right play pause stop previous/next and
you've also got your volume controls at
the top right corner to cruise also
included a USB pass-through which is
pretty handy for plugging in your phone
or mouse or thumb drive or any other USB
device last Guti in the box

few different stickers you can stick any
case or similar and this little
instruction manual this is Ben Matt from
