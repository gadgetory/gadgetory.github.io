time from the top five video and for
this one we're taking a look at GPUs
it's been about a year since we lasted
an update to this top 5 GPU series and
in fact last time we did one you
couldn't really buy a graphics card
there was pretty much nothing in stock
and prices were massively inflated so
yeah really time that we update this
series it's very much overdue at this
point so we have 5 categories for this
one covering numerous price ranges so
there really should be something for
everyone so without waste any more time
let's get into it first that we have the
best entry-level GPU and a year ago I
went with the GeForce GT 1030 because at
the time it was faster than the rx 550
at least for the most part it did
consume slightly less power it
overclocked better and it was actually
more affordable however it wasn't that
long before aim do you got their drivers
sorted out in the rx 550 I hit the lead
it's technically a superior product
anyway so there's really no reason why
it shouldn't dominate the GT 1030 and
thankfully today it does on top of that
I'd probably scrub the GT 1030 anyway as
it's become a bit of a disgraced product
now that video is quietly pushed out the
ddr4 versions and that did catch some
gamers out providing them with a vastly
inferior product for the same price the
horrible ddr4 versions range from $60 us
right up to 135 dollars and it really is
difficult for gamers to know which one
they're getting especially if they don't
notice specifically seek out the gddr5
model which they wouldn't know to do if
they did their research when the GT 1030
first came out and in fact even today
there isn't a whole lot of information
about the ddr4 versions if you go to
research GT 1030 performance you're
likely going to find a review that's
based on the gddr5 version and that is a
big problem and for this we did label
this as a disgusting movie Nvidia and
well we stand by that
AMD's of course made a few branding
blunders as well this year and don't
worry we have pulled them up on those as
well
in separate videos and we'll be touching
on those again in another video very
shortly anyway the rx 550 is only around
$10 more on average and we found it
offer superior performance in a number
of titles we suggest looking at models
priced at or below $90 us and all rx 550
models will deliver a similar level of
performance so again focus on price in
my last top 5 GPU video I recommended
the GTX 1050 Ti is the best mid-range
graphics card and this was because their
radio and GPUs but overpriced at the
time I commented that normally I would
opt for the rx 570 at the $170 u.s. MSRP
and back then they were selling for an
insane 260 dollars u.s. making them a
bit of a hard pass today the rx 570 is
selling for as low as $140 u.s. which is
completely insane
the good kind of insane of course and
the reason why Tim featured it in his
1080p ultimate valued gaming build if
you can't locate one for the 140 WS
price there are only a few selling at
that really low price right now and
you'll easily be able to get one $450
us's there are quite a few models of the
RS 570 selling for that price so getting
one in time for Christmas shouldn't be
that difficult alternatively if you
don't want the radeon GPU you can get a
gtx 1050 TI for about $150 u.s. so it's
a pretty decent backup though i would go
with the rx 570 personally as it offers
vastly superior performance in most
titles including recently released
tunnels such as battlefield 5 and hitman
2 so this really should be your number
one choice for those of you wanting to
spend even less money there is the gtx
1050 and RX 560 and they're both pretty
good options the RX 560 can typically be
had $420 us and then the gtx 1054 about
$130 u.s. so with just $10 u.s. between
them my preference would be for the gtx
1050 though it's fair to say that both
do provide a similar bang for your buck
and that said it would be well worth
spending a little bit extra to get the
rx 570 as it is significantly more
capable than either the rx 560 or GTX 10
gamer's looking to spend between 120 and
300 dollars u.s. have a few options to
choose from though there are only three
GPU choices here you can get a GeForce
GTX 1060 with either three gigabytes or
six gigabytes of memory and technically
they are two different GPUs as the three
gigabyte version is slightly cut down
then we have the RX 5 value which can be
configure with either 4 gigabytes or 8
gigabytes in memory and you're actually
getting the same GPU with either memory
configuration last time I went with the
3 gigabyte GTX 1060 s offered the best
value thanks to inflated pricing of the
Radeon GPUs as well as the 60 byte 1060
is that was a more popular choice
amongst minors that said my preference
would have been for the rx 580 at $200
for the 4 gigabyte version or $230 for
the 8 gigabyte model at least those are
the MSRP
sadly back then the 8 gigabyte model was
selling for an insane 310 dollars u.s.
making it a complete write-off today
though the 8 gigabyte model can be had
for as little as $200 u.s. and oddly the
4 gigabyte models are actually more
expensive at least at the time of
filming in any case $200 for an Rx 580
is an amazing Buy especially considering
that the gtx 1066 cubot models cost at
least $30 more and are for the most part
slightly slower the $200 RX 588 gigabyte
models also make aimed his new Radeon rx
590 the most pointless practice on the
market right now $280 for single digit
gains yeah that doesn't really make
sense so no thanks on that one AMD I
expect some price drops for those parts
in the not-too-distant future because
well they sure as hell aren't selling at
their current price
this has traditionally been a sub $400
us category a targeting 1440p gaming so
that kind of scrubs out the new r-tx
2070 leaving us with Vega 56 and then
the outgoing and gtx 1070 TI there is a
single vega 64 card selling for $400 us
right now but most apprised a lot closer
to $500 us and therefore you just get an
RT ex 2070 and that would certainly be
my number one choice at that price point
for less than $400 it's a bit tough and
a pick which one to go with whether it's
vega 56 or the gtx 1070 TI but
ultimately I'm going with the GeForce
graphics card on this one by and large
the GeForce GPU offers the best
performance it's faster out of the box
in the vast majority of tiles it clocks
better runs cooler and it consumes less
power
right now the GTX 1070 I can be had for
as little as $350 us and getting one for
$400 or less is very easily done so
don't expect to pay more than $400 for
gtx 1070 TI at least while stock last s'
picking up a Vega 56 graphics card for
under $400 is significantly more
challenging and with most models priced
sort of mid to high $400 range at that
price point you really are better off
getting our TX 2070
well from the r-tx 2070 and up it's
pretty much in video all day the r-tx
2080 certainly has no competition and
then the 2082 eye is Farhad in front of
pretty much anything anybody has to
offer right now so a bit of an
unfortunate situation hopefully that can
be somewhat corrected in 2019 but for
now if you've got a heap of money
burning a hole in your wallet and you're
pretty much going to dump that on an
NVIDIA GPU and when it comes to 4k
gaming you really want at least an RT X
2080 or GT X 1080 Ti so you can't really
buy the 1080p is brand-new anymore and
if your budget allows that then there's
nothing quite like an RT X xx atti for
the 2080 ti right now availability is
pretty poor reliability still a little
bit questionable the price is absolutely
horrendous and on top of all of that ray
tracing and DL SS look to be a bit of a
bust for the most part my boy oh boy is
the 4k performance absolutely glorious
it's a situation where I know I'm
getting robbed but I'm kind of happy to
let it happen because damn that 4k
gaming with over 60 fps in titles such
as rise of the Tomb Raider and
battlefield 5 yeah it really is
something to behold I'm a bit ashamed of
myself but if you try it out one of
those 4k 144 Hertz
HDR monitors with an RT X 20 atti you'd
probably understand it's pretty clear
that AMD is doing their best to remain
competitive where they can and right now
that is at the lower end of the market
but they seem to have it all pretty well
stitched up there around $100 the rx 550
is a must for a hundred and fifty
dollars day rx 570 is an incredible Buy
pretty much the best value all-rounder
there fortuna' dollars us though you
really can't go past the rx 580 though I
would sort of argue that it's probably
not worth $50 more over the 570 but in
any case if you've got to roll suspend
and that is your best option there for
between 300 and $400 us the gtx 1070 TI
seems like an obvious choice and then
once we go over $400 us well it's pretty
much all in video well that is going to
do it for this one if you like the video
you know what to do and if you feel we
got any of these pics wrong then
you also know what to do leave a polite
