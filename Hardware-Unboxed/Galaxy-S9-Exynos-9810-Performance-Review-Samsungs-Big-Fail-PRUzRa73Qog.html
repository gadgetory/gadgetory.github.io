I'm diving into smartphones once again
this time looking at the performance of
the samsung galaxy s 9 plus in the
previous video I looked at the battery
life of the Exynos tomorrow so check
that out if you haven't already here
I'll be exploring all aspects of the SOC
s performance including actual real
world smartphone benchmarks not just
your usual synthetic workloads as well
as some storage performance before
getting into the numbers it's good to
have an idea of the hardware inside this
flagship phone as with previous samsung
galaxy s devices there are two variants
of the galaxy s 9 and galaxy s 9 plus 1
has the Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 for the
United States China Japan and a few
other regions while the other variant
has the Samsung Exynos 9 8 10 for the
rest of the worlds I would love to be
able to test both devices at some point
but for now we have our hands on just
the Exynos model so the following
performance analysis is focused on the
new Exynos SOC the Exynos 9 8 10 is the
successor to the Exynos 88-90 5 that
first appeared in the galaxy s 8 we're
still looking at a dual quad-core
implementation just with newer core
architectures improved clock speeds and
more cash the big performance cores are
using the Exynos m3 design which is a
much wider core design with significant
IPC improvements over the Exynos m2 in
the 88 95 there are four of these cores
and they are clocked up to 2.7 gigahertz
in single core workloads while sitting
at 2.3 gigahertz in dual core loads and
1.8 gigahertz in all core workloads this
tiered clock speed setup is very
reminiscent of x86 chips from Intel and
AMD but it's relatively rare in arm SOC
s at least at the moment complementing
the big cores are for smaller efficiency
cause that use the cortex a 55 design
clocked up to 1.8 gigahertz this is a
small upgrade on the cortex a53 so used
in the 88 95 along with the 100
megahertz clock speed increase on the
GPU front Samsung has moved from am Ali
G 71 mph
20 at 546 megahertz to am Ali G 72 mph
and 572 megahertz in other words we're
seeing two fewer cause than in the 88 95
but at a higher clock and using a newer
design the memory controller remains the
same quad 16-bit lpddr4 X controller
providing twenty eight point seven
gigabytes per second of bandwidth
whenever you see a new SOC used in the
smartphone that iterates on its powerful
predecessor you typically expect better
performance however with the Exodus nine
eight ten in the Samsung Galaxy S nine
that's not really the cases we'll
explore in both synthetic and real-world
benchmarks and yeah that's right we are
now using real-world performance
benchmarks to measure smartphone
performance just to give you a better
idea than you might get otherwise with
some of the synthetic workloads so let's
kick things off by looking at browser
performance in octane and Kraken here we
see a decent performance improvement of
around 25% for the Galaxy S nine plus in
octane relative to the Galaxy S 8 plus
however surprisingly it does fall behind
in cracking to the tune of 17 percent
and that's not the best start for an SOC
that supposedly has more than a 50% IPC
gain in bass mark web 3.0 the Galaxy S 9
plus is a decent 19 percent faster than
the Galaxy S 8 plus with the largest
gains seen in a generic suite however
performance is no better than a device
with the last generation 835 inside
which is a concern for a newer SOC that
is being shipped alongside the
snapdragon 845 variant in PC Mark we're
seeing relatively modest performance
gains using the original work test the
Exynos 9 and 10 in the galaxy s 9 plus
is just four percent faster than the
Exynos edit 95 looking at the overall
score which breaks down into 16 percent
faster in the web test 22 percent faster
in the video test 18 percent slower in
the writing test and 3 percent faster in
the photo test in this benchmark the
galaxy s 9 plus gets badly beaten by the
pixel to excel with its last generation
Snapdragon 835 SOC looking at the new
work 2 ponyo test and it's still not
great news for the galaxy s 9 plus with
justice
percent performance gain again it gets
handily beaten by the Senate during 8:35
by around 25% in Basemark OS 22.0
interesting our benchmark now in there
but the galaxy's 8 plus actually
outperforms the galaxy s 9 plus by 14%
in the overall score even though the
Exynos 9 and 10
does eke out a win in the cpu heavy
system score to the tune of 20% again
not a great result for the newer Galaxy
S 9 Plus in its x9 8/10 especially
considering it's bitten by the
Snapdragon 835 once more as these are
just synthetic results I did want to
examine whether we're getting any
performance gains with the excellence 9
810 in real-world applications so I went
back and retested a collection of
smartphones in a range of widely used
Play Store apps unfortunately I don't
have data for the Exynos 88-90 5 in
these apps by can compare the Exynos 9
at 10 to the Snapdragon 835 so we'll
start with Pixlr which is a popular
photo editing app and here I'm
benchmarking the time it takes to save a
large image with a filter applied the
effect is applied at full resolution
during the save process so a faster SOC
can apply the effect more quickly and
complete the save faster in this test
the excellence 9:18 is a decent 20%
faster than the Snapdragon a 35 in the
pixel to excel excel benchmark is a very
basic column sort of a large file with
60,000 plus rows the galaxy s 9 plus is
13% faster at complaining this sort than
the pixel to excel though the HTC u 11
using the same SOC does close this gap
to just 7% not a resounding win for the
X nos 9 and 10 but it is better than
nothing
when fully loading a PDF in Acrobat
Reader the galaxy s 9 plus with the
Exynos 9 a 10 is again around 20% faster
than the pixel to excel with its
snapdragon 835 and decent performance
improvement but it doesn't establish the
externals chip as the outright fastest
on the market with the last gen current
960 coming in very close the final
benchmark we'll be unveiling today is
Rowdy compression here the Exynos 9
10 was actually 18 percent slower than
the Snapdragon 835 in the pixel to excel
and that's a disappointing result for
the X not 9 8 10 moving into graphics
performance and again for the most part
we're seeing relatively modest
performance improvements moving from the
exodus and at 95 to the Exynos nine
eight ten in the GFX bench Manhattan 3.1
test we're looking at an 8% performance
improvement in favor of the X nos 9 8 10
in the off-screen tests and 14 percent
in the on screen test
however in better news for the external
Schneider 10 it does manage to
outperform the Snapdragon 835 with its
Audrina 540 GPU to the tune of 22
percent in the off-screen workload it's
not as good news for the external
antenna in 3dmark sling shot benchmark
in the standard sling shot unlimited
test the externals 9 and 10 is slightly
slower than the X naught and at 95 in
the overall score and a sizable 19%
behind the Snapdragon 835 the contest
does even up in slingshot extreme
unlimited the 9 8 10 is 4% behind the
Snapdragon 35 and 5% ahead of the Exynos
88-90 5 the final graphics benchmark
we're looking at is the base mark you
bow test which has heavily favored Maui
GPS in the past here the X naught 9 8 10
in the galaxy s 9 plus is 14% faster
than the Exynos 88-90 5 allowing to take
a massive performance lead over the
Snapdragon 835 this is one of the few
crushing victories for excellence 9 8 10
relative to the last gen Snapdragon 835
while the excellence 9 8 10 is
competitive against the Snapdragon 835
in graphics workloads and beats it in
the case of GFX bench and base mark the
SOC does throttle heavily in the galaxy
s 9 Plus is chassis after 25 minutes of
consecutive GFX benched 3.1 runs the
exes 9 a 1000 was by 42% leading to a
score reduction that actually placed it
slower than the pixel to excel in
long-term graphics workloads the pixel
to excel and it's Snapdragon 805 doesn't
throttle as heavily so it produces
better long-term performance the results
from both the CPU GPU and real-world
tests are pretty interesting in my
opinion for the
most part the excellence nine and ten
produces disappointing performance that
either narrowly beats or merely equals
the Snapdragon a 35 which is Qualcomm's
last generation silicon it's clear that
the Snapdragon 805 variant of the galaxy
s 9 plus is the one to get if possible
as it produces performance more in line
with what we'd expect from a 20-18
SOC at least going on reviews that have
tested this model lower than expected
performance poses an interesting
question as to what Samsung deal with
the Exynos 9 at 10 in the galaxy s 9
plus luckily the folks in turn and tech
have dug into the issue uncovering
mostly software and firmware related
problems with the X nas morale there's
some great analysis on the matter and
you really should read that if you're
interested but I'll summarize it here as
two major problems Samsung uses a hot
plugging mechanism for thread migrations
between course which is inefficient and
the scheduler is tuned such that the CPU
takes a long time to reach its maximum
frequency ideally the CPU reaches peak
performance as quickly as possible
completes the task in a shorter period
of time then shuts off to conserve power
the extra lost 9 and 10 in the Galaxy S
9 Plus appears to slowly ramp up its
maximum frequency which causes it to
underwhelm in short workloads in terms
of storage performance in the Galaxy S 9
plus and I have a 64 gig mole to review
perform as well although it doesn't set
new records for NAND performance and
can't match the latest Huawei devices
sequential performance is strong with
improvements to both reads and writes
compared to the Galaxy S 8 plus however
randa performance remains a weak point
with fairly average speeds for a
high-end Android smartphone so if you're
thinking of buying the Galaxy S 9 plus I
definitely recommend the snapdragon 845
model if it's available in your area if
you only have access to the Exynos 910
variant just know that you won't really
be getting next-generation performance
and will be stuck with little to no
upgrades over the Exynos Galaxy S A+ or
other snapdragon 835 phones I'd only
advise an upgrade presuming you're most
interested in performance from something
two years old or even older at this
point alternatively wait until there are
a few more high-performance snap during
eight forty five phones on the market
which should be the case in the coming
months that's it for this look into
galaxy s 9 plus performance with the X
noise model don't forget to check out
the entire review of this phone on text
box if you interested camera display
