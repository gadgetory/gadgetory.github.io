we got our first look at the 29 20 X and
then the 29 70 WX processors and for
that initial review the focus really was
on productivity performance but I did
promise that soon after we would look we
would dive a bit deeper into the gaming
performance so that's what we're doing
today unfortunately though I still
haven't had time to update the sky like
X CPUs with many of the newly released
tiles that we will be looking at in this
video but there have been plenty of
comparisons in the past on the channel
comparing the 1920 X to 1950 X and even
the 2950 X with a whole heap of skylake
X CPU so it's not like we haven't seen
that data before but I admit it would
have been nice if I had have had time to
update but just adding one CPU to the
Lister's a day or so is worth of testing
so forgive me but I think what we have
is still very useful anyway the focus
here is to see how well the 24 core and
32 core models work with the new dynamic
local mode and I should note that all
the testing has been conducted with this
new mode enabled since it doesn't
require a restart I'm happy to test and
even recommend this mode whereas I
wasn't really a fan of the game mode as
it requires a reset and basically nerfs
the processors productivity performance
so if you primarily require a
workstation computer but wouldn't mind
also using it to blow off some steam by
playing a few games every now and then
how well does that actually work and
assuming you're not a high refresh rate
gamer looking to play something like
csgo competitively on your workstation
PC does gaming on a thread Ripper rig
even matter in order to find that out
I'll be testing at 1440p and 4k with an
RT x 2080 TI
in addition to the CPU limited 1080p
testing please note all systems work and
figure with ddr4 3200 CL 14 memory and
the quad channel platforms received
32-year bytes while the dual channel
systems use 16 gigabytes ok let's get in
the results first up we have Forza
horizon 4 which isn't a CPU intensive
title but we deliberately test with it
to show how these CPUs compare in a
typical game as most gamers aren't
heavily CPU bound using high-end modern
processors as you can see it too
the Red River CPUs all deliver
comparable frame time and average frame
rate performance which is interesting as
the rise in seven 2,700 X is around 7%
faster matching the performance of the
Intel CPUs that said at 1440p the 2,700
X is no longer able to keep pace with
the Intel CPUs not something you'd
expect to see given the results at 30 P
the Intel CPUs are up to 6 percent
faster but with all the processors
enabling over 100 FPS at all times with
an RT X xx atti
the performance margin is almost
meaningless then at 4 K we find the
playing field is pretty well neutralized
as all eight processors allowed the RT X
xx atti to achieve maximum performance
at this extreme resolution next up we
have Star Wars Battlefront 2 which is a
CPU intensive title and here the thread
room for 2970 W X is able to keep pace
with the 29:20 X and 2150 X while the
29:20 WX still trips up Windows 10 with
its many threads for all other thread
Ripper CPUs frame time performance is on
par or slightly better than that of the
2700 X that's said at 1080p the 29:20 X
and 2970 X around 17% slower than the 99
or ek moving up to 1440p and already we
see that 17% margin come down to just 5%
and now the thread Ripper CPUs are
reliable to match the 2,700 X basically
using these quality settings with an RT
X 2082 I it's near impossible to
differentiate between the 1,900 can say
the 29:20 x even with a live FPS counter
then at 4k as you might expect there
really is no difference between these
CPUs they basically all deliver the same
frame time and average framerate
performance so while battlefront 2 is a
CPU demanding title by the time you
reach the 4k resolution it becomes
significantly more GPU bound even with
the latest and greatest GPU next up we
have battlefield 1 and this title has
been causing some grief with the GeForce
r-tx 20 atti
I've noticed that the last few drivers
have been causing some odd performance
behavior in this title not quite sure
what's going on but it will require some
further investigation previously with
the gtx 10a DTI the stock core i7 87 ok
allowed for a 1% lower result of around
135 FPS but now with the RT X xx atti
we've dropped down to 118 fps then we
also have some really
odd results with the new eight core
ninth gem processors we're moving to
1440p and I'll touch on that in a moment
anyway here at 1080p we see the thread
Ripper CPUs aren't that well utilized
and even the 2950 X came in well behind
to the 2700 X meanwhile the Intel CPUs
are noticeably faster and please note
the 200 FPS frame cap has actually been
removed and just so happens that the
9900 K in 9700 K averaged 200 FPS now
1440p or CPU see a huge decrease in
frame time performance with the
exception of the 99 K and 9700 K which
see a performance increase this makes
absolutely no sense and for now I
suspect this is a bug with the Nvidia
display driver anyway the 2700 X remains
just ahead of the thread river cpus
which means AMD's trailing Intel by a
reasonable margin in this title that
said at 4k we do see once again a coming
together of the results another thread
repressive views are basically able to
match the performance of the 99 or okay
at least when looking at the average
frame rate moving on we have project
cars - and here we find very competitive
performance between the 87 RK and 2700 X
the new 9900 K and 9700 K enable
breathtaking performance with the RT X
2082 at 1080p pushing up over 150 fps
making them around 35% faster than the
2700 X the thread Ripper CPUs do enable
highly playable performance but compared
to the mainstream Intel alternatives you
can see why we've stressed that these
aren't gaming CPUs still for casual
gaming they are more than capable and we
see that both the 29:20 X and 2970 WX
are still able to match the 2950 X
moving to 1440 Payne here we set the
Rison 720 700 X is able to hang with the
GPU limited Intel competition but we do
see some drop-off for the average frame
rate with the thread Ripper models still
the frame time performance is impressive
now for K we find pretty similar
performance across the board frame time
performance is still a little down on
the thread refer parts but we're only
talking a few frames here overall the
experience will be very much the same so
project cars 2 is certainly a pass for
the thread Ripper CPUs Tom Clancy's
Rainbow six siege is mostly GPU bound
with a 90 X 20 atti that said you'll
still want a decent CP you to play this
title at 1080p the thread Ripper CPUs do
surprisingly well and basically match
the 2700 X which means they're just 17%
slower than the Intel CPUs for the
average framerate given that we are
seeing well over 170 FPS at all times
you have to wonder how much these
margins even matter we do see a bit of a
performance drop-off in frame time
performance for the 24 core and 32 core
parts at 1440p that said both still did
allow for over 100 FPS at all times
the 29 20 X match the 2,700 X while the
29 50 X was a whisker faster basically
matching the Intel CPUs finish it expect
once again we do see a coming together
at 4k that said the 24 core and 32 core
parts still really struggle with frame
time performance the results aren't bad
but there is a noticeable drop-off when
compared to the rest of the CPUs tested
next up we have hitman and here we have
another toilet doesn't play particularly
well on the 2970 WX and 2990 WX even
with the dynamic local mode enabled the
game was playable but you're looking at
a much more enjoyable experience with
the 29 20x and twenty-nine 50x both of
which were able to match the 2,700 X
that said the Intel CPU still offer
vastly superior performance in this
title at tourney P at 1440p the Intel
CPU still remained well ahead especially
when looking at the average framerate
performance still the 29:20 X 29 50 X
and 2,700 X were all acceptable it was
only the WX series that dipped into
trouble even at 4k we see until still
enjoys a performance advantage a small
one but still there is a slight
performance advantage there and that and
that isn't something we'd expect to see
in what should be an extremely GPU bound
scenario I do suspect that this is an
Nvidia display driver issue using the
DirectX 12 API but again I haven't
confirmed that some more testing and
will need to be done testing the shutter
of the Tomb Raider we see at the 29 20 X
and 29 50 X match the frame time
performance of the 2,700 X while beating
it by a reasonable margin for the
average frame rate so it's interesting
to see the 12 and 16 core thread Ripper
CPUs offering a performance increase
here over the 2,700 X which I have to
say was most
expected however once we move to 1440p
the 2700 X is now able to roughly match
the average frame rate of these river /
CPUs while offering slightly better
frame time performance though overall
the performance was very much the same
between the 29:20 X 2150 X and 2700 X
they were certainly all comparable with
the 99er okay as we are mostly GPU bound
here again even with the dynamic local
mode enabled we are seeing some serious
frame time issues with the 2970 WX and
2990 WX processors then as expected the
4k resolution we are very much GPU bound
and with the exception of the 24 core
and 32 core models all CPUs enabled the
same level of performance wrapping up
the gaming benchmarks we have Assassin's
Creed Odyssey and here we have some very
interesting results the previous
Assassin's Creed origins and very much
liked a lot of cos and Odyssey appears
to be no different here we see at 1080p
that the 2950 x and 29:20 x are both
quite a bit faster than the Rison 720
700 X not only that but they offer
slightly better frame time performance
than the Intel CPUs despite a slightly
lower average framerate
unfortunately the 2970 WX and 2990 WX do
suffer quite a lot when it comes to the
frame time performance despite offering
very respectable average frame rates at
1440p we are almost entirely GPU bound
and here there's very little separating
the 29 50 X 29 28 and 2,700 X as well as
the Intel CPUs frame time performance
for the 24 core and 32 core models is
still down a little bit but given how
GPU bound we are the impact wasn't huge
then at 4k we're 100% GPU bound and
there's really no margins worth talking
about here so if you're gaming at 4k
with what is currently the world's
fastest gaming GPU your choice of a
modern high-end CPU really doesn't
matter too much shocking conclusion time
guys the 87 okay 97 okay and 99 hurry K
are the best gaming CPUs certainly
better than the super core heavy
workstation CPUs from AMD now that
you've picked your jaw up off the floor
from that completely unbelievable
conclusion
obviously the point of this video wasn't
to work out what the best game
CPU is or if the thread Ripper CPUs can
take it to the 99 or okay in games
because you probably already know the
answer to those questions what I wanted
to know is how well the twenty nine
twenty X and twenty nine fifty X stack
up against the more mainstream processes
and modern titles and not just at low
CPU limited resolutions but also at
resolutions you're likely going to game
up with high-end hardware I also wanted
to see how well the 2970 WX and 2990 WX
work with dynamic local mode enabled I
guess the main reason to investigate
gaming performance is to just see how
viable it is after all if you want a
dedicated high refresh rate gaming
system then my primary recommendation is
the core i7 87 okay and I guess now if
you have money to burn and potentially
your dwelling then check out the 19900 K
however if you're building a workstation
to work on but he'd also like to unwind
and play a few games at night how viable
is gaming on a three ripper system well
as it turns out the 29 20 X and 29 50 X
are extremely viable oh this has
certainly been my experience over the
past year also with the 1950 X the 29 70
WX and 2990 WX a where for the most part
okay but overall performance is still a
bit mixed and the frame time performance
is well that certainly appears to be a
big issue in some of the titles that we
tested however if you're spending at
least well $1,300 us or up to $1,800 us
on just the CPU I have to imagine that
building a dedicated so core i7 87 ok
gaming rig like what I've actually done
probably isn't out of the question
in fact that's exactly what I've done
with the set piece but if I was to build
my own dreams on a PC it would be very
much like coffee Ripper this has a 29 50
X in it with at 8700 K so perfect a
couple of graphics cards some memory and
yeah you're good to go and then about
three grand worth of liquid cooling
alternatively you could build a risin 5
1600 system with the gtx 1070 TL that'll
certainly get the job done very nicely
and well if you're spending $1,800 a US
on a CPU like I said that kind of setup
probably would just be pocket change and
Tim actually built a system very similar
to that on the
in fact it did have a 1,600 Anna GTX
1070 TI and he claimed that that was the
ultimate bang for your buck 1440p gaming
rig so if Tim said it it must be true
and on a final note results like what we
saw in Assassin's Creed Odyssey are very
interesting to me and I wonder just how
long it's going to be before we start
seeing quite a few more titles that run
better on the 29:20 X and 2950 X when
compared to the more mainstream 2700 X
and I suppose even some of the six and
eight core Intel CPUs anyway I'll leave
you with that interesting thought if you
