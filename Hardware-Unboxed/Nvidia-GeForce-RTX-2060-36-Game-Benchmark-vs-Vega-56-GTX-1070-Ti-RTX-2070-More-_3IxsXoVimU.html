much delay I can finally bring you our
g-force r-tx 2060 coverage the first
round of reviews based on the Nvidia
foundation model they went out on the
seventh but sadly we weren't included
that on the 15th the RT X 2060 series
was officially released into the wild
and all major retailers began selling
them at or around these $350 us MSRP
ball partner cards could also be
reviewed on the 15th but since I only
got our samples the day before I decided
not to rush that one and a lot of you
expressed interest in not having us rush
well it wouldn't be day one coverage but
our delayed coverage and take a bit of
time to provide an in-depth benchmark
comparison that covers our whole Libre
games so that's what we've done
so hopefully this content will be
in-depth enough for you so today on the
menu we have a 36 game benchmark with
over a dozen different GPUs all have
been tested at 1080p and 1440p then we
have a number of big performance
breakdowns at the end of the video along
with the usual cost per frame stuff so
by the time you're done with this video
you should know exactly where the r-tx
2060 stands and what it has to offer
gamers but before we get to the
benchmarks today's video sponsor is
Skillshare the online learning community
where you can learn real-world skills
I've always found it easiest to learn by
watching others and with Skillshare you
can do exactly that as professionals
create project-based classes covering
topics such as design business
technology film photography and much
more it's a great resource for those
looking to improve their skill set
assure a passion or advance their
careers and the best bit is for the
first 500 viewers to sign up you will
get the first two months of Skillshare
premium for free so it doesn't get much
better than that
check the link in the video description
ok so a few quick notes before we get
into it on here for testing I have the
gigabyte RCX 2060 gaming OC pro nice
quick catchy name there and I also have
MSI's r-tx 2060 gaming Z both look
really great but since the gigabyte card
arrived first I'm going
use it for all the testing that's that I
will provide detailed reviews on both
models at a later date so this video
won't include stuff like thermals as
that is reserved for the graphics card
review as for the RT X 2060 GPU well it
is an interesting one whereas the RT X
2070 comes at an MSRP of $500 the RT X
2060 is 30% cheaper at 350 dollars and
you literally pack 17% fuel recruiter
cause that said the memory bus has been
cut down by 25% and given that it uses
the same four 10 gigabits per second GDI
six memory that also means memory bound
has been reduced by 25% still the RT X
2060 shouldn't be a great deal slower
than the 2070 so in terms of value it's
likely going to be a better value
product it's also priced to compete with
AMD's vega 56 so i'll be interesting to
see how those two compare getting on
with the benchmark results as usual
we're going to be discussing results for
a dozen of the games and then jump into
our performance breakdowns for this
video I will be focusing on the 1440p
data but for those interested in terry p
performance you can find all those
graphs via a link in the video
description just lastly the test system
used includes the kora 919 okay clocked
at 5 gigahertz with 32 gigabytes of ddr4
3200 memory as for the drivers were
using adrenalin 2019 Edition nineteen
point one point one for the Radeon GPUs
and game ready for 17 point 35 wher for
the GeForce GPUs ok let's get into the
results kick starting things we have
shadow of the Tomb Raider and here the
ITX 2060 was good for 63 FPS on average
using the highest in game quality preset
this placed it on par with the GeForce
GTX 1080 and Vega 64 making it just 5%
slower than the RT X 2070 it was also 9%
fast in the GTX 1070 Ti though just 3%
faster than value 56 moving on to
strange Brigade and here the RT x 2060
was good for 86 FPS on average which
meant it was just 15% slower than the
2070 this time it was also 7% slower
than Vega 56 though that is somewhat
unsurprising given how well this tunnel
runs on AMD Hardware still the 2060 did
edge at the gtx 1070 TI so overall
performance was very respectable next up
we have
battlefield 5 and again the r-tx 2060
performance very well this time trailing
the r-tx 2070 by a mere 4% margin this
meant it was able to beat the gtx 1070
TI and vega 56 so far i have to say the
2060 is making the 2070 look rather
pointless the 2070 does pull away when
testing with Sniper Elite 4 and here the
r-tx 2060 was 15% slower not a massive
margin given it cost 30% less but at
least the 2070 doesn't look quite as
pointless in this one also we again see
that the 2060 was just able to edge out
the gtx 1070 TI and vega 56 here we see
that monster hunter well plays quite
well with the ITX 2060 at 1440p and
using the highest quality preset we saw
an average of 54 FPS in our test and
they spent the 2060 was just a frame
slower on average when compared to vega
64 and the gtx 1080
it was also 4 to 5 FPS fast on the gtx
1072 and vega 56 while it was 11% slower
than the RT x 2070 so again another
solid result seen here the nuturing GPUs
don't stack up that well in warframe
when compared to their Pascal
predecessors the RT X 2070 for example
is 8% salt in the GTX 1080 while the RT
X 2060 was seen to be 6% slow on the gtx
1070 TI that said it was also just 2%
slower than vega 56 moving on we have
the just calls for numbers and here the
2060 average 59 FPS making it just a few
frames slower than the GTX 1080 and Vega
64 it was also just 11% slow in the RT X
2070 and Vega 64 liquid and
interestingly we see that frame time
performance was similar from the gtx
1070 right up to the 1080 moving on we
have the grand theft auto 5 results and
they're quite interesting here the RT x
2016 managed to roughly match the gtx
1080 and this minute was 6% faster than
the gtx 1070 TI once again it was also
just 10% slower than the RT x 2070 once
again making the 500l option a rather
pointless in my opinion the RT x 2060
again beat or rather matched the gtx
1080 this time we're testing with
assassin's creed Odyssey this merit was
7% fast in the GTX 1070 Ti and just 10%
slower than the 2070
should note that I was also 17 percent
faster than Vega 56 as well performance
in hitman 2 will likely be improved
there were a few titles where frame time
performance was down for the r-tx 2016
where you would expect it to be I don't
believe this is a VRAM capacity issue
either so it will likely get solved with
a driver update we did see the odds
study here and there when testing with
the 2060 and this led to a 7% drop-off
for the 1% low result when compared to
the gtx 1070 TI frame time performance
was also down 13% we compared to vega 56
so again I expect performance here to be
addressed with a future drive version
Rainbow six siege is a very complex post
FX heavy title and it seems as though
cheering's concurrent FP 32 and 32
execution is providing a handy
performance boost the Archie ex 2060 for
example was 15% faster than the GTX 1080
which is an impressive increase it was
also 25% faster than the 1070 Ti and
that's a GPU that it is typically
matched or slightly beaten in most of
the titles that we've looked at so far
it was also just 10% slower than the
2070 so a great result for the 2060 in
this title now the last game that we're
going to discuss the results for is
World of Tanks and here we see the RT X
2060 able to match Vega 64 liquid as
well as the gtx 1070 TI this minute was
13% slower than the 2070 but 15% faster
than vega 56 before moving on we'll
quickly look at power consumption the RT
X 2060 looks to only consume slightly
less power than the 2070 placing it
roughly on par with the GTX 1080
of course this means it was able to
reduce total system consumption by
around 20% when compared to Vega 56 but
that's hardly surprising given what we
already know overall power efficiency
hasn't really changed much since Pascal
okay so it appeared like the art seok's
2060 held its own really well against
the more expensive 2070 it was rare to
see it much more than 10% slower it also
seemed as though it was more often than
not fast in the gtx 1070 TI and
therefore faster than vega 56 by a
comfortable margin all that said let's
take a closer look at how the 2060
stacked up to the competition across the
36 games tested when compared
head-to-head
the r-tx 2070 we see at the 2060 was up
to 16 percent slower and that's a pretty
impressive worst-case scenario meanwhile
there were a handful of titles with the
margin was well under 10 percent and
overall this meant the 2060 was an
average just 11 percent slower at 1440p
you have to wonder why anyone would now
spend over 40 percent more on a graphics
card that's not even 15 percent faster
then when we compare the 2060 to the gtx
1070 TI we see that on average it was 4%
faster and there were just half a dozen
instances where the 2060 was slower by a
4% or greater margin so far the only
tiles to really hand the Turing GPUs a
massive advantage over Pascal is Rainbow
six siege but this will be something to
keep an eye on with future game releases
for the most part the RT X 2060 was
superior to Vega 56 in terms of
performance and there was just a single
title where it lost by in excess of a
10% margin and while that title was
Forza horizon 4 meanwhile there were 15
titles where the 2060 was faster by a
10% margin or greater the last
comparison I'm gonna make is with the
GTX 1060 a GPU the 2060 definitely isn't
replacing despite the naming when
compared to the GTX 1060 the r-tx 2060
was on average 53% faster which is a
very nice performance boost that said
when you acknowledge the 40% increase in
MSRP it becomes a lot less impressive
and we'll talk more about that in a
moment for now let's check out the cost
per frame figures okay so here we see
the ITX 2060 came out at a cost of four
dollars and six cents per frame based on
these three hundred and fifty dollar
MSRP that gives it a slightly better
price to performance ratio and the gtx
1070 vega 56 and the RX 590 it also
makes it around 22% more cost-effective
in the RT x 2070 so obviously a step in
the right direction there that said bang
for your buck it's nowhere near as good
as the GTX 1060 which is nowhere near as
good as the rx 580 granted we've always
paid a bit of a premium for the higher
end stuff but generally that premium
only really kicked in right at the
extreme high end these days it seems
anything above the sort of entry-level
stuff will cost you an arm and a leg as
it stands the r-tx 2060
that question the best value mid-range
graphics card hands on right now at $350
it basically eliminates the $500 2070
which was just 11% faster on average and
at most up to 16% faster so do I
recommend the GRT ex 2060 well yeah
there's nothing better at this price
point unless you can get Vega 56 for
$300 or less I wouldn't bother with that
it's slightly slower it consumes loads
more power and there are limited aib
models available and generally it's
really only the crappy reference cards
that seem to go on sale okay so now that
we got that out of the way I should
probably dig into why anything mid-range
or better I will set you back more than
it has before and I'd say there are
multiple reasons for why this is and
NVIDIA being greedy buggers is just part
of the equation and even then there are
multiple reasons as to why they're able
to be such greedy little buggers I'm not
trying to justify prices but there are a
few factors worth considering today's
GPUs more complex and there were a few
years ago I have manufacturing costs
increased we know that the cost to build
a modern fab is astronomical and yields
for these complex all these big GPUs
aren't that great also is more
investment being made into research and
development I think the answer to that
one is unquestionably yes having said
all that a big reason for why chewing is
such a massive and complex GPU is
because a ray tracing a rendering
technology supported by the inclusion of
dedicated hardware known as T cause
these technologies basically being
crammed down the throats of gamers and
as far as I can tell nobody really wants
it at least in its current form and
that's the real problem
the current hardware implementation
really isn't good enough to be of any
real benefit
speaking of ray tracing Tim will test
ray tracing performance with the RT X
2060 soon basically that needs to be a
separate video as there will be a lot of
stuff to cover and not a lot of games of
course but plenty of performance and
visual stuff to go over anyway I believe
gamers would be magnitudes more
accepting of the GeForce 20 series if it
never had any RT course either removing
them entirely to reduce the silicon size
and therefore
or replacing them with more crude a
cause for greater performance in all the
games just tested either would lead to
gamers receiving far more bang for their
buck unfortunately though that's not the
situation we find ourselves in at least
for now it seems like the GeForce 11
series will do away with the RT course
but that's yet to be seen at the extreme
high end we have the NVIDIA Titan RT X
an absurd two and a half thousand dollar
graphics card that packs just 6% more
cause than the already grossly
overpriced RC X xx atti
sure it has twice the GDD r6 memory with
24 gigabytes but good luck putting that
to use meanwhile the RT X xx atti which
is meant to cost $1000 for LOB models is
more like $1200 at best and typically
you can expect to pay $1,300 u.s. and
even if we were getting at the $1000
MSRP I'm pretty sure a lot of people
still wouldn't be happy with that we
were expecting that product to come in
at around $700 and I think if there was
competition from AMD plus a few other
things that we will discuss then I think
that would have been possible anyway
moving on we ended up with the RT X 2084
$700 basically it's a step in for the
GTX 1080i offering basically the same
performance at the same price so
probably wasn't worth the 18-month
weight then we've got the RT X 2070 it's
about 5 to 10% fast and the GTX 1084 the
same price so that's something but 28
months later it's not a whole lot of
something now we have the RT X 2060 it's
slightly cheaper than the MSRP of the
GTX 1070 and offers around 5 to 10
percent more performance so that's
slightly better than what we got with
the 2070 but again after more than two
years it's not exactly amazing progress
either so there are really two ways you
can look at this we can judge the RT X
2060 based on what you historically
expect after two years of development or
we can judge it based on current market
conditions after two years you'd expect
at least a 30% boost in performance for
the same money so the RT X 2060 which is
really a gtx 1070 replacement should be
providing the kind of performance we're
seeing from the RT x 2080 for $700 the
problem with that being that to you when
i
silicon is 72% larger than the GP 104
silicon use by the gtx 1070 1070 TI and
1080 yet you're only getting a 15%
increase in Korea cause of course the
crude of course are much improved but
even so that's only resulted in a
performance boost of about 30% on
average when comparing the r-tx 2080 to
the GTX 1080 the other way to look at
this is that it's a result of current
market conditions gamers have already
proven time and time again they're
willing to pay far too much for a gaming
graphics card and I laugh every time
it's us the reviewers that are blame for
how things have panned out apparently
it's all on us these high graphics card
prices we didn't do enough to keep
Nvidia in line like we have that kind of
power sure having more educated buyers
is a good thing but how many gamers
actually read tech sites and watch tech
channels on YouTube I'm guessing it's
not the majority I could be wrong about
that but I would have thought it was a
pretty safe bet that yeah it would be
the minority of gamers I'm not saying
that there are any media outlets that
didn't gush over what the RT X xx series
has to offer but that's not the reason
why we have RT X xx atti cards selling
for $1200 plus and it's certainly not
the reason why we have a two and a half
thousand dollar Titan Nvidia seems to
keep raising the bar in a somewhat of an
experiment to see what gamers will pay
and I suspect that they are near the
limit with the Titan RT X or at least oh
I hope they're near the limit as a
ridiculous as things have gotten by the
way how many reviewers said the Pascal
Titan X was worth buying as well as the
Titan XP we repeatedly mocked the value
of those products and we even went as
far to say that would be embarrassed to
admit if we'd purchased one of those
graphics cards so it's not really about
showing off at least in our view it's
it's more embarrassing than showing off
I guess is what I'm trying to say then
we have the competition the competition
that's historically helped to drive
pricing down well Vega 64 graphics cards
are scarcely available and have been
pretty much ever since released there's
just a handful of AIB models and
most are very expensive at the time of
making this video new egg had just a
single a sous model selling for four
hundred and six dollars though there
were two reference design models for
$400 but those are pretty horrible if
I'm honest then we have models from MSI
gigabyte and Sapphire all priced upwards
of $550 so more than that of the base
model RTX 20 70s so for all these
reasons and more we're looking at best
at around a 10% improvement in
performance at the same MSRP with no
improvement in efficiency given what we
saw from the r-tx 2080 in 2017 I was
expecting the eventual 2060 part to come
in at around 350 to 400 dollars u.s. and
offer performance somewhere between the
1070 and 1070 TI ultimately making it a
pointless product and just a
continuation of what we already had the
reality is a bit better than that though
we're getting performances typically
between the 1070 TI and 1080 with
pricing that's slightly better than that
of the 10 70s MSRP so for an RT X
graphics card that's actually a pretty
massive win it also makes the RT X 2060
the best value mid-range offering
beating out Vega 56 and all other Pascal
cards priced over $300 us of course if
you're already own a Vega 56 or gtx 1070
graphics card then the upgrade to the
2060 simply won't be worth it likewise
if you have a flagship maxwell GPU so
the gtx 980ti
the upgrade also just isn't worth it but
then that was a six hundred and fifty
dollar graphics card so the fact that
the RT X 2060 is faster I suppose is
impressive I guess and just finally all
the opinions expressed in this video
we're all entirely based on facts and
figures so if you don't like the current
market situation then don't buy any of
these overpriced graphics cards getting
our X 570 and hope that everyone else
does the same and on that note I am
going to be running for cover
