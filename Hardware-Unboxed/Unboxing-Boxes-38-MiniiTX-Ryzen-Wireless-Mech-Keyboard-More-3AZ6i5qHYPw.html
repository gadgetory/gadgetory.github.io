another episode of unboxing boxes you
know it's been probably over a week now
since I did one of these episodes and
you guys have been letting me know about
it my inbox has been getting filled up
the last few days I thought alright I'm
gonna have to do an unboxing boxers I
have been busy with upgrade my PC please
but you guys don't seem to care about
that it's all about the unboxing boxes
apparently so I've scrounge together a
couple of packages here it looks like
we've got about what's that seven three
six six I can count six there's not a
hot sort of had seven anyway we've got
six by the looks of it so suppose I
should open one we'll start with problem
we have a big light one here j-bird I
don't know if they've released anything
you have a look Oh blimey where is my
knife Oh found it
alright box number one coming up here we
go
one of the guards what yeah what's up
we've got a mostly empty box oh nice
okay well that was a big box for a
little product this is a very awesome
little product this the G 903 chaos
spectrum maybe something like that
doesn't does it say on the box no but I
think it might be the chaos spectrum I
will check that out and find out
Logitech have the coolest product names
I have to say alright so for those of
you who don't know this is the newish
it's like a revision of the gr the g 900
sorry so I think the G 900 came out last
year I've been using mine for
have to be a year now and yo I love it
so I've got the G 900 this is the 903
903 and yeah very similar looking Mouse
but there are a few changes big problem
with this Mouse right now is that it's a
hundred and forty dollars u.s. and the
previous version was 115 dollars u.s. so
it's about a twenty percent markup in
price for people in the US so 20 percent
price hike that's not too bad here in
Australia you pay I believe it is about
a hundred and fifty five for the GE 900
that I'm using this 250 to nearly a
hundred dollars more like a 61 percent
increase that's three times the price
premium that the guys in the u.s. face
terrific yours I can't see it being
worth it for that price one hundred and
fifty would be pretty hard to justify
but it is an amazing Mouse and it is
pretty much one of my favorites I'd I'd
probably get it 450 250
I think I'd find a new favorite Mouse
anyway looking past the price which
hopefully will come down all the major
retails in Australia are selling it for
250 there's no price gouging or anything
going on that's obviously the price they
can sell them for once
Australian taxes and whatever it's it a
direct conversion from us it should be
like a hundred and seventy hundred
eighty dollars of course we have
shipping and taxes and things that boost
the price upper 250 seems a bit high but
yeah there's a number of retailers
selling it for that price so I don't
think they've all got together and done
some sort of price fixing it seems
highly unlikely that's just the price
they're selling for at the moment so
hopefully Logitech can offer them in
Australia at a much more competitive and
reasonable realistic price anyway what's
new about this so it has a 10 gram
removable weight adds a little bit of
extra weight if you want to the mouse
it's yeah whatever it's a fairly weighty
Mouse has you know to begin with because
you've got a lift on iron battery in
there and it's a wireless mouse so yeah
whatever it now has a better clicker
rating the old clickers they do 50
million clicks now a 50 million lifespan
previously it was 20 million so you just
left a guy bit been honest
get through that but now 50 yeah
something else will probably fail before
the clickers die hopefully or well I
don't know if you want to fail alright
forget I said no moving on the kid main
key feature is power play believe it's
called power play and it is their new
wireless charging technology so this
mouse supports at the G 900 doesn't what
that means is if you have a power play
capable mouse pad apparently I believe
there's only one wireless charging pad
from Logitech at the moment you have
this mouse on it it won't go flat you
won't have to plug the cable and it will
charge up wirelessly when it needs to
charge up generally that is a big
problem with this mouse it only lasts
about a day of use so I found you know
every day I had to plug it in or at
least every other day because I do set
my computer quite a bit as you probably
you can imagine not a huge problem I
have the cord just sitting there for
goes flat I quickly chuck it in I make
sure if I'm gonna play any games or
anything it is fully charged up you've
got indicators there and the software
tells you what percentage is that so
that's very good and it does charge very
quickly it's fast charging so you plug
it in before you know it things fully
charged you can rip the cable out and be
free again
but yeah having a wireless charging pad
that would just take this thing next
level
the only problem with that is after us
poor Aziz paid $250 for this mouse we
don't have to turn around and pay $200
for the wireless charging pad so yeah
nearly $500 combo that for what is a
really nice gaming mouse but not that
nice so yeah I don't really know what
else to say about that hopefully both
the pad and a mouse become significantly
cheaper in the near future but I
wouldn't hold your breath so is there
anything else in here worth discussing
you obviously have the cable that's a
nice braided cable and it's quite unique
in the way that it clips in it clips in
quite easily and holds in really well
you've got a really yank it out so that
works well looks good
the only problem I've found with these
bits my phone my new phones are type-c
connector anyway so this is well you
could use the adapter so actually that
might solve that problem I was going to
say the problem with this what is that
the microUSB connector is that on my old
Samsung Galaxy Note 4 you kind of had to
like bend of these out of the way
put it in to charge it so you couldn't
use one cable to charge your phone and
your mouse or you could just change to a
normal cable which would still work with
this but anyway whatever not a huge
issue not the end of the world then in
this all container here you have your
you can change the the buttons on the
side here to a single button or jewel
buttons you can also put clicking
buttons in the opposite side there's
just a blank there or you can blank out
both sides and then you have your little
USB dongle and that can also I believe
go in the end of this if you wanted to
for some reason do that but then you
couldn't use that to charge it so anyway
it's got our little micro USB 2 standard
sized USB adapter so but I just plug
that straight into the computer and it
works fine and my computer is quite far
away here's your weight your 10 gram
weight if you want a bit bit of weight I
said did I say I don't know I might have
said I was thinking of saying it feels
the same weight as the mouse I already
have if I said that that's because it
probably is you have to put the weight
in first Steve and if I didn't say that
I was thinking it so the weight just
does it go in there yeah this is one of
those situations where I'm gonna look
like an idiot isn't it and I should just
read the instruction manual I'll be back
in one moment did it do okay no I was on
the right path but you put it in this
first so it just clips into this little
magnetic holder thing in there and then
you line up little line drops in like
that easy and wow it is noticeably
heavier now it is around 10 grams
heavier I would say at a do yeah anyway
so there you go rather expensive Mouse
but I'm very keen to use it as my daily
driver obviously I've got it for free so
yeah whether I would pay 250 for it
I think 150 and yeah it's an amazing
Mouse for that price but 250 yeah that's
a bit bit too much alright enough about
a mouse oh these are a better set of
instructions the old Quick Start manual
God alright up next let's get this one
on the end out of the way this is ain't
a ridiculously light box feels uh like
there's less free space in this one
though well no clues yet as to what is
in this
say hello to convenience $30 what is
this
hello fresh calm today you $30 off
varchar I got two of those okay I have
no idea what that's about I'll try and
work that out later
okay so we have a silver stone HDMI
cable sent from Silverstone and I not
sure what these little gifts are all
about well that could be cool I don't
know but anyway this is the focus of
that box I believe the silver stone
premium certified hdmi 2.0 B cable 4k
ready CP h01 and I believe the 1800
probably means it's 1.8 meters long oops
just butchered the box that shouldn't
matter though we don't need that anymore
alright so have a very very thick very
very premium looking HDMI cable here now
I am by no means an expert on hdmi
cables or even just cables in general so
I'm normally I would say avoid paying a
stupid amount of money for a HDMI cable
they general generally they generally
work or they don't
so yeah paying a heap of money for a
premium cable usually won't improve
anything I know if you're traveling
quite a long distance I'm not sure maybe
10 metres or more then you will need a
good quality cable otherwise you will
just get dropouts and things like that
so what is so good about this
silverstone cable have the fact that it
looks and feels awesome the good news
about this cable is it isn't hideously
expensive it's actually quite reasonable
especially if you used to buying cables
from retailers I know here we have you
know your Harvey Norman's and you good
guys all those kind of guys and a basic
like as basic as they get HDMI cable
they're like $30 so this thing you can
buy online believe it's $14 u.s. from
Amazon or it's like $19 Australian and
our local retailers or the computer
stores that are stocking them so $19 for
this seems very very reasonable so it is
a HDMI 2.0 B cable it's backwards
compatible it will support the 4k
resolution at 60 Hertz so you know
that's about as good as it gets right
now and it does support a bandwidth of
up to 18 gigabits per second so at the
ends here either M we both obviously
have two male connectors here it has a
silver silver aluminium textured sort of
cover here which feels and looks good
it's definitely very strong you're not
going to break that and it's gold-plated
24 karat gold plated connectors so you
should get a nice clear signal through
those and the cable is heavily shielded
which is also very important when you're
running at near power cords and things
like that behind either your computer or
your entertainment you know whatever you
may have and it is 30 AWG or american
wire gauge wiring and that's all sleeved
so yeah it's got a nylon sleeve it's
braided cable that's extremely thick
there's simply no way you're gonna
stretch or break that or yeah it's it's
gonna be very very durable so and as it
says as I suspected on the box it is 1.8
meters long so if you're after a premium
HDMI cable I'd say this is probably the
way to go I don't think it'd be anything
price to this well with this kind of
quality of course I will test it out and
see how it goes but yeah I don't really
have the tools or expertise to really
tell you if it's worth you know spying
this 419 Australian dollars over maybe a
$10 cable but as far as durability and
things go like that and it does look
good not that you really see your HDMI
cable or look at it but anyway a good
quality HDMI cable nonetheless it's
certainly build quality is very good
so hmm check it out all right so so far
we have seen a mouse and a HDMI cable so
it's a little bit different to the usual
GT X 1080 tires and X 399 motherboards
and stuff like that nice change of pace
what do we got here so those two kind of
look like they go together and this is
actually something from asrock so it's
either a new mini PC or a mini
motherboard let's go find out
ah
if you guessed mini PC you were wrong
because it is a very meaning motherboard
that cute little box so what have we got
here we have the as rock fatality a be
350 gaming ITX / AC obviously has AC
Wi-Fi this is actually the first mini
ITX rise and motherboard a.m. for
motherboard I've got my hands on when
trying to get one for ages it's quite
funny because as Rach said they're
sending this out and that was about a
week ago now and at the same time from
PC Kacie I ordered my age 12 900 I
thought this will be the ultimate
pairing and awesome pairing this is
about it's about 125 US and that's about
a ha might be $200 Australian actually
so it is a little bit pricey but still
the a12 900 about 150 Australian 110 US
so similar price APU and motherboard so
I thought that's a pretty cool combo if
you can put that in a tiny little case
you won't need a graphics card or
anything like that Chuck some a gig of
memory on there and that could be a cool
little home theater PC slash gaming rig
that you could play things like rocket
League and possibly overwatch on yeah
that would be a cool combat I was pretty
excited to do a build on that and show
you guys then I got my a 12 not hurry
last week and because hundreds of you
were begging me to I tested out I tested
it before this arrived which I'm
actually glad I did near because I was
going to do a build and then a benchmark
video and that would have yeah would
have made the build video kind of suck
because as it turns out the a 12 know
heard is utter trash
just terrible cpu and I can't really
think of any scenario worth buying it
and you would be livid if you bought
this then put that CPU on it and got a
slim case without the ability to install
a degree of discrete graphics card
because you have that would suck big
time basically your best option here is
to get a rise in 3 1200 overclock it and
then stick something like a gtx 1050 on
there and that is going to be a really
sweet combo that'll play all the latest
games at reasonable settings and be
enjoyable the a12 evenly put the athlon
x4 950 on there it's just a stuttering
mouse guys it's so bad I know there's a
couple of guys a lot you missed the
point it's for this it's for that the
CPU side of things I cannot stress how
bad it is I might even do a video
because it's just that bad over watch
lowest possible quality settings you can
put any discrete GPU you want in there
and it just it's so unplayable it's bad
so yeah
AMD's bristol ridge AP use and their
excavator piledriver bulldozer
architecture it's just no good for
modern gaming and things CPU demanding
games you'll play rocket League and all
that no dramas but battlefield one and
overwatch games like that no good so
anyway I've ranted enough about that
let's have a look at this board as I
said the cheapest lowest end processor
you and I want to stick on here is the
rise of three 1200 and that's a really
good value CPU overclock that 2 4
gigahertz or even 3.8 or whatever you
can get to you definitely do three point
eight three point nine probably four
gigahertz possibly and yeah that is
going to be a sweet game here we go I'm
probably gonna put the Rison 3 1200 on
this overclock at as high as I can
probably go with GG x 1050 Ti maybe I'm
gonna do a build very soon with this
really excited to do that I've been
waiting to do it for a long time anyway
this board is quite feature packed for
the what did I say it was 125 US dollars
for that you get Intel gigabit
networking you get a decent audio
solution using the ALC 1220 codec and
that has codec and that has the creative
cinema 3 audio software supporting it
you got the full so it is a be 350
boards to get the four sada 60 GB per
second ports there's a USB three had a
couple of USB three is on the back
there's a Type C 3.1 this is pretty cool
actually it has an Intel 802 11 AC Wi-Fi
adapter dual antenna deal but it also
has one of them will be bluetooth so
it's got bluetooth 4.2 so that's very
nice indeed so you get all that packed
into this tiny little board and then
hidden around at the back II which I
just spotted a moment ago you have an
ultra I actually may not be an ultra but
I think it's probably an ultra ultra m2
port you have an MDOT to port anyway so
you can put you know Samsung 960 Pro in
there and it's going to be blazing fast
so that's very cool very small vrm
heatsink so I'm not sure how well that
will work but we'll do some temperature
testing and stuff like that and then
there's a little heat sink which will be
on the be 350 chipset I would say yeah
very good
cute little motherboard dual HDMI
outputs it looks like it has pretty much
everything you're gonna want or need and
it's reasonably priced so 125 dollars
u.s. so that's pretty good I'm not sure
how many I know gigabyte has a be 350
board biostar got theirs out first but
uh close but anyway yeah so cool board
neat little IR panel asada antenna so
you've got pair of two SATA cables your
antenna and that's about it in the
package of the battle you really expect
so I'm gonna probably try get my hands
on a cool case mini ITX case put that
build together real soon have a bit of
fun with that and see what we can come
up with but ya expect to see this board
on the channel and a build very soon
alright another Logitech box the last
box
was I think it said j-bird on it but
that's because and I'm not
communications I'm not actually saying
because I'm trying to think what to say
Communications they've represent jaybird
Logitech and probably a heap of other
companies but j-bert and Logitech the
main ones I deal with
so yeah we've got a logitech package
here and I think you guys would agree
it's it's keyboard shaped and the
logitech did release a new and exciting
keyboard and I was kind of hinting at
getting one so let's hope that's what it
is because this could be actually it
could work out really good timing
because I'm going to use that mouse that
I just opened as my daily driver I'll be
using that later today probably to edit
this video and if this is what I think
it is this could be my new keyboard
looking like - could be Steve that's me
okay so this is the new g6 13 keyboard
and very slim package this one it is a
mechanical keyboard and that isn't
particularly unusual most of the
keyboards we look at these days are
mechanical I certainly wouldn't use I
wouldn't go back to a membrane keyboard
or anything like that I love mechanical
keyboards but what is special about this
one well it is a wireless mechanical
keyboard although I have wires all over
my desk because I have test systems all
around me and you know constantly
plugging in wires and stuff so I can't
do the neat kind of set up walls type
setup should see but I like to have my
main rig in between all the chaos quite
neat and tidy that's why I like the
wireless mouse I don't have to have that
cord there that often or at least all
the time and I have a really really
thick USB cable going to my keyboard and
I thought it'd be nice to get rid of
that and so when I saw this I thought
this is a solution to get rid of that
Wow
looks very cool on the back I love okay
already I like the way the palm rest is
completely integrated it's not even
detachable which I don't really have a
problem with because I never detach mine
and the detachable ones often flop
around a bit fall off when you move them
so I'm happy that that's physically
attached
all times I don't have a problem with
that that I can think of right off the
bat I'll let you know after I use it for
a bit so it does have the aroma GK's
which I have to admit not a huge fan of
use them a bit in the past and these
actually I don't know if they've
modified them or change them but these
feel a little more tactile than the last
time I remember using them it's possible
I haven't changed all I'm not sure I
still just called the Roma G switches so
yeah dono better for some reason I feel
I remember them being much more mushy
err maybe it's just me I don't know but
these are these feel pretty good so on
the back here the feet they sort of
pivoted up on a nice angle there is only
one setting it is quite high quite
aggressive but I like the higher angle
you've got rubber pads the whole way
along the front here and then rubber
pads on the feet so when placed on the
desk you know it grips quite well it
doesn't move around easily so that's
good but you can move it back and forth
because there's the legs fold out
sideways rather than back or forward
when you move it around on the desk they
don't fold away so that's good news
today I sold out words very good we've
got some dedicated multimedia keys
volume up down play Paul's next all that
sort of stuff there is a Wi-Fi button by
the looks of it you can connect it using
Wireless with a dongle or you can
connect it a viable ooh - I just get
into this little accessories package and
see what we can find that's kind of neat
so if you use this again I'm just
guessing here this is like a standoff
you use it at your home theater PC or
whatever you can just sit it on the
stand when you're not using it and it
just sits like that on your coffee table
or whatever could be wrong just winging
it as I do anyway that down to some
serious business the cool things about
this wireless mechanical keyboard I
didn't believe this when I read it at
first but it takes just two double-a
batteries and that in itself isn't that
amazing
but with just two double-a batteries and
they're not special rechargeable ones or
anything like that just to standard
double-a batteries
it'll last eight
ten months so that's awesome obviously
it's not RGB backlit and all that
because that would chew three about
trees in hours but yeah that's
incredible so I assume that's reasonable
amount of usage each day 18 months so I
mean even half that time is pretty
awesome for a pair of double-a batteries
in a wireless keyboard so yeah I think
this will end up on my desk later today
as my daily driver and you won't run out
of batteries either a battery power
because at 15% and when there's only 15%
of power left in the batteries these
software will pop up notifying you of
that and apparently there are two LED
lights I believe probably the caps lock
and battery light they both flash on to
indicate that the battery is indeed
going flat and you will need to swap
those puppies out so now you just go in
and look at that it's come with two
pre-installed and there is your USB
little dongle so that's probably a
wireless dongle wouldn't be bluetooth
but don't quote me on that I have no
idea
as usual I don't know if I'm actually
showing you guys I'll throw up some
b-roll of it I don't think this like I
said I think there's any lights or
anything like that so this is pretty
much how it looks when it's not being
used and when it's being used but when
it's being used they'll be like hands
doing stuff you get the idea there is
also what have we got here six six
programmable G keys so you can obviously
program them to whatever you want using
the Logitech software and so we've got
the multi media buttons up here and
there they're nice and clicky and the
cool thing about the Bluetooth button
that'll one you can actually connect to
this via bluetooth to eight devices
simultaneously so you can have a you
know one profile for your phone if you
wanted to use it for that to type
messages and things or do emails when
you're at home with it
your TV your other personal computer or
whatever I can tablet whatever you've
got up to eight devices this can be you
can have a profile for all that devices
and connect to so that's very cool
indeed and for a wireless keyboard it's
not ridiculously heavy either it's about
of
thousand or one thousand four hundred
and ten grams to be precise about 1.4
kilos and that's pretty easy pretty easy
to pick up and move around and the feet
look pretty solid and anything you'll
break them off to is it looks like
they'd probably pop out under pressure
with em folded away on say it's quite
durable it would survive a drop or two
and it does have a two-year warranty as
well if you drop it and smash it I'd say
you aren't you won't cover that but you
know usual failures and things like that
it will cover all right so I'll plug
that in later on today I will use it
while I'm editing this video and I
hopefully if I like it I'll be using it
for the forseeable I'll let you guys
know what I think all righty we have two
we have the garbage bags left so we're
finishing on the garbage bags for this
one oh bugger anyone see where I put
that knife it's all right got it I'll
edit that struggle out okay
let's start with the big one shall we
okay I've messed up this episode I've
done two keyboards and our three
keyboards in a row what we have in here
it looks like well I assume I'm pretty
certain these are keyboards that one
says green just say green when I say
thatif I said green switches Cherry MX
anyway Cherry MX so that's most likely a
keyboard and this also says mechanical
tactile on the package so looks like we
have two keyboards on our hands so this
one is the a k60 and well this one is
the ak-47 ak-47 on the box so these are
ages ages yeah ages keyboards and these
have been provided by the retailer
banggood so if you guys are interested
in these I'll provide them banggood sent
some stuff I think for the last episode
or maybe it was one before
maybe they sell some pretty cool gear
and it's at very reasonable prices so
let's have a look at the ak-47 so the
ak-47 comes with for this particular
model I have I think maybe they all do
is Cherry MX green so it is genuine
Cherry MX switches and these are the
green variant which aren't that easy to
come across I don't believe so this is
160 dollar u.s. keyboard it is a premium
keyboard take a look at it and that
works out to be for those buying from
the banggood website in Australia it is
205 dollars Aussie I believe put the Box
aside we'll get this foam off that's a
bit fancy looking okay so it's red on
the back I suppose the cables red and
black has lots of red black braided
cable kind of a big huge USB interesting
looking connector on it okay so it has a
pair of feet for two different height
adjusts so that's kind of cool
pretty standard stuff not really a rest
rest rest rest rest yeah there there
wrist rests aren't they got a very small
kind of like it's a brushed kind of
aluminium and he's it is actually our
minion
on the front of it and that looks and
feels nice but I would have liked
something a bit bigger for 160 dollar
u.s. price tag and then you've got the
little aluminium instead up here and
there's some lights there which will
indicate things like num lock caps lock
and all that usual keyboardist stuff so
yeah this this green switch is a darker
than I thought they'd be I'm probably
used to seeing the green razor switches
which are a bit different because
they're not Cherry MX switches but
anyway say green
Cherry MX switches they all sound very
much the same they all feel very similar
they've got a really nice feel to them I
have to say I think it's 80 gram
actuation force on these and I think
they have a 2 millimeter travel distance
till actuation and a four millimeter
travel distance to the bottom so yeah
that's that feat that feels right I'll
have to throw up some b-roll cuz I've
got nothing to plug it into at the
moment that thing doesn't work when I
plug stuff in need to be in windows and
all that sort of stuff I believe it's
got brain backlit switches so that the
switches themselves a green backlit I
believe the LEDs here are green they are
of course actually green switches but
they are also green backlit so that's an
interesting choice I would have thought
you'd make the cable of black and green
and this potentially green but anyway I
mean from the front I suppose it'll be
black and green it would look pretty
cool just yeah bit of a clash there with
the plastic I think I think I can almost
guess the comments and that I'm guessing
many of you guys wish the cable was
solid black and if that's true I kind of
see where you're coming from I wish the
same and if it was black on the back I
think it was black on the back with the
black cable and this was black and
either green or white LED backlighting I
think then this would be a really really
sweet looking keyboard but as it stands
it is a cool keyboard anyway
definitely feels very premium looks very
premium extremely stiff and strong
I'll give it a go and yeah I will have
already you will have already seen how
it looks lit up and whatever with the
b-roll so hopefully that looked pretty
cool
come on there because I haven't seen it
yeah it's also quite weighty I think Oh
have I talked about the weight yet no
that was the other keyboard this is one
or one thousand three hundred and fifty
grams so that 1.3 kilos so it's a bit
lighter than the the wireless keyboard
we just looked at and you can see this
key the wireless keyboard is much even
off that's in the frame much larger
because it has that non-detachable wrist
rest and I wish this came with a wrist
rest but unless it is a just add water
wrist rest I can't see it anyway cool
keyboard and I'll give that a test out
on one of the test systems see how it
goes all right we have another a jazz
keyboard and this one is the a K 60 so
we are we're going up a level with this
one potentially doesn't look like it
based on the packaging I think a 45 is
the big boss I'll hang on hang on a
minute maybe this we have packaging
within packaging packaging Paki diary
about it I've opened up the box this one
we have a key puller with its own
packaging good job Steve wowzers that is
that is probably the most impressive key
cap pull-up thing I've ever seen it's
even got a blue switch on the top of the
clear key cap wow that's that's next
level on the key kept pulling front no
wrist rest on this one either so but we
do have an all black oh wow this is like
a dare I say it a desk knock off kind of
looking keyboard now all black kind of a
gunmetal gray on the top and I believe
that that is an aluminium top plate so
another premium keyboard this one this
though doesn't
Cherry MX switches they are knockoff I
think blues your knockoff blues I
believe don't think they're Cherry MX
isn't based on the price I'd be
surprised if they are because this is
actually quite affordable for what it is
a hundred dollars us for this model and
that works out to be one hundred and
thirty dollars for those that purchase
it from Bangladesh under dollars u.s.
there's plenty of mechanical keyboards
for that price but this one looks quite
nice I have to say it is very
interesting if you look at it from the
top what is missing from this picture
what is unusual about this keyboard well
of course it is the key caps and you can
see they are labeled yep they're labeled
along the the I suppose the front face
not the top face depend on what a front
of a key is and say this is the top
anyway they are along there so if you
sit at your desk there with me this
chair go down and that's as low as it
goes so if you if you sit your desk like
this these are perfect I can see what
the keys are if you of course sit at the
desk like a regular person like like
this you don't know what they are so
yeah that's a it's a really good
keyboard for that for the hunched folks
now fix my chair now had this perfectly
set where's the lever
mother right hot but yeah in all
seriousness it does have side carved key
caps I mean I don't look at my key caps
when I type most people don't I rarely
find myself looking at what a keys
pretty much don't so that's kind of cool
I suppose and it is interestingly though
although the key caps are there it is
RGB backlit so you're going to see the
glow around the key cap the etching here
will light up apparently I'll throw some
b-roll up right now so you guys know
exactly what I'm talking about well I'm
just sitting here winging it yeah so
that's kind of novel interesting
different keen to try that out so it's
your classic 104 key layout but it
actually has a hundred and
because you've got some media keys there
and you've also got this dual action
scroll wheel I believe when the LED
light that apparently is built into it
when that is active you can use it to
adjust the lighting so you can turn the
brightness up and down you can turn the
lighting on and off by clicking the
button and then in normal mode it is
volume control so you can mute I believe
the volume by clicking it and you can
adjust the volume up and down so yeah
dual action wheel that's kind of a cool
volume wheel though I like that looks
good feels good so it's gotta go to not
chee feel so as you turn it some kind of
like a notched mouse wheel kind of feel
to it this particular model is software
controller it does have software support
so there is a nice little utility you
can use to adjust things like lighting
and possibly key mapping and stuff like
that so that's kind of cool a lot of the
sort of unknown brands cheaper brands
don't have a software supports this one
does and yeah so the feet can be set to
the one height there it has so that the
feet the feet kind of hop a bit and want
to follow the way when you push it back
they're not too bad yes so I think I'm
doing this right you push that down
there and it pulls the key off there you
go it caught that one and potentially
doing this wrong I just lost a key
across the room so you just pull them
apart and then it pulls the key off
anyway that works pretty well if you
want to pull the keys off and lose them
and shoot them across the room and
hopefully can find them again
alright keycap returned installed i'm
keen to give this one a go as well so i
have a lot of keyboarding to do now I'll
have to uh write a review or something
and do some actual work we'll look into
that and you a really cool fancy key cap
remover so it's been a little while
since we've done a keyboard edition
there you go three keyboards in one
video that's a lot of keys we also have
the new Logitech mouse this motherboard
which I am particularly excited about
and a very fancy but surprisingly well
priced HDMI cable
yeah like the look at that I'll give it
a go and let you guys know but yeah
it'll work I don't know that much else
to say but it is yeah
nice premium cable it is very thick
suppose is a good thing it's HDMI cable
but oh he's got a view busting my chops
about testing the knock to a thread
Ripper coolers I've got nothing to
report I'm I'm still it's in the work
somewhat also still working on the Auris
water force review as well hopefully get
that out next week or this week I don't
know we'll see how we go I've got a heap
of stuff do I still have a mountain of
boxes that need unboxing and there is a
heat more exciting stuff coming up later
this month and early next month so no
shortage of content guys and of course
we've still got all the upgrade my PC
please episodes to get through so yeah
busy indeed well I hope you enjoyed this
episode of unboxing boxes where we
mostly unboxed keyboards and no 1080 T
eyes or X 399 motherboards or any
new upcoming stuff but yeah the
keyboards were cool gonna use the
Logitech keyboard mouse combo I've a
build with this soon I've got to get a
cool Mini ITX case off someone I think
the guys at PC case key you might have a
cool fan ticks okay so I can use they've
been talking about so maybe we'll do
that I don't know you'll find out in an
upcoming episode of unboxing boxes when
I get the case asking to up this one I
