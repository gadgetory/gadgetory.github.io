today's video we're taking an early look
at how Ubisoft's upcoming Tom Clancy's
Ghost Recon wildlands game plays on the
PC this open-world tactical shooter
offers gamers both single-player and for
player cooperative multiplayer modes as
a tenth installment in the Ghost Recon
franchise wildlands is the first to
offer an open-world environment
Ubisoft says this is one of the biggest
open-world games they've ever created
the game includes a wide variety of
environments such as mountains forests
deserts and salt flats over the weekend
there was a closed beta for the game and
by the sounds of it a huge amount of
players checked it out I myself spent
quite a bit of time playing not just
pinch marking and I have to say it was
quite a bit of fun as you might expect
performance at this point is
questionable but since the game is still
in the beta phase we can't really
criticize the developer too much just
yet anyway
I have to say though the game does look
quite amazing and I did find that
reducing the quality settings ever so
slightly did boost performance quite
substantially what was great to find is
a huge amount of tweakable graphics
options as well as a neat little
built-in benchmark for testing your
systems performance Ubisoft has also
included a very cool preview of what it
is that each setting does so gamers can
better tune their settings this is
something I wish more game developers
did as it is extremely useful since
wildlands does have a built in benchmark
I decided to test using that as well as
a 60 second fraps pass please note that
due to the game is beta status I haven't
tested the usual 20 or so graphics cards
just eight GPUs have been tested and yes
most of them are in video based GPUs I
will invest considerably more time in
testing the game once it has been
officially released and proper driver
support is being offered by AMD and
NVIDIA so for now we have a small sample
of graphics cards to look at and please
take these results with a big old grain
of salt these numbers will very likely
change between now and the official game
release in a month's time for more
information on the drivers used and the
test system specifications please check
the video's description so first up
let's check the results using the built
in benchmark the GeForce GTX 1080 is
good for just 71 FPS at 1080p using the
very high quality preset considering we
see well over 130 FPS on our battlefield
1 test there
are some improvements to be made here of
course this is an open-world game but
even the terribly optimized mafia 3
pushed it around 90 FPS at 1080p with
the GTX 1080
anyway as I've said the game is still in
the beta stage so grab onto that grain
of salt and hold it tight performance
gets pretty ugly with the GTX 1060 which
averaged just 49 fps and then the R X
480 with just 43 fps
interestingly the three gigabyte 1060
takes a massive beating here dropping
down in just 38 fps so I do wonder that
if in the final version of the game the
three gigabyte 1060 will still be over
20% slower than the six gigabyte model
moving to 1440p it's a framerate
bloodbath the GTX 1066 gigabyte card
averaged just 34 fps with regular visits
into the 20s the RX 480 was just a
single frame slower but of course this
isn't the kind of performance 10 60 or
480 owners will be looking for given
what we just saw it 1440p you probably
don't need to see the 4k results but
here they are anyway in all of their
stutter enos the Titan XP is reduced to
console levels of performance here
thankfully though we aren't playing at
900p okay so we've checked out the
built-in benchmark results and the
performance was quite brutal if I'm
honest using the very high quality
preset let's now take a look at actual
gameplay I have found that the most
demanding activity was driving
frameworks around 10 FPS LOL when
compared to just walking or running
around so here is our 60 seconds frappe
pass where i drive around three hairy
and heavily armed ghosts in mum's
minivan when compared to the benchmark
results with Titan XP is now 16 percent
slower dropping down to an average of 67
fps the GTX 1080 is now 20% slower and
the GTX 1060 14% slower
AMD can also be seen taking some pretty
big hits the RX 480 is now 21% slow with
an average frame rate of just 34 fps at
1080p
interestingly to note whereas the RX 4
80 was 12% slower than the GTX 1060 in
the built in benchmark it's now 19%
slower moving to 1440p I found it almost
impossible now to drive the van with
anything less than the GTX 1080 the
Titan XP wasn't too bad but for a
graphics card of his calibre the
performance was less than as
now at 4k even the Titan XP can't
maintain smooth playable performance at
all times and here gamers will be forced
to reduce the quality settings in order
to pick up some extra frames out of
interest I quickly checked out the very
high high and medium quality presets
compared in terms of performance when
using the GeForce GTX 1080 the game is
incredibly well detailed and I know it's
going to cop a heap of abuse for being
unoptimized even though we are just
looking at the beta version what I found
interesting though was even with the
high quality preset in use the image
quality was still excellent and frankly
not really that different to the very
high settings more importantly
performance for the GTX 10 was boosted
by almost 50% and that's obviously huge
even from high to medium the game still
looked quite good and yet we found
another 20% performance anyway that's
all the testing i've done for now and i
actually ended up doing a bit more than
i set out to do some final notes worth
mentioning multi GPU support doesn't
exist yet so sli and crossfire aren't
working but we do expect to see support
for these technologies in the final
version of the game once AMD and NVIDIA
released their drivers the game at this
point doesn't appear to be very CPU
demanding at all which is surprising
that said I am yet to play with a full
team of human controlled players but I
don't expect this to change much for now
the huge range of tweakable image
quality settings is great and that
quality settings preview screen is
amazing the built-in benchmark is also
very welcomed and it gives an excellent
amount of information about the system
hopefully Ubisoft can polished
performance a bit more before next
month's release and of course I do
expect game ready drivers from AMD
Nvidia to make quite a big difference as
well in any case what you can expect
next month is a big in depth benchmark
video from harbour unbox covering all
the previous and current generation GPUs
and if it calls for it I'll do some CPU
testing on the final version as well
well that's a wrap for now please do
take these results what they are they're
just a rough guide and we are hoping to
see much better performance next month
when the games officially released I'm
your host Steve and stay tuned because
we do have some more exciting videos
coming later in the week
