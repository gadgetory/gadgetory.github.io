today's video we're taking an early look
at how Ubisoft upcoming Tom Clancy's
Ghost Recon wildlands game plays on the
pc these open-world tactical shooter
offers gamers both single-player and
four player cooperative multiplayer
modes as a temp installment in the ghost
recon franchise wildlands is the first
to offer an open world environment
Ubisoft except this is one of the best
open-world games they've ever created
the game includes a wide variety of
environments such as mountains forests
deserts and salt flats over the weekend
there was a closed beta for the game and
by the sounds of it a huge amount of
players checked it out I myself spent
quite a bit of time playing not just
pinch marking and I have to say it was
quite a bit of fun as you might expect
performance at this point is
questionable but think the game is still
in the beta phase we can't really
criticize the developer too much just
yet anyway I have to say though the game
does look quite amazing and I did find
that reducing the quality settings ever
so slightly did Bruce performance quite
substantially what was great to find is
a huge amount of tweakable graphics
options as well as a neat little
built-in benchmark for testing your
systems performance Ubisoft has also
included a very cool preview of what it
is that each setting does so a game is
competitor in their settings this is
something I wish more game developers
did as it is extremely useful since
wildlands does have a built-in bench
mark I decided to test using that as
well as a 60-second fraps pass please
note that due to the game is beta status
I haven't tested the usual 20 or so
graphics cards just ate GPUs have been
tested and yes most of them are in video
based GPUs I will invest considerably
more time in testing the game once it
has been officially released and proper
driver support is being offered by AMD
and NVIDIA so for now we have a small
sample of graphics cards to look at and
please take these results with a big old
grain of salt these numbers will very
likely change between now and the
official game release in a month's time
for more information on the drivers used
and the test system specifications
please check the video's description so
first up let's check the results using
the built-in bench marks the GeForce GTX
1080 is good for just 71 SPS at 1080p
using a very high quality preset
considering we see well over a hundred
30 FPS in our battlefield one test
there are some improvements to be made
here of course this is an open-world
game but even the terribly optimized
mafia 3 pushed it around 90 FPS at 1080p
with the GTX 1080 anyway as I said the
game is still in the beta stage so grab
onto that grant assault and hold it
tight performance gets pretty ugly with
the GTX 1060 which averaged just 49 FPS
and then the RX 480 was just 43 FPS
interestingly the three gigabyte 1060
takes a massive beating here dropping
down to just 38 FPS so I do wonder that
if in the final version of the game the
three gigabyte 1060 will still be over
twenty percent slower than the six
gigabyte model moving to 1440p it's a
frame rate bloodbath the GTX 1066
gigabyte card average just 34 FPS with
regular visits into the 20s the RX 480
was just a single frame slower but of
course this isn't the kind of
performance 1060 or 480 owners will be
looking for given what we just saw it
1440p you probably don't need to see the
4k results but here they are anyway in
all of this study arena the Titan XP is
reduced to console level of performance
is thankfully though we aren't playing
at 900p ok so we've checked out the
built-in benchmark results and the
performance was quite brutal if I'm
honest using the very high quality
preset let's now take a look at actual
gameplay I have found that the most
demanding activity was driving
frameworks around 10 FPS LOL when
compared to just walking or running
around so here is our 60 seconds flat
past 40 drive around three Harry and
heavily-armed ghost in mums minivan when
compared to the benchmark results with
Titan XP is now sixteen percent slower
dropping down to an average of 67 FPS
the GTX 1080 is now twenty percent
slower and the GTX 1060 fourteen percent
slower aimed you can also be seen taking
some pretty big hit the RX 480 is now 21
percent slow with an average frame rate
of just 34 SPS eternity p interestingly
to note whereas the RX for a was twelve
percent slow in the gtx 260 and we built
in benchmark it's now nineteen percent
slower moving a 1440p I found it almost
impossible now to drive the van with
anything less than the GTX 1080 but
Titan XP wasn't too bad but for a
graphics card of this caliber the
performance is less than does
horrible now it for okay even the Titan
XP can't maintain smooth playable
performance at all times and here gamers
will be forced to reduce the quality
settings in order to pick up some extra
frames out of interest i quickly checked
out the very high high and medium
quality presets compared in terms of
performance when using the GeForce GTX
1080 the game is incredibly well
detailed and I know it's going to cop a
heap of abuse for being unoptimized even
though we are just looking at the beta
version what I found interesting there
was even with the high quality preset in
use the image quality was still
excellent and frankly not really that
different to the very high settings more
importantly performance for the GTX tiny
was boosted by almost fifty percent and
that's obviously a huge even from hide a
medium the games to look quite good and
yet we found another twenty percent
performance anyway that's all the
testing I've done for now and I actually
ended up doing a bit more than I set out
to do some final notes worth mentioning
multi-gpu support doesn't exist yet so
SLI and crossfire aren't working but we
do expect to see support for these
technologies in the final version of the
game once AMD and NVIDIA released their
drivers the game at this point doesn't
appear to be very CPU demanding at all
which is surprising that's that I am yet
to play with a film team of human
controlled players but I don't expect
this to change much for now the huge
range of tweakable image quality
settings is great and that quality
settings preview screen is amazing the
built-in benchmark is also very welcomed
and it gives an excellent amount of
information about the system hopefully
Ubisoft can polished performance a bit
more before next month's release and of
course I do expect game ready drivers
from AMD Nvidia to make quite a big
difference as well in any case what you
can expect next month is a big in-depth
benchmark video from harbour unbox
covering all the previous and current
generation GPUs and if it calls for it
i'll do some cpu testing on the final
version as well well that's a rat phone
out please do take these results what
they are they're just a rough guide and
we are hoping to see much better
performance next month when the game's
official e released I'm your host Steve
and stay tuned because we do have some
more exciting videos coming later in the
week
