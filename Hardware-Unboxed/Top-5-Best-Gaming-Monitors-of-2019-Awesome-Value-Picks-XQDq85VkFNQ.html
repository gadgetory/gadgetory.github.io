time to talk about the best monitors you
can get on the market right now
normally we do these sorts of updates
every six months or so it turns out I
miss the mark by a couple of months so
I'm a little late with this update but
it's probably best that I've waited
until now to get some more monitor
testing under my belt before the next
wave kicks off later this year the focus
of this video is on gaming monitors if
you're after a professional monitor for
work the requirements are a bit
different so we're just sticking to
gaming for now and as always we're
continuing to look for the best value
picks in each category
sometimes I'll also provide an outright
best option which might blow out the
budget a bit more but as always the
focus is bang for buck value products
but before we get into the pics this
video is brought to you by Vikings war
of clans a pretty addictive game that
you can play on your PC right now you
know us we love PC gaming here at
Hardware unbox which is why we've
partnered with Vikings war of clans for
this video and to be honest it's an
impressive game for something that's so
easy to launch all it takes is a web
browser know download necessary plus
registration is fast and easy so you'll
be playing in no time and just quietly
I'm a big fan of these types of strategy
games they're a lot of fun especially
when you start to link up with other
players online join Vikings for free
using my link in the description box
today and get a cool bonus of 200 gold
coins for a kick start trust me
it's really worth your time now let's
get back to the video
last time I updated my monitor
recommendations the vo-tech GN 24 C was
my pick in the best 1080p category
fast-forward more than half a year and
this excellent value option is still the
best choice for gamers on a budget in
fact it's even come down in price
dropping from $200 at the end of last
year to just a hundred and eighty
dollars these days making it even more
of a steal than usual the vo-tech June
24 C is a 24 inch 1080p 144 Hertz
display that uses a curved VA panel
similar to many other monitors out there
there are a lot of reasons why this is a
great choice for gamers firstly the high
maximum refresh rate delivers smoother
gameplay then slower 75 or 60 Hertz
options given you're only saving $50 at
best to drop down to 75 Hertz it's well
worth spending the extra money on 144
Hertz not only will this monitors better
specs last you longer but many GPUs
these days are highly capable of 1080p
high refresh gaming even in the
mid-range class so making the most out
of these specs isn't as outlandish as it
once was
the GN 24 C also comes with free sync
and it supports low framerate
compensation which effectively allows
adaptive sync to work from 144 Hertz all
the way down to 1 Hertz this is a key
requirement for gaming monitors and
something you won't get with cheaper 75
Hertz monitors plus the June 24 C works
perfectly with either AMD or Nvidia
graphics cards I also really like the
size for 1080p 27 inches is a bit too
large for modern 1080p displays and you
start to feel the effects of a low pixel
density at that size but 24 inches just
feels right and the VA technology helps
to deliver a decent contrast ratio of
over three thousand to one in my testing
response times are also excellent for a
VA with a 5.2 millisecond grader great
average the only major downside to the
GN 24 C is its availability you can only
get this monitor in the United States
but don't worry because basically the
same panel is available in other
territories in the msi m AG 241 c it's a
little more expensive than the June 24 C
in the US but it's still around the $200
mark which makes it a decent alternative
don't confuse it with the older msi g20
4c though try and get the ma g variant
instead it's a little bit better
understandably not everyone once a
curved veer
pants some buyers might want a flat
monitor instead or something with better
response times in that case I'll point
you towards either the Acer XF a 240 or
the AOC g2 560 FX both the 24-inch 144
Hertz 1080p 10 monitors at around $200
the picture quality isn't as good as the
June 24 C but both are good budget
options if you're after something a
little different
1440p monitors remain the best option
for gamers with excellent high refresh
model sitting between 300 and 400 US
dollars it's no longer an outrageous
proposition to have a monitor that
combines a decent resolution with
excellent performance if you have a
mid-range to high-end GPU a 1440p 144
hertz display will give you a great
experience today and still have plenty
of life left for the next few GPU
generations my pick of the bunch right
now is the LG 32 GK 650f at three
hundred and fifty dollars it's not the
outright cheapest model with the 1440p
144 Hertz display you can get 27 inch
curved v8 models for around 300 to 310
dollars without much issue but the 32 GK
650f has a number of additional features
that are worth spending cash on over the
more budget offerings to start with it's
a 32 inch flat VA panel I prefer flat
panels over curved panels especially at
this size and aspect ratio and it seems
many of you guys do as well given that
27 inch curved variant sit around $300
and 32 inch variants at 330 dollars at
their cheapest I think it's well worth
spending an extra thirty dollars to go
up in size from 27 to 32 inches and then
an extra $20 on top of that to make it
flat but that isn't the only reason why
the 32 GK 650f gets my vote it has
class-leading performance for a 144
Xavier panel of these specifications
especially when it comes to response
times which allowed the panel to deliver
a true 144 Hertz experience many of the
curved options sit in the eight to nine
millisecond grader gray range which is
too slow for true 144 Hertz while the 32
GK 650f clocks in at 6.5 milliseconds
that's important for delivering less
ghosting and motion blur it also lacks
wide gamut functionality which might be
a negative to some but it actually makes
the monitor more accurate and easier to
work with given most content your
viewers master for srgb it doesn't
support HDR unlike some which claim to
offer HDR but just are not giving you a
fake experience and perhaps most
importantly it comes with a very
adjustable stand featuring height tilt
swivel and pivot functionality features
that are usually cut with lower end
products if you don't have $350 to spend
my other recommendation is the pixie opx
to
seven 5h and just 260 US dollars it's a
27-inch 1440p 95 Hertz monitor with a
flat IPS panel and 95% DCI p3 coverage
it too has decent response times around
the 6.5 millisecond mark and all the
advantages of an IPS display including
excellent viewing angles and color
performance for $90 less the only real
downside here is the refresh rate which
is cut down to 95 Hertz
it still has free sync and it's still a
great option for gamers who want a
decently high refresh 1440p monitor on a
budget and finally I'd also like to
point out the biotech GFT 27 DB which is
the best 1440 PT and monitor you can get
it costs $300 unlike the 32 GK 650f
offers 1440p at 144 Hertz but in a flat
27 inch size the reason you'd get this
over the LG model is if you were really
concerned about response times the GMT
27 DB is about twice as fast and has
great color performance for a TN but
still features the usual TN issues like
relatively poor viewing angles and
contrast ratios
for ultra-wide monitors there are two
recommended directions you can go either
you can save a bit of cash and opt for a
34 40 by 1440 you display at a hundred
Hertz or you can go all out on the best
144 Hertz models on the market
considering the price difference my
current recommendation is for the
cheaper 100 Hertz morals but I'll
present both of you here so when looking
at 34 40 by 1440 ultra wide displays at
100 Hertz or you'll have to spend these
days is around four hundred and fifty
dollars which is crazy considering just
a few years ago these panels were a
premium $1000 option most of the budget
classed models used the same Samsung VA
panel offering contrast around three
thousand to one and response times in
the five to seven millisecond range it's
a high quality panel that's well suited
to gaming and something I have no
trouble recommending my pick of the
bunch right now goes to the MSI ma g3
for 1cq which is on sale for just three
hundred and ninety dollars but often
sits at four hundred and fifty dollars
or so it's widely available delivers
decent performance and is going to
impress those who haven't doubled in
ultralights before if the ma G 341 C Q
isn't a great price for you those in the
US should look at the vo-tech GN 34 seat
which is very similar at around 450
dollars while Aziz should check out
Cogan's essentially identical 34 inch
ultrawide monitor with the crazy product
name if you have more money to spend and
they're interested in getting the best
available monitor without getting ripped
off entirely I'd go with the LG 34 GK
950 F it's one of the few monitors
offering 30 for 40 by 1440 at 144 Hertz
right now and does so with a curved IPS
panel that's excellent quality out of
the box and offers over 95% DCI p3
coverage for wide gamut work the edge to
our experience isn't great but response
times near 6 milliseconds and adaptive
sync that works with AMD and NVIDIA GPUs
headlines a feature set that's
outstanding for ultra wide gamers you'd
have to really want the additional
refresh rate though because while this
monitor is the best available for gaming
right now it does cost an eye-watering
$1,000 which does drop occasionally to
$800 on sale even that sale price though
is significantly higher than the 100
Hertz model that I typically recommend
the best 4k monitor category is going to
be the shortest because there aren't
many displays in contention right now
for most people especially those on a
tighter budget getting a 1440p 144 Hertz
monitor will be a better option than a
4k 60 hertz display for gaming both
costs roughly the same these days but
the 1440p models I've just been talking
about will have better performance
better adaptive sync experiences higher
refresh rates and often better panel
quality the step up from 1440p to 4k
isn't nearly as large as this step from
say 1080p to 1440p in terms of visual
quality so to me it's simply not worth
trading off all those extras especially
the high refresh rate for just a small
bump in resolution whether there are a
couple of monitors that offer the best
of both worlds a high resolution 4k
experience with a high refresh rate and
the best on the market right now is the
ASA nitro XV 273 K it will set you back
around $800 at least twice the price of
a basic 60 Hertz model but it delivers a
27 inch IPS display at 3840 by 2160 with
the maximum refresh rate of 120 Hertz
and I say 120 Hertz here because despite
being advertised as 144 Hertz the
maximum refresh rate you can use in a
practical setting is 120 Hertz not that
that's a bad thing it's still a high
refresh rate and something you'll
struggle to max out even with an NVIDIA
GeForce r-tx 20 atti
in my testing performance was solid and
it offers a wide color gamut if required
I'd ignore the HDR capabilities though
they're mediocre at best
unfortunately there hasn't been a lot of
improvements made in the hgr monitor
ecosystem since the last time I was
recommending monitors there are still
lots of monitors that claim to be HDR
compatible but don't deliver a great HDR
experience common issues include not
supporting a high peak brightness not
including a full array local dimming
backlight for increased contrast and
occasionally not even supporting wide
color gamut pretty much every monitor
that passes display HDR 400
certification doesn't actually deliver a
meaningfully improved HDR experience and
therefore it isn't worth buying as an
HDR display and it's not much better at
display HDR 600 while only a small
selection of display HDR 1000 monitors
pass all the required terms in the
checklist looking at these validation
badges unfortunately isn't good enough
to determine whether an HDR monitor is
actually going to deliver a good
experience
my advice for most people interested in
HDR monitors is the same as last year
and that's not to bother the risk of
fake HDR is too high it's still too
early to jump into the HDR ecosystem and
I'd hate for anyone to buy an expensive
hgr monitor only to discover later that
they've got something with fake HDR if a
monitor says it supports HDR make sure
it's a good SDR monitor at a good price
first and then treat any HDR support as
a free bonus and don't pay extra for hgr
either I've seen plenty of monitors
where they offer HD are at an added
price but the HDR mode isn't actually
any better than SDR with that said if
you have money to burn and they're after
a real hgr monitor for gaming my
recommendation goes to the Acer predator
X 27 which is one of the only gaming
grade monitors I'd be happy recommending
for HDR it's still expensive and over
1,600 US dollars but it is a wide gamut
display with 384 zone F Ald backlighting
and 1000 nits of peak brightness it
looks phenomenal while gaming it's worth
keeping in mind that several other
high-quality HDR monitors are coming
soon the new ultra wide models with 512
zone F Ald backlights and 200 Hertz
refresh rates are almost here which
could interest some buyers with deep
pockets asus also has a new mini LED
model coming later this year which is
set to be similar to the predator X 27
but with a decent increase to the
backlight zones it could be worth
waiting for those displays if you're
planning to put
over $1,500 for an HDR monitor so that
sums up my current monitor
recommendations since last time updated
this list the 1440p and ultra wide
options have come down in price
significantly and form some of the best
buyers on the market today which is
great to see you can find links to
current prices for the monitors we've
recommended in the description below
