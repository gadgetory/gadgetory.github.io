really excited about today's monitor
review because the product I'm looking
at falls into my favorite category and
that is affordable but decent gaming
monitors lots of companies try and
target this market segment but it's
difficult to come away with a winner but
I think that LG might have just managed
it with their 32 G case 650 F this
monitor is 32 inches in size and packs a
1440p resolution with a 144 Hertz
refresh rate so it falls into that
golden zone for modern gaming but on top
of that it uses VA technology which is
popular with gamers and perhaps the best
for this type of display and crucially
it's flat which will please the curb
display haters LG hasn't bothered with
any HDR stuff here this is just your
standard 1440p high refresh monitor and
as a result its retailing right now for
just 350 US dollars this doesn't make it
the outright cheapest 1440p 144 Hertz
display on the market you can often find
others for around the 320 maybe 330
dollar mark like the vo-tech G + 27 DB
and GM 32 DB but there is genuinely lots
to like about the 32 GK 650 F which I'll
get into in the performance section I've
made a lot of LG monitor reviews over
the past few months so if you've watched
any of those this design will be very
familiar to you the 32 GK 650f uses LG's
current Ultra G's style which includes a
simple v-shaped stand made from black
plastic a basic front panel design with
slim bezels on three sides and again a
simple black plastic career which I
think looks pretty good there's a few
red highlights here giving the design a
bit of additional interest but it's not
overly game aesthetic and there's no RGB
LEDs here which I kind of appreciate
despite its simple design visually LG
has included a lot of functionality the
stand is fully height adjustable and
also supports tilting swiveling and even
pivoting so you can use this monitor in
a portrait orientation the sturdiness of
the stand is average but unlike a lot of
other budget monitors in this class it
actually supports a good range of motion
the ports are easily accessible on the
rear panel of though cable management
can be a little tricky the main ports
are DisplayPort and two HDMI ports plus
a headphone jack
no USB hub here although like the
emission of RGB LEDs I'm fine with this
Bank to say it costs the monitor does
require an external power brick though
LG's ultra gear line seems to mostly use
directional toggles but controlling the
on-screen menu which again is an
advantage this monitor has over some
alternatives and it's also quite a few
handy features to be found within like a
backlight strobing options some cheap
features like crosshairs and black level
adjustments for gamers this monitor has
a great feature set headlined by a 2560
by 1440 resolution and a maximum refresh
rate of 144 Hertz
it also has free sync support with low
framerate compensation and it's fully
compatible with NVIDIA GPUs although
free sync is disabled by default so make
sure you enable it some of the absolute
cheapest monitors with these specs do
not include adaptive sync so having hit
here is definitely welcome and basically
a requirement I think for any modern
gaming display response times for a VI
panel are better than average as well
there are several response time modes
but the default fast option is the best
with faster introducing a bit too much
overshoot still with the fast mode we're
looking at a greater great average
response of 6.5 zero milliseconds which
is faster than the required 6.9 for
milliseconds to transition fully at a
144 Hertz refresh rate aside from a few
particularly slow transitions this panel
is properly capable of a 144 Hertz
refresh around 80% of the time which is
better than average for a VA display in
fact when looking over the charts you
can see that of the 32 inch 1440p 144
Hertz VA monitors I've reviewed and
there have been a few it's quite a
popular product type the 32 GK 650 F is
the fastest the average response time
for this type is 7.7 milliseconds so
about 1 millisecond faster than expected
it's a great result for a VA and puts it
within IPS territory input lag is also
decent coming in at a 3.3 milliseconds
which is within the normal bracket we
see for gaming - this gives an overall
latency of below 10 milliseconds which
is what I like to see LG does list a
typical contrast ratio for this display
of 3000 to 1 although in my testing I
recorded more like 2400 to 1 which is a
fair bit lower but not unusual for this
sort of VA in fact with this result it
still sits around its competitors which
all slide in below 3000
as well it just seems this set of specs
leads to a lower contrast at least the
panel's being made with these specs have
a lower contrast that said even at 2400
to one the contrast ratio is still at
least double a typical IPS and will
still give you the contrast benefits of
this technology as for brightness 329th
is fine for most viewers particularly as
there's no HDR support here as for
colors well this is just your standard
srgb compliant panel so there's no wide
gamut support here although that does
make it easier to work with in most
cases as outside of HDR modes your
standard content is mastered for srgb so
to avoid over saturation you do want an
sRGB monitor default out-of-the-box
performance well it is an amazing though
and that's largely down to incorrect
grayscale performance a white point of
78 40 K which blooms out to an average
of 80 120 K over the grayscale range
means this monitor ships with a cold
blue tint some users like this but for
it to be correct you actually want to
warm a 6500 K white point so a grayscale
Delta II average of five point zero five
isn't surprising here it's a similar
story with saturation performance with a
cold white point you can see that the
rest of the color points have been
translated so everything has been
dragged colder than expected we get a
delta e average here of 3.26 with
particularly poor blue cyan and magenta
performance and you'll see similar
numbers with the colorchecker test
luckily the incorrect white point can be
corrected through a few tweaks in the
on-screen menu for my unit I said they
use the color controls to read 50 green
43 and blue 34 only the brightness of 61
for approximately 200 nits these
settings may not apply perfectly to
every 32 GK 650 f-22 panel variants both
should bring things a lot closer to
accurate with these settings applied
alone so no formal calibration just yet
the CCT curve had drastically improved
to an average of 68 55k which led to a
grayscale delta-e average of just one
point six six which is pretty damn
accurate for just a few setting tweaks
this helped out a lot with saturation
leading to adults a average of one point
three nine and colorchecker which
improves to one point five three with
averages below 2.0 across-the-board this
sort of performance is pretty accurate
from here you could go and perform a
proper calibration which does tighten
things up further
it's it's even better at Gama and so on
but for most users I think these basic
tweaks will suffice especially if your
model has shipped with a noticeable blue
tint if you want my calibrated ICC
profile as always that is provided for
our patreon members lastly we have
uniformity which as expected for a VA
panel is a touch on the mediocre side
the center channel is good enough but as
you look to either edge there's a bit of
deviance relative to the center nothing
drastic it is somewhat noticeable but
for gaming it's not a big deal and you
won't get much better from a competing
v8 monitor all up the 32 GK 650f is my
new favorite affordable high refresh
gaming monitor and that's not a crown
that I give out lightly or easily I've
spoken before about how 1440p 144 Hertz
is my favorite monitor hardware for
gaming right now it's that great
combination of resolution and refresh
rate that's achievable with modern GPU
tech and the 32 GK 650f delivers that
with the best feature set at a great
price previously I used to recommend
monitors like the vo-tech GN 32 DB or
the pic Co px 3 to 9 in this category
the biotech option being curved in about
$330 while the pic Co is flat and 350
dollars but with the 32 GK 650f also
slotting in at $350 it simply offers
more than the alternatives at that price
and I'd have no hesitation in spending
an extra twenty dollars if required
specifically the 32 GK 650f has faster
response times which reduces blur and
provides a true 144 Hertz experience
unlike the pic 0 which is advertised as
165 Hertz but really can't deliver 144
Hertz let alone that higher refresh rate
it's still a large 32 inch VA panel with
good contrast and a flat design which I
feel is better than curved alternatives
and it comes with a better stand that's
height and pivot adjustable which
neither biotech nor pixi offer crucially
this monitor is also much easier to find
as in via tech or pixel monitors which
are only sold in North America it's not
as good value here in Australia where it
retails for $600 but it should still be
a great option in a number of
territories globally it's another
perfect monitor but there's no glaring
flaws here so when you're offering the
best value proposition it's really hard
not to recommend it
