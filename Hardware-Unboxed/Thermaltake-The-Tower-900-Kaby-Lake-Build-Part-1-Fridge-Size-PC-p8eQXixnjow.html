today I have a what I hope will be a
pretty cool video for you guys basically
as you know KB Lake was just released
and although it wasn't super exciting
it's still a really efficient really
powerful platform especially if you pick
up something like these 7700 K speaking
of which I've grabbed a spare 7700 k
processor and I plan to make a pretty
special build with it I reached out to
the good folks at thermaltake and told
them that I plan to build let's just say
a pretty epic a pretty epic build this
time as some of you probably remember or
hopefully remember not that long ago we
did a really cool custom hard pipe
liquid-cooled build with Thermaltake in
their core Petrie chassis when they were
releasing that chassis they wanted to do
something pretty cool with it and we
said you know let's do that build and
they went for it and we have we put
together a hell of a rig which we're
still using today and very much loved it
anyway KB Lakes here and we thought
let's go bigger and hopefully better
so yes Thermaltake has provided their
new tower 900 case which we'll look at
in a moment but they've also provided
not one but two of their hard pipe what
is it it's the Pacific RL 360 kit so we
have not one but Oh quite heavy two of
these so it'll be a dual loop system and
yeah it's probably going to take a fair
bit of time to put together but we're
going to get started for this video
we'll put all the parts because I'm not
even 100 potential of everything that's
going into it there is a lot of hardware
but it's all worked out and been
delivered so we'll get through it so
yeah there's these two kits which you
will have if you've watched the p3 build
series you will have seen what's in
these kits but basically at a three
sixty millimeter radiator pump and a
large reservoir three fans with fan
controller number of fittings your hard
tubes CPU water block
and just all the stuff connect that and
some some liquid so yeah we'll have
we'll end up with two CPU blocks well I
need one I'll quickly just go through it
actually so we have a pair of these very
thick three hundred and sixty millimeter
radiators and they're going to go in
either side of the case but look at that
shortly I believe both kits come with
the red liquid though we won't be using
the red liquid for this build the color
scheme will be I think black white and
blue similar pump to what we used last
time the Pacific W one water block which
is different to the water block we used
for the core piece rebuild this one
isn't the acrylic block so not quite as
flashy but still cool looking block and
it will do the trick nicely
you got something to jumpstart your
power supply so you can test the loop
without powering up all your components
so nothing will be sure to do if there
is a leak and we have a number of
fittings easily the fittings that come
in the kit I think then we'll take a
provide a few extra fitting so we'll
check that in a moment and a trio of
their ring 120 millimeter RGB fans with
the fan controller which will be
somewhere in the package oh it's
probably on the box actually anyway
they're cool and some hard pipes so that
will be useful when we get to building
wonder if they're going to be long
enough I've got a couple of longer ones
somewhere we may have to use them
because I don't know if they're going to
be long enough for the tower 900 and
when I rip this case out in a minute
you'll see what I'm talking about so
basically we've got double of everything
you've just seen
not not sure what's in this box it's
very white looks like we just have this
in here
whatever this is these are the same TT
mod sleeve cables that we use so the p3
bill so they're they're black and blue
one so that will help finish the build
off and have a smaller but much heavier
box okay so we have very cool-looking
white cooling here very cool
another bottle of red which is
interesting because I'm pretty sure I
want to be using black and white I'm
asked to double check my notes on that
and then speak to Thermaltake ah they've
actually upgraded this to the Pacific w3
block so I looked at the w1 block a
moment ago it looks like we're using oh
we are awesome we have the acrylic block
which is what we use last time it looks
very awesome so we won't be using this
block yeah the nice eye acrylic block
last time we stuck some clear LEDs
underneath and I lit the block up and
the liquid inside it and that looked
really cool one of the coolest effects
of the whole build actually to ask you
more plugs they could be useful
a couple more fittings and what do we
have here are some 90 degree fitting
well a lot a lot of 90 degree fittings
but for a jeweler system we're probably
going to need quite a few so as you can
see we're using chrome fittings for this
one and there's one of the 90 degree
bends so here's a liquid I'm going to
have to look into because I'm pretty
sure we're meant to be using white and
black and par the reason that is because
this is the motherboard we'll be using
for the build
so this is gigabytes new horas brand z2
70 motherboard and it is easy to 70x
gaming 7 as the box there yeah it's an
awesome looking motherboard as what
looks likes got some cool LED lighting
between the DIMM slots there I believe
there's some LED lighting below the PCI
Express slots and some up here in the
eye
cover so yeah a very cool-looking
motherboard and that'll be the center of
our bills so the grand finale what this
is going to be built in is the Tower 900
not enough you guys have seen or heard
about this case yet the brand new case
from thermaltake it's probably their
biggest ever and yeah it's cool to the
tower 900 we have the white or snow
edition version of the case and the box
weighs about 30 kilos I'll show you why
in a minute when you see the size of it
soaked up three thick tempered glass
panels oh don't even think that will fit
in the frame how about that if I managed
to fit the whole thing in as you can see
it is a massive taste what's a massive
box but I presume the case inside is
fairly large as well let's take it apart
and find out so that there is the Tower
900 Oh see I'm gonna have to get a lot
fitter if I plan on moving this thing
around more in the future
so he can buy two new zed 270
motherboard it's probably going to look
quite small in there I think it'll be
orientated something like that about
there that I'm yeah plenty of room for
expansion we shouldn't have any trouble
at all fitting the dual loop system in
there should be plenty of room to work
I'm very very keen to see how it will
look like done yeah this little bar
fridge definitely makes for a very cool
case but it's not something you want to
want to be moving ever really but I just
build it where you're going to put it
and leave it there because yeah it's
heavy I suppose if you remove the
tempered glass panels that would reduce
the weight significantly if you had to
move it a lot but I can't even begin to
imagine how heavy this thing is going to
be once we have all the hardware inside
and he's a liquid the radiators the pump
graphics card hard drive the whole lot
it is going to be nudging I reckon 50
kilos full so the interesting last row
and weigh it so I will be documenting
the whole build process but right now
has to be honest I really have no idea
how I'm going to route all the tubes and
connect everything up yeah so I'll
probably just play that one by you see
how we go I'll probably do what we do
with the Corp III build that is fit the
motherboard the graphics card all the
hardware and then work out you know
we'll put the reservoir in the pump the
radios all that sort of stuff and then
sort of get start to visualize how I'm
going to connect everything up and what
will look best yeah that will probably
be in the part two or three of this
series so I'm not quite sure how many
parts they'll be it really depends on
how long it takes me to build this thing
I really have no idea at this stage but
we'll get into it and we'll see where we
end up so with that I think we've had a
good look at most the bits they'll still
be well there's things like the memory
not quite sure what I'll be using there
just yet we also have the power supply
probably using something around at 850
watt model there abouts we'll see then I
have to pick
SSD probably use something like the
samsung 960 pro what else if we go work
out then just some hard drives from the
hard drive storage and then for the
grammys color I won't be using the GTX
1080 or the Titan XP for this build I
will be using just a lowly 1070 so we'll
have to make do with that but I'm sure
we sign and yeah I'm not really sure
what the purpose or point of this build
will be apart of the fact that it's just
going to be awesome so what more do you
need right anyway that's all for this
one I expect an update with some build
progress very shortly so I'll catch you
guys next time
see
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
