this is part two about November Q&amp;amp;A part
1 was on the channel yesterday as always
we have a ton more questions to cover
this we'll be covering them in this
video so I guess let's get straight into
them as a great question I deliberately
put in here for Steve cuz he loves
talking about this you always get me in
trouble yeah oh so good if you need a
budget work station is the FX 8350 still
relevant
all the top boards and ddr3 a chip
what's your pin on FX T I love the way
I'm often called an AMD fanboy I love it
because the people that say that must
have been snoozing through the entire FX
generation because I was the biggest
Intel fanboy then apparently but for
those of you that are maybe new to the
channel or familiar with my opinion on
the FX series I really really disliked a
Murray's FX series a loathe that would
be a good word I recommend pretty much
anything but I don't really want to
argue with people in the comments
because I know I trigger a good many
people when I say this but I feel like
the FX series was never worth it pretty
much any price point it was actually a
rare bad product in my opinion there's
people out there that disagree with me
and that's perfectly fine but that's my
opinion on it and it has been since I
first reviewed it I was really worried
about rise and being the same but
thankfully it wasn't risin is brilliant
but yeah if you need a budget
workstation there's just so many better
alternatives I'm sort of pushing people
away from directing people away from
buying their Xeon stuff I don't think
the older Xeon stuff on the LGA 1366
sockets worth it anymore either
because newer new parts are since rising
came out you can buy a second-hand risin
5 you know 1600 or 1800 X processor for
next to nothing you can get be 350
motherboards or X 370 boards really
cheap I've saw an X 4 so when you bought
it sell for $40 us on ebay not that long
ago so you pick up one of them you can
get a good rise in processor for $100
and yeah I mean you can get the FX stuff
cheaper someone probably just about give
you
system but whether you want to run it's
another question but it's the same thing
with their Xeon stuff if you can get a Z
on you know memory motherboard and
processor for like 50 bucks if you get
lucky then sure but you can't beat that
in terms of value I still you couldn't
pay me to use an FX system that's just
me
I really just like them just my personal
opinion from lots of testing don't like
them so I'd be getting a second hand
rise and rege because they're very cheap
now and that's yeah I'd rather pay two
three times more for that I think you'd
be getting more value for money yep
sounds fun don't ever ask me at the FX
series again I'm done with it
okay this next question is from YouTube
now you done asked me about FX
processors and then you go to Apple
products
alright Steve's done he's the iPad pro
really as powerful as a laptop he's
really gone by the way he's just left so
this is an interesting question for a
number of reasons because there's always
a lot of discussion with iPads you know
people trying to compare them to laptops
people talking about ARM processors and
sort of doing those benchmarks like
Geekbench and comparing you know how
fast is the iPad and Geekbench to an
Intel laptop and I'm not a big fan of
comparing those two things for a number
of reasons firstly because they both
want completely different apps and
completely different operating systems
so it's really hard to get like a
real-world workload that's running on an
iPad pro and you can just run the exact
same thing on an Intel processor ARM
processors also have a lot of
acceleration built into them so you're
not necessarily using the CPU cores for
things like basic video encoding or
decoding you have got a whole bunch of
stuff that's accelerated as well and on
top of that their apps are just built in
a completely different way to be much
more optimized for the resources that
are in an ARM chip so there's a lot more
GPU acceleration there's a lot more
acceleration on those things I was just
talking about so yeah I just don't think
the comparisons that we've got at the
moment really are telling us all that
much about that comparison we really
need to wait to Apple to put their arm
chip in an actual laptop running the
same code the exact same applications
doing the same thing to see what the
difference is going to be like
I would think that you know iPad pro
probably struggle with some of the
rendering tasks that you can do on a
laptop simply because it's you know
power of clock speed limits they're just
fundamental limitations so yeah I still
think Intel would probably come out more
powerful if you compare you know apples
to apples but really at the moment just
comparing apples to oranges so yeah too
hard to say you can come back now Steve
we're done yeah I promise I don't think
so I think that's it I am back next
question how does AMD bed not be effects
related I compete with Intel with the
same core counts yet much lower clock
speeds seems like Intel should it be far
and away better well they kind of are
did I say that out loud
I meant No yeah and all seriousness
Intel does have a performance advantage
because of the clock speed advantage the
way AMD competes is by making their CPUs
well better value more affordable
cheaper that's pretty much that one yeah
so for example if the rise in 720 700 X
and 87 okay forget about the 99 okay if
the 2700 X and 87 okay with the exact
same price or the 87 okay was cheaper
then for the most part you'd get that I
mean it's a bit of an unfair comparison
because the 2700 X is better in
productivity because it does have two
extra cores so I suppose a better one
would be the the 2700 X and the 1900 K
same core count same thread count if
they were even remotely the same price
you would buy Intel sorry AMD fans
that's just yeah it's the trustor it's
faster and assuming the platform costs
of the same so Intel comes there sorry
AMD comes out well ahead in that
comparison in terms of value and I would
personally buy the 2700 X every time I
wouldn't even entertain the 1900 K as a
consumer because you're paying at least
$500 u.s. you can get I'd get a
seven 2700 what are they now at 250
pretty cheap yeah you're getting cooler
as well whereas you know you have to
spend at least $30 for a cool afternoon
and okay and then you're not running
that anywhere near full performance on a
$30 cool you're pretty much running at
the 95 watt TDP spec and their
motherboards you can get a hundred and
ten dollar B 450 tomahawk fantastic
board that'll take the 2700 no dramas
whereas you probably want to spend about
$67 more on a good Zed 390 board um see
it's just comes down on value yeah
that's pretty much it
okay next question and this one looks to
be RTX related I'm actually surprised
given your video they haven't all been
in some way ray-tracing related anyway
well gets the question seeing how the
r-tx cards struggle to use all the GPU
and running DX are definitely the case
how do you think say a tu 106 GPU so for
those of you not familiar that's the RT
X 2070 so the 2070 but with the same
amount of RT causes the 2828 e TI I
would then have been a more balanced
offering so I think what he's trying to
say here is with the 27 t have made more
sense with the same amount of RT cause
again the highest impact yes so more RT
cos essentially in the 27 t which is 720
70 more expensive yeah I mean that's the
thing first of all adding those extra
cause in increases the die size so
they'll cost more to manufacture and
then it'll mean it'll cost more but
let's just say that there's a mythical
27 t that had the same articles at the
same price yeah it would make more sense
and would make that card make more says
fun ray-tracing because you'd actually
be less bottlenecks by its complete lack
of RT cause like you've currently got
the shader cores in that so if you were
just sitting around doing not much in
that game because that's just so choked
up by trying to do ray tracing once yes
I suppose that's essentially the
question so you would be getting the
same performance as what I what the
question is is the RT cause
bottlenecking
the CUDA cores so much yeah that you
actually wouldn't see a difference in
performance and I so yeah that's
probably the case I would say that
almost certainly the 27 t would perform
like a 20 atti
if the RT core count was the same
because not only do we see lower power
consumption running the cards in with
ray-tracing it also gets bottlenecks
much much more severely the higher the
resolution goes and that tends to
indicate that you know it's not gonna be
the shaded causes doing it simply
because it's trying to push out more
rays into the scene and the more rays
that you're pushing out the lower the
performance that you get is so because
we're a twenty eighty I can run at like
20 FPS at best at 4k with the
ray-tracing in battlefield five so yeah
I would say that would have been a much
better balance it wouldn't have made any
sense from a cost perspective because in
all the games that don't use ray tracing
that card with a cost more and would
have delivered still the same
performance as a GTX 1080 at this yeah
but just at a higher price so yeah it
would have been nice if Nvidia did that
but logistically it's not really
possible no really they shouldn't have
even offered racing on that part to be
asked well that's not that's actually
that's a whole other question I would
certainly hope in a future generation
that the RT core count does increase
quite significantly with these parts you
know just 27 nanometer maybe they could
put a few more in that would definitely
make her so that 2070 type product then
a better better value yet a lot more and
a lot more crop yeah that is true okay
this next question I actually really
like this so go through that first and I
sort of explain what it means if you
sort of don't get it what's the best
value build price isn't a variable since
I'm looking for the best value out there
out of each part so planning a parent
with a 1080p 75 Hertz ultrawide monitor
so this is kind of where I come at PC
hardware from it's like this this person
saying they've got whatever money it
takes to do it but they don't want to
they don't want it ain't for you but
they don't want to reach the point of
diminishing returns and then go beyond
it they want the best bang for their
buck which is how we review everything
and that's how I want to buy anything in
life so yeah that's how what we think
most of you guys well yeah if you're
buying sits makes sense I mean you work
for your money you want it to then get
the most value yep you want to spend it
wisely so having said all that we've
certainly done a lot of videos on the
channel about you know best value
products so that's a motherboard
CPUs GPUs tend update those really often
my best value all-rounder and sub $200
CPU right now is the rise than five 2600
yeah so short of any Black Friday deals
or anything like that which will have
ended by the time this video goes up
it's been around that one $60 price
point well before Black Friday thang yes
that's right that's why I brought that
price up so that will continue so
probably rise in five 2600 is best bang
for your buck CPU and it'll go well into
the future without problems graphics
card for 1080p it's only 75 Hertz
probably only on our x57 yeah when you
look at cost per frame RX v 7e we have
to be up there is the best value overall
yeah how much performance you get from
that price obviously well not as good
value you know at 1440p an RX 570 it's
gonna struggle a bit sure I'd go yet RX
570 or rx 584 gigabyte yeah they're both
ridiculously very good value for
gigabyte for iup not a problem you can
easily choose settings there to make it
not a problem
ultra wide monitor that's where I'll
hand that over to you yeah I think he
already has the ultra wide lock does it
appeal it is morally opposed but again
like I say if you're at 1440p you're
probably more looking at like Vega 56 or
the 1070 TI I think was when we last
looked at it both very good value cards
if they're still yeah 1070 TI still in
the market I mean that that's a
situation where they're not the best
absolute best bang for you buck the RX
570 would be that product but if you if
you have a 1440p monitor then you're
gonna run into problems so kind of you
have to make some design considerations
well pretend you okay though yeah but
NAB definitely our exfoliant for
motherboard well be 450 yeah again I'd
probably up the tomahawk because then
everyone upgrade to higher end CPUs
later on that won't be a problem so
that's yeah that's a pretty
straightforward 16 Giga RAM as well it's
probably around the mark and then
alternatively I'd look for something
like maybe a GTX 1063 gigabyte I kinda
hate recommending the three gigabyte
card because it does have a limited of
erm but it has proven to be really good
it's good thing good value so if you can
get one of
those really cheap around the same
prices and Eric's 570 that might be a
good alternative on the CPU front though
there's nothing from Intel that competes
with rise than 528 if that is fair to
say definitely got performance at the
top end but if you're looking go bang
for your buck it's probably not there
yeah okay next question from good dog
what do you think in video will or can
do to restore consumer trust after the
churring fiasco hmm well I don't think
they have to do they they set your ship
with good products yeah and I think I
don't what has their reputation really
been that damaged I think most people
bought them are loving it yeah I mean
something I sort of a few issues with
the 2080 TI you know the RMA type stuff
but then again you know that could
happen with really any product launch
you could have just a bad batch yeah I
mean it's looking like it may extend
beyond a bad batch I don't know that's
that's a tough one to put a finger on
what's going on there if you've bought a
really expensive graphics card you've
had it die if had are made that died
then that's probably bad you depending
on what that person's like and how much
they loved the car when it finally
started working that might be a custom
and it's hard to recover especially if
am become swinging with a really good 7
nanometre product but in video you are
pretty well on top at the moment they're
going to stay on top for the foreseeable
so they can afford a few slip-ups here
and there I mean if you're selling a
graphics card some people pay like $1400
yeah if you're selling graphics cards
are $1,400 yeah you've probably got a I
mean you're not struggling to sell
graphics cards it's basic what I'm
getting at
yeah see and I mean a lot of the things
ensuring that you know we've been
criticizing a lot in our reviews and in
our follow-up coverage of you know
things like rate racing deal SS you know
the pricing at launch all that sort of
sort of stock isn't really like a trust
issue because like Nvidia while you know
the demos that they showed at launch for
ray tracing it hasn't ended up as
impressive they did actually ship a card
that did ray tracing
you know DL SS it's probably not as
impressive again as they show but it is
a feature that you can use it's just
those sort of things
yeah we knew going into it the support
was limited and stuff yeah so all those
things you know companies always try and
present their products as best as they
can and video went with the different
strategies unusual they focus more on
the features like our TX over just the
simple performance improvements over the
previous card so yeah I mean that's kind
of what it is I don't think those things
necessarily hurt trust it just didn't
make the product is good when it came
out yeah if AMD come up with something
relatively early next year which I think
they will but yeah without it being
towards the end of the and then Nvidia
also plan a new series on a new process
media towards the end of the year that's
probably gonna upset a few r-tx 20 80 TI
investors especially if the new product
is significantly better which should be
yeah I mean the issue with in ambe's
architectures that they're still quite
far behind and the architecture front
like invidious architecture is much more
- it's much much better in terms of even
like power consumption on the existing
nodes like 12 nanometers in video is
miles ahead of AMD so they certainly
have a lot of work to do on seven
enemies and it'll be very interesting
yes I can bring a lot of that stand to
the process used as well with Global
Foundries being behind TSMC but yeah
it'll be interesting to see okay next
question quite funny because I was
coming to you Tim how knackered I am
before he's done this QA that's
following a sleepers were leading up to
it not forgive your questions just
because he's an old man that's why yeah
well that's partly because of it and
also because I was up really late last
night
testing CPU performance in battlefield 5
multiplayer boy oh boy is on a chore
taking me ages and then the hardware
limit thing which EA hasn't roofed my
account and I'm working with their tech
support to try and get it removed but no
updates are progress their fingers cross
they can do something for me anyway on
to this question that created that
little detour how much sleep do you guys
get with all the benchmark and all I'm
guessing it's better to say in seconds
yeah it's not that bad I mean go 4 or 5
hours here and there
it depends on what we're doing really
for like the ray-tracing thing where
they enabled that in battlefield 5 and
they happen to do it at like 6 o'clock
our time or something I wonder I got
testing that at about at 10 11 yes and
we're here at work the update to
download had to update windows yeah we
wanted to get that content done the next
day and Tim said well we can make it
happen if you do the benchmarking and I
do all the image quality stuff so I
think I wrapped up the benchmarking the
early hours of the morning and yeah same
here I've got the quality captures done
around that point and if I go to bed
really late for some reason I just wake
up early it's earlier than I would
normally it's some weird defect I have
so I woke up at like 7 o'clock I
messaged him at 7:30 and said how's it
going and he was awake he's like yeah
I'm working on the script now it's like
you animal so yeah we depends on what
time of year it is and what product
launches we have and what's going on but
yeah we're put in a lot of hours ok
another question from a discord chat do
you think your testing methodology
should be based on the idea that people
want to play at high frame rates like
100 FPS or that people want to play at
the standard 60fps hmm well over the
years I have thought about this sort of
thing quite a bit basically I think we
don't really want to assume anything and
I think that's the problem a lot of
people do they when we test say lowering
graphics cards with a higher end CPU
they're like why don't you test that
doesn't make sense test with the core i3
but you're assuming then that everyone's
gonna use a low-end processor a while
it's more likely they're gonna use a low
in process or a post or a high-end one
you're then assuming that with that
graphics card they're never going to
update the processor or that they're not
going to use medium quality settings so
you've got a you obviously can't test
every situation because we'd be testing
for 10 times longer than we're doing we
already test for an absurd amount of
time so you've got to find some sort of
middle ground there that gives you
useful information that's also somewhat
realistic as well so with the 60 to 100
FPS there's not really any point
targeting testing methods for 60 FPS
because in my opinion 60 FPS is like
borderline too low I always target over
hundred FPS for your battlefield 5 type
games but again I'm not assuming
everyone's like me so we just test a
middle ground that makes the most sense
okay we're getting near the end here
we've got a couple of serious questions
to get through some burning questions
yeah that was a terrible pun ok the
question is how long does it take to
make a burrito on the 90 her case IHS
while running I 264 mmm I don't really
know what how to answer that one um
Bobby it's probably like you making a
chicken burrito for example is it does
it get hot enough to actually fried
chicken on there if you had a pan that
had like it was like manufactured to
come down to the yeah and you're using
that as the cooler
you could probably cook an egg yeah I
reckon so lemme what does it take to
cook an egg I don't know depends how
quickly you want cooks because you can
cook it low and slow true so well I
suppose you could maybe you can easily
with a bit of voltage get them out get
them up to like Turner watts okay are we
answering this stupid question too
technically or trying to
I think logistically though the hardest
part would be trying to get the pan onto
there if you if you're just using the
IHS it would be a long panics individual
piece of chicken so yeah anyway let's
just move on from that one okay we've
got a question here from a0 drive and
zero drivers guilty of not watching
every single video we make so come on go
back and watch all the archive what
you're doing
question is is Ram speed a large factor
for performance in games 2400 versus
3200 ddr4 for example well I did a video
that pretty much compared though it was
actually 2666 and 3200 that I compared
and it was on Intel processors so it was
a video for Intel users but it somewhat
applies for AMD as well
and it's just one of those questions
like a lot of these questions we get
asked in a very general manner it's like
what games you're playing
what CPU what graphics card what
resolution and quality settings
so for the most part it makes no
difference at all with if you've got a
GTX 1060 then pretty much all other
things are irrelevant it makes no
difference if you've got a gtx 1070 TI
if you're playing at 1080p then it can
make a difference if you've got you know
if you're playing a cpu intensive title
if you're playing a GPU intensive title
light falls on Rison for no difference
at all if you're playing battlefield 5
it will make a bit of a difference and
then if you're using a high end GPU then
will tend to make even more of a
difference again in CPU intensive titles
more so so it's a very general question
that really depends on your setup so if
you're using a GTX 1060 there know for
using a higher end say RG 2 extender
you're higher than yeah we'll start to
make a small difference watch my video
because I tested I tested medium high
and ultra quality setting presets
there's about six games so I tested
three quality presets I tested 1440p and
1080p and I tested core i3 Core i5 and
core i7 processors but we should put a
card or something oh actually what they
know is at that side I'm not sure one
other side does it we'll put a card up
somewhere - a link to that video yeah
that's your job ok you can do that
hopefully future Steve doesn't forget to
do that yep ok another question from our
discord chat how do you guys feel about
gigabyte advertising there or as RAM as
high performance Samsung B die memory it
technically is B die when it has loose C
L 16 timings and even overclocked to the
max can't handle tighter seal 15
charging as much as actual high
performance B die such as g.skill flare
X I feel like this is cheating consumers
by implying it will perform as well as
other B die memory will well look B die
memory like most things as Bend so you
get your really great cell 14 stuff yeah
Mac cell 15 stuff and then yeah not
really good at all just like doesn't
make the cut almost CL 16 and then you
get the defective stuff that you never
hear about I mean I think the thing is
is that it's not false advertising yeah
that's exactly right it's going to say
it's if it's advertised as
some beer died at seal 16 and is a
samsung BJ and it runs the sale 16
timings then you've got what you've paid
for if they're trying to overclock
overlocking is always a bonus that you
can get on top of what is advertised so
you're never going to be guaranteed
overclocking of any product some people
are going to be lucky and they'll be
able to push the seal 15 or lower and
obviously in this buyers case they
haven't been as lucky that's just
sometimes that works yeah it's very
different to something like a GT 1030
situation where you got your GT 1030
gddr5 version and then later on they
quietly push out a ddr4 version with
nowhere near the same level of
performance that's much more dodgy and
we don't stand for that but this it's
pretty clearly specified how it runs and
all that sort of stuff and it's memory
so you met like the main thing you look
at a memory is the frequency that it
operates at and then the timings and if
they've made all that clear then yeah
just like in this case
well you've read some reviews check some
stuff out if it's the same price as gee
skills flare-ups then you definitely
wouldn't buy the gigabyte ora stuff you
would buy the g.skill flare ex okay so
that's I guess all of the questions fall
out November Q&amp;amp;A locks alone I think
we've been at this for about an hour now
so plenty of fun stuff in the Q&amp;amp;A video
of course you can like this video you
can subscribe to us on YouTube you can
support us on patreon to get access to
stuff like our discord chat which is
always a bit of fun throughout the
throughout the month it's actually
building quite nicely the lot of you
just go in there yeah lots of discussion
we'll do our monthly live stream as well
which I'm sure you've heard about before
and I guess that's it we'll see you in
another Q&amp;amp;A which will be happening in
December as well yep probably late
December but it will happen in December
