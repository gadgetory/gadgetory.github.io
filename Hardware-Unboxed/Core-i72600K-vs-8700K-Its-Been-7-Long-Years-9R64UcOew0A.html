today's video I'm dusting off my old
sandy brooch core i7 2670 TX 1080i
graphics card to see how well it holds
up and all the latest and greatest
gaming titles actually more precisely I
want to see how much of a step forward
the new core i7 87 or ek is when
compared to the seven-year-old quad core
we know that the 22-ton arcade still has
game but for those rockin the old quad
core next you could finally be the year
they find themselves in need of that
long-awaited upgrade the gtx 980ti might
be the pinnacle of gaming right now but
before you reach at this time next year
there's likely going to be something
even better and as a result you can
expect mid range GPUs to have a little
more poke for testing the core i7 2670
dolls on hand each of which has been
tested using three different quality
presets the focus here will be on the
1080p resolution but we also have some
1440p results as well though of course
these are more GPU bound but many of you
seem more interested in those results so
I have included them recently I compared
the fourth generation Core i7 4770k
under the same test conditions and found
that while still hanging in there
remarkably well even with the mighty GTX
10 atti so will the much older
second-generation 2600 K proved just as
impressive let's jump in the benchmarks
to find out shall we
first up we have ashes of the
singularity see I said it right I bet
you weren't expecting that so ahead of
the box the 2600 K delivered these same
69 FPS minimum and 77 fps average and
that made it a little over 40% slower
than the 8700 cave surprisingly
overclocking the 2600 K to 4 point 8
gigahertz only placed it on par with the
stock 4770k and while that did allow for
very playable performance it was still
around 30% slower than the 8700 K now
increasing the visual quality settings
with the extreme preset that didn't
really change much here the 2600 K was
28% slower than 87 okay so it's still
trailed by a rather
significant margin now it's time to get
all crazy I feel like they oversold this
preset but anyway here we have a mostly
GPU bound scenario though even so out of
the box the twenty-sixth enrique takes a
beating for the average frame rate
overclocked performance was boosted by
22 percent 28 fps and now the 2600 K is
only 9% slower than the majority of
these seventh and eighth generation CPUs
then finally the last ashes of the
benchmark test was conducted at 1440p
and here the margins close up a little
more but even so the overclocked 2600 K
was still around 6% slower than the more
modern Intel processors right so next up
we have the battlefield 1 results and
boy has the core i7 2618 this one at
least when used in the medium quality
settings at 1080p with a mighty powerful
graphics card under those conditions it
does look pretty slow but then it is a 7
year old CPU so keeping that in mind
it's actually quite impressive anyway
here it was again a roughly 40% slower
than the 87 and ok and even when
overclocked struggles to match the stock
4770k increasing the visual quality
settings with the high preset doesn't
really change much the 2600 K is almost
40% slower than the 8700 ok and once
overclocked again falls just short of
the stock 4770k which is quite a
surprising result I have to say even
with the ultra quality settings enabled
the 2600 K still gets completely
trampled here it was 35% slower than the
stock 8700 K that's it with both CPU is
overclocked a margin is reduced to 22%
for the average though I should note the
87 RK is GPU limited for this test the
1% low result is a better indicator of
true performance and here the 2600 K was
30% slower it's worth pointing out
though that most gtx 980ti
earners they're probably not that
interested in playing battlefield 1 at
such a low resolution 1440p certainly
seems more appropriate here we find an
even more GPU limit scenario as a result
the 2600 K was just 9% sold nearly 700 K
when comparing the average frame rate
once both CPU is what overclocked
of course these are the 1% low results
that we probably should focus on in here
the 2600 K while still 21%
and that's certainly a noteworthy
deficit next up we have dawn of war 3
and here this stock 2600 came makes out
quite poorly it has to be said dipping
below 60 FPS at times interestingly
memory speed doesn't appear to have much
or any of an impact here and that's not
something I would have guessed to be
honest evidently a big part of the issue
here is the clock speed as the 2600 case
saw a very nice 28 percent boost an
average frame rate and a 26 percent
boost for the 1% low result once
overclocked that said though it was
still 23% slower than the overclocked
80s seminar okay but that's the closest
medium quality test result we've seen
yet increasing the visual quality
settings with the high preset changed
virtually nothing as we see almost the
exact same frame rates and as a result
the same margins even with the maximum
quality settings today well we see
almost no difference in frame rate from
the medium quality settings
we're obviously extremely CPU bound in
this title
that said though jumping to 1440p where
both CPU and GPU bound depending on
which configuration you look at even so
the overclocked 22-ton RK was still 22
percent sold 97 or okay when comparing
the one percent low results but just 14%
slower for the average framerate thanks
to the 8th gen series being limited by
the GTX 1080 Ti Wow here is another
title where the stock 2600 K looks
painfully slow compared to the more
modern processors
even the 4770k is world's faster here in
fact once again overclocked in the
22-ton arcade a 4.8 gigahertz isn't even
enough to see it overtake these stock
4770k
this means overclock the 2600 k is 28%
slower than the 8700 k increasing the
visual quality settings to very high
reduce the 28% margin seen previously
ever so slightly to 25% then with the
ultra quality settings enabled the 87
ROK and its eight generation pals slam
into a GPU brick wall as they find
themselves locked at an average of 90
FPS these are for to the overclocked
2600 k the opportunity to catch up and
now it's just 13% slower
of course the margin is reduced even
further at 40
40p and now the overclock 2600 k is just
three percent slower as the games
primarily GPU bound at this point moving
on we have dirt 4 and this time
overclocking the 2600 cater 4.8
gigahertz was enough to nudge it ahead
of the stock 4770k albeit just ahead
this meant overclocked it was 27% slower
than the overclocked 8700 k
interestingly increase in the quality
preset sees the overclocked 2600 a full
quite some distance behind the stock
4770k and as a result it's near 31
percent slower than the overclocked 8700
K I'm not sure what's gone wrong for the
2600 K here so let's move on to the
ultra quality preset to see what we find
here we do see a similar situation and
although the overclocked 2600 K has
managed to close in on the 87 okay
that's really only due to the fact that
the 8th generation processors have found
the limits of the 1080 to I again you'll
notice that the 2600 K is still quite a
long way behind the 4770k
that's really quite an interesting
result even at 1440p the overclocked 26
and arcade trails the 4770k by quite a
large margin despite nudging closer to a
GPU bound 8700 k still the 1% low result
for the overclocked 2600 k is
surprisingly low here it's still 23%
slower than the 4770k
and moving right along next up we have
f1 2017 and although the 22 enrique does
trail behind the pack by quite a large
margin it also provided well over 100
FPS at all times so highly playable
performance then still if we use f1 2017
as a measuring stick with the medium
quality settings the 2016 or k was 23%
solid 97 okay and 27 percent slower once
both CPUs are overclocked jumping up to
the higher quality settings and here we
see that once overclocked for 2600 K is
able to nudge your head of the 4770k
this time still it was 26 percent sold
nearly seminary hay when comparing the
overclocked results now with the ultra
high quality preset enabled the gtx
1080i starts to limit the performance of
the 87 or okay and this means
overclocked for 2600 k is now just 12%
slower then finally increase in the
resolution of 1440 p results in a heavy
GPU bottleneck
now the 2600 K is just 6% solid 8700 K
though it does only roughly match the
stock 4770k assassin's creed origins
buckles the core i7 2600k breaking it
down to just 52 FPS at times before we
overclock then once overclocked we still
see dips as low as 62 FPS and this meant
it was around 30% slower than the 87
okay which I should note was till GPU
limited even with the medium quality
preset enabled interestingly the margin
for the 1% lower result grows with the
high quality preset enabled now they
overclocked 2600 hay is 33% slower and
of course the 87 RK is still GPU limited
the 2600 case average framerate result
is more impressive but that 1% low
figure clearly shows the aging quad core
struggles with this title even when
overclocked now with the ultra high
quality settings enabled the overclocked
2600 code trails by a country mile when
looking at the 1% low data here it was
31% sold in 87 ok which is still heavily
GPU bound
I had a shroom when testing the 4770k at
the poor minimum FPS performance was
down to the use of slower ddr3 memory
but limited memory balance doesn't
appear to be the issue here when
comparing the 2600 k with 1600 and 2133
memory
interestingly at 1440p we start to see
some separation between the various
eighth generation cpus we're looking at
the 1% of low result and I have to say
that's kind of unexpected although the
average frame rates are much the same
across the board there is a reasonably
large variance in the 1% low figures
here the overclocked 2600 K will still
18% sold nearly 700 K though it did
match the core i5 8400 like f1 2017 the
frame rates are quite high in project
cars with the 2600 K though despite that
it is still a country mile behind the
8700 K with both CPU is overclocked for
2200 K was 22% slower for the average
frame rate and 28% slower after the
minimum frame rate overclocked the 2600
K was able to pull the head of the 4770k
and although much taller than the
overclocked daddy seminar ok
looked pretty solid overall now this is
peculiar the overclocked 2600 K for the
first time
testing is able to roughly match the
overclocked 4770k honestly I was
expecting to see a lot more of this but
for whatever reason the overclocked 2600
K has struggled to keep pace with the
fourth-generation 4770k the trend
continues with the ultra quality
settings and here the overclocked 2600
hay is just 16 percent slower nearly 700
K or 20% slower if we look at the 1%
data however jumping up to 1440p almost
neutralizes the playing field entirely
and now the overclocked 2600 K is less
than 10% styled now it is 700 K the 2600
K also enjoyed a solid 22% performance
boost from the overclock with Rainbow
six siege the 2600 K is back to getting
absolutely pummeled at high frame rates
despite an almost 20% increase in
performance once overclocked it was
still slightly slower than the stock
4770k and as a result the overclocked
2600 K was 31% slower than the
overclocked 8700 K the margin is reduced
to 26% with the high-quality preset
enabled but even so the 2600 K is really
showing its age in this title of course
it did maintain well over 100 FPS at all
times but in relation to the newer CPUs
tested it looked pretty slow as we
increase the GPU load the margins
continue to close and now the 2600 K is
just 17 percent slower nearly 700 K when
comparing the average frame rate
although it was 22% slower for the
minimum frame rate those gaming at 1440p
will notice less of a difference between
the various CPUs tested that said
despite just 6% separating them for the
average frame rate the overclocked 2600
K was still 18% slower than 87 okay
we're looking at the 1% low results
moving on to this second last game
tested total war Warhammer - we again
finally stopped 2600 K really struggling
at least when compared to the modern
CPUs dipping down to 100 FPS mapped the
2600 K was 37% solid 87 ok
that said though ever clocking really
does help the old Sandy Bridge processor
boosting the minimum frame rate by 27%
making it 20% slower than 87 or hey once
again though we see that the 87 RK is
limited by the GTX 1080 TI I had
expected the higher quality preset to
reduce the margin between the 2600 K and
the 87 okay but it's
done the opposite stop the 2600 K is now
39 percent slower and one overclocked it
still trailed the GPU limited 87 okay by
a twenty nine percent margin these
margins can be seen we're looking at the
one percent low data quite shockingly
even the ultra quality settings don't
allow the 2600 K to catch up and here
it's much slower than expected and say
there has to be some kind of design or
platform limitation here bumping the
resolution up to 1440p we finally see
the margin close up but even so the
overclocked 2,600 K is nowhere near we'd
expect it to be still trailing every
other CPU tested by an 8% margin the
4770k also uses ddr3 memory albeit
higher clock 2400 stuff but still while
that might aid the margin we're seeing
it really has to be down to IPC
improvements wrapping things that we
have the Call of Duty World War two
results and as usual we'll start with
the medium or in this case normal
quality settings here the overclock 2600
K is able to edge out the 4770k albeit
by slim margin meanwhile we compared to
the 87 arcades the overclocked 2700 K
was 28% slower when comparing the 1%
data again we find that when increasing
the quality settings this time in our
high the margin actually increases the
overclocked 2600 K is now 33 percent
slower than the overclocked 87 or gate
when comparing the 1 percent low data
the margin remains much the same even
with the extra quality settings enabled
here the overclocked 2600 K was 32
percent slower than the 87 ok even at
1440p we again to see similar margins
and here the overclocked 2600 K was 33%
slower than the 8700 K so for those
seeking maximum frame rates in this
fast-paced first-person shooter you're
not gonna want a Sandy Bridge processor
okay so if you've made it this far
well done I'll get some t-shirts made up
saying something like I survived 968
benchmark results and if you only just
made it well prepare to brace yourself
because I've got two more graphs showing
the average performance across the 11
games tested so let's check that out
before wrapping things up across the 11
games test and if we look at the data
from the lowest quality presets tested
at 1080p
this is what we find
they're overclocked 2,600 k was 27%
slowly overclocked 87 okay when
comparing the average frame rate or I
suppose you could say the 87 or okay was
37% faster this is true for both the
average frame rate and one percent low
result
on average the overclocked 2600 K was
also only able to match the stock 4770k
and was therefore beaten by the stock
7600 okay
that said though in games such as
battlefield 1 the 2600 case still
provided a much better experience when
compared to the quad core Core i5
processor for those gaming at what's
probably a more realistic resolution the
overclocked 2600 okay was just 17
percent slower than the 87 okay when
comparing the 1 percent low results and
that's still a pretty big margin to be
honest especially given how heavily
limited the 8700 K was in most of the
games the 2600 K was 10 percent so when
comparing the average frame repet really
it's those 1 percent low results that
gamers will notice the most right so if
you're a core i7 2618 er what does this
mean for you well currently probably not
a lot
if you're running a graphics card that's
equal to or slower than a GTX 1074 now
you really don't need to do anything
assuming that you've overclocked that
sucker to at least 4 point 5 gigahertz
at the stock clock speeds the 2600 K
will often limit performance of a gtx
1070 or vega 56 graphics card so be
aware of that and with the gtx 1060 or
an RX 580 for example you'll have no
such problem overclocked to the 2600 k
averaged a hundred and forty FPS in
battlefield one a gtx 1070 well it's
good for around a hundred and fifteen
FPS with an 8700 K so for the most part
you should be okay there
Call of Duty World War 2 it's a little
closer there the gtx 1070 that's good
for a hundred and thirty three FPS on
average with the 8700 k the overclocked
2600 k while that man is just 134 FPS
with the 1080 TI so you certainly on the
edge there with a 2600 K and a 1070
combo if you are playing the latest and
greatest tiles on an overclocked 2600 K
with the GTX 1080 or better then without
question the little old CPU it is
restricting performance quite a bit
there
of course the 2600 K is now a
seven-year-old CPU so the fact that it's
holding up high-performance GPUs in 2017
probably shouldn't be that surprising I
think it's fair to say that Sandy Bridge
has fared well over the years now
certainly better than any other CPU
architecture we've seen before or at
least any of that I can recall but we're
now at the end of the road the next
generation of GPUs will likely see
budget mid-range models finding the
limits of the 2600 K and at that point
it will certainly be worth upgrading
still if you're serious about your games
and you play titles such as battlefield
1a Call of Duty World War 2 then I
strongly suggest you look at upgrading
to an eighth gen core processor or maybe
2017 s best value option the horizon 5
1600 speaking of which in the next
update I'll finally add some rise in
CPUs to these results and on that note
I'm going to end this one and get back
to some benchmarking I'm your host Steve
