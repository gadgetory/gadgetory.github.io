finally taking a look at a monitor that
loads of you guys have been wanting me
to test for quite some time the sous rog
swift PG 27 UQ for those that aren't
familiar this is the first g-sync hgl
monitor on the market sporting top-end
specs like a 4k 144 it's IPS panel with
the thousands of peak brightness and 384
zone backlighting it's basically the
highest end monitor you can get right
now with proper support for HDR and
never-before-seen refresh rate
capabilities at this resolution it's
also the most expensive monitor you can
get right now outside of high-end
professional monitors certainly the most
expensive gaming class monitor in the US
you'll need to fork out $2000 for this
beast in in Australia we're faced with a
price tag of $3500 redos this makes it
roughly twice as expensive as the next
most expensive gaming monitor so you
really wanted to take every possible box
and last for many many years without
needing an upgrade there's many
different aspects of this monitor to go
through in the performance section but
let's first take a look at the design
because this isn't your typical 27-inch
gaming monitor yes we're getting all the
usual a sooth gamer style garbage like
RGB LEDs on the back projector light
under the stand plenty of interesting
patterns and design elements in a
typical a soos rog color scheme it's not
a minimalist or stealthy design
whatsoever in fact it's very obvious
this thing is designed for gamers much
to my annoyance but it doesn't tick
every box in the modern gamer display
checklist it's not curved which
personally I prefer for 16:9 monitors
and particularly for those of this size
I don't think having a curved panel adds
anything to the experience of 27 inches
so that's a positive
also the bezels are quite large it's 17
to 22 millimeters and the display
overall is a bit of a chunky beast in
fact it's just as fat as some curved
monitors without being curved at all not
of this really matters it's also the
first monitor I've ever reviewed that
requires active cooling a vent just in
front of the display inputs on the rear
pumps out hot air through a slow
spinning but audible fan the fan is
needed to cool the new g-sync HDR module
which is essentially an expensive
reasonably powerful FPGA
the module obviously dumps out quite a
bit more heat compared to the old g-sync
module so the fan is required in a quiet
room the fan is very obvious it's
definitely not loud but the hum is
audible above my PCs fans while idling
so silent PC enthusiasts will hate it
especially considering basically every
other monitor in existence does not
require active cooling the fan does stop
eventually after being in an idle state
and off for a long time but you think
the process could be a bit quicker
particularly as the monitor uses 27
watts while in idles displaying nothing
before going into a deep sleep moving on
we get to the usual inputs reducing
Camano DisplayPort 1.4 an HDMI 2.0 along
with the two port USB 3.0 hub and a 3.5
million a only DisplayPort supports the
full refresh rate HDMI is limited to 60
Hertz and does not support g-sync
distend it's sturdy and supports a great
range of motion including tilt height
adjust swivel and pivot so you can use
the monitor in a portrait orientation if
you desire only the legs are fully
constructed from mineral the rest of the
monitor including the stand pillar is a
rather unimpressive plastic especially
for a $2000 product the build quality
isn't bad you know there are no visual
defects or misaligned elements but a
more premium finish would have been
appreciated at this sort of price the
on-screen display does use the
directional toggle though which is a
necessary inclusion when you pack in as
many features as a su stars you won't
find if the unusual in the OSD Oliver
soos as usual cheat crosshairs low blue
light modes and different gaming modes
have made the cut there are also some
HDR specific features like backlight
modes as I'll talk about later while UL
mb or ultra low motion blur is missing a
beech are normally found on high-end
g-sync monitors to improve clarity
through backlight strobing my guess is
you LMB is incompatible with the new
g-sync module and i doubt many people
would choose to use it over to sync with
XJ anyway so I guess it's not a big loss
moving on to performance which I'm sure
a lot of you will be interested in
there's quite a lot to say here
considering there are so many features
packed in let's tackle HDR first before
moving on to color performance and
response times I've already made a
separate video discussing what features
are required for a good HDI experience I
made a checklist for assessing Hg are
compatible monitors so if the interest
in what specs are necessary for a good
hgr monitor and why you should check out
that video but let's see how the PG 27
uq stacks up in the checklist looking at
brightness support we have 1000 nits of
peak brightness and 600 Nissa stain
brightness which is well above what is
required
I measured full white sustain brightness
of 634 nits which is absolutely i
scorching in regular viewing conditions
and that gradually increases to nearly
700 nits for a 25% window and 900 nits
for a 10% window or smaller I achieved
an impressive sustained brightness of
933 nits for a 2% window with flashes
pushing well over 1000 100 nits meeting
a Seuss's specification claims the
display can also produce a full white
image for around 1 second at 1000 nits
which basically requires sunglasses to
view it so bright for local dimming we
have a 384 zone full array back light so
at this monitor size each dimming zone
covers roughly 22 by 26 millimeters the
backlight is extremely responsive
adjusting its light output in under 10
milliseconds in worst case transitions
which is like a 1 frame delay at 98
Hertz as the backlight is also so
responsive there's no visible afterglow
when a bright object suddenly disappears
review and the zones are small enough
that HDR glow around bright elements is
minimal and not typically noticeable in
most near standard viewing conditions
like gaming or watching movies the only
time I notice the glow effect was when
the panel tried to show small white text
on otherwise completely black screen and
that's not something that happened often
in actual games the dynamic range
between a flickering fire and the
darkness of night was massive and that's
where the FA LD backlight really shines
in its ability to simultaneously display
1000 nits in some areas and just 0.02
nits in others the very high contrast
ratio this type of backlight provides
and brightness levels way above SDR
screens is the reason HDR looks
incredible when done properly and the PG
27 UQ is one such display that does hgl
well in terms of contrast ratio
measurements I achieved fifty three
thousand to one at peak
although that falls to thirty three
thousand to one when judging based on
the monitors sustained brightness output
when disabling the dynamic
backlight the monitor is just a typical
IPS in terms of contrast with the ratio
just about a thousand to one but really
I see no reason to disable the dynamic
backlight unless you are viewing
something where the Glo issue is very
noticeable for the vast majority of
users in the vast majority of content
you'll be viewing even in the SDR mode
leaving the FA LD zones active is the
way to go you can also adjust the speed
of the FA LD backlight just in case the
default fast mode is too fast for you
there might be some occasions where
rapid changes to backlight brightness
aren't ideal for the content you're
viewing in which case the slower modes
will be better for you however there
wasn't a single time where I felt the
fast mode was too fast especially while
gaming so again I don't think this is a
setting you'll want to change the final
things on the HDR checklist are color
space the PG 27 UQ supports 97 percent
DCI p3 coverage which is much wider than
srgb and of course there's the usual
stuff like 10 bit processing and an 8
bit plus FRC panel in my testing
actually achieved 93% DCI p3 coverage
but that's still pretty good and above
what is required for HDR I'm not going
to show color accuracy results for DCI
p3 because I've been informed by several
people that the testing tools I have
available to me aren't accurate enough
to test this type of monitor in wide
gamut some tools can do it but not what
I currently have or what is available in
our budget so I'm not going to show
inaccurate results and instead skip wide
government accuracy entirely however I
will mention there is a mode to use wide
gamut with SDR so content creators
working with DCI p3 in an app that
doesn't natively support HDR can still
make use of this monitors support for
that color space now it's probably a
good time for just some general thoughts
on HDR the PG 27 UQ is quite clearly the
best hgr monitor I've used the contrast
and brightness specs illustrating this
on paper but when you actually get to
using the monitor it's far and away
superior to a regular SDR monitor in
games that support HDR properly even SDR
content gets a handy boost from the FAL
d backlight because this LCD has a
contrast ratio
far higher than regular LCDs in the SDR
mode in games like Far Cry 5 that
support hgr really well you'll not only
get a more vibrant image as the panel
can actually display more colors but
there's so much more detail visible
particularly in high contrast scenes
take an outdoor sunny scene with heavy
shadowing for example this monitor has
the ability to dazzle you with the Sun
burning at a thousand hits while
simultaneously providing plenty of
visible detail in a dark shadowy area
neither of these elements have blown out
because the monitors dynamic range far
exceeds a regular SDR display and it
more closely simulates how the scene
would look in real life it won't come as
a surprise that it's very hard to
demonstrate on camera exactly how
different this monitor looks it's just
one of those things you have to view for
yourself to see the difference between
HDR and SDR but unlike several other
monitors with weak HDR support the PG 27
UQ gets it right and the result is a
fantastic xgr image that blows boring
old SDR away of course there is one
elephant in the room and that's the
issue with refresh rates and chroma
subsampling the PG 27 you can only
natively support full four four for RGB
sampling at 10 bit HDR at 4k at a
maximum refresh rate of 98 Hertz
it can also only support for four for
sampling of 8-bit SDR 4k content at 120
Hertz this is entirely down to
DisplayPort one point force bandwidth
there simply is not enough bandwidth to
display 4 4 4 10 bit 4k content at 144
Hertz don't blame a Seuss or a Optronics
for this one the technology just isn't
there right now
now you might recall this monitor is
actually a 144 Hertz panel so this
throws up a bit of an issue to achieve
144 Hertz through DisplayPort 1.4 a sues
has resorted to 4 to 2 chroma
subsampling for HDR content above ninety
eight Hertz and SDR content above 120
Hertz what for - to subsampling means is
you're getting full 4k luminance
resolution but chrominance resolution is
below 4k approximately 1440p for
simplicity's sake so for every group of
4 pixels you are getting 4 luma samples
and just 2 chroma samples this sounds
bad but luckily for humans the eye is
more sensitive to luminance than
chrominance so for general imagery
there's very little difference between 4
4 4 and 4 - 2 content in the games I
tested and videos I watched I honestly
could not tell the difference between
the two sampling
this isn't a shock really because
blu-rays and even UHD blu-ray is
actually use a more aggressive four to
zero sub sampling method and blu-ray
quality is of course fantastic for video
however for two to subsampling is
noticeable in desktop apps and also in
some very specific game menus if you
look quite closely anything with clearly
defined edges on solid backgrounds
particularly fine edges like text will
have edge artifacts with four to two
subsampling provided that edge has a
color component so black text on a white
background is not affected but blue text
on a green background for example is
heavily affected for two to subsampling
is a minor issue but it does result in a
noticeable quality loss for desktop
usage I'd advise running the panel at a
maximum of 120 Hertz in the SDR mode and
that's what I tested with later so you
don't run into subsampling while using
desktop apps while refresh rate you
should use for games is trickier HDR
gaming is limited to 98 Hertz without
subsampling in most cases your graphics
card probably isn't powerful enough to
run at above 4 km 98 fps I tested with
the Titan XP and 60fps is more around
the mark in modern games so if you're
not actually running above 98 FPS I
limit the monitor to 98 Hertz to avoid
subsampling just in case there is some
noticeable quality loss but
realistically you're not going to notice
any significant quality loss in games by
opting to run at 144 Hertz with
subsampling evening games that do have
menus with coloured texts and
backgrounds the font size is usually
large enough that the artifacts are
practically invisible unless you're
hunting for them so if you have the
power to play at 4k 144 FPS you can
still get a good experience running the
monitor at 144 Hertz with that extra bit
of smoothness compared to 98 Hertz of
course the subsampling issue isn't ideal
because you should be switching back to
120 or 98 Hertz for desktop usage and
ideally the full refresh range would be
accessible without a quality loss
however ie Optronics has developed a
panel capable of 4k 144 Hertz
before display interfaces could support
it properly so this compromise solution
is literally the best we've got right
now let's talk color performance in the
SDR mode here we're limited to three
hundreds of peak brightness and with the
dynamic backlight enabled you'll get a
contrast ratio
14600 two one and two hundred nits which
we use for calibration that's cut down
to just shy of ten thousand to one which
is still outstanding for LCD technology
there are some situations where content
creators may want to disable the dynamic
backlight in which case again you revert
to a standard 1000 to 1 contrast ratio
but for most users as I said earlier
just keep it on the page g27 yuku comes
factory calibrated to a delta e of a
less than 3.0 which isn't the tightest
standard but in my testing of default
performance color accuracy was
significantly better than Delta ease of
just 3.0 in general the monitor produced
a grayscale Delta e average of just one
point four three with a color
temperature average of 64 19k and
near-perfect gamma which is a fantastic
out-of-the-box result saturation results
revealed a delta e average of one point
six zero with 99.9 percent srgb coverage
while in color checker Delta ears were
entirely under 3.0 with an average of
one point five eight all up this is
excellent factory performance from a
monitor with performance near
indistinguishable from true accuracy the
most strict users may want to calibrate
it further to get Delta YZ sub 1.0 but
anything on a 2.0 is basically accurate
anyway so I probably wouldn't bother
attempting to deal with often
troublesome color profiles just to get a
very minor improvement that said I do
calibrate the monitor fully using a
combination of color profile and minor
OSD tweaks and achieved average Delta is
around 1.0 or lower with a tighter gamma
and CCT curve the hinter contrast was
basically irrelevant as well do note
that color profiles are ignored in
Windows HDR mode but the good news is
the factory SDR performance is preserved
when HDR and WCG is enabled to Windows
support for SDR tone mapping in the HDR
mode is improving with each update to
the point where leaving the setting
enabled for desktop users is now a
genuine option panel uniformly it was
good without being great the top left
and bottom right areas are slightly off
compared to the rest of the panel in my
review unit but overall uniformity is a
bit better than most gaming displays
however it's not in the same ballpark as
professional-grade monitors so while the
soo's is providing very good color
accuracy for professionals out of the
box there is still merit to purchasing a
top-end Pro monitor to get extreme
uniformity
for response time testing I tested with
the dynamic backlight enabled as I
recommend most people leave it enabled
for gaming this actually improves
response times by 1 to 2 milliseconds to
my surprise I'd also recommend leaving
the monitor on its default normal
overdrive setting the extreme mode
introduces overshoot so my testing was
done with the normal setting the PG 27
UQ uses IPS technology so naturally it
will sit between TN and VA in terms of
response times a soos quotes a greater
great figure of 4 milliseconds and
surprisingly I reported a four point one
eight millisecond greater great average
which is very good for this sort of
monitor fall times are slightly longer
than rise times on average but there
were no crazily slow outliers the black
white black response of 9.5 6
milliseconds is also in line with the
Seuss's quoted specs so no complaints
here input lag is slightly down on other
monitors I've tested though it's not
outrageous in just the SDR mode with the
dynamic backlight and gsync enabled at
120 Hertz estimated lag is around 15
milliseconds which is similar to the s8
a Predator X 34 as I test more monitors
will have a wider range of data to
compare with that input lag testing
methodology so stay tuned and a quick
note on power consumption the PG 27 UQ
sucks down a huge a hundred and
seventeen watts displaying a 200 nits or
white image which is well above other 27
inch monitors I've tested a typical
power consumption figure for this size
and resolution should be around 60 watts
but with the backlight and gsync module
and the higher refresh rate that's
ballooned out significantly as for peak
power consumption this beast sucks down
300 watts to display a full white image
at 1000 nits after all this testing it's
time to go over at all and give my final
thoughts on this monitor there's no
doubting it's a very impressive piece of
hardware with excellent performance in
both HDR and SDR modes it's great to see
who's providing factory calibration for
the monitor which you'd pretty much
expect at this price point but it's the
HDR support and specifically good HDR
support that elevates it to the next
level features like 1000 nits of peak
brightness the high zone count local
dimming backlight and wide color gamut
support hit the three key pillars of HDR
provide an excellent viewing experience
the PG 27 UQ looks much better than any
SDR monitor in games that properly
support HDR and there's not just a minor
improvement the difference in visual
quality is significant from a number of
perspectives it's truly the best and
highest quality experience you'll get
from a gaming monitor in 2018 however
there are many things to consider before
going out and buying a PG 27 UQ for
starters it's $2,000 which is ludicrous
money to spend on a gaming monitor you
can get really good 27-inch 1440p 144
hertz g-sync monitors for $500 these
days which may not be as high resolution
or support HDR but you're going to get a
great game experience at that price is
the bump to 4k with HDR support really
worth an extra $1,500 the PG 27 you tube
is very good but it's impossible to
justify that price difference the PG
tween 7uq also suffers from being a
first generation product Nvidia g-sync
HDR module is by all reports expensive
to produce in its current form and the
panel is also the first of its kind
combine those two things and suddenly
the price of the monitor has skyrocketed
issues like the active cooling fan
larger bezels and chroma subsampling are
all also symptoms of first gen tech that
does work well and achieves its
advertised goals admittedly but with
compromises and teething issues that
will no doubt be ironed out in the next
iteration it's not unusual for early
adopters to have to put up with high
prices and a few oddities but it's
compounded by the lack of games that
properly support HDR on PC you're not
only spending a lot of money to get HDR
today but you're also limited to a small
handful of titles that make the most of
this monitors top head features as good
as I think the PG 27 UQ is I honestly
think the best move is to wait I'd be
mighty disappointed spending $2,000 on
this monitor right now only to find out
that in a year the tech is available for
half that price with way more games that
support it and a few of those issues
ironed out after all this is a massive
investment and for $2,000 I want to be
sure I was getting not just the best
monitor available today but a near
perfect long-lasting product that won't
be superseded quickly that's not to say
all PG 20
7uq buyers will be disappointed it's an
outstanding monitor today and perfectly
complements high-end pcs but there are a
lot of things to consider before forking
over that sort of cash for a first gen
product and if I had that sort of money
to spend on a monitor myself I'd be
holding off for now until the hgr
monitor ecosystem is a bit more mature
