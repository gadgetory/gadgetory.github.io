we're asking the question did intel
cherry-pick the core i7 8,700 cable
review samples some people certainly
seem to think so I however have
absolutely no idea what I do know is
that my review sample is a beast
it hits a stable 5 point 2 year it's
using just one point three six volts and
apparently that places it in the top
twenty two percent of all the 8700 cage
ships deleted and tested by Silicon
lottery actually it might even be better
than that because they spec they're 5.2
gigahertz delivered chips at one point
four to five volts with an AV X offset
of -2 my CPU is achieving that overclock
with fireless voltage and no adjustments
the AV x offset and no D lead I did
however have to ditch my 240 millimeter
all-in-one liquid cooler and go for a
custom loop all the temperatures gone up
over 90 degrees but no one ever said the
8700 K was cool my personal experience
playing around the 8700 K doesn't
actually end with a single sample
provided by Intel a motherboard
manufacturer asrock provided me with a
qualification sample or QoS chip and it
requires one point four to five volts to
achieve stability at five point two
gigahertz but it will do five point one
gigahertz at a much lower voltage so
that certainly makes the chip provided
by Intel better not world's better but
it is clearly better I've also played
around with a few retail 8700 K
processors that I've picked up for
builds for friends and none of them are
falling short of five point one
gigahertz two out of the three actually
did reach five point two gigahertz I
don't recall the voltages but I know
they did it it's a small sample size
I'll admit which is why I've made no
bold claims other than to say that my
experience so far with retail chips has
been very similar to my sample provided
by Intel but perhaps I've been extremely
lucky it is worth noting that some other
media outlets such as gamers Nexus PC
labs in Hardware far all got 8700 K
samples from Intel didn't overclock
worth a damn so that fact alone kind of
pokes a hole in the whole conspiracy
thing that the review samples are chair
it is a bit hard to turn a blind eye to
that fact if you want to remain
objective still it's a very interesting
discussion and one well worth having
certainly a great topic to bring up but
for me though it does go a bit beyond
cherry-picked samples are proving what's
going on there's really going to be
extremely difficult and well it is
called the silicon lottery for a reason
and I'm not talking about the Texan
based company when a reviewer says a cpu
model such as the 8700 K is a good
overclocker
they don't mean you're going to get the
exact same overclock they did and
nothing's guaranteed of course
especially when it comes to overclocking
but it should mean that your chances of
achieving that overclock or something
very similar is quite good but of course
you should also prepare yourself for the
possibility of getting a lemon but what
I really want to know is what are your
chances of getting a lemon I've bought
three and one the silicon lottery each
time those purchases were spread out
over a four to five month period but
what if you walked into your local PC
part store and bought say ten retail
8700 K processors and overclocked them
all to find out that's exactly what I've
done well almost done I've borrowed ten
retail 8700 K processors from PC case ki
who were gracious enough to go along
with this idea please note though this
video doesn't feature any testing and
there will be extensive testing in a
follow-up video on the channel this time
tomorrow the point of this video is to
allow us to skip everything we've just
discussed so tomorrow we can just get
right into the results I also just
wanted to take this chance to provide
some evidence I suppose I need to do
that but we have 10 a brand new sealed
8700 k retail chips so unaltered
untampered untested they've just been
while somewhat randomly selected and
we've got two cartons of them as you can
see here and I personally really don't
care what the outcome is I don't care
what these chips do I'm just interested
to find out what they actually do and
let you guys know I'm genuinely curious
and I'm really excited to have the
opportunity and I really can't thank PC
case Kea enough for giving me the
opportunity right now I have absolutely
no idea what these CPUs do I haven't
taken them out of the box yet but
this video will be delayed so you'll be
seeing it probably about a week after it
actually takes place so that allows me
to film this part and then film part two
after I've done all my testing which
will take at least a couple of days to
test all these properly and create part
two but as you can see if I can get one
of them out they're packed in quite
densely actually I open this as well
okay well that is a beautiful thing okay
so that is what we are faced with a
whole heap of core i7 8700 k boxes and
at quick glance here it looks like we've
got at least two different batch numbers
I'll just - in there so as you can see
they are all completely sealed brand new
boxes the factory sealed labels on all
of them these have all been provided by
piece PCK secure no funny business
what's so heavy going on and yeah we
have ten core i7 8700 k CPUs I'm
probably going to put one of these
upside down today so I plan to test all
ten of these CPUs and their stock out of
the box configuration so just put them
on the motherboard with the default BIOS
settings and I'll compare performance
power drawer operating temperatures
voltages all that stuff and then of
course we will find the maximum over
stable overclock for each one of these
chips and then I'll report back all that
data again that I just mentioned
temperatures power draw performance all
that stuff and we'll see what they can
do PC case key tells me they buy these
CPUs and cartons of five and well we
just saw two of the cartons and they
told me they have plenty of cartons in
stock and buy plenty they mean hundreds
of 8700 K CPUs that said although they
have plenty in stock I'm still extremely
grateful that they have supported us
with a No
strings attached really they just said
here's the CPUs do the video you want to
do have some fun so a huge thanks to the
guys at PC case key and if you do want
to buy an 8700 K well then jump over to
their website I'll put a link in the
video description I know they've got
plenty in stock anyway that is going to
do it for part 1
as I said tomorrow's video will feature
all the test results so that will no
doubt be very very interesting and I
make sure that you don't miss tomorrow's
video subscribe to the channel and be
sure to have the notification belts
selected that way hopefully YouTube will
notify you when the video goes live
thanks for watching I'm your host Steve
singing tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
