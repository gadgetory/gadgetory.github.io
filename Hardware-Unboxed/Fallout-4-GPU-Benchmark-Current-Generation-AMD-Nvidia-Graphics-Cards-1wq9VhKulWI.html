I'm your host Matt and today I'm gonna
be taking a look at how the current
generation AMD and NVIDIA graphics cards
tackle Bethesda's highly anticipated
fallout 4
finally fallout 4 is here and fans of
the series can begin to roam the big
open post-apocalyptic world navigating
their way around all through the
labyrinth of bloke flyers blood bugs
Raiders and all other kinds of nasty
stuff but before you're ready to throw
yourself into the nuclear fallout a
quick look at the recommended system
specs is advised the developers put
forth some rather demanding hardware
requirements especially for the ultra
quality settings
assuming you're anything like me you
want to enjoy fallout 4 and all of its
glory and that means cranking the visual
settings right up to the max for this
Bethesda recommends either a core i7
4790k or FX 95 90 along with a geforce
gtx 780 or radeon r9 290x jacks for
those of you considering upgrading to a
current gen mid-range to high-end
graphics card for fallout 4 we've run
some benchmarks to show you what kind of
performance you can expect the minimum
and average frame rate was recorded
using fraps at the popular 1080p
resolution as well as 1440p and 4k the
maximum in-game quality settings were
used in each resolution and we selected
the temporal anti-aliasing mode
otherwise known as taa one thing that
does kind of suck about the game is the
60 FPS cap thankfully it can be manually
switched off in a config file in my
games folder for more information on how
to do this please check the video
description below
benchmarking takes place in the
Commonwealth the pre-war American state
of Massachusetts in New England the
benchmark pass runs for 90 seconds and
here's a recording of that very pass we
set the difficulty to very easy to avoid
being killed by the Raiders and we took
the same path each time the results have
been taken from an average of three runs
finally for a full list of the system
specs and software use please refer to
the video description below
fallout 4 was very playable at 1080p
with the GTX 960 which happened to be 11
percent faster than the Radeon r9 380
not something we often find still with
an average of 56 frames per second and
never dipping below the 46 FPS mark the
3ds still provided a very solid gaming
experience especially when keeping in
mind the quality settings we were using
the sweet spot for optimal performance
would have to be the r9 390 and GTX 970
both of which managed to keep the
framerate above 60 FPS at all times
moving up to 1440p we see that the gtx
960 and r9 380 really struggle and the
gameplay was noticeably choppy the gtx
970 and r9 390 provided smooth game
players neither drop below the 40 FPS
mark and had an average of 56 frames per
second the 390x wasn't noticeably faster
than 390 and both dip down to the same
minimum frame rate at the 1440p
resolution an argument could be made
that the GTX 980 is the best value
graphics card as it sits between the
fury and the fury X in terms of
performance the 980ti was shockingly
fast with an average of 89 fps and a
minimum of 81 fps making it 35 % faster
than the standard gtx 980 those who want
to play a 4k with all the eye-candy
turned up will need a 980 TI and even
then we still feel like sli is called
for as is often the case of the latest
triple-a titles 4k gaming will require
the use of two or more GPUs visually
fallout 4 isn't ridiculously impressive
the texture quality and graphical
details certainly isn't mind-blowing
when compared to other recently released
games such as The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt or
battlefield hardline that said it is
important to remember that fallout 4 is
an open
game with truly massive environments a
lot of variety and when turned all the
way up the view distances are truly
spectacular on that note if you're
looking to gain a little extra
performance and for that fall we found
one of the biggest performance boosters
was to reduce the view and shadow
distance to the medium value this alone
should net you around 20% more
performance depending on the setup
unlike black ops 3 we found that fallout
4 wasn't a memory pig and gamers with 8
gig of ram or more would be more than
comfortable in fact we didn't see a
performance head or any stuttering even
when using just 4 gigabytes of RAM but
1080p gaming with everything turned up
the GTX 960 is the best budget option
while the GTX 970 will deliver the best
experience that said the r9 390 provided
almost the same result as the GTX 970 so
either option will work well at 1080p
the performance hit scene when moving up
to 1440 Pierre was quite large and we
recommend the GeForce GTX 980 here for
optimal performance the Radeon r9 390 or
GeForce GTX 970 will work quite nicely
as well although fallout 4 doesn't
feature cutting edge visuals those
massive draw distances mean that the 4k
resolution demands some serious
firepower
the 980ti works quite well though a pair
of gtx 980 is all fury graphics cards
would be required for a completely lag
free experience overall fallout 4 looks
like a heap of fun and I can't wait to
explore more of the open world as always
we'll be posting these graphs in a text
summary up to f4 my Hardware on box comm
