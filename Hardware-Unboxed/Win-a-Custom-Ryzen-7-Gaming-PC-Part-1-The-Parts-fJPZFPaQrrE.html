you can tell I am very excited more so
than usual and is because i have a heap
of very cool pc hardware here and with
that i plan to build an amazing gaming
system and the best bit is one lucky
viewer will be able to call their own
very soon thermaltake has been extremely
generous by not only providing the cool
hardware that you see here for the build
but they're also responsible for
organizing pretty much the whole
giveaway by calling on their partners
msi kingston an AMD to get involved in
this video i'm more or less just showing
off the hardware i have to build the
horizon 7 giveaway pc so consider this a
bit of a teaser and the next day or so i
will complete the build show it off to
you guys and run a few benchmarks now if
you were to go out and buy all this
hardware to build your own pc you'd be
looking at spending roughly two thousand
two hundred dollars us or 3,300 hace so
this is pono means a low budget build at
the core of the build we have the
incredible msi x3 70 x power gaming
titanium motherboard and this thing
comes with all the bells and whistles
you get to em two slots audio boost for
with amplifier USB 3.1 gen2 into land
and much more this really is the
pinnacle of am for motherboards
complimenting the extreme MSI
motherboard is the flagship verizon 1800
x which will be liquid cools for maximum
impact what more needs to be said really
the 1800 x is a beast when it comes to
productivity and is more than capable
when it comes to gaming speaking of
damning we have the msar x 480 gaming x
80 on hand which is plenty fast enough
for 1080p or even 1440p gaming we
decided against liquid cooling this
component as it will allow the winner to
more easily upgrade the graphics card
down the track for storage we have the
kingston savage 240 gigabyte SSD which
will work nicely as a boot drive and
I'll pre install Windows 10 on this for
the winner use a look at the drive so
yeah very nice drive big enough for a
boot drive and they'll be plenty of room
in this system for secondary three and a
half inch hard drives for dish
no storage I assume that whoever's
winning this system probably already has
a computer and has a bit of their own
well has their own storage so they can
add that into the new system very easily
also Kingston has sent along their
hyperx savage ddr4 memory and we have
two black modules I believe it's ddr4
3000 stuff and yeah that's going to look
good in the system and unleash the
performance of the horizon processor now
for the case since this is a global
giveaway and the system could be sent
quite some distance we decided against
going for a fridge size piece so you
like the impressive at the tower 900
instead we've gone with a much more
compact yet equally impressive view
31like the tower 900 which is this big
fella here the view 31 utilizes tempered
glass in favor of our croelick windows
and really that is great news anyone
who's bought a taste with our critic
knows that pretty much out of the box it
looks fantastic you take the plastic off
when it's all nice and shiny and the
second you get some fingerprints and
whatnot on there and you have to wipe it
off its cuffs quite easily you also get
scratches and it really just the tracks
from the cool effect of being out of
senior computer and look at all that
fancy hardware another cool thing about
the view 37 is it is only a mid tower
case though it is very spacious because
I don't know how well you guys can see
this but it's 250 millimeters wide and
typically cases the wider ones are
around two hundred and twenty
millimeters so that extra 30 mil
provides a lot of extra space for cable
management stuff like that so I have no
excuse when it comes to the cables on
the back side of the case which you can
see through that tempered glass panel so
I'll have to have that all nice and neat
and thermaltake app center along their
modest leave cables anyway so they'll
look on the front side but I'll have to
tuck away all the power supply cables on
the back side but I'm confident we can
make that look pretty cool all up this
case tips the scales at ten point four
seven kilos which is quite heavy for
what is a relatively small mid tower but
keep in mind it does have a pair of four
millimeter thick tempered glass panels
and they do add a lot of weight to the
package the model thermal taker supplied
comes with two LED fans pre and
still though the blue models and as cool
as they are we will actually be ditching
them thermaltake us-supplied over two
hundred dollars worth of fans for this
build by sending along two packs of
their awesome looking ring plus RGB fans
so in total we have half a dozen
120-millimeter fans to play with in case
the six RGB fans weren't going to be
flashy enough thermal tankers also set
along their lumi color to 56 c RGB light
strip kit these magnetic LED strips look
amazing and I use them in my the towel
100 build which you usually see to my
right in most of the videos powering
everything is the tough power grand RGB
850 watt gold certified fully modular
power supply so we have more than enough
power for this build and the winner will
have room to expand down the track now
for cooling thermaltake has supplied
then you w for RGB water block to cool
the rise in CPU we also have the pacific
RL 360 radiator PR 22 dr pump and
reservoir samar gb hard tube fittings
and a heap of compression fittings all
in black the bill will be drained and
shipped to the winner dry the package
will include two bottles of c1000 liquid
in red to top it back up so an
incredible amount of hardware is going
into this build and I'm very proud that
was less than 100,000 subscribers we've
been able to offer such a fantastic
complete build again a big thank you to
thermaltake and their partners without
them I simply couldn't have done this no
less made it a global giveaway well
that's all for now I hope you guys are
as excited about this upcoming build as
I am speaking of which I better go get
cracking I do anticipate a late night
tonight but i'm pretty sure it's going
to be worth it thanks for watching I'm
your host Steve and stay tuned because
you are not going to want to miss part
to see you guys
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
