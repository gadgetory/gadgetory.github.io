ago MSI and gigabyte mailed over there
refresh x2 900 motherboards design take
advantage of the sky like X refresh
I suppose although the hype around that
series died down faster than a modern
triple-a title anyway quite some time
ago now I got the MSI Meg X $2.99
creation this rather big heavy
motherboard here I got that along with
where is it it's this one here
the gigabyte X $2.99 horas master and
that's also a big heavy motherboard
anyway I got these i unbox them in our
unboxing boxes series and at the time a
good many of you requested that I do
some vrm testing and well me being the
excellent host that I am it only took
around 4 months to make it happen anyway
in the meantime a soos also sent over
their new X 299 refresh board the X 299
deluxe 2 so I've added that to our three
wave erm thermal test battle yeah that
can be the the title of the video
anyway let's check the boards out shall
we the new msi Meg X 299 Croatian is the
most expensive x-29 motherboard to be
featured in this video
priced at $600 u.s. it is mighty
expensive and it's certainly the most
pricey x 299 bought msi offers that said
gigabyte and a sous do have more
expensive models but we won't be looking
at those in this video we'll get to
those boards in a moment I did introduce
them already but yeah they do have more
expensive motherboards this isn't the
most extreme most expensive X 299
motherboard out there but it's certainly
one of the most extreme for now let's
just quickly go over what the creation
has to offer
included on board is a beefy 13 plus one
phase VRM though please note it's a 12
phase of vcore vrm also included is 2.5
Gigabit Ethernet along with a gigabit
port plenty of USB 2.0 ports Wi-Fi
module four PCI a x 16 slots 3 m dot 2
slots with cooling plus an expander card
support
4m2 drives and a thunderbolt card
providing Thunderbolt 3 40 gigabits per
second ports that provide up to
DisplayPort 1.2 so in terms of features
it's pretty well got everything but for
those of you throwing in an 18 core core
i9 79 80 HZ or 99 ATX see how well does
the verum handle overclocking and does
it keep its cool under heavy load on
paper things look good it features an IR
3 5 2 0 1 phase controller and from that
six signals are output it to
half-a-dozen
ir35 9 9 phase SS creating a 12 phase
VRM MSI's use TD a21 for 7 to power
stages and these are the same 70 amp
parts that they featured on the
impressive x3 19 own creation though
they're a 16 phase V core verum
configuration was used cooling the power
stages is a very modest looking black
anodized heatsink which is connected
using a 6 millimeter heat pipe to an
equally modest looking anodized black
heatsink nothing particularly fancy here
and there's no kind of active cooling
present so it will be interesting to see
how well the crashing fares in the
thermal testing their sous prime X 299
deluxe is currently retailing for $500
u.s. and that makes it $100 cheaper than
the msi creation though there are some
noteworthy differences between those two
boards before we get into that I should
just quickly point out this isn't the
most high-end or most premium X 219 our
motherboard that a sous offers that
would be the rog rampage 6 extreme Omega
and we recently looked at the X 399
version of that board and also had a
really long name that no one remembers
getting back to the prime X 299 deluxe
to a sous has managed to one-up msi by
including five gigabit ethernet along
with a gigabit port you also get a Wi-Fi
module plenty of USB 3.1 ports but just
2 m dot 2 ports as Zeus does sell an
expansion card separately but it cost
$90 so if you include that in the price
then the asustor msi boards effectively
have the same retail price still in the
package you do get a few cool add-ons
such as the fan extension card to this
little module allows you to connect and
control up to half a dozen case fans and
it also includes 3 RGB
and three thermal sensors so that's
pretty neat but let's talk about the vrm
a soos calls this their 12 plus 2 power
stage design but it's not a twelve phase
vcore rather it's a six phase using a
doubling of components but there's no
double as used and this is a pretty
common design thing from a soos now so
what we have here is an ASP one four
zero five pwm controller which we've
always suspected is a rebadged IR three
five two zero one
anyway as was the case with the MSI
board six signals are taken from the
controller however each signal isn't
then doubled instead it's hooked up
directly to a pair of ir35 five power
stages each rated at 60 amps so in total
there's still a dozen power stages but
whereas the msi board has 12 phases a
susur's only has six a soos believes
they are better off avoiding doubles as
they introduce the latency and higher
transient voltage drop but at the end of
the day all we really care about is how
hot the vrm gets when overclocking and
we'll explore that in a moment for now
let's look at the gigabyte X 299 Horus
master by far the cheapest of the three
boards is gigabytes X 299 or ass master
coming in at just $340 u.s. it's always
half the price of the MSI crashing yet
despite that it is a really massive
motherboard that's jam packed with
features onboard you get three m2 ports
with cooling four PCIe x 16 slots two
point five gigabit wired networking
along with a more standard gigabit port
Wi-Fi high quality audio and wealth all
this just goes on so in terms of board
features it does a good job of matching
the more expensive models from MSI and a
soos the board also looks great and
incorporates a heap of nice design
features such as a dual bias with a
socketed BIOS and then you get all the
connector armor stuff on your PCIe slots
the DIMM slots and the power connectors
you also get a full sized heat shield on
the backside of the board it's more of a
heat spreader than a heat shield
whatever but it does have thermal pads
to extract built-up hate on the
underside of the PCB the vcore vrm is
controlled by the is l69 one 3/8
controller and like msi honest ooze
gigabytes taking six signals for the
vehicle
Oshin but unlike a soos they have opted
to use ASL six six one seven phase
doublers to create 12 phases this time
we find ISL nine nine two to seven power
stages which are rated for 60 amps
helping to further reduce verum
operating temperatures is an active fan
that's hidden away under the i/o cover
gigabytes also used to proper fin heat
sinks and like the other two boards we
find the two heat sinks are connected
via a six millimeter heat pipe I have to
say while the heat sinks on the soos
board looked quite good I reckon
gigabytes heat sinks look as though
they'll work the best okay so it's time
to put the board's to the test and as
usual I'm going to use blender the load
results are reported after an hour-long
stress test of running our blender
workload non-stop and then the idle is
taken after a 10-minute cooldown period
to record temperatures I'm using a
digital thermometer with k-type
thermocouple x' I've placed multiple
sensors on the surface of multiple power
stages to measure the temperature across
the vrm and I'll be reporting the
highest value so this means I'm
measuring the temperature directly on
top of the component between it and the
thermal pad and not an internal
temperature which is bound to be a bit
higher still with all boards tested
under the exact same conditions this
will give us a clearer picture of how
the vrm temperatures compare okay so
first we have these stock 79 80 X 80
results inside the corsair 500 d test
case here all the board's performed very
well keeping verum temperatures well
below 70 degrees at least this was the
maximum recorded surface temperature of
the power stages the Sue's Prime
actually provided the best result at a
mere 53 degrees the creation was just 4
degrees hotter and then the Gigabyte
board was another 6 degrees hotter and
that was quite surprising I have to say
then placing k-type thermocouple x' on
the back side of the PCB below the power
stages it was again the gigabyte horas
master that recorded the highest
temperature again I was very surprised
by this particularly given it has that
massive backplate complete with thermal
pads okay so now we've overclocked the
79-80 XC to 4 point 5 gigahertz using
1.2 volts and i've adjusted the load
line calibration of each board so it
held this voltage throughout our testing
here we see some pretty drastic changes
from the stock results the msi creation
for example around 15 degrees hotter
hitting a peak of 72 degrees but it was
their sous x to 9
Deluxe two results that were the most
shocking here the boards varium
temperature increased by an incredible
43 degrees peaking at 96 degrees this
doesn't seem possible given what we saw
from the msi board but I'll get to that
in a moment for now let's talk about the
Auris master here we saw a 31 degree
rise in temperature from the overclock
and this resulted in a peak temperature
of 94 degrees it's not great but it is a
pass if only just now after initially
finding the asustor results a bit hard
to believe I went back and retested
resetting everything including the
thermal probes just started over a few
hours later I found the exact same
result a peak temperature in the high
90s it seems to me as though the
enormous current requirements of the
overclocked 79 80 Hz is pushing the su 6
phase very well out of its efficiency
window and as you can see this just
results in really high operating
temperatures and things aren't any
better on the underside of the PCB
either and interestingly we see no
change in temperature for the MSI board
meanwhile the Assuan gigabyte boards
were a little bit hotter the gigabyte
board is particularly surprising here as
I did find late last year that gigabyte
z3 90 motherboards with the large
thermal backplate really excelled in
this test but here the x2 9 horas master
appears to see no benefit from the
backplate so that's very disappointing
well there you have it the results
really do speak for themselves
that said there are a few things worth
keeping in mind while the MSI X 299
creation was by far the best performer
when it came to erm thermals and it was
even very easy to overclock with it's
worth keeping in mind that I was testing
with an 18 core 79-80 XC and all the
boards did past all our stress testing
and all that stuff without any stability
issues any crashing or really any issues
at all so what I'm trying to say is if
you don't plan on purchasing an $1,800
u.s. processor and something like the 10
core core I 998 20x for example for $900
more you seek then blowing $600 plus on
an X - 9 hour motherboard isn't exactly
required of course if you're intending
on overclocking any of the 14 16 or 18
core parts to the max then I do highly
recommend looking at the MSI X 299
creation there seuss prime X - 9
Deluxe didn't really impress me much
particularly for a 500 dollar
motherboard the feature set is decent
but in a few areas it does come up short
even compared to the much cheaper horas
master so I'm struggling to find a
reason to recommend it beyond the fact
that a soos does do an excellent job
with their BIOS for me the gigabyte x2 9
horas master really impressive just $340
u.s. it is hard to beat yes it does have
an active fan and the vrm components
aren't the best they're certainly not
bad they're just not the best but again
you're not paying top dollar either
overall the build quality and board
design was excellent the feature sets
impressive and it did handle the
overclocked 79 80 XE without showing any
signs of instability it just got a
little hot under the collar doing it
overall the msi Meg x99 creation it's a
beast and I really do highly recommend
this motherboard for anyone looking for
the ultimate ex $2.99 board although the
Asuza rog rampage seeks extreme omega
might also be worth checking out but i
i'd certainly pass on the the deluxe ii
board that i've moved over to the side
there then as an affordable sort of
all-rounder i suppose you really can't
go past the gigabyte x2 9 horas master
and that is going to do it for this one
