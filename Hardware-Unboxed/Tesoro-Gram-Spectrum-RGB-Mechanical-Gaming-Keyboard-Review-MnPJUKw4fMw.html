keyboard reviews but you know I love him
anyway today on hand I've got tesoros
quite unique Graham RGB mechanical
keyboard in white so obviously the first
thing you notice is the striking white
color of the keyboard and key caps when
you plug it in the lighting looks pretty
amazing as a result secondly for me I
noticed the key caps are quite different
they're low profile this is something I
haven't encountered on a mechanical
keyboard before let's take a quick tour
around the board before I go any further
though obviously it's all white up top
no matt white and their symbols are
transparent on the keys to let the light
shine through in the top right corner
we've got the tesora logo as well as
three standard indicators couple with
blue LEDs size-wise we're looking at 445
mil long by 136 deep and it's 24.5 mil
fig weighing in at a little over a kilo
the underside is simple and features two
large flick down legs that have rubber
coated tips for extra grip in harmony
with the low-profile keycaps the
keyboard itself is pretty minimal at the
back side you simply find the USB port
for connecting the 1.8 meters braided
white cable that also ends in a white
tip now as mentioned the lighting looks
pretty damn amazing shining through the
key symbols reflecting back off the all
white backplate you can quickly cycle
through different lighting effects too
by using the function key and the left
and right arrows the igp wave looks
particularly impressive if not a little
too distracting you can also light up
the gaming keys set a breathing effect a
reactive ripple effect as well as a kind
of splash effect that lights up the keys
around the one you pressed in two
different colors too now let's talk
about these switches to sorry call them
agile switches than their unique in that
the aim to offer a low profile form
factor without sacrificing tactile
feedback the switches are my keyboard of
blues even though the center itself is
transparent and they are of course meant
to replicate the feel of cherry MX blues
these do offer a clicking noise and
tactile feedback that does remind me the
MX blues but for me I didn't find them
all that great to use I think they found
a little stiffer than the real blues
then they also let out a reverberating
hollow rattling noise which primarily
came from the space bar this made the
normally delightful sound of typing away
and blue
is actually quite annoying if i'm honest
i also found myself making a lot of
mistakes typing as i got used to the
switches this happened less and less of
course but when i went back to normal
profile true cherries or razors green
switches and felt like being back at
home again i can't quite put my finger
on why but i'm sure it had a lot to do
with the fact that these and knock off
switches and I'm definitely not used to
low profile key caps aside from all that
the keyboards actually fairly well
equipped feature wise for keyboard that
I described as being minimal you've got
access to lots of additional functions
directly from the keyboard itself with
the function key in combination with the
f1 f5 Keys you can switch between
profiles f6 locks the Windows key and
then from f7f 12 you can control media
brightness can also be adjusted with up
and down on the arrow keys on top of the
customization available purely on the
keyboard itself you can take things to
the next level with two Sora's
accompanying software here you can
create your own custom macros profiles
and perky lighting settings it's kept
nice and simple and there's not too much
to it thankfully two there's onboard
memory on the keyboard as well so you
don't need to run the software to access
your custom settings something sorely
missed from keyboards such as logitech
c910 all in all the tesora gram RGB is a
very striking keyboard especially in all
while the RGB is going crazy I wasn't a
huge fan of the key switches and feel of
typing on it but this is definitely a
personal preference thing and some
people will love it by the time I've
gotten used to it my error rate was back
down to only a little higher than normal
all the important features are on there
including n key roll over on board
memory in the life but if you demand a
wrist rest and USB passthrough then
you'll be left wanting I struggled to
find the Graham RGB available in
Australia but you can pick it up in the
USA starting at 119 dollars and you get
for different switch colors to choose
from what did you guys think the Graham
RGB let me know in the comments i'm your
host Matt and i'll see you guys next
time cheers guys for joining me for
