once again comparing new geforce gtx
1650 against the Radeon rx 570 and I
know I know I'm kind of flogging a dead
horse at this point but this testing is
going to be quite a bit different to the
testing I've done previously now because
these are lower end graphics cards they
sell for between 100 $150 so that's kind
of yeah that's sort of entry level issue
anyway because of that I test them at
1080p and I've done so previously using
high to ultra quality type settings in
fact the only games that I haven't
completely maxed out include Assassin's
Creed Odyssey and Metro Exodus in most
of the new games that I'm testing with
currently the RX 517 GTX 1650 will good
for over 60 FPS at 1080p using the ultra
quality preset that's I know those of
you with higher refresh rate monitors do
like to keep the minimum FPS above 60 so
ivory tested both GPUs using the higher
medium presets and I'm interested to see
if this changes the margins for example
will it favor one GPU moreso than the
other so today we plan to find out
please note that when changing a quality
preset the game was closed and then re
executed to make sure the changes were
applied so it was a very tedious process
but I was interested to see the results
so hopefully you guys will be as well as
usual the standard GPU test rig has been
used which comprises of a karo 919 okay
clocked at 5 gigahertz with 32 gigabytes
of ddr4 34-hundred memory and of course
it is built inside the corsair crystal
570 ex ok without wasting any more time
let's get into the results first up we
have Assassin's Creed Odyssey and here
we see pretty similar scaling
performance within the 1650 and rx 570
dropping down to medium does seem like
an appropriate quality preset for these
GPUs and Assassin's Creed Odyssey as it
allowed us to average just over 60 FPS
now the battlefield 5 results are really
surprising really strange even I
retested the 1650 a few times to try and
work out what was going on here but for
whatever reason I saw almost no
performance uplift when downgrading the
quality preset from ultra
then from high to medium the frame rates
jumped by 23% so that was clearly some
changes being made but it just wasn't as
impactful as I would have expected and
this means where is the GTX 1615 RX 570
were comparable using the ultra quality
preset the RX 570 ran away with it when
using the high and medium presets again
this is really strange I'm not entirely
sure if this is just a driver bug or if
it's something more anyway I will keep
an eye on it preset scaling and dirt
rally to was pretty standard much like
what we saw in Assassin's Creed Odyssey
here the performance margins remained
very much the same between the RX v 7e
and GT x 1650 moving on we see much the
same with the division to the margins
remained very similar using the ultra
high and medium quality presets
naturally the frame rates did increase
quite dramatically as we lowered the
quality settings but the margins
remained much the same and as a result
here the RX 570 was 27% faster across
the board the margins also remained very
similar when testing with farcry new
dawn here the RX 5-7 it was around 20
percent faster regardless of the quality
preset used the gtx 1650 does fare a
little better in Forza horizon 4 as we
reduced the quality levels using the
ultra preset the RX 570 was 26 percent
faster then with the higher quality
preset that margin is reduced to 21
percent and then 20 percent using medium
not a massive difference but the 1650
did come back a little like most of the
games we've looked at so far the margins
remained much the same when testing with
fortnight the one percent low
performance for the 1650 does improve
with the high preset but then fell away
once again with the medium preset Metro
Exodus which is an Nvidia sponsored
title favors the radio and GPU much more
we're using the high and medium quality
presets with the ultra settings enabled
the RX 570 was just 10% faster when
comparing the four gigabyte models
however that margin is extended to 26%
with the higher quality preset
maintained with the medium quality
settings so basically the game becomes
less game work see once you lower the
visual quality settings the RX 570
enjoyed a 30% lead over the GTX 1650 in
resident evil 2 when using the ultra
quality settings that margin though is
reduced to 23% with the high and
quality presets when testing with
Rainbow six siege we said the gtex 1650
and rx 570 are basically neck-and-neck
when using the ultra quality preset
speaking of which I just like to note an
error in my day one gtx 1650 review I
had the GTX 1650 beating the rx 570 in
this title but after a retest that's not
actually the case the performance for
all other Radeon GPUs such as the rx 5
ad and 590 are correct so I'm not sure
what happened with the rx 570 in the
original test anyway that's been
corrected now and as you can see with
the ultra quality preset they're
basically on par similar margins were
seen when using the higher quality
preset while the RX 570 does sneak away
a little bit with the medium quality
settings the RX 570 and gtx 1650 are
fairly well matched and shadow of the
Tomb Raider with the ultra quality
preset enabled however once we drop down
to the high preset the radeon GPU pulls
ahead by an 18 percent margin and we
also see a similar margin to that when
using the medium quality settings last
up we have World War Z and this is
another big win for the radeon GPU here
the RX 570 was 38% faster with the ultra
quality settings and that margin was
pretty well maintained with the high and
medium quality presets as well so no
real changes there with the exception of
just a few oddities the GTX 16:15 rx 570
scaled very evenly across the range of
tested presets now the battlefield 5
results they were a bit bizarre I
suspect that some kind of driver issue
like I said re tested a few times and
the GTX 1650 just continued to produce
bizarre results there so I'll keep an
eye on that one and then the only other
game was Metro Exodus and that one well
that one went in favor of the rx 570
with the high and medium quality
settings opposed to the ultra quality
settings that we normally test at
overall though as long as you're testing
with more than just a few select games
the quality presets shouldn't have too
much of an impact on your findings
overall so you should end up with pretty
similar performance margins at the end
of the day I have seen a few people
complain that these budget mid-range
GPUs shouldn't be tested using high to
ultra quality type settings but as we've
proven for the most part the margins
don't change
it won't impact the conclusion of course
performance does depend on the game for
example the second-highest preset in
Assassin's Creed Odyssey so not the
highest preset but dialing down to the
second highest quality preset that still
Saurus limited to about 40 fps somewhere
in the mid forties but then you take Far
Cry New Dawn Forza horizon for Resident
Evil 2 Rainbow six siege and World War Z
for example all of those popped out over
70 FPS on average using the maximum in
game quality preset so I feel using
lower quality settings with graphics
cards of this caliber really isn't
necessary as I said in a lot of the
games these cards were pushing over 60
FPS so that is obviously plenty of
frames and by using the high to ultra
quality presets we do basically push
them to their limits so if there's a
card with a limited vram buffer that'll
show some issues there and basically
that indicates that the card may not be
a great investment because of its
struggling now it's certainly not going
to be particularly handy in 6 for 12
months time something else too haven't
really made mention of is the fact that
both the four and a gigabyte versions of
our X 570 were included in this testing
and with the exception of a few ultra
quality tests we saw no real difference
in performance between the two and they
were matched at the same clock speeds
Assassin's Creed Odyssey and shut off
the Tomb Raider saw small performance
gains when using the ultra quality
presets but beyond that all other tests
were within the margin of error so I
wouldn't go paying too much of a premium
for that extra vram but if it's only
done no 10 to 20 dollars more than ya
get the extra memory because it will
come and hand you down the track anyway
that is going to do it for this one hope
