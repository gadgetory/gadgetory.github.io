again discussing the principle
technologies benchmark study it was
commissioned by Intel and was accessible
to the public after Intel's
recent event on the 8th now in a
previous video I taught the paid
benchmark study apart exposing a number
of glaring issues with the results I
thought this was something that would
very much interest our subscriber base
and it certainly caused a lot of fuss
with our patreon members in our private
discord chat in fact it was a few of our
longtime members who requested that we
dig into the results to try and
replicate them or better yet correct
them so that's what I ended up doing so
the plan initially was pretty simple we
were to dig into this for our patreon
members and provide them with the
results our results to see how they
compared to the results from PT so I did
this and what we found was quite
shocking so much so that the patreon
members demanded that a video be created
on the main channel and it didn't take
too much to convince me I was pretty
much already on it as I said I felt this
was something that our subscribers would
be interested in and after all it is a
very relevant topic to this channel
we're quite well known for our in-depth
CPU and GPU benchmarks what I didn't
expect was for this to plop up quite
like it did and since then we've seen a
lot of other media outlets pick up on it
and some have done their own digging
Steve from gamers Nexus has done a lot
of good work on this topic and we
suspect that GN Steve would have
probably been just as quick to the punch
as we were if they weren't on a plane
returning from the Intel event where
they first saw the suspect results that
made Steve's hair stand on end at least
that's what Paul from Paul's heart which
tells me anyway so I'm going to assume
you've seen the first video that we did
and that's why you're watching this
video having said that though let's just
quickly summarize a few of the main
issues that I raised in that previous
video I was upset that Intel went ahead
and published their own testing done
suspiciously through a third-party ten
days before the real reviews would be
alive effectively blocking reviews from
refuting the 9900 K data this was my
main issue with all of this not so much
that the PT results looked off but the
Intel was publishing them well ahead of
independent reviews after
the numbers I concluded that it was
quite obvious the principle technologies
arise and results did not align with our
own findings and I wish to point out
that our own findings do align with the
results of the majority of the tech
channels and tech websites out there I
went on to say that I didn't have too
much of an issue with Intel
commissioning the report itself and I
noted that the principal technologies
report was very transparent as they
clear standard how they conducted their
testing again my main gripe was with
Intel and how they were exploiting this
situation we believed to fool consumers
and booster preorder sales of the ninth
Gen Core processors as I said since then
a number of media outlets have picked up
on the story and others have even done
their own investigations and added to it
PT has since responded as as Intel
Intel's response was typically corporate
while PT are defending their work and
credibility which is understandable and
it sounds like they are attempting to
correct their wrongs so it seems at
least on their end
this could just be a series of honest
mistakes made by Principal technologies
very the more we learn about them the
less likely that seem as possible in
spite of that though I am willing to
give them a chance to sort the numbers
out and make this right having said that
though that probably wouldn't be
probably wouldn't be as much of a big
deal as it is if this benchmark study
hadn't been made public ahead of the
release of the ninth Gen Core Series now
we mostly just wouldn't have cared
anyway let's just assume everything is
above board here which may very well be
or at least was intended to be possibly
a big stretch on my behalf but for
argument's sake let's just go with that
for now
Intel paid PT to conduct the independent
benchmark study that could be used to
show partners and media how much better
the core o nine ninety nine hundred K
was than competing products Intel could
of course do their own benchmarking and
provide media with the review guide as I
often do but most of us just ignore
those results and use them as a rough
guide which is what we should do so
Intel pays PT because they have roughly
16 years of experience and are trusted
by their clients to do a good job Intel
would have outlined that they wanted an
in-depth benchmark using stock CPU or
memory frequencies something along those
lines PT then goes away
ducks the benchmarks puts together a
detailed PDF that they then submit to
Intel for approval again something along
those lines
intel approves the PDF and provides it
to media at their event at which point
it's no longer under any kind of embargo
and can be distributed freely just as we
saw now in that scenario I have no issue
with what PT has done they were
commissioned to carry out a benchmark
study by Intel and they did just that
nothing wrong there in our opinion the
study was deeply flawed but let's ignore
that for now assuming my hypothetical
scenario is accurate or roughly accurate
PT has been thrown in some pretty hot
water
shortly after their study entered the
public domain and irate Australian tore
it apart it was quite obvious there were
some serious mistakes made when testing
the horizon 720 700 X a key CPU in the
comparison now didn't L know the 2,700 X
was well down on where it should be I
can't believe for a second that Intel
didn't know exactly what their
competition was capable of and how the
horizon 720 700 perform of course it's
not in Intel's best interest to correct
PT I suspect these results were probably
seen as a gift as they're basically a
best-case scenario
Intel aside for a moment this as I said
puts P T in some seriously hot water as
their integrity is called into question
either that or their competence there's
just too many basic but very serious
mistakes made here and Steve from gamers
Nexus has done a good job of
highlighting them as have our viewers
those of you not to speed issues
included using different memory settings
for AMD and Intel platforms though that
now appears to have just been a mistake
in the documentation the memory
configuration though still wasn't
optimal horizon the use of canned
benchmarks almost exclusively for CPU
testing is an ideal they also used an
inferior cooler to test the horizon 720
700 X and they didn't report the average
of multiple runs they used questionable
quality settings and the biggest one of
all and the main one that sticks out at
us was the fact they disabled half the
cause in the 2,700 X essentially turning
it into a quad-core and therefore
placing it at an unbelievable
disadvantage
now in my initial video the bulk of my
frustration and criticism was directed
at Intel for creating this situation I
felt that the PT testing was seriously
flawed and did not come close to
reflecting how gamers would configure
their eyes in seven systems and well we
now know that to be true but my focus
and frustration was primarily on Intel
frankly I'm not really that interested
in taking PT to task they got paid to do
what they do and if they made a series
of honest mistakes then fine it's well
worth noting that if P T's results were
released after real independent reviews
were alive and we really wouldn't even
be talking about this it might be
something that Tim chuckled about for a
minute and his news corner segment on a
Friday but really that's about it
Intel commissioning misleading
benchmarks certainly isn't great
intentional or otherwise but it's
reasonably harmless once the internet
has been flooded with accurate
information so P teammates and mistakes
and they're now responding by looking
into them co-founder of principled
technologies bill Catchings reached out
to us with an official response under
the responses to inquiries header they
said the following we have received a
number of inquiries regarding the
testing methodology we used and the
potential for bias in favor of Intel
we're providing additional information
as transparent as possible and help
allay these concerns they are
investigating them all key issues a
three of which include the use of game
mode the choice to use the AMD box
cooler and then the memory speeds they
plan to re test with all cores enabled
and will update the report with those
results so that is good news I hope they
do retest with the knocked or Nhu 14s at
this point they have justified why they
use the Box cooler but that doesn't
really make any sense but it's certainly
far less of an issue than disabling the
cause they also justified the choice to
use for sixteen gigabyte modules on all
configurations not an ideal setup for me
if the XMP settings weren't loaded
though they now claimed that they were
so I don't have too much of an issue
with this the other issues such as only
using a single resolution and medium to
high type quality settings well I guess
ok not everyone can test a wide range of
games at multiple resolutions and
quality settings so let's keep it real
anyway bill wrapped up he's a response
by saying but
our goal is always to do the right thing
and get the answers right we're
currently doing additional testing we
will share that data and we'll certainly
call that if something is significantly
different to what we've already
published we are confident in our test
methodology and results okay not to drag
bill and Petey over the coals again but
the testing methods used don't come
close to meeting the standards used by
respectable media outlets in 2018 not to
mention they don't come close to
representing the configurations used by
the vast majority of gamers that said I
look forward to seeing their updated
results because they had better believe
that enabling the other 50% of the 2700
acts will lead to significantly
different results significantly better
results as for Intel well I don't have
anything more to add from the previous
video but as I've said I'm mostly
blaming Intel for creating the situation
and not principal technologies and that
said their credibility has been called
into question and rightfully so
over on the Intel website we find a page
titled performance benchmark test
disclosure as a seriously long page but
right at the bottom we find this
principal technologies benchmark
disclosure Intel as a sponsor and member
of the benchmark X PRT development
community and was the major developer of
the X PRT family of benchmarks principal
technologies is the publisher of the X
PRT family of benchmarks you should
consult other information and
performance tests to assist you and
fully evaluating your contemplated
purchases basically on that page it
stated that PT is used to provide
performance claims for a number of Intel
7th and 8th gen core products biased
performance claims then Intel paid for
and to cover their backside legally they
are forced to disclose that at the
bottom of the page it seems as we
suspected PT were acting in accordance
with guidelines provided by Intel I'm
starting to suspect that they were told
to use the game mode with the 2,700 X
what they do or don't do next will be
very telling in any case Intel's clearly
been forced to state that this isn't an
independent or reliable source of
information and as such consumers should
look elsewhere to receive purchasing
advice moving on to wrap all this up
half the main motive behind exposing
this wasn't for views as bill the
co-founder of PT suggested in his
interview with gamers Nexus a rather it
was to alert consumers that the 50%
performance uplift claim that was made
by PC gamers N and a news article that
was unrealistic
on that note though I would like to just
quickly point out that PC gamers and
were quick to act and they corrected
their news story shortly after reviewing
my findings so kudos to them in the
words of some famous organizations are
you part of the solution or part of the
problem my suggestion for solving this
and avoiding any risk of confusion the
future is to keep any results of a
commission test under embargo until
independent reviews go live
simultaneously if you're going to use PT
to create a review guide or help prepare
internal marketing and sure do that but
what was done here was unacceptable and
anti-consumer if you're interested in
learning more about how the core i7 87
arcane rise in 720 700x really compare
we have a number of videos covering this
subject in extreme detail you can find
benchmarks covering well over 30 games
at 3 resolutions comparing both the
average frame rate as well as frame time
performance based on an average of 3
runs mostly focused on ingame custom
benchmark passes you can also get a
strong sense of how much disabling
caused in the 2700 x impacts gaming
performance by looking at our in-depth
video titled is rise a more future proof
for gamers
there's loads of great information and
results in that video and it'll give you
a good sense of just how unfair the
testing conducted by PT really is I've
heard it claims that these big companies
will start to do more of this in an
effort to control the narrative and as a
result mate reviewers such as myself
redundant that's obviously not going to
happen for a few reasons most notably of
which is you the viewer and we work hard
each and every day to earn your trust
and as a trusted resource it makes sense
that you'd seek out our benchmarks and
not those commissioned by a corporation
on that note I hope some lessons have
been learned here I successfully shut
down I'm I suppose you can even say
destroyed any attempts to mislead
consumers with the PT benchmark results
so will we see a repeat of this
from Intel with their next big product
launch or any other major company for
that matter in this industry well if
they're smart simply no because you can
rest assured that will jump all over at
once again along with everyone else who
called the results into question anyway
hopefully PT finds what they should with
the rest of the 2,700 X turned on they
amend the document and we don't have to
discuss this again and I can get back to
doing some real benchmarking if you did
