been 10 years actually almost 11 years
now since Intel released its first
quad-core desktop CPU the glued together
called 2 quad q6600 and what a glorious
cpu it was the 65 nanometer quad core
operate at 2.4 gigahertz but back then
boost clocks weren't a thing and CPUs
operated on a frontside bus we've seen
eight major architectural updates and
four die shrinks spanning a decade yet
in all that time Intel only offers up to
a quad core for its mainstream product
lines most of which is the KB lake based
core i7 77 or okay which was released
back in January of this year for 340
dollars u.s. however shortly after that
AMD did something that we'd all hope
they do but certainly weren't convinced
they could or at least I wasn't
convinced they could and that of course
was to release a CPU architecture that
was good really good a horizon certainly
disrupted Intel's business as usual type
attitude and it's been fireworks ever
since in a nutshell
aimed at Intel the hardest by offering
more cause for less money that was kind
of the strategy with bulldozer but the
key ingredient here being that the cause
didn't completely suck IPC performance
is slightly down Intel's latest and
greatest offerings but there really
isn't that much in an Horizons
efficiency certainly is very good so
they're not really giving up anything
they're actually the biggest advantage
Intel has right now is their superior
clock speeds and this is something a me
hopes to address next year before and II
can do that though Intel's heading back
with their eighth generation Core Series
and with that they're addressing one of
Verizon's biggest advantages cause lots
of cause although horizon 7 will still
have a core count advantage Intel is now
making six cores the standard for their
high-end parts the new Core i5 and core
i7 processors now packs six cores and
that's going to have a very big impact
on hand today we have the flagship model
the core i7 8700 K which is based on
Intel's latest architecture codenamed
coffee Lake I also have the core i5 8400
but I'll be focusing on that CPU in
another video shortly unfortunately at
this time that I don't actually have the
Core i5
86 under okay
the unlocked core i5 but I will get my
hands on one of those shortly as well as
the core i3 models anyway for now their
focus is on the big guy the 6 quart 12
thread monster known as the 8700 K
designed to operate no slower than 3.7
gigahertz it will boost a single core as
high as 4.7 gigahertz and under full
load should maintain an operating
frequency of 4.3 gigahertz each of the
six cores feature a 256 kilobyte level 2
cache while there is a much larger 12
megabyte level 3 cache intel has given
the chip a 95 watt TDP rating and once
again they are using the LGA 1151 socket
though this can be considered as like a
version 2 as it will be in no way
compatible with the previous KB lake or
skylake cpus now the price has been
increased from the 7700 K as the 8700 K
comes in and a rather steep 360 dollars
u.s. and that is a $20 price hike from
the KB Lake flagship part it's also $60
more than AMD's risin 7 1700 that's the
company's cheapest horizon 7 part and it
is of course unlocked these 1700 X is
also priced at 260 dollars but smart
shoppers will opt for the cheaper 9x
model I've personally had just as much
luck overclocking both the X and 9x
models to 4 gigahertz moving on it's
great to see that unlike the high-end
desktop sky like experts on the LGA 2066
socket the new coffee-like cpus still
use the ring bus and not the mesh
interconnect method which is used by the
higher core counterparts
this is great news because it means the
8700 k will maintain the 77 area k's
gaming prowess and should if being in
fact able to take things to the next
level for gamers so without wasting any
more time let's see how this thing
handles jump into the benchmarks let's
first take a look at memory bandwidth
performance please note all CPUs were
tested using ddr4 3200 CL 14 memory that
in mind it's interesting to note that
the core i7 87 ok does take a step
forward from the 77 ok is now on par
with the horizon 5 CPS with around 36
gigabytes per second and memory
bandwidth that said though it's still
trailing the rise in 7 models by around
2 gigabytes per second
ok so let's check out the Cinebench r15
scores as luck would have it after a 3
run average the
87 okay matched the r7 1700 with a
multi-threaded score of fourteen hundred
and twenty three points that did mean it
was thirteen percent sold in the 1800 ex
but still an impressive result all the
same actually what's really impressive
here is the single core score and this
explains how a six core Intel CPU kept
pace with an eight core AMD CPU the 8700
K provides the same 195 point single
thread scores of 77 okay and by
extension the 77 40 X so the 8700 K is
looking pretty solid all around it also
completely dusts the core i7 7 heretics
as well so kind of sucks if you bought
one of those recently maybe all we have
PC mark 10 and this gives us a look at
how these CPUs compare in more general
use case scenarios core count isn't that
important for the most part here it's
really all about the frequency for that
reason the core i7 87 or K does
extremely well outscoring the semi
Tamarack 8 by 5 percent margin Excel is
an office type benchmark which can
utilize many threads especially when
running the extreme Monte Carlo
simulation 3700 K finds itself situated
between the Rison 7 1700 in the 1800 x
with a completion time of 2.5 5 seconds
this also makes it around 13 percent
faster than the core i7 700 x another 6
core Intel CPU testing with veracrypt we
see that this time the 87 here ok trails
the horizon 7 1700 though it is still
around 10% faster than the core i7 700 X
and 14 percent faster than AMD 6 core r5
1600 then moving on we have
non-encrypted compression and
decompression performance using 7-zip
whereas hyper threading sees a similar
level of efficiency when compressing and
decompressing SMT is significantly more
efficient for the decompression work
here we sent the 8700 K does very well
and it's around 50 percent faster than
the 7700 K handbrake is a popular
application for encoding and we've used
to convert a 4k h.264 video to 1080p
using h.265 and then recorded the
average frame rate he'll arise in 7 1700
sped out 11 frames per second on average
while the 1800 X managed 12 point 6
frames per second not bad but the new
core i7 87 ROK went complete beast mode
with an average of 13.8 frames a second
making it 10% faster in the 1800 X
11% faster than the 7800 X next up we
have premier and we know this
application lacks cause but it also
loves clock speed the new core i7 8700 K
completed the encode in 195 seconds
which is just a few seconds slower than
the rise in seven 1800 X so a very
impressive result for the core i7 CPU
here
moving on to some rendering tests we
have blender and first up were running
the rising graphic 27 test once again
the 87 or K finds itself in a verizon 7
sandwich with a completion time of 25.8
seconds this made it almost 40% faster
than the core i7 77 okay and Rison 5
1600 in this test the gooseberry
workload paints somewhat of a different
picture and this extreme workload the 87
okay is able to pull the head of the
Rison 7 1800 excess now 14% faster and 8
percent faster than the 7800 X Corona
comes as a standalone benchmark it
renders a fix seen six times and we take
the time it takes to complete the entire
task this time the 8700 K is closer to
the r7 1700 than it is the 1800 X but
even so render time of just a hundred
and forty-two seconds for a six core CPU
is mighty impressive povery is another
ray tracer it's been around for many
years and we're using the official
benchmark again the 8700 K is closer to
the r7 1700 than it is the 1800 X but
even so it's a good bit faster than the
now redundant 700 X alright so time for
a few quick gaming benchmarks before we
look at the power consumption and
temperatures here we're testing
battlefield one using the DirectX 12 API
with the ultra quality preset enabled
all the games have been tested using the
gtx 980ti in vegas 64 GPUs and first up
we have the GeForce results even with
the GTX 1080i at 1080p
we are GPU limited battlefield 1 using
the ultra quality settings for this
reason the 87 ok is limited to the same
157 FPS as the 7700 K the horizon cpus
meanwhile look quite a bit slower
despite delivering over 100 FPS at all
times that said it is worth note that
can be an issue with the rise in CPU is
when using an NVIDIA GPU in DirectX 12
titles so let's check out the Vegas 64
results although we are slightly more
GPU bound here with the slower Vegas 64
GPU what's key to note here is that
while the 8700 K and 77 ok frame rates
are slightly reduced the
and CPUC a rather significant boost in
framerate there of course still slower
than the Intel CPUs but the margin is
significantly reduced
we'll take a look at this again in a
moment while trying to remove the GPU
bottleneck next up we have ashes of the
singularity and here the core i7 87 okay
really shows what it can do as it
roughly matches the core i7 7820 action
thread Ripper 1920 x in this core heavy
game the average frame rate was boosted
by 17 percent over the 72 ember ok and
25% over the horizon 7 1700 swapping out
the GTX 1082 I for Vegas 64 actually
helps put the 87 okay ahead of the
thread Ripper CPU though with that
exception the rest of the margins are
really much the same moving on a
civilization 6 we see the core i7 87 ok
is roughly on par with the 77 ok as well
as aim DS rise in 7 1800 X and this is
with the GeForce GTX 292 I so some
pretty competitive looking results here
please note that in my Intel Core i 979
80 XE and 79 60 X reviewed the horizon 7
frame rates were higher than what's
shown here I wasn't able to determine if
this was a mistake made on my behalf or
if it was down to a game patch or a
driver update previously the 1800 X was
pushing 112 FPS on average with Vegas 64
and now we're down to a hundred FPS I'm
constantly retesting and sometimes we do
find a change like this in some games
mafia 3 for example was dropped from the
testing as the performance often changed
quite dramatically with each update
anyway it's worth noting that we are
still seeing vastly superior performance
on the rise and 7 CPUs with Vega 64 it's
just not as extreme as I showed
previously whereas the 8700 K was 4
percent faster with Vegas 64 compared to
the GTX 1082 I the 1800 X is almost 20%
faster so civilization still providing
some very interesting results when
comparing the g-force of Radeon GPUs in
the DirectX 12 API the last game we're
going to look at is f1 2017 at first up
we have the GTX 1082 our results here
the 8700 K was actually slower than the
77 okay which is a bit odd it seems this
title can get a bit confused when there
are more than 4 cores on offer that said
though the 77k is clearly faster than
the 72nd RK and this is the same case
when looking at the rise and 5/16
hundred and fifteen hundred X even with
a
sixty-four we find much the same between
the 77 okay and 8700 K though there is a
bit of reshuffling in the midfield and
it is the Scarlet hex parts that seem to
lose out the most to you
overall though the 87 okay was slightly
slower than the 70 Center okay in this
title okay so before wrapping up the
gaming let's just quickly retest
battlefield 1 at the ultra low 720p
resolution to try and remove the GPU
bottleneck while still maintaining the
ultra quality settings previously the
8700 K was only able to match the 77
okay it wasn't much faster than the 7600
K however by removing the GPU bottleneck
we're running to another issue
battlefield ones 200 FPS hard cap the
8700 K was able to keep the GTX 1080i at
200 FPS for the majority of our tests
and this means it could be much faster
than the 10 percent margin we see here
over the 77 okay it's now 27% faster in
the 7600 K and 55 percent fast in the
horizon 7 1800 X although the Rison 7
1800 looked how should I say almost
pathetic with the GTX 1080i it's a bit
of a different story with Vega 64 here
it's 20% slower than the 87 okay and
while that's still a fair old margin it
is much better than what we saw
previously with the GTX 10 atti this
every similar cake is also quite a bit
faster than the Radeon graphics card as
well but unfortunately the 87 RK is
again limited by the game's artificial
frame cap anyway one thing's for sure
the 87 or K is an incredibly powerful
gaming CPU next up we have power
consumption it's important to measure
using software that stresses all cause I
found that Corona works very well for
providing accurate results so these load
figures are based on the corona
benchmark after a single pass and I'm
reporting the maximum logged a result
this is total system draw and I'm using
the Quebec power mate to measure from
the wall when it comes to power draw the
core i7 87 or ek is certainly on the
higher side but it's not as Extreme as
what we saw from the sky like X CPUs the
700 X for example was not only slower in
every single test but it also pushed
whole system draw 17% higher when
compared to the risin 7 1800 X 280 700 K
did increase system consumption by 18
percent so until isn't quite as
efficient as they have had to increase
frequency quite aggressively in order to
keep pace with AMD's 8 core rise and 7
processors still overall I'm impressed
with what Intel's me now to achieve here
the only 700 case
it looks very solid all around now I'm
very keen to see how the thing
overclocks if you deleted your 77 or
okay you could probably get about five
gigahertz out of it maybe 5.1 gigahertz
with very little effort we managed to
push my 8700 k chip to five point two
gigahertz and here it was 100% stable I
could even boot into Windows at five
point three gigahertz and run a few
tests but it will require finer voltage
tuning for 100% stability we didn't
really have too much time to play around
with overclocking just yet so I settled
on five point two you hurt I felt like
that was probably impressive enough as
it was this impressive overclock also
means that the AE 700 K is now able to
match the multi-core score of the 1800 X
in Cinebench r15
well devastating the single thread
result that said you can of course
overclock the 1800 X and that does allow
it to remain ahead for the proactivity
workloads speaking of which this is how
the overclocks changed the corona
results overclocking the 87 or okay
meant that it was able to complete this
task 15 percent faster than its out of
the box configuration that said though
the 1800 X did see a 20% improvement
once overclocked the horizon 7 1800
overclock increased system power draw by
whopping 42% and this was the exact same
figure seen when overclocking the 87 or
okay as well neither provided anywhere
near that kind of performance gain so as
usual the efficiency kind of goes out
the window once you overclock I haven't
had a chance to build my new core i7 87
or okay test system yet but you can bet
I will be doing that over the next few
days or so and it will become my new GPU
testing machine for now though I'm using
the deep core captain 240 X RGB it's an
all-in-one liquid cooler with a 240
millimeter radiator it's a decent
solution though the Noctua NHD 15 air
cooler has been reported to deliver
slightly better temperatures on an
overclocked 77r okay for example that
said the d 15 is about as good as air
coolers get anyway with a room
temperature of 21 degrees the 8700 k
idled at just 25 degrees when stressing
both the CPU and FPU temperatures did
hit 84 degrees meanwhile just stressing
the CPU saw temps max out at 60 degrees
then once overclocked to 5.2 gigahertz
running the CPU stress test we did get
within 6 degrees of the t.j.maxx
peaking at 97 degrees briefly obviously
a dealer would really help
tremendously here for those seeking more
extreme overclocks and a more extreme
cooling solution probably wouldn't hurt
either Intel's made some pretty big
performance claims when it comes to the
eighth generation core series but with
50% more cores on the core i5 and core
i7 parts claiming up to 25% more frames
in games isn't that bold that said
though are these gains just down to the
outer cores are are there some
architectural improvements made here to
increase the IPC some sources have
suggested up to a 10% increase in IPC so
let's look into that what I've done for
this test is locked the 8700 K and 77 or
okay at 4.5 gigahertz
I've also disabled two of the 87 arcades
cause essentially mimicking the
configuration of the 77 ok first up we
have seen a bench r15 as you can plainly
see the four core and eight threads
clocked at 4.5 gigahertz just like we
have with the 77 okay 3700 cade delivers
basically the same scores after a three
run average it was slightly slower in
the multi-threaded test as expected that
almost 50% increase in score comes from
a 50% increase in cause testing with
Corona we again see the semi 7k is
slightly fast in the 87 okay when they
are both matched with the same core and
thread count at 4.5 gigahertz again
adding two more cores makes the 87 RK
almost 50% faster and finally power
consumption this is an interesting one
the 87 okay does pack 50% more level 3
cache to support those extra cores and
this isn't something we can disable when
turning off those cores so here we see
that when comparing the four core 8
thread configurations the 87 or K does
push system consumption 10% higher at
the same clock speed then with those
extra cores enabled the total system
drawer is increased by 33% okay before
we wrap this review up we should
probably check out a few price versus
performance scatter plots to work out
just how well the 87 our case stacks up
in terms of value
looking at the Premiere Pro CC results
we see at the core i7 8700 K is a good
step forward from the recently released
7800 X it's both faster and cheaper
compared to the horizon 7 1700 the 8700
K was 8% faster but it also costs 20%
more still it is much better value than
the r7 1800 X overclocking does muddy
the water a bit here so we're not going
to focus on that for this review I'll
cover the overclocking stuff in a bit
more detail in a future video for near
the r7 1700 looks too
content creators with the best value
option but the core i7 87 okay is
certainly a viable option and I didn't
feel this was the case with the
superhero ex for example for the extreme
blender workload the 87 okay does very
well again it's 20% more costly than the
r7 1700 but it's also 20% faster out of
the box in terms of value the r5 1600 is
still the best option but for it to get
anywhere near the stock 8700 have to
overclock it to at least 4 gigahertz so
Intel puts forth an extremely compelling
option here for gamers especially high
refresh rate gaming it's pretty obvious
that Intel CPUs are the way to go in
terms of performance and value as we saw
with the 720p results the 8700 K was GPU
limited at 1080p I snuck in the 720p
testing last minute as I finished up
this review so I don't have any price
versus performance scatterplot stuff for
that but needless to say Intel wins
quite comfortably here using Vega 64 we
are again GPU limited though it has to
be said the rise in CPS perform much
better with a radeon GPU when using the
DirectX 12 API so if a game is hoping to
maximize their dollar the Rison 5 1600
still presents a great value option and
is arguably the most cost effective
choice for anyone who isn't after
extreme high refresh rate type gaming
finally when looking at the ashes of the
singularity results with Vega 64 we
again see an extremely impressive result
from the 8700 and it's a good bit fast
in the previous gaming King the 7700 ok
these figures also really suggests to me
that the 87 R K isn't just the new king
of gaming right now but it also will be
well into the future well they have an
intelligent you main stream flagship
Core i7 processor and what a beast it is
for gamers seeking the ultimate gaming
experience that simply is nothing better
than the core i7 87 ok right now it
really has no weakness out of the box
the performance was incredible
overclocking is probably even more
incredible and power consumption really
was impressive for a CPU running at well
over 4 gigahertz out of the box and for
all those reasons it's certainly going
to find its way into my new gaming rig
speaking of which I will be using the
new MSI a Zed 370 godlike and that board
the board here to my left was used for
all their testing in this video and it
did enable that impressive 5.2 gigahertz
overclock I'm also keen to see how much
further I can push the 87 ok once I do
build my new system so
little bit more tinkering to be done
there but it should be a bit of fun the
only slight down it is of course the
price and I'm not talking about the
godlike though that is a ridiculously
expensive motherboard I believe it's
about 700 Australian dollars so yeah
it's the cream of the crop MSI say
anyway
as for the 87 ook at three hundred and
sixty dollars us it is a little bit more
expensive than a semi semi okay the CPS
replacing but make no mistake the 87
okay is a serious step up from the 77
okay but at the same time it's also a
bit of a costly affair particularly when
compared to something like the horizon 5
1600 for example I feel the majority of
gamers will be better served by the r5
1600 though having said that I'm yet to
check out the coffee-like core i5 range
and I'll be doing that very shortly
still the 8700 K really only makes sense
for those after extreme frame rates with
the latest and greatest gaming hardware
all those playing cs:go at 720p using
low quality settings on the GTX 1060
anyway as I said all this framerate
madness isn't cheap once you dish out
three hundred and six dollars for the 87
okay you really want to spend at least
another hundred dollars or so on a
decent cooler
realistically you could spend as little
as twenty dollars on a basic air cooler
but I feel like that's doing this
incredible
overclocker a disservice anyway let's
say $20 to be conservative now we're at
$400 and then once you factor in a
decent said 370 board for say around 150
dollars you now have a $550 combo moving
on from gaming though what about
productivity well the core i7 87 or okay
has the horizon 7 1800 beat quite
convincingly it almost wasn't a contest
that said the 1800 X was already a dead
ship and our eyes before the 87 okay
even came along compared to the r7 1700
the 8700 K is at best on par in terms of
value but with both overclocked to the
max the rise in seven CPU should offer a
little more even so it will vary from
one application to the next and I'd say
overall they are very similar again
though those on a budget will up for
rise and as it is cheaper and it will
deliver a similar level of performance
without much trouble
still the 8700 K really has proven to be
much more of an all around us certainly
much more so than the 77 or okay was
therefore overall I really like Intel's
new core i7 87 okay and I can't wait to
check out the rest of the coffee-like
range
2017 has already proven to be in apps
we've spectacular year for PC hardware
and it's great to see so many impressive
options available to consumers with that
I hope you guys enjoyed the review I'm
