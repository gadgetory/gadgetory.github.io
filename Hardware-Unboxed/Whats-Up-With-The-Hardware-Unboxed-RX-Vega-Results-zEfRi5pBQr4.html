video I want to discuss some of the
results from my day one valued coverage
as well as share a few opinions so two
days ago now I rushed at my vega 56
coverage having only received the card
the day prior to the release that is so
it wasn't really ideal but that's what
we had to work with anyway I was very
excited to discover what Vega was all
about so I pulled my first all-nighter
of the year and tested 25 games the days
prior to the release or the days prior
to receiving the Vega 56 sample I spent
testing six other GPUs for the
comparison so we had fresh data for 25
games at 1080p 1440p and 4k overall I
found that Vega 56 was on par with the
geforce gtx 1070 MSI's custom-designed
gaming x mall no lesson i'll touch on
the reference versus custom card subject
a bit later in the video getting back to
the testing there was one result that
stood out like a sore thumb and that was
dirt for here Vega 56 was an
unexplainably 32 percent faster than the
gtx 1070
despite providing a full disclaimer and
warning viewers that these results are
massive outliers and until they can be
confirmed take them with a grain of salt
but yeah despite that a few viewers got
very upset called the benchmarks fakin
or that usual angry pitchfork stuff
anyway as all the reviews went live I
began combing the internet looking for
other dirt for Vega results eventually I
stumbled upon a hard OC peer review from
longtime tech veteran Carl Bennett
unfortunately Kyle didn't test Vega 56
but he did compare Vega 64 alongside the
geforce gtx 1080 and 1070 so that's
really going to tell me all i need to
know the problem for me at least was
that Kyle's results were basically the
complete opposite to what I was showing
here Vega 64 was 10% slower from the GC
X 1080 quite different to the 32 percent
gain Vega 56 had over the gtx 1070 in my
video my heart sank
and I immediately thought I've screwed
up
big time I was also really confused and
I couldn't work out what I might have
done wrong as I spent over an hour
confirming all the dirt for results
three times anyway at this point it was
2:00 a.m. on Tuesday morning just a few
hours after the reviews went live so I
went to bed and had a bit of a think I
100% trust and all the results the guys
over at hard OCP throw up so I knew
there had to be something more to it the
next day I woke up with the intention of
looking into this further and it was
then that I know as Carl was testing
with eight times msaa enables an
extremely aggressive anti-aliasing
method there's certainly nothing wrong
with that but I tested using CMAA so
could there be something in that
conservative morphological anti-aliasing
is position between
fxaa and SMA in terms of computation
cost so it's another high-performance
alternative to traditional multi sample
anti-aliasing otherwise known as MSA a
the technique was originally developed
by Intel for using Codemasters grid 2
video game the obvious thing to do here
was retest all the graphics cards using
8 x msaa and then for good measure
disable anti-aliasing altogether so
let's start with the disabled AAA
results here we see Vega 56 is indeed
much fast in the gtx 10:17 29% faster in
fact i also added the founders edition
model which was 2% sold in the MSI
gaming X version with a a disabled
anyway it's quite clear that Vega 56
absolutely crushes the competition in
dirt for as it wastes the GTX 1080 and
was even able to beat the 1080 T is one
percent low result something else worth
noting here though is that with a a
disabled a few X is also five percent
faster than MSI's gtx 1070 gaming X
moving to the CMAA results shown a few
days ago we find similar margins with
anti-aliasing disabled or with CMA
enabled again we do see much the same
margins though the fury X now slips
behind the GTX 1070 now time for the 8 x
msaa results and wow things have changed
quite a bit
previously using CMAA vega 56 is one
percent low result was 38 percent higher
than that of the custom 1070 now though
it's 6 percent lower though it's still 5
percent faster for the average
that's a far cry from what we saw
previously it's been quite shocking to
see how much of an impact to these
various AAA modes can have on the
margins whichever way you slice it
though Vega 56 does well in dirt for it
just does incredibly well when using
CMAA
although I am yet to test with lower MSA
a-levels it looks like Vega does do well
at two times and even four times modes
based on some testing done by PC games
Hardware they found using four times MSA
a that Vega 56 was 20% fast and the GTX
1070 so it seems like Vega really only
loses its efficiency in this title
when using eight times MSA a anyway I
just wanted to clarify the results shown
in Monday's video as they did look very
out of place that said we know already
that the RS 580 beats the GTX 1060 by a
handy margin in dirt for at least when
using CMAA
so the results probably shouldn't have
been that surprising in fact as I was
wrapping this up I did actually go back
and have my dirt floor released a
results and here I was using four times
MSA a and as you can see the RX 580 is
20% faster than the GTX 1060 and not
much slower than the gtx 1070 moving on
to another topic i would like to discuss
a few viewers claimed that my results
were often that i've done something
wrong at vega 56 is indeed faster than
the gtx 1070 and every other review
showed this AMD themselves were also
quite surprised with my findings and
said vega 56 should have won now I'm not
getting my nose out of joint over these
comments they actually weren't that many
of them and I did openly admit that my
testing was a rushed though I am
confident in the numbers and I wouldn't
have risked my reputation by publishing
them if I wasn't but looking around the
net there are certainly mixed results
and opinions as there often are so I
thought it was worth looking into
honestly though looking at many of the
big trusted tech sites I felt like the
results I was showing were quite similar
at least the margins were anyway
Anandtech for example showed the same or
at least very similar margins in the
games that overlapped they tested nine
games and of those nine games I looked
at six of them dead overlapping titles
included dawn of war three total war
Warhammer Deus Ex mankind divided
battlefield one doom and Ghost Recon
wildlands they also tested with ashes of
the singularity f1 2016 and Grand Theft
Auto 5
now I dropped ashes of the singularity
because it's a pretty rubbish GPU
benchmark at least in my opinion I like
it for CPU testing but not so much for
GPU testing plus very few of you seem to
actually play that game or interested in
it I mean while I dropped GTA 5 at least
from that video because it heavily
favors the Green Team and it's not
really technically impressive anymore
especially from a GPU standpoint
unless you're moderate but we're
probably getting a bit carried away by
that point admittedly the game is still
hugely popular but it's also quite old
and I wanted to favor some more recently
released titles such as hell-blade then
we have f1 2016 and with limited time on
my hands for testing I dropped that game
because it's a bit of a pain to get
accurate results sometimes due to a few
issues with the game that required a
delete config files after every GPU or
Hardware change not a big deal but I
didn't have time to mess around with a
game that might give inaccurate results
anyway Anandtech tested those nine
titles which is absolutely fine however
their conclusion was quite different to
mine
they found Vega 56 to be on average 8%
fast on the gtx 1070 whereas i found it
to be 2% faster the reason for this
being that they did only test 9 games
and of those 9 games seven of them were
very favorable to AMD in fact if you
take my results from the six overlapping
games and then add their figures for GTA
5 f1 2016 ashes of singularity so the
games I didn't test we find the same 8%
margin they reported which is about as
consistent as it gets so if I tested the
9 games they did I would have also found
Vega 56 to be 8% faster and I probably
would have walked away much more pleased
with what I was seeing games such as
quake champions Mass Effect Andromeda
watchdogs to overwatch hell-blade
Dishonored 2 player unknowns
battlegrounds and Crysis 3 all during
the way the Green Team I ended up with
what I believed to be a more balanced
test basically in video 1 11 titles AMD
112 while we saw a tie-in just to titles
so you can see why results from one
review to another 10 vary quite a bit as
another example if an antic dropped GTA
5 they would have found Vega 56 to be
11% faster and now the margins are
really starting to come quite
significant so this is why we test with
so many games at harbor unboxed and I do
my best to
include new popular titles such as
player unknowns battlegrounds when I can
years ago I used to test with about a
dozen titles then I move to about say 16
no 18 that sort of became the norm and
now I find myself usually testing with
over 20 games to try and give you guys a
more complete picture anyway I don't
mean to single out an antique here those
guys do insanely awesome work and the
numbers are always spot-on it just comes
down to the spreader games tested now
while about five of the 1500 Plus
comments I received on my Vega 56 video
claim the results were wrong or fake
because other reviewers showed better
numbers many more upset that I tested
using a custom GeForce GTX 970 ideally I
would have liked to test with a gtx 1070
founder's edition as well as a custom
board partner models such as the msi gtx
1070 game ex which I did use however due
to limited time and we are always
managing how much time we have to invest
in these videos I could really only test
one so I went with the custom msi gtx
1070 gaming ex for a few reasons I'll
try to explain those reasons as best I
can but I certainly don't expect to
change the minds of those that disagree
with my choice and even then I
understand their point of view why if I
said a compromise had to be made
actually before I get into it I'm going
to take Paul's explanation I'm sure you
guys know Paul from Paul's hardware but
if you don't check it out Paul is one of
my absolute favorite tech tubers now
Paul use the galaxy gtx 1070 XOC model
despite the fact that AMD would have
much rather he used the founders Edition
the reasons he didn't use the EFI model
in his words is because there are many
more custom overclocked gtx 1070 s
available on the market may offer better
performance while sticking to the MSRP
and this is certainly true he also noted
the 1070 has been out for a year now and
that's also something I touched on if
the gtx 1070 was released a month or
maybe even two months ago then sure i'd
test the efi model because it would be
somewhat relevant especially if customer
clocked versions came in at a higher
price however as it stands the efi
versions actually cost more than the
custom board partner models and for good
measure it's slightly slower while
running much hotter and louder since day
one I've recommended highly recommended
my viewers avoid the founders Asian
models like the plague and the
and I got my hands on the custom blog
partner cards I stopped testing the FE
models entirely much too invidious
dismay now if AMD themselves agreed that
the reference Vega 56 is limiting the
GPUs performance which they certainly
haven't suggested then why release the
card in the first place it's not exactly
putting your best foot forward is it
rather why not do what they did with the
rx 518 have the board partners take care
of the cards design speaking of the
board partners I did talk with multiple
different partners and they all said
that custom value cards are nowhere to
be seen and don't expect to have models
anytime soon two different sources also
believe that for now AMD is writing so
low so that's quite interesting whether
or not this is true I I simply don't
know guys but it does sound like it will
be some time before we see the
availability of custom-designed vega
cards and if that is true that means
those researching Vega performance right
now with the intention of buying in the
next week or two will likely be buying a
reference Vega graphics card in my
opinion it would be misleading to show
that consumer gtx 1070 found edition
performance when in fact they were most
certainly be buying a custom gtx 1070
board partner card if they weren't to
buy Vega
anyway if custom bag of 56 models do
come out in the next few weeks or months
and they do offer 10% or maybe even more
performance over the reference card then
of course I will retest all 25 games
possibly even more and give you guys
up-to-date consumer advice for now
though it just seems like common sense
at least to me to compare products that
consumers will actually be purchasing
and I'm going to leave it at that
you certainly don't have to agree with
me but at least you now know the reason
why I tested the way I did whether they
agree with that or not
anyway that's going to do it for this
one there will be plenty more Vega
testing coming up on the channel like
what I do with rising I'll track Vegas
progress closely as new drivers games
and custom cards are released I'm your
host Steve see you next time guys
