video a big thank you to our sponsors
for making this year's Computex coverage
possible
check out courses fancy new RGB memory
and for a limited time purchase any
select msi Intel based motherboard or
gaming desktop and get a free game pack
worth up to $180 with titles such as
Warhammer vermintide 2 or X morph on
offer you can't go wrong check the link
in the video description to learn more
welcome back to harbor unboxed today we
are in the air oh cool sweet so it's
pretty cool setup they've got here and
they do have a lot of product to check
out we've got cases fans coolers few new
power supplies even some concept
products and some really cool desks so
let's go check those out right so the
first products we came across on our
tour of the Aero cool suite with the new
gaming desks and there are quite a few
different models that will be sold under
the Aero cool and thunder x3 brands
starting with the Aero cool versions we
have the 120 centimeter and 160
centimeter wide models and they are
available with or without the motor
mechanism for adjusting the height this
means that the base models feature fixed
legs wildly more expensive versions do
come with dual motors for adjusting the
height all models come with a huge
mousepad that covers the entire surface
of the desk and under the pad is a 25
millimeter thick particle board covered
in a waterproof plastic surface the disc
frame has been constructed from steel
and then given a black powder coating
finish all models also include a steel
draw as well then we have the Thunder x3
models and they're also quite similar
though they do offer a more aggressive
styling along with some eye candy in the
form of a wireless RGB light strip these
models though do away with the desk size
mousepad the motorized models do work
really well the control panel offers
manual up-and-down movement along with
for customizable presets it moved quite
quickly so you didn't have to wait too
long for it adjust to the next preset on
top of one of the display desks we
spotted the new glo case in white which
looked very striking this model is the
same as the black version and this means
there are two unique front mounted RGB
LED strips that line up the case and I
have to say the effect with the white
version is much more impressive when
compared to the previous version
the strip's can be set to one of 13
different lighting modes and this
includes six RGB flows and seven solid
colors the internal lat is a bit of a
blast from the past as the power supply
is mounted in the top this does seem to
make the internal layout of this mid
Tower appear a bit larger than it
probably would otherwise and I'm putting
this down to the fact that the three and
a half inch storage bays are also moved
up to the top of the case in total you
can install three three and a half inch
drives up to five two and a half inch
drives
there's loads of CPU and GPU clearance
as well and when it comes to cooling
there is just a single pre-installed
rear 120 millimeter fan that said you
can install an additional seven 120
millimeter fans if need be and there's
also room for a 240 millimeter rather
than the front a 360 millimeter right in
the bottom in total the case measures
210 millimeters wide 475 millimeters
tall and 478 millimeters deep while it
tips the scales at 8 kilograms overall
the new white version of the glo looks
much more impressive than the original
at least in my opinion moving on we
found a few interesting coolers one such
cooler is the hex add a tower style air
cooler with a thermal design power
rating of up to 170 watts the heatsink
base features what arrow calls heat
court touch technology basically what
this means is that the copper heat pipes
come in direct contact with the CPUs
heat spread up there are six copper heat
pipes in total at snake up into a large
array of black and nano coated fins the
fins feature a unique design which arrow
cool claims decreases air resistance by
up to 48 percent and increases air
intake by up to 37 percent the package
also includes a 120 millimeter orbit RGB
fan along with a top piece on the
heatsink which also comes complete with
RGB lighting they also have an
impressive-looking all-in-one liquid
cooler on display the pump housing for
this one does feature a transparent
window with a flow wheel and of course
next level RGB lighting but I have to
admit the RGB lighting on this one did
look pretty good they also had it on
display in a few different systems one
such system was the white edition glow
build there are also some new power
supplies on display but none of them
will be selling in Australia or the u.s.
at least at this point again the
flagship model packed plenty of RGB
goodness then lastly there are a few new
gaming chairs on display the fuse door
was one such model featuring a metal
frame adjustable backrest adjustable
armrests butterfly mechanism and more
although we don't have any official
pricing yet we were told that this will
be a reasonably affordable gaming chair
well that was a HIPAA call new products
and I think I'm gonna end the video here
because I found a very nice comfortable
position here in the beanbags and these
are also Aero cool products and we are
hoping to get some review samples of
these soon I'm not sure if they're gonna
send one for Tim and I but if it's only
one I'm getting it not Tim so Tim's
behind the camera there doesn't he
shaking his head at that one but anyway
we had a great time here the booth or
rather the suite was just really
impressive cool products hidden
everywhere saw some great new cases the
height adjustable desks were awesome
can't wait to see them get to market and
hopefully that's another thing we can
get a sample of and show you guys a bit
more detail about them anyway hope you
enjoyed the video like subscribe do all
that good stuff and we'll see you again
for another Computex related video real
soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
