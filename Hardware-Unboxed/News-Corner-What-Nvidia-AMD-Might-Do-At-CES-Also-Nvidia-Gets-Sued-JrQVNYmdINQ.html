corner in this pre CES edition we're
just starting to warm up into a big week
for announcements as CES kicks off in
the middle of next week
though there will be plenty of new
products getting unveiled along with
several keynotes in the days leading up
to the event in this week's news corner
we're going to talk a little bit about
what we expect to see at the show as
well as some other early product
announcements and a few other
interesting tidbits so the first of the
major CES keynotes is happening on
Sunday evening u.s. time with Nvidia CEO
Jensen Wang taking this stage it's here
that we expect NVIDIA to announce the
GeForce r-tx 2060 which at this point
well won't be much of a surprise there's
been plenty of leaks all over the place
for the past few weeks
everything from naming to rough
specifications to a few benchmarks to
packaging has basically been revealed at
this point we're expecting the ITX 2060
to pack 1920 cuda cores and 6 gigabytes
of gddr5 in rumors of up to 6 different
variants there or anything about exact
launch timing or pricing we've heard
some rumors about these things but you
know we just don't know right now we're
also not sure about reviews or anything
like that in normally Nvidia cuts it
pretty fine with us Australian so we're
not expecting to hear anything until the
very last minute we're also expecting a
video to talk about new mobile GPUs not
sure what form they'll take but we
should be seeing a new lineup based on
cheering and then there's also the
GeForce 11 Series we've seen some rumors
for products like the GTX 1160 but we're
not sure what's going on there some
sites have suggested this would be based
on a cheering tu1 1:6 GPU without the RT
or tensor cores but the name it does
seem a little strange there it'll be
interesting to see how that one plays
out Nvidia also likes to talk about
their data center AI deep learning and
automotive products so expect to hear a
lot about that stuff as well and of
course we'll have our thoughts on
whatever Nvidia announces shortly after
the keynote the other big keynote
scheduled for CES is from AMD and this
one it gues has been generating the most
excitement in the career I think a lot
of that is because people are expecting
big announcements for 3rd generation
rising
and Navi GPUs but as we I guess you'd
have to say controversially revealed a
while back neither of those product
lines will be getting unveiled or
announced at CES and they definitely
won't be launched or released as we said
in our last video on the topic we're
expecting Amb to deliver some teasers
and roadmap updates for Rison and Navi
similar to what the company did at
Computex for second generation thread
Ripper but if you're expecting you know
product names SKU specifications pricing
and all that sort of thing
I think you'd be pretty disappointed
with what the keynote is going to offer
a lot of people got very excited in the
past week as a Russian eariy tailor
posted up some listings for rise in 3000
series CPUs with clock speeds and
everything however our industry sources
were quick to inform us those listings
well they're not even placeholders
they're just full-blown rubbish
basically again I think the excitement
came from people assuming that if
retailers you know putting up
placeholders or early listings now then
AMD must be just about to unveil the
product stuck at say yes but as I just
mentioned that's really not going to
happen of course this isn't to say that
ambhi's keynote will be boring or devoid
of anything interesting what MD won't be
announcing Rison or Navi products the
way AMD tends to drip feed information
through teasers you know I can reveal a
lot when AMD first mentioned second gen
thread Ripper at Computex we got core
counts we've got a few demos other
tidbits but we didn't get any actual
product announcements and I think
something's similar to that at CES is
definitely on the cards we're also
expecting at least one actual product
announcement could it be a consumer 7
nanometre vega 2 part rumors of that
have been heating up in the last week or
so I'm also expecting plenty of
discussion on data center and AI
products plus the general state of seven
nanometers from AMD before CES we're
also set to hear more about
AMD's products in the mobile space so
stay tuned for that in a few days
aim DS keynote at CES is only an hour
long so they'll have to cram plenty of
stuff in and again we'll have our
thoughts on their announcements and
teasers later in the day mostly because
the keynote is at 4 a.m. local time for
us moving on CES is also a big time for
monitor announcements lots of companies
usually and found that only their you
know next-generation TVs at the show but
also their new monitors that they'll be
releasing throughout the year
first up we have Samsung who have
announced three new monitors without
giving a whole bunch of information the
biggest announcement of the bunch is the
CR g9 which is a 49 inch super ultra
wide display with a 50 120 by 1440
resolution and crucially a 120 Hertz
refresh rate we've already seen a few 50
120 by 1440 monitors on the market but
this is the first to push up to a 120
Hertz refresh rate which makes it a
great monitor for gamers at least
potentially at this size and resolution
we're looking at the equivalent of 2
27-inch 1440p monitors side-by-side so
that's you know the next step up from 38
40 by 1080 monitors that hit the market
over the last year or so the CR g9 is
also free Singh to HDR certified with
peak brightness up to a thousand it's
hopefully there's decent wide gamut and
local dimming support because if Samsung
gets both of those aspects right as well
we could have a decent HDR product on
our hands here Samsung also announced
the you r59 see a 32 inch curved 4k
monitor with a super slim design this
isn't a gaming display it's more
marketed towards content creators with
support for 1 billion colors then
there's also the Samsung space monitor
available in both 27 inch and 32 inch
sizes at a 4k resolution the key feature
to the space monitor is the clamp style
stand which can be positioned in a
number of angles gigabyte also set to
unveil their first gamma monitor
possibly for a release on January 16th
the company has been teasing this new
display on Twitter which likely means
their or ass monitor that leaked to read
it a few months back is coming quite
soon
while the Twitter posts don't reveal a
whole lot other than it will be a 10 bit
display they're not sure if it's native
10 bit the leaks indicate it's a 1440p
144 Hertz IPS monitor with free sync the
design is also reminiscent of ASA
predator and a soos ROG monitors for
better or worse then finally we have
some updates to the beza display HDR
specifications with the addition of
three new tiers two of the tiers are
specifically for older displays we have
display HDR 400 true black and display
HDR 500 true black these are very
similar to their display HDR standard
counterparts except with a few tweaks
specific to all the displays to match
their lower black levels and superior
transition times there have been a few
reports recent
suggesting that we may see a small
selection of OLED monitors come to
market in 2019 a few companies have
tried OLED monitors over the years but
issues like burnin have kept them from
coming I guess widely manufactured
potentially that could change though
especially now that there's despite HDR
tears accommodating all their panels the
other addition to display HDR is the
display HDR 500t which is basically
display HDR 600 but with a slightly
lower brightness target this
specification has been included for
laptop vendors which may struggle to hit
600 nits with a laptop display but may
otherwise hit the requirements of
display HDR 600 a couple of quicker
topics to round this episode out as
always and videos OC scanner now
supports Pascal GPUs you can access this
functionality through msi afterburner
version 4.6.1
previously this auto overclocking
feature was unavailable for chewing GPUs
but that has now been expanded to Pascal
and it's a pretty neat way to get more
performance out of your card without
performing a full overclock though we
still recommend you also overclock the
memory yourself as the OC scanner
doesn't touch memory some new Intel KF
Series CPUs have been listed at some
retailers and distributors the four
models in question are the core oh nine
9900 KF - cry 7 9700 KF Core i5 9600 KF
and Core i5 9400 F while the
specifications haven't been officially
confirmed by Intel the listings appear
to show identical specs to the regular
ngon F models but without an eye GPU
present having these F processors would
make you know a lot of senses many
system builders use and discrete GPU in
their PC anyway selling chips that have
a non-functional GPU will allow Intel to
get better yields rather than simply
throwing away an ant core CPU that's
otherwise fine no word on when these
chips will officially launch but it
sounds like it's not too far away final
topic of this week Nvidia is facing a
class-action lawsuit over the company's
alleged failure to properly manage the
cryptocurrency market decline the
california-based shor law firm claims
Nvidia made false and misleading
statements right into the company's
ability to sustain GPU sales after a
cryptocurrency crash the complaint
largely revolves around a specific
statement in william man at an investor
meeting where they said they are masters
managing our channel and that a drop-off
in demand among crypto miners would not
negatively affect the company due to
strong gaming cheap you demand however
as we now know NVIDIA ended up with a
significant excess of Pascal inventory
and then went on to launch during which
so far hasn't seen as much demand as
perhaps in video would have light
invidious stock price has collapsed as a
result Shore law firm advises that
investors who have suffered losses
greater than a hundred thousand dollars
and purchase shares between August 10
2017 and November 15 2018 should contact
the firm before February 19 2019 and
that's pretty much it for this one
we'll be back over the next week with a
few more news corner episodes as CES
