from Computex that was a fun week over
in Taiwan very you actually wasn't too
humid to be honest with you this year it
was rather cool and nice but certainly
warmer than the weather we have here in
Victoria at the moment anyway as I said
I am back I'm back in the studio I've
set everything back up hopefully the
audio is working of hit record on the
audio recorder hopefully I've done the
same on the camera otherwise this is
this is gonna be frustrating anyway I'm
not going to get up and check everything
cuz I'm sure I've got it right I can see
the light over there is a red for the
audio recorder so we've at least got
audio so if all else fails this will be
the world's weirdest podcast hey it is
an episode of unboxing boxes if you
haven't guessed already by the title and
the fact that I've got boxes the
unboxing on the desk but we're to get
into them I've got a couple of things
here not a whole lot of stuff really but
I know you guys get a bit upset if I
don't do one of these every month or so
it's probably a month since the last one
so yeah I thought I'd see what we got
here I actually don't really know what
any of this is I have a few ideas what's
in here because I actually asked for a
care package from PC case gear and those
guys er
those guys are really nice they always
look after me so they've sent something
over although they're trolling me either
way we've got something in this box
not really shorts in this one but we'll
probably start with these little
packages Iraq and get get these little
guys out of the way I've got two little
packages here and yeah not really what
we're dealing with here so we'll just
get into it I haven't got my trusty
knife what did I put that thing I hope
it's in here yep I've got my knife so
we're now in business let's get into
this how can I cut into it without
destroying what's inside
that's only paper it's probably just
ripped this but the knife's not really
necessary okay so we've got a red box at
the top there Sound Blaster
g6 I recognize this thing or something
very similar to this thing
well way back when Matt was still making
videos I'm pretty sure he looked at the
soundblaster xe5 I was gonna say g5 but
I feel like it was a 5 and that was like
a where are you going are you doing just
go up to it I swear he's moving is that
moving anyway
yeah a 5 it's a headphone amplifier
thing it was moving and this is a
high-res gaming deck and USB sound card
with headphone amplifier so that's kind
of cool
I suppose we'll take this out of the box
and have a look I might quickly look at
pricing information and stuff like that
well I'm cutting to some b-roll that
future me is no doubt going to do so
before we get too far into it for those
of you wondering this little guy here is
a hundred and fifty dollars us or two
hundred and thirty dollars Australian so
pretty pricey little item but this is
basically that actually I checked this
out on unboxing boxes the creative
soundblaster x-fi v' there's really nice
PCIe sound card got a lot of rave
reviews from everyone this is kind of
like that in a compact portable form
that can do a few extra things yeah I'm
not the first person to get one of these
they've actually been out for a while
now so I suppose creative just sent one
over to be featured on unboxing boxes
but from all the reviews I've read it
has excellent sound quality it's very
easy to set up and it works with a whole
range of devices so obviously it works
with PC or we wouldn't be looking at it
but it also works with a range of
consoles ps4 namely it also works on the
Xbox one but from what I've seen the ps4
setup is easier I don't know I'm a
complete console noob I don't use them
Tim sort of knows more about consoles
and I do because he actually plays on
them and it works on things like the
Nintendo switch as well but you can also
hook it up to your Android phone I
believe if you do that it kind of zaps
your phone battery a bit well it doesn't
work on Apple products but yeah whatever
but it works on Android devices so if
you want to have some really know
audio quality out of your phone for
whatever reason you can plug it into
this guy for game it has a scout mode
has a little button here you can change
from a few different modes but scout
mode is pretty handy so if you're a PC
gamer and your sound card in your laptop
or your PC or your integrated audio
rather is absolutely garbage then you
can use this as a USB sound card and
Scout modes pretty handy for hearing
footsteps and stuff like that it really
amplifiers that's what makes it a lot
easier to hear where other players are
so it gives you a bit of an advantage
there and it does have an individual mic
input and then of course your headphone
jack and the cool thing about this for
using high quality headphones your
audiophile grade headphones is that the
left and right channels are individually
amplified so it really improves audio
quality obviously I haven't tested it
out yet because I've just taken it out
of the box speaking of which what else
is in the box so you get an optical
cable there is a USB cable so that is
micro USB little bag or do not eat well
so we've got and then just the
instruction manuals and I'll sort of
stuff but yeah I'll give this a bit of a
go later on and I'll let you guys know
what I think of it but yeah pretty
pretty cool little device we really
liked the e5 so yeah I imagine this is
just better because it can do more
things okay next up we'll skip that for
a moment I'm not sure what that is I'm
pretty certain this isn't asrock
motherboard I bet you guys are hoping it
2x 570 board it's definitely not going
to be an X 570 board because those will
still be under NDA but I suspect to give
it a shape that it is a motherboard
could be a graphics card but yeah why be
a graphics card okay the motherboard is
it's a gaming seven phantom gaming 7z
390 it's kind of a thin but large
surface area box so suppose we'll take a
peek inside
it's interesting that we're still
getting some refreshed
zette at 390 motherboards this late in
the game I didn't really end up doing
all the said 390 verum thermal testing
that I would like to because well
product releases started happening and I
got caught up with other stuff but I
still have I think there's about four or
five boards I have tested I haven't
released that data so yeah if you guys
are still interested in more Zed 390 vrm
thermal information let me know I
suppose I can put that video together
and I could probably add this board to
it as well so I will get this board out
and take a bit of a look I feel like
with the recent AMD announcement I
didn't want to talk too much about Zen
to processors in this video but I feel
like with the recent announcement of
that series most people would be holding
off on building any kind of new PC at
this point in time I think we'd be
wanting to see what the X 570 boards are
like especially since they'll be priced
in a similar category to the Z 390
boards and then of course as always
processors so I don't know how many of
you guys will be keen to buy and 99 or
okay at this point in time not saying
that those n processors will be better
than the 99 or okay but we just don't
know at this point so yeah whether you
just want to wait or a month but anyway
regardless we have this board it was
sent to me before Computex but just
enough time to check it out before then
and obviously I won't have time to test
it so yeah I don't know how much
interest there'll be and vrm thermal
testing for Xen 390 motherboards and the
future we already have a bit of data but
like I said I've tested a few boards and
I haven't given you guys that info
anyway this particular board as far as I
can tell it is an eight phase-- v core
vrm so it takes four signals and it
doubles them so yeah that makes it a
genuine eight phase-- vrm isn't using
the highest quality components though
they are technically better than what
you'll find on the tai chi though I
believe the total current capacity is
about the same so it's an eight plus two
design it uses the is l69 138 controller
so again that's an eight phase-- pwm
controller it uses the SI c63 for power
Sage's they are 50 amp power stages and
then they're doubled using ISL six six
one seven a doubles so that's pretty
much the vom configuration for this
board pretty typical looking aluminium
heat sinks nothing too special there and
yeah it looks like it's a reasonable vrm
but nothing yeah nothing amazing like I
said it should be similar to the Tai Chi
which is certainly quite good but the
board does cost I think at the moment
it's selling for a hundred and ninety
five dollars u.s. and there's no current
prices for Australians because well it's
not selling in the Australian market yet
so yeah it's going to be around that
$200 u.s. mark those sort of boards that
will be competing with so that puts it
up against the Auris elite and that's I
think that's one hundred and
seventy-five dollars the elite board and
I have to say that board would have a
better verum because it has a six phase
while it's got a twelve phase but it's
six phases that are doubled and it's
using higher quality components so yeah
this doesn't bring anything too new to
the table but yeah overall a decent
board it's got some nice features
there's 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet all the
standard sort of USB stuff you'd expect
to find so yeah nothing too over the top
but it is a really nice-looking but I do
like the new sort of gaming phantom
gaming look I think the boards look
pretty cool
it's got some new sort of RGB lighting
features and stuff like that but yeah
overall I don't think it's too
game-changing at this point in time as
it has quite interesting that we are
seeing some new Zed 390 motherboards
this late but maybe that's Intel giving
motherboard manufacturers multiple
vendors some incentives to create a bit
of excitement around the platform since
everyone's getting pretty excited for
Zen too so Intel doing what they can I
do like how the i/o shields now are
coming pre-installed on a lot of these
boards I'm not sure who starred that
whether it was a sous or gigabyte not
sure anyway as rocker doing it now and
yeah it looks pretty good okay that's
the Zed 390 phantom gaming seven all
right we'll get this little package out
of the way it's kind of sticky huh that
was a shipping label
it's probably a white sticky it's the
best way to open this without destroying
what's inside ah looks like we have a
Razer product the basilisk essential I
believe that's how it's pronounced I
haven't actually looked at this mouse
bland or ware of it it's quite a popular
mouse at least the original one was well
whip it out and take a look quite a neat
little box but then it is just a mouse I
suppose so there's no need to go too
over the top with it what sort of
throwing stuff out everywhere okay so
it's got a neat braided cable standard
green or Razer USB connector on the end
and yeah it looks quite similar to the
original nice and light yeah it's
certainly very comfortable obviously I
can't tell you too much about it but I'm
just gonna go quickly check a few things
out okay well obviously I haven't really
plugged it in and done too much with it
yet but I have done a little bit of
research so I can give you a bit of an
overview so it's not just a hey I've
taken it out of the box and here it is
which is kind of what we do an unboxing
boxes and anyway this is well it's an
the essential versions are the cheaper
more affordable versions of the original
products so obviously to sell something
cheaper some compromises have to be made
in this instance the 16,000 dpi sensor
that's been downgraded to a 6400 dpi
sensor which for most gamers is fine but
it is quite a significant downgrade all
the same you're also missing at the DPI
button the up and down DPI button so now
it's just a single button which means
you have to cycle so if you go past the
step that you want you have to go
through all the steps again so it's a
little a little less practical it's kind
of annoying if you hit it mid game
because then you've got to quickly cycle
through to where you would like it to be
so up-and-down is handy there so you
give up that that's the only button
missing though and then only sort of the
logo here is backlit so the wheel is no
longer lit so yeah I mean if you care
about lighting on the mouse I suppose
that's a bit of a downgrade there and
apparently on the original version you
can adjust the wheel tension so
it's just fixed on this model and the
interchangeable thumb switches and now
but are no longer interchangeable so
there's a few down grades there and I
guess well it depends on how much it
costs us to whether or not those down
grades can be justified or not and in
the Australian market it certainly can't
be because it costs the same amount as
the original I don't know how that works
but yeah this is I think it's $80
Australian and that's how much the
original the non-essentials version
costs so that kind of makes this product
really pointless in our market at least
for now it's meant to be about $10 u.s.
cheaper I think I couldn't really get
any clearer info on that it's five
dollars cheaper on Newegg and ten
dollars cheaper on Amazon so that's the
biggest pricing discrepancy I could find
was what we saw in Amazon so yeah kind
of a weird one that I don't know if
pricing is just got to settle but if
it's $10 u.s. less it still makes it
pretty competitively priced for what
it's competing with but I think I'd
rather to spend $10 u.s. more and get
the the original one with the better
sensor the extra lighting zone the extra
button and all that sort of stuff I
think for $10 it's probably worth doing
but they wait there's more options now
so if you want to save you 5 to $10 u.s.
then you can and you can get this model
here but anyway I'm interested to see
what you guys think about this mouse in
the comment section below is that
noticeably cheaper in your region is
that the same price as it appears to be
Australia and yeah would you consider
buying this over the original or save
well anywhere from nothing to $10 okay
let me let me know what you guys think
in the comment section below
so we're not doing super well
boxing boxes for this episode we've sort
of come across a mouse that I'm not
entirely sure why it exists and a
motherboard that probably doesn't need
to exist either so let's hope there's
something exciting in this box
can't even get the plastic you do
anything exciting okay what do we have
here we have some $1 I'm assuming it's a
data because it looks very $1 ish xpg
that's this their stuff I have a doubter
a tiny font on the back so yeah they're
they're branding is not very prominent
on this but whatever it's their xpg
series and it's their spectryx D 60 G
ddr4 RGB memory so that's pretty cool I
haven't seen this stuff before it looks
pretty fancy actually emotive no we
didn't say this at Computex I didn't
actually head over to the a data booth
we didn't have time but it's a 16
gigabyte kit of ddr4 3000 what is the
timings probably like sales 16 or
something 16 18 18 I will do my best to
get some b-roll of this stuff all lit up
and doing probably the default rainbow
effect so you guys can judge yourselves
on whether or not you think it looks
anything good yeah it looks like itll
are a lot of it will light up so it
should look pretty spectacular from the
top and the sides but yeah hopefully it
looked good
yeah I I'll have to see when I make the
b-roll and eventually edit it into this
video but it looks like the effect will
be quite in your face so if you like
very flamboyant memory and then maybe
this will be the stuff for you anyway
we'll move along well you want hang
around on the RGB memory for truline
alright the last box here is the biggest
box and I kind of can see what's in you
know one of the things anyway I don't
think this is I think there's just one
thing
Oh a PC case key airbags make a bit more
of a bang not for that okay that looks
interesting what else we got in here
that looks interesting
Oh plenty of PC case key have delivered
of the woods okay we'll start with the
ducky keyboard this is the ducky one too
many what have I got here the speeds
which is cool and yeah we haven't we
don't really do keyboard reviews on how
our box but I have looked at some ducky
keyboards in the past and I've actually
used ducky keyboards in the past they
are exceptionally high quality very much
enjoyed the ones I've used in the past
and this guy is a cute little ducky
keyboard so that is the key to pull hard
well my kids are gonna want that thing
but there's no way I'm letting them use
it so as far as I know PC case key are
the only retailer in Australia to sell
this particular model so I've got some
sort of special deal with ducky or no
one else has brought them in yet but
yeah if you want one of these you have
to go through PC case key and it is 150
dollars ozzie I did have a look on
Amazon and Newegg
it's not available there so I don't know
if you can get it in the US or if you
can where you have to get it so no idea
on that one
so this particular model comes with the
Cherry MX speed switch is it's actually
the Cherry MX RGB so it's their RGB
switches designed specifically for RGB
lighting but you can also get it with
the more traditional black we've got
black blue red and brown I think that's
all of them you can also get them with a
red silent switch so yeah the speed one
that's not you're not super loud but
yeah they're make they sell up
mechanical keys it's a really solid
feeling little keyboard this thing to be
pretty awesome for gaming actually so
we've got a custom sort of fancy looking
ducky spacebar key cap then we've got
some yellowish keycaps we can see we've
already got the enter key that you can
change that back to the black one if you
want
there's a few different profiles there
and your up/down keys and then a couple
of yeah fancy keys anyway and the cool
thing about this actually that was one
thing the mouse didn't have that was a
downer on the mouth that doesn't have a
detachable USB cable so if you end up
damaging the USB cable or whatever that
kind of rights the mouse stuff unless
you're pretty handy with with wiring oh
that's just dude no all right the hard
way so we just have a USB type-c to a
standard type a connector and there's
your cable so you can change that to a
braided cable or a different color cable
if you would like to otherwise yeah this
rubberized cable will do the job
perfectly fine yeah it's a really
awesome little keyboard the only thing I
have to have with keyboards is like a
wrist rest so you can probably use like
a gel pad wrist rest or something for
this I suppose the point is to be really
compact so having a big wrist rest
hanging off it kind of defeats the
purpose on that one but yeah it's a it's
a really nice keyboard quality seems to
be very good I'm keen to give this a bit
of a whirl later but I feel like this
will be pretty popular amongst gamers it
actually would have been really handy to
take two Computex actually this is what
I might take the Computex next year
because it's really good to type on and
perfect for those little desks you get
in hotels so yeah anyway I'll give it a
test later on and I'll let you guys know
in the comments what I want to think
about it oh there's a there's a key cap
changer included a little ducky one so
that's nice okay next thing on our list
is the be quiet dark rock slim again I
couldn't find this on sale in the US it
is a pretty new cooler yeah it is pretty
new it's only a few months old I think
at this point so there are plenty of
reviews on it if you're interested and
from what I can see it performs very
well and it's extremely quiet so that's
good
it's $89 Australian I got a PC case key
probably should plug them since they
sent it to me
but yeah no idea because it wasn't on
Amazon or new egg
hey wait we'll take a quick look at it
and then we'll move on so it says
clearly on the box 180 what the TDP
and apparently it can dissipate or I can
handle CPU Raider with a hundred eighty
watt TDP with making just like I think
it was twenty three point six maybe
anyway it's around twenty three decibels
which is basically silent you're not
going to figure that over anything else
in your system so that's pretty
impressive because one hundred eighty
watt TDP yeah it'll handle pretty
high-end processes you should be able to
deal with something like the 99er okay
without a problem you can see that the
base plate on it is quite small so it's
designed to for you Rison and then your
Intel processor that will take sky like
X that'll do twenty sixty six socket
processors won't do TR for not
surprising because yeah that's not gonna
go well on a TR four socket but yeah the
point is its slim as the name suggests
so you will have clearance with your
memory actually I can probably give a
demonstration with this motherboard I'm
not sure how good it's going to be so it
goes on like that you can imagine
they'll be a fan and you can see how
much clearer there is there to those
four dimm slots so yeah the name of the
game with this one is cool quiet and
very compatible and you can put a fan on
both sides the fin design on that side
looks very cool
no pun intended so you get a silent
wings three fan so it's got the
interesting looking fan blades meant to
be super quiet and based on the specs it
will be so you can also put another 120
millimeter fan on the other side too so
you can have it a push-pull
configuration that will enhance
performance if you want to do that but
obviously you have to buy another fan if
that's what you want to do I also really
like this brushed aluminum top cover
that's really nice gives it a really
clean look and it'll look great in your
case and of course it does cover the top
of the heat pipes which can be quite
ugly so yeah it's cool partner looks
nice I quite like it of course I really
like the anodized black fence
crit II mean looking cooler this one and
I'm actually pretty keen to see
outperform as I when PC case Keys head
they've got this new cool alright yeah
said I'll take a look at that because
I'm keen to start doing some air cooler
testing and
all they want liquid cooler testing
we've done a little bit of it in the
past not a whole lot and yeah I thought
it'd be something we could start adding
to the mix of things that we do so if
you guys are interested start seeing
some air cooler tests from us on Intel
and AMD processors then yeah let me know
in the comments section below and that's
something we can start doing but anyway
that is that is that will move on to the
next item okay now this next one is
quite interesting I've read mixed
reviews about these things I didn't
actually ask the guys at PC case Q what
their experience has been like with
these I probably should have done that
but they are I offered to send it over
what okay wait wait click the trigger
again yeah they offered to send it over
to take a look at 4 unboxing boxes and
I'm pretty intrigued so this is the x3
hurricane it's what Canlis air system
basically you can recharge it I don't
know how many times it's like 400 or
something so that's the battery inside
and when you pull trigger it blasts air
out so you can use it to clean your
system it's basically like a compressed
air can but you can use it over and over
again so it'll save you a lot of money
and a lot of wasted cans I suppose I
should talk about the price it is a
hundred and fifty dollars u.s. so yeah
you'll have to use a lot of cans of
compressed air to make your money back
not a stupid amount if you're using them
fairly regularly it'll should pay for
itself but it is 240 Australian dollars
so yeah it's quite pricey for Aussie
viewers you can get a pretty impressive
air compressor for two hundred and forty
dollars and if you're just cleaning out
computer cases and whatnot well yeah
that'll probably do a better job to be
honest with you I haven't really read
the manual on the fittings but they're
not super easy to attach just let me see
if I'm doing this wrong okay there's no
manual on how to attach the fittings so
it should be pretty self-explanatory you
would have thought okay well I can get
that one on there but that's pretty
close how much
okay it's pretty loud okay so right away
I can tell you it's nowhere near as
strong as an air compressor so I'll have
to give it a proper go obviously and try
and dust out a dusty system so after try
and find one of those first but on
initial impressions it seems pretty weak
for 250 ozzie I have to be honest with
you guys I'd be expecting something much
much more powerful than this thing a
cheap $50 air compressed like the real
cheap nasty ones you get from hardware
stores they don't know how reliable
they're I bought I think I've bought two
of them over time and I've still got
them they are significantly more
impressive in well blowing air out of
them so yeah I I'm not sold on this $250
and all that does is it just sort of
blows air that's it you can't really
pump up balls with it you can't pump up
tyres as far as I'm aware you certainly
wouldn't need something like this with
an air compressor because well the air
pressure is just so great that yeah it
blows everything apart if you if you're
basically needing to scrub something
it's going to be need to be much more
substantial on one of these but anyway
yeah initial impressions not super
impressed so yeah like I said I'll give
it a go and see what it's what it's
really like but I would only use it for
sort of light stuff anyway like I said
I'll test it out and I'll get back to
you guys but for the money yeah what do
we got here
so what is this oh okay
so this looks to be a data vac so this
is a bit more impressive I think so this
guy here runs off mains power so not as
portable but likely to be significantly
more powerful so although this one isn't
cordless it is significantly better in
terms of pricing you can get it for just
83 dollars u.s. or 170 dollars
Australian I don't know 70 dollars
Australian is still a bit pricey like I
said you can get a decent entry level
type air compressor deal like one of the
bigger air compressors is obviously not
as portable as this but they're about
well you can easily get them for $100 so
there's $70 cheaper than this and again
you can blow up balls tires run power
tools off them if you want to air tools
all that sort of stuff so these are
really just for pumping out air well see
how well let's see how well this one
works
okay so right away I can tell you this
is miles better than this miles better
it's also I would say it's a lot easier
on your ears as well this thing has a
high-pitched squeal to it kind of like
10,000 laptops trying to render a video
whereas this is
just kind of like a vacuum cleaner or a
powerful vacuum cleaner so yeah and it
pumps out significantly more air this
will actually clean out a case quite
well don't offer to rival an air
compressor air compressors a kind of
overkill really for cleaning out dust
that's what I use anyway and they are
quite good but yeah this would
definitely get the job done and it's
certainly more portable than an air
compressor of course if you've got a
hose from your air compressor and it's
nearby then I suppose that's very
portable because it's just up a hose and
you can get in places whereas this is a
bit more bulky and cumbersome to get
into places and blow air out of but yeah
are these two products of initial
impressions there's no way I'd be buying
this for over this even if it was half
the price I don't think I'd waste my
time with it like I said I'll still give
it a go and see what it can do but yeah
not impressed this thing looks like it
will actually clean your PC out
reasonably well and not waste your time
so that's good but yeah you sort of have
to weigh up what you want if you just
want something that can blow large
volumes of air then sure this this is
pretty good at doing that buy that
certainly seems to be but if you want
something that's a bit more versatile
you can use it for yeah blowing up bowls
tires running any kind of air tools
things like that then I'd probably just
get yourself an air compressor because
it will be cheaper and yeah if you have
that on your back deck or wherever it's
pretty handy because personally I
wouldn't use this inside anyway you're
not going to get a computer and blast
all the dust out inside because then
you've just moved it from one place to
somewhere else inside so that's not
particularly useful so you'd be taking
this outside anyway so you're gonna need
somewhere to plug it in so not not
massively more convenient than an air
compressor but anyway I've probably
waffled on enough about things that blow
air and yeah that's that's my initial
impressions on these I don't mind this
one I think this one is a is somewhat
useful and of course it comes with your
static wrist band so you why
well static discharge so you won't
damage any components on your PCs and
whatnot you don't get that with an air
compressor at least not typically but
yeah this isn't a wireless to respond so
yeah anyway that brings us to the end of
this episode of unboxing boxes wasn't
the most exciting episode we've ever
done but yeah hopefully the if you're
looking at getting either one of these
hopefully that helped I yeah avoid that
one get this one or look at an air
compressor if you need to do other
things with it
if you want any more details or my
thoughts and that kind of stuff yeah
happy to answer them in the comment
section below let me know if you want to
see us start doing a lot of in-depth
testing on air coolers and liquid
coolers because we can we can do that
let me know if you want to see all that
extra Zedd 390 vrm stuff I can throw a
video together they're a bit time
youichi when you're put together but I
can do that
like I said I've done a lot of the
testing but yeah there's still a bit
time we shereena put together keen to
play with the ducky that looks like an
awesome little keyboard I'm going to
make sure my kids don't take that one
cuz yeah they'd love that and yeah
that's gonna do it for this one I have
some awesome benchmarks coming up so
don't worry I have been very very very
busy benchmarking so I think in about
two days from now there'll be some
evidence of that I've got a really
really cool video planned and they'll
just be the usual content from us and
then we'll be getting into all the new
products but anyway
that's gonna do it for this one thank
you for watching I'm your host Steve
like subscribe do all that stuff I'll
see you again next time
