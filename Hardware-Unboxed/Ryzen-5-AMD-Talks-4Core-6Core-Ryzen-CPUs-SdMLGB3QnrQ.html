today I have an update for you regarding
AMD's upcoming rising 5 CPUs that they
are announcing well right now there are
just basic details given in this press
release and I have put a few questions
to AMD but they weren't keen to answer
all of them I assume they want to keep
some things a secret for when the rise
in 5 CPUs are officially launched
therefore it looks like today and be
really just announcing the actual risin
5 models so the model names and their
out-of-the-box specifications as well as
the all-important pricing so right away
AMD made it clear that the rise in 5
series will be targeting the sub $300
u.s. cpu market so no surprises there
they want to explain that twice as many
people purchase CPUs within this price
range and again that's not really
surprising
AMD believes that rise in 5 will shake
up this market segment though by
offering a better price to performance
ratio than their competitor for gamers
and content creators and I have to say I
agree with them because risin 5 will
feature both 6 core and 4 core parts
featuring SMT support sitting at the
head of the rise and 5 family will be
the 1600 X which boasts 6 cores and 12
threads the same configuration is
Intel's Core i7 6800 K it will operate
at a base clock speed of 3.6 gigahertz
and a boost clock of 4 gigahertz of
course like all rise and see if you use
its unlocked though given what we've
seen from risin 7 I don't imagine you
about a squeeze too much more out of
this processor AMD says that the 1600 X
will be almost 70% faster than the core
i5 7600 K when measuring multi-threaded
performance in Cinebench though that's
not totally surprising as it does have
two more physical cores plus those six
threads
along with this 1600 X there will be a
second 6 core part known simply as the
1600 basically the 1600 comes clocked
400 megahertz lower but is again a
completely unlocked part so that
shouldn't really matter as is the case
with the 1700 X and 1700 it's likely
that the 1600 will be a much better buy
than the 1600 X though where is less of
a price gap between these two parts when
compared to the
seven models but I'll get to that
shortly then we have the four core parts
which also support eight threads the
rise in six 1500 X and 1400
interestingly out of the box these parts
are clocked even lower the 1500 X
operates at a base clock of 3.5
gigahertz with a boost clock of 3.7
gigahertz meanwhile the 1400 runs at
just 3 point 2 gigahertz and will only
boost as high as 3.4 you hurt out of the
box of course once again though these
are both unlocked parts so hopefully
they will be able to run on all cores at
at least 4 gigahertz for those wondering
the 1500 X and 1600 will ship with the
Wraith spire cooler while the 1400 comes
with the smaller Wraith stealth cooler
now for pricing the 1600 X comes in at
250 dollars u.s. which prices it
alongside the core i5 7600 K that said
we suspect that you will be better off
buying the standard 1600 which cost $30
less at 220 dollars those wanting to
spend less than $200 have the 1500 X 190
dollars and the 1400 at 170 dollars
these quad-core parts are coming up
against the locked core i5s as well as
the more expensive core i3 s such as the
unlocked
7350 k which costs 170 dollars and we
know that to be fairly terrible value so
without even testing we know that the
Rison v 1400 already has Intel's entire
cable 8 core i3 range begging for mercy
while the locked core i5 models will be
trembling in the corner try not to draw
any attention so the 1400 really is
going to be the superstar here and if it
can hit at least 4 gigahertz on all
cores then I think it's safe to say this
is going to be 2017 s best value sub
$200 CPU and tool rise in three lands in
the second half of the year Intel's
budget hero the pentium g 4560 will
remain safe and well in command of the
sub $100 price point right so that
pretty much covers everything in the
press deck what AMD didn't cover though
is how the CCX units within the horizon
5 processors will be configured and also
the cash amount so how that
configuration will impact how much level
3 cache in particular the cpus have on
offer they did confirm though when I
asked if the
five CPUs were physically the same as
the Rison seven with just certain cause
/ threads disabled and they said that
yes that is the case so that means that
the Rison five processes will have to
CCX units under the hood
just as the Rison 7 models do what isn't
clear right now is how they will be
configured perhaps someone else managed
to get this information out of AMD but
at this point I haven't actually been
able to get any solid information on how
the CPUs will be configured for now I'm
guessing that the six core parts will
feature one core disabled in each CCX
rather than one fully enabled CCX with a
second featuring to cause enabled that
said the latter option might be better
for gaming though it would be a little
odd for the level 3 cache
speaking of cache in this scenario would
see the six core parts still equipped
with a total of 16 megabytes of level 3
moving to the quad-core parts it makes
sense that AMD simply shuts off an
entire cc X and this would be the
optimal solution for gaming I can't
imagine that would keep both CCX units
enabled with just two cores enabled in
each CC X that would see the quad core
parts retain the full 16 megabyte level
3 cache but the crosstalk between CC X
units would likely hurt gaming
performance so in the end I see the
horizon 5 quad core supporting an 8 mega
byte level 3 cache half that of the 6
core and 8 core parts it's also still
not clear whether or not the disabled
cause and the rise and 5 parts will be
physically disabled from the CX or if
they simply turned off in the microcode
or the bios this is always exciting
stuff for enthusiasts as it means in the
future once yields improve to the point
where bidding is more for product
segmentation rather than physical
defects it could be possible to buy a 6
core or even the full core part and
enable up to 8 cores with a little bit
of tinkering just imagine 1,800 X
Performance for $700 us yeah I know I'm
dreaming and I'm just teasing you guys
in the process so I'm gonna stop so
enough speculating enough dreaming it
shouldn't be too long now till I have
probably all 4 rise in 5 CPUs in hand
and I can show you guys exactly what
they're all about so with that I'm going
to get back to benchmarking horizon 7
there's still plenty of work to be done
on that front I'm actually working on
right now and hopefully if I can work
laid enough tonight I'll be able to wrap
it up and get the video out tomorrow
afternoon a Windows 7 vs. Windows 10
rise in gaming performance comparison
because it's a bit of a hot topic now
and a lot of people are suggesting that
Windows 7 gaming performance with
horizon is a lot better than Windows 10
so I thought I'd look into that test
quite a few games and try and get to the
bottom of it so that should be pretty
interesting and then next week I'm also
on the sidelines working on another
video which will be tight and XP SLI
testing at 4k comparing horizon to some
sort of Intel system whether it's the
7700 K or 69 or okay or both we'll see
how much time I get to do that but it'll
be at least one of them oh yeah that
should be pretty interesting to see how
the Titan XP cards stale on both
platforms and the Titan XP well they're
still ridiculous or unrealistic cards
because that $1200 u.s. price tag the
performance they produce now is more
realistic you know you know it's more
obtainable now because we have the 1080p
i/o cards which are much cheaper though
at $1,400 u.s. for the pair they're
still not that wallet-friendly but I'm
sure to be guys looking at buying them
anyway and it gives us an indication of
how 4k gaming performance in the future
might look on these platforms with more
powerful graphics cards but that's a
whole nother thing because games can be
better optimized for eyes and in
performance could change but look at the
here and now I'm rambling
anyway I'm gonna wrap this up before I
keep going on because there are a lot
more cool things that I could talk about
that are upcoming on the channel but
you'll see those in due time anyway
that's all for now I'm your host Steve
thanks for watching I hope to catch you
guys again real soon real soon real soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
