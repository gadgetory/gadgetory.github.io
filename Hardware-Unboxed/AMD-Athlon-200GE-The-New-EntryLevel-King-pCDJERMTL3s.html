Corsair and their impressive new hydro
series h100 I Pro all-in-one liquid
cooler armed with a 240 millimeter
radiator and a pair of ML series
magnetic levitation bearing fans it runs
cool and quiet
we've been using the slightly larger 280
millimeter versions for many months now
in our test systems and I found them to
work very well with the latest AMD and
Intel processors so check the link in
the video description to learn more
welcome back to our unbox today we are
taking a look at the new ofon 200 GE
AMD's most affordable zen based
processor yet
Tim covered the specs in detail about a
week ago now so rather than dig into all
that again I'll just provide a link to
that video if you're interested to find
out anything that wasn't mentioned in
this video and that said I will go over
all the important stuff again stuff like
the core count for example and that's
kind of a big one though Rison is
typically known for packing many many
cores and we still have seen some quad
core variants such as the horizon 3 1200
and more recently the 2200 g the Athlon
200 GE though well that's a dual-core
but before you shriek louder than the
coil whine of a cheap graphics card
consider the price this is a $55 u.s.
processor and again it is a Zen based
processor
you also get SMT enabled so although it
is a dual core it does support for
threads so it's kind of like a
traditional core i3 then and like
traditional core i3 it's also locked yep
AMD is now locking desktop processors
Tim did discuss this and gave our
opinion on the subject in the news story
last week and before the end of this
video I'm going to touch on this again
discuss it a bit further and also
discuss some interesting feedback we got
from some of the viewers anyway here's a
quick speedrun the two cores are clocked
at 3.2 gigahertz there's five megabytes
of cache in total the integrator radio
and GPU packs just three compute units
and the TDP rating has been set at just
35 watts AMD is claiming pentium g 45 60
light performance which by today's
standards isn't great it has to be said
but also not bad for just fifty-five
dollars
and the fact that it's on the am4
platform certainly doesn't hurt either
AMD also claims that the integrated GPU
isn't nearly as useless as it sounds on
paper
despite packing over 60% of fewer
compute units when compared to the 2200
g that said the Athlon energy is perfect
for students casual gamers using a
family pc for browsing the interwebs
firing off emails and doing homework
whatever that last one is so anyway it's
a dirt cheap Zen CPU that can take
advantage of existing am4 motherboards
you can either buy a dirt cheap and
frankly direct quality a320 motherboard
and build the ultimate brand new budget
banger or you can stick it in a slightly
more expensive but world's better be 350
or be 450 motherboard and after saving a
dollar a day for a year upgrade to the
Rison 720 700 X and in the process
upgrade from a casual gamer to a
full-time basement dweller since I am a
neck deep in GeForce r-tx testing right
now and that content will be on the
channel tomorrow I didn't have too much
time to spend on this one that's it I
think I have done enough testing so yeah
hopefully it's okay before we move on to
the testing I should just quickly touch
on the name as it is quite different to
the rise and we've seen Plast and
everything for the last year or so
despite the Athlon name though what we
have here is quite familiar
it's a Raven Ridge apu basically the
2400 G with two cores lopped off oh and
almost a quarter of the integrated GPU
but it does come in at a third of the
price so all that being the case we are
already familiar with the technology and
architecture ok so let's get on with the
testing now AMD did suggest in their
slides that you could overclock the
memory with this part turns out that was
a mistake and you cut which explains why
I'm a gigabyte a B 350 and gaming Wi-Fi
board I was stuck at ddr4 2666 so that
means the Athlon to energy will be
tested with ddr4 2666 as that is the
maximum memory frequency supported the
2200 g and 2500 g worked fine with ddr4
3,200 memory so that is what I tested
them with for comparison we have a heap
of budget CPUs from AMD and Intel
there's also some integrated GPU testing
a for comparison I've thrown in some
older discrete graphics cards as well
and
we have some power and temperature
results as well as a simulated overclock
to see what we're missing out on so
without wasting any more time let's get
into it using ddr4 2666 memory which is
what we are forced to use with the
Athlon 200 GE we see a memory bandwidth
of roughly 29 gigabytes per second which
is comparable to the core i3 8100 when
compared to Xen based processors using
ddr4 2933 memory we see that the balance
has been reduced by about 15 percent and
this larger than expected margin is down
to the lower core clock speed moving on
a cinnamon char 15 and we find a very
dual core with SMT like score of 360
points
this made the Turner G around 6% slower
than the Pentium G 4560 and 13% slower
we're looking at single core performance
and similar margins were seen when
compared to the Pentium G 5400 so as
expected this $55 process I won't be
blowing any socks off but it is
considerably better than any of the
budget bulldozer offerings on the a m4
platform such as the $110 us a 12 900
that we reviewed last year next up we
have the corona benchmark and here that
200 G was 10% sold in the pentium g 4560
a massive 31 percent faster than the a12
900 it was also a 32 percent slower than
the Rison 320 200 G so that a great
result overall but given the price not a
bad result either now these results are
important particularly if you run any
workloads that take advantage of AVX
instructions as these instruction set
isn't supported by the pentium g 45 60
or g 5400 as a result the 200 g was 24
percent faster than g 45 60 in this test
giving the Athlon chip a massive
advantage in AVX workloads moving on a
7-zip and we find that for compression
work the Athlon 200 G isn't going to be
spinning our archives at an impressive
rate as here it was 6% slower than the
Pentium G 45 60 it was 12% faster than
the slow a 12 900 so that's something
then when it comes to decompression
performance the to energy is comparable
to the core i3 70 100 and Rison 3 1200
thanks to its SMT support next up we
have some excel results and here the
Athlon 2 energy was almost
20% slower for the pentium g 45 60 that
was 33% faster than the a12 900 so as
expected not a beast in Excel but for
most users it will be capable enough the
200 GE also comes in just behind the
pentium g 45 60 and PC mark 10 office
modern benchmark which is a little
disappointing we would have liked to see
some improvement over the early 2017
budget CPU King in this test but that
wasn't to be as for power consumption
well the Athlon to energy really is in a
league of its own seeing total system
consumption peak at just 52 watts the
rise in 322 energy test system using the
same power supply consumes 75% more
power while the G 45 60 consumed 44
percent more power of course the
comparison with the a12 900 is just
absolutely ridiculous the bulldozer
based CPU push total system consumption
three times higher then when gaming the
Athlon 200g consumed a similar level of
power to that of the pentium g 4560 but
as you're about to see destroyed it when
comparing integrated GPU performance so
here we're comparing a number of
processors with integrated GPUs as well
as some older discrete graphics cards
that you can buy in our second hand for
pretty much pocket change
please note all the script graphics
cards have been tested on the core i3
8100 using 16 gigabytes of ddr4 2500
memory then for comparison the Rison 320
200 G and risin 5 2400 G have been
paired with 16 gigabytes of ddr4 3200
memory and then the Athlon 200 G with 8
gigabytes of ddr4 2666 as you can see
the 200 G was good for an average of
just 32 FPS at 720p use in the medium
quality settings and disappointingly
this made at 27% slower than the a12 900
and although the Athlon part does
feature a new and GPU architecture it
has far fewer cores available so we're
going to find some mixed performance
when compared to the a12 900 still
what's important here for AMD is that
the turnigy smoke to the core i3 8100
and pentium g 4560 in stark contrast to
what we're seeing when testing with
Fortnight the 200g crushes the a12 900
in
front to the game was even playable at
720p using the lowest quality settings
so that's something it certainly wasn't
using the core i3 8100 or Pentium G 4560
testing with Counter Strike global
Offensive sees the turnigy slip back
behind the aid 12900 though it was 41%
faster than the G 4560 then we see the
two energy crushing the G 45 60 and the
8100 in dota 2 using the highest quality
settings at 720p and I imagine using low
quality settings that will allow you to
push the frame rates up over 60 FPS
performance in overwatch was also decent
using the medium quality preset and here
the turnigy offered a little over 30%
more performance than the 812 982
percent more than the g 45 60 as is
often the case with entry-level
solutions we find that when testing with
pub G it's really a no-go and that's
certainly the case with the 200 GE here
we're only seeing core i3 8100 live
performance which is very disappointing
but then it is pub G so who's surprised
rocket League is very playable at 720p
use in the highest quality settings so
gaming at 1080p with reduced quality
will be possible
the Turner GU managed to edge out the
a12 900 and crushed the G 45 60 finally
we have Rainbow six siege and here the -
energy comes in well behind the a12 900
at least for the average framerate still
we do see playable performance and this
wasn't the case with the pentium of g
4560 before wrapping up the testing i
wanted to investigate what might have
been using the 2400 G and the Wraith
stealth I disabled two cores and
unlocked the two remaining cause with
SMT enabled at 3.9 yoghurts
basically this gives us an unlocked 200
GE but with a better integrated GPU but
we're not testing that so it doesn't
really matter so what we have here is a
22% CPU overclock
from 3.2 gigahertz to 3.9 gigahertz
this boosted the single core performance
by exactly 22 percent in Cinebench r15
while we see the multi-threaded score
increased by 18 percent that's certainly
nothing to sneeze at
and it means if unlocked the Turner GE
would have absolutely destroyed Intel
sub $100 CPU range being the Pentium G
45 60 while costing much less
so that is a shame but before we do well
on that let's wrap things up with some
temperature testing just a quick note on
temperatures I didn't get too into it
here because I don't actually have the
official Box cooler so these aren't
official results because I got an early
sample it was an OEM tray CPU and not a
retail version with the Box cooler so
for testing I tried out the Wraith
stealth and found an idle temperature of
29 degrees and a load temp of just 49
degrees also through on the passive
Arctic Alpine a m4 heat sink which is
designed to handle up to 47 what AMD
processes completely passively with no
fan given the - energy is a 35 watt
processor I thought this would be the
perfect time to test this cooler out
with zero airflow and I mean absolutely
zero airflow apart from whatever air
movement we had in the room I saw an
idle temp of 34 degrees with a load temp
of 74 degrees
not bad again given that there was no
direct airflow okay so in a nutshell
AMD's new Athlon at 200g is okay it's
not great just okay
certainly doesn't redefine the
entry-level desktop CPU space like the
pentium g 45 60 did back in early 2017
for example and that's a shame because
it very easily could have still if it
does indeed come in at the suggested $55
u.s. price then it will be the go-to
budget CP on my opinion so I suppose in
that sense mission accomplished for AMD
and the pentium g 5400 is meant to cost
$64 us and many months ago now it was
available at that price but with intel's
current production issues and that price
has swelled to over $70 u.s. out of any
places cost more than $80 so in light of
intel's recent problems that appears AMD
has really done enough with the turnigy
again that is assuming that it comes in
at the suggested or retail price at best
the G 5400 on an h3 10 motherboard will
set you back $130 us meanwhile the 200 G
on an a320 board that we typically
recommend a 320 board so I suppose it is
a locked processor but anyway I won't
get into that at the moment that combo
200 g plus a 320 board you're looking at
about 105 dollars so not a massive
saving there
but we are talking about entry-level
hardware so I suppose every dollar does
count for the most part the Pentium G
5400 is slightly faster for office and
general usage but when it comes to
casual gaming the to energy is
significantly better also if your
workload takes advantage of a VX then
the Athlon chip is much faster so as I
said the Athlon at 200 GE is a better
value choice overall but it's a lot
closer or the battle is much closer than
it really needs to be especially for
tech savvy budget builders had AMD not
locked the 200 GE and giving you guys
the ability to boost performance by 15
or 20 percent then it really would be a
no-brainer
after all Intel has been caught with
their pants down quite literally
actually at least that was the story
regarding their former CEO which is
quite funny when you think about it like
that but seriously AMD needs to kick
Intel while they're down and I'm not an
AMD fanboy rooting for AMD to destroy
and tell any nonsense like that it's
just that AMD are coming from so bloody
far back they can't afford to pull
punches like this and they've missed a
golden opportunity to completely
annihilate Intel at the low end and make
the a m4 platform without question at
the only choice for budget shoppers that
said as I alluded to earlier they have a
bit of luck on their side on this one
because Intel are currently facing those
supply issues and that is pushing prices
up of all SCP use including entry-level
parts and that makes the 200 GE a lot
more appealing than Pentium @g 5400 now
yeah previous video the one done by Tim
where we kind of slammed AMD for the
decision to lock the Athlon 200 GE and
this was an opinion that both Tim and
myself shared I have to admit I was a
bit gobsmacked by the response of quite
a few viewers it's almost like you can't
criticize AMD for anything these days
and it's not going to result in anything
good for any of us
admittedly a lot of the negative
comments were from viewers who didn't
seem to quite understand what we really
meant they claimed things like AMD was
locking the to energy to limit power
consumption and make it more efficient
also make it
cheaper to produce hide the fact that it
probably can't overclock very well
AMD doesn't want to risk cannibalizing
the 2200 G that was one we heard quite a
bit even though we said that wouldn't be
a thing and overclocking motherboards
are too expensive and there was a few
other things but stuff along those lines
in my opinion and I suppose
Tim's opinion we feel all those points
are wrong or just don't really make any
sense at all our locking the 200 GE has
no impact on power consumption at all
unlocked the results would be exactly
the same so that is to say out of the
box anyway before you overclock and then
your power consumption will go up costs
AMD nothing to unlock the CPU so not
sure where that one comes from locked
unlocked it doesn't change anything
about the production of the CPU as for
being poor overclockers there's really
no way the 200 GE so some people were
suggesting that it's the base clock is
at just 3.2 gigahertz because it really
can't handle much more than that because
it's a really low end crap CPU that's
Bend and while there could be some truth
in that that's not a particularly great
bit of silicon there's no way that 3.2
gigahertz is the sort of cutoff for the
majority of the chips I'd say you go
quite a bit higher than that chances are
most will probably do up around 3.8
maybe 3.8 seems like a good spot that
most of them would probably do and that
is a nineteen percent frequency bump
even at 3.6 you're looking at
double-digit gains so also where does
overclocking meant to be guaranteed yeah
bit of a weed one that I don't
understand the logic behind that
argument it would almost do my opinion
make the 200 GE kind of a bit more a bit
more exciting a bit of a it was always
cool in the old days when you'd get a
chip that just overclocked like crazy
but a lot of them didn't that was that
was kind of the whole exciting part of
our clocking I kind of missed that these
days where they all sort of yeah you add
the multiplier but does that and so
anyway I don't know how you could
complain about even it was only 200
Hertz I don't know how you could
complain about a free 200 overclock it's
better than being locked in my opinion
so yeah you should really only be upset
with having no chance to
tract any extra performance which is the
situation we face with the 200 GE as for
cannibalizing the horizon 320 200g well
again Tim said that that wouldn't happen
in the previous video but that seemed to
be a common they came up a lot but as we
just saw in these simulated overclocking
benchmarks that was just never gonna
happen thanks to its 4 physical cores
the 2000 G was still 30% faster than the
overclocked at 200 G simulation and of
course you still can overclock the 2200
G as that is an unlocked processor and
you can squeeze a bit more performance
out of it
and it's probably worth noting the Rison
3 processor is also vastly superior in
terms of integrated graphics performance
so I suppose the real question is why
has aimed a locked the Athlon 200 GE
well I actually asked Amy this directly
and asked them to get back with an
official response and by the time I got
around to film this video I hadn't got
an official response if I have I'll put
that as a pin comment down below not
that I was really expecting them to
admit the real reason because in my
opinion the real reason is that they
plan to somewhat follow in intel's
footsteps by heavily segmenting the
market so later this year you'll see an
Athlon to 20 g and an Athlon to 40 g
released at slightly higher price points
with a small bump in frequency you had
the 200 G been an unlocked part then
there would be absolutely no reason to
buy these upcoming processors as you
were just overclock to match their spec
so it seems aimed he was worried about
cannibalizing some of their products it
was just price that they are yet to
release and I feel like this is a bit of
a slap in the face for budget builders
has aimed at primarily targeting
businesses it seems with this new CPU
and businesses won't be overclocking so
if the 240 GE for example is better in
terms of value or whatever then
businesses would just buy that they
won't simply buy the 200 G to save a
couple of bucks and then overclock it
it's just not going to happen but that's
something many of you will certainly do
and now you don't have the ability to do
that so yeah it'll be shame and just
quickly to wrap that up a lot of people
hug you'd that another reason why they
locked that CPU is because they are
primarily targeting businesses and OMS
and whatever and therefore it makes
sense to have locked it because
they don't overclock again I don't
really understand the logic because it
costs them nothing to lock it and
businesses aren't going to have a clock
so they're not going to cannibalize the
220 and the 240 GE and all they're doing
is upsetting guys that are tech savvy
and do their research and want to
overclock and spend ten dollars more to
be 350 board so again I don't really get
the thinking behind that so yeah this is
why I was a bit gobsmacked over the
response from quite a few viewers
viewers who I have to imagine our tech
enthusiasts I kind of get that there is
no shortage of AMD fanboys not trying to
upset anyone it just that seems to be
the case and they do defend the red team
at every turn but you're not really
doing anyone any favors don't look out
for AMD look out for you guys the
consumers and I get it I've read a
little comments no Intel sucks they lock
all their processes they've heavily
segmented the market and they bleed you
for every last dollar yeah it's all true
for the whole hey so why are you willing
to give AMD a pass when they attempt to
do the same thing I'm not saying AMD
you're going full-blown intel on us but
if we allow them to take this step and
then the next step or the next step and
yes so some of rationalize this by
saying oh it's only the Athlon 200g
who's gonna overclock that anyway well
without a tree it'll be 2019 before you
know it aimed he may have climbed to the
top and will be looking around thinking
not too much has changed here at that
point we'll be bitching and moaning
about AMD locking all their most premium
CPUs using toothpaste to transfer heat
away from the dyes locking down almost
every single one of their chipsets and
whatever else it is that we've been
bitching and moaning about Intel for the
past decade also while I'm in this rare
ranting mood probably due to the
complete lack of sleep over the past few
days due to those r-tx cards let's talk
about the a12 9800 an old friend of mine
to think some people tried to defend
that abomination when we called it out
for the garbage it is sure the Athlon
200g has arrived a year later but even
back when I reviewed the a12 900 for the
first time this time last year mind you
it was just a horrible purchase five
months later we got the
I use the proper ap use for the airport
platform and for the same price that
2200 G absolutely decimated the a12 900
I didn't really make much of a deal or
bring it up then I just thought out
whatever we'll just move on with that
but yeah the 200 GE thing with the
overclocking kind of stirred me up so
here I am on my rant but anyway yeah a
year later the turnigy is coming at half
the price and delivering usually better
or at least similar performance to the
a12 900 at a fraction of the power
consumption and heat output that being
the case I feel like the to energy is a
quality placeholder if that's what you
wanted to use it for but anything
bulldozer based not so much
anyway wrapping this up as I said the
Athlon turnigy is a decent CPU and at
the suggested price will be our new
go-to ultra entry-level option that said
if you can throw $50 more at your CPU
purchase the risin 322 energy is a
significantly better product so keep
that in mind and with that I'm going to
end this one sorry about that conclusion
I know it felt like it was just never
going to end but it is ending now I
