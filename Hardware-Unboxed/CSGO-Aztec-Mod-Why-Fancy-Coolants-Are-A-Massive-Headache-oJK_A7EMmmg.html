have another awesome custom modded build
series from Alex of simple mods not one
but two custom rigs will be created in
this video and Alex also ran into a bit
of a coolant disaster with one of them
which he'll show you guys so with that
I'm gonna hand it over
Alex he'll explain a little bit more
about the builds why he's doing them all
all that stuff and then of course show
you what went wrong hey what's going on
guys Alex here and it's great to be back
with another video this time I've got
two systems to show you as I've built
two identical cooler master cosmos c7 GP
systems one a normal ATX form factor and
the other in Reverse thurbert csgo tuned
with the orange system representing
terrorists and the blue system
representing the counter-terrorist team
now other than the obvious color choices
there are more slight csgo aspects found
inside the two builds and I'll let you
guys spot these out however the main
team is based on the Aztec map I thought
integrating the Mayan patterns with
computer hardware and water cooling is
going to look great and I really like
the way both builds have turned out two
systems were sponsored by Intel for the
Intel Extreme Masters event in Sydney
last month where they were the showpiece
systems found on the simple mods case
bottom boot where I had quite a few of
my modern systems on display and also
hence why the csgo themed worked
perfectly for these two builds let us
know in the comments if you attended the
event and maybe checked out the book
other than the insanely large cooler
master cosmos system on GP cases the two
systems have identical specs featuring
an Intel Core i 970 900 X processor on
an ace used ROG Strix X $2.99 a gaming
motherboard with 32 gigs of team group
Nighthawk RGB 32 hundred megahertz ddr4
Ram a 512 gigabyte Intel 760 p.m. dot to
SSD as the main OS drive a 2 terabyte
Seagate Fire CUDA sshd and they whopping
12 terabytes Seagate Barracuda pro hard
drive and also it not to forget to a
soos ROG Strix GT X 1080 graphics cards
running in sli this is all being powered
by the cooler master V 1200 watt power
supply with awesome cable my prior
custom sleeved cables in order called
exclusively using bits power I am using
mayhem Zora orange
coolant in the orange build of course
and this is the very first type of
Oracle and from mayhem
I had two unopened bottles for years and
I'm surprised at how well it's been
holding up even more than a month after
the show and I've been using this rig
quite regularly with no issue so I'm
definitely impressed however in the blue
system I did initially have the new
premature View coolant which
unfortunately had a bad reaction with
the acrylic on the water block so I'm
100% sure what happened but I know it
was a nightmare to flush and clean out
so it definitely wasn't a great
experience as you'll see however that's
not to certain appreciate what pretty
much you are offering with their view
coolant I've used other colours in the
past with no issues at all now I'll
continue to use and experiment with this
coolant plus their new Prima prep blue
prep is meant to improve things with
view and it's actually now bundled with
view bottles being sold from premature
however keeping in mind that if you're
not an experienced user when it comes to
custom water cooling you may want to
avoid these types of stroke coolants if
you don't want something like this to
happen to you as well anyways guys I
hope you enjoyed the time-lapse video
and of course the two finished builds as
well and I'll see you in the next one
Cheers
well I hope you enjoyed those builds by
Alex was pretty awesome stuff and it was
great to see him able to cram a couple
of weeks work into 20 minutes and show
you guys the process from start to
finish I always find that really
interesting I'll include a link in the
video description to go check out Alex's
channel simple mod so make sure you do
that as well and that is going to do it
for this one we have plenty more content
coming up later in the week so stay
tuned for all that and i'll catch again
soon
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
