another episode of what does it take to
play now last time we checked out prey
and for that title the risin 5 1400
coupled with the geforce gtx 1050 Ti
worked out very nicely at ADP this time
however we're going to check out four
and again we're looking at 1080p
targeting around 60fps I do really enjoy
the odd racing simulator when I get time
to play them and I have spent a bit of
time over the years playing the various
dirt titles in the series so I'm keen to
give this latest version a shot as the
game was just released yesterday I
believe that's when I got into it I had
much time to enjoy the game while really
play it too much and the footage shown
in this video was recorded with me
playing with a keyboard rather than a
game controller or even better a
steering wheel so far the games been
very well received scoring a 9 out of 10
or better at major publications while
gamers themselves seem to be giving it
at least an 8 out of 10 so good stuff to
do it for I think this is because the
game does a good job of catering to a
wide range of skill levels and there's a
diverse range of cars and game modes to
mess around with visually the game is
very good that said it's not amazing
graphically it won't impress like
project cars did upon release for
example but it's certainly not great
overdue at rally there is a good level
of graphical customization as well but
sadly the built-in benchmark that was so
good for helping users determine if the
settings would allow for smooth gameplay
on the system doesn't exist in this
version as it has in the previous few
versions so that's disappointing anyway
based on my testing so far I recommend
the following new hardware for getting
the most bang for your buck in dirt 4
for the CPU the pentium g 4560 worked a
treat rarely did utilization reach 70%
and was for the most part found hovering
around 50 to 60% the system was also
configured with a gigabytes of ddr4 2400
memory for the graphics card I played
around with a few options here mostly
focusing on the geforce gtx 1063
gigabyte and raid
rx5 seventy four gigabyte those were
quite similar for the most part though I
did notice that the 1063 gigabyte drops
it down to lower frame rates more often
making the rx 570 my preferred choice
for this title
here's a quick side-by-side comparison
between the rx 570 and GTX 1063 gigabyte
before moving on exclusively to the rx
570 footage with the G 4560 running the
show
No
you need to believe and remove your face

affinity to stop take it up to the
marshal
Oh
well they have it for a smooth 1080p
experience using the ultra quality
preset which does enable four times msaa
I recommend the RX 570 coupled with the
G 45 60 as you've seen the game isn't
particularly demanding on the CPU
you will want at least four threads for
this title and that's exactly what the
super affordable G 45 60 offers of
course if you can't afford something a
bit more substantial at the Rison v 1400
which packs 8 threads that's going to be
a better option but having said that
don't expect to deliver much in the way
of extra performance when playing direct
for especially if you're using a
mid-range GPU the game is also quite
light on memory usage it's certainly not
a memory pig with the rx 570 installed
we saw only 4 gigabytes of RAM allocated
and by Ram I do mean system memory that
figured get increased to almost 5
gigabytes with the 3 gigabyte GTX 1060
installed as the smaller via Ram buffer
on this graphics card was forcing some
game assets in the system memory so that
coupled with the fact that I was using
the G 45 60 processor with 8 gigabytes
of ddr4 2400 memory is probably the
reason why the 1060 suffered more severe
frame drops using a more powerful CPU
with higher frequency memory would no
doubt help to mask the 1063 gigabytes
shortcomings for those of you who'd like
to see a heap more graphics cards
benchmarked as well as additional
resolutions but I have some good news
for you next week I will be delivering a
much more in-depth to dirt 4 benchmark
video that does exactly that covering
all the current and previous generation
GPUs for now though the good news for PC
gamers is that dirt 4 appears very well
optimized and with a few tweaks will
still look very good while enabling the
game to play on entry-level Hardware at
least modern entry-level Hardware anyway
that's going to do it for this one I'm
your host Steve see you again soon guys
