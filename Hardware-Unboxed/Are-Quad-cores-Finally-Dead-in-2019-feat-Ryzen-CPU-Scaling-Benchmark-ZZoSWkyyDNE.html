are discussing quad-core processors
namely how relevant they are in 2019 now
the last time I covered this topic was
back in 2017 and recently quite a few of
you have been referring to that video
asking me if I can revisit this subject
in create an updated 2019 version the
2017 version was purely a discussion
piece there were no new benchmarks at
the time as I pretty much done all the
testing that was necessary to discuss
whether quad cores were worth it in 2017
recently though the channel focus has
mostly been on GPUs and I suppose
understandably so with the release of
Nvidia Tsar txseries the RX 590 Radeon 7
and the newly released geforce gtx 1660
TI the quad core cpu discussion in my
opinion is far less relevant than it was
back in 2017 for the simple fact that
there's no longer a top-tier cpu that
only features 4 cause the most expensive
quad core sold today is the core i3
8350 k and we wrote that thing off that
day it was released today it's priced
just over $200 and you'd be bonkers to
spend much over $100 on it then from AMD
we have the horizon 3 1300 X which you
can also ignored you to pricing the r3
1200 is far more sensible at $90 though
we suggest budget shoppers look at the r
320 200 G which is currently just five
to ten dollars more and offers a decent
integrated graphics solution those of
you shopping for a budget Intel CPU
should be looking at the core i3 8100
but at 125 dollars u.s. my opinion is
that the horizon 322 energy is a far
better value option anyway the point of
this video is to explore if these budget
quad-core CPUs are worth buying today
for gamers or are they dead on arrival I
was going to explore how the core i5
7200 K is faring in 2019 but once I
started getting into that testing I felt
like it was probably an observer to own
video as there was just a whole lot more
I had to do I really had to test the
horizon 5 1600 as well it wasn't really
worth just including the 70 season or
okay so perhaps in the near future I can
do an updated Core i5
nisi Turner kV vs. Verizon v 1600
comparison let me know down in the
comments section below if that's
something you want to see happen anyway
quickly while touching on the 7600 okay
back in 2017 I said the following as
much as I like the rise in cpus the 70
she's going to wreak a is arguably
better right now for the vast majority
of gamers out there you can certainly
find titles where the Rison v 1600 is
faster and will no doubt end up being
the superior cpu down the track but most
DirectX 11 titles play better with the
higher clocked quad-core having said
that I wouldn't buy the 70 singer okay
I'd get the rise in v 1600 which is not
only cheaper but also supports
overclocking on more affordable
motherboards and it ships with a decent
cooler so just to make it clear to all
the AMD fans out there back in 2017 we
weren't recommending the 7600 K but I
also didn't agree with the claim that
quad-core CPUs were dead like some
people were claiming at the time what
does quad cores are dead even mean to me
it means new games either a refused to
load when attempting to run with a fork
or CPU or be run so poorly that the
games simply not playable thus far the
first point hasn't yet happened all
games that I'm aware of will execute and
run on a quad-core processor as for the
second point it's still quite rare to
find a title it's unplayable on a
quad-core it might not be the best
experience going around but it's always
very playable granted you certainly
wouldn't want to be paying mid-range or
higher end money for a fork or CPU but
as an entry level gaming option in 2019
I believe they're still perfectly fine
for this video I'm going to explore CPU
scaling performance using AMD Zen based
processors I've got a few games to go
over and I'd like to take a closer look
at a few different configurations using
shut off the Tomb Raider please note the
GPU used for each test is labeled on the
graph as are the resolution and quality
settings the horizon processors were
tested with ddr4 3200 CL 14 memory while
the Athlon 200 G uses ddr4 2400 CL 14
memory starting with Rainbow six siege
we have the horizon 320 200 G
representing the
four core four threaded CPUs and we see
a few interesting things here firstly at
1080p for those seeking big frame rates
the quad core is still very punchy in
this title alone from 183 FPS on average
with over 129 FPS at all times that's at
a dual core processor with SMT enabled
also allowed for very playable
performance still whereas we saw the
2200 trailing the 2700 X by 28% margin
at 1080p that figure is reduced to just
13% at 1440p and then 9% at 4k in fact
even the Athlon 200g is able to deliver
a similar gaming experience at 4k that
said this won't be the case for all
games for example let's take a look at
project cars to testing with project
cars 2 showed pretty consistent
performance gains as we increase the
core count again the quad-core Rison 320
trilogy still enabled play performance
attorney P never dipping below 60fps but
when using a high end GPU it is clearly
creating a system bottleneck we see
basically the same scaling at 1440p as
well and it's not until we hit 4k that
the r-tx 20 atti becomes the limiting
component for most of these
configurations in fact at 4k it's only
the dual-core Athlon 200g that can't
keep up for testing with hitman I've
used the DirectX 12 API and I've
selected an NPC heavy scene this
basically crushed the dual-core
processor at the point where it was
unplayable effectively killing it in
this title then we have the quad core 20
20 G and it's right on the edge with a
1% low of 33 FPS however we do see a 70%
variance between the 1% alone average
frame rate at the 22 energy whereas the
2500 G which supports SMT only saw a 31%
variance what this suggests is that the
22 energy wasn't as smooth and this is
certainly what I saw when testing
Assassin's Creed Odyssey is another cpu
demanding title and here we see with the
dual-core Athlon 200 g it really
struggles to provide playable
performance the 2200 G on the other hand
while not ideal it did provide playable
performance and we found it 4 K that it
was comparable to the four core 820 400
G making it slightly slower than the
Rison 5 2600 now I've deliberately
included force for horizon for because
like a lot of games it's not very CPU
in fact it plays perfectly fun on a
modern dual core processor and we see
that here when looking at the Athlon 200
GE truth is the vast majority of games
aren't that CPU demanding especially the
popular eSports titles that said it is
extremely frustrating when gamers run
into CPU bounce scenarios which is why
gamers talk about CPU performance so
much a super demanding new title is shut
off the Tomb Raider here we find the
quad-core 22 RG right on the edge and
again the disparity between the 1% low
and average frame rate is much greater
than what we see with the 2400 G even at
the 4k resolution the 22 energy is
massively limiting performance of the
r-tx 20 atti and that suggests to me
that this cpu will limit performance of
much lower end GPUs as well so let's
explore that now ok so here we've
changed up things quite a bit by adding
the RT X 2060 and GTX 1066 gigabyte also
please note while all GPUs have been
tested using Tim's optimised graphics
profile the resolution does vary for
example the 2080 - I was tested at 4k
the r-tx
2060 at 1440p and then the 1066 gigabyte
at 1080p what's interesting to note here
is that the Athlon 200 G in Rison 320
turnigy limited frame rates across the
board this is one of the reasons why we
test CPUs with high-end GPUs to remove
the GPU as a potential system bottleneck
and while you might say pairing a 2200 G
with the 2080 Ti is unrealistic it
better informs you of the CPUs limits
and chances are with a lower and GP
you'll still find those limits anyway
with appropriately adjusted quality
settings anyway what we see here is that
across the board the Athlon 200 G and
rise in 3:22 energy are limiting
performance and the same is also true
for the 2400 G finally for an additional
test I took the geforce gtx 1660 TI and
benchmarked at 1440p
using the lowest medium and highest
quality presets again just in the highly
demanding shot of the Tomb Raider
the point of this test is to further
illustrate just how difficult it is to
cover this topic even with multiple
hardware configurations using the
highest quality preset the margin
between the 2700 x 2600 X and 2400 G is
reasonably small the 2200 G does well
for the average framerate but I
we've seen numerous times already lags
behind for the 1% low result this is of
course seen again with the medium
quality preset and then is exaggerated
even further with the lowest quality
preset we also find the limits of the
2400 G here as well so even though we
can increase the average framerate
performance of the GTX 16 60 TI by 48
percent with the 20 20 G by going from
the highest to lowest quality preset the
one percent low performance which is
heavily CPU limited is improved by just
27 percent in the case of the 2600 X and
2,700 X we do see consistent scaling for
both the 1% lo and average frame rates
as we're not CPU bound for those
configurations so a quad-core CPUs dead
in 2019 sounds like a simple question
but simply answering yes or no that
would be to oversimplify what is really
a complex question I think we can all
agree that high end or even mid-range
quad-core CPUs even those with SMT
support are dead if not for the fact
that neither AMD nor Intel has produced
a quad-core processor at least a
mid-range a high-end one for over a year
now but because they can limit
performance in a number of modern tiles
as we've just seen Intel's current
mid-range protesters packed 6 cores with
6 threads while AMD's pack 6 cores with
12 threads
this means 2017 s quad core Core i5 77
RK which was priced at $240 u.s. really
is a thing of the past and I think for
today's market $100 quad cores are
perfectly fine especially for those
gaming with an Rx 5 65 70 at GTX 10:50
right to a 3 gigabyte 1060 a cheap quad
core really will get you by there that
said I'd suggest aiming for at least the
$165 rise in 5 2600 but I can also
completely understand that spending that
extra cash isn't an option for everyone
generally speaking those buying $300
plus graphics cards aren't looking at
pairing them with a $100 CPU of course I
don't doubt that sort of thing happens
but it's not the norm getting back to
the core i5 7600 K for a moment I
realize that the quad core performance
shown in this video doesn't really
reflect what the Intel 7th gen quad core
cable eight-part can deliver
we've seen in the past that the 7600 K
really does lay waste to the 2200 G but
like I said in its day it did cost twice
as much so there's probably no surprises
there but even so in more modern titles
such as battlefield 5 multiplayer the
the 76 honorary K really will start to
struggle there though I suspect a heavy
overclock with some decent memory will
still be enough to get you out of
trouble for now I guess the point here
is that not all quad cores are created
equally some can be overclocked around 5
gigahertz off a high IPC and low latency
others come at much more modest clock
speeds perhaps don't support the same
memory bandwidth latency and so on on
that note again I am keen to pitch the
core i5 7600 K against the Rison 5 1600
and a huge range of games to see which
processor offers the best gaming
experience in 2019 so keep an eye out
for that content then finally we have
the games themselves and then the
quality settings used if by chance
you're mostly playing non CPU intensive
tunnels such as Forza horizon for Ghost
Recon wildlands dirt for fortnight for
honor what else World of Tanks probably
newer games such as Metro Exodus dirt
rally 2.0 and even apex legends they
look as though from my early testing
that a modern quad core with a mid-range
GPU will work just fine however if
you're playing the battlefield
multiplayer games a hitman the
Assassin's Creed series or something
like shut off the Tomb Raider for
example a mid-range to low-end quad-core
CPU such as the Rison 322 rog is really
gonna struggle for the most part these
games will still be playable the results
will just be a little less than
desirable
so in short quad cores are perfectly
fine as entry-level parts and thankfully
today that's all they're being sold as
at the mid range and beyond I suppose
they are dead suppose you could say that
and ideally you would want a 6 core 12
threaded CPU as a minimum and it's
probably going to be true for at least
the next few years anyway that is going
to do it for this one if you did enjoy
