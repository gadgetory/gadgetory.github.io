processor in the last decade or so for
me the AMD or Intel will know their
bundle a basic cooling solution with
their processors I say basic cooler
because they're low-cost products now
such features simplistic designs to be
fair both companies are limited in what
they can offer due to compatibility
requirements large coolers won't suit
all systems and the heavier a cooler the
more complex the mounting hardware needs
to be for most users the standard box
cooler does a good enough job
they aren't outrageously loud and they
have proven to be very reliable
enthusiasts on the other hand leave the
Box cooler where it belongs in the Box
given the chance they would probably
throw it in the trash but the cooler is
often required for warranty purposes
anyway realizing that enthusiasts aren't
going to use to stop cooler in Telus
admitted it completely from their kei
processor packages while AMD felt it
unnecessary to include their stock
cooler with the silicon melting base
that is the FX 95 90 currently AMD
equips its FX series processors
excluding the FX 95 90 with a rather
small air cooler known internally as the
AMD d3 the d3 heatsink is made of
aluminium and features four copper heat
pipes on tops it's a 70 millimeter fan
which can and will make itself well
known under load the modest box cooler
can dissipate up to 125 watts of heat
though in order to do so it does make it
uncomfortable hovercraft
s51 deser bells given processors such as
the FX 83 seventies boast a thermal
design power rating of 125 watts they
have no trouble pushing the d3 to its
limits for this reason the bulk of AMD's
FX customers look to alternative
solutions and there's a wealth of
options out there spending an additional
$50 or so and a high performance air
cooler isn't too much of a stretch when
you're already dropping two hundred and
forty dollars on an FX 95 90 however
most of AMD's fans invest in the cheaper
more cost-effective FX processors such
as the $140 8320
which can be overclocked by at least
1,000 megahertz there are 30 to $40
options and
pretty decent overclocks on the FX 8320
there is still this increases the total
cost by 20 to 30 percent and that puts
consumers within striking range of a
Haswell core i5 some news that came out
of AMD recently suggested that they're
looking to solve this issue at least to
some degree anyway the word is AMD plans
to provide better quality coolers with
their processes going forward and today
on hand we have evidence of just this
called the wraith which i have to say is
a fair bit cooler than d3 this new
thermal solution can be used on existing
and future AMD processors like the d3
the wraith is only rated for 125 watts
of heat but it does have some notable
upgrades firstly the aluminium heatsink
is much larger named he tells us the
wraith features 24 percent more surface
area in which to dissipate heat again
there are four copper heat pipes but
this time they're aided by a larger
eighty millimeter fan which provides up
to 34 percent more airflow or generating
less than 1/10 the noise Andy claims the
80 millimeter fan moves 41.6 CFM aver
with a maximum noise level of just 39
decibels it's important to note that
while this is a huge improvement over
the previous model it's still quite a
bit louder than premium coolers from the
likes of Noctor or thermal right for
example the brace isn't being pushed as
an out of the box overclocking solution
by AMD and rather they're hoping to
provide a cooler that can keep their FX
series and future processes at an
acceptable temperature without making
your ears bleed evidently the plan isn't
just to offer a quieter box cooler but
also something that's a little more
visually appealing placed on top of the
raid there's a fan shroud complete with
LED lighting exit into the shroud of the
letters AMD with the company logo which
appear only when the system is switched
on when the system isn't running you
can't see the logo at all the race will
begin shipping with the FX 83 70 and
then presumably with all FX processors
while it could also end up getting
paired with higher end apu which is
really exciting so without wasting any
more time let's clip it onto the am3+
socket and run a few tests it might seem
silly to compare the Wraith of the
northern one liquid cooler but there's a
good reason why we've done this it's
here to help put the performance games
provided by the Wraith over the d3 into
perspective the Intel RTS 2011 LC
which was developed by a stack was
intended for use with sandy bridge-e
processors such as the core i7 39 70 X
if we look at the idle temperatures the
rate is just 4 degrees cooler than the
d3 which might not seem like much of an
improvement
however the 32 degree idle temperature
means the Wraiths allowed the FX 83-70
to run just a single degree warmer than
a closed-loop liquid cooler so
relatively the rate does extremely well
here under load using the aida64 system
stability test the old d3 cooler allowed
the FX 83-70 to reach a toasty height 75
degrees is terribly high temperature of
the d3 isn't even the worst part
the noise the cooler generates in an
effort to keep the processor operational
is almost unbearable the race wasn't
only much quieter but it kept the
processor below 60 degrees right
throughout the 20 minutes stress test
the low temp of 59 degrees meant the
race was 21% cooler than the d3 and
incredibly just 13% warmer than the
liquid cooler the Wraiths also compared
well to the cooler master hyper to 1/2 X
a cooler which we've used in the past to
achieve impressive overclocks on the FX
processors speaking of which I pushed
the FX 83-70 to 4.7 gigahertz using 1.5
volts the load temperature never
exceeded 72 degrees with the Wraiths
taking care of business not a bad result
and still cooler than the d3 at stock
settings before wrapping up the testing
portion of my video here are a few noise
comparisons of the d3 and rates coolers
the rate is certainly a much needed
upgrade to the AMD package this new
cooler should mean budget shoppers can
pick up one of AMD's inexpensive 8 core
FX processors and get to wherever
clocking without any additional expenses
saving 20 to 30 dollars on the CPU
cooler might not seem like a big deal
but does go a long way in improving the
overall value of AMD's processors of
course you aren't going to be pulling
off any extreme overclock with the raid
and a 4.7 gigahertz overclock does seem
as though it's right on the limit that
said being able to push an FX processor
comfortably into around 4.4 to 4.6
gigahertz using the Box cool or
something that was previously
unthinkable now I'm probably getting a
bit ahead of myself with all this
overclocking talk cuz AMD never actually
mentioned overclocking at all when it
came to the new Wraith cooler the
intention was to deliver a new box
cooler that was better equipped for the
task so in that sense
mission accomplished AMD - thumbs up
thanks for watching another Hardware
unbox release day review
I'm your host Matt and I'd love to hear
what you think is the race in the
comments or an F for my Hardware on box
