unboxed actually firstly let me just say
welcome to 2017 I can't wait to see what
goodies the tech industry has first this
year
speaking of tech goodies last month
Corsair announced their new SSD it's an
nvme SSD series called the force MP 500
the release comes hot on the heels of
Samsung's 960 series so the MP 500
really is being thrown in the deep end
at least on paper that doesn't seem to
be a big problem for Corsair as their
new speedy SSD series boasts some pretty
impressive specifications based on the
m2 2280 form factor they utilized the
pcie 3.0 x 4 interface for blistering
fast sequential read speeds of 3
gigabytes per second coupled with an
equally impressive write throughput of
2.4 gigabytes per second what's
interesting is that although consumers
can purchase the MP 500 and one of three
capacities 120 gigabyte 240 gigabyte or
480 gigabyte Corsair is claiming the
same sequential read and write
performance for all three models that
said there is a rather large discrepancy
in input/output performance with the 120
gigabyte version severely lagging behind
the larger 240 gigabyte and 480 bite
models so as you might expect
performance will be down on the 120
gigabyte model so just be aware of that
for testing we do have the granddaddy
the 480 gigabyte model on hand and
that's the biggest fastest model
available in the series at present so we
will be showing best case performance
then what's interesting about the new 4
MP 500 series and quite important to
note is the fact they are using mlc nand
memory and not the cheaper less durable
TLC stuff like the 960 Evo series this
is worth keeping in mind when noting the
price as the 480 gigabyte version that
we have is retailing for around 325 us
or four hundred and forty dollars for my
fellow aziz the 512 gigabyte version of
the 960 pro which also uses mlc nand
cost 330 u.s. or 450 ozzie the only
possible Thorne and Corsair side is the
TLC base 960 Evo version
the 500 gigabyte model cost just 250 US
or 340 Ozzy so I'll be interesting to
see how the MP 500 compares in terms of
performance before we jump to the
benchmarks I just like to touch on a few
more things whereas the Samsung models
feature a Samsung controller Corsa
hasn't actually had to rely on a
third-party that third party being fires
them with their PS 5 double-oh-seven
- c7 controller so far there are very
few SSDs in the world using this
controller so I'm personally yet to see
how it handles connected to the
controllers to shape a 15 nanometer mlc
nand along with a 512 megabyte DRAM
buffer please note that the 240 gigabyte
model features a smaller 256 megabytes
buffer and the 120 gigabyte model comes
with a 128 megabytes buffer currently
aes 256-bit encryption isn't supported
but corsair does hope to deliver a new
firmware update soon to add in support
finally all three models are being
backed by a three-year warranty which
isn't bad though we would have liked to
have seen them match Samsung's five-year
warranty still Corsa is claiming a 698
terabytes of written data rating but of
course you only have three years to
prove them wrong when it comes to
software the force MP 500 series is
backed by the rather ugly Corsair SSD
toolbox it has to be said I am used to
seeing much more polished looking
software from Corsair and I expect the
SSD toolbox to see some major upgrades
in 2017 basically most of the functions
aren't compatible with nvme drives at
this point so MP 500 owners can't view
the drive smart status total host rights
run a secure wipe change the over
provisioning or mess with the trim
command settings technically the MP 500
doesn't require a special driver to work
that said it does if you want to extract
a maximum performance from the drive and
right now Corsair doesn't actually offer
an nvme driver Samsung recently released
a new nvm Express driver which greatly
improved performance under Windows 10
and 8.1 the problem being that these
operating systems by default enable a
write cache buffer known as the force
unit access command which dramatically
reduces
performance this command is a
conservative approach taken by Microsoft
to ensure data integrity in case of
sudden power loss
however from Windows 8 onwards Microsoft
also incorporated an automatic flush
command to ensure data integrity but
they simultaneously maintain the
much-older force unit access command in
the standard driver settings this
redundancy means that the write speeds
are significantly inhibited due to an
unnecessary write verification process
by manually disabling the command the
write performance does reach expected
levels however manually manipulating
drive properties isn't very user
friendly which is obviously why samsung
developed their own nvme driver to do
this automatically
hopefully Corsair will follow suit and
do the same anyway by this point I think
we've pretty much covered the meat
potatoes of it let's get to that juicy
steak I of course mean the benchmarks
I'm just going to breeze through a few
graphs and then show you the force MP
500 going head-to-head with the samsung
960 Evo using an external capture device
to show you real-time performance right
so first up we have the a s SSD
benchmark sequential results here the MP
500 looks good despite being slower than
its Samsung rivals the read bandwidth
was down 15% when compared to the 960
pro while the write performance was
disappointingly 36% lower the 4k 64
thread performance was also down on the
Samsung drives here the MP 500 was 44%
slow in the 960 pro when comparing the
write performance again the MP 500 s
numbers were respectable but just not as
large as we would have liked the drives
access times are on par with a 960 Pro
so that's great to see interestingly
both of these drives though are slower
than the older 950 Pro here we have a
few quick copy tests and we find the MP
500 struggling to compete with last
season's 9 and 50 Pro in fact while the
prog copy performance was much the same
the MP 500 was almost 30% slower and
moving our game data then compared to
Samsung's 960 series it was a bit of a
bloodbath if I'm honest the last graph
we're going to look at shows us the
7-zip file extraction performance again
the MP 500 does come in well under what
we were hoping for taking 93 seconds to
complete the work load with a throughput
of just 3
hundred eighty-three megabytes per
second surprisingly that actually makes
it slower than the Kingston Predator SSD
first up for the side-by-side
comparisons we have everyone's favorite
the boot test this one's pretty simple
we measure the time it took for the
system to load starting the test is the
Windows 10 logo appeared we then stop
the clock the moment the desktop loaded
this tilt course has np-500 just four
seconds an impressive time indeed
meanwhile the 960 Evo limped over the
finish line a few seconds later and
given the results just seen previously
I'm surprised to see the MP 500 winning
in this test want to be the first one
into every game well a snappy SSD is the
best way to achieve that the 960 Evo
took just 8 seconds to complete the Call
of Duty infinite warfare level load time
test meanwhile the MP 500 was slightly
slower taking 11 seconds not much in it
though and this is the kind of
performance I was expecting to see it
also makes the MP 500 a good bit faster
than your typical sadr SSD as well those
of you who fire up Premiere Pro CC
multiple times a day like I do will
appreciate how quick an nvme Drive makes
things the 960 Evo takes just 5 seconds
to load Premiere Pro while the MP 500
took 9 seconds again even at nine
seconds the MP 500 is a good bit faster
than your average SATA SSD finally we
have the 7-zip 38 gigabyte file
extraction test and although we have
already looked at the performance in
this test previously in graph form this
is how the MP 509 60 Evo compare in a
real-time comparison as seen previously
when loading windows applications and
games the MP 500 isn't that much slower
than the 960 Evo how it was actually
faster getting into Windows however when
we do start to turn up the heat with
some heavy right traffic the MP 500 does
start to lag behind the competition and
this was seen previously when looking at
the file copy tests small writes also
seem to be a bit of an issue as well and
this is something fires and controllers
have struggled with in the past the 960
Evo is able to blast through the 7-zip
test thanks to a throughput of 660
megabytes per second and frankly that
still makes it rather slow in comparison
to the 960 pros almost 1 gigabytes per
second sustained throughput the MP 500
on the other hand
just over a minute and a half to
complete the test due to a rather
limited 383 megabytes per second
throughput granted that hardly makes it
slow though well under half the
performance of Samsung's 960 Pro it
looks like Corsair really needs to be
more aggressive with their pricing which
isn't great as I do believe the margins
are already very slim here Corsairs
force MP 500 is a solid contender based
on our testing it seems to do everything
quite well and if you can ignore the
recently released samsung 960 series for
just a moment then yeah it looks pretty
good the problem being that it's
entering in an arena that's already
occupied by two uncontested heavyweights
fighting for the same team basically
it's a bit like taking a light
heavyweight and throwing him in the
Octagon to battle it out against steep a
Miocic and Cain Velasquez it's not going
to go well of course Corsair might be
able to change things a little over the
coming months to help stack things more
in their favor essentially they would do
this by lowering the price though it has
to be said I don't believe there is much
room to move here unfortunately for now
the MP 500 series does come up short
against the 960 Pro in a nutshell for
the same price you're getting less
performance and a shorter warranty
period that said you can actually buy
the MP 500 right now for the advertised
MSRP while the 960 pro availability is
still very poor at least at the time of
creating this video finally I am in the
process of updating my core i7 benchmark
machine we will be updating it to KB
Lake even though it's not really much of
an update but still we will be going
with the core i7 7700 K and I'm not sure
what speed will be clocking that out for
the benchmarks might go up from 4.5 from
the 6700 K to something like four point
eight or four point nine with the 7700 K
life a little bit more thinking about
that but anyway that system will be
sponsored by a Corsair so they're
providing a heap of cool stuff case
power supply this SSD will be in there
the MP 500 and will also be featuring
for secondary storage the force Ally SSD
as well so keep an eye out for that
build video with that I'm going to hand
it over to you guys as always let me
know what you think in the comments I'm
your host Steve and I will see you on
the next one
