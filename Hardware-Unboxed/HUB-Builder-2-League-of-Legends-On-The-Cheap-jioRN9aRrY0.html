builder we're going to take a look at
League of Legends performance now need
for those looking to build a new budget
rig the intention is to find that
perfect balance between price and
performance now it's no secret the
League of Legends will play on just
about anything even with the graphical
quality settings cranked that said for
perfectly smooth playable 1080p
performance you will need to be somewhat
careful of what hardware you choose as
always it can be cheaper and better
value to shop secondhand for low-end
gaming machines but if you aren't
interested in taking on the challenge of
secondhand shopping then we have some
easy brand new options here my search
for the best value budget League of
Legends machine was narrowed down to two
choices after benchmarking almost every
option available the most affordable
option comes from AMD with their AAA
7600 this apu features now 7 graphics
processor with 384 SPU's clocked at 720
megahertz the FM two plus build came to
$265 but was also tested with the
optional $135 radeon r7 370 and 110
dollar geforce gtx 750ti the more
expensive option being recommended is an
Intel Haswell build focused around the
unlocked Pentium G 3258 this CPU doesn't
include an integrated GPU which is what
boosts the cost of the base
configuration in our case after three
hundred seventy dollars as the geforce
gtx 750ti was selected for the rest of
the hardware both systems were loaded
with 8 gigabytes of ddr3 2400 memory at
a cost of forty dollars a 120 gigabyte
version of the a data SP 554 $35 and the
EVGA 500 watt 80 plus bronze certified
power supply for forty dollars all of
this was built into the $30 cougar MH
200 case this means seventy dollars was
spent on the case and power supplier so
you can save some money here going with
a lesser quality case / power supply
combo if your budget is really tight
benchmarking League of Legends can be
tricky but I found the best and easiest
way to do this is by using a service
such as LOL king to download a replay
the replay can then be executed using
your current graphical settings in a
program such as fraps can record the
framerate performance the replay that i
downloaded featured 10 players that
looks like they knew what their
are doing so it was a fairly fast paced
and action field match the fraps test
lasted 10 minutes and I reported the
minimum and average frame rates running
this house for this long gave extremely
accurate results but I still took an
average across three runs which for the
most part came out exactly the same each
time so with that said let's get into
the results first up we have the very
high results at 1080p and here we see
the amt am one processor the athlon 5350
struggles to deliver playable
performance with frame dips as low as 60
FPS the integrated 128 SPU radiant I GPU
is the primary issue here the desktop
equivalent would sit somewhere between
the Radian are five to thirty and 220
the AMD a8 7600 which they're ultra
low-cost choice does struggle but the 43
FPS average meant it was smooth for the
most part adding a discrete GPU to the
AMD system such as the gtx 750ti boosted
performance by massive 78% when looking
at the minimum frame rate and
sixty-three percent on average this is
obviously a huge leap in performance and
that being the case I was shocked by how
much better the Pentium 3258 performed
with both the Radeon r7 360 and geforce
gtx 750ti here the 750 ti is minimum
frame rate is seventy-three percent
greater when paired with the G 3258
which meant we never saw a drop below 70
1 FPS needless to say the game was
extremely smooth and very playable under
these conditions reducing the overall
quality down to high from very high only
nets as a few extra frames per second in
most instances the a8 7600 configuration
for example rendered 3 FPS more when
looking at the minimums and just a
single frame more on average the lowest
quality setting our use of medium since
I really wanted to focus on the highest
in game quality settings anyway you're
dropping down to medium from high
boosted the minimum frame rate of the
aah 7600 system by 2 FPS to 28 FPS while
the average frame rate jumped up by 5
FPS to 49 FPS even here the am1 systems
still struggled with the minimum of 19
fps and average of 34 FPS it's pretty
incredible that a brand new sub $300
computer can deliver playable
performance in League of Legends the key
to this build was the AMD a8 7600
processor and its accompanying a 58mm 2
plus motherboard although you can add a
discrete graphics card to this budget
build doing so with say the gtx 750
I will bump the total build cost up to
375 dollars and for that price you may
as well invest in the significantly
faster Haswell platform for that price
the Pentium G 3258 and gtx 750ti combo
delivered considerably more performance
in league of legends of course you can
overclock both the AMD and Intel systems
for improved performance evidently the G
3258 doesn't really need to be
overclocked with minimum staying above
70 FPS the aah 7600 will need its neck
wrung to get anywhere near that when it
comes to cpu utilization neither the G
3258 or aah 7600 fully utilized under
any conditions in this game all for
cause of the a8 7600 were loaded to
around twenty percent with just one core
sitting around fifty percent so it seems
League of Legends really only requires a
dual core processor and core efficiency
or clock speed will be king here you
might be wondering why I didn't go with
the cheaper dual core apu then like the
$38 richland a 470 300 for example in
terms of CPU performance this wouldn't
be a downgrade for this title but the
192 SPU's GPU would have been a massive
downgrade offering only slightly better
performance and the athlon 5350 adding
in a discrete GPU to offset the week
integrated GPU performance results in
the same scenario that a 8 7600 faced
for slightly more the G 3258 is world's
faster speaking of downgrades you could
swap out the G 3258 for the cell Ranji
1820 and not sacrifice too much
performance but I really don't recommend
this as it saves just twenty dollars and
fur goes the ability to overclock I hope
those of you looking at building a new
cost-effective League of Legends machine
families builds useful if you have any
questions let me know in the comments
and I'll see you guys next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
