corner a lot of interesting stories to
get to this week including Intel yet
again leaking their own products before
an official announcement a m-- DS
supposedly superior performance in the
battlefield 5 closed alpha plus a few
cool monitors and other bits and bobs
let's get into it this first story was
actually given to us by Sal Kagan in our
patreon exclusive discord chat so thanks
to them for looking through some Intel
documents and pointing this out anyway
Intel has leaked the names and
specifications of their upcoming 9000
series processes ahead of time and what
is another accidental reveal of products
that he had to be formally announced
this same sort of thing happened a few
months ago with the Zed 390 chipset and
now we're seeing leaks regarding the
CPUs themselves in any case Intel's
official micro code update guidance
document revealed the names of seven
9000 series processors which
interestingly are listed under the
coffee lake s codename and eighth
generation branding I think they will
end up officially as ninth gen
processors but at least in these
documents they fall under 8th gen so
we'll use Intel's official terms for now
the microcode document is interesting
because it provides the names but it's
actually a different official document
that revealed the specifications and
confirms everything this one titled June
2018 8th gen core family update again
seven new processors are listed here
ranging from the core i3 9000 to the
core i5 9600 K and what will be
disappointing news to many enthusiasts
it looks like these 9000 series parts
are pretty basic refreshes of intel's
current coffee like products the i5 9600
k for example is exactly the same as the
i5 8600 k except the base clock is
raised from 3.6 to 3.7 gigahertz and the
maximum turbo free considers raise from
four point three to four point five
gigahertz that's it it's not really
clear whether the 9600 K has
hyper-threading enabled the 8600 K of
course does not but everything else
including TDP cache graphics and core
count remains the same it's a similar
story with the rest of the product
lineup Intel appears to be giving a
hundred to two hundred megahertz clock
speed bumps for most parts
looks like the silicon is exactly the
same otherwise for an unlocked part like
the 9600 K the clock speed bumps will be
pretty meaningless as this CPU should
overclock to pretty much the same levels
as the anti 600 K what is not seen in
either of these Intel documents is the
core i7 9700 K it's not listed among
other processors with the six plus two
configuration in other words six core
processors in the microcode document
whereas the 8700 k is found there it's
hard to know for sure but this would
suggest that the 9700 K will feature a
different configuration and may not be a
basic refresh of existing coffee like
processes if I had to guess I'd say the
9700 K will be the long-awaited eight
core coffee link chip but we'll find out
in a few months this next story is one
that's been doing the rounds a fair bit
this week PC games n tested the
battlefield 5 closed alpha and found the
AMD Radeon rx 580 destroying the nvidia
geforce gtx 1066 gigabyte in both direct
x11 and DirectX 12 tests in their
testing the RX 580 was 65% faster than
the GTX 1060 at 1080p using DirectX 11
when comparing the minimum frame rates
and was more than twice as fast in DX 12
and 1440p they found a 40% margin in
favor of the RX 580 these are pretty
interesting and quite surprising results
but there's a lot of things to consider
firstly battlefield 5 is just an alpha
right now and it's not clear what level
of Driver optimization and support has
been made by AMD and NVIDIA that said
these are sizable margins and the game
is supposed to be in video title at
launch so we'll see how those things end
up at release it's also important to
note that testing multiplayer games in a
controlled repeatable fashion is pretty
difficult the battlefield 5 closed alpha
appears to be multiplayer only and we
really have no idea how PC games and
tested the title plus their results are
actually contradictory to what sweet
clock is found in the game they had the
rx 580 only narrowly reading the GTX
1060 in their testing which is more in
line with the typical result for an rx
580 versus a GTX 1060 ideally we'd like
to take a look and see what's going on
and what could be the cause of PC games
ends results but unfortunately it's a
closed alpha and we don't have access so
you just have to wait a bit for our
benchmarks oh and an official bug list
on the battlefield
forums lists a massive performance issue
is present with the Ambiorix series
cards with PC games and suggesting AMD
cards performs significantly better than
nvidia at the moment and sweet lockers
finding something different it's
possible that AMD cards are not
correctly rendering some effects at the
moment for some users and configurations
also pc games then tested with a rise in
cpu while sweet lockers tested with
coffee like so there might be a few
differences there we'd be taking most of
these results with the grain of salt
right now until more testing is done
anyway I certainly don't think AMD will
destroy Nvidia in this title at least by
this sort of margin come the final
release a couple of bits of monitor news
now Acer has launched the pro designer
BM 270 which is a 27 inch 4k
professional-grade display with HDR
support and it's not just any sort of
HDR the IPS panel sports 1000 its of
paper itis and it has 384 local dimming
zones plus the panel is capable of
reproducing 97.8% of the DCI p3 gamut
we're also looking at formula
second-grader grey response times and
178 degree viewing angles importantly
for professionals the BM 270 features
factory calibration to sub 1.0 Delta s
is also not designed for gaming so the
refresh rate is cap to 60 Hertz I have a
feeling this monitor might be using the
same panel as the 4k 144 Hertz g-sync
HDI display is considering its
specifications
except of course without juicing support
and without support for high refresh
rates while it doesn't have G sync it's
still not going to come cheap it will
set you back seventeen hundred US
dollars when it hits shelves soon
speaking of products hitting show the
philips momentum 43 inch 4k HDR display
is now available i covered this monitor
in news corner a couple of weeks ago but
basically it's a 43 inch quantum dot MV
a panel with display HDR 1000
certification meaning 1,000 hits of peak
brightness and proper HDR support plus
it supports free sync and has an
overclockable refresh rate of 80 Hertz
in Europe the monitor is priced at 800
euros and it should come in near $800 in
the US however Amazon u.s. is currently
selling it for $1000 for some reason
which is a bit inflated in any case the
monitor is available now for those that
are interested asrock has expanded their
line of phantom gaming graphics cards to
include the Radeon rx Vega 56 and Vega
64 both
use a reference air-cooled design and
stock clock speeds so neither is
particularly exciting we're expecting
pricing to fall near the proper MSRP for
these cards but we don't have
confirmation on exact pricing just yet
they should be available soon
Coolermaster has launched the mastercase
h 500 a cheaper alternative to their h
500 p and h 500 m cases this new chassis
not to be confused with NZXT sh 500 case
keeps the two front 200 millimeter RGB
fans and you'll be able to choose
between an airflow optimized mesh front
or a transparent panel front you'll
still be able to fit a 360 millimetre
radiator in the front and a 280
millimeter radiator in the top and all
the basic features of the other 500
cases have transitioned over the H 500
should be available at the end of July
for around $100 if you're interested so
I thought this story was particularly
funny this week sony has stuffed up
massively by uploading an entire movie
to YouTube instead of just the trailer
the company posted what was supposed to
be a trailer for the movie Carly the
killer which incidentally has a terrible
score on IMDB but instead of uploading
the trailer they managed to upload the
entire film all one hour and 29 minutes
of it with the title that says trailer I
honestly have no idea how this sort of
error could occur was there a folder on
the upload computer that had both the
trailer and the full movie in it for
some reason and someone just carelessly
dragged the wrong one into the YouTube
upload it's pretty bizarre stuff the
film has now been removed but it's a
pretty hilarious mistake by Sony they're
moving into some rumors to end this
video firstly we have what appears to be
the first benchmark result for the
upcoming rise in 320 300 X this is
supposedly a 65 watt processor with 4
cores and 4 threads along with a 3.5
gigahertz base clock and 4.2 gigahertz
boost clock those specs place it very
similar to the Rison 320 200 G just
without the integrated graphics and with
a faster CPU turbo clock
I'd expect pricing to sit around that of
the 2100 years well though we don't
really know for sure at the moment
anywhere we have the cpu-z screenshot
and a Cinebench r15 M team run that
shows a score of 690 and that seems
about right for this sort of CPU and
judging by the photos and other stuff
this one looks pretty legitimate to me
it's expected that 2300 X will launch
alongside B 450 mother
in a couple of weeks I know some people
are probably wondering about this
supposed appearance of a gtx 1180 at a
vietnamese retailer priced at fifteen
hundred US dollars and with a GT 104 GPU
well this one is pretty clearly fakes
I'm not gonna spend a lot of time on at
the photo is just a photoshopped soos
ROG Strix GT X 1080 box and that price
is just a straight-up guess so is the
launch date of September 28th so
definitely don't believe every rumor you
see and the fire rumor from this week
concerns AMD's allegedly upcoming H
series processors for performance
notebooks a couple more leaks have
appeared this week detailing the 45 watt
SKUs and some specs an engineering qsr
sample featured a quad core eight thread
CPU with the 3.3 gigahertz base clock
3.6 gigahertz boost clock and Vega 11
graphics in other words it's a fully
unlocked Rison APU die similar to the
2400 G just with a lower CPU clocks with
more leaks relating to this CPU it seems
pretty clear md's getting closer to a
release so hopefully it won't be too
long before AMD has a competitive CPU
for high performance laptops anyway
