YouTube tech reviewer is to find the
oldest most rubbish mother body cam and
see if the rx4 ad will work it's a lot
of fun I thought it might be interesting
to get onboard this latest craze and in
doing so add a little twist by also
testing with the gtx 1060 so i began
digging out the oldest - most forgotten
about hardware in the office my search
turned up a few am-3 boards along with a
couple of LGA 1156 boards the only
problem was they all worked with the RX
4 80 booted into windows played games
and well they were rather than head down
to local electronics recycling center to
see what garbage had lying around I gave
up on the idea and instead change gears
to something else something I feel is
even more interesting having already
dusted off an old Core i5 750 system
along with a phenom ii x4 955 system
from the same era I had a light bulb
moment why not test both systems using
the RX 480 and gtx 1060 see how these
new bid range GPUs compare in old
systems more than likely game is making
the upgrade to a current gen mid-range
CPU I'm drafting the latest core i7
processor overclocked to 4.5 gigahertz
instead many are probably running a more
affordable previous gen core i3 or Core
i5 processor or alternatively one of
AMD's phenom or FX processors so we've
seen how the 480 and 1060 compare when
they aren't being restrained by CPU
limitations to how they get on with a
much lesser processor in this video
we're going to find out I should point
out that neither the i5 750 or x4 955
have been overclocked or tweaked in any
way included purely for comparison is my
standard GPU test rig as already have
the results for both GPUs in this system
this is an overclocked PC so I'm not
trying to make a direct comparison here
but rather show how fast is mid-range
GPUs are we're not hampered by a system
bottleneck starting with The Witcher 3
we see the gtx 1060 was 11% faster than
the arcs for ad on my 6700 K test system
moving to the i5 750 system reduced the
1060 performance by 30% but despite that
the 1060 was still 10% faster than the
rx 4 ad on the old core i5 rig moving to
the phenom ii x4 system the 1060 drops
are further
11% down to 38 fps here we find that on
the AMD system the RX 480 and 10 60
deliver the same 38 FPS average for
benchmarking Star Wars Battlefront we
use a single player tutorial which is
some very CPU demanding at all making
this primarily a GPU test as such the
GTX 1060 delivers very similar
performance on all three systems the RX
4 80 provides very similar performance
on both the Intel rigs but does slow
down quite a bit on the Phenom system
fallout 4 is a massive system resource
hog so I'm not surprised to see some
major variations in performance here
that said the performance trends remain
quite similar for the most part looking
at the minimum frame rate the 1060 was
20% faster than the RX for 80 on the
core i7 6700 K test system meanwhile on
the core i5 750 system the 1060 s
minimum frame rate was 27% higher
finally on the phenom ii x4 system we
find the 1060 is just 5% faster the
division shows pretty similar
performance trends across all three
systems and it's really only the RX 480
and phenom ii x4 combo this is a big hit
in the minimum frame rate Department
ARMA 3 isn't a CPU intensive game at
least not the way that many seem to
believe the game is poorly optimized and
doesn't utilize more than a single CPU
thread heavily as a result CPUs with
strong single thread IPC performance
went out the highly clock 6700 K shows
this is the GTX 1060 average 72 fps this
result was reduced to just 40 FPS with
the i5 750 and then 31 FPS with a phenom
ii x4 interestingly the RX 4 ad actually
compared better with the gtx 1060 on the
slower processors Mirror's Edge catalyst
isn't a CPU intensive game and as a
result the margins remained fairly
consistent across all three systems
total war Warhammer is an interesting
title the provided interesting results
there be aware we only tested using
DirectX 11 mode the RX 4 ad actually
looks better in relation to the GTX 1060
on the slower systems which is pretty
surprising the Doom results are
particularly Italian honestly I was
expecting to see more results like this
using the OpenGL or Vulcan we see the RX
4 ad play is considerably worse than the
GTX 1060 on the older systems while the
arcs priority was faster on the 6700 K
system using Vulcan by
16% margin it's actually 21% slower when
using the core i5 750 rig and 29% lower
on the Phenom 2 system in ashes of the
singularity we see dx12 does a good job
of keeping the RX 480 in the game when
testing on the slower systems it was 15%
slower than the 1060 on the 6700 K test
system when running the game in DirectX
11 mode when we move to the core i5 750
machine the 480 is now 35% slower
however using DirectX 12 we see the same
6% decline in performance well I didn't
manage to run into any compatibility
issues with my radiant rx 4 ad on these
old systems but I did end up finding
some interesting results for the most
part the 480 didn't fare nearly as
poorly against the gtx 1060 s i thought
at mine there were of course exceptions
those such as doom and ashes of the
singularity using DirectX 11 it was
interesting although admittedly not all
that surprising to see just how much
slower these new mid-range graphics
cards were on these old quad-core
systems it's also been quite a long time
since I've seen the Core i5 750 phase 2
phenom ii x4 955 and honestly i
forgotten how much better the intel
processor was for gaming the performance
difference is likely being amplified by
the use of modern games that take full
advantage of quad-core processors with
the exception of arma 3 so in short it
appears you're going to be seeing
similar performance margins between the
480 and 1060 on older hardware on that
note you're also going to see
considerably greater performance when
using a modern processor or at least a
relatively modern processor overclocked
I didn't have time to overclock the core
i5 and phenom ii x4 processors for this
video but perhaps i can do a more
in-depth video in the near future
featuring more GPU and CPU
configurations for you guys if you guys
are keen to see it what did you guys
think of these results were they
surprising let me know in the comments
