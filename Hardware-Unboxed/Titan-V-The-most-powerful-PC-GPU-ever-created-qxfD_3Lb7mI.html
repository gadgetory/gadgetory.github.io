yesterday some pretty massive news came
in from Nvidia then unexpectedly
announced the world's most powerful PC
GPU ever created at the 2017 neural
information processing systems
conference company CEO and founder
Jensen Wong took the stage to show off
the card which is based on the company's
Valter architecture Nvidia actually
first announced volta based products
seven months ago now the tesla v100
accelerator pci express accelerator card
for data centers the titan v on the
other hand is designed to be used in pcs
well it probably costs more than your pc
i know it cost more than mine the GV 100
powered Titan V which is fabricated on
the new TSMC 12 nanometer FF and
manufacturing process the F F stands for
FinFET but what's the n all about you
ask well the end simply stands for in
video so FinFET in video and video now
has their own node over at TSMC and that
has allowed them to create this truly
massive GPU but more on that in a moment
the titan v is available today at the
bargain basement price of three thousand
dollars u.s. it features 110 teraflops
of raw performance 21 point 1 billion
transistors 12 gigabytes of HBM to
memory 5120 cuda cores and 640 10 cycles
nvidia says it has nine times the
horsepower of its predecessor the Pascal
based Titan XP or at least it does when
talking about compute horsepower now
this is still a consumer-grade desktop
GPU believe it or not
that said the Titan series has always
been a prosumer type product selling for
around or just over a thousand dollars
u.s. there have been a few exceptions to
that but anyway the Titan V pretty much
kills that I wouldn't be surprised if we
do see sort of a cut-down type Titan
released next year maybe that the Titan
VP without the tents of course for
example that was meant to be a bit of a
joke but anyway moving on the Titan V is
targeted towards researchers developers
and scientists working in the field of
ai and machine learning much like the
Tesla V 100 announced back in May no
gaming performance information has been
in revealed though Nvidia did say that
the GPU uses the standard GeForce driver
stack in fact just a few days ago a new
video released the 388 point 59 driver
bringing official Titan V support with
no less than 5,000 120 cuda cores
clocked no lower than 1.2 of yogurts in
fact the rated boost frequency is 1455
megahertz and it's not much slower than
that of the Titan XP just 8% lower in
fact so there's really no question the
Titan V is the world's fastest and most
powerful graphics card even for games or
probably even for games the key thing to
note here is that the double precision
is at half rate and that results in 6.9
teraflops and that makes up world's fast
and the Titan XP also in compared to the
Titan XP the new Titan VIII packs 33%
more CUDA cores and 43 percent more than
the GTX 1080 Ti 5120 cuter course is an
incredible amount of CUDA cores but I do
wonder how efficiently they can all be
utilized without a sync compute needless
to say if it were to be compared on a
clock for clock basis to say the GTX
tuna a you'd likely not really see
anywhere near a 43 percent jump in
performance at least in games so keep
that in mind if you've got mad money to
drop on a Titan via graphics card for
your gaming rig in my opinion you
definitely shouldn't do that buy one of
these cards for gaming just would be an
epic waste of money that said although
the Titan V isn't a gaming graphics card
Nvidia I'm more than happy to sell up to
gamers with deep pockets and you just
know some of these will end up in gaming
rigs around the world loads of you have
been asking me if I'll be getting a
Titan Vita benchmark on the channel the
answer sadly though is no Nvidia says
they aren't sampling this product and I
can't say I'm all that surprised
still you'll likely see benchmarks pop
up online and they're not too distant
future I personally can't afford to buy
one for testing but I know there are
media outlets that can and probably will
that said if you happen to buy one and
you want it compared to every current
generation GPU and over 30 games at 3
resolutions I'm available I'm here for
you anyway as I said this isn't really
a gaming graphics card rather it's a
workstation level AI compute card and
with the inclusion of those unique
tensor cores it offers a massive
performance leap over the previous
models and for those of you unaware the
tentacles are invidious special deep
learning AI caused and the Titan V packs
640 of them the same amount as the Tesla
V 100 it's actually quite shocking to
see how similar the Titan V and Tesla V
100 are in terms of specs and likely
performance the Tesla V 100 is an
insanely expensive bitter kit in
comparison the Titan V is a bargain as
far as I can tell the only real
difference between the two is the memory
configuration the Titan V's memory
buffer is 25 percent smaller at 12
gigabytes and as a result the memory bus
width has been reduced by 25 percent and
this results in about 25 percent less
bandwidth 27 percent in fact to be
precise to a difference in clock speeds
the time v also lacks the envy link
functionality in the l2 cache size has
been reduced from 6 megabytes to four
and a half megabytes baking of memory I
should note that like the Tesla V 100
the Titan V also features HBM to memory
you're just getting 12 gigabytes of it
not the 16 gigabytes found on the tesla
model the HBM 2 memory has been down
clocked slightly to 1.7 gigahertz which
again coupled with the reduced capacity
has limited the memory bandwidth to 653
gigabytes per second so as I say that
out loud or limited might not have been
the best words used because that's still
a massive figure as for the card itself
well it looks mmm dare I say it a bit
tacky the gold die cast aluminium body
yeah
really Nvidia it probably doesn't look
that bad in the flesh but yeah it's
still gold I guess at least it'll go
with my gold motherboard and gold case
anyway it features a vapor chamber
cooler with a copper heatsink and blower
fan apart from the gold finish which
despite the asking price isn't real gold
this is the same foundation cooler
you'll find on the Titan XP and GTX 10 a
UTI for example this all makes sense
since the card has been slapped with a
250 watt TDP and it features the same 8
plus 6 pin PCI II power connecting
configure
as the Pascal Titans and GT x10 atti on
the reference PCB you'll find 16 power
phases though it's unlikely we'll see
any custom board partner Titan V models
so that's what we know about the Titan
VIII for now until some lucky or I
suppose broke tech enthusiast gets their
hands on one we won't know exactly how
fast it really is but you can safely
assume it is the world's fastest
graphics card as advertised by Nvidia
and it will be brutally fast compared to
anything we currently have what this
means for PC gamers next year is hard to
say
obviously there are faster gaming
graphics cards to come from Nvidia next
year and they will likely be a decent
step up from what we currently have the
only question remains now is will they
be a decent step up in terms of price we
will limited competition from AMD at the
moment and probably for the foreseeable
as well chances are you will be paying a
bit more for your high-end gaming
graphics cards next year of course we
just don't know what to expect at the
moment I'm a little concerned with where
things are headed but ultimately we'll
just have to wait and see what happens
even if AMD do happen to fall further
off the radar
Nvidia are still competing with
themselves and they do need to give
GeForce 10 series owners a reasonable
upgrade sure they can afford to
drip-feed as the next-generation a bit
like what they do with Pascal well that
doesn't really change the fact that gtx
980ti owners we're in no hurry to
upgrade to the gtx 1080 and most will
have probably waited for the gtx 1080i
all just decided to skip Pascal entirely
I know people carry on about their well
as I just described it the drip-feeding
of new current generation GPUs but I
honestly didn't have our problem with
Nvidia released in the GT X 1080 first
then the 1070 a month later and then the
1080 Ti was at something like nine
months later it's not like the 1070 for
example started at $500 us or even $600
u.s. or something crazy like that anyway
and then was knocked down to the current
$380 US MSRP for the AIB cards that's
been the price since day one and it
meant that you were getting performance
that the previous Maxwell generation
offered for something like six hundred
and fifty dollars us wrapping things up
like all
of you I'm keen to see in videos new
gaming focused graphics cards next year
as well as AMD's though Navi is expected
much later in the yeah you can expect me
to benchmark the hell out of them I
can't wait to do that anyway that's
going to do it for this one
I'm your host Steve see you next time
