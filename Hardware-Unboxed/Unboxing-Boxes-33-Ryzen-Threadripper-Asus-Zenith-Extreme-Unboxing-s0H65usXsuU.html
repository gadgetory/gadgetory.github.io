welcome back to harbor unbox for what is
going to be a very exciting video very
exciting indeed the doorbell just rang
five minutes ago and I got two pretty
cool packages and based on from the
label fairly certain they are my AMD
thread Ripper samples so we'll get into
those in a moment
yeah very exciting this video will go
out tonight so or you'll see quite a few
unboxing videos from various channels
because we are allowed to show the
unboxing procedure at a certain time
tonight and then a week from now we can
finally show you our proper reviews and
benchmarks like sort of stuff as you
think I've got the risin jacket on from
the previous unboxing when I got this
with my rise on three samples not many
excuses I can really use this for on the
channel but I thought AMD Rising thread
Ripper unboxing is going to get the
jacket out I think you guys will agree
anyway wait there I only get these boxes
yeah I don't say anything I don't need
to say anything let's just get the boxes
I always want the heavy 107 got the
collar on this train yet like most good
Andy products it'll probably take a few
firmware updates before it's a four it's
ready for retail anyway two massive
boxes here I know thread rip is a big
CPU but okay um yeah I'm not sure what's
in these possibly two full computers I
don't know these are massive boxes I've
never ever received anything like this
for a CPU review I'll just cut into both
of them I think actually the way will do
this is because they are just so massive
and it probably looks weird on camera
I'll get rid of the lighter of the two
and let's see what's in this one
oh ok what do we have here what is that
the components you need to create the
ultimate desktop system platform well
not sure what that's all about but it's
pretty cool I'll put that there all
right ah x3 nine I'm motherboard that is
the heaviest motherboard box I've ever
picked up are oh jeez that is extreme
that is a seriously heavy mother war box
I have no idea what's in that possibly a
lead brick or a motherboard now yeah the
heaviest motherboard ever okay we've got
two of the g.skill RGB the Trident II
RGB memory so that's a 32 gig I
think for 32 week modules and this would
be another 432 give up modules take a
look at those in a minute we're pretty
familiar with those on the channel we've
looked at multiple kicks okay so we're
getting it looks like everything I'll
turn this I'll turn this up okay a
couple of empty padding boxes oh that's
a heavy power supply okay so we have the
Thermaltake tough power iSeries RGB 1250
watt power supply
very cool power supply of it let's be
honest that's not what you why you guys
are here we also have the flow ring 360
then we'll take premium liquid cooler so
that's an ollie one liquid cooler thrown
sixty millimeter rad three 120
millimeter ring fans again very cool but
not while you're here
the g.skill memory we've seen lots of
times we'll take a look at them later
the motherboard I think that's probably
worth checking out and I want to know if
there is a lead brick in here or not
because that is a sweet-looking
motherboard suppose I should show it to
you guys it's the motherboard the tabie
crikey
that is without a doubt the heaviest
motherboard I've picked up and I've
picked up some dual socket server boards
before but this is definitely heavier
very very heavy board Wow made that look
difficult okay a big part of why this
board weighs so much as it does have a
rather large aluminium sort of a heat
spreader on the back it looks like
they're possibly some thermal pads under
there
definitely RGB lighting of course so
that's lucky about that I have to admit
I don't know a lot about this board but
it looks dare I say underwhelming for
such a heavy high-end extreme other what
I think this thing costs an absolute
fortune that doesn't seem to be that
well stocked in terms of features it
looks like there is an m2 slot under
this heat sink yep and I think it's
cooled by this heatsink so there's an
MDOT two port but there's only a 1 m2
port on this board so it's kind of
surprising for a thread ripper board I
mean you can put em two drivers by our
adapters in the PCI Express slots but
yeah thought we might have had a few
more of those on the board six SATA
ports and a u dot two port yeah it's not
extremely heavy on features it's a very
nice-looking board but yeah a little
dare I say disappointing when it comes
to features okay and it makes sense now
you get stickers so you know it is quite
feature-rich okay yep
I spoke without actually checking
everything out but that's what this
unboxing boxes series is all about I
know pretty much nothing about the
product going into it and I was
wondering what this dim
you can see there's an extra gym slot
here and it's got a weird little bracket
over here that stops you from installing
memory and I was like I wonder what
that's all about wonder no more because
this cool little adapter is what we'll
plug into there so if your popular
memory pop that in clips in the place
and that gives you a pair of em two
slots one on either side of the car and
that will support multiple cards
and there's a couple of thermal sensors
and things like that built on it built
onto it so yeah that's very cool indeed
so the board starter looks better and
better as we dig further into the box
and there is a lot more things in here
so what okay so that's a four-way SLI
bridge that's not super exciting what do
we have ow it bit me I'll live okay what
we have here is at a guess a 10 gigabit
card indeed it is so there you go tend
to give it networking and pop that right
in now if you wanted to so now you've
got a single gigabit wide solution and a
10 gigabit solution so that's quite cool
coaster I actually use a couple of SATA
cables they're not we're showing you sli
bridge galore three SLI bridges Wi-Fi
antenna okay so there's quite a few cool
things actually it looks like a decent
board I'm not going to waste too much
time on the board itself because again
that's not exactly why you guys are here
and although it is a cool motherboard so
I'll throw up some b-roll the boards so
you can get a better look at it a very
cool board and I'm looking very forward
to testing thread brittle with it so
let's clear all this stuff off and get
the second box which hopefully has some
CPUs in it okay time for box number two
I start to look a bit more like it let's
get this out you know you're moving some
pretty serious harbour when it comes in
a case like this I know what else is in
here but all right we got some CPUs I
kind of want to open this site on so you
guys can see it as I do it
I need another camera mounted from the
roof but you know budgets and all that
um press press yeah I won't open this on
its side that would go badly awesome
actually I might I might be able to
let's let's try this again I haven't
seen what's inside here honest here you
go you ready here we go whoa
funny looking TV things all right let's
get into this wow that's super cool that
that is a CPU and then that nearly went
horrible horribly bad oh wow that is
cool okay I don't think this is a
working CV I think this is just for show
and even so I'm glad I didn't drop it
because that is awesome wow that is cool
you guys might better see it but it says
Hardware unboxed on it with our little
logo okay so I daresay I wasn't meant to
take this whole thing apart hopefully I
haven't broken it I know it's just
magnetic all right
first they give me the risin jacket then
this they really don't want me to I give
a poor review hopefully I don't have to
that is that is one of the cooler things
I've received that's for sure get my
finger marks all over it but uh yeah
I'll get some b-roll I could stare at
that all day that's cool
I can got there for now that's probably
where that's going to sit for a very
long time up there on top of the
computer oh oh that's cool I didn't
actually realize until just then I don't
know how well it came out on camera I
might have to try and get some b-roll
that again it's actually light in there
so there's a switch there so when you
open the case up they're going above and
beyond for this thread Ripper launch
well for this year there's light behind
the packages behind the CPU boxes so
that's a pretty cool Pelican box right
there now that itself would be a rather
expensive anyway very cool now this is
what you've come for these very
bizarre-looking packages that are made
out of some sort of foam and have
cardboard or paper wrapped around them I
mean yes fyra cpu packaging goes there
they're pretty badass
I mean that's the Box one of my Xeon
processors came in that I bought and
that's the risin seven box so yeah and
then we have these beauties nothing to
throwing these around so this is my 1920
X and my 1950 X so the next question is
how do we how we actually open these rip
here what I really want to rip you but
says rip here so let's give that a go
well that didn't really oh there's a
snap
I'm butchering it I'm butchering it
it's butchered sticking to me okay well
maybe we won't destroy the next one as
much so there you go that is now ready
to be opened unlock the power let's
unlock the power shall we
you ready I'm locking the power all the
lights are still on
okay off that goes okay alright we're
out of the phone box we've got our
little tool here I believe that is for
securing the socket the tr4 socket and
the am4 adapter - okay interesting
there's the foam ah there's the CPU so
it did fall out it was still protected
though well that's kind of cool I guess
you could shoot that on the shelf
somewhere one of my shelves so messy
I've got no room to put anything all
right this is very heavy this part we
have a little metal Clippy surely you
pull that out
yep metal clip down and there's a little
orange tab here does that put okay you
push the orange tab down and that pops
off and then you are met with an
absolutely massive CPU except my one
there's a bit of a Knick taken out of
the surface oh it's quite rough so I'm
going to try and smooth that down it's
not very smooth come on AMD Quality
Control I have a lump on top of my cpu
so anyway but they're the 1920 X the red
rising threat Ripper and that is just a
truly massive CPU I'm so tempted to see
if that CPU there works but I'm sure
that's a dead CPU that printed on I
don't really want to put nothing on the
surface of it maybe I'll just mount it
in the socket and see if it posts yeah
it doesn't kill the board yeah these are
seriously heavy CPUs probably should
give you a look at it hopefully I've had
beer also you're not just sitting there
watching me blab on like I do but I'm
yeah I don't really know what else to
say that is a massive CPU looks cool in
the bathroom after all the videos we've
done hyping it and Amy's been slowly
giving us information and then it's kind
of weird to be finally holding it CPU
and hand go so I told you it happened
I've got a benchmark the hell out of it
the our PCB on this thing is in sanely
thick it has to be as a lot of surface
area be a very thick and I'm going to
put this over there hopefully that stays
safe and then in here you get the little
installation instruction manual which
probably no one anywhere is ever read
but there if you need it cool little
rise and sticker then rise in thread
ripper and then a really big horizon
thread ripper sticker there so stickers
four days in this unboxing
then a cool little patch to keep it all
in all right that's box number one down
I'm going to try and not destroy this
one all right that went a lot better I
really know why I want to keep that if I
need to get any footage of that it's now
not completely destroyed
okay so again unlock the power for the
second time are you ready
power unlocked now I'm going to stop
that from falling out this time there
you go I did it so again same deal here
just a funny thing and here we go much
the same as the previous CPU though this
one will have all 16 cores enabled and
32 threads whereas this one was the 12
core model so yeah 2 Rison thread Ripper
CPUs one rather large motherboard with a
huge desktop socket well it's actually a
server socket on desktop a little bit
big socket for a desktop board and yeah
open to two big boxes the studio is now
a horrific mess and I've got stuff
everywhere so that pretty much does it
for this episode of unboxing boxes
definitely one of the shorter episodes I
think it was actually we did do two
boxes it could have gone for a bit
anyway are my brains pretty much checked
out from the unboxing boxes stuff and
it's ready to get into the rise and a
thread River benchmarking so yeah let's
wrap this up so I can go get into some
serious benchmarks you've got to set the
system up fresh install the windows all
the benchmark stuff I'm going to have
that done starts with me a late night
gotta edit this video first actually but
anyway I can't wait to get into it it
looks like it's going to be a lot of fun
thank you very much AMD for this this is
super cool that's going to go sit there
for a long time so I might see if that
CPU works I'm pretty sure it won't yeah
so thanks for coming and watching
unboxing boxes thread repair Edition we
actually have a heap more products in
the unboxing so there'll be another
episode next week and definitely one the
week after I have a massive
stack our boxes over here am i right we
need to get through all those I was
planning and doing them in this episode
but you know an AMD sends you a review
kit like that you've kind of got to give
it your full attention
and well that's what I'm going to go to
right now I'll be how you Steve see you
again next time guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
