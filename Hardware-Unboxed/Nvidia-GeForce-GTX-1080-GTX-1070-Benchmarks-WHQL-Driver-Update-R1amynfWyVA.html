I'm an update a rather follow up to the
recent GeForce GTX 1080 and GTX 770
videos about three weeks ago now we got
our first look at the 1080 performance
and well it was pretty mighty in fact
the 1080 was so impressive
then Nvidia has seemingly gotten away
with asking an unbelievable $100 premium
for the reference card and has it pretty
well sold out everywhere given the
popularity of the $700 part I expect the
four hundred and fifty dollar Founders
edition of the GTX 1072 also sell like
hotcakes
of course we have first look at the gtx
1070 performance last week and again it
was very impressive stuff as it stands
in terms of price versus performance
there's nothing that can touch the 10:17
it is that good
that said AMD's recent announcement of a
$200 R X 480 might change that later
this month so be sure to stay tuned as
I'll be amongst the first to bring you
those results and I'm expecting good
things getting back to the 10 70s some
of you noticed that the first batch of
benchmark results weren't consistent
across the web although in my opinion
the GTX 1070 looked great now video as
well as testing done by others some
showed it to be even more impressive at
first I put this down to the fact that
we benchmarked after a 20 minute warm-up
period which sees the boost quite
reduced by reasonable margin however now
having had much more time to mess around
with the GTX 970 it appears most of the
lost performance was a result of the
early beta driver I used in some games
the 1070 performed as it should
well in others it was quite a bit slower
around 10% slower at times anyway
I held off making any updates with a
newer better driver and went straight to
the official whq L driver the driver in
question is the new g-force game ready
three six eight point three nine WH QL
driver which should now be publicly
available with official certified
drivers for both the GTX 1080 and 1070
all games previously tested have been
retested at 1080p 1440p and 4k now for
this video I'm taking a slightly
different approach and depending on how
well received it is by you guys will
determine how I create these massive
benchmark videos going forward whereas
the gtx 1070 video for example features
eleven and a half minutes of graphs
covering two wrestle
Lucian's across 22 games this video
would much shorter don't panic
I've still benchmarked over 20 games at
three popular resolutions and all the
graphs can be found at the hardware and
box website which will be linked in the
video description below the difference
being that this time I'll discuss the
individual results for just five games
at a single resolution we should reduce
the benchmark discussion to a few
minutes after which I'm gonna heavily
analyze the data from all 20-plus games
across the multiple resolutions and look
at how the various GPUs sucked up most
of you seem to really enjoy the data
break down towards the end of the 1080
and 1070 videos so this is what I'll be
focusing on this time before I jump into
the benchmarks here are a few quick
notes all tests were conducted using my
GPU test rig which is built inside the
corsair carbide 600c with an Intel Core
i7 6700 K clocked and locked at 4.5
gigahertz for a full list of the system
specs please check the video description
you'll also find a detailed video index
there as well finally this time the gtx
1070 and 1080 benchmarks were conducted
after a 10-minute warmup period as this
is sufficient time to get these cards
after their maximum working temperature
as always I'm using reference AMD and
NVIDIA graphics cards unless specified
picking which five games to look at
wasn't easy though ultimately it doesn't
really matter as the conclusion will be
based on the 20-plus games the graphs of
which can be found in the written review
that said let's take a look at the
results from The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt and
here we find the 1080 averaging 74 FPS
while the 1070 average 60 FPS making it
just 19% slower the 1080 might have been
24% slower than a pair of 980ti graphics
cards but it was 19% faster than the
Titan X and 21% faster than a single
980ti meanwhile the 1070 was just 3%
slower than the Titan X and 2 percent
slower than the 980ti despite smashing
the 970 by an incredible 76 percent
margin rise of the Tomb Raider presented
little challenge of the 1080 here we see
an average of 110 fps making it a 33%
faster than the 1070 that said the 1070
was still 5 percent faster than Titan X
and 11% faster than the gtx 980ti it
also crushed the fury X by 28% margin
and the i-93 90 by 57 percent margin
Star Wars Battlefront there's another
game that provide a little challenge to
the 1080 of 1440p so we found an average
of 98 FP
the 1070 was also very impressive with
77 FPS placing it between the Titan X
and the 980ti
this meant the 1070 was 4% faster than
the fury ax 31% faster than the r9 390
and 48 percent faster than the GTX 970
yet again we find the 1080 delivering
well over 100 FPS at 1440p this time 125
FPS in Doom using the maximum in-game
quality settings the 1070 was also very
powerful averaging 96 FPS making it 2
percent faster than the Titan X 7
percent faster than the 980 TI and 20%
faster than the fury x one of the more
demanding titles we test with this Tom
Clancy's the division and here the 1080
does drop down to an average of 76 FPS
which is of course still extremely
smooth as the framerate never dropped
below 60 fps the 1070 was able to
average 61 fps though at times duds dip
to 48 fps although this isn't the kind
of game where that's going to be an
issue the division played very well here
the 1080 was 25% faster than the Titan X
while the 1070 matched the type next
making is slightly faster than the fury
acts and 980ti graphics cards this is
where Nvidia's new 16 nanometer FinFET
GPUs really shine efficiency despite
significantly outperforming the Titan X
the 1080 consumed considerably less
power the same is true for the 1070
which provided tight next performance
and a fraction of the power cost okay so
this time around rather than go through
all 20 plus games individually let's
take a look at the results averaged out
across a number of GPU comparisons just
took a serious amount of time to put
together so I hope you guys enjoy the
results let's get to it shall we first
let's take a look at the geforce gtx
1070 data when testing at 1080p the 1070
was an average to 17% slower than the
1080 though keep in mind the faster 1080
is likely running into CPU bottlenecks
than some of these titles even with the
6700 K clock to 4.5 gigahertz the 1070
does lag a little further behind the
1080 or 1440p is the more powerful
graphics card is able to stretch its
legs a little more at this higher
resolution still it should be just 20%
slower is an impressive result for the
considerably more affordable graphics
card
compared to the Titan X the 1070 was an
average 4% faster at 1080p losing out
early in Star Wars Battlefront armor
Anna and The Witcher it's
1070 enjoyed strong winds and hitman
ashes of the singularity and call of
duty black ops 3 the 1070 is now just 3%
faster on average when compared to the
Titan X of 1440p that said not a great
deal has changed here over the 1080p
results up against the 980ti the 1070
was an average 7% faster at 1080p the
only game with his 1070 lagged behind
was The Witcher 3 by slim 4% margin
other than that the 1070 was able to put
the 980ti in its rearview mirrors the
1070 is now 8 percent faster on average
when compared to the 980ti 1440p again
this is similar to the 1080p result and
a good showing for the 1070 now for the
comparison I'm sure all of you Chi CX
970 owners are interested in at 1080p
the 1070 was on average 50% faster than
the 917 at times it was up to 61 percent
faster in games such as Far Cry primal
and hitman ARMA 3 was the only game
where we didn't see 30% plus gains and
this is likely down to a CPU bottleneck
at 1080p the 1070 managed to extend its
lead over the 970 at 1440 payouts with
55% margin with the CPU bottleneck
removed the 1070 is now a great deal
faster in ARMA 3 like GTX 970 owners
those rocking in AI 939 is standard gain
a significant boost in performance when
upgrading to the 1070 on average we saw
a 51 percent boost unsurprisingly the
only games to see minimal gains were
ashes of the singularity and hitman both
AMD sponsored DirectX 12 titles that
make good use of async compute the 1070
was an average 46% faster than the
unknow and 390 or 1440p one of the main
reasons the 390 was able to slightly
recover at this high resolution is down
to the AMD driver overhead issue that
plagues the Radeon graphics cards and
DirectX 11 titles at lower resolutions
comparing the 1070 to the fury X at
1080p we find that in videos new
mid-range graphics card was an average
16% faster again the only weaknesses
here seen when testing with ashes of the
singularity and hitman moving to 1440p
the 1070 is now 11% faster than the fury
acts and again it's really just those
two DirectX 12 titles that are its
undoing this graph highlights were so
great and horrible about multi-gpu at
the same time when working well we see
the 980ti
sli graphics cards have no trouble
besting the 1080
however when sli scales poorly or is
broken entirely the
for mrs. less-than-desirable give an SLI
only worked well in a few of the 20 plus
games tested the 1080 was able to come
out on top of that battle surprisingly
the 1080 is able to pull slightly
further ahead of the 980ti sli cards at
4k extending the margin just 7% on
average when compared to a single 980ti
the 1080 was considerably faster
providing 35% more performance on
average the 1080 was again dominant over
the 980ti 4k this time winning by 33%
margin on average when compared to the
standard 980 the 1080 was an average 69%
faster of 1440p which is obviously a
considerable margin and great news for
current 980 owners looking to upgrade
the 1080 is able to extend its lead over
the 980 at 4k and as it's now 72% faster
on average the 1080 made short work of
the fury X of 1440p as it provided 39%
more performance now at 4k the margin
between the 1080 and fury acts is
reduced slightly as the 1080 is now 33%
faster on average well there you have a
complete breakdown of the GeForce GTX
1080 and 1070 using the release date WH
QL drivers for now it looks like your
video has the $400 + GPU market all sewn
up so it'll be interesting to see what
kind of damage
AMD can do in the lower price tiers
later this month as mentioned earlier
for those interested I've uploaded all
the graphs to our website the hardware
in box comm here you'll find the
individual results for each game across
three resolutions tested please let me
know if you prefer this style where I
spend more time making comparisons or do
you prefer me to include all the
individual game data
