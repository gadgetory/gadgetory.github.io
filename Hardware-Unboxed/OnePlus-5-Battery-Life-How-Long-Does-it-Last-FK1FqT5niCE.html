unboxed a bit of a break from the usual
stuff on the channel as I wanted to once
again explore smartphones this time the
one plus five this phone has been out on
the market now for a little over a month
and once again it's enticing buyers with
its low price tag for a flagship for
those interested in a full review of the
one plus five and recommend checking out
the review I did for text bots which
pretty much goes through everything you
need to know with what sort of
benchmarks and testing this video though
is only going to cover the area of the
one classifier that I think is the most
important and also the most interesting
and that is its battery life oh and a
big shout-out to gearbest
who provided me with the oneplus 5 to
review for some bizarre reason one plus
it doesn't sell their phones in
australia but you can import one pretty
easily from gearbest in fact they
currently have a deal going where you
can buy a one plus five for four hundred
and seventy US dollars with free
shipping through a coupon code you'll
find the info for that in the
description below so that's actually
cheaper than through oneplus official
site so it's definitely well worth
checking out anyway let's talk about the
battery inside the oneplus 5 we're
looking at a 3300 milliamp hour or 12
point seven one watt hour non removable
lithium polymer battery in this phone
the battery is a hundred mil amp hours
smaller than the one plus three which
equates to a 3% reduction
however the oneplus 3 used a 14
nanometer Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 SOC
the oneplus 5 bump this up to a 10
nanometer Snapdragon 835 so the
increased SOC efficiency helps to offset
the reduction in battery size let's kick
off the benchmarks by looking at web
browsing battery life on Wi-Fi here I
tested all phones in Chrome with a
20-second loop of websites which
simulates fairly typical web browsing
conditions the oneplus 5 doesn't fare
too well in this test falling behind a
number of other current gen flagships
including the Galaxy S 8 plus and pixel
XL it does outperform the LG G 6 and
Huawei p10 both of which are smaller
Hana pets and last a decent 30% longer
than the 1 plus 3 the cheaper
Shammi me 6 though with the same
snapdragon 835 SOC provided more than an
hour extra life in this test performing
the same exact test on 4G LTE rather
than Wi-Fi leads to different results as
is the case with most phones backs life
is reduced when switching off Wi-Fi
almost by two hours for the 1 plus 5 the
position of the phone is still roughly
the same compared to other flagships
falling again behind the gates Si and
pixel XL though now by smaller margins
the Huawei Pete and manages to pull
ahead due to the Tara 9 6 DS rather
efficient LTE modem relative to its
Wi-Fi modem PC mark is a great
all-around battery test simulating a
number of different workloads in a
looping fashion Snapdragon SOC s tend to
be pretty efficient in processor heavy
loads and this is obviously the case
when looking at PC mark results the 1+5
pulls ahead of the external powered
galaxy s 8 plus and the Huawei p10 and
then just to get a comfortable gap on
the LG G 6 and pixel Excel you can see
the efficiency gains of the Snapdragon
835 at play here because while the
Snapdragon 820 one powered pixel XL
pulled ahead in those web browsing tests
we were just looking at it did fall
behind in piecing mark again the
cheapest Xiaomi me6 holds top spot here
with the great results PC mark provides
a second more intensive test so it's
worth looking at that to Bachelor life
is reduced across the board in the PC
mark work 2.0 tests but the ordering of
bones day is pretty similar in some
cases such as with the Galaxy S 8 plus
the margin between it and the oneplus 5
gets larger in this other test the one
plus 5 is a phone that doesn't throttle
significantly at least compared to other
flagship so it's no surprise the handset
struggles in the GFX bench Manhattan 3.1
GPU intensive battery test when you
don't floral you burn through battery
quicker than other handsets which is why
the oneplus 5 comes second last year
only outperforming 1+3
while you will get decent sustained
gaming performance the 1+5 does run hot
and phones like the LG g5 have the
ability to last almost an hour longer
moving back to Chrome now to test
Basemark web 3.0 which is a processor
intensive in browser workload the 1+5
improves the other one plus threes time
in this test by more than an hour and
remain
is quite competitive with other
flagships of today it is been once again
by the showing me six though the results
here aren't bad I'll finish up the
battery results here with two video
playback tests the first is a local test
with a 1080p video with the screen set
to maximum brightness the result here
isn't a time which the score that's a
reflection of relative battery life
going to score higher lasts longer at a
higher brightness which is what most
people are after the one plus five
performs really well in this test thanks
to its AMOLED display and a highly
efficient SOC for low-power tasks like
1080p video decoding the one plus five
also dominates the second video playback
test this time I'm streaming a 4k HEV C
video from my local media server over
Wi-Fi to the device and then playing it
back at a bright 300 nits the Snapdragon
835 supports hardware for KH gvc
decoding or well this isn't as efficient
is 1080p decoding the 1+5 stool tops the
charts here some phone struggled badly
with this test but not the one pacifier
at all before I wrap up I'll also look
at charge times the one plus five comes
with - charging which is the company's
proprietary fast charging technology the
rivals Qualcomm quick charge and the
like oneplus claims - charging is faster
than the competition and they're almost
correct I guess looking at burst
charging where the phone is charged 60%
from 20 to 80 percent ball the oneplus 5
achieved this feat just two minutes
faster than the Xiaomi six which uses a
rival fast charge technology two minutes
is a pretty slim margin but I guess
falling at the top of the charts is
still nice when looking at total charge
times the 1 plus 5 result is impressive
at 1 hour and 40 minutes it doesn't
dominate the competition
but it's not slow and that's generally
what I look for looking across the
results reveals the 1 plus 5 is a decent
performance - Bachelor life but it's
definitely not the best smartphone in
the market in this regard as far as
budget phones are concerned I've still
be looking at the show-me me sticks over
the 1 plus 5 because it's not only
cheaper but it also lasts longer and who
doesn't want to last longer if you're
interested in 1 plus 5 don't forget to
check out the best we're selling the
product for less than one
themselves links to that in the
description I've also put links in for
the Shamy me six down there I think
that's a great phone into well worth
checking out as well as the one plus
five euros each for text one so a lot of
links down below
definitely check all of those out I've
got some exciting stuff in the works as
far as laptops are concerned in a couple
of weeks Steve has some how do I put
this NDA content in the works if you
know what I mean so there's definitely
lots of check back on Hardware boxing I
hope you join us in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
