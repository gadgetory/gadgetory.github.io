more rising content I promise that huge
rx 580 vs GTX 1060 showdown is in coming
soon in the meantime this will have to
do a comparison between the horizon v
1400 and 1500 X both are quad core parts
featuring SMT support for a grand total
of eight threads two weeks ago we got
our first look at the horizon 5 Series
but unfortunately at the time I didn't
have the six core 1600 and 4 core 1400
in hand instead I reviewed the 1600 X
and 1500 X as it turns out the two
hundred and $20 u.s. or $300 e6 core
1600 is the golden processor of the
horizon 5 Series that said as good as
the 1600 is I was still very pleased
with how the quad core 1500 X handled
itself so me this was pretty great news
and not because the 1500 X is
particularly great value at 190 us or
$275 Aussie but because it should mean
the cheaper 1400 will be an awesome
option for bargain hunters the 1400 is
priced alongside intel's dual-core 73
50k and although it's only 23 percent
cheaper than the 1600 that hundred and
seventy dollar US or two hundred and $45
ozzie asking price makes it much more
attainable for most users there is
however a possible catch the 1400
features half as much level 3 cache as
these slightly more expensive 1500 X
whereas the 1500 X packs a massive 16
megabyte level 3 cache the 1400 has a
more mainstream core i7 like eight
megabyte level 3 cache a megabytes are
still quite a lot though so what if any
kind of impact does this have on the
1400 this is the question a good many of
you have been asking me over the past
week so here we are time to find out and
I guess I would say for gamers the
reduce level 3 cache capacity will have
minimal impact that being the case I'd
recommend gamers save a little by
getting the 1400 and overclocking the
snot out of it however I never like to
assume these things not when a little
benchmarking can lead us to the truth so
in total we have tested 6 games using
the GeForce GTX
tonight ETI along with a more realistic
configuration using the Radeon our X 480
though be aware those results will be
mostly GPU bound then of course for
comparison we have these 1400 and 1500 X
which have been tested out of the box as
well as a 4 gigahertz clock for clock
configuration which should be most
telling finally the latest display
drivers were installed and both CPUs
were tested with ddr4 2933 memory this
is the fastest memory speed I can run
with these processors for now finally
with the exception of ashes of the
singularity all games have been tested
using DirectX 11 to avoid the
performance problems rise and phases
when using DirectX 12 with an NVIDIA GPU
starting with Battlefield one now if you
move to the lower half of the graph we
have the 1500 X and 1400 tested using
their stock clock speeds with the GTX 10
atti
here the 1500 X was 12% faster when
looking at the average framerate and 16%
for the minimum of course the 1500 X is
clocked up to 13% higher out of the box
so how do they compare clock for clock
at 4 gigahertz
well the margins are much similar here
the 1500 X is just 4% faster for the
average though it is still 7% faster
when looking at the minimum now with a
mid-range graphics card installed in the
form of the Radeon our X 480 we see that
the margins are completely neutralized
here the 1500 X and 1400 look much the
same as they are faced with a GPU
limited scenario this time when testing
with Deus Ex mankind of either we see
that the 1500 X is 16 percent faster out
of the box actually if we look at the
point one percent frame time or the
minimum frame rate it is in fact 22
percent faster
overclocking the CPUs to 4 gigahertz
helps to reduce the margin quite
considerably now these fats are 1500 X
is just 5% faster for both the average
and minimum results basically that means
having all that extra cash only led to a
mere 5% increase in this title once
again we find when using a more
mainstream graphics card the margins
close right up even when comparing the
out-of-the-box configurations comparing
the clock for clock performance at 4
gigahertz we find virtually no
difference between the two CPUs hitman
is a very CPU intensive title and here
we see with the gtx 1080i that the 1500
x
good bit faster out-of-the-box providing
12% more frames on average interestingly
this time when overclocked the 1500 X
managed to maintain a 7% performance
advantage over the 1400 in fact with the
our X 480 handling the rendering work
the 1500 X was still able to flex its
muscles and provide a little extra
performance over the 1400 that said
though when comparing the average frame
rate for the clock for clock comparison
the 1500 X was just 4% faster
mafia 3 has some fairly typical results
for us out of the box the 1500 X was 12%
faster than the 1400 while that margin
was reduced to 7% when comparing the
clock for clock for gear hurts
performance the our X 480 results are
quite typical at least once the cpus are
overclocked oddly though at their stock
speeds the 1500 X was 19% faster which
is a surprising result with the AMD GPU
that said once overclocked to the 1400
did match the 1500 X total war Warhammer
is another very CPU intensive video game
and here the 1500 X was 16% faster when
comparing these stock performance with
both CPUs overclocked 2 though 2 4
gigahertz the 1500 X was still 10%
faster which is quite a large margin
considering the only difference here is
the level 3 cache capacity however once
we drop in the our X 480 that margin is
reduced to nothing and now we find the
same performance from both processors
even before any other clocking takes
place like warhammer ashes of the
singularity is another CPU torture test
before any overclocking takes place the
1500 X is seen delivering 7% more
performance which actually isn't that
much more for this kind of title
interestingly even once overclocked that
margin remains much the same the frame
rate has increased for both CPUs but the
1500 X remains 7% faster as we found
multiple times already running with the
our X 480 does once again change the
story the 1500 X might be 6% faster out
of the box but once we overclock both
CPUs the margin is again reduced to
nothing okay so we clearly saw some
differences when comparing the 1400 and
1500 X at the same clock speed which was
interesting that said this was really
only noticeable with an extreme high end
GPU for the most part performance looked
much the same I went asking the are X
480 with the rendering work
of course this is due to the fact that
we are mostly GPU bound here keeping
that in mind let's focus our attention
towards the average views for the five
games tested using the gtx 1080i and
please no ashes of the singularity has
been dropped as i didn't measure frame
time performance in that title here we
see that out of the box without any
tweaking the 1500 X was on average 12%
faster than the 1400 when looking at the
average frame rate that margin is
extended ever so slightly to 14% we're
looking at the minimum or 0.1% result
depending on the workload the 1500 X is
clocked between 8 and 13 percent faster
than the 1400 so these margins make
sense
removing the clock speed variation by
running both processes and all of their
cores at 4 gigahertz we see that on
average the 1500 X was still 5% faster
when comparing the average frame rate
and 7% faster if you look at the minimum
results so that extra level 3 cache
clearly makes a difference for gaming
albeit not a terribly significant one
still when you consider the fact that
1500 X does cost just 12% more and we
saw on average a 7% boost to the minimum
frame rate you have to wonder if it's
worth buying the 1400 at all that said
if you are using a mid-range graphics
card such as the rx 480 or now rx 580 or
the gtx 1060 then the clock for clock
performance is neutralized in almost all
the games tested also keep in mind that
we did stick to mostly testing with CPU
intensive games
therefore games that are mostly GPU
bound such as titanfall 2
Call of Duty infinite warfare or for
honor for example those games will
struggle to take advantage of the 1500
X's larger cache so I think you really
have to take a step back and work out
who would buy the r5 1400 and why
clearly this is a processor designed for
someone on a tight budget it doesn't
want to settle for a dual core Core i3
or a locked core i5 after all you do get
four cores and eight threads with the
1400 so it's not exactly going to become
inadequate any time soon
chances are if you're playing around
with what was previously core i3 73 50k
money you're not in the market for a
geforce gtx 1080i rather the RX 480 or
RX 580 is going to fit the bill a little
better at these price points saving
every dollar really helps and while
having a full 16 megabyte level
three cash would be nice if it's not
going to net you anymore performance
with your setup then what's the point
there's also that vicious cycle of
spending if you're going to spend $20
more to get the full fat quad-core why
not spend another $30 to get the six
core 12 threads 1,600 this is the
conundrum many consumers are facing at
the moment if you're on a tight budget I
would recommend picking up the 4,100
rather than stretching the budget to the
1600 for gamers if you're going to come
up with that extra $50 you're much
better off investing that money back
into your GPU instead after all that's
the difference between a gtx 1050 and an
RX 570 for example i can already
envision the comments-section now Steve
can you compare the 1400 AD 1604
gigahertz damn it why didn't I do that
in this video I really do need to get on
to that massive rx 580 versus gtx 1060
comparison though finally they before
wrapping things up i should note that
the 1400 comes with the smaller wraith
stealth cooler and their 65 watt model
won't support the 4 gigahertz overclock
sharing this video so you will have to
spend at least $20 on a basic taylor
style cooler now if you plan to push the
1500 x 2 4 gigahertz or try for four
point one of you goods then an upgraded
cooler will probably be in order as well
well I hope this video has at least help
you narrow the choice between the 1400
and the 1500 X and possibly even the
1600 even though that model wasn't
included
ultimately though if you are mindful of
the hardware in your system then it
might not actually make sense to
overextend on the CPU front and remember
every dollar you save now can be put
towards upgrading to Rison 2 down the
track and this is probably a more
sensible choice for budget gamers
because a 6 core 8 core CPU will
probably be more beneficial in a year or
so as time and that's all for this one
time to wrap things up if you liked the
video please hit the like button you
haven't subscribed already then I
recommend you do so so you won't miss
other videos like this and speaking of
other videos I'm in the process of
setting up the patreon account for a
harbor unboxed so if you would like to
make a small donation each month that
would be greatly appreciated as you
probably aware google's adsense isn't
paying particularly well these days not
paying that well previously but it's
even worse now so yeah we've turned the
patron so hopefully you guys that
appreciate the content we do can make a
small contribution again we would really
appreciate that
anyway I'm your host Steve thanks for
watching I'll see you guys again soon
