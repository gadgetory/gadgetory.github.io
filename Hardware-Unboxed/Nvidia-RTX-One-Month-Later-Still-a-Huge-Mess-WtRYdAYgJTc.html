almost a month since invidious new
g-force r-tx graphics cards were
officially released the actual
month-aversary is in a few days but
that's when we will be talking about
Intel's nitrogen processes so I guess
now is as good a time as any anyway I
thought it would be a good idea to look
at the current state of invidious RT X
lineup and see how things have
progressed since the very massive launch
back in September let's start with the
RT X 2080 the first card you could
actually buy and the only one that
actually launched on September 20th this
GPU has been well fairly easy to buy at
most major retailers it seems there's
plenty of stock lb @ at higher prices in
fact stock levels are so good it appears
that 2080s aren't exactly flying off the
shelves which shouldn't come as a
surprise considering our review and many
others criticized the card for being
poor value 2080 sales have been so
lackluster that we didn't see a single
RT X 2080 sail through our Amazon
affiliate links since the card was
announced on August 21st in that same
time period seventeen people bought a
GTX 10 ATT I most of which came after
our review of the 28 he went live again
that's not a surprise because the 1080
is much better value right now and
delivers roughly the same performance as
the 2080 despite an abundance of 2080s
on the market in plentiful stock not a
single variant is being sold at the AIB
MSRP nearly a month after launch as we
expected and talked about in our initial
review even though the card does have a
699 US dollar MSRP for board partners
basically every card on the market is
being solid the founders edition price
of $7.99 or even higher than that and
it's not like prices have been coming
down what you see at Amazon or Newegg
are basically the same prices as at
launch what's crazy about this is that
instead of cutting the price of the 2080
to the aib MSRP a price nvidia
specifically announced at launch and
which actually makes the card
competitive with the 1080 TI o EMS are
choosing to bundle hardware with the
2080 instead browsing you au can quite
easy
they get a free power supply free
motherboard or free hard drive with your
2080 purchase but you can't find a
single card priced at $700 some of the
bundles are actually completely
ridiculous is anyone really spending
more than $900 on an RTX 2080
and 2 terabyte hard drive bundle when a
2 terabyte fire CUDA is only worth $90
making the bundle actually worse value
than buying the GPU and hard drive
separately not to mention you'd be
better off buying the hard drive and a
1080 TI instead and no one is bundling
this free hardware with 1080 T eyes and
this raises the question if companies
are so desperate to move RTX 2080s that
they're bundling in all sorts of very
hardware when will we actually see these
GPUs at the AIB MSRP or is the AIB MSRP
just a complete load of crap we saw
pretty much the same thing happen with
NVIDIA GeForce 10 Series launches with
the split between AIB and founders
Edition pricing and quite frankly if
there are no cards available at the
lower of the two prices at launch
announcing that pricing is pretty
deceptive behavior particularly if it
takes half a year for pricing to filter
down to that lower MSRP because in that
sort of timeframe you'd normally expect
to see a price reduction
as for the RT x28 ETI well this graphics
card is in a similar position to the RT
x 2080 in that not a single car is
listed at its $999 AIB MSRP whereas all
listings for board partner cards are at
the $1,200 founders Edition price but
then you can't even buy it when ATI
anyway because they're all out of stock
and on top of that the card was delayed
from its original September 20th release
to early October this is another bizarre
one because surely Nvidia should have
known that the 2080 ti was the card most
people would have been interested in
buying even at its exorbitantly high
price the 2080 ti does offer a new level
of performance you previously couldn't
get from a non workstation cheaper you
but it seems Nvidia simply didn't make
enough of these GPUs to satisfy demand
even though they are likely selling the
GPU at a pretty hefty margin so with
these two cards a month after launch
we're in a position where the card
people actually want to buy the r-tx 20
le TI isn't in
stocke meanwhile the card no one wants
to buy the ITX 20 and he is in plentiful
stock and even bundled with hardware
though no one is willing to sell the
card at the AIB MSRP that's a pretty
pathetic state of affairs a month after
the release and then there's the r-tx
2070 we're only a day post launch but
again we seem to be in a situation where
very few cards are available at the for
$99 a IB MSRP a few have been listed at
some retailers but most out of stock or
on backorder
instead most kinds of priced at least
$50 over the MSRP if not more this is
despite plenty of stock for all but the
cheapest cards and Nvidia going out of
their way to ensure some reviewers had
$500 board partner cards for their
review another very sloppy release from
Nvidia and a poor one for consumers now
let's talk about the elephant in the
room
RTX features nvidia has basically
completely punched this one even though
the first RTX cards launched about a
month ago there is still zero game is
available today that support either RT x
ray tracing or dl SS in fact we've
really been waiting longer than that
because RT x was shown off in shadow of
the tomb raider in a playable state at
the GeForce 20 series launched in August
since then the launch of the RT x 2080
and 2080 TI has come and then we've seen
a second launch for the RT x 2070 and
yet we still don't even have a release
date for just one of the games that uses
either feature when you dial down on the
list of games there are plenty that
haven't been released at all yet with or
with that ray tracing but there are a
few games that are currently available
that haven't yet been updated to include
RT x features on the ray tracing side
shadow of the Tomb Raider and assetto
corsa competence journey have both been
out for more than a month now and for
DLS s games like pub G shadow of the
Tomb Raider we happy for you final
fantasy 15
Ark survival evolved scum and hell-blade
send you a sacrifice are available to
play right now none featured ELSS and
it's even stranger than that because
NVIDIA has a working functional demo for
DL SS in final fantasy 15 s benchmark
yet
no signs of the game is set to receive a
DL SS update anytime soon we've seen all
the jokes about how RT X ray tracing and
D LSS is supposed to just work but it
seems the reality is far from that
because NVIDIA hasn't managed to get it
working in any actual games you can play
right now a month after the race of the
first RT X cards and longer than that
since the announcement now of course one
of the main limitations to getting ray
tracing in games was on Microsoft's end
they needed to update Windows 10 with
new version of DirectX that included
support for DX r the layer that sits
atop RT X and provides games with a ray
tracing API that update was first
released earlier this month then pulled
due to a bug announced back on track for
a release shortly but even with
Microsoft announcing and launching their
update not a peep about RT X games not
to mention of course the DL SS doesn't
even require the update and we haven't
heard anything about that quite frankly
the lack of RT x enabled games isn't a
massive loss to consumers from what
we've seen in in videos owned DLS s
demos the technology doesn't seem all
that impressive compared to running at
lower than native resolutions as for ray
tracing it looks cool but all the
reports were hearing suggests it's a
massive performance hog and games Nexus
also has a great video on why the visual
effects themselves aren't a significant
step up from techniques we already have
for lighting you should check that out
if you're interested but not having
either of these features ready or
announced to be ready
a month after launch is embarrassing for
NVIDIA these are the features that was
supposed to justify the high price of
the RT X cards relative to the GeForce
10 series not only have review has been
unable to test these features properly
and see whether they actually add value
to RTX cards but consumers buying these
cards today or any time since September
20th have also been unable to use
features Nvidia heavily promoted on
announcement day now a lot of these are
TX complaints you've probably heard
before not just from us in our reviews
of the RT X cards but from many others
however we kind of thought there might
at least be something we could test or
play by now
fine it wasn't available on launch but
surely working demos on announcement day
should have translated to games
consumers can play at this point
if the technology is supposed to just
work this entire launch has been a
complete mess and points to Nvidia
attempting to get these cards out before
they were ready nvidia wasn't ready with
r-tx games to back up their technology
architecture and asking price of their
new GPUs they weren't ready with enough
RTX 20 80 TI stock and weren't ready to
release the card on its initial launch
date they weren't ready to get our TX
2080 cards out at the AIB MSRP they
announced in August and they weren't
ready at all with the r TX 2070 launch
sending out samples at the last second
and scrambling to get cards priced at
the MSRP and I guess all of this once
again points to Nvidia trying to rush
out the GeForce 20 series on 12
nanometer before seven nanometer
production gets into full swing at the
start of 2019 AMD is set to show the
world what they've been working on with
7 nanometer Navi GPUs at CES 2019 in
January and you can bet that in video
also has been working on a new line of
seven nanometer GPUs for release next
year that puts pressure on the company
to get their current products out as
soon as possible before they're truly
ready so they don't become irrelevant
when seven nanometer comes in to town I
also think the disappointment with this
launch has been compounded by the
complete lack of decent high-end GP
releases for well over a year we finally
get a new series of GPUs and what do we
end up with a massively overpriced new
flagship GPU with an actual performance
gain at the top end plus two other
high-end cards that offer worse value
than existing Pascal cars that have been
on the market for nearly two years for
the most part so yeah this is pretty
much we're at roughly a month after the
r-tx launch I'm interested to hear your
thoughts on how Nvidia handled this
launch as well let us know in the
