are going to compare how the risin 9
3,900 ex performs using both the where
is it so here the Wraiths prism RGB box
cooler we're going to compare how it
performs using that as well as a big old
360 millimeter all-in-one liquid cooler
and the particular model I'll be using
for this test is the castle 360 X from
deep cool got the new anti League
technology and all that good stuff
anyway we'll be comparing how those two
coolers perform on the 3100 X and kind
of interesting tests because in my
reviews of the 3700 X and 300 X actually
I did the same for the 36 as well I used
the Box cooler for all of those reviews
though for the 3600 it was the Wraith
stealth yeah getting a bit away from the
point I'm trying to make here I used the
included box coolers and I did this for
a good reason
but I also anticipated doing so would
upset a few AMD fans now I clearly
explained why I used a box cooler but I
gave that explanation knowing full well
that there'd be a few crazy
AMD fans that just wouldn't accept that
and say that I was paid by Intel or
whatever to use the Box cooler which is
obviously a whole load of nonsense but
you know you can't help that sort of
thing it seems anyway the reason I use
the Box coolers because my initial
testing showed that although the 3100 X
and 3700 X did boost better with
improved cooling we were only talking
about very small percentage gains very
very tiny increases in frequency
especially when considering what clock
speeds they ran out anyway with this
cooler so yeah those small increases in
clock speed had a little to no impact on
performance unfortunately some AMD fans
didn't realize I was doing AMD a solid
by testing their CPUs with the included
box cooler as his heavily swing things
in their favor when it came to the cost
analysis I should also note that I
wasn't trying to give AMD an unfair
advantage either rather I just wanted to
leverage what they had to offer I
couldn't very well show performance with
an expensive all-in-one liquid cooler
and then base my price to performance
breakdown on the Box cooler
would be a little underhanded at the
same time I wasn't out to completely
destroy Intel's price to performance
either so I didn't factor in the cost of
the one hundred and sixty five dollar
u.s. Corsair all-in-one liquid cooler
rather a budget for a decent $75 US air
cooler I did this because I already know
that out of the box the core i 919 a
hurricane will deliver the exact same
performance using the be quite dark rock
pro 4 anyway now that I have baseline
performance established I do plan to
provide an extremely in-depth benchmark
later this week comparing the 3100 X and
99 or K head-to-head in over 30 games
both stock and overclocked for these
stock settings our 3100 X will still use
the Box cooler but for the overclocked
results it will be upgraded to the same
liquid cooler used by the Intel
processor but before we do that I
thought it would be a good idea to show
just what kind of a difference upgrading
the cooling makes when it comes to
gaming and application performance and
just quickly before we get into the
benchmark results meet as Rox new
flagship Zed 390 motherboard the phantom
gaming X it's packed with loads of
upgrades including a six hundred amp
capacity 12 phase V core VRM 2.5 Gigabit
LAN with an additional two Gigabit LAN
connectors Wi-Fi six creative Sound
Blaster cinema 5 loads of USB 3.0 ports
SATA ports and m2 ultra ports there's
also a number of really nice design
elements such as integrated i/o shield
stainless steel PCIe covers a massive
heat sink for cooling the MDOT two
drives a metal backplate and much much
more so for more information please
check the link in the video description
we're just finally all testing has been
conducted with the riser 939 rx on the
gigabyte x5 17 horas extreme at using
ddr4 3200 cell 14 memory and the
graphics card of choice is the MSI r-tx
2082 a gaming extra Oh first up let's
just have a look at the average all core
clock speed when running them blender
open data benchmark this is a very heavy
workload so clock speeds are lower than
what you'll see when gaming and running
a less stressful workload also please
note these aren't the peak clock speeds
seen when running this benchmark rather
they are the average so as you can see
the 3100 X in its stock out of the box
trim
four gigahertz in this test with the
Wraiths prism box cooler the castle 360
X did allow the CPU to boost up to four
point one gear Hertz and that's just a
two and a half percent increase
interestingly that margin doesn't change
with PB o plus Auto AC enabled in the
rise and Master software the liquid
cooler still allowed for a two and a
half percent increase in clock speed
averaging just four point one five
gigahertz in this stress test so even if
we compare the stock result using the
Box cooler to the overclocked result
using the liquid cooler we're still only
seeing a four percent increase in
frequency for this test now looking at
the total render time and blender we see
that the liquid cooler improved stock
performance by just a single percent and
we see the same thing when looking at
the overclocked results we're all
certainly looking at a mere one percent
performance difference in corona
basically the upgraded cooler shaves a
second off the completion time so what
about gaming performance which isn't
nearly as CPU demanding at least right
now for a 12 core processor well we see
virtually no change in performance when
upgrading the cooler in Apex legends one
FPS is within the margin of error though
it seemed pretty clear that the slight
increase in frequency did typically
yield better results much the same as
seen when testing with Rainbow six siege
in fact here we see no performance
difference with PB o plus Auto C enabled
it's a bit of a shame you can't squeeze
much more performance out of these third
gen rising processors but I guess that
leaves something for AMD to improve upon
for their next generation vermintide 2
shows up to a one-and-a-half percent
performance improvement from upgrading
the cooler though we do see margins as
small as half a percent so I don't
imagine to many of you will invest money
in an upgraded cooler just for these
mega FPS gains but there is still a
reason to upgrade and we'll discuss that
in a moment
unsurprisingly we see the exact same
story when testing with World of Tanks
he's spending more money by upgrading
the cooling provided no additional
performance so I guess the next question
is then how much cooler is the 3900 X
running with the deep core Castle 360 ax
well the good news is quite a bit cooler
stock the 3900 X drop down from 86
degrees with the Box cooler running at a
very audible 2,900 rpm while the castle
360 X reduced temperatures to just 68
degrees with the three radiator fans
around 1900 rpm so that's an 18 degree
drop in temperature we do see a similar
thing when overclocking here the liquid
cooler was 19 degrees cooler we're also
running a bit quieter however even at
just 1900 rpm 3 120-millimeter fans were
far from silent so let's turn them down
a bit further and see what we end up
with spinning the fans down to just over
a thousand rpm it made the castle 360 X
basically silent there's certainly no
way you'll hear this thing in your
system if you have a few case fans and
yet despite that temperatures only
increase slightly so it seems the real
advantage to using an upgraded cooler
something like this all in one liquid
cooler is the reduction in operating
volume so there you have it
follow these stock configuration the
riser 930 900 X doesn't need a great big
cooler strapped on to it for maximum
performance and it certainly doesn't
require liquid cooling even with PPO
enabled you won't gain much more
performance by upgrading the cooler I'm
not saying you shouldn't upgrade the
cooler mind you I'm it's perfectly
legitimate thing to do if you'll want to
seek lower temperatures and quiet
operating volumes I'm just saying that
it won't improve performance beyond a
few percent as we just saw so for that
reason I decided to test the 3900 X with
the Box cooler so I didn't have to
factor in the cost of additional cooling
such as this thing here when I was
making my cost per frame analysis for
gamers the Wraith prism it is even less
of an issue really because games don't
load up all 12 cores and place them
under excessive load for long periods of
time in fact when gaming the fan speed
was generally around 2,000 rpm anyway so
it was much quieter than what we see
when stress testing with blender for
those that missed it when comparing just
the CPU price the value of these higher
end third generalising parts don't look
so great for gamers the 3900 X for
example costs quite a bit more than the
9900 K while the 3700 X matched the 9700
K however the Intel processors don't
come with a cooler and they demand a
rather good one on the other hand as you
just saw the 3100 X works perfectly fine
with the Box cooler so adding $75 to the
price for the Intel CPUs for something
like the dark rock 4 really changes the
picture now the 3100 X is a whisker
cheaper than
99 or okay while the 3,700 X is a lot
cheaper than the 97 okay and in fact
matches the value of the 9600 K so if
you care about value then the included
box cooler really does help out but on
the other hand if you just want to build
a beastly PC that can smash rendering
tasks faster than any other sub 500 a
CPU and you aren't on a tight budget
then sticking a more effective cooler on
the Theon rx certainly won't hurt so
anyway that's all the testing I'll leave
it up to you guys to decide whether or
not you think it's worth upgrading the
Box cooler does something better
probably depends on what particular
model you're buying all that sort of
stuff anyway let me know in the comments
section below
personally I think ignoring the value of
the Box cooler would have been a mistake
in my day one reviews and well any
review of these third gen parts so
that's just my personal opinion but
again love to know what you guys think
