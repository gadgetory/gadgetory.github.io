keyboard is going to stall bot of the
category for over five years now there's
been many iterations along the way today
we have the pleasure of checking out the
latest offering the Black Widow ultimate
2016 edition featuring razors very own
razor green switches with most brands
getting flashier and flashy er it's nice
to see a brand new premium gaming
keyboard that truly focuses on function
thirst before aesthetics that's not to
say this isn't a nice looking keyboard
it is however the design is relatively
simple and this black metal edition is
an adorned with RGB lighting instead it
sticks to razor's trademark ring which
if you're a loyal fan of the brand's
you'll be pleased to rock now not a
whole lot has change relative to the
Black Widow predecessors however there
are some improvements the overall
footprint of the keyboard is decreased
thanks to the removal of the macro keys
although it's still not a compact
keyboard as mentioned the LEDs are all
green unlike the RGB chroma Edition and
they can of course be turned off
resulting in a very subtle and sleek
looking all-black design physically the
keyboard is already on a bit of a pitch
and I found that I didn't even need to
prop it up on a tie and legs I'll do the
option is there the black textured
finish is both nice to look at and to
touch it definitely seems fairly smudge
resistant as to the keycaps
Razer synapse software is
straightforward to use probably one of
the simplest I've seen if I'm honest you
can easily configure profiles and link
them to different programs enable gaming
mode where you can disable certain key
combinations like alt tab and the
Windows key you can of course play
around with the lining effects there are
six inbuild effects that are all pretty
cool and you can customize them further
with game genre templates too despite
the lack of dedicated macro keys macros
can still be assigned to any key you
like its most software Suites allow you
to do these days I wasn't really a fan
of having to sign up and create a Razer
account just use the software but I'm
yet to receive any newsletters or spam -
so it's not so bad and I can see it if
you had raising components in multiple
locations and the cloud features would
be pretty handy - I was pleased to see
the continued inclusion of a USB
pass-through
an audio pass-through is also included
form of combine speaker and mic cable
and three and a half millimeter jack
this pop out of the right side of the
keyboard and the grape for poppy and
headphones a USB stick or any other USB
device this keyboard is my first
experience with raisin screen switches
and I was a fan the very reminiscent of
Cherry MX blues which I use as my daily
drivers when I'm not testing new
mechanical keyboard so I found the
transition very easy I feel a little
more resistant than the cherries and the
clicky feedback is a little less clicky
I don't really know how to describe it
performance wise the Black Widow lives
up to its lineage and I've no problems
whatsoever recommending the 2016 edition
both casual and serious gamers a liar
coming into the great price buying a
$179 dollars and 110 dollars in USA it's
very good value I'd only recommend
trying to give one a bit of a test run
first to make sure you like the key
switches which edition of the Black
Widow is your favorite would you prefer
the smaller footprint 2016 edition that
fur goes the macro keys let me know in
