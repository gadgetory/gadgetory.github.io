of weeks ago you might have seen our
coverage of Intel's KB Lake G processor
a combination of a quad core cable X CPU
with an AMD Radeon rx Vega M GPU and
four gigabytes of HB m2 on a single
package we've already gone through all
the performance numbers and game demos
you could possibly want
now let's discuss whether it's actually
worth buying the first cable 8g laptop
the Dell XPS 15 2 in one as the name of
this laptop suggests we're looking at a
convertible laptop here with a 360
degree hinge you can use it as a giant
15.6 inch tablet or in more useful span
and tent modes at this size I don't find
the tween one aspect of this laptop all
that useful most convertibles are
sticked using as a laptop anyway but
when we're talking about a 15 inch
system the size makes some of those
other usage modes less practical the
hinge is sturdy and easy to operate
though and there aren't any noticeable
compromises that affect the laptop
experience this is still a laptop first
and other usage mode second which is the
right approach to take with this sort of
device in terms of build quality we're
looking at the same excellent build as
Dells entire XPS line and you get a
beautiful matte metal on the lid and
base along with a soft touch carbon
fiber styled keyboard surround it's a
very sturdy laptop thanks to that
combination of materials plus it has a
nice premium touch that you really
should be getting at this price point it
wouldn't be an XPS laptop without a slim
bezel display so you're getting that
here as well I still think Dell does the
best slim bezel laptops out there and
it's awesome to get it in not just the
13-inch form factors but 15-inch as well
unfortunately the trade-off for such
slim bezels is the nostril vision camera
position below the display which isn't
great for frequent webcam uses but the
slimmer bezels do allow the laptop to
take up a smaller footprint and while
not a small or particularly portable
laptop due to its large 15-inch screen
it's one of the smallest devices you can
get in its class
the thickest parts are just sixteen
millimeters thick and that tapers down
nicely and overall it weighs just two
kilograms ideally I'd like to see that
weight come down a tad but you are
getting a 75 watt hour battery insight
along with the premium aluminium
construction and both of those things
add to the way
the port selection is pretty lacking on
the XPS 15 to n1 especially compared to
the non convertible XPS 15 there isn't a
single USB a port on this device still
has instead opted for two Thunderbolt
three ports on the left and two USB C
3.1 ports on the right the USB C 3.1
points double as DisplayPort outputs but
there is no commonly used display
connector on this device and while dual
Thunderbolt 3 is nice the lack of USBA
is annoying if you want to use many
common peripherals without a dongle as
the market transitions to USB C I still
think it's critical to include at least
one USB a port and other sides are quite
thin I think a slight design revision
could have allowed full-size USB here
you also get a 3.5 ml headphone jack and
a micro SD card slot again it would have
made more sense to have a full SD slot
here especially as the laptop is
designed for creative professionals both
a full SD slot and a USB a port are
included with the regular Dell XPS 15 so
it's disappointing to see the two-in-one
cut these features the keyboard uses
Dells shallower XPS K design used across
their 2 in 1 laptops which provides
slightly less feedback than the deeper
keys with a longer travel on the
non-convertible
XPS s the keyboard here is fine it's not
bad but it's not particularly satisfying
to type on and I definitely prefer this
standard XPS keyboard over this one it's
also a bit disappointing that this 15
inch laptop does not include a numpad
but that does allow the keyboard to take
center stage the trackpad is good on
Power Cells other XPS laptops and I like
the inclusion of a fingerprint reader in
the power button the nostril vision
camera array also supports Windows holo
facial recognition if you prefer that
for authentication the display it's
available in either 1080p or 4k
resolutions both are 15.6 inch IPS LCD
panels and both include touchscreens I
received the 4k mode to review and it
packs a hundred percent Adobe RGB gamut
coverage so it's perfect for content
creators that need the extra color space
in typical Dell fashion this is a
professional-grade display that includes
features designed for creators their
premiere color utility allows you to
choose between several display modes
including a vibrant mode with proper
color management that allows you to get
the most out of your display on with
additional modes that can clamp the
screen to DCI p3 srgb or Adobe RGB
depending on you
this is super handy if you're using an
app that doesn't handle color management
well yet you require those larger gamuts
without going into a ton of detail the
4k display here performs well with
brightness above 400 nits a strong
contrast ratio of 1660 to 1 and average
Delta is around the 3.0 mark in a
default mode when measuring against srgb
and that can be further tightened by
selecting a specific mode and both the
DCI p3 and Adobe RGB modes provide near
full coverage of those respective gamut
so it's a very good display all around
performance is something I've covered in
detail in another video so I'd highly
recommend checking out my review of KB
Lake G for a full breakdown of how this
exact model performs but I will briefly
summarize my findings here quickly for
those that just want you know a brief
overview the latest Dell XPS 15 21 95 75
comes with an intel core i7 8700 5g in
the upper end models or an i5 83 o5g in
the lower models both of which are 65
watt KB Lake G parts with a quad core
CPU and 20 compute unit Vega GPUs my
review unit as configured came with 16
gigabytes of ddr4 2400 memory although 8
gigabytes appears to be the standard
across most models that said like with a
lot of Dell systems you have the option
to configure both storage and memory
through their website CPU performance is
good
slightly outperforming the last gen cry
7 7700 HQ though falling short of the
newer six core coffee-like laptop CPUs
like the cry 78758 dat 705 G's also a
fair bit faster than 15 what you serious
processes like the I 78550 you despite
both being quad-core so if you're
tossing it between this and something
like a Dell XPS 13 the 15-inch 2 and 1
is a decent amount faster as far as
graphics performance is concerned the
Vega M GPU with 20 compute units sits
around the same level as an nvidia
geforce gtx 1050 or 1050 Ti so it's
great for accelerating compute workloads
like Adobe Premiere while also being
capable of gaming at 1080p with medium
ish settings in the latest tiles
Fortnight is a great example of a game
that runs extremely well on this laptop
despite its thinness all up cable AG is
a pretty impressive chip though it can't
match the performance offered by the
Dell XPS 15 with its combination number
six Core i7
8750 H and G
Tex 10:50 TI graphics so if you'd rather
ditch the two-in-one design and 360
degree hinge for faster internals the
XPS 15 might be more up your alley my
review unit was kitted out with plenty
of storage as it includes a one terabyte
SK Hynix PC 401 nvme PCIe REM Drive this
SSD is fast without blowing me away
something like the Samsung PM 981 we're
seeing in a lot of other high end
laptops these days is noticeably faster
in sequential rates and writes although
this SK Hynix Drive performs very well
in random speed tests getting the one
terabyte SSD though is very expensive so
I'd probably stick to 512 gigabytes for
most buyers thermal performance is an
interesting one as the temperatures of
the CPU and GPU varied depending on the
workload split for example if the CPU is
the only component being used it reaches
a peak of 85 degrees Celsius however if
it's being used alongside the GPU in a
stress test the CPU hits just 75 degrees
and the GPU 67 degrees and in gaming the
CPU is a little cooler at around 72
degrees Celsius while the GPU stays at
that same 67 degree figure these figures
are quite good but it does come at a
cost the cooler isn't particularly quiet
reaching 43 point for DBA
in both gaming and video encoding stress
tests that gaming result isn't too bad
but when slamming the CPU in a render
it's quite loud compared to other
devices surface temperatures were also
very hot the area around the f4 key
reached nearly 50 degrees Celsius and
the entire right side of the keyboard
was above 45 degrees including the WASD
Keys while gaming you'll have to put up
with the keyboard acting as a bit of a
hand warmer there the XPS 15 21 does
come with a 75 watt hour battery which
is on the lower end of the battery range
for 15-inch ultra portables but it is
still good enough for decent amounts of
life like a lot of these sorts of
systems the 95 75 will give you better
battery life than a gaming laptop even
one with a large batch like the gigabyte
error 15 X but it won't last as long as
a smaller 13 inch device with a 15 watt
CPU like a lot of modern portable
laptops there's a lot to like about the
Dell XPS 15 - in one this machine has a
great build a solid 360-degree hinge a
great display good performance and so on
there are a few annoyances here and
there like the lack of a you
be a port and a shallow keyboard but
overall it's a good system that buyers
will like and as far as 15 inch
convertibles go the XPS 15 95 75 would
be right up there as one of the best
however I think a lot of prospective
buyers would be better off with a non
convertible Dell XPS 15 it's kind of
neat to have the 360 degree hinge but
the size of this 15 inch laptop makes it
difficult to get the most out of the
tablet and other form factors with
13-inch convertibles it's a lot easier
to make use of the tablet motors they're
smaller and lighter but the XPS 15 2 &amp;amp; 1
is a 2 kilogram based and best suited to
use on a desk in laptop mode that's not
to say you shouldn't consider the XPS 15
to anyone especially if you're an artist
that wants to make use of the included
pen to draw in the display in its stand
mode I just think for most other
professionals that wouldn't use that
feature and would rarely take advantage
of the 360 degree hinge the XPS 15 with
its faster processor a larger battery
and wider port selection is a much
better option especially when you
consider the XPS 15 is at least 130
dollars cheaper for an equivalent
configuration if not more when the XPS
15 2 in one isn't discounted through
Dells website speaking of price the XPS
15 21 definitely isn't cheap a model
with just the core 787 o5g eight
gigabytes of RAM and 256 gig of storage
will set you back one thousand five
hundred and twenty nine dollars right
now down from an MSRP of seventeen
hundred dollars that price quickly jumps
to over seventeen fifty dollars if you
want a decent 16 gig of ram and 512
gigabytes of storage while the 4k screen
is an additional 400 bucks my review now
has configured with a one terabyte SSD
is an eye-watering 2400 us and if I told
you this very unit was 4200 Australian
dollars which includes more than 600
bucks of Australia tax you probably be
even less impressed that's it for this
review of the Dell XPS 15 21 if you're
interested in more in-depth performance
numbers I'd recommend going back and
checking our previous coverage of KB
