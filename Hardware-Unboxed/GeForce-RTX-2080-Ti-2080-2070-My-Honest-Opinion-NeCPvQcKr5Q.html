are talking about and videos
announcement of their upcoming GeForce
20 series at 2:00 a.m. in the morning
and that's 2 a.m. my time
Nvidia hold their games con 2018 keynote
and as expected announced their next
generation GeForce hardware and began
taking pre-orders as always we don't
recommend you get involved in the pre
ordering process and we highly recommend
that you just wait and check out the day
1 reviews so in case you missed it and
video will be releasing at the RT X 2080
and our TX 2080 ti rather than the usual
base model 80 and 70 cards at launch I
think I know why we are seeing the 2080
ti at the initial launch which is
something we don't normally see but I
will talk about that towards the end of
the video and give a few of my personal
opinions there for now though let's go
over the official information than
nvidia has given us for now we have
details regarding the RT x 28 e TI RT x
20 80 and RT x 27 the 20 80 models will
be hitting streets on the 20th of
september next month while the 2070 will
be coming the following month in october
as you might have guessed the 20 80 TI
is indeed the flagship part while the 20
80 is the high-end model with the 27 t
being a slightly cheaper high-end model
designed for enthusiasts who don't want
to break the bank though given the MSRP
s that one's a bit laughable at this
point so as I said in video releasing
the 20 80 models first this time and
they will be available in a month's time
but as of today they're taking
pre-orders pre-orders a whole month in
advance and you might think well ok
maybe the pricing is reasonable hmm
maybe not the 2080 ti starts at an MSRP
of $1,000 u.s. and that is for the
partner cards and then $1200 us for the
founders edition version so we're
talking Titan XP money meanwhile the
vanilla 2080 that one is starting at
$700 u.s. for the partner models and an
$800 US for the foundation and then
capping off the high end we have the
2070 which we're coming in at $500 u.s.
or $600 us for the FAK
so this means gamers are looking at
having to spend between 100 and 300
dollars us more for an equivalent model
from the past generation and then on top
of that the Effie models carry a further
100 $200 u.s. price premium and you just
know that these are going to be the only
models available from time to time again
I'll discuss more of my thoughts on
pricing and availability towards the end
of the video
Alicia's got all aspects out of the way
first all the official information that
NVIDIA has given us the new 20 series is
based upon 10 videos cheering
architecture and as the RT X in the name
suggests rage racing it's all the rage
now basically what we have here is a
type of hybrid rendering that combines a
ray tracing with traditional
rasterization so along with the new
tensor cause we're also getting RT cores
in video States the fastest geforce r-tx
model can cast 10 billion rays per
second which compared to the
unaccelerated pascal is a 25 times
improvement in ray tracing performance
however today's games don't use ray
tracing as it's extremely slow on
current hardware so it's hard to say
exactly what the benefits of hybrid
rendering will be for gamers it really
depends on how heavily future games
implement that technology so there
really isn't much to comment on right
now what will tell us a great deal about
how these new churring GPUs are going to
perform are the core and clock
specifications along with a few other
tidbits the RT X 20 atti packs 4352 cuda
cores
that's a 21 percent increase over the
GTX 1080 Ti and this along with the
tensor and RT cause has seen the GPU die
size increased by a massive 60% this in
itself helps explain why this part is so
damn expensive that and of course the
complete lack of competition but we'll
touch on that later in the video
although these new GPUs are manufactured
using TSM C's 12 nanometer FinFET Nvidia
process it's basically just 16 animes
with a larger reticle limit performance
wise they are identical according to TSM
C which explains the clock speeds
speaking of which the 4352 cores are
clocked at a base frequency of 1,350
mega Hertz with a boost clock of fifteen
hundred and forty five megahertz which
is comparable to the 1080 Ti I should
know that the EFI models do come
overclocked with a boost
of 1635 megahertz but of course that's
pretty much going to be the same on all
the partner cards as well anyway so
somewhat of a moot point then we have an
11 gigabyte frame buffer using 14
gigabits per second G DDR 6 memory on a
352 bit wide memory bus and that affords
the card a memory bandwidth of 616
gigabytes per second the plain old r-tx
20 80 comes with 2944 CUDA cores a base
clock speed of 1,550 megahertz and a
boost clock of 1700 and 10 megahertz but
again the EFI model is overclocked to
this time to 1.8 gigahertz and used to
the same for 10 gigabits per second G
DDR 6 memory but on a slimmer 256-bit
wide memory bus free bandwidth of 448
gigabytes per second oh and there's 8
gigabytes of memory in total then we
have the RT X 2017 which packs 2304 CUDA
cores a fourteen hundred and ten
megahertz base clock and a boost clock
of sixteen hundred and twenty megahertz
or seventeen hundred and ten megahertz
for the EFI model again eight gigabytes
of 14 gigabits per second GDR six memory
is used on a 256 wide memory bus for the
same four hundred and forty eight
gigabytes per second of memory bandwidth
as noted earlier the 20 atti packs 10
gig arrays per second of ray-tracing
performance and this figure has been
reduced by 20% for the standard twenty
eighty eight years per second and then
the RT x 27 t packs six euros per second
a 40 percent reduction from the flagship
at this point we have no idea what this
really means is six gig arrays per
second even going to be useful suppose
only time will tell
personally I'm not particularly rapt
with the design of the new EFI models I
really liked the look of the GeForce 10
series EFI cards and middlee performance
wasn't great but at least they did look
nice this new version though looks
world's better in terms of cooling
performance but I think the design
itself is a bit ugly but I am interested
to see if my opinion changes on this
matter once I have one in hand
finally like the 1080 TI the 2080 TI is
a 250 watt part then the vanilla
2080 is a 215 what part that's 35 Watts
over the 1080 and then the 27 t comes in
and 185 watts and again that's 35 watts
over the Pascal equivalent so those are
the key specifications for each model
we can take a pretty good stab at how
each GPU will perform in today's games
the Turing streaming multiprocessors
have been slightly refined featuring
some of the upgrades that came with the
Volta architecture such as dedicated
integer cores
unified cache and variable rate shading
though it is hard to say what if any
advantages will give chirring in today's
games over pascal my guess is there will
be pretty much no performance uplift to
be seen given that video didn't show a
single non rate racing demo so there's
likely going to be zero IPC gains the
demos that they did show were quite
impressive for the most part but they
weren't exactly flawless I did notice
quite a few odd glitches when looking
closely there are a number of artifacts
to be seen and there is a bit of odd
stuttering going on as well the
performance it also appears to be rather
massive the trimmer and a demo looked to
have the framerate just about halved
with r-tx enabled but that's just based
on the footage we saw and of course
there was no framerate data or anything
like that provided so I'm purely
guessing but still I'm Julius of just
how useful this initial implementation
of this technology is going to be
assuming things remain much the same for
today's games and those being released
in the near future we aren't talking
about big performance gains here at most
I am I do mean at most here the arch x20
atti should be 20% fast in the GTX 1080i
again at most but the cost well that'll
be at least 40% more if we go by the
MSRP
however for at least this year the MSRP
will likely mean nothing as your chances
of getting a partner card for $1000 us
are about as good it's probably winning
the lotto to be honest looking online
the cheapest partner cards as I've seen
cost eleven hundred and fifty dollars us
while most are priced closer to the
$1200 us asking price of the founders
Edition so this means you're looking at
around a 70% price hike over the GTX
tonight eti for what is almost certainly
going to be less than a 20% performance
boost so yeah that's just brutal to be
honest this is the problem with
pre-orders and videos taking them an
entire month ahead of time so your
average consumer is basically buying
blind and I doubt many of them media
will caution
about that it's pretty much hypetrain
full steam ahead and videos offered
buyers very little information in
regards to performance so it's a big
risk at these prices again We strongly
recommend your wait for our day 1
coverage so I predict that the RT X 2080
Ti is going to only be slightly faster
than the GTX 1080i while costing a
bloody truckload more and shockingly the
situation with the 2080 is even worse
right now the GeForce GTX 1080 models
are readily available for about $450 us
the RT X 2080 that carries an MSRP of
$700 us so that makes it a little over
50% more expensive even worse right now
most of the partner cards are listed for
$800 us making it almost 80% more
expensive and again we always expect
that upon release the prices are going
to be a bit inflated but even if we work
off the MSRP s prices really aren't
going to go below those anytime soon
until we get right to the end of the
product cycle or even after it so it's
not looking good especially when you
consider that in terms of performance
we're looking at maybe or maybe I should
say rather at most a 15% boost in
performance and really it's probably
likely to be less than that maybe 10%
again I'm just guessing here but these
figures make sense to me so in titles
where rate racing isn't being used
heavily or I suppose at all are you
looking at a 10% performance uplift for
almost an 80% hike in price and again I
don't know I'm just guessing here but I
don't think there's gonna be many titles
that make good use of rate racing to
justify that price premium you're
probably just better off with a GTX 1080
and even worse I seriously doubt that
the RT X 2080 can live with the GTX
1080i it's almost certainly going to be
slow up while costing more so again I'd
probably just buy a GTX 1080i at this
point but of course wait for the reviews
though it might be a bit risky cuz stock
may have run out by then I know it's a
bit we have a tough position for buyers
here moving on to the RT X 2070 we're
looking at gtx 1070 TI light performance
for at least $500 us but given what
we've seen with the 2080 models you can
expect
pay more like $600 u.s. at least for the
first few months so that's a $150 u.s.
price hike over the performance that
we've had for about a year now of course
we are in this position because Amy's
failed to compete with their rx Vegas
series Vega 56 and Vega 64 were great
for mining but pretty hopeless for
gaming Vega 64 in particular at this
point and video really are just
competing with themselves and frankly
they don't even appear to be doing a
great job of that with the GeForce 20
series I'd probably just snap up a gtx
1080 TI right now if i was in the market
for a high-end graphics card and that's
not something i think I've really ever
said before when we have a new
generation that's just been announced of
course once the pascal supply runs out
it's pretty much all over an nvidia can
just charge whatever they like because
let's be honest gamers will pay up i
don't mean to sound overly negative i
know we'll have upset a few nvidia fans
or probably quite a lot of nvidia fans
with sort of the negative tone of this
video how impress unimpressed rather
I've been with the specs and pricing but
yeah I honestly I'm just unimpressed
with the pricing given what I imagine
the performance will look like I don't
see how I could be wrong about this but
I will be very very happy if I am proven
wrong when it is time to start testing
these new GPUs of course this is an hour
of you so this is just speculation maybe
an educated guess you could say but it
doesn't really mean a whole lot until we
get some hard data and that will come in
a month's time when we first check out
the GeForce 20 series cards and of
course we'll go into a lot of depth
there and find out just how much bang
for your buck they do offer hopefully
it's a lot more than I'm predicting here
if so then it will be happy days in any
case just don't pre-order it's not a
smart idea for now ray-tracing looks to
be more hype than anything and Nvidia
are using this to hide the fact that
they don't actually have anything new to
sell at least just yet anyway the real
performance gains will come when they
move to the 700 meter process next year
so I don't see the GeForce 20 series
having a particularly long lifespan are
certainly nothing like what we saw with
Pascal
nvidia simply isn't going to accept
giving up the performance crown AMD and
i expect that is exactly what they will
be doing with the GeForce 20 series next
year that is of course if they don't act
and push out seven animated GPUs as soon
as possible so the GeForce 20 series
looks to be a bit of a money grab in my
opinion a stopgap to seven nanometers if
you will I think the plan is to cash in
it now on the RT X hype and then deliver
the real goods next year after all the
RT X name change is designed to make you
think that your Pascal GTX 1080i GTX
1080 and GTX 1070 are now heavily
outdated so give gamers the opinion
they've got to dump that GTX dinosaur
and getting on the RT X action and I
think this is why in videos pushing the
RT X xx atti out the gate right away
rather than waiting a year like they did
with the GT X 1080 Ti and they simply
aren't in a position where they can
juice the series over a two-year period
in fact in my opinion they don't even
have an entire year so rather than milk
it over a 24 month period and the plan
is to ravish gamers wallets from day one
on a more positive note the board
partner models look very nice in
particular I really like the MSI ah
range which comprises of five different
models so they've really gone all-in on
this one at the Ventus I think that's
how you say it is a very Fe like looking
card with the dual fan configuration but
I think it looks much better than it
really is Fe model so maybe they should
have got MSI to handle that one for them
these stealthy Juke series gets an RGB
light bar which looks quite good at
least it's RGB and the gaming tray looks
bigger and badder than ever and I of
course mean badder in a good way I will
be twisting the arm of my msi contact to
get that model for testing so fingers
crossed I can pull that one off
without pulling his arm off but as
always let me know which versions you'd
like us to check out and we will do our
best to make that happen anyway as I
said this isn't a review just Steve's
two cents so take that for what it is an
opinion without any hard performance
data and I think that's a pretty good
