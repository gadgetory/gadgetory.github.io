part 2 of our May Q&amp;amp;A if you missed the
first part definitely go back and check
that one out but this is part 2 and
let's get into the second half of the
questions that you guys asked us all
right next question is from nogira
sorry if I got that wrong Tim made me do
this one oh ok can you explain in more
detail what XMP is I suppose
well XMP stands for extreme memory
profile and that is extreme with an e
not an X anyway it was developed by
Intel back in the ddr3 days to help use
this fine tune their memory with just a
one-click button type solution because
otherwise you have to go through we have
to first set the frequency and then the
time and it's a bit confusing because
people don't know what timings work at
what frequency and so basically it's a
way for Intel and the memory makers to
take all that guesswork out for you guys
so rather than have to follow certain
timings at certain frequencies you just
load the XMP profile hits maximum
timings at the designated frequency but
without XMP so I suppose in the dark
days of ddr2 when we didn't have XMP
profiles by default the memory would
just boot up at a really safe profile so
a sort of a default specified profile
with very relaxed timings at a lower
frequency and that was just to ensure
compatibility so that the system would
actually boot up but if you've bought
premium memory designed to work above
spec which I suppose most of you guys do
spending half an hour in the BIOS making
sure that all the settings are correct
really is an ideal so XMP was created to
significantly reduce the time and
experience required to maximize your
memory performance all right next
question is from Apollo could you say
why my laptop gtx 1050 4 gigabyte
thermal throttles at 60 degrees does
this affect performance if so what could
I do to fix it
yeah so your laptop probably shouldn't
be thermal throttling at 60 degrees
seems very discrete laptop GPUs should
work fine all the way up into the mid
80s that's very typical for a sort of
gaming laptop or any discrete that's
cool for a lap
yeah I mean laptop CPUs write like a
hundred degrees so yeah I guess the way
that GPU boost works is that you know
the more temperature Headroom you have
the more likely it is to boost into
those sort of high frequency ranges so
you might be seeing less performance
there but sixty degrees is still pretty
cool there yeah I think though if you
are getting thermal throttling
legitimately and you're worried about
performance you can always open up the
laptop if you can and apply better
thermal paste to the GPU even the other
metal because laptop manufacturers
really do skimp a little bit on their on
their cooling paste
well yeah be interesting know what model
laptop it is so yeah okay now if there
is actually some sort of extreme limit
there because yeah as you say sixty
degrees is very cool so yeah knowing the
model could help and also have you tried
installing something like MSI
Afterburner with River tuner to actually
monitor not just the temperature world
game but also the frequency to know if
it is yeah make know what's working for
ya so interesting to see how your you
are monitoring if it is throttling or
not you seem confident that it is but to
be interesting that frequency it's
actually running at under those
conditions next question is from I'm
crazy pvp cool I have a rise in 514
hundred and was thinking of getting a
new Verizon 2600 X I also have an Isuzu
prime B 350 plus motherboard so should I
upgrade or wait for Zen to okay yeah
give us your thoughts to tell us how
anything I think the reason v 1400 still
pretty capable if you're not using
something like GT X 1080 Ti you're
probably still getting the most out of
your graphics card with that CPU that's
fair to say the 2600 X yeah it's a great
CPU but for gaming you probably won't
notice much of a difference so I guess
you probably want to wait for a more
substantial upgrade but then again I
guess if you're using productivity
workloads you might get a bit more out
of there 2600 I was just about to say it
really comes down to what you want to do
if the system says the 1400 perfectly
good gaming CPU is still especially if
you're only using a me range graphics
card as Tim said so yeah if you want a
boost in productivity then you will see
quite a nice boost with the 2600 X but
then you also want to make sure you have
good memory to take advantage of it so
yeah yeah
depends on what memory you have now I
suppose next question is from Abdullah
so
if I mispronounce that Israel ever going
to go down in price yeah one day it
certainly is I let's just do a
prediction here I predict the first
quarter of 2019 there you go
all right I predict never I reckon we'll
stay flat roughly flat and then the next
generation of products will come out and
maybe from there we'll see some jobs but
I think we were seeing rises for a long
time and now it sort of flattened out
and I think manufacturers don't really
like to make things cheaper so I'm
holding out on it to stain soon and I
also predict that the comment section
now hates Tim these questions from
Emeralds do ask manufacturers for
reviewing samples or do manufacturers
ask you to review them that's a great
question
yeah sometimes we request a product
particularly but something that you guys
are asking us to check out either ahead
of time or if it's released some things
we don't really review much like cases
keyboards and mice um I do there my
unboxing boxes but generally we pretty
well flooded with offers to check out a
new hardware on a daily basis so
sometimes we're like yeah and probably
don't have time to get to that but
obviously if it's CPU GPU related or a
new laptop or something like that we'll
jump on that so yeah it's nice to get
our hands on that stuff as it comes out
yeah and I think with some companies
especially the CPUs and GPUs sort of
thing this is an understanding between
us and the companies that both of us
want each other doing well yeah that's
work together on those products so it's
really really easy for those sort of
products to be reviewed by us no
problems there yeah so what Tim is
basically saying is when in a video
release a new graphics card we just sit
tight wait and I'll send out an email
and say all right we're releasing the
new GPU in two weeks time and here's the
NDA sign that and we'll send one out
yeah sounds good to us all right this
next question is from M just just M for
now which side will have the first X 499
a red or blue boy well I'm gonna have to
assume an AMD because you know 2nd gen
thread Ripper we've already seen that
that's sort of out there so it can't be
too far away but as I said early
these chipset names that it's getting
absolutely stupid I have no idea where
Intel's high-end f-stop platforms going
from here but yeah if they change to
something else and then AMD copies that
it's probably grounds for being sued
they're here
that's Rachel it's just getting
ridiculous for the owed the buyers okay
that's terrible anyway I think IMD will
win that one and then I don't know where
Intel goes from there
all right this questions from Mustafa
will we see an AP from AMD that is more
powerful than the Rison 520 400 G or
wait until they build it on second gen
plus a bit of a good GPU inside okay
yeah I've had a few people ask me we
were trying to think about it and I
doubt it at this point
the issue isn't so much can they put a
more powerful GPU inside an APU because
they 100% can the issue is that doing it
won't really yield any extra performance
as even the 2400 G is memory bandwidth
limited and we see that when comparing
it to the 22 energy when both of them
are overclocked so until they can
increase the memory bandwidth and we
spoke about ddr5 earlier it's unlikely
that we'll see any beefier ap use yeah
and right now the dye that they use for
those ApS has is fully unlocked in terms
of its GPU and CPU so yeah there has to
be a whole new silly yes they could do
the bump up clock speeds which seems
unlikely or that I have to make a new
chip and that's probably not gonna
happen at this point
no I this question is from need a better
name is there an actual noticeable
difference from 60 Hertz to 144 plus all
TV and movies are filmed at less than 40
fps even YouTube caps at 30 yeah so
YouTube you can actually get 60 FPS from
YouTube this really all be 60 FPS and
yeah most TV and movies are is like 24
for 30 fps but there is a big difference
between 60 and 144 Hertz like 60 FPS is
pretty smooth as it is but the the jump
in fluidity to 144 Hertz not just for
gaming but also just you know browsing
around windows day or night yeah yeah it
really is Dan right and it's only until
you use one of those mornings that you
really understand that sort of
difference in in smoothness so yeah it's
a really big difference you don't really
notice as much with films because we're
all used to
King films at 24 fps yeah yep you right
and even YouTube videos and all that you
don't really notice it but when you're
gaming and you're like making movements
and Saul you know reacting to what
you're doing that's obviously the good
one yeah yeah and as you say it's like
it enhances the windows experience like
get a chrome window and like scroll down
on a 60 Hertz panel and you think oh
that's not too bad then you're a 144
hurt so that's like scream so much
smoother okay so this question is from
psy ish got that right how much time an
effort does it go into making a mega
benchmark video Steve quite a bit
yeah so it's a sound arrogant or
anything like that but it is just it
really is way too much time and effort
so I don't imagine that you'll see too
many other content creators making those
types of videos you've really got to
just be sick in the head and love doing
it I spent about fifty hours
benchmarking for that last 36 game
head-to-head and then about another 16
hour a day creating the graphs the beer
roll and all the editing that goes into
making those sort of videos so it is a
massive undertaking I really do enjoy
making them though and I love seeing how
the hardware compares in a wide range of
games all right other question from Sai
ish
can i overclock a rise in its 2600 to
4.2 gigahertz using a stock cooler no no
I'd say not unless you live in a freezer
that won't be possible I think from
memory based on the day one review I did
test that I think was 4 gigahertz it's
pretty much the limit with the stock
cooler and even then things do get a bit
toasty I there are some good coolers
anyway for $20 u.s. or less I like the
gamax 202 I really like that one that
often sells for like 10 or 11 dollars
u.s. on Amazon so go check that out
all right this question is from James
have you tried overclocking the GN mod
mat yet I heard rumors about him bidding
press samples for top performance our
Steve wouldn't do that really not Steve
now he's too genuine of that but for
those of you who don't know what the mod
mat is here it is block me right out
there you go how good does that look
much better picture now
be careful of my mind Matt don't crease
it all right so yeah Steven he's
underhanded tactics with the media so
this is something I have wanted to touch
on yeah I have found quite amazing
performance with the mod Matt at about
1.45 volts I'm speaking along here Steve
though and he got a bit upset about that
he said me that that he said that much
voltage will start to degrade the Matt
so he suggested winding it down but I
think he's a bit concerned that you know
the other non cherry-picked Matt's
probably won't get to those voltages and
if I started reporting that then you
yeah people will know that you've been
cherry-picking the mod Matt's enough
silliness I don't really care about
overclocking the mod Matt that's not why
I have them on Matt I want my RGB light
add-ons and so release them Steve I want
one at the top and one at the bottom
yeah okay this question is from Kenya
he's oh jeez give that one another shot
this next question is from Kenny second
time lucky doing the reading this
question he's rising really future-proof
in gaming should we trust 720p results
as an indicator of it risin 1600 / 2600
vs. I 580 400 okay well if it's really
impossible to say right now because we
we don't know what the futures gonna
hold depends on games and many other
things like that but it should do very
well and 100% load because we've seen
that it does in other workloads and the
FX series they don't really do that well
under a hundred percent load for various
reasons mostly down to how it's designed
as for 720p well I do like those results
and basically what they do is they tell
us exactly how these CPUs perform in
games right now we're not GPU limited so
that's really important if you're just
testing the games we have today under
GPU limited conditions that it doesn't
really tell you how the CPU might behave
if there's sections of the game that do
become really heavy on the CPU where
you'll see slowdown so the 720p results
are good for that and also if you happen
to upgrade your GPU so a lot of people
say oh you know you test with the 1080
Ti and I don't use that but you might
buy a 1080 or maybe even a 1080i in a
year's time or two years times
secondhand or
you might keep your CPU for the next
three years and then buy a GPU and three
years time that's way more powerful than
a today UTI and then it would be really
interesting know how your CPU you have
stacked up at 720p when it wasn't GPU
limited so by you just want to mask the
performance and say oh look they all
they're much the same there's some 4k
results it's just some it's not in fear
but even doesn't tell you anything so
okay last question here probably going
to be a quick one it's from Specter does
B 360
motherboard support three fair or it's
actually 3,200 memory it's not three
thousand ten megahertz that's fine all
that slide do the B 360 motherboards
support 3,200 memory that is the
question and well the answer's no well
yeah they are yeah well they do support
the sticks but not at 3200 speeds
I think that's yeah so you'll be limited
to 20 666 or 2400 yes that's right so it
depends on the CPU so the core i5s and
i7s work at 2666 that's what you'll be
locked up and I think the core are
threes and lower 2400 so you can install
any memory above that spec the
disadvantage there will be when you load
the XMP profile it will be loading
timings for that higher frequency so you
will want to possibly look at a guide to
tighten up most time it does really
affect Intel CPUs too much but there
will be a little bit of extra
performance to be had there by
tightening those timings up and that's
it for this month's Q&amp;amp;A video thanks to
everyone who submitted asked questions
throughout all our various channels we
really appreciate it definitely go back
and check out part 1 of this video if
you haven't already and I guess Steve
though we'll catch it next month for
another Q&amp;amp;A definitely we'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
