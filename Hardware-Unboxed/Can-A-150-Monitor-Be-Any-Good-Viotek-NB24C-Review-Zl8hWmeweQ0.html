published a lot of monitor reviews on
the channel over the last couple of
weeks companies just keep wanting to
send them to us lately I guess that's
pretty nice but this should be the last
one for at least a few weeks is very
soon we'll be getting right into some
Nvidia RTX coverage but the monitor I'm
looking at today the vo-tech NB 24c is
one of the more interesting ones this is
a super budget focused display cost just
a hundred and fifty US dollars and comes
with a 24 inch 1080p code VA panel with
a maximum refresh rate of 75 Hertz now
you can get cheaper 24 inch 1080p 75
Hertz monitors but almost all of them
use fairly mediocre TN panels the NB 24
C gives you a display quality boost
through the use of a VA panel but
doesn't cost that much more than TN
equivalents in fact it's one of the
cheapest non TN displays of these specs
which makes it a pretty attractive
product for budget shoppers the design
of this monitor is very similar to the
GN 2040 biotech accidentally sent me a
couple of weeks back biotech says these
75 Hertz displays more offers focus than
the 144 Hertz gamer grade G and 24 C but
the design is just as nice with slim
bezels on the front and a simple elegant
rear constructed from a single piece of
matte black plastic there's nothing
crazy about the build but I reckon it
looks pretty good particularly as
vo-tech hasn't fallen into the trap of
using chunky blocky plastic with their
budget display the stand is different
with the NB 24 C it's a more traditional
flat wire shape constructed entirely out
of metal it's sturdy and looks great
though there's a bit of wobble at the
connection point on the rear of the
display section it's also a very basic
stand only offering tilt adjustment and
it's it's fairly low so you might need
to raise it yourself considering there's
no height adjust feature the NB 24 C is
a curved monitor with an 1800 hour curve
to be precise I don't think the curve
adds anything to the experience
whatsoever at 24 inches and I'd prefer
to be flat particularly as it's supposed
to be designed for office use
that said the curve is reasonably subtle
and I'm just puzzled as to why panel
manufacturer would even choose to create
a 24 inch curved display I would have
thought for budget products there would
have been more demand for a flat version
for inputs there
and HDMI and VGA input if you want to
use the built-in speakers you'll have to
utilize HDMI audio is there's no other
audio input and for controlling the
on-screen display we have a row of
simple buttons along the bottom edge of
the monitor so no directional toggle
which is a bit frustrating that said
there are barely any features or
settings in the OSD so there's not a lot
to navigate through you do get a low
bool out mode though and some cheek
crosses though I guess that is about it
the NB 24c is a free sync monitor
however the adaptive sync range is only
48 to 75 Hertz so the monitor does not
support low framerate compensation this
really limits the usefulness of free
sync and practices you'll have to keep
your framerate while gaming within that
narrow window to ensure the best
variable refresh experience dropping
below 48 FPS can result in a rather
jarring reduction to smoothness which
you wouldn't get from a monitor with AF
C and a larger refresh rate range just
something to keep in mind though in
terms of brightness there between 4c
isn't a very bright monitor sitting at
around 222 nits which is very close to
biotechs stated 220 net specification
when I say isn't very bright I do mean
in comparison to other monitors that are
typically more around the 300 nits mark
personally I reckon 200 nits or lower is
fine for most indoor users unless
there's you know a lot of glare or
reflections that sort of thing the
contrast ratio had actually exceeded my
expectations with the default ratio of
nearly 4,000 to one well above typical
3000 to one ratios for VA panels black
levels are really good from this monitor
but there is a very small amount of
backlight bleed around the edges present
when viewing dark images for response
times I noticed a bit of conflicting
information from vo-tech their spec
sheet notes 8 millisecond grader gray
response times while their product
listing claims 5 milliseconds northern
either is all that important because I
actually measured an average greater
gray response time of ten point nine
eight milliseconds which puts this panel
firmly in entry-level VA territory VA is
the slowest type of LCD technology
though some of the higher performance
gaming displays can put up decent times
with overdrive
however the NB 24 C uses a more budget
oriented display and there is no
overdrive functionality so what we're
left with is the default panel
performance which is unsurprisingly
fairly slow and unimpressive
that said it's around the mark of the
ace of nitro VG 240 y another 24 inch
1080p 75 Hertz monitor these is a flat
IPS panel instead input lags
unimpressive as well though again it's
well within what I've expect for an
entry-level display if you want the
absolute fastest response you'll need to
upgrade to a higher-end display even a
budget 1080p 144 Hertz display should
suffice
for most users and more casual gamers
this input lag performance won't affect
your experience all that much time to
look at color performance and here again
we're getting an entry-level experience
in other words very little has been done
to ensure this panel is calibrated at
the factory judging by the wild CCT
curve and strange gamer performance I'd
suggest biotech took the panel straight
off the shelf and integrated it without
any additional work which I guess isn't
all that surprising for a hundred and
fifty dollar product delta-e averages
range from four point six one in
grayscale to three point one four in
saturation and three point six four in
color checker with maximum Delta is in
the 7.0 range
luckily overall srgb coverage still
exceeds biotechs rated 92% at more like
97% so there is some quality to this
panel that should be correctable with
calibration unfortunately biotechs
on-screen controls are very limited
you can adjust brightness and contrast
along with user color but that's you
crucially there's no gamma adjustment
feature so it's impossible to fix the
gamma curve and with only basic color
controls it's hard to fix this CCT curve
you can see the red green and blue lines
don't run parallel the blue and green
lines cross so basic color controls are
unable to fix this sort of behavior I
was able to adjust either the low gray
range or the high Gro range to a decent
level of accuracy but that's just
throughout the other range and nothing
really improved performance so
unfortunately there's none of what you
can do in terms of setting tweaks to
improve the color accuracy of the NBD
24c that said it is possible to achieve
decent performance through a full
calibration when you're coming from so
far back it's hard to get elite level
calibration normally the goal is to get
things within the ballpark with OSD
setting tweaks and then finish it off
with nice CC profile but here it's just
relying on the profile and as you can
see the CCT curve isn't fully accurate
and while the grayscale Delta II average
is lower than 1.0 there are still a
couple of loose values
it's a similar story with the saturation
and color checker results overall though
not bad considering where the NB 24
Series act you can thank L man 5 for
that
as always we do provide our calibration
profile for this monitor to our patreon
links to that in the description below
however the profile can only do so much
and due to panel variation it won't
provide these exact results for other
units ideally you'd want either great
factory performance or the ability to
make a few tweaks using the OSD but
understandably a budget display isn't
going to give you that calibration all
also has the effect of reducing
brightness and contrast in fact now the
monitor tops out at just 200 nits of
brightness and with a contrast ratio of
just 3480 to 1 the contrast ratio is
still decent for a rear panel but
brightness is hit even harder from an
already low base uniformity is also an
issue with the NB 24 C the panel is both
entry-level and curved so there's a
double whammy there in terms of getting
a uniform image most of the panel is ok
it's just the outer left side that
deviates significantly with very high
Delta ease of above the 7.0 so you will
have just seen a bunch of performance
metrics that aren't exactly amazing
relatively wick brightness slow response
times weak input lag and poor
calibration from the factory with poor
uniformity but let's not forget that we
are talking about an entry-level monitor
and it's ridiculous to expect
professional-grade calibration or
top-end response times from a display
that cost just a hundred and fifty
dollars the main thing to talk about is
whether the NB 24 C performs below what
you'd expect for a budget monitor and of
course all these metrics I don't really
think that's the case in terms of
factory color accuracy response times
and input lag certainly the NB 24 C
falls within a range that's typical for
an entry-level monitor in fact in many
of these areas it performs similarly to
the ASA nitro VG 240 Y a competitor with
an IPS panel the main question at this
point is whether you should buy
something like the vo-tech NB 24 C or a
cheaper TN panel of equivalent specs if
you really don't care about how the
monitor performs in terms of color
quality and just want a cheap 24 inch
1080p 75 Hertz display I'd go out and
buy the absolute cheapest tier monitor
of these specs which will set you back
around a hundred bucks these days
but if you care about color quality in
particular there are plenty of reasons
to spend one hundred and
few dollars on the NB 24c instead it has
a far better contrast ratio and far bit
of black levels than any budget T and
display and you get superior viewing
angles - even though factory calibration
isn't great you'll get a better picture
quality with this VA display compared to
those dirt cheap $100 T ends so if you
are after better picture quality from
your budget 24 inch 1080p 75 Hertz
display I'd recommend the vo-tech n B 24
C because it one hundred and fifty
dollars
it's one of the cheapest non t n
displays with those specs on the market
and it does deliver a meaningful quality
improvement in some areas this is kind
of where the ace of VG 240 why I
reviewed a few weeks back fell short it
wasn't better than the budget TN in
terms of picture quality despite being
an IPS display and it actually cost more
than this via tech at $180 at that price
you were better off spending 200 bucks
on a 144 Hertz TN but the vo-tech
doesn't have such issues it's cheaper
sitting almost perfectly between budget
tiens
and 144 hurt stearns while offering an
actual upgrade on those $100 displays
that's it for this via tech NB 24 c
