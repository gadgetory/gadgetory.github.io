video about high-end CPUs you know the
eight core ones that prior to March 2017
nobody could actually afford but now
kind of can yeah so previously is in
five months ago if you wanted an eight
core 16 thread CPU you'd pretty much
have to refinance your home the
temptation though was just so great that
many did of course they all wanted the
core i7 69 50 X but with interest rates
the way they are they had to settle for
the piddly little 69 hundred K so the
point I'm trying to make here is that
previously Intel's eight core CPUs were
stupidly overpriced but now we have the
core i7 78 20x and it's less stupidly
overpriced the reason you tell us
high-end desktop platform pricing has
smartened up a little bit is of course
due to risin 7 the eight core 16 thread
r7 1700 particular was introduced back
in march at an unbelievable MSRP of $330
us and if that wasn't hard enough to
believe it can be purchased online for
his little as $290 us today intel's
response to Rison was the core x range
and that includes the core i7 78 20x
though I'm not quite sure anyone at
Intel actually understands how pricing
works I mean they obviously get that
money is good and that they want more of
it
so I guess that explains why their new 8
core model comes in at $600 us I guess
in their defense they probably think at
that price they're basically giving them
away okay guys so that's probably the
most sarcastic intro of ever done it's
at least top 5 material but it's really
hard to take this comparison seriously
when one CPU has an MSRP of $600 and
it's currently retailing for 680 dollars
while the other has an MSRP of 330
dollars and is currently selling for
$290 and on paper they are quite similar
the cheaper CPU can also be paired
happily with a $100 motherboard while
the more expensive
CPU requires a two hundred and $20 plus
motherboard so it's pretty clear AMD's
Rison seven seventeen hundred is
significantly cheaper than Intel's Core
i7 78 20x and yet they both pack eight
cores with 16 threads what I want to
know is just how much better is Intel's
offering we've already done a lot of
Rison and core X testing here at harbor
unboxed so we have a pretty good idea of
how these CPUs compare that said I
wanted to run some additional tests and
initially this video was going to be one
of those for science type deals where
the information is kind of pointless for
average consumer but it looks into
something most other benchmarks don't
what I wanted to see was how the skylake
X based core i7 7820 X compared to the
broad well II 6,500 K clock for clock at
4 gigahertz using the same ddr4 2666
memory I then thought well you guys are
going to want to see Rison 7 in the mix
so I tested the 1700 at 4 gigahertz
using ddr4 2666 memory then I thought
the AMD fanboys won't like that too much
even if we are doing it in the name of
science I'll get things like Steve risin
scales better than Intel with high
frequency memory you're handicapping
rising to make Intel look good unsubbed
so then I thought in addition to testing
rising at 4 gigahertz using ddr4 2666
memory I would also retest using ddr4
3200 memory and then everyone would be
happy right no because now we're showing
Rison at its maximum overclock using
high frequency memory while the 78 20x
is limited to 4 gigahertz with 2666
memory so I retested the 78 20x at 4.5
gigahertz using ddr4 3,200 memory with
the mesh also overclocked to 3 gigahertz
by this point I was heavily
sleep-deprived but the testing was done
so I moved on to write a coherent and
to-the-point introduction you know no
more than say a minute
looking back I'll admit things got a bit
away from me here but the good news is
we do now have 19 graphs and 6 CPU
configurations to check out so the real
fun is just about to begin
rather than start with the productivity
benchmarks we're going to skip to the
dessert for this video we're starting
with the game benchmarks consider it
means
trying to make amends for that intro
first up let me explain a bit about
what's going on here with all these
foreign looking yellow bars the three
yellow bars at the bottom represent the
horizon 7 1700 core i7 6900 k and core
i7 78 20x all clocked at 4 gigahertz
using ddr4 2666 memory the two sets of
blue bars compare the r7 1700 and I 778
20x again at full you Hertz but this
time with ddr4 3,200 memory then the
golden bars at the top these are
showcase in the i7 78 20x in all of its
glory at 4.5 gigahertz using ddr4 3,200
memory with the mesh interconnect
overclocked to 3 gigahertz so you got a
lot good let's jump into it the results
that you've been staring at while I
explained my color coding is battlefield
1 and for the graphics card we have the
GeForce GTX 1080 Ti looking at the
apples to apples results those yellow
bars we see that the 1600 K is a few
percent faster than the new 78 20x in
this title
meanwhile the 78 20x is just 13 percent
faster than the rise in 7 1700 now
what's interesting you note here and we
did see these in our 30 game benchmark
comparison recently using the risin 5
1600 and core i7 7800 X is that once we
up the memory speed the r7 1700 is able
to roughly match the 78 20x in fact the
increased memory speed really does
nothing for the Intel CPU in this game
the 78 20x is now just 2 percent faster
when comparing the minimum frame rate
winding Intel's 8 core CPU right up
doesn't really help that much either at
4.5 gigahertz the 78 20x is now just 3%
faster than the humble r7 1700
civilization 6 is a game where rise and
has in the past looked quite poor in
relation to intel's quad core offerings
such as the 7700 k and even to this day
looks a little bit sluggish
however throw the core x-range into the
mix and verizon starts to look like a
bit of alright clock for clock with the
slower 2666 memory Verizon was 11%
faster than the 78 20x
those shockingly 14% slower than the 60
900k increasing the memory frequency to
3,200 boosted the 78 20x performance by
a whopping 17% though less whopping when
compared to the i7 1700 s almost 30%
performance
increase we're only seeing a 20% boost
in memory frequency here so the 2666 B
must have been imposing a serious
bottleneck for risin overclocking 278
20x to 4.5 gigahertz help to extract a
further 11 percent performance but even
so still trailed the r7 1700 by a 9%
margin in our 30 game benchmark
Civilization six provided the 7800 X
with one of its worst results against
the r5 1600 so let's move on to see how
things look in f1 2016 while things do
look much more competitive here looking
at the ddr4 2666 numbers we do yet again
file the 1600 K is actually fast in the
7820 x1 match clock for clock the 78 20x
was also just 6% fast in the r7 1700
when looking at the minimum frame rate
upping the memory frequency to 3200 once
again does little to nothing for the 78
20x the gains Verizon weren't huge here
either but it was enough to see the r7
1700 roughly match the new Intel 8 core
CPU that said squeezing a bit more from
the 78 20x did place it firmly ahead of
the r7 1700 by around a 6% margin moving
on with our Far Cry primal which might
seem like an odd choice given it's not
that well optimized for high coil count
CPUs but it often delivers interesting
results so I thought it was worth a look
here we see when using the ddr4 2666
memory that the 78 20x is 13% slower
than the 1600 K and that's obviously a
pretty significant margin it was still
8% fast in the r7 1700 though at least
when looking at the average frame rate
moving to ddr4 3200 we see that the
faster memory boost the minimum frame
rate of the 78 20x by 5 percent margin
while the r7 1700 enjoyed a 10% boost
the rise in CPU was now 8 percent faster
when comparing the minimum frame rate
and a few frames faster for the average
that said once we give the 7800 X all
she's got
it's able to boost the minimum frame
rate by a further 11% allowing it to
once again overtake the r7 1700 next up
we have hitman and this is yet another
game with the older core i7 600 case
slays both the Rison 7 1700 and core i7
78 20x when mass clock for clock the r7
1700 all
so makes out quite poorly with the ddr4
2666 memory as it was 10% slower than
the 78 20x and around 17% slower than
the 600 k when comparing the minimum
frame rate increase in the memory speed
to 3200 didn't do much for the 78 20x
and we've seen this quite a bit already
the r7 1700 on the other hand enjoyed a
13% jump in the minimum frame rate and a
15% increase for the average so it's not
far behind the 78 20x now that said
though turning up the heat further with
the core i7 78 20x at 4.5 gigahertz
helped to improve performance by a
further 8% and now the Intel CPU is
comfortably faster than the r7 1700
finally we have total war Warhammer and
this is a title that has been well
optimized to take advantage of Rison
through a few handy updates as you can
see even with ddr4 2666 memory the rise
in CPU is able to lay waste to not just
the 78 20x but also the 1600 K in this
title it's also worth noting that the
Broadwell ECP was again fast and then
Intel's new 78 20x delivering an 8%
greater minimum frame rate upgrading a
ddr4 3200 did improve the 7820 axis
minimum frame rate result by 10% which
is decent though the r7 1700 did see a
massive 16 percent performance bumpy in
fact even at 4.5 gigahertz with a 3
gigahertz measure overclock the 78 20x
was still slightly slower than the r7
1700 in this title moving on from the
gaming benchmarks I have a few synthetic
and application benchmarks to look at
before checking out memory performance
and then the power consumption Cinebench
r15 is good for measuring raw CPU
performance and here memory performance
has a little impact interestingly the
core i7 78 20x is fast in the 1600 K
when match clock for clock albeit just
4% faster when it comes to
multi-threaded performance the rise in
717 hundred and 78 20x are on par though
the Intel CPU does enjoy a 5% advantage
in the single threaded scenarios
overclocked to 4.5 gigahertz the 78 20x
naturally pulls ahead and can now be
seen achieving a score of just over
1,900 points next up we have some
compression and decompression
performance with 7-zip from what I've
gathered rise ins SMT feature helps
massively with decompression work but
isn't utilized for compression
I haven't looked into this properly yet
it's just a theory but in the case of
Verizon it is world's better at
decompression than it is compression
which for most uses is fine as most do
significantly more decompression work
anyway clock for clock the 1600 K and 78
20x are very similar in this test while
Verizon was noticeably faster for the
decompression test but significantly
slower for the compression test
interestingly like what we did see quite
a few times in the gaming benchmarks
increase in the memory speed did help
rise in quite a bit but had very little
impact on the 78 20x overclocked a 4.5
gigahertz the 78 20x took a good step
forwards and is now able to match the
decompression performance of Verizon the
blender render test is measured in
seconds so lower is better here memory
frequency also has little to no impact
on performance so this didn't help rise
and close the gap on the Intel CPUs when
using the ddr4 3,200 memory horizon was
8% slow in the 78 20x in this test when
compared clock for clock and 23% slower
once the 78 20 X was overclocked to the
max and it's four point five gigahertz
frequency so a pretty solid win for
Intel here we find a similar story when
testing with Corona the 78 20x is a
little bit faster than the 1,600 K and a
lot faster than the r7 1700 with both
CPU is overclocked to the max the 78 20x
was 16% faster of course it does cost
more than twice as much so technically
not a win in terms of price versus
performance before we get to the power
consumption figures here's a quick look
at the Ida 64 cache and memory benchmark
results there are a few graphs to get
through but we'll blow through on pretty
quickly here we see that rise ins dual
channel memory controller is quite
limiting in terms of bandwidth compared
to the broad welly and Scala hex CPUs
which use a quad channel memory
controller whereas the 78 20x can push
66 gigabytes per second for the read
through put the r7 1700 was limited to
just 40 gigabytes per second meanwhile
once overclocked the 78 20x hums along
to the tune of 81 gigabytes per second
which is obviously quite mega what's
interesting to note though is that the
core i7 1600 K is significantly better
than both the r7 770 100x when it comes
to memory latency Rosen does improve
with higher clocked memory
as does the 78 20x but I guess that's to
be expected
Rison is well down when looking at the
level 1 cache throughput it's basically
half that of the Intel CPUs that said
though well down ballot the latency
performance is much the same rise ins
level 2 cache performance is excellent
smashing the 600 K clock for clock and
even beating the 78 20x overclock the 78
20x does pull ahead but even so Verizon
is still very strong here although
throughput overall was weaker the 1600
Ches level 2 cache offers a very low
latency Rison is also quite good heat
while the delay for the 78 20x is quite
extreme that is until we overclock the
CPU when compared to the 60 900k the r7
1700 s level 3 cache throughput looks
excellent
however when compared to the 78 20x it
does look quite weak indeed
however throughput isn't everything and
here we see that despite the big ballot
the latency is still very poor for the
78 20x even once overclocked so in terms
of responsiveness Verizon has a big
advantage here since memory frequency
has little to no impact on the overall
system consumption I've only looked at
the ddr4 2666 figures here along with
the 4.5 gigahertz overclock for the 78
20x clock for clock the core i7 600 K
was very efficient pushing total system
consumption are just 206 watts in
Cinebench r15 multi-threaded The Horizon
7 1700 didn't do quite well drawing just
248 watts
while the 78 20x was quite a bit
hungrier heading 268 watts however it
was once overclocked the 78 20x
increased total system consumption by
26% and is now seen consuming 36% more
power than the r7 1700 a pretty
significant figure indeed well then
there's some very interesting things to
discuss here let's start with the core
i7 1600 K and 78 20x comparison was
quite shocking to find that were
compared clock for clock using the same
speed memory that the oldest 600 K was
faster in every single game we tested at
times was significantly fast a lot what
we saw with Civilization 6 even giving
the 78 20x an advantage of the faster
ddr4 3,200 memory which mr.
okay doesn't actually support it was
rare that the sky like axe CPU would hit
the lead even overclocked to 4.5
gigahertz with the three gigahertz mesh
frequency overclock this 78 20x was only
able to match the 600 K in most of the
titles tested and realistically we could
go ahead in the squeeze a few hundred
megahertz more out of the Broadway Lee
CPU adding insult to injury is the fact
that the 78 20 X consumes significantly
more power to deliver similar
performance of the previous generation
part for that 4.5 gigahertz overclock
you will require a seriously high-end
liquid-cooled solution if you want to
avoid heavy throttling when it came to
application performance the 78 20 X did
look much better though even then it
wasn't always clearly superior to the 16
hour okay
for example we saw similar performance
in the 7-zip application while the
Cinebench r15 numbers weren't
drastically different either the 78 20x
was marginally better in the blender and
corona tests but not to the degree where
you'd find yourself that excited about
the results the only advantage of the 78
20x really has over the six 900k is the
fact that it's cheaper around 35%
cheaper which is obviously a big deal
that said if you gave me the choice of
either of these CPUs at the same price
I'd probably take the 1600 K moving on
to the 78 20x versus r7 1700 comparison
it's pretty clear that in terms of value
the rise in seven CPU is in a different
league I really don't think even the
most loyal Intel fanboy could argue
otherwise
and as always I'm not sure why they'd
bother anyway once you factor in things
like the motherboard cost to the
equation the 78 20 X costs around a
hundred and thirty percent more than the
r7 1700 needless to say it was never
anywhere near that much faster
comparing the maximum overclocked gaming
performance results really was pretty
similar experience overall the 78 20x
for example it enjoyed a decent winning
hitman though the r7 1700 was noticeably
better in Civilization 6 and yeah as I
said the rest was really much of a
muchness the 78 20x was 23% faster in
blender and 16% faster for the corona
benchmark so it was hands-down faster
for these productivity workloads
but yeah keep in mind it wasn't 130
percent faster and for that extra
performance it did consume 36 percent
more power so also keep that in mind in
the end I feel like the sky like X
architecture is it best a side step from
Broadway Lee and this has a forwarded
risin a great deal of breathing room
hadn't L been the slightest bit
aggressive with their pricing then risin
would have a serious fight on its hands
but as it stands at 600 ish dollars
you'd be mad to spend that kind of money
on the 78th 20 X where you can get
comparable performance for less than
half that price and that's where I'm
gonna leave this comparison if you like
this video we'll go ahead and make it
official even share their video and of
course don't forget to subscribe as I do
have a heat more benchmark content
coming up on the channel very soon I'm
your host Steve see you again soon guys
