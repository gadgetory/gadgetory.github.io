we're talking be 350 motherboards or
more precisely what my top 5 be 350 list
it looks like since starting the top 5
series all the way back in June now now
with my top 5 GTX 1017 graphics card
picks many of you have been hounding me
to make an AMD B 350 motherboard version
and well it's been on my to-do list now
for many months finally things have
quieted down enough in December and with
Tim coming on board to carry some of the
workload that's freed up a bit of my
time so I thought I'll put this video
together as usual I'm not just picking 5
products and saying this one's the best
this one 2nd best third best and so on
we're a little more creative in that at
least we like to think we are anyway the
categories for this video include best
ultra cheap motherboard a best value ATX
model best mini ITX model best
overclocker and the most important
category best-looking you know that last
ones
bit of a fun bonus round anyway let's
get into it
front so first up my best entry-level be
350 motherboard and the award goes to
the asrock a B 350 M for $6 us it simply
can't be beat apart from the fact that
there really aren't any cheaper P 350
motherboards to pick from wins for the
simple fact that it beats everything
else priced between 60 and 70 dollars us
in fact the next best board would be the
pro 4 version which backs to extra DIMM
slots so slightly better for those
wanting to upgrade their memory in the
future
the asrock a B 350 M might only offer
two DIMM slots but you also get a real
three-phase v core vrm with a double ax
so there's a 3+3 design and you also get
MDOT to support the rest of the board is
pretty basic but there's really nothing
inherently bad about the design or the
feature set for the price you really are
getting a great motherboard for those of
you buying an AMD APU though you will
want the pro 4 versions that model does
provide display connectivity and you get
things like DVI VGA and HDMI for those
though not interested in using
integrated graphics the a/b 350 M offers
a healthy amount of USB port so you get
2 USB 2.0 ports and 6 USB 3.1 gem 1
ports if you are after USB type-c though
again you will have to go for the pro 4
model the onboard audio is decent and
you get a basic but tried-and-true real
tech Cubitt Ethernet controller although
value for money as rock a B 350 M is the
best choice for those that want to spend
as little as possible but still want a
board that can safely overclock the
Rison v 1600 or any of the other rise
and CPUs for example
the first board I ever tested the risin
5 series of CPUs on was the sous prime B
350 plus and I have to say it's one of
the best be 350 motherboards that I've
used to date there are more expensive
and arguably better standard ATX boards
available but for those looking to spend
as little as possible while still
receiving a great motherboard the prime
be 350 plus pax a lot at the 110 dollar
price point I have to admit I was
tossing up between the Isuzu Prime at be
350 plus in gigabytes a be 350 gaming 3
I have both of the boards and I very
much like both of them and frankly
picking between the two is very
difficult user reviews though they do
seem to lean towards the gigabyte board
but in their current form with the
latest bias I personally prefer the
Isuzu model so that's what I'm gonna go
with it's a great overclocker and I've
managed to extract the most out of all
my rising CPUs with it like the asrock a
B 350 M that we looked at just a moment
ago I feel like the Isuzu Prime be 350
plus is a leader at its price point this
coupled with the excellent overclocking
is the key reason for why I have picked
it compared to similar price boards the
vrm of the prime is also much better as
you get for real phases
I have to admit there really isn't a
huge amount of competition for the best
be 350 mini ITX motherboard I believe
there are only about 4 boards on our
firm right now so yeah not a lot of
competition but there are two standout
models in my opinion that is the
gigabyte a be 350 n Gaming Wi-Fi and the
asrock a be 350 gaming ITX AAC and both
cost the same amount at around 115
dollars a soos does offer a nice-looking
ROG Strix be 350 i mini ITX port but
it's pretty hard to come by at the
moment and it does seem a very pricey
for me as rock wins this battle and
therefore my money would go towards an
a/b 350 gaming ITX AC although I'm not a
hundred percent sure which bought
ultimately offers the best vrm design
they are both adequate when paired with
a risin 7 cpu so that's really the main
thing that said though the vrm on the
gigabyte board does seem to run quite a
bit hotter than that of the asrock board
other reasons why i prefer as rocks
board include this superior UEFI
experience the Intel Gigabit LAN
higher-quality implementation of the
realtek ALC 1220 codec USB type-c
support and it does have three fan
headers not just two that last one is a
bit of a small detail but I do love my
fairness
now if you're after an affordable be 350
motherboard that can land those big
overclocks so 4 gigahertz up with the
horizon 7 1700 for example then I feel
like the msi be 350 crate gaming is the
board you're after despite the very
reasonable 110 dollar asking price that
packs the same for +4 vrm design of the
more expensive and higher-end X 370
boards such as the 160 dollar MSI X 370
gaming Pro carbon for example for a be
350 motherboard at this price the vrm is
exceptional the board also packs some
decent features though overall I would
have to say it's not as nice as that
little Azeroth board that we just looked
at are the audio and networking
solutions for example they're inferior
in fact I would say in terms of those
kind of features it's quite similar to
the Isuzu Prime be 350 plus I should
just quickly note though that if you
still want these strong overclocking
capabilities of the crate motherboard
but you are after better audio and
networking than the slightly more
expensive MSI be 350 gaming pro carbon
that might be the way to go it cost just
$10 more and it packs the same 4+4 vrm
but it does offer a better Realtek audio
codec and you do get intel gigabit
networking the gaming pro is also a more
sedate looking motherboard but I think
the crates kind of cool and I enjoy the
aggressive looking design the big issue
though with these MSI motherboards for
my fellow aziz is the fact that they're
not sold in Australia so that's
disappointing and I'd say my fallback
then would be the Asuza Prime at be 350
plus
I actually happen to think the MSI be
350 crate gaming it does look great and
I'm a bit sore that we can't purchase
one locally you can order it via Newegg
but once you factor in shipping it's
really not a great deal at all forty
dollars shipping yeah I don't really
want one that badly thankfully though if
you are after a unique looking board
there are quite a few alternatives and
my new favorite is one that I recently
used in a building that's MSI's be 350 M
mortar Arctic the board might only pack
a four-phase vrm but even so you won't
have any trouble when it comes to
overclocking I paired mine with a
Verizon seven 1700 X overclocked to four
gigahertz by only changing about two
settings that was very stable and ran
out reasonable temperatures so you'll
get on fire with a six core eyes and
five processor which seems like probably
a more realistic pairing with a be 350
board of this caliber and if you do get
a capable chip then running at 24/7 at 4
gigahertz won't be an issue I do get
that looks ant or at least shouldn't be
of great importance but I also get why
those who are passionate about their PC
enjoy the bling the great thing there
about the mortar Arctic is that it costs
just ninety five dollars u.s. or 135
dollars Aussie and for that you get a
reasonably well equipped motherboard so
it's not all just for show well there
you have it my top 5 be 350 motherboard
picks before wrapping things up I would
like to just note a few things almost
all be 350 motherboards are designed and
capable of safely powering an
eight-course 16 thread rise and 7 CPU
such as the 1800 X for example in fact
the only board I know of that isn't able
to do just what I said is the asrock a B
350 M - h DV yeah that's if it's the HD
v that board
I think asrock only list compatibility
was 65 watt rise in CPUs so that means
that you could technically use the Rison
7 1700 not the 1700 X or the 18 hundreds
but you could use the plain-jane 1700
but you certainly shouldn't overclock on
that particular motherboard I have to
say it's an interesting choice asrock
made with the a/b 350 M
HDV as the planer sounding a B 350 M is
much cheaper and that's the board we
looked at first as my best value
entry-level board so my advice is if you
want a cheap a m4 motherboard that
offers display connectivity that can't
overclock just get an a320 board for
like $50 also it's worth noting that
when buying a premium be 350 motherboard
you don't spend too much because good
quality X 370 boards they start fir and
$130 us so typically you are looking at
spending say 20 to $30 us more on a X
370 board of comparable quality to
better than be 350 version and for those
of you unaware the X 370 chipset
provides for extra USB 3.1 gen2 on ports
and two extra SATA 6 gigabits per second
ports thanks to the inclusion of two
extra pcie 2.0 lanes
it also supports multiple GPUs using a
dual 8 x configuration it has to be said
though for most uses the X 370 boards
offer a little over the B 350 s which is
why the cheaper be 350 motherboards are
so popular and I think that about covers
everything so I'm gonna leave it at that
