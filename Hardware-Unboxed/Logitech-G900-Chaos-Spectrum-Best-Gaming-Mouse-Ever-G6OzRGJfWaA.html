gaming peripherals company like Logitech
come out with a new flagship device and
I've been salivating at the prospect of
getting my hands on their brand new G
900 chaos spectrum finally the day is
here and I'm very excited to see how
this new wild gaming mouse performs and
what Logitech have managed to pack into
this extremely cool looking device now
let's get one thing out of the way first
to call this Mouse Wireless is correct
but it can also be used in the wired
capacity uniquely ended in fabric
braided micro USB charging cable
connects to the front of the mouth just
like a wired mouse would and the Maslin
operates in a Wired mode whilst charging
up the G 900s battery it's very cool to
have the option but Logitech done their
utmost to make the wireless modes so
good they would never want to touch an
attached device again perhaps the key to
this goal was the utilization of the pmw
3366 sensor today recognizes the very
best sense are available and built from
the ground up with wireless performance
in mind in partnership with its supplier
2.4 gigahertz USB adapter logitech
claims a report rate of just one
millisecond yes you heard me correctly
one millisecond report raid on a
wireless mouse finally we can gain
wirelessly and sleep at night knowing
that all of our deaths were in fact due
to lack of skill and the highway was not
to blame wait maybe this is a bad thing
anyway the design of the mouse is
immediately recognizable is a Logitech
one and to me this kind of looks like
the aventador of the range especially up
front cleverly the mouse is ambidextrous
with magnetic button covers and
replaceable thumb buttons that can be
interchanged between either side of the
mouse this is great news for lefties
they often miss out when it comes to
really high-end gaming mice in terms of
overall size the G 900 is certainly not
large there's quite a narrow profile
narrower than that of the g502 but it
doesn't feel too much smaller to use my
hands aren't overly large though and
those that do have big hands may find it
to be a little on the slim side in terms
of length and height the G 900 and g502
are extremely similar those that have
been fans of the field the latter or G
402 for example would be
Miller territory to me the most
impressive part of the G 900 design is
this extremely lightweight especially
for a wireless mouse it comes in at 107
grams employing clever weight reduction
techniques all-around high quality
lightweight plastics have been used as
well as clever implementations such as a
hollow spoke scroll wheel design a chunk
of this tiny 107 grams is obviously this
wireless mouse is battery it takes
around 2 hours to charge the 720
milliamp hour battery that Logitech
claims will last 24 hours of actual use
with the LED lights on and 32 hours with
the light switched off conveniently the
G 900 can be used as a wired mouse as I
mentioned while it charges with its
nicely braided micro USB cable the
connector on the cable is kind of unique
and cool but also unfortunately specific
to the device I personally always have a
micro USB cable on the dash ready to go
as most devices use one but
unfortunately I wouldn't be able to use
this one for anything else due to its
prong designs buttons wise the G 900 is
equipped with 11 inputs which are
controlled by a 32 bit AR M processor
and configurations are stored on its
onboard memory honestly all the buttons
on the care spectrum feel great they all
deliver a really clean snappy click
that's satisfying low resistance and
extremely fast the mouse wouldn't be a
high-end Logitech without some sort of
fancy action in the scroll wheel the G
900 employees an updated version of
their dual mode hyper fast scrolling
again allowing you to toggle between a
precise click stepping and a much faster
free spinning mode on the fly dpi
switching is configured by standard to
allowing game is to jump anywhere
between 200 dpi to a staggering 12,000
dpi with the click of a button the G 900
is of course managed by Logitech proven
gaming software here you can configure
up to 5 profiles to be saved to the
mouse's onboard memory and program each
of the 11 inputs to any function you
desire Logitech software also allows
surface tuning where you can calibrate
the sensor to your specific mouse pad
also first to improve accuracy
lastly you can play around with a few
options regarding the mouse's RGB
lighting which is a nice touch to the
chaos spectrum is a beast when gaming as
you'd expect did feel a little narrow on
my hand at first but I quickly got used
to this and the thought never crossed my
mind again thanks to its lightweight and
Industry best sensor it felt extremely
accurate in all types of games
rogue agents on the streets of New York
City quickly learn to simply run for
cover that's what I was telling myself
anyway overall the G 900 chaos spectrum
is a truly premium high-end gaming mouse
with a price tag to match it weighs in
at a fairly whopping 150 US dollars or
270 Australian dollars and that's that
price it's only going to be hitting the
mouse pads of quite well-off enthusiasts
or kids who are well on the night side
of Santa's ledger there are other mice
in the same price range though from
brands such as Razer and Mad Catz and
the G 900 could certainly be the best of
the bunch thanks for joining me for
another hardware unbox product review
I'm your host man as always and I'd love
to hear what you guys think in the
comments see you guys next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
