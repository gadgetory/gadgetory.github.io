another episode of unboxing boxes okay
well I'm gonna start with this box here
because it was sent in by a patreon
member and our patrons always send us
fun and exciting stuff so Tucker this
first and we'll go from there
before I do though I just realized I
need my knife one moment please
I should also note for those of you who
are relatively new to the channel who
have subscribed in the last few weeks we
do do this unboxing boxes segment once a
month usually and it's just a fun
somewhat pointless little series we do
actually goes for quite some time
usually 20 to 40 minutes and I just show
you guys what I have incoming or what
has arrived recently over the past few
weeks that we'll be getting to some of
the stuff you're at sea will provide
in-depth reviews on some of it we'll use
for other reviews or builds and stuff
like that yeah it's just to give you
guys some insight as to what we're
working on and the hard way we have as
it sort of comes in and of course we
also get some stuff like this from our
patreon members which well I don't know
let's see what we've got here first
seriously heavy not sure if I should
even do this but we'll uh we'll see what
happens
oh it looks like we have some snacks oh
boy do we have some snacks
looks like we have a lot of Asian snacks
this must be the doings of our patreon
members Ed's at our Hardy I think okay
so ever a big assortment of snacks there
for the unboxing process it looks like
we have a box attached or a box so it's
not just one big box it's a pair of
boxes okay this was the heavy part so
possibly some liquids in here we may
have a another series of drinks our
hands that we do okay I'm not going to
tip this out because it's gonna make a
huge huge mess I think what I'm gonna do
is because this episodes already going
to be ridiculously long for the hardware
I have to look at I couldn't actually
fit all of it on the table what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna maybe try one or
two of these and then I'm gonna take it
all to Tim's place tomorrow morning
because we're doing a light we're doing
the patreon livestream tomorrow we've
got the q and a's and then we're heading
the packs for to two to three days so oh
uh I'll just sample one or two of these
how we put the grass jelly drink I had
that last time actually want to give
that to Tim so I'll uh I'll put that
back in we've got a lot of interesting
looking things so I'm yeah sorry for
those of you who are interested to see
my reaction to all this but we'll
probably do on the livestream I think
tomorrow so anyway like I said I will
try one or two things I might try some
of them and I might try the green sands
original lime and Apple drink and I'll
put the rest away so we'll try that
another time we've just got too much
hardware to look at but thank you these
ads at our Hardy to sending more snacks
and drinks there's some seriously
interesting stuff you
we get to the drinks and food in a
moment I think we should start with our
first hardware box so I'll just grab
anything and we'll see what we got
not a hundred percent sure if these two
are meant to go together this one is
clearly from ek and I think I've ripped
all the shipping labels off this one but
I think this was also from Nek so we'll
start with this and we'll see what we
got
yes there is ek gear in here so inside
we have a CPU block the new ek velocity
RGB nickel and plexi block that's pretty
good if you guys recall I recently got a
whole lot of ek gear which made this
beast so if you have missed to that
series and you're interested you can go
watch that now we have the ek vector RTX
2080 RGB nickel block so to think it's a
blacked out block and take a closer look
at that in a second and we have I think
it's an acrylic version or plexi same
sort of deal oh this is a twenty-eight
ETI RGB block and that's what the screws
are coming from all the spices and stuff
they've set those what else have we got
here from ek they've set funny agreed by
looks of it
oh when I am d-block
this is another RGB velocity block what
socket is that for it looks like it's
Barbie I am for the am for based on what
it looks like on the front there plus
it's probably not big enough blocks to
be a TR for block ah awesome so to test
awesome back plates that's possible well
it wasn't what I was going to say
another back plate haha I'll get that in
a minute what I want is this so I'm
already running out of space to put all
the boxes okay so we have their slim 360
millimeter
kit so it's basically a starter kit as
it says start a liquid cooling kit so
you get a three sixty millimeter
radiator with three 120 millimeter fans
you get a little pump reservoir combo
you got a block and then the tubing if
you want to get into a water cooling
sort of your custom do-it-yourself
open-loop stuff these are where I'd
recommend just start because you get an
idea of how it all works the bits you
need we've recommended these in the Q&amp;amp;A
s before to people asking where they
should start these are really cool so
I'm here to get this kit but they
provided this kit so I have an easy way
to test these r-tx blocks because I want
to do that I want to see how they
perform what they allow us to do you
know expecting miracles but okay nice
quiet cool temperatures and testing and
this system would be a complete not a
nightmare not something I want to do so
thank you very much to ek for sending
all this gear over I'll actually we
don't have a huge we have as much time
as we want but I don't know how long you
guys are going to want to watch an
episode for and this one is going to be
probably a for dnews episode but I would
think we'll have a look at one of the
blocks anyway I might be role for the
others so as you can see looks very nice
love the plexi over the nickel-plated
block you see all the fluid if you have
some fancy fluids or even just the
standard stuff looks pretty good
and what would it be that way yeah
that's right so if it's sitting that way
in your system you see the g-force r-tx
up the right way so that's pretty cool
of course an inverted case it would be
the other way around we've got a little
bit on the entir archie x20 atti
so you can shop the visit 28 ET i card
that you've got I think very
nice-looking block keen to give it a go
you will see this on the channel soon or
test out how well it works so big thank
you to ek for setting all this gear over
hopefully in the not too distant future
I'll be able to show it off to in a
Content piece dedicated to cooling and
messing around with the RT AK series
graphics cards and yet also like to
check out these blocks as well I'll
probably put this one to use pretty
quickly
alright well since I have it on the
table already
we'll start with I've got another one of
these yeah there's a third one I'll go
look for the third one okay three small
boxes this one's heavier than the other
two so probably something different
pretty sure they're all from Corsair I
think one of them has memory so I can
fully populate this rig with eight
modules instead of four just four
modules Kahn was I thinking anyway let's
see what they got for us
let's just cut the cardboard oh this one
I packed it into it beautiful so we have
some more ddr4 3000 yep three thousand
four eight gigabyte sticks 32gb bucket
and is the Vengeance pro stuff in black
which is already what we've got in there
so we've got four sticks now we'll have
eight they argue that it's not entirely
necessary about whatever you know we can
all say was happy to provide it I'm
happy to put it in there and a look a
bit nicer so there's that yeah thank you
to Corsair for setting that over for a
set-piece rig okay these two I think
we've got their new SSD spoiler alert I
think that's what they're setting anyway
I have no idea what else it could be
it's too light to be memory unless it's
a some old-fashioned naked sticks with
no heat spreaders but who does that you
have to cut the top of this as well
all that for that I'll just check that
we've got the same deal in here or you
got quite a mess to clean up okay yep
mp5 tens that's the new Corsair m dot 2
and it is our proper m dot 2 so they had
the MP 500 before this I believe I'm
pretty sure I reviewed it was quite some
time ago now but these apparently better
value better endurance I think it's
quite competitive endurance actually
with the competition and I believe
looking at the box you that would
definitely be right it has extremely
impressive sequential read and write
performance so these things should be
blazing fast what do we got here - 960
gigabyte models and I think they sell
for about 270 us for a memory I looked
them up earlier I well a few days ago
and they said they were sending them and
I don't know if they're in Australia yet
so I don't have that information if I
find out I'll put it in a comment below
or in the description but yeah really
nice fast em not to drive so I won't
talking I'm too long because I will be
testing these and featuring them and
builds on the channel yeah I think it's
too much money to say they got a 5 year
warranty and pricing and performance
seems great so yeah keen to give them a
proper whirl for an actual real review
later on I'll grab this next one because
I also put this on the table a moment
ago this is actually a complete mystery
to me this one it's a very beaten up
creased box I think it's been sitting
around for a while now
let's open in amazement
what do we got what do we have ah it's
the new wall mounting kit some stuff
it's the new asrock desk mini 310 I
think it is the mystery will be solved
in a moment ok the astra asrock desk
mini series and you know what it does I
stand corrected there is the desk mini
310 version so this has the H 310
chipset on it and it is a budget version
of the desk mini having said that I have
no idea how much it sells for so I'm not
actually sure when it will go on sale
what is that hey bet your no one under
the age of 20 knows what that is
we've got power cords SATA cable power
adapter what we got here is a 19 volts 6
amps so pretty beefy I think this is
limited to 65 watt processors which is
what we saw with one of the earlier
models you can remove the limits but
then it's going to be a bloody loud
so I will be providing a review on this
in the not-too-distant future I
definitely want to review this little
guy yeah as you can see tiny tiny little
PC got display port HDMI USBs VGA power
input on the back mmm
type C and type yes so type-c USB and
3.1 presumably on the front two audio
jacks you could also talk me out some
stuff that isn't done here probably
should I open this up to give you a
quick look at what lurks inside okay
four screws I removed it just slides out
as a little like front IO connector
there and that's what you're looking at
so we have a naked chip here which is
the chipset the H 310 chip pair of
laptop style sodium modules you can put
up to 32 gigabytes so - 16 gigabytes
sticks and that will work on this
platform obviously the CPU socket you
can put any 65 watt as I said earlier
8th gen CPU then I advertised in the
ninth gen yet but it should support the
ninth gen CPUs not that I recommend
putting one of the eight core CPUs on
this board yeah that would be heavily
throttled it wouldn't blow the board up
or go poorly or anything well it did go
poorly in the sense that the CPU cooler
would be whizzing its little brain off
and to be heavily throttled and
performance wouldn't be nearly as good
as expected but it would work so there
is that we've got an MDOT to Wi-Fi slot
that is not populated m2 an m2 slot
that's not populated but we do have a
little package here that says MDOT to a
Wi-Fi kits now these won't be provided
this is sold as a bare bone so it'll be
a hundred and something dollars probably
don't expect much more than that
but there is a kit beer for the Wi-Fi so
you can adapt you get the module the
antenna all that sort of stuff and we
also get a kit to mount it to the back
of our monitor or something like that or
the wall or whatever you want to do but
that's that really Sony I'll test it out
with a few different CPUs see how
performs see what them
like you have to use the bots well
mostly you would be using the Box cooler
the one that comes with the locked CPUs
you wouldn't be using an unlocked CPU on
this so anyway that's probably enough
about that okay couple down let's get
another one as ROC motherboard I can see
asrock on the top corner oh it's one of
their new phantom gaming boards I'm
gonna put this okay then you phantom
gaming 9z 390 motherboard the big reveal
I will quickly take it out and see what
it's all about so this board is
currently selling for two hundred and
seventy dollars u.s. and as far as I can
tell it's not available in Australia
just yet so I obviously kind of
Australian pricing it's quite a nice
looking board we won't go through all
the accessories and everything we're
just doing a a quick and dirty unboxing
yes now the reason I wanted to take this
out was to see what the vrm
configuration was all about because it
looks like it's quite beefy but I wasn't
sure if that was just a fake deal or not
but it actually has doubles on the back
and a six double it will be a twelve
phase vehicle VRM I haven't fully pulled
it apart yet but I believe this is the
ir35 2:01 controller in a well it's
using six phases from the controller for
the vehicle to for the eye GPU and those
six phases are doubled using the ir35
nine eight doubles so you end up with
twelve power stages they are 40 amp
power stages I think the part number is
CSD eight seven three five zero so power
delivery on this particular board
certainly shouldn't be a problem it has
the new 2.5 gigabytes per second LAN so
I will be testing that out and seeing
how well that works
presumably it's a little over two times
better than what they used to with
Gigabit Ethernet and then everything
else is fairly standard we've got three
m2 ports three PCIe x 16 slots
not all of which are wired for eight
times bandwidth which is not surprising
on this platform primary slots time 16
seconds that looks like times 8 and the
thirds that looks like times for
bandwidth that is how they're wired 8
SATA ports pennyweight that is my quick
and dirty unboxing of this board yeah
looks pretty good
we'll know more about it very soon
because I'm going to be testing a hell
of a lot of these motherboards to see
how they perform in terms of erm
thermals and all that sort of stuff
so yeah stay tuned for that one ok it's
probably about time I had green sands
original lime and Apple drink so I don't
really like a lime I don't my small
doses I don't mind a lemon and a lime
apple like Y twice so I'll see what this
does for me actually smells really nice
yeah I mean it's not what I was
expecting it's actually very tame but
yeah quite quite like that's good thank
you for that one boo boo cake I'm not
sure I'm pronouncing that one correctly
let's just see what this is all about
that's what we're looking at it's kind
of I'll take the rest to share with Tim
and put them down there in a safe zone
smells pretty good like the drink it's
also very tame
yeah it just tastes like a really bland
cake so a little bit of flavor it's not
it's I mean I'm making it sound pretty
bad but it's fine actually the taste
comes on more after I can taste it a lot
more now it's quite nice at least it has
for me anyway cool well
yeah sorry I didn't do more of that to
the patreon member who sent that stuff
in but you'll get your money's worth
tomorrow I promise I'll be a lot more
entertaining with Tim on board all right
let's keep moving here because we've
been going for a while and I'm no any
half way I don't think oops oops oops
oops oops oops I totally forgot these
were being sent and have been sent okay
so firstly I should just apologize -
well you go by it and my gigabyte
contact because these boards did
technically make it in time for the day
one coverage and I didn't take them out
and have a look at them because I'm an
idiot and I completely forgot that
they'd sent them and they just ended up
in my huge pile of boxes to be unboxed
so yeah sorry gigabyte I didn't include
these I will make it up to you with some
coverage and from what I can tell these
are both very good quality motherboards
so they should farewell
much better than gigabyte has been
faring in my varam thermal testing so
yeah I expecting pretty big things from
these boards so I don't have any pricing
information on hand for either board
because I totally forgot I had them but
I'll quickly take them out I am
reasonably familiar that I believe is on
these boards in terms of their vrm
design okay I'm not 100% sure which one
of these boards is the higher-end board
would have been good to do some research
on these boards if I had I think yeah
the master is definitely a more
expensive board in the show
yep it's a very heavy board this one so
I can't see the back side of the board
properly I know this board has doublers
so this is a 12 core 12 core let me
start again
this is a 12 phase V core v RM it's a
genuine 12 faced so there's a 6 phase
controller
I think it's using the pro I think is
using the ISL 6 9 1 8 3 controller I
believe this is an IR controller on the
master again 6 phases this one I'm
honestly not sure how its configured
probably doubled but don't quote me on
that I will confirm when I do all the
proper tearing down of the board and
having a good look at what's on them but
this does have a pair of 8 pin power
inputs whereas this has an 8 plus 4 but
anyway they're both really good looking
motherboards this one has the master
let's put that one down safely so this
one it looks like they're making an
effort to make finned heat sinks at
least from this side you think okay
that'll work better than just a block of
aluminium however if you flip it around
we actually have a proper finned heat
sink on the back how well that's going
to work is anyone's guess we'll have to
test it it's not exactly gonna get a
huge amount of airflow cuz first of all
under a bit of plastic and the air has
to get through these slots here to go
through all those so hmm well that is
assuming that the air flow is coming
from whatever you have on the CPU socket
of course if you have case fans blowing
here into these they should work a
little bit better of course the air
slides to exit the fin stack anyway
that's all stuff we will test and work
out down the track yeah really
solid looking board overall it's got a
gigantic backplate if you need one of
those it has thermal pads that are
removing heat from the back of the vrm
area on the board so that could help
with vrm thermals okay enough about that
I will do a lot of in-depth testing on
these boards and hopefully you'll see on
their Channel
quite shortly oh yeah sorry to gigabyte
for forgetting about your really awesome
looking boards here because these bonds
do look really high-quality ok next box
rip through this this is one of those
boxes that is so well packed it's quite
challenging to get into actually sure
what's in this but whatever it is it's
well protected still no ID this is what
I'm looking at at the moment the hell is
that
ahaha that's what that is that box went
down with a serious thud but ok
nothing's broken
and it was just a empty box it was just
a heavy empty box okay so we're not
gonna bother taking this one apart
because it's just late to the party as I
said in my it was my day one I think it
was my day one coverage of the RT x 2070
that I was going to be receiving a
founders Edition card late and I would
take out of the box test power thermals
bass performance or the performers that
this producers test all that kind of
stuff and I'm gonna pass this on a Tim
so I'll do that tonight hopefully have
time after this video then I will take
it to Tim tomorrow and he has some other
tests and things lined up for this so
yeah that's that yeah might bother
opening it you guys I've already seen at
this point it's a bit late to the party
on that one so that's what was in that
box moving along
I might do that down here come on you're
too heavy not to cooperate
ah I think I know what this is those of
you who are familiar with this brand
will probably already have recognized
the logo but we have not featured this
brand on the channel before I've
actually never ever seen one of their
products before so I just rip to the box
bad start
we unbox this box three times so you got
your money's worth out of that one and
we'll do this the second time hopefully
this one goes at all smoothly that way
so for those of you sitting there in
suspense what does it see what have you
got what is it freaking out like that
it's chill it is the streak um I hope
I'm saying that right street streaked um
da2 so it's a case that's a really
really really cool case Hansen it's a
very small cap stuff's going everywhere
it's
it's a very small case farming you will
have seen smaller cases especially given
that it is a mini ITX case I mean it is
still very small but yeah I've seen
smaller mini ITX cases this particular
mini ITX case apart from looking truly
awesome very slick support some
seriously nice hardware so you can see
what I meant about slick it is a full
aluminium case chassis externally it is
all aluminium in fact there's pretty
much no plastic to speak of that from
maybe the button but even the
surrounding it's all over me so we've
got a type see on the front and that is
about it so around the back here we have
the i/o area where you put in your own
obviously all your motherboards IO stuff
piece a piece a pair a pair of expansion
slots for a full-size well pretty long
back that 20 this will fit in there I
believe will better get that in there
yeah you can put a dual slot card in
there then the power supply is obviously
internal because we've got the three
prong connector there I think you can
fit I was gonna say full-size which is
actually technically correct you can fit
ATX form factor PS using here but they
can't be I think over 14 centimetres
long
so specs real quickly Mini ITX
motherboards that's that's what support
so you can't go any bigger with micro
ATX or anything like that the maximum
CPU cooler height assuming that you go
for an air cooler would be 145 cent
millimetres 145 millimeters and then it
supports a dual slot graphics card up to
330 millimetres long which to be honest
covers most of them as for liquid
cooling if you're not using an air
cooler you can go a 120 or 280 or well
from 120 240 or 280 millimeter radiators
so that's pretty amazing in a case that
big and then as I said earlier the PSU
support extends to ATX but of course you
can get the SF s FX compact power
supplies in there all that kind of stuff
so
yeah nice compact case I'm not gonna
open it up and show you the inside I
will be testing this or I'll be doing a
build with this on the channel soon so
yeah I'm really excited to see how this
performs oh and just lastly it comes in
the black that you can see here or
silver
it weighs 3.9 kilos empty so about that
3.9 almost 4 kilograms and it has no RGB
lighting to speak of which they're very
proud of so it's a sleek discreet but
elegant looking case so no no fancy
flashy RGB of course you can put that
sort of stuff in it if you want that
might upset them but you can do that if
you want to okay unless I've lost some
boxes under all the boxes that have
unboxed we've got 2 left so we're doing
pretty good here I think
start with this little one here see
what's what we've got I have a feeling
I'm gonna regret that I mean it'll be ok
but given what I think this product is
that was not wise not wise at all
yeah that was actually pretty stupid
this is a 14 terabyte a bear recruiter
pro hard drive and for those of you at
home watching that's not the way to
unbox a 14 terabyte hard drive so yeah
be a bit more careful with them but
anyway the shock resistance will survive
that benchmark that I just did now but
yeah part of the fact this is a 14
terabyte Barracuda Pro hard drive I
don't have too much more to tell you
right now I will be testing it out and
featuring it in a few builds yeah it's a
mighty big harddrive great for backing
up all our videos which is what I will
be actually using it for is backing up
all our archiving all our older videos
for those of you wondering it's 550 US
for this particular model no idea what
it's worth in Australia because I don't
believe it's landed here yet the iron
wolf pro version that's 900 Australian
so yeah it's probably going to be
somewhere around that possibly not quite
as expensive but we'll see we'll see so
that's that almost a failed unboxing of
a really big expensive hard drive
potentially last I'll do a quick look
around
after I unbox this one because I have a
feeling there's a few things laying
about ah another brands that we haven't
featured on the channel before I haven't
looked at their products a very long
time ago this is scythe scythe I think
it is hopefully I'm pronouncing that
correctly the scythe ninja five these
guys were well-known in me or they still
are well-known in the air cooling
business and they reached out and said
we want to send over some air coolers
for you to check out and here is one
such cooler huh so pretty cool
screwdriver they're mounting gear to my
knowledge this works on every single
current and most of the past platforms
with the exception of thread Ripper so
note here to TR 4 rather TR 2 is thunder
4 to no TR for support
but it is as you probably guessed from
the box I rather large air cooler sort
of a squarish design and you will fasten
it to the socket or the mounting here by
going through the screwdriver this
custom-made long screwdriver
so yeah installation should be pretty
easy it's a very small base when I say
very small it's perfectly fine for a m4
your coffee like CPUs and all that kind
of stuff just won't work with thread
Ripper mostly because there's no
mounting gear for it to work with thread
Ripper but if it could mount to the
socket it wouldn't be ideal because it's
not offering 100% coverage got a pair of
120 millimeter fans like I so they've
got some vibration pads in the corner so
you can mount them in a push-pull
configuration on the heatsink in terms
of pricing again no idea what this is
worth
in Australia someone knows where it is
or who if anyone is selling it any
retailers are selling Australia just let
me know in the comment section below and
I'll update the description but it's
about $60 u.s. which is fairly typical
for a large air cooler to be honest and
it looks like it has got two four six so
that twelve so it's six I suppose you
could say dual heat pipes
there's b12 going up amongst all the
fins anyway three in each corner it's
quite weighty I think it's about 1.2
kilos memory compatibility should be
okay but that's something you've
obviously got these cut outs along the
sides here which help you get above some
taller memory sticks so that improves
compatibility and as far as I'm aware
these two 120 millimeter fans are ready
to spin quite slowly I think up to 800
rpm there spec sheet says so yeah that's
quite slow yes there's 800 rpm on this
little manual here but it's a big heat
sink so you don't really need super
layout fans so anyway that's that's that
one is that is that everything already
done them I must be missing something I
think that's everything I think I might
have forgotten to bring a few boxes in
here but we can do another episode in a
few weeks so those of you who have been
here
pounding me to another episode of
unboxing boxes you might get you might
get one in the next few weeks so you'll
get to possibly in the same month so
we'll see how we go but anyway I have to
really get moving on this one I've got a
quickly at this video get it up for you
guys to watch by the time you're
watching this I'll be at Tim's place we
would have already done our patreon
livestream that's happening tomorrow
which it will have like I said will have
happened for some filming this in
advance because I'm in a hurry and then
we're heading to pax so we're gonna be
covering the show probably doing two
videos at PAX we're doing a patreon
meetup so having some drinks with the
patreon members that should be good
might take some of these all and yes
pretty much everything for this episode
there'll be loads more benchmarks and
in-depth testing and things happening on
the channel so don't worry about that
massive Zee 390 vrm thermal comparison
and I also want to look at something
power limits or boards if they're really
low end boards do have power limits or
not because there's not really any
concrete information on that at the
moment so I want to dig into that and
see what's going on there and of course
he had the 19-hundred caper forms on
those lower end boards anyway that is
going to do it for this one I hope you
enjoyed this extremely rushed episode of
unboxing boxes and to power through
everything but I've given my reasons as
to why that was ok hope you enjoyed I'm
your host Steve see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
