probably noticed the Computex coverage
has ended Tim did give me a few days off
so that was nice Monday and Tuesday he
took care of the video so you would have
seen his mouth review and then his phone
review slow growth very good but anyway
in that time I wasn't exactly taking
time off I was doing quite a lot of
benchmarking for what's probably been
one of the most requested videos
probably in the last year and that is of
course the revisit of the geforce gtx
780 here one of the most powerful GPUs
that existed roughly four years ago
that's not why so many of you have been
asking for the test though or at least
it's not the main reason there's been a
huge amount of controversy surrounding
in videos GeForce 700 series which is
often referred to by its codename Kepler
and for those of you wondering the
Kepler architecture actually made its
debut with the GeForce 600 series the
geforce gtx 680 was the most powerful
GPU on the 600 series packing 1536
cuticles and a 294 millimeter squared
die the gtx 680 was later refreshed as
the gtx 770 with higher clocked gddr5
memory however shortly before that
happened in video led with the gtx 780 a
brand new bit of silicon the 780 boosted
the core count by whopping 50% taking
the die size to 561 millimeters squared
that wasn't the full silicon known as
the gtx 780 Ti followed six months later
with all 2880 CUDA cores enabled at the
time these big Kepler parts were mighty
impressive for example a GTX 780 landed
in May of 2013 and back then it proved
to be on average 24 percent faster than
the GTX 680 in my test and 16 percent
faster than the Radeon HD 7970
gigahertz Edition so as I said the GTX
780 was king of the hill for six months
till the GTX 780 Ti arrived however it
was AMD's Radeon r9 290 series that were
the real issue and the arrival of the
294 sim video into some rather hefty
price cuts slashing the GTX 780 from its
initial MSRP of $650 to $500 u.s. so
even here it was a rather weak
proposition against the cheaper and fast
r9 290 according to my own testing
conducted back in November of 2013 the
r9 290 was slightly faster in
battlefield 3 Crysis 3 Far Cry 3 Medal
of Honor Warfighter Metro last light and
BioShock Infinite meanwhile the r9 290
was a good bit faster in battlefield 4
dirt 3 Max Payne 3 sleeping dogs and
hitman absolution in fact the only game
with the gtx 780 came out on top who was
Tomb Raider so the GTX 780 started on
the back foot and the r9 290 was always
as faster often slightly faster the
problem a lot of gamers have is that
over the past you use kepler based
graphics cards such as the gtx 780 have
continued to fall away whereas the r9
290 and it's reincarnation the r9 390
are still able to hold their ground
today it said that the gtx 780 has
fallen a heap and as a result struggles
against modern day entry-level GPUs so
to find out what's going on I've taken
22 new titles and tested them at 1080p
and 1440p to see how the once-mighty
geforce gtx 780 compares to the more
modern GPUs in place of the r9 290 r9
390 will be stepping in and while I'm
sure many of you would have liked to
have seen the Unown 290 in this battle
let's be honest clock for clock there's
little to no difference between the 290
and the 390 also included is the gtx 970
and the gtx 1050 Ti
so it'll be interesting to see where the
gtx 780 slots into that picture towards
the end of the video i will be showing
some side-by-side gameplay footage as
well and finally all testing was
conducted using our core i7 7700 k test
system clocked at 4.9 gigahertz and of
course the latest AMD atom video display
drivers available the timer testing were
used so let's jump into the benchmarks
kicking things off we have Rises the
Tomb Raider and here the three gigabyte
gtx 780 struggles with the minimum frame
rate only managing to edge ahead of the
gtx 1050 i buy a few frames
an average frame rate of 72 FPS at TP
isn't bad though this does only position
the 780 between the 1050 Ti and rx 470 /
r9 390 the 1440p results are much the
same though the minimum frame rate looks
much better in comparison to the RX 470
and r93
only now that said the average framerate
is still quite a bit off the pace at 46
FPS to the r9 390 s 55 FPS the GTX 780
isn't a great deal slower than the 970
and far cry primal at 1080p and this
meant it was 25% faster than gtx 750ti
that said it was 17% slow in the r9 390
which was good for an average of 63 fps
the margins grew ever so slightly at
1440p here the GTX 780 was 20% slower
than the r9 390 and still a few frames
behind the RX 470 still the GTX 780 is
now almost 30% faster than the GTX 1050
TI this time testing with Tom Clancy's
the division the GTX 780 finds itself
situated right between the gtx 1050 TI
and gtx 970
this man at 1080p it was 20% slower than
the iron 390 moving to 1440p the remoter
remains much the same the GTX 780 was
24% faster than the 1050 TI and 14%
slower than the 970 and this puts it
well off the pace of the r9 390 as well
as the current generation mid-range
contenders
well the hitman results are very
interesting whereas the GTX 780 has
previously been found somewhere between
the 1050 Ti and 970 it's pretty much on
par with the 1050 TI this time making it
one of the slowest GPUs tested of course
this is an AMD sponsored title but still
the r9 390 was 74% faster the unknown
390 is now 82% faster at 1440p and again
the GTX 780 is only able to match the
GTX 1050 TI
hit man's the most recently released
game we've tested so far so she'll be
interesting to see how things develop
through the next 18 games well this is
rather unexpected just as we saw the GTX
780 get completely obliterated and
hitman we now see it pulling away from
the GTX 970 and quantum break it's also
not a great deal sold in the r9 390 at
least when compared to the previous
titles the 780 does drop off the pace at
1440p though it's still able to match
the GTX 970 so that's certainly not a
poor result the GTX 780 also performs
reasonably well overwatch at 1080p with
an average of 149 fps and that places at
roughly on par with the r9 3
in fact it was just 4% swallow the GTX
780 remains strong at 1440p as it turns
in a rather strong minimum frame rate
when looking at the average frame rate
it was able to match the RX 470 while it
wasn't too much lower than the r9 390
term was never going to be gentle with
the gtx 780 and here we see a very large
dip in the minimum frame rate please be
aware the minimum frame rate is based on
an average of three runs so this isn't
some kind of one-off dip in performance
although the GTX 780 did keep the frame
rate above 60fps at all times we see
that frame rates did fluctuate quite a
bit here moving a 1440p the variance
between the minimum and average frame
rate isn't as extreme but even so
overall the gtx 780 didn't look
particularly impressive in Doom
especially when compared to the gtx 970
and r9 390 for total war Warhammer the
GTX 780 was tested using DirectX 11 as
it doesn't support DX 12 in this style
even so performance was excellent as the
780 match 210 63 gigabyte and the GTX
970 at 1080p moving to 1440p the 780
dropped off the pace ever so slightly
though for the most part provided
comparable performance to the GTX 970
1063 gig about an Rx 470 it was also
significantly faster than the GTX 1050
to I hear testing with Mirror's Edge
catalyst shows fairly consistent
performance across the mid-range GPUs
along with the Titans of ESD such as the
GTX 780 and r9 390 in fact give the GTX
780 and r9 390 are quite evenly matched
though the radio and did offer slightly
better minimum frame rate performance
jumping to 1440p the GTX 780 slips away
a little and is now roughly on par with
the RX 470 this isn't a bad result for
the 780 and frankly this is where I
would expect to see it in relation to
the r9 390 and here we are back to very
mediocre performance the GTX 780 turned
out just 55 FPS at stereo P in f1 2016
and this positioned it between the 1063
gigabyte and 1050 Ti that made it much
slower than the GTX 970 and r9 390 here
at 1440p the GTX 780 really did know
better as it trailed the r9 390 by a 22
percent margin with
average frame rate of just 42 FPS the
GTX 780 also sucked when it came time to
play Deus Ex mankind divided averaging
just 38 fps at 1080p to the r9 390 s 56
fps this time that was found sitting
between the gtx 750ti &amp;amp; GTX 970 the
1440p resolution crushes the midfield in
this title and despite providing
completely unplayable performance the
GTX 780 wasn't much slower than the
three gigabyte 1060 here we see the GTX
780 wasn't able to average just over 60
FPS at turning P in battlefield 1 which
is of course playable performance
despite being much slower than the GTX
970 and r9 390 1440 Peter hammered the
GTX 780 and now is just 6 FPS fast and
the gtx 750ti
and a lot slower than everything else
tested well mark III doesn't exactly
play well with current generation
hardware so I wasn't expecting the GTX
780 to deliver much that said it was
able to match the RX 470 albeit with an
average of just 38 fps much the same
we're seen at 1440p though here the GTX
780 did match the r9 390 though again
both averaged under 30fps so it's not
really a noteworthy result the GTX 780
struggles with Gears of War 4 and is
well down on the GTX 970 and r9 390 in
fact the 780 sat closest to the GTX 1050
to a 1080p with an average of just 56
fps jumping to 1440p slaughters the GTX
780 and now it's seen delivering 1050 TI
light performance positioning at miles
behind the pack despite offering a
reasonably smooth 60fps at all times the
GTX 780 was still the slowest graphics
card tested and titanfall 2 the GTX 1052
is surprisingly fast in this title as a
result the GTX 780 came in last place
moving to 1440p allowed the 780 to claw
its way out of last place if only just
still here the performance was very
competitive across most of the graphics
cards tested the GTX 780 completely
tanked in Civilization 6 at least when
compared to the competition here it was
slower than even the GTX 1050 Ti with an
average of 53 FPS at
EP moving to 1440p the modes remain much
the same here the GTX 780 was roughly on
par with the 1050 - I'm making at the
slowest GPU tested Call of Duty infinite
warfare soar the 780 just be able to
deliver acceptable performance at 1080p
with an average of 60 fps that made it
13% slower than the GTX 970 and 18%
slower than the r9 390 surprisingly
though the 780 actually closed in this
time at 1440p or at least it did on the
GTX 970 anyway it was still 18 percent
slower than the Radeon r9 390 the
watchdogs 2 performance was quite
typical the GTX 780 was 18% fast and the
1050 TI TEP but it was also 15% slower
than the r9 390 so margin is reduced at
1440p and now the GTX 780 is just 11%
slower than the r9 390 that said though
the minimum frame rate is quite low and
this is something we've seen quite a bit
from the GTX 780 the Resident Evil 7
biohazard results look fairly typical
here the GTX 780 finds itself situated
between the gtx 1050 TI and the 1063
gigabyte though it was a good bit slower
than the RX 470 the 780 also trailed the
r9 390 by 42% margin so this is another
title where we see the kepler based GPU
aging very poorly the margins are much
the same at 1440p and here once again
the mighty GTX 780 struggles to and
deliver playable performance with an
average of just 39 FPS furada isn't a
hugely demanding title this is evident
by the GTX 780 performance as it managed
to match the RX 470 with almost 70 FPS
at 1080p this placed the GTX 780 within
striking distance of the GTX 970
then even at 1440p we find similar
results and here the mid-range graphics
cards are all quite similar a very
competitive performance scene and the
GTX 780 was well in the mix praised are
very well optimized title of GTX 780 had
no trouble delivering highly playable
framerates at 1080p in fact it wasn't a
great deal slower than the RX 470 though
it did trail the GTX 970 and r9 390 by
over 10 FPS moving to 1440p we once
again find similar results and even at
this resolution the GTX 780
was able to provide smooth gameplay
finally they have Dawn of War three and
well these the results that we've pretty
much come to expect by this point the
GTX 780 was found sitting between the
GTX 1050 TI and GTX 10 63 gigabyte
making it around 20% slower than the r9
390 as we've found quite a few times the
GTX 780 is able to catch up at 1440p
though that said this resolution has
pretty much broken this GPU more than a
few times anyway here at average 47 fps
placing that alongside the GTX 10 63
gigabyte and that meant it was just a
single frame slower than the GTX 970 and
RX 470 so two weeks ago I revisited the
r9 390 and plenty of you were pretty
keen to give it a hard time over power
consumption well I get to the GTX 780 is
technically an older GPU but still it
consumes quite a lot more power
increasing total system consumption by
11 percent over the r9 390 the GTX 780
wasn't a great deal faster than 1050
turn a lot of the games tested yet it
increased total system consumption by
almost 140 percent for those running a
780 you will require a 500 watt power
supply to avoid running into any
problems ok so that's all 22 games in
the bag and yet we do still have a few
more results to look at in a moment but
before we do that let's have a look at
the average performance from all the
games just tested at 1080p and 1440p
then just briefly we will see how the
GTX 780 compares to GPU such as the r9
390 and gtx 750ti
in a few older titles so first up let's
check out those averages here we see
that on average the GTX 780 was 23%
faster than the GTX 1050 Ti verse 15 %
slower than the RX 470 and GTX 970 not
only that but when compared to the r9
390 it was 20% slower now on launch day
for the r9 290 it was just a few percent
faster than the GTX 780 then the r9 390
arrives and it delivered around 10
percent more performance than the 290 on
average so it seems over the years the
margin has basically doubled for the
margins to have remained much the same
we would expect to see the GTX 780
averaging around 70 fps
TEP and not the 60fps that we see out of
interest I thought let's take a look
back at a few older games starting with
Metro last light here we see even today
using modern drivers the GTX 780 and r9
390 provide very similar or basically
the same performance what's also
interesting to note here is that while
the GTX 780 was just 20% faster than the
1052 iron modern games
it's almost 50% faster he when looking
at the average frame rate the same is
true for the r9 390 whereas it was on
average 7% faster than the RX 470 in
modern titles it's 20% faster here to
quickly verify the Metro last light
results I quickly ran the sleeping dogs
benchmark again the r9 390 and GTX 780
were pretty much neck-and-neck
there was just a slight variation in the
minimum frame rate meanwhile the GTX 780
was almost 30% faster than 1050 Ti and
20% faster than the rx 470 before
wrapping things up here's three minutes
worth of gameplay footage comparing the
GTX 780 GTX 1050 TI and r9 390
side-by-side I don't know you guys like
seeing the footage side by side so I
thought I'd include this towards the end
but for those of you who prefer the
graphs aren't really interested in
watching the gameplay footage then you
can skip ahead there will be a video
index in the description to show you
where the conclusion starts
you
so maybe it's quite hard to believe that
the geforce gtx 780 is roughly four
years old now i guess that says though
it really used to having a show at age a
780 was just 23% faster than the 1050 TI
that's pretty crazy given the GPU is
physically four times larger packs more
than twice as many transistors and
consumes well over twice as much power
when compared to the r9 390 the gtx 780
hazlit further behind it's no secret
that the kepler architecture just hasn't
aged that well it's either down to the
architecture itself or nvidia neglecting
driver development or perhaps a bit of
both either way we've never seen in
video architecture fall away like Kepler
has I don't expect the same to happen to
the Maxwell based GPUs any time soon but
of course I'll keep my eye on
performance for those of you considering
picking up a GTX 780 to try and save
some money my advice would be don't
bother I currently the performance is
sketchy at best some tiles are okay
while others were just horrible
so like I said sketchy at best but if
you're willing to tweak the visual
settings at 1080p then you can achieve
smooth playable performance in pretty
much all titles but again keep in mind
that power consumption still going to be
very ugly especially when compared to
similar performance current generation
GPUs pricing for the GTX 780 graphics
cards online is surprisingly high people
are still asking over $100 us for these
things most of listed on eBay for
between 120 and 150 dollars us giving
you can pick up a GTX 1052 i4 around
$130 us this would be my preferred
option it might be a slow graphics card
but it's also world's more efficient and
therefore it will run cooler and quieter
right now AMD graphics cards are pretty
much out of the question thanks to -
tapping them all up I would have
suggested the rx 470 or rx 570 but good
luck finding one of them right now
anyway that's going to do it for this
one I'm your host Steve see you again
soon guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
