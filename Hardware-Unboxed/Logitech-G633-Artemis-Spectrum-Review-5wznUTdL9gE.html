I'm your host Matt and today I've got my
hands on Logitech's new flagship wide
gaming headphones the g63 3 Artemus
spectrum firstly let me just say that I
absolutely love getting a new pair of
gaming headphones especially when they
look and feel as good as these do the
g63 Artemus spectrum and the wide
sibling to the G 933 also named Artemus
spectrum in logitech's new flagship
gaming headphone line bursting a true
wealth of features they truly feel like
they're built from the ground up with
gamers in mind but we'll get to all
these features later let's first have a
closer look at the aesthetics and the
build quality first
in typical Logitech style the G 633 is a
light and nearly completely made from
plastic but the plastic certainly have a
high-quality feel starting at the top
the headband has a flexible plastic cap
that crowns the Logitech Gaming G
there's a soft and light sports mesh
covered foam panel the rest against your
head and the headphone arms extend and
retract with just the right amount of
tension I'm just giving a tactile feel
proving Logitech have focused on the
smaller details with this headset is
even a numbering system imprinted on the
aluminium arm so you can dial them in
every time and the strip that runs down
the center of this arm is even made from
a soft pliable rubber and features the
arrows that you can find elsewhere on
the headset looking further down the arm
the headphone cradle I'm making these
hands up is made entirely from plastic
but it gives a high quality charcoal
metallic look both sides are printed
with the g63 3 model number and it's
shaped in lines one of the best aspects
of the design these cradles allow for
plenty of pitch and rotation so they
should suit all kinds of weird shaped
heads the speaker case on the headphones
is made from a smooth feeling plastic
and there's an awesome RGB strip between
small black steps to give me a kind of
futuristic reptile feel maybe as opposed
to the overdone tron look that would
otherwise give them without them the g63
3 is also feature a removable speaker
caps which Logitech will of course make
customized cuts for their eSports gaming
teams
these held on with a small plastic arm
and two small magnets and they pop off
nice and easily but also not too easily
the stock caps are imprinted with a
remove panel instruction they feature
three lines similar to those found on
the RGB strip and on top of the headband
and are emblazoned with an illuminated
logitech gaming gene the actual ear cups
themselves of something I loved on the
previous Logitech g4 30s and they're a
big part of the reason I use them
day-to-day again logitech delivered on
the g6 three threes held by a leather
feeling wrap the ear cuffs are both big
enough to fit my big ears in their
entirety which to me is something
absolutely essential and they're
extremely comfortable I like that
logitech uses such light soft foam
covered by the sports mesh for these ear
cups to me they strike the balance
between making you feel like you're in
your own world enough but not completely
isolating you from humanity meaning at
least if someone breaks in the house
behind you you have a slight chance of
noticing now let's take a look at all
the features that Logitech have crammed
into this headset first of all the fluid
connectivity included the box is both a
three and a half mil cable and a micro
USB cable at the base of the left
earpiece you can connect both of these
cables simultaneously and you can switch
between inputs with the flick of a
switch at the top of the left earpiece
the micro USB cable is long and truly
intended for PC use as represented on
the switch although it also allows for
ps4 connectivity using this cable with
your PC allows you to use the three
programmable G keys as well as the
scrolling volume wheel found on the back
of the earpiece beneath the previously
mentioned switch I don't really use the
programmable macro keys at all so I
can't say I found these Keys
particularly useful but for someone that
does they would be great if you like to
use different sound profiles for
instance then you could switch between
these on the fly using the 3G keys I
also like that Logitech has made all
three of these G keys completely
different shapes so you can feel which
one you're pressing without taking off
the headset and looking we found is a
volume wheel and found myself quickly
using that to adjust the volume on the
go often if something that makes sense
about adjusting the volume on your
headset rather than your keyboard or in
Windows finally there's a dedicated
microphone mute button amongst these
rear keys to the three and a half mil
cable
wrapped in braided fabric and is suited
for use with your foam but can also be
used with an Xbox one the PC games would
like to settle in for a long session you
can connect your phone by the three and
a half mil jack and your PC via the USB
cable and then simply hit the switch at
the back of the headset to switch inputs
when a phone call comes in or more
realistically to order pizza the three
and a half mil cable is a bit shorter
than USB cable and also features an
inline microphone the remote that allows
you to play pause media adjust volume
toggle between the microphones and mute
the inline mark even the cable is cooled
the remote case styling is in line with
the rest of the headset and the features
of Logitech game in blue the Logitech
Gaming software looks cool is easy to
use and I've always found to be reliable
the first time I installed it prompted
me to perform a firmware update on the
g63 3s which simply involved clicking
next and unplugging and re-plugging the
headset and even that went smoothly at
the front of the left ear pieces the
foldaway noise cancelling mic which i've
used to record this section to give you
an idea of how it sounds the tip of the
microfiche is a little LED indicator to
let you know when the mic is on mute
which is a cool little feature and the
broom is also extendable the recording
quality through the markers as it expect
but I think the noise canceling feature
is extra cool especially for your
teammates I recorded this sentence
leaning right in next to a PC with the
case door open to give you an example as
you can hear the noise cancelling mic
works quite well within the software you
configure the programmable G keys with
profiles for all of your different games
you can completely control the RGB
lighting colors patterns lighting zones
and configure a sleep timer and sound
wise you can also select and adjust
different equalizer presets as well as
create your own and the 7.1 surround
sound levels can all be tweaked - and
even customized for each profile the g63
3 feature of Dolby 7.1 surround sound
set off using Logitech spur G audio
drivers that sound great to me the mids
and highs are clear and the base is
punchy enough to enjoy music although
gaming is really what this speakers are
designed to do well the surround sound
works great in game you can get a clear
directional perception of the sounds
coming in
you're in-game to make the most of the
7.1 surround sound though you do need to
have the Logitech Gaming software
installed pretty much my only criticism
of the g4 30s was that the volume was a
little weak I used them on a plane
recently and I could barely hear
anything with the volume on max this
seems to have been addressed with the
g63 threes as I never really went about
50% volume and they were plenty loud one
thing I do feel was missing from this
product was a carry case or pouch
Logitech is pitching this is both a
mobile and premium product so I feel
like it's definitely something that
should have been included coming in at
an MSRP of one hundred and fifty dollars
the g63 3s aren't cheap they don't feel
or function cheap either if you want a
premium headset with lots of features
and a good quality microphone then the G
633 is won't disappoint thanks for
watching another episode of hardware

to hear what you guys think of the g63
3s in the comments and on our forum at
