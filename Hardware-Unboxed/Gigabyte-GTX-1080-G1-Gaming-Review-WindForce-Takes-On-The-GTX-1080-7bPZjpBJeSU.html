world Nvidia first announced that
GeForce GTX 1080 at the beginning of May
at a press day in Austin Texas ten days
later the embargo was lifted and
reviewers such as myself could release
our results a further 10 days down the
track the 1080 became publicly available
on May 27th and sold out shortly after
the initial release however was for the
founders Edition which is essentially a
grossly of a price reference card the
partner board models woulda come at a
later date though the exact date hasn't
been made clear historically
AMD and videos partners do a much better
job of building a graphics card around
the GPU we expect things to be no
different this time despite in videos
bold claims that the fans Edition will
be the best 1080 to hit the market I'm
pretty sure a board Pi thank you goodbye
might have something to say about that
and well in a way they have by
responding with the GeForce GTX 1080 g1
gaming graphics card and we'll take a
look at this beauty today so first what
makes the 1080 g1 gaming so special well
gone is the dreaded louis-style cooler
and replacing it as gigabytes windforce
3x cooler with blade design fans larger
heatsink has been complemented with
three copper heat pipes featuring a
direct touch design which means the
copper pipes come in direct contact with
a GPU surface these aren't just any old
heat pipes either gigabyte says the
composite heat pipes to combine both
thermal conductivity and phase
transition which improves heat transfer
between two solid interfaces improving
the cooling capacity by 29% the heatsink
uses the tried-and-true gigabyte
triangle cool technology which combines
the fins with an aluminium clip module
which further enhances heat dissipation
giving the g1 gaming cooler bit of bling
is yep you guessed it RGB lighting what
do you think it needs that are not
gamers can enjoy 16.8 million
customizable color lighting which can be
adjusted using the extreme engine
utility which I'll check out shortly
sadly with the g1 gaming no major
changes have been made to the PCB so
we're still limited to a single 8 pin
PCI Express power connector the g1
gaming is gigabytes mainstream GC X 1080
offering the more extreme version will
be known as the extreme gaming model and
will feature dual 8 pin PCIe connectors
and a redesigned PCB the g1 gaming is
the
that we can expect to hit that $600 MSRP
at some point while the extreme gaming
likely be priced closer to the founders
Edition $700 MSRP still while the g1
gaming isn't gigabytes amidst extreme
offering it is far from sedate and
despite the same power input
configuration the PCB has been reworked
and upgraded gone is the five plus one
phase power design of the founders
edition we now have an 8 + 2 phase power
design for better load balancing which
will improve stability and lower
temperatures particularly went
overclocked
included in the packaging of the highest
grade chokes and capacitors which is all
part of gigabytes ultra durable
materials on the backside of the g1
gaming you'll find a full-length
backplate protecting the card and the
sleek design also looks very cool giving
a clean look another important
performance characteristic at the
factory overclocked core memory clock
speeds gigabyte provides two operating
modes which are called gaming mode and
OC mode the Nvidia reference speed calls
for a core clock speed of 1607 megahertz
and gigabyte has increased this by 5% to
1695 megahertz
allowing for a boost clock of 1835
megahertz the OC mode takes things
further providing a 7 percent overclock
with the base clock of 1721 megahertz
and a boost clock of 1860 megahertz of
course using gigabytes extreme engine
we're going to try and push things even
further finally around the i/o end of
the graphics card we find a dueling DVI
port an HDMI 2.0 B port and three
DisplayPort 1.4 ports it is possible to
drive a single 8k display using a pair
of display ports you know just in case
you have an 8k panel lying around so
while you pondered that let's get back
into the benchmarks first up we're
taking a look at the results in ARMA 3
at 1440p here you can see the gaming
mode netted us basically the same
performance as the founders Edition OC
mode delivered a tiny amount of extra
performance and a maximum overclock
barely PIPP the fans Edition overclocked
by a single frame 4k told the same story
here OC mode was able to grab a single
extra frame as did a custom overclock
which gave us 44 frames on average and
the exact same performance as the
founders Edition card the bigger numbers
in battlefield resulted in slightly
bigger frame margins between the cards
gaming mode was again identical to the
founders Edition card OC mode gained 3
FPS and our custom overclock was able to
net 40 more FPS
giving the card a 2 fps
we and over the overclocked reference
card the performance trend was the same
at 4k but this time OC mode only netted
us one extra frame our custom overclock
allowed the gigabyte card to make 63 FPS
for a single frame victory over the
founders Edition okay so you guys are
starting to get the idea the division
tells us the exact same story and I'm
not going to bore the hell out of you by
saying the same thing over and over I'll
show you the 4k results next followed by
the performance in Doom Just Cause 3 Far
Cry primal and Star Wars Battlefront
you'll see in each game that the maximum
overclock is as good as even with the
founders addition overclock and the
difference between the stock clock
founders versus the g1 game is gaming
mode and OC mode is pretty much
negligible the custom overclock results
are no doubt a bit disappointing as the
g1 gaming is really no faster than the
overclock founders Edition card despite
running at least 10 degrees cooler in
all of our tests the gigabytes g1 gaming
1080 didn't allow for any more of a
clocking headroom pushing the g1 gaming
further caused artifacts and eventual
crashing despite temperatures staying in
check given what I found with the g1
gaming I really questioned if those
extreme vrm cards will be able to push
the 1080 core much higher something else
worth pointing out is the fact that
although at g1 gaming base clock is
higher than what we were able to achieve
with a Founders Edition graphics card
the resulting performance was much the
same this is due to the boost clock
which was throttled down below 2
gigahertz after 10 minutes of gaming
despite temperatures never exceeding 74
degrees Celsius the average operating
frequency was 1949 megahertz and this
did cause the g1 games fan spin up to an
audible 2,300 rpm while it wasn't loud
it was comparable to the founders
Edition operating at around 40 to 50%
fan speed out of the box the power
consumption is a couple of what's higher
than the standard 1080 so I focused on
my custom overclock to give you guys an
idea for the maximum draw you're going
to see from this card you can see on
this graph that at most our average
total system consumption was 292 watts
26 watts higher than what we saw from
the stock clock reference card this
isn't huge and really comes down to the
fact that we weren't really able to
overclock the card significantly ok so
admittedly that wasn't as impressive or
as exciting as I'd hoped that said I'm
not exactly sure what I was expecting so
let's try and put all this into
perspective compared to the fans Edition
1080 the g1 gaming runs cooler quite a
bit cooler so that's a huge plus the
card does however dissipate heat
directly into the case
for the card to outperform the fans
edition you need to ensure you have a
decent case cool you set up the
operating volume while quiet isn't
significantly better than the fans
edition in my opinion if anything I
think in video are too focused on the
operating volume of the bounds edition
when set to auto the fan barely spins up
on my card at all the gigabyte extreme
engine is a very nice utility and I'd
happily use this over a popular
alternative such as MSI Afterburner out
of the box the g1 gaming is faster than
the founders Edition though the margins
weren't exactly significant still you
are getting more performance and no
extra cost
in fact as it stands the g1 gaming 1080
is $50 cheaper in both the US and
Australia when compared to the founders
Edition at 650 us the g1 gaming isn't
yet selling for the advertised $600 u.s.
MSRP but with limited stock it'll
probably be a few weeks or even months
before we see $600 gtx 1080 is available
overall the gigabyte geforce gtx 1080 g1
gaming is a very nice graphics card that
takes in videos current flagship GPU and
pairs it with a better performing cooler
while offering a little extra
performance out of the box
it isn't world better than the fans
edition like many of us had hoped but
this isn't gigabytes fault and it seems
like there simply isn't a headroom for
those rumored 2.2 to 2.4 gigahertz
overclocks gigabyte does have a more
extreme model capable of feeding the GPU
even more power so I'll definitely be
keen to see if that model takes things
to the next level what do you guys think
of the gaming g1 let me know in the
comments and hit subscribe if you
haven't yet to get coverage of all the
upcoming new gen graphics cards I'm your
host Matt as always and I'll see you
guys next time YouTube</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
