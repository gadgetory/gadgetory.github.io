your host Matt and today I'll be taking
you on a tour through some knowledge
ease RT 1980 router Synology are best
known for their network attached storage
devices but now looking to break into
the other side of the networking market
with their new RT 1980 router at first
glance it's certainly nothing remarkable
in fact it looks pretty much like every
other router made in the last 10 years
but as they say in the router game it's
what's on the inside that counts
thankfully Synology didn't just set all
to pump out another clean router with
the clunky ugly and hives used interface
and attempt to purely compete on price
hardware wise it's up to all the latest
home router standards including dual
channel wireless AC boosting up to 1.9
gigabit combined throughput along with
the technologies like beamforming that
it brings there's four Gigabit LAN ports
a WPS button and a Wi-Fi on/off switch
LED indicators that you can schedule to
switch off at night and something else a
little different a USB 3 port and an SD
card slot that provide nasa-like
capabilities which really set this
router apart so Knology has also looked
to take it to user friendliness software
and adapt it to the RT 1980 and
personally I think they've done a great
job the best way to give you guys an
understanding of the UI is to take you
on a personal tour
so strap yourselves in we're going to
192.168.1.1 land the physical setup is
straightforward screwing the three Wi-Fi
antennas plug in the power and when
cables and press the power button you
should be good to go the next step is
simply head to router Dotson ology comm
and you should be met with this
installation wizard follow the simple
step-by-step process and fill in your
particulars and you should be ready to
go you can configure all of your Wi-Fi
security and other network settings here
in the network Center where the common
settings are easy enough to find yeah
power users can still set up wireless
access points in bridge mode only allow
specific MAC addresses to it
the network and you can even set up a 3G
or 4G dongle if you don't have wired
Internet access
in the parental control section you can
block certain devices from accessing the
Internet during set hours allow you to
block your kids access during homework
hours for example and you can also block
your kids devices access to specific
websites such as Facebook including even
the mobile app you can even configure
application layer QoS optimization I
mean you can assign how much bandwidth
the device can consume when it's using a
specific application for instance
YouTube on your child's iPad or similar
remote access to manage your router and
the devices connected to it can be
configured in the internet section and
Synology provides an optional Quick
Connect ID service to make it simple the
status tab is attractive and useful
displaying real time speeds connected
devices and CPU and memory usage if you
want to know which device or application
is using the most damn width you can use
the monitor under traffic control to
view and record these statistics the
administration section is where you can
schedule that IDs to turn off at night
time which is particularly useful if you
sleep in the same room as the router and
you can set up email SMS or even push
service notifications which connect to
the das router iOS and Android apps in
the notification section security wise
there's everything you'd expect from a
router in this price range WEP all
varieties of WPA guest network
capabilities custom firewall dus
protection IP auto block and custom
certification there's also a security
adviser that does things like scan for
malicious programs and weak passwords
and let you know of any security
warnings now for the nats lock features
that really set this router apart you
can connect an external hard drive or
plug in an SD card and access the files
on it anytime and from anywhere with an
internet connection from windows or a
Mac computer you can also of course
stream videos music or images to any
DLNA or UPnP devices like a smart TV and
even configure which users can access
certain folders on the storage devices
wake-on-lan is also supported finally
the IT 1980 takes care of all your
server needs
you can enable an FTP server to remotely
download large files search for download
torrent files using the download station
function plug in a USB printer and have
it act as a network printer and you can
even set up a VPN server DNS server or
radius server directly on the router
which is great for small and medium
businesses so as you can see the RT 1980
is certainly feature-rich and sonali
just done a fantastic job of making the
software attractive easy to use and
powerful however wise there's not much
to complain about however I think it
would have been great if there have been
at least two USB 3 ports if those who
want to connect either a printer and a
hard drive or multiple hard drives were
yet to get a solid MSRP but I think the
RT 1980 you provide pretty good valued
around $200 when the pricing information
does come out I'll be sure to update the
