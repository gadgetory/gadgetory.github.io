making it possible for hardware box to
attend Computex 2019 please check out
their latest gaming and create a desktop
range powered by Intel Core ninth gen
processes via the link in the
description also a thank you to Corsair
for their support check out their new
products again via links below welcome
back to hard run box we're here at the
team group booth and I'll be honest
there's a lot of really cool products
here we've got this our GB SSD that is
probably the best-looking RGB I've seen
on an SSD yet so we'll get to checking
that out in just a moment I think we
also saw some liquid-cooled M not too
SSDs they've got their PCIe 4 SSD as
well so well let's get into it I want to
start here with the t4 Delta max our GB
SSD because it's by far the best-looking
2.5 inch SSD I've seen so far previous
team group RGB SSDs looked pretty good
and had a massive bright RGB array but
this new SSD takes things to the next
level it almost looks as if the front of
the SSD is a small LCD screen but it's
actually just a densely packed RGB LED
array with some diffusers that create
that awesome effect this new design is a
lot slicker than team groups previous
model and I think will complement a lot
of builds really nicely and for those
that don't appreciate the RGB lighting
the drive even looks good with it
disabled thanks to this mirror finish in
fact you can't even tell the SSD is RGB
capable when the lights are disabled
that's how well the feature has been
integrated so it's well suited to many
different types of builds of course the
main SSD inside is just your basic sight
a unit based on 3d NAND with 560
megabytes per second reads and 510
megabytes per second right so the main
reason you'd get something like this is
for the visual design and also because
they tend to be quite cheap although I
don't have any firm word on pricing team
group tells me it should be available in
the third quarter around the August to
September timeframe if everything goes
to plan in other SSD news we have the
company's new cardia cardia I'm not
quite sure how you pronounce that word
let's go with car day--is 0 m2 PCIe nvme
SSDs these are available in two versions
one with AP
CIE 3.00 times for interface and the
other with PCIe 4.0 times for so for
those building third gen rising systems
with an x5 70 motherboard you want to
get one of these PCIe 4.0 drives because
they are actually faster than the pcie
3.0 model 3.8 gigabytes per second reads
and 3.2 gigabytes per second rights with
the PSA 4 version compared with 3.4
gigabytes per second reads and 3
gigabyte per second writes for the pc a3
version it'll be available in 256
gigabyte 512 gigabyte and 1 terabyte
capacities I'm sure Steve will be trying
to get a bunch of these into tests with
new rice and processes and it's good to
see another company looking to take
advantage of PCIe 4 pointer as soon as
the interface is ready for use don't
have many other details such as pricing
or release date but it's well beyond the
concept stage as the PCIe 4.0 Drive does
already have a name it's Z 440 to
distinguish it from these set of 340
pcie 3.0 models but wait there's more
SSD news and this one will again
interest PC builders looking for
something visually interesting
what we have is the cardia of liquid
which i've got to say is a pretty unique
concept it's basically a liquid cooling
chamber for an m2 SSD it attaches to the
SSD via a thermal pad and transfers its
heat into whatever liquid solution you
pour into the drive you can either use
the included liquid in a variety of
colors or use your own perhaps to match
the rest of your custom liquid cooling
rig while the drive is sort of liquid
cooled it doesn't hook up to the rest of
a custom loop it's just a standalone
item the pour hole is accessible via a
sliding cover and team group tells me
the liquor inside should be replaced
every six months or so in terms of
cooling performance we're looking at up
to a 10 degree reduction when the drive
is active compared to not having a
cooler on your SSD although I'll leave
Steve to test that when the drives are
available soon personally I'm not sure
what the cooling capabilities will end
up as but it could be useful for the new
super fast psi 4.0 models to me this is
more of a visual thing it looks awesome
in builds and should be great for those
that want to match their MDOT to SSD to
the rest of the liquid cooling gear in
their system reckon we'll see this in a
lot of custom builds for those buying
team group RGB SSDs and other RGB
equipment we have the T force captain
RGB control box
fairly
straightforward it allows you to attach
multiple RGB devices to to easily sync
up lighting effects and provide more RGB
ports than you might have on your
motherboard it has a button in the
middle for cycling through some built-in
effects and one of team's new T force a
RGB addressable LED strips is included
in the box bringing independent control
of every LED in this trip and it's
magnetic
continuing on the RGB theme team group
were also showing off some of their new
RGB ddr4 modules with a RGB LED so
similar deal to the strip and that each
LED is addressable for better effect
controls while a RGB LEDs are coming to
teams other products like Delta Z and
excalibur memory the big product on show
was the top-of-the-line extreme a RGB
memory and boy does it look awesome with
a mirror finish on the heat spreader
similar to the new Delta Max RGB SSD so
you can either opt for massively
in-your-face RGB effects or a more
subtle look depending on the build you
want so that's really cool in my opinion
again catering to all sorts of builders
and of course this memory is available
at speeds up to forty eight hundred
megahertz like with the rest of their
extreme memory as for other stuff on
show we had T forces dark Z ddr4 j-- is
their new high-end gaming kits available
in speeds up to thirty six hundred
megahertz really awesome heat spreader
on this one with 0.8 millimeter thick
aluminium alloy then finally perhaps not
the most crazy thing for gamers but I
did spot some interesting utility USB
flash drives one had a bottle opener and
a box cutter on it another had a ruler
and magnifying glass kind of a neat
concept for something that doesn't get a
lot of attention usually oh and Steve
took this cool b-roll for team groups
new portable SSD offering that is water
and dust proof figured I should probably
use this footage because it looks pretty
good well that's it for Team Group at
Computex 2019 I think there's a lot of
products on show at this booth that will
please those that are PC builders and
love that are GB SSD action and also RGB
memory but of course it's really great
to see team group also catering to those
that don't necessarily want the RGB
effects so they've got new memory and
SSDs as well that don't have that which
yeah it's great to see so yeah as always
you can subscribe for the rest of our
Computex 2019 coverage don't forget to
like this video if you enjoyed it thanks
to Steve the cameraman
who is struggling maybe maybe not
struggling doing alright with my crazy
camera set that I've got here and I'll
catch you in the next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
