headsets going around and if I'm honest
the cabling on my headset is the most
annoying of the lot I couldn't care less
about having a wireless keyboard as it
never moves and I happily use a wired
mouse to the cable of my headsets
constantly in the way today I'm taking a
look at raises new solution to all my
life's problems the mantel wall as
always this is another Razer product
with a good-looking design I think
they're good-looking anyway and if you
don't like the way these look then you
probably hate all of razor's products
the headset is black all around with a
simple inclusion of razor's logo on the
side of the ear cards which are really
quite massive and chunky in a good way I
say in a good way because this means
they're big enough to fit around my ears
and they're full of super comfy padding
that's wrapped in a nice soft leather
ette there's a nice thick headband too
which does a good job of spreading the
way evenly over your head and is easily
adjusted for different head sizes with a
standard slide on either side quality
hinges at the end allow a 90 degree
swivel which I find super handy for
placing the headset down on my desk and
also for hanging around my neck
comfortably the mic is retractable too
and slides back to the right ear card
when not in use there's volume wheels on
both sides too on the right hand side
you can mute and adjust the mic pick up
volume and on the left side you can
adjust the headsets volume the mic
features an LED indicator that lights up
when it's muted - which should help
prevent you from having accidental long
conversations with yourself very cool
indeed very cleverly behind the mic
volume wheel is the pop-out dongle which
plugs into your PC or console via USB
the range and wireless performance of
this headset was truly excellent and I
could walk two rooms away with the mom
without interrupted music those the have
issues though razer has included USB
extension for the receiver - which
itself has a pretty cool design the
implementation of RGB lighting on the
Manowar is impressive - the razer logos
on the ear cups light up and you've got
sixteen point eight million colors to
choose from as per usual within the
razer synapse software you can choose
from a few different standard lighting
effects also I found the Manowar super
comfortable thanks to the lightweight
and excellent padding I expected a
wireless headset with a supposed seven
day battery to be a bit weighty but it's
they weigh just 375 grams which isn't
even bad for a wired headset as the
headset interfaces digitally we get the
inclusion of virtual 7.1 surround sound
and I was impressed with the quality and
directional sense I got these headphones
offer a pretty wide soundstage which
really helped in this department too the
drivers are fifty millimeters with
neodymium magnets and they offered sound
that was easily good enough for gaming
and sounded good for music and movies
too
all sound ranges were satisfactory and I
didn't notice any real strengths or
weaknesses the battery is advertised to
last 14 hours and you can gain an
additional 6 hours by turning off the
IDB light which I did immediately since
I didn't get to see them and no one's
watching me game here's a mic test for
those interested too it sounds quite
good and will definitely suit in-game
chat and Skype Razer synapse software of
course accompanies the Man O'War and
here you can customize the lining is
mentioned fine-tune surround sound
customize the audio with an equalizer
and apply quick effects such as bass
boost and voice clarity you can also set
profiles for different apps too which is
a useful touch
lastly you can enable volume
normalization and ambient noise
reduction on the mark which are both
handy especially if you're chatting in
loud environments all up the razor
Manowar is a really great wireless
headset first of all the sound and
comfortable in and I view this is the
most important factors excellent
features like RGB lighting are there too
for those that like it and the dual
volume wheels are handy also I like that
a charge is simply through the standard
microUSB and razer synapse software as
great as always it's only a shame that
there's no analog connector for
smartphones or other devices the don't
feature USB otherwise these could be
arguably the best gaming headset going
around if you don't mind the chunky
design and a 170 US dollar or 240
Australian dollar price tag these could
certainly be the wireless headset for
you what do you guys think do you know
of any other awesome wireless headsets
