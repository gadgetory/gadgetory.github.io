box today I've got for you a video on a
laptop that I've been waiting to get my
hands on for a couple of months now it
is the gorgeous razor blade 2017 this
guy's kitted out with all the way to
starred where an Intel Core i7 7700 HQ
processor and video geforce gtx 1060
graphics and of course you get that
excellent slim and light aluminium
unibody chassis it's a really fantastic
product ii and one of my most highly
recommended gaming laptops at the moment
the hardware movi unit packs no
surprises as I mentioned earlier we're
looking at the i7 7700 HQ and also the
GTX 1066 gigabyte but we're also seeing
16 gigabytes of ddr4 and a 256 gigabyte
SSD inside SSD of course being the
primary piece of hardware you can
configure in this laptop along with this
display we're looking at a 14 inch 1080p
display on this particular model you can
configure that up to 4k if you choose
before I dive too deep into the hardware
and performance of this laptop let's
take a look at the design because this
is without a doubt my favorite gaming
laptop chassis on the market at the
moment the aluminium unibody design
curves seamlessly around the edges to
create a premium look and feel one of my
favorite aspects here is the lack of
game style elements this is a minimalist
and understanded design it looks
fantastic you can use it in office
settings with no trouble whatsoever and
really the only thing that could come
close to being a game element is the
acid green Razer logo on the lid but
even then I think that looks pretty
decent and in general the Razer pres
design well it's definitely the best
design on the market as far as gaming
laptops are concerned part of the
reasons why this design is so successful
is that it's both slim and light at just
one point eight six kilograms heavy for
the 1080p model and seventeen point nine
millimeters thin you can easily take
this laptop around with you on the go
despite the fact that it's got a
quad-core CPU and a GTX 1060 inside it's
the perfect mix of Portability and power
in my opinion and well it just adds to
the feature set that makes this design
so compelling razer has chosen and
a perfect array of i/o on this laptop
everyday users we're seeing three USB
3.0 type-a ports complemented by a
thunderbolt for a USB type-c port also
seeing a full-sized HDMI 2.0 port and a
3.5 mm audio jack perhaps the main
permission here is no internet although
this laptop is too thin to actually fit
nice an airport in it and no SD card
slot perhaps a slight a mission here
would have liked to see one of those
included on the blade but nonetheless
Thunderbolt 3 is not a feature that you
see on every single gaming laptop so
it's great to see Rosa has included it
here the keyboard on the razor blade is
well suited to gaming thanks to its
light actuation force and reasonably
good tactile feedback despite its short
travel distance
I think the layout here is very good
except for the truncated arrow keys and
in general you'll have no problems
typing or gaming on this laptop and of
course it's fully RGB backlit as you'd
expect from a razer prodigy and
super-tender Razer synapse and configure
this as you would with any other Razer
peripheral there's plenty of RGB options
in there and tons of awesome effects you
can include on this laptop there's
endless possibilities that you can do in
there I was also really impressed with
the trackpad on this laptop you wouldn't
necessarily want to use it for gaming
but just in general everyday use yeah it
tracks very solidly it has some nice
clicky buttons at the bottom dedicated
buttons there and in general I really
can't complain about the trackpad
experience or the keyboard that's
provided on flat top perhaps the weakest
aspect to the razor blade is its display
my review he was cleared out with a 14
inch 1080p IPS LCD with no touchscreen
you can configure that up to a 4k model
with the touch screen and you get all
the benefits of an IPS panel 300 tween
its peak brightness 1 to 70 to 1
contrast ratio and great viewing angles
but my main issue here is the color
performance out of the box as we jump
into spectra Cal Cal Man 5 and take a
look at some of the graphs we're only
seeing an average delta e value in
greyscale of just 7.6 which is
particularly bad and a saturation
average of 4 point 43 with a color
checker average of 5 point 4 7 are not
great results here for the razor blade
ideally you'd want to see
a value below 2.0 for casual use and
under 1.0 for professional use so it's
well beyond what I would consider an
accurate display and it's noticeably
tinted green out of the box which is a
bit surprising here so at least I guess
raises and in color is green so maybe
they thought that tint the display green
or whatever but you can calibrate that
out of the display oh and I wanna
display Pro to do that you can achieve
reasonably good results here and now
let's move on to the section that you
guys have all been waiting for the
performance as we're looking at a core
i7 7700 HQ and a geforce gtx 1060 GPU we
won't see results that differ too much
from some of the other gaming laptops
that i've reviewed but it's still a
pretty solid showing from the razor
blade across the board nonetheless with
no performance differences compared to
some of those other laptops with similar
specifications as we dive here into our
pc mark home workload again very decent
results here scoring 3213 around the
same range as some of our other laptops
with similar hardware and you'll see
similar result in our creative benchmark
here again this tends to be a bit GPU
limited so we're not seeing some of the
same scores as you'll get from gtx 1070
laptops or upwards and in the works core
you probably wanted to use the razor
blade for some productivity workloads
and it scores reasonably well at 4815 in
this particular test as we move on to
our encoding benchmarks Cinebench our
eleven point five again the razor blade
falls within the range of other i7 7700
HD processors in both the multi and
single threaded workloads and you'll see
very similar results moving to our x264
HD encoding benchmark does reasonably
well here scoring at around seventy nine
frames per second and pass one of us run
pretty typical results for the i7 7700
HQ and this makes it a very suitable
laptop for some video editing on the go
moving onto winrar and you'll see again
rose oil results here that put this
device in the same range as other
laptops with similar hardware this
benchmark can be a little bit memory
bandwidth limited but we're looking at a
dual channel system here so no issues in
terms of its performance and for those
engineers out there that want to be
using MATLAB
our 2016 for some simulations and so
forth again a very solid showing from
the razor blade here compared to some of
the other laptops on the market with
this sort of hardware and again you know
it's a pretty portable laptop so it's
improved showings across our
productivity workloads is a very solid
result here moving on to 3d marks times
by workload just to make sure the GTX
1060 is working as expected and well it
is it's approximately 29% slower than
the GTX 1070 in some GPU limited tests
however for those of you upgrade from a
gtx 970m you can expect to see 44% more
performance in the GPU limited workload
so a pretty decent showing from the GTX
260 and it's pretty good to see a laptop
with this sort of power in this sort of
bomb factor moving on to some of our
gaming results now we'll start with the
older titles like tomb Raider's ultimate
preset at 1080p 55 frames per second
average with a 1% load of forty-one FPS
makes this very playable on the GTX 1060
inside this laptop Microlife slides very
high preset 77 FPS average with a 1% low
of 53 fps so you can basically crank the
settings up all the way in this title
taking a look at BioShock Infinite we've
got an average frame rate here of over
100 FPS exactly what we want to see and
a 1% low of 49 fps a bit low here in
BioShock Infinite that's pretty typical
of the test that we're looking at Middle
Earth shadow of Mordor again we're
seeing fantastic results here an average
frame rate of 87 FPS at 1% low of 62 FPS
so a very smooth experience in this
title in Grand Theft Auto 5 at maximum
settings we're seeing an average frame
rate of 57 FPS with a 1% low of 40 fps
you can change the scenes down to high
to achieve an average well above 60 fps
but I think the gaming experience
provided by the max settings are still
pretty decent on the razorblade also
take a look at rise of the Tomb Raider
the most intensive title in this
benchmark suite unfortunately you can't
play it on maximum settings on the gtx
1060 and average frame rate of under 30
FPS just isn't an acceptable experience
but if you take the settings down to
high at 1080p
you'll be cranking that average up to 64
FPS with a 1% low of 44 FPS so very
playable experience I'll bet add some
slightly reduced quality settings Deus
Ex mankind divided a pretty decent game
here at Ultra quality things we're
seeing an average frame rate of 39 FPS
on the GTX 1060 with a 1% low of 32 FPS
so cutting it a little bit fine but
again if you bring the settings down too
high you will see your framerate jump up
to 54 FPS with a 43 fps 1% low so pretty
decent there so across the board here
the Razer Blade II is a very capable
gaming laptop with the GTX 1060 inside
it's well suited to 1080p gaming at
around the very high to ultra quality
presets with frame rates around the
60fps marking some of the more recent
tiles you might need to crack down
things just a little bit to hit that
frame rate target that you're after but
in general the GTX 1060 this sort of
form factor is a really compelling
option for gamers I want something
portable that they can take around with
them wherever they are while we are
seeing some very solid gaming
performance results here there is one
thing to note and that is the razor
blade runs very hot and very loud if you
don't have a good pair of headphones you
will be able to hear the high pitch and
loud fan whine from the blade over your
in-game audio it is one of the loudest
gaming laptops that I've reviewed and it
runs very hot in AI 264th stability test
we will see 95 degrees C on the CPU and
89 degrees C on the GPU and the metal
unibody chassis is quite hot to touch in
some of these situations if you're
running a game like watchdogs to the
temperatures are a bit better 81 degrees
C on the CPU and 80 degrees C on the GPU
but again some gaming laptops do have
better cooling solutions that run
quieter and cooler the razor blade has
certainly traded off its cooling
solution for its excellent form factor
that's just something you have to
consider when purchasing this laptop one
aspect that I was more impressed with
though is the battery life from this
laptop and this surprised me considering
the quad-core CPU inside and the GTX
1060 it's a 70 watt hour cell and
take a look at some of our battery
benchmarks here it performs very similar
to a mid tier ultrabook and that's
exactly what you want to see from a
portable laptop like this achieving over
seven hours in our video playback test
is a fantastic result and achieving
nearly six hours in our Wi-Fi browsing
test is very similar to some of the
ultrabooks that I've been taking a look
at recently like the HP spectre x360 so
what we've seen from the razorblade so
far is a fantastic aluminium unibody
chassis a great keyboard and trackpad
with RGB backlighting we're also seeing
a decent display not too well calibrated
out of the box that can be fixed if you
have a calibration tool and great
performance and battery life across a
wide range of benchmarks so the one
thing that will prevent you from
purchasing the Razer Blade is its price
at 1900 US dollars for the 256 gigabyte
model it is a very expensive laptop and
to be honest I think you want at least
512 gigabytes of SSD space to make this
laptop really worth it for your everyday
usage and that will bring the cost up to
two thousand one hundred US dollars well
above the price of other laptops with
similar hardware inside for those of you
in Australia wanting to know how much is
costing dollar readers we're looking at
two thousand eight hundred dollars for
the base model and three thousand one
hundred for the 512 gigabyte model so
again whether you're in Australia or the
United States is a very expensive laptop
but I think if you want the highest
quality gaming laptop on the market
perhaps the best on the market at the
moment you will have to pay for the
quality and that's simply the case with
the Razer Blade it's a quality laptop
but it will certainly cost you a bit to
buy it anyway that's it for this review
