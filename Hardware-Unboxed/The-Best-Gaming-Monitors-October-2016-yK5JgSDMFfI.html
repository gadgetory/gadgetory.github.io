episode this time we'll be taking a look
at the heap of gaming monitors monitors
are something i haven't so much
so I thought that ought to change
initially I plan to pick out one or two
exceptional value monitors and call it a
day unfortunately monitor shopping is no
simple task and my research took me on a
long and winding journey that at one
point I fear may never end with major
online retailers such as newegg stocky
over 1,000 monitors picking the right
one can be a daunting task picking your
starting point helps probably the best
place to start as price of course things
such as monitor size panel type
resolution and refresh rate of great
importance to and then there are
features such as free sync g-sync and
more to consider I've managed to break
all this down into three categories for
this video so hopefully I have something
that'll suit your needs I'll put
together a part two as well which will
focus on G sinker precinct monitors as
well as 4k gaming that being said let's
get into it first we'll look at the best
value budget peaks for this category I
narrow down the field to two options the
ACS ve 24 7 h and the benq GL 24-6 ehm
which both costs roughly the same amount
and both similar specifications both
free to TN panels making them ideal for
gaming given the quick to millisecond
greater grey response times although
both a 1080p displays the benq is
slightly larger 24 inches versus
twenty-three point six inches though the
difference is negligible image quality
wise the asuste panel is slightly better
in boast greater brightness that coupled
with the included stereo speakers makes
the v 20 47 age the top pick for me but
both a great value options not
interested in an affordable monitor all
right well let's check out the big boys
my editing video used the wp 32 16 q 32
inch but it's a little pricing i feel
there are better options for gamers the
acer predator x 34 and asu's rog swift
PG 34 8q come to mind these widescreen
curved monitors the kingpins of the
gaming world right now and they're very
similar products in fact in many ways
they're the same product they both use
the same 34 inch ultra wired curved IPS
panel boasting a massive 34 40 x 1440
resolution
they both support in videos g-sync
technology and the same overclocked 100
makers refresh rate in the end both are
exceptional monitors in picking between
them will come down to pricing in your
region or whichever company you prefer
if you're after a 4k monitor then I
highly recommend the del u P 3216 q 32
inch or the more affordable acer
predator XP 32 1 HK again both your
exceptional monitors with amazing image
quality ok so we've looked at affordable
monitors and ultra expensive monitors
now what about something in between
these are my general best gaming monitor
pics they're both priced under a
thousand us and again this is another a
service as a sous battle my
recommendation here is it a CX b27 0h
you or the acs pd 27 9 q both costs
roughly the same amount in the US though
the acer model appears to be much
cheaper in australia making the obvious
choice for z's both monitors are again
very similar featuring 27 inch IPS
panels supporting 2560 x 1440 with
invidious g-sync technology other specs
such as the refresh rate response time
brightness and contrast ratio are all
the same as well well I hope this has
helped you guys looking for a new
monitor to narrow down the options there
are definitely some nice 24 inch
displays containing for the best budget
gaming monitor these days for those that
can afford one of the no compromise
model options you surely won't be
disappointed the compromise for the more
affordable best game in one of the
category isn't huge and we narrowed it
down to a few nice 27 inch displays of
course there are more price ranges to
cover as well as features so I'll be
creating a part 2 video soon curring 4k
gaming monitors g-sync free sync and
more if you guys like this content then

do my best update them regularly let me
