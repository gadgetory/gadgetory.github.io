then welcome back to harbor unbox today
due to popular demand we're Reeb inch
marking the core i7 5820k to see how it
performs to more modern processes I
managed to grab one of these online for
what equates to about $200 us and that
seems to be about the going price right
now so just quickly a big thank you to
all our patrons supporters who make it
possible for us to buy hardware like
this for testing purposes for those of
you unaware the 5820k was first released
back in August of 2014 for what was a
rather reasonable $390 us at the time as
the cheapest haswell-e processor at pax
6 cores and thanks to hyper-threading
support often twelve threads by default
it worked at a base frequency of 3.3
gigahertz but depending on the workload
would boost as high as 3.6 ago hertz
though admittedly that's a pretty mild
increase in total at PAX 15 megabytes of
l3 cache and one and a half megabytes of
l2 cache and this was a significant
increase over the main stream core i7
range although pin compatible with the
previous generations ivy bridge-e and
sandy bridge-e we've still got an
upgraded socket LGA 2011 version 3 that
said though the socket change was
somewhat justified this time as the
haswell-e processors saw the adoption of
ddr4 memory on intel's high-end desktop
platform as was the case with the
previous generations quad-channel memory
support remained and the official spec
called for ddr4 2133 since the release
of the 5820k we've seen these 6800 cade
which checked the price up to four
hundred and thirty four dollars u.s. and
then of course last year we've got this
7800 ex which went back down to three
hundred and ninety dollars us last year
we also got the rise in five 1600 which
is new
been discounted to less than $200 us and
then the eighth course sixteen threat r7
1700 which has also been recently
discounted and now can be had for less
than $300 us what this means is Intel's
high-end desktop platform actually face
some real competition in 2017 not
something it's really ever seen as is
often the case our testing will be
focused on gaming but we do plan to look
at this from two different perspectives
firstly we want to show those of you
that are currently using a 5820k if
there's any advantage to upgrading to a
more modern processor if you're mostly
gaming is the 87 or EK worth jumping
ship for or should your wait give them
what we did recently see when testing
the has wall base 4770k the answer at
this point should be pretty clear and
that is just to wait clock for clock at
4.8 gigahertz the 4770k was just 15
percent slower at 1080p using the medium
quality type settings with the geforce
gtx 1080i using the maximum quality
preset reduce that margin adjust 10
percent and when increasing the GPU
workload 1440p the margin was again
reduced fair that's just 4% so that
being the case I really don't expect to
find much difference with the 5820k but
still you guys seem to love benchmark
results and well so do I so let's not
let that little facts stop or shall we
moving on the other goal is to provide
second-hand shoppers with valuable
information on whether the 5820k and an
accompanying x99 motherboard are worth
snapping up at around $200 u.s. the
5820k is an attractive option and
supporting boards they seem to be
selling for around 80 to $100 us for
testing of paired the 5820k with quad
channel ddr4 2666 memory that's actually
the highest memory speed the processor
would work with at least with the memory
that I had available for testing then we
have the 4770k and that was tested using
ddr3 2400 memory and the 8700 K was
tested with ddr4 3,200 memory before we
jump into the gamey results I've
included some Cinebench r15 scores along
with some Corona benchmark results and
some power consumption figures as well
first up a quick look at everyone's
favorite rendering benchmark Cinebench
r15 here these stock 50
20 K scored six percent lower than that
of the r5 1600 the rise in CPU also
posted a better single thread result as
well still overall they weren't
drastically different then once I
overclocked the 5820k hit thirteen
hundred and five points and that placed
a ton polity stocks every 100 X and I
walking 21 percent behind the
overclocked 8700 K so if you're wanting
to increase your productivity
performance the 8700 K will offer
noticeable gains though you probably
better off with a scalar X processor
such as the 78 20x or perhaps even the
horizon 7 CPU here's a look at the
corona results and here we see at the
5820k is again only able to match the
700 X once overclocked that said though
in this test it does pull well ahead of
the risin 5 1600 and almost catches the
r7 1700 still even overclocked the 5820k
was 10% slower than the stock 87 ok and
24 percent slower once the 8th gen
processor was overclocked lastly before
jumping into the gaming results use a
quick look at power consumption stock
the 5820k consumes slightly more power
than the 8700 K as well as the 12 core
24 thread thread ribbon 1920 X but also
less than the 7800 X overclocked it
sucked down these same 270 watts as the
5.2 gigahertz 87 and okay so not extreme
but still at 4.6 gigahertz the 5820k
starts to get quite power-hungry
alright time for the games and kick
starting things is ashes of the
benchmark a favorite for testing CPU
performance starting with the higher
quality settings at 1080p using the gtx
1080i we see the 5820k is very
respectable roughly matching the highly
clocked of 7700 K that said it was up to
16 percent sold nearly 700 K
overclocking did help close the gap and
now it's really only the 1% low figure
where the higher clocked 87 ok holds an
advantage going crazy with the quality
setting certainly closes the gap right
up and now the overclocked 5820k is on
par with the rest of the 8th gen core
processors due to a heavy GPU bottleneck
that said though the stock 1 percent low
figure for the 5820k
did drop down to just 69 FPS
then at 1440p as expected the GPU
bottleneck grows even more extreme and
now even the stock 5820k doesn't really
trail that far behind for the 1% low
result Assassin's Creed origins is
another very CPU demanding game but out
of the box the 5820k does reasonably
well despite being much slower than the
77 or okay and all of the 8th gen series
processors that said though overclocking
did boost the average frame rate by 16%
and that's a nice gain right there this
placed the overclocked 5820k
almost on par with the core i5 8400 for
the average frame rate that was still
slower for the minimum frame rate
increasing the quality preset to
ultra-high closes down the margin and
now the overclocked 5820k is just 7%
slower than the fastest CPUs tested and
comparing the minimum frame rate here we
see that the margin remains pretty much
the same even at 1440p and while the
overclocked 5820k was able to match the
overclocked 4770k and the 7700 k it did
trail the 8700 k still overall strong
performance from the aging six core CPU
next up we have battlefield one and
using the medium quality preset at 1080p
really gives the GTX 1080 Ti room to
breathe overclocking the 5820k boosted
the average frame rate by 13% and this
places on par with the stock 7700 K so a
decent result and it meant that we saw a
frame rates in excess of 120 FPS at all
times
now with the ultra preset enabled the
overclocked 5820k is able to roughly
match the core i5 86 under ok and it
really only slips behind slightly for
the 1% lower result then we see
something quite interesting when moving
to the 1440p resolution here the
overclocked 5820k falls behind the 4770k
and Core i5 8400 when comparing the
average frame rate though the minimum is
still very strong and here were just 10%
slower than the overclocked 8700 K
though admittedly were also quite GPU
bound moving on we have some Call of
Duty World War 2 action and here we see
when using the normal quality settings
that the 5820k does quite well even
before it's overclocked then once we
round up to 4.6 gigahertz it's able to
match the core i5 8400 with an
impressive average frame rate of 2
FPS and that's just 10% slower than the
core i7 8700 k at 4.8 gigahertz
interestingly the margin actually grows
with the extra quality settings in play
and now the overclocked 5820k is 14%
slower than the overclocked 8700 k that
said though that's certainly not a
significant margin particularly given
the 5820k is pushing well over 110 FPS
at all times
then at 1440p we only see a very slight
reduction in performance is even here we
seem to be more cpu than GPU limited the
5820k remains a little over 10% slower
than the 8700 k and here we do see a 13%
margin the second last game we're going
to be looking at is project cows - and
here we are again starting with the
medium quality settings it's area P here
we do find something rather unexpected
the overclocked 5820k is able to max out
the gtx 1080i and therefore match the
overclocked 87 or okay this is
interesting because as you're about to
see in a moment the ultra quality
settings seem to our impact cpu
performance so let's have a look at that
so as you can see here with the ultra
quality settings enabled at 1080p the
overclocked 5820k drops right down and
in fact isn't much faster than its stock
out of the box configuration the
overclocked 87 or okay though that
remains strong in heavy 5820k was 16%
slower then finally at 1440p were now
heavily GPU limited and as a result all
test configurations come together with
very little variation between the CPUs
the last game tested is Rainbow six
siege and here we see a nice 18 percent
performance boost for the 5820k once
overclocked this meant using the medium
quality settings it was twelve percent
slower than the overclocked 87 okay and
with well over 180 FPS at all times
that's clearly a very good result for
the older six core Intel CPU now with
the ultra quality settings the gtx 1080i
starts to limit performance of the
overclocked 37 or ok and as a result the
5820k is now just nine percent slower
again we only saw a frame dips to 150
FPS so an extremely smooth experience
can be had with the 5820k in this title
then as we often find at 1440p even with
an extreme GPU we're still mostly
limited by the graphics card and here
the 5820k is just 5% slower
nearly 700 K so if you're playing at the
1440p resolution or greater you're not
really going to notice a difference
right so if you're still rocking a core
i7 5820k do you need to upgrade well in
short no that's pretty much we set at
the start of the video based on testing
recently done so for those of you that
follow the channel closely that won't be
much of a shocker for gaming the gains
simply aren't there but we will take a
closer look at an average across all the
games tested in a moment to get a really
clear picture of what's going on there
but let's move away from gaming just for
a moment and talk about productivity
workloads so if you've overclocked your
5820k through the max and you still find
that it's not getting the job done quick
enough then yes an upgrade can certainly
help reduce workload times for these
productivity type workloads the
overclocked 87 or okay well it's 20 to
30 percent faster so whether that's
worth buying a new CPU motherboard and
potentially higher clock ddr4 memory
well that'll be for you to decide
the Rison 7 1700 is also $100 cheaper
than the 87 are ok and for mostly
productivity workloads it is as fast or
faster with both CPUs overclocked that
said there are certainly applications
that still favor the Intel CPU so be
aware of that and make sure you research
how they CPUs compare in the
applications that you'll be using
if gaming is the focus and application
performance is more of a secondary
demand then right now Intel is the best
option at least for flat out gaming
performance of the latest and greatest
GPUs here's a look at the average
performance seen across the six games
tested the 5820k was just 10% slower in
that scene we're using an extreme GPU
with Mal quality settings that's
certainly not a big margin and I can't
imagine anyone would ditch their 5820k
for that kind of game under slightly
more realistic conditions we see just a
6 percent decline in performance when
using the 5820k
a poche 7 ok and you can expect that
margin to at least half again when going
to 4k if not evaporate entirely so it's
not worth upgrading it from the 5820k
derp anything newer for gaming of that
much we've pretty well established now
productivity is a little more
tricky but that really comes down to how
much money you're willing to invest to
reduce downtime and by going for
something like Daddy 700 K you can
reduce it by twenty to thirty percent
but it is quite a large cost to get that
twenty or thirty percent and because of
that I really feel if you are going to
upgrade for productivity reasons and say
you really are best off with eight or
more cause to receive any sort of
noteworthy upgrade it really is a
complicated buying decision and while
some people like to try and simplify it
with I suppose their own personal bias
by saying Intel is better or AMD is
better the truth really is far more
complex than that anyway let's not get
bogged down and all that we'll just move
right along to second-hand shoppers what
should they do well to answer this one
we're going to have to assume a few
things here but we're going to do so
while remaining within the realm of
realism by this I mean we're going to
assume that the typical asking price for
a core i7 5820k and x99 motherboard
combo is between 250 and 300 dollars us
and not quote some absurdly low price
you're likely never going to find I'm
not going to worry about ddr4 memory
because that's gonna be mandatory for
any of these upgrades whether that be a
secondhand 5820k or a new hn core
processor or perhaps even a rise in cpu
considering the 87 RK plus a basic z3 70
board will set you back 500 dollars that
makes the 5820k option at least 40%
cheaper it's a big saving right there
especially given the performance
difference for gamers is well negligible
of course secondhand Hardware comes with
obvious drawbacks such as a lack of a
warranty for example still 40% is a
massive saving another alternative would
be the risin 7 1700 which when coupled
with a decent be 350 board that can
support a 4 gigahertz overclock should
the CPU be good for that that'll cost
just 360 dollars that means you'd be
saving at most $100 when going for the
second-hand option and realistically
it's probably going to be less than that
and while gaming your performance will
be as good or potentially even better
with the 5820k many productivity
workloads will be boosted with the
horizon 7 CPU you also get a warranty
with brand-new parts so that's
certainly well worth mentioning so for
those reasons I think I would shy away
from the second-hand market for this
kind of purchase additionally there's
also these security issues that come
with the older Intel hardware and we're
not 100% sure when CPUs such as the
5820k or receive the required BIOS
update or perhaps rather I should say
these supporting x99 motherboards will
receive BIOS updates
I believe companies such as MSI did just
roll out BIOS updates that do address
the x99 motherboards so that may not be
an issue you may be able to mitigate
those security issues with that BIOS
update but remember doing so will come
and around a three to five percent
performance in games so definitely
something worth noting in short if
you're a gamer and you already have a
5820k well just keep it for now if
you're looking to buy one secondhand
then I suggest getting something cheaper
like a Haswell core i7 4770k or a 4790k
unless you're getting the 5820k with
motherboard front of $250 US I really
don't think I'd bother there's also a
md's recent rise and price cuts that are
worth taking into account because they
make products such as the r5 1600 or the
r7 1700 mighty tempting but even then it
might pay to hold out for a few more
months and see what the rise and refresh
brings and well that might either knock
down the prices of the processes we
currently have further or there might be
some better options available for people
looking at building new systems anyway
