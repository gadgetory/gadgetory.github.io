finally benchmarking Metro Exodus and in
case you were worried that I was
starting to get lazy on you guys there
is a good reason for why we're late to
the party now the game was only released
last week so four days ago now but we
were given a review code a few days
prior to release so we've had access for
quite some time now a bit longer than we
normally would but we're still yet to
publish our big GPU benchmark
however Tim decided to quickly check out
ray-tracing and DL SS performance and
after publishing that video we caught
wind that there would be a day one patch
which claimed to improve performance
also along with the game's release
aimday nvidia pushed our updated drivers
so we felt it was just best to wait i
only briefly tested the previous display
drivers from each company but as far as
I can tell the updated drivers made no
real performance improvements what did
improve performance was the day one
patch so our results might differ a bit
from those published earlier actually
I've taken a look at results published
by the usual suspects and some have
shown much higher frame rates thus while
others have shown slightly lower
I believe those showing slightly lower
results of tested in similar demanding
sections of the game but have done so
pre patch while though showing much
higher frame rates have made the mistake
of testing areas that aren't very
demanding generally performance does
fluctuate quite a bit in games depending
on what's being rendered though
developers do try to optimize levels for
more consistent performance now I
wouldn't say they've done a poor job of
this with Metro Exodus but you will see
frame rates with say a GTX 1060 at 1080p
as high as 70 to 80 fps in some areas
and then just 30 to 40 fps and others so
picking where your test is really
important probably more so than usual
helping me pick a good spot for testing
Tim recommended a demanding section
that's early on in the game he's played
much further and found other demanding
sections but believes this one is very
representative of how demanding the game
can get and with it being early on in
the game I don't have to invest hours
playing because we all know I'd rather
be benchmarking so this means we've
canned the canned benchmark in favor of
an in-game 60-second pass the benchmark
takes place in Moscow
it's very early on in the campaign it
takes place after a mutated pack of
wolves runs past for testing I'm using
the ultra preset which sees invidious
hair works and advanced physics disabled
by default tessellation though is
enabled the game also supports both
DirectX 11 and DirectX 12 api's but
performance using a kora 919 or a cane
was identical using either API so that
being the case we've decided to go with
DX 12 for benchmarking our standard GPU
test rig was used built inside the
corsair crystal 570 X that packs the
core I $9.99 oh okay clocked at 5 gear
guts with 32 gigabytes of vengence ddr4
3400 memory the latest AMD and NVIDIA
display drivers were installed for AMD
that was their adrenaline 2019 Edition
nineteen point two point two and for
NVIDIA their geforce for 1891 drivers I
think it's about everything you need to
know let's jump into the results since
we have 36 different GPUs here I've
created a scrolling graph so let's start
at the top and then work our way down as
you can see the r-tx 20 ATT I had no
issues keeping things above 100 FPS and
while 131 FPS at 1080p isn't amazing for
this extreme high end GPU it's better
than what I've seen in titles such as
Assassin's Creed Odyssey just cause for
hitman 2 and Kingdom Come deliverance
for example moving down the list we see
the Archie X 2080 delivering very solid
performance here it was 13% faster the
GTX 1080i so this title appears well
optimized for videos nuturing
architecture that said the 1080 TI still
does well and it seemed beating the much
newer Radeon seven men while the RT X 27
and 2060 offer very similar performance
and both were faster than not just Vega
64 liquid but also the GTX 1080 for
those hoping for around 60 FPS at AEP
you will require some pretty heavy GPU
firepower at the very least to GTX 1070
or Vega 56 will be required a Vega 56
was the faster of the two as roughly
matched the gtx 1070 TI then for around
50 FPS on average the Radeon rx 590 or
GeForce GTX 1060 will work and here we
see the gtx 1066 EG bite is 9% fast in
the RX 580 and 14% faster than the 3
gigabyte 1060 then anything below the RX
5
r9 390 I deemed too slow for an
enjoyable experience
this meant the weakest in video GP you'd
want to play with is the GeForce GTX 970
so like I said the game demands some
serious harbor at 1080p when using the
ultra quality preset which isn't the
highest quality preset available that
would be extreme and for those of you
wondering I will explore performance
with lower quality presets a bit later
on the video but for now let's check out
how the game plays at 1440p with the
ultra quality setting ok so again
starting with the RDX 2080 ti we see
that the average frame rate remained
just over 100 FPS while the one percent
low drop down towards 90 fps
still that's pretty impressive given the
RT x 28 he couldn't even average 90 fps
and said it was good for you 3 FPS the
radio and 7 was 14% slot with 71 fps and
this meant it was just 8% faster than
the RT x 2070 and just 16% faster than
the RT X 2060 not great given it costs
twice as much the arch X 2060 is
actually really good value here it
matched the GT x 1080 and really wasn't
noticeably slower than 2070 Vega 64
liquid does okay but I think it's Vega
56 that's really the standout AMD option
here despite getting completely wasted
by the 2060 but it is of course in a
video sponsored title so probably no
surprises there in videos older Maxwell
GPUs are hanging in rather well that
980ti matched the gtx 1070 while the 980
matched the six gigabyte 1060 the six
year by 1060 was also 12% faster than
the rx 580 though neither were great at
1440p it has to be said averaging less
than 40 fps basically anything below the
RX 580 or GTX 970 were unplayable at
this resolution then at 4k well pretty
much good luck here you need 90 X 20
atti or you need to settle for inferior
quality settings at which point you
might as well bite the bullet and just
play at 1440p the game was playable
using a GTX 1080 or r-tx 2060 Radeon 7
or anything better but once you start
seeing 1% low performance dipping below
30fps
the stuttery frame rates really do harm
the experience now before wrapping
things up i retested 31 GPUs men
of them are not tested previously to see
if you can get away with older hardware
at 1080p using the medium quality
settings with tessellation disabled and
of course hair works and advanced
physics still turned off the medium
quality setting allowed the GTX 970
averaged 92 fps this is a massive 119
percent performance boost day for what
we saw if the ultra quality preset and
similar gains were also seeing with the
RX 5 70 + r9 390 the GTX 1050 t I saw a
doubling of framerate and this meant it
was now able to deliver highly playable
formance which was nice to see we also
see some old timers such as the HD 7970
and GTX 780 Ti offering playable
performance and boy oh boy has the 7970
aged well of course the r9 280x is a
rebadged 7970 with a factory overclock
and therefore we also see that
particular model topping the 780 Ti
meanwhile the slowest GPUs you'll get
away with include the r9 380 gtx 780 950
and the 1050 finally capping off the
testing we have some quality preset
scaling results we've just seen how the
medium quality preset offered a massive
performance uplift with the older GPUs
especially those with 4 gigabytes or
less vram the gains with the 8 gigabyte
rx5 80 and 60 gigabyte 1060 aren't as
extreme but even so we saw around a 50
to 60 percent performance boost when
dropping down to the medium quality
preset from ultra what's interesting
here is that the 580 in 10-6 deliver
basically identical performance with the
low and medium quality settings however
once we get to higher the 10 60 pulls a
few percent ahead and then extends that
margin further with the ultra preset if
there maintains its 9% lead with the
extreme quality settings tessellation
was enabled for all these tests while
hair works and advanced physics were
disabled
I suspect the level of tessellation is
increased with the ultra and extreme
settings and this hands in video a
slight advantage so for those of you
hoping to enjoy Metro Exodus and all of
its glory
are you're gonna need one hell of a
gaming rig to be fair though the game
does scale down quite well to
accommodate all the hardware so that was
nice to see and Tim will have a detailed
Metro Exodus graphical optimization
video for you guys tomorrow for now
though the quality preset scaling graph
will give you a good idea of
typical performance gains you can expect
to see when lower in the quality
settings for those of you with a sub
$300 GPU high quality appears to be a
good choice also if you have less than 4
gigabytes of vram then I strongly
suggest using the medium quality setting
at 1080p using the ultra quality setting
often saw a vm allocation reach around
3.8 gigabytes on cards with 6 to 8
gigabytes of memory and just over 4
gigabytes at 1440p and then almost 5
gigabytes at 4k also for those of you
wondering I did skip over any ray
tracing or DL SS testing as Tim's
covered that already Tim was also
reasonably impressed with ray tracing in
Metro far more so than battlefield 5
anyway where he believes that didn't
come close to justifying the performance
hit personally well I don't disagree
with Tim I wasn't that impressed and
really struggled to spot any differences
at all the performance it were I tested
was also more extreme than what Tim saw
whereas he observed a 29% performance
hit using the benchmark tool I saw a
more extreme 39% performance hit when in
game for me a roughly 40 percent
performance hit which saw the RT X 28
ETA at 1440 pedra for an average of 105
fps 265 fps it's just laughably bad
still I agree with Tim it's a better
implementation that we got with
battlefield 5 but that's really not
saying much finally it's also worth
noting the day one patch did improve
performance which is why we waited and
we would have certainly received a lot
more views on this content if we went
earlier but I felt you guys had probably
appreciate a more up-to-date benchmark
and I really didn't feel like testing
almost 60 different graphics cards twice
in the same week
overall the game looks great it's highly
detailed and this is obviously a large
reason for why it's so demanding but
both Amy and NVIDIA GPUs do perform very
well and although it is an Nvidia
sponsored title I feel like the radio
and GPUs did deliver excellent
performance I was most impressed with
the older Radeon GPUs such as the HD
7970 and that performed exceptionally
well when using the medium quality
setting anyway that is going to do it
for now be sure to keep an eye out for
Tim's optimization guide and they're
