another episode of unboxing boxes as
usual plenty of boxes and packages and
things to unbox so without wasting any
time let's get into it
I'm going to start with this box here
because this is a special little box and
it comes from a long time Harper unboxed
viewer so on the box here we have a cool
little sticker that says sky soldier
blades now sky soldier blades is owned
by Ted who is a as I said a long time
Harbor on box viewer Ted seems to enjoy
the unboxing boxes series and well more
importantly Ted is a paratrooper out of
the US Special Operations also US Army
Special Operations he's been in for
about six years now and that time he's
worked with some Aussie Special Forces
guys as well so that's pretty cool
and in fact it was a member of the
Australian Special Forces that
introduced Ted to Harbor unbox so that's
really cool and I'm honored to have
these guys watching the channel yeah
it's really blown away when Ted told me
that really really cool stuff any spare
time Ted founded his own company which
is sky soldier blades and as the name
suggests they're a bit of a the knife
specialists let's say and as such Ted
has no doubt been suffering through the
unboxing box a series as I struggle to
open boxes with my cheap multi-tool that
being the case he has generously offered
to send me some cool knives for quite
some time now so we recently got in
contact directly and I gave him my
address we discussed a few things and he
sent over a box of knives for unboxing
boxes so without wasting any more time I
think we should open this box and
hopefully I will be doing so with my
cheap crappy multi-tool for the last
time alright let's get into it and see
what Ted has sent me
very excited to see what's in here I
know it's some knives I just don't know
what sort of knives and full disclaimer
I am NOT a knife expert which is obvious
okay that's cool a Velcro a little label
that says don't bring a gun to a knife
fight very good I like that okay so we
have two boxes inside the shipping
package and one is for me and one is for
Tim we have a large knife apparently in
a well what still looks to be a rather
than at large knife okay so we've got a
neat little pouch here and this is a
Medford knife and I'm a knife noob I
don't know anything about knives but I
believe this is a pretty special knife
and you guys who know anything about
knives probably sitting there going wow
that's a pretty special knife so let's
see what we've got here wow this is
quite the upgrade
yikes okay so I'm gonna have to be
careful with this and definitely cut
away from myself not like what I was
doing with this thing yeah right so
apart from the fact that probably
shouldn't throw this around too much be
careful with it apart from the fact that
this is a folding knife from Medford I
can't really tell you too much about it
which is yeah a bit disappointing head
over to Ted's website I'll put a link
for this particular knife in the video
description I don't know how much it
costs but it seems like a very premium
knife alright so one of these is for me
and one of these is for Tim I pretty
much get to decide so we'll see what's
in this box here and this one is from
buck knives so we'll see what we got
neat little pouch fancy looking
Wow I feel like I probably have to be
more careful with this one
that's cool you guys can see the design
I'll provide some b-roll but that's
impressive
it looks really really cool and it's got
a little push button here that you push
and then the blade folds away and then
there's a button there
you obviously want your hands clear the
blade when you push that because it
flies out quite aggressively Wow now the
question is which one of these do I use
first open the next package well I
definitely have to fold them away in
between opening boxes and not leave the
blade out because I could lose a finger
so I just like to give a big thanks to
Ted for sending these knives out I now
have the difficult decision of picking
which one of these I want to keep and
which one I will give the Tim because
they're both very awesome also for those
of you interested I'll be sure to link
Ted's website in the video description
and yeah just a big thanks for
generously supplying these knives to
harbor unboxed for Tim and I to use
really appreciate it appreciate the heck
I even talk really appreciate that these
are just awesome and also just finally
as a PC enthusiast Ted now also builds
performance pcs so if you want a mean
gaming rig built by a real-life
paratrooper and head over to sky soldier
blades calm and they'll sort your way
out
all right moving on now it's time to
test these guys out I've actually got a
big package here from PC case key with
quite a few things that I want so we'll
quickly get into that and then I'll
check the other stuff here
we have a product box that I'll use the
flip out knife first you ready all right
whoa no pressure required Wow yes I'll
have to be very careful with this thing
okay just quickly I got to the Corp III
sent over
via PC case q from Thermaltake and that
is for my personal thread Ripper build
there'll be more information on that but
at the moment I am using the thread
Ripper 1950 X as my main Ruger had been
for a while now and loving it but it's
about time I did a proper build at the
moment it's not really built into
anything it's just sitting at the end of
my desk on a bit of foam so I'll be
using like that for a few months now so
I thought it's about time I stopped
being lazy and actually did a build so
it's going in this but more on that
later all right here we go let's the
other tape holds up yep
doesn't really put up much of a fight
with that blade I think Ted Ernie's
knives is just making the unboxing
experience too easy
well we've got a lot of gear in this box
here we go lots and lots of really
awesome looking sleeve cables priory c7
cable mud stuff we have to pay bit of
attention to this I like these blue
cables
so these are this is an extension kit so
you basically use your PSU cables that
came with your PSU TAC these guys on the
end and these are the parts that will
pop out and you'll see in the build and
they're nice thick sleeve cables they
look great and the combs work really
well with these there's a few more combs
included so yeah I'm probably going to
use these in my thread Ripper built in
the Corp III they've also sent along
some black and red sleeved cables which
will no doubt make their way into a
build soon alright let's give this guy a
go so we have two boxes of the cable mod
Pro Series cable kits how do I open
these without destroying the box there
we go like that alright so these
particular cables are designed to work
with Corsair power supplies because I
have mostly spare corsair power supplies
at the moment and they'll be being used
in my next few bills and so these aren't
extension cables these replace the
cables that came with your PSU so you
have nice individually sleeved cables
straight from the power supply unit all
the way to the motherboard or whatever
you're connecting them to yeah they feel
extremely high-quality really nice we're
very keen to do a build with these I
don't have any pricing information or
anything like that for you guys but I
will provide links to buy these in
Australia and the US in the video
description and I've got another kit of
black cables here so anyway they're
gonna be very handy for all math home
builds on my building they're gonna have
a nice sleeve cable so thank you PC case
gear for sending over the cable motor
cables and I also got the crier ec7 and
that will be for I'm actually gonna try
and squeeze that in the in winner Chopin
I'm doing a Raven Ridge apu build
shortly so we'll see how that goes not
sure how it fits but we'll find out I
think Brian managed to get one and he's
build for the giveaway pcs that we're
doing so it probably does fit ok we'll
grab will go with this white package
next
and we will cut it open
haha be careful if the products in the
packages with those knives and count
fingers every time I use it ok we
actually have here the Plantronics rig
800 LX so I believe this is their new
wireless headset yep 24-hour battery so
that would probably mean their Wireless
and this is possibly no I think this is
four it says
Xbox or Leverett but I believe this can
work with PC while it obviously works
with PC but uh PlayStation all that
they've just got the Xbox branding on it
anyway let's pop it open out cuttin a
finger off and have a look what's inside
oh yeah they're very much ovary
hold on incredibly well you know I get
this off alright so I believe this is
Plantronics latest headset and I have no
idea what the pricing is it's not
available in the US or Australia yet at
least any other retailers I checked
which was pretty much all of them so
pricing information to come if it's
available by the time you see this video
the link will be in the video
description they're extremely
comfortable as I said it is a wireless
headset so you've got this little box
this little box here so this connects
via USB to your computer and then
wirelessly connects to the headset the
headset themselves how they say
Plantronics says it has a 24 hour
battery it's got a 1500 milliamp battery
inside it and as you'd expect it's got a
10 meter range and it takes 30 minutes
to charge the battery for 3 hours of use
so yeah if it goes flat 30 minutes or
get you get you buy for a three hour
session so that's not too bad all the
controls to control volume
Michael that sort of stuff on the
headset themselves so you'll have to get
pretty familiar with them and know what
buttons you're touching like previous
versions that use this frame it is a
modular frame so you can pop the the
cans out and change them that way for
sort of the different shape and size
heads you've got a nice soft band here
that supports really well I'm surprised
they don't feel like they grab your head
that tight but they are hold on probably
as good as any heads that I've ever
tried before
yeah they're they don't move or wriggle
or anything at all even when you throw
your head around quite aggressively they
they hold on really well I probably look
a bit silly doing this one trying to
describe how it feels but whatever ah
and then also you do have a non
removable microphone but that's fine it
folds away I kind of like the weight
after unplug it or whatever to make it
you know get it out of the way so it
just falls down nicely put it off to the
side here slightly and it should sound
quite good so yeah these feel really
solid but I'll give them a whirl later
and see how they go all right let's aha
get into this bag here and see what we
got
alright the products are down that ends
so we're we're safe to give it a go oh
hello the new Samsung 860 Pro and 860
Evo SSDs I've been wanting to get my
hands on these and it looks like I
finally have so they're the 500 gigabyte
and 512 gigabyte versions
I haven't obviously tested these yet but
I've seen a few reviews on them a
performance seems to be quite good they
are actually very similar in terms of
performance except the pro model is
significantly more expensive the pro
version uses 64 layer 3d mlc v-nand so
MLC being key there whereas the Evo
version uses the TLC stuff it's still 64
layer 3 DVD and it's just at TLC so the
endurance / well the insurance rating is
half that of the equivalent size so the
512 gigabyte version whatever the
endurance rating is for this I don't
actually have it on hand this will be
half that so this is
basically going to last longer as far as
I'm aware though performance is very
much the same they both saturate at the
asada interface the serial ata six
gigabits per second interface and that
being the case cuz I think really even
the endurance of this model is very good
the Evo is probably going to be the
model to get and as I said it is
significantly more affordable whereas
you're paying just a hundred and fifty
dollars us and that's for the five
hundred gigabyte model so $150 us for
the Evo and works out to be about it's
two hundred forty dollars Australian
this model here is two hundred fifty US
and yeah I thought that was a pricing
error but it's three hundred and forty
five dollars Australian so $100 more for
basically the same capacity the same
performance you just get better
endurance so for the kind of users their
target with the 860 it's not like
Enterprise or even extreme high and
stuff that'll be in 960 pro so this is
your more mainstream stuff it is just so
tough so I don't really see the point of
the pro series of course I haven't
tested them reviewed them yet but just
on paper and the pricing this makes no
sense anyway I won't go on about them
too much these are the two and a half
inch versions they come in mSATA and m2
2280 form factor so I'll probably do
some sort of review on these shortly
alright actually I'll put this knife
away for a moment and we'll try out the
little guy again cool let's go for it
gotta be very careful not to plunge too
far into the box of these knives cuz I
yeah that could end badly all right
we've got some paper hello we've got
some some Arctic coolers and fans and
thermal paste
all right so I don't think we featured
any Arctic coolers on the harbour unbox
channel before I've certainly used their
products not recently but I've used them
in the past so we have some mx4 thermal
compound that will come in a very handy
for benchmarking CPUs and we have
bionics f1 2015 and we have the summer
light that looks like it's a USB fan
let's have a quick look at that I think
this is a desk fan yet looks like it
would be a desk fan so we go a little
flexible steel arm here yeah while you
guys can see that but I'm gonna leave
that there it's blowing some nice cool
air on me so that's convenient haha
we'll jump into this guy because this is
a popular item at the moment the freezer
33 eSports Edition so kind of
interesting to put the eSports into it
but anyway bat aside this is a really
good value really high-quality cooler so
as the Box gave away I have the yellow
version you can also get it in white
green and I believe red so with the
highlights there so you can see that
boasts it's actually pretty much just
the fans that I have the highlight so if
you put the white fans on it becomes
black white so on the base here we have
four direct touch copper heat pipes that
would give you pretty good coverage on a
Verizon or a coffee like CPU as you can
see is a 120 millimeter tower style
cooler with a push-pull fan
configuration pair of 120 millimeter
fans and they are fluid dynamic bearing
fans so high quality fans they should
our lasts a long time and be reasonably
quiet and the heatsink is made up of 49
fins and they're all half a millimeter
thick so plenty of fins there and the
great thing about this cooler is that
out of the box it does support the a m4
platform and all the the Intel platforms
there is a custom thread Ripper version
as well of this cooler an arctic say it
can dissipate up to 320 watts of heat
though they recommend only using it with
CPUs with TDPS up to 160
which is still pretty extreme so as I
said at the start of the unboxing of
this cool that is a very popular item
it's basically because of the price and
it is a high quality cooler as I've just
said it's got a pair of high quality
fans nice big heatsink its supports all
latest platforms and it's only $33 u.s.
so certainly one of the better coolers
priced under $40 so with they think you
just get the little satchel type packet
thing or separately you can buy a nice
big tube if you plan to do a bit of
overclocking install it remove it re see
it all that sort of stuff that tubes how
much more handy than the satchels these
are sort of a one-time-only deal and
then just finally before we move on we
have some fans right so these bionics f1
$25 free zuv 33 so if you want to match
your case fans to the fans on the CPU
cooler then you can buy these
individually and stick them in your case
and for those of you that don't like all
the flashy RGB lighting or just LED
lighting in general then this will be a
breath of fresh air because these don't
feature any kind of lights but even so
despite the lack of lights it's still a
fancy looking fan alright that's pretty
much all that will get this out of the
way what have we got to three more boxes
we use the little guy again and we will
get into this big box
a MIDI have sent over a thread Ripper
1920 X because I don't have a 1920 X to
the moment so I've got one of those now
we won't waste any time on that though
that's just for benchmarking and we have
another package here we have the blue
Yeti blackout Edition and this is the
USB model ultimate professional USB
microphone ok well I've heard plenty
about the blue Yeti microphones but I've
never actually seen one in the flesh and
I have to say it is a big heavy mic but
it certainly feels a very high quality
the base is steel the frame is steel and
then the microphone itself is wrapped in
some kind of metal so this USB version
of the IDE costs one hundred and thirty
dollars u.s. or one hundred and seventy
dollars Australian which seems very
reasonable for this type of microphone
and I have the blackout version the
black version it also comes in gray
white and silver there are a few dials
and knobs and things on the microphone
so on the back here we have gain which
is quite easily quite easy I should say
to move around so that is an analog dial
there so you can increase or decrease
the gain very easily and then under the
gain button we have a button labeled
pattern basically that changes the
pattern of the microphone how it picks
up audio so I don't have the exact
pattern information here based on these
little icons but I can sort of guess so
it's actually quite difficult to turn
which is good because you probably don't
to accidentally knock that we're using
it but you can change it to sort of like
a dual broadcast mode by looking at this
so it'll pick up sound from the front
and back side so you can have a
conversation with someone at opposite
sides of a table or you can set it up to
pick up audio just directly in front of
it so this side but yeah there are four
different patterns you can choose from
in total then on the front side we have
volume for monitoring so for your
headphone
and then a mute button those of you
wondering there is also an XLR version
of this mic and I actually do want to
get my hands on the XLR version because
that's probably the one that Tim and I
would use for our live stream but this
particular version is a USB so it just
connects directly up to your computer
but anyway yeah I'm shocked by how big
this microphone is I've got my rode nt1
up here and it is significantly smaller
but anyway keen to give it a go and Tim
and I'll use that on the next live
stream and you guys can let us know how
it sounds
I've been trying to get my hands on one
of these for a while now excellent this
is really going to improve things so as
you guys know for a lot of videos I
provide gameplay footage I capture
gameplay with on-screen statistics and
all that kind of stuff and when I have
to do it in 1440p or 4k or anything
above 1080p basically I have to use real
live or shadow play so there is a bit of
overhead with that that's not ideal I
would rather use some sort of dedicated
capture device and well now I can
alghero is sent over their 4k 60fps
model of what's known as the 4k 60 Pro
so this is a PCI Express capture device
you put this in your main capturing then
you input in the PC you want to capture
the footage from and you can then record
it from the capture PC so very cool
indeed so there's the card itself and
you've got your HDMI in and out there
and one high quality HDMI cable is
included be anyway keen to put that in
to my capture system and check it out
see how well it works you'll probably
see that footage in a video later this
week and for those of you wondering it's
$390 us or 550 Australian dollars so it
is an expensive bit of kit but it also
does what most capture devices can't and
that is capture 4k footage Andrew so
it's 60 FPS so a bit specialized there
all right time to check out the last
product and this is the deep cool Baron
case liquid and I saw this at Computex
last year we're not that far of calm
protector this year and I'm finally
getting my hands on
so anyway let's open up and take a look
alright so we have the white version of
the bearing case liquid and this
particular model sells for one hundred
and forty dollars u.s. or two hundred
and thirty Australian dollars so it does
make it a fairly pricey case but it is
all metal so that's an important thing
to remember there so the whole front
panels steel the top panel steel this
little sort of almost handle looking
device at the top is steel and then this
side panel is tempered glass so it is
very high-quality you've got a steel
panel on the left side or right side
depending on how you look at it and one
of the very cool features of this case
is sort of is suggested by the name it
comes with a pre-installed liquid
cooling system with a 120 millimeter
radiator stuck in the top and it also
has a cool flow meter right here and
that will be lit up and your better set
through the case door when everything's
set up but I'll take the door off and
talk a little bit more about what's
inside the internal design of this case
will probably surprise a few of you it
is quite a small case and just by
looking at it you probably think it
supports micro ATX motherboards but you
would be wrong it supports full sized
ATX boards and it does that through a
very unique internal design what we're
good very good yeah I am quickly running
out of room in here I've thrown stuff
everywhere alright so normally in a case
you would have the power supply in the
basement here the bottom possibly at the
top here but in this particular case it
is in it neither spot there is a power
input at the back here but as you can
see there's sort of nowhere to put your
power supply that is because the power
supply actually goes up in the top here
at the front so a bit strange a bit
unusual certainly very different but
that's how they've managed to put
full-size ATX motherboard here it goes
right down the bottom and there is no
power supply in the bottom you can see
the power cable runs around and goes up
to the front here and then the power
supply goes up in here and you connect
it up that way so quite different I
don't know how
that works haven't built in it yet but I
would like to and then to lock the
liquid cooler in place they've installed
a plastic sort of bracket here so you'd
have to remove that put your motherboard
in and then you can put the waterblock
on top of your CPU and like the white
themed case it is a white water block
but everything in this case it's pretty
much Haji B so the flowmeters RGB the
120 millimeter fan on the 120 millimeter
radiator is RGB the liquid cooler is RGB
and there are light strips in the front
panel here and they're also RGB so loads
of RGB options on this case so it'll
look pretty spectacular all lit up
yeah really unique kind of case I like
the fact that it's an all-metal body
there's no plastic anywhere and when I
saw it at Computex the LED lighting all
the effects and all that came together
really nicely so yeah I'd like to do a
building this some not sure what or when
but if we can build something in this
case I think that'd be pretty cool let
me know what you guys think anyway and
well that brings us to the end of
another episode of unboxing boxes a lot
of cool products this episode really
enjoyed using my new knives big thank
you to Ted from sky soldier blades these
things are just phenomenal I can't wait
to play with them a bit more oh yeah
really cool knives but now I have the
issue of working out which one of these
actually want to give to Tim because to
be honest I don't want to give a hitter
of these two Tim you might have
something to say about that but anyway
maybe you guys could let me know in the
comment section below which one of these
knives you would like to see me using
for future unboxing boxes episodes maybe
Tim and I could swap every now and then
I do like the black knife though the
fold-out knife very cool
anyway I'll leave that to you guys to
decide
I'm keen to go get my thread Ripper
build puts together and I'll probably
use these cables because these cable on
cables look pretty amazing anyway that's
going to do it for this episode of
unboxing boxes I'm your host Steve and
I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
