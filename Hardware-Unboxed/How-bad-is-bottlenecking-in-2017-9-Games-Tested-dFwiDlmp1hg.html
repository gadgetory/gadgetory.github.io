I've got a benchmark video for you guys
and in a way it's a bit of a follow-up
to last week's discussion about
quad-core CPUs for gaming in late 2017
it's not a direct follow-up but there
will be a few areas of overlap the focus
here is on bottlenecking whether that be
CPU or GPU bottlenecking
and I'll be checking out a range of very
different games so some will be old some
will be new so we'll be CPU bound others
will be GPU bound for the benchmarks I
have grabbed a few different CPUs and
this isn't an AMD versus Intel
comparison so I'm not picking you know
in I'm not matching up Intel CPUs with
AMD CPU so you're not gonna see like an
r5 1600 vs. 77 oh okay battle here we've
done plenty of that so it's just a few
random CPUs of different price
categories doesn't matter which side of
the fence they're on and we're comparing
them with a range of graphics card so
like the geforce gtx 1060 1070 and 1080
at 1080p and this should give you a
pretty good idea of what kind of CPU and
GPU pairing makes sense for your
particular budget and the game should
plan on playing and also show you just
how much say lower in CPUs like the g 45
60 and rise in 312 hundred are limiting
the performance of higher MGP such as
the gtx 1070 and 1080 should you be
crazy enough to pair a $100 CPU with a
$400 plus GPU your flippin loonies but
then I guess us reviewers kind of do
that all the time don't we anyway so
what was the end of the benchmarks we'll
also check out some overclocking results
as well so that should be pretty cool so
with that let's jump into the benchmarks
first up we have battlefield 1 and here
you can see using something like the GTX
1060 there is no difference in
performance between the various CPUs the
g45 16 matches the core i7 7700 k with a
minimum of 71 FPS and an average of 80
fps granted you might see a larger
variance when in the heat of a 64 player
battle but sadly that's just not
possible to accurately benchmark
anyway I personally have found the G 45
60 and GTX 1060 combo acceptable for
multiplayer action you certainly can't
complain with the price up
creating to the gtx 1070 and we start to
see a real separation between the
various CPUs tested the 7700 okay is now
up to 28 percent faster than G 45 60
that said the risin and Core i5 7400
CPUs still look quite good however once
we move to the geforce gtx 1080 things
start to change quite a lot now the 77
okay offers around 50% more performance
in the g 45 60 and it's even 20% faster
than the core i5 7400 so as expected
with higher-end GPUs you really need a
powerful CPU to take full advantage
moving on we have the f1 2016 results
I'm using the older 2016 version as f1
2017 came out after I gathered most of
these results when I was testing the
Rison 3 CPUs anyway some interesting
results nonetheless even though we see
the same 71 FPS average framerate with
most of the CPUs tested using the gtx
1060 there is a small difference in the
1% low results then things change
massively once we step up to the gtx
1070 here the g 45 60 starts to fall
quite far behind especially when looking
at the 1% low result here it was 33%
slow with just 55 FPS when compared to
the 77 arcades 83 FPS that said the
horizon and core i5 processors do hang
in there quite well with the 1070
however once we step up to the gtx 1080
the 7700 k is fully unleashed and now it
can be seen pulling miles ahead of the
core i5 7400 and Rison v 1400 the 77
arcade was almost 80% faster in the g 45
60 as well in what was a true display of
dominance right so battlefield 1 and f1
2016 are very CPU intensive titles that
utilize multi-core CPUs very well Far
Cry primal on the other hand isn't
particularly demanding on the CPU and
it's certainly one of the more GPU bound
titles we'll be testing with that being
the case we unsurprisingly see no real
difference in performance with the
geforce gtx 960 between the 5 cpus
tested moving to the gtx 1070 we find
the core i5 and core i7 cpus are able to
deliver noticeably better 1% lower
results of course you can slow overclock
the rise in CPUs and we'll look at that
a bit later on then with the GT x 1080
we see much the same
performance on all processes tested with
the exception of the 77 or okay
while the G 4560 Core i5 and rise and
CPUs all limit the GTX 1080 to 1070
light performance meanwhile the 77 okay
boost the average frame rate by 32%
making it 41% fast and the G 45 60 I
don't suspect anyone would pair RG 45 60
with a GTX 1080 but if you did this is
why it would be a bad idea with total
war Warhammer we return to an extremely
CPU demanding title and as such even the
GTX 1060 shows up the G 45 60
shortcomings as this lower clock to
dual-core does start to fall behind if
we jump up to the gtx 10a we find the
horizon 3 and verizon 5 cpus aren't
really able to increase performance over
what was seen with the gtx 1070 it is
worth mentioning that we've discovered
this is due to the way in videos drivers
handle the DirectX 12 API on their
Pascal based GPUs anyway that's not the
focus of this video even if we look at
the core i5 and core i7 processors with
the gtx 1070 there is now quite a bit of
separation this is accentuated with the
gtx 1080 and now the 77 ok is almost 30%
faster than the core i5 7400 meanwhile
it's 71 percent faster and the g 45 60
overwatch has yet another cpu intensive
title that takes advantage of core heavy
cpus at least as well as any DirectX 11
title does here we see that with the gtx
1060 all 5 cpu configurations provides
similar results however once again
moving to the gtx 1070 starts to mix
things up a bit though it is mostly the
g 45 six that's lagging behind the g 45
60 finds its limits with the gtx 1070
and this can be seen we're moving to the
1080 virtually no increase in framerate
is seen meanwhile the 77 or EK is now
24% faster with the 1080 and that means
it's 53% fast and the g 45 60 so yet
again we see a clear and very large
example of cpu bottlenecking
the witcher 3 is one of the first games
to really make good use of quad-core
CPUs but even so the hyper threading
enabled G 4560 does very well in this
title overall we do appear to be
primarily GPU limited here
and even with the GTX tonight he
installed the 77 okay isn't able to pull
away from the core i5 memorize and
processes moving on we have some Rainbow
six siege results and here the 7700 K is
able to squeeze a little more out of the
1060 though the one percent low figure
is much the same
a similar situation is seen with the gtx
1070 and then finally with the gtx
Tenaya installed the semi summary kate
is now significantly faster at least
when comparing the average frame rate
World of Tanks is all about that single
thread performance so higher clock
speeds rule here and this is why the
horizon 3 1300 X is able to outpace the
risin 5 1400 the 7700 K and its high out
of the box operating frequency also
gives an advantage here though it was
something like a gtx 1060 you won't see
any real difference as we move to the
gtx 1070 the core i5 and core i7 cpus
pull ahead in their now offering around
10% more frames than the r3 1300 x then
with the GT X 1080 installed the 77 ok
races ahead and is now 19 percent faster
than the core i5 7400 almost 30% faster
than the G 45 60 like World of Tanks
Counter Strike global Offensive doesn't
utilize multi-core CPUs very well and
the 77 error case superior IPC
performance and higher operating
frequencies do give it a significant
advantage in this title even with the
gtx 1060 installed we see a rather large
difference in performance between the
core i5 and core i7 cpus when compared
to the pentium and rising cpus then once
we get up to the gtx 1070 and 1080
graphics cards the cpu bottlenecking is
quite extreme with most of the CPUs
tested before wrapping things up let's
see how the horizon 3 am rising 5 CPUs
compared to the 7700 ok once overclocked
to be clear we're not overclocking the
77 or ok just the rise in CPUs
the 1300 X has been replaced with an
overclocked r3 1200 and that's been
clocked at 4 gigahertz while the core i5
7400 has been replaced with the old
Sandy Bridge Core i5 2500k
which has been clocked at a very mild
4.4 gigahertz
the rosen 5 1400 has now also been
overclocked to 4 gigahertz while the 77
hurricane as I said has been left
untouched and of course so too has the
locked Pentium G 45 60
first looking at battlefield one we see
that we are again GPU limited with the
GTX 1060 but as we move to the gtx 1070
the midfield looks a bit more
competitive that said even with the
overclock the rise in CPUs are still
slower than what we saw previously with
the core i5 7400 at least in this
particular title that said with the GT X
1080 installed the rise in CPUs now
somehow come back and pull ahead of
where the i5 7400 was and they're also
now not a great deal slower than the 77
ok so that's interesting the r5 1400 for
example is now just 10% slower which
isn't bad given its price here we see
that when testing with overwatch that
overclocking the horizon 5 1400 really
helped it close the gap on the 77 okay
with the gtx 1070 the quad core rise and
3 still struggles and in fact the
overclocked r3 1200 is no faster than
what we saw with the stock r3 1300 X and
this is down to the fact that xf r is
disabled once we have a clock however
once again we see that with the gtx 10a
the rise and cpus actually do better
which is quite surprising at least when
compared to what we saw with the stock
figures previously the r3 1200 at 4
gigahertz is now 6 percent faster than
the r3 1300 x when comparing the 1% low
result even so these CPUs are clearly
limiting the GTX 1080s performance as
the 77 RK was able to extract noticeably
more frames the last game that I'm going
to look at with these overclocked
results is World of Tanks and here the
overclock rise and CPUs are able to
catch up though they aren't able to
match the stock 77 or acade still as
expected overclocking the rise in 3 &amp;amp; 5
CPUs to 4 gigahertz does reduce the
bottleneck but even so in these older
titles they still struggle to get the
most out of even the gtx 1070 so how bad
is bottlenecking in 2017 I hear you ask
or was that that's what the video is
asking anyway well that all depends on
how bad you are at pairing appropriate
hardware any experienced system builder
will tale it's important to build a
balanced system especially if you want
to receive the maximum bang for your
buck trying a future-proof though that's
generally just a waste of money you're
best off looking at what hardware combos
deliver the best results right now
and just go from there for example if
you're addicted to overwatch and this is
the game that you'll be playing
primarily for the forseeable but you can
only afford a geforce gtx 1070 for
example and i say only because it is a
$400 GPU or not the $700 gtx 1080i but
yes i get that it is still a very
expensive GPU anyway if the gtx 1070 is
as good as it's possibly going to get
for you spending over $300 on the 77 or
okay might not be a smart choice when
the $160 isin 5 1400 delivers a very
similar experience for a fraction of the
price for those playing overwatch though
this also appears to be true for most
other titles as well once overclocked
they are both able to get the most out
of the gtx 1070 in this cpu intensive
title but what about the future I hear
you say we saw that even when
overclocked the r5 1400 was still 10%
slower than the 77 are ok with the GTX
1080 and that margin will no doubt grow
with the 1080i and faster GPUs in the
future I guess
I'd first question how many of you
stretching your budget for something
like a gtx 10:17 now I'm going to turn
around and upgrade the GPU within a 24
month period I'd say almost none of you
will do that so in 3 to 4 years when you
finally upgrade the gtx 1070 it's then
that i'd evaluate where the Rison 5:14
hundreds at and potentially the m4
platform for that matter it's likely
going to make much more sense to take
the money you save now and put that
towards an upgrade in a few years time
rather than future proof now which will
no doubt just result in more wasted
money right now the 7700 K is the
cheapest that's ever been as the 8700 K
is due out next week that aside though
at 310 dollars plus at least 110 dollars
for a budget z2 70 board and say $30 for
a cooler you've invested at least 450
dollars a smarter option right now might
be to buy the horizon 5 1400 for example
it costs 160 dollars put that on a be
350 motherboard for $70 and you've got
about of $230 combo there that's almost
half the price of what you would have
spent on the 77
kay system and of course as we've just
seen you will get a very similar
experience with the gtx 1070 then as i
said in two or three years you can look
at spending the other half of the money
you just saved on another two hundred
and thirty dollar CPU and motherboard
combo and that is assuming you can't
reuse the a m4 motherboard for as m2 cpu
for example and I'm sure there's similar
scenarios you could make with an Intel
processor certainly as I said after next
week I'm just giving this example now
because it's a valid example that exists
right now and on that note of course all
of this will need to be re-evaluated
shortly when we get the eighth
generation course abuse and of course
we'll be taking an in-depth look at that
very soon as for the argument that quad
cores shouldn't be used for gaming
anymore and that is the four core for
threaded quad cores well you can see why
that's a bit silly there's nothing wrong
with the rise and three series or
intel's
dual cores with hyper-threading enable
for that matter we've paired with a
sensible GPU of course something like
the gtx 1060 as we just saw those buying
a $400 gtx 1070 or maybe a $500 plus GT
X 1080 probably out looking at spending
a hundred dollars on their CPU so if
it's various kind of users that are
saying quad cores are no good for gaming
well they probably don't understand the
budgets of guys buying $100 CPUs anyway
the rise and three series along with the
intel pentium g 4560 or really any of
the cable akin skylake dual cores that
have hyper threading enabled those CPUs
are targeted at budget shoppers budget
gamers and at the high end or the top of
any budget gamers wishlist you'll find
something like a GTX 1060 or the rx 580
if they were affordable at the moment
anyway gtx 1060 type performance not a
gtx 1080 and for the vast majority of
games something like you know these
affordable cpus whether it be the r3
1200 or a g40 560 they're really
indistinguishable from something like
the 77 okay when using a gtx 1060 and we
also saw because the r3 1200 does it's
an unlocked part you can overclock it we
found once overclocked does hang in
there pretty well with something like a
gtx 1070 so there is a bit of future
proofing available there well that's
going to do it for
I hope that helps those of you trying to
work out what kind of CPU and GPU
pairing will suit your budget and needs
best yeah like I said that pretty much
does it for this one I don't have
anything else to say on the subject I
hope you enjoyed the video like it
subscribe if you haven't already
those are good things to do maybe go
back and watch episode 4 of upgrade my
PC please that was a really cool episode
if you vote you can win a naturally
yeah very dings closed by now it closed
yesterday afternoon so if you haven't
voted you probably missed out on a
really sweet prize but in two days time
what is it set though something a couple
of days time there'll be another episode
and you better vote and win a really
cool prize and that's global so yeah
we've had a couple of winners around the
world already and yeah so suppose in the
meantime I don't really know what you
can do with your time maybe you go back
and watch a really long unboxing video
or something yeah oh I'm your host Steve
I'll catch you guys next time yeah I'll
go third that was pretty smooth that
