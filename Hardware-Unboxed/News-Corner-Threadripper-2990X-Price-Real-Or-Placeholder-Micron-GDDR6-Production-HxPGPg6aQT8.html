corner a slow week for hardware news but
there's still a few interesting bits and
pieces to go through plus I'll go into a
few rumors and leaks at the end so let's
get straight into it the biggest
hardware news story out of this week
concerns memory specifically GDD our six
my phone has announced they have begun
mass producing GDD are six memory
joining both Samsung and SK Hynix as
producers of the new memory this
completes the trifecta of major memory
manufacturers producing G DDR 6 so there
should be plenty of supply for next
generation graphics cards especially
from a certain green company microns GDD
are six options for the graphics market
are simple OMS can either choose from 12
gigabit per second or 14 gigabit per
second chips at one point three five
volts with eight gigabit capacities
gddr5 typically operated at one point
five to one point six volts and topped
out at nine gigabit per second speeds in
the best bins so the top 14 gigabit per
second variant of GDD are 6 provides
more than 50% more bandwidth with lower
power consumption even 12 gigabit per
second chair ddr 6 will provide 50% more
bandwidth than the widely used eight
gigabit per second gddr5 GDD r 6 will
also supersede gddr5 X which didn't
really achieve wide adoption outside of
a few high-end nvidia gpus gddr5 x
topped out of 11 gigabit per second in
those GPUs so 14 gigabit per second year
DDR 6 will again give OMS about 27% more
bandwidth to play with and there's
plenty of room to grow there 16 gigabit
per second chips are coming to match
Samsung's announced 16 gigabit per
second GT they are six at one point
three five volts micron has also managed
to get G DDR 6 up to 20 gigabit per
second in their labs so we should be
able to see generational improvements
throughout the lifespan of GDD are 6
memory it's practically a certainty at
this point the new GPUs will use GT dr 6
memory so when and video finally gets
around to announcing them we should be
seeing a nice bump to memory bandwidth
without having to tap into extremely
expensive
HBM 2 we're approaching the launch of
AMD's second generation thread Ripper
CPU so it only makes sense the prices
for first gen 3
Rippa hitting all-time lows with
second-gen so close to launching the
prospect of an entirely refreshed lineup
with new 32 core and 24 core parts for
those that like cutting-edge technology
it's probably not the best idea to jump
in now and buy a third row per CPU but
the latest prices for the top-end 16
quart 1950 X in particular are quite
tasty for those that want a bargain as
spotted by techpowerup European prices
for thread Ripper
have dropped in the past few days with
the 1950 ex sitting below 650 euros at
the moment I quickly checked around some
Us stores and found Micro Center sewing
in 1950 ex purchased 630 dollars which
is an absolute steal relative to its
$1000 launch price you've been able to
buy the 1950 x4 750 dollars since early
June but this isn't even further
discount on that CPU if you wanted that
many cause Micro Center are also selling
the 18 called 1900 X for $350 below the
usual 450 dollars which is again a good
deal
there aren't any great deals on the 12
core 1920 X at this point though and in
fact current prices are still around
$700 which makes it a bad deal compared
to the 1950 X and we'll get to potential
threat Ripper to pricing later in this
video
this isn't a super news story but it is
something a number of you guys have been
asking me about specially now patreon
exclusive discord chat PC perspective
tore down this soos rog swift PG 27 uq
which is one of the new g-sync HDR
monitors and discovered the g-sync
module inside is a bit different to the
first gen g-sync module used in non HD
displays in fact the new g-sync HDR
board uses an alt era area 10 G X 480
FPGA alongside 3 gigabyte of ddr4 memory
to process data and short adaptive sync
works alongside HDR the FPGA alone is a
very expensive component retailing for
$2,600 in low quantities through major
component retailers even if Nvidia could
get a great deal on bulk purchases of
the FPGA they're still looking at an
estimated $500 for the chip alone plus
additional costs for the rest of the
g-sync module and potentially licensing
fees on top of that this makes it
painfully clear that a significant
portion of this monitors $2000 retail
price comes down to the G sync HDR
module it also
seems to fit the whole narrative
surrounding g-sync HDR and video was
struggling for a while to get HDR
working through their chasing chips
hence the delays for these monitors and
it seems part of their final solution
involved moving to a very expensive FPGA
hardware solution the cost of the g-sync
HDR module also widened the price gap
between g-sync HDR and free sync to attr
monitors AMD managed to successfully get
free sync to HDR working without any
additional chips similar to the original
free sync so we could see a 500 plus
dollar price gap between similar HDR
monitors depending on which adaptive
sync technology they support that does
suck for NVIDIA GPU owners but Nvidia
owners themselves to blame for going
down the dedicated hardware path rather
than sticking to open industry standards
Corsair has acquired Elgato gaming the
company behind a series of popular video
capture devices targeting game streamers
the terms of the deal were disclosed as
both companies are privately owned but
the deal does see Corsair gained most of
all God owes key product lines
specifically those around video game
capture and docking Elgato will operate
as a separate brand within Corsair and
well it's not clear what will happen to
their current product lines it seems
that everything will likely remain the
same Oh godoh will be keeping their
smart home appliance business under the
eve system's name which in itself is a
large and successful division of the
company and that'll operate separately
too Corsair but smart appliances
probably don't interest most gamers and
all the game related products will now
be owned by Corsair interesting to see
calls to expand to these sorts of
devices but they have been expanding
into a lot of new areas over the last
few years and this just continues that
trend in other game streaming news
avermedia has launched a new set of 4k
HDR capable game capture devices the key
device here is the live game of 4k which
is a PCIe add-in card that supports 4k
60 capture and HDR and capture of up to
1440p 144 and 1080p 240 with
pass-through of all those resolutions
and framerates
crucially it's cheaper than Elgato is
competing 4k 60 pro at $300 instead of
$400 while supporting HDR capture that
the elgato equivalent does not support
so it seems like a pretty decent device
there for those that want a more
portable solution avermedia also
launched the live game ultra
which is an external USB 3.1 gen2 on box
that is limited to 4k 30 non HDR capture
though it can pass through 4k 6 thdr it
also supports 1440p 60 and 1080p 120
capture so half the frame rate of the
PCI version the Ultra will set you back
250 dollars though if you have a desktop
PC the live game 4k does seem to be the
better deal as it pumps you up to you
know 60fps capture in 4k if you love SD
cards and just crave information on USD
technologies this news story will be
super exciting for the three people in
the world that fit that criteria the SD
Association has announced the SD 7.0
specification which paves the way for
ultra-fast SD cards includes a new SD
Express interface which is a combination
of PCIe x 1 and nvme allowing transfer
rates up to nine hundred and eighty five
megabytes per second significantly
faster than current gen SD cards SD 7.0
also brings a new class of cards SD
ultra capacity or SBU C which supports
capacities up to 128 terabytes current
SDXC cards top out at 2 terabytes which
were fast approaching crucially faster
SD Express cards will be backwards
compatible with existing SD card hosts
just at lower speeds while current SD
cards will also work in newer SD Express
slots razer has launched two keyboards
with new optomechanical switches the
Huntsman and the Huntsman elite the new
switches also known as Razer purple
switches are basically just optical
switches which we've seen before in a
few other keyboards rather than using a
mechanical switch to register key
presses optical switches use an infrared
sensor which is more durable and
lightning-fast however to retain the
clicky nature of mechanical keyboards
Reds as opto mechanical switches also
include a tactile bump during actuation
similar to raise the greens with an
actuation force of 45 grams and a key
press registration distance of 1.5
millimeters both keyboards include RGB
lighting but it's the Huntsman elite
that includes the most RGB plus
additional media controls and a wrist
rest the Huntsman will set you back 149
US dollars and the elite 199 Ozzy
pricing is absolutely outrageous
as with most Razer peripherals 250 bucks
for the Huntsman and a whopping 340
dollars for the elite a couple of
rumors and leaks to finish this news
corner off firstly we have a retail
listing for the thread Ripper 2990 X
which might have been put up early by a
mistake or it might just be full of
guesses who really knows what the sort
of rumors anycase European retailers
cyberport listed the 32 core thread
Ripper CPU as the 2990 X which we talked
about in last week's news corner
alongside a 1509 euro price tag if this
listing is accurate that it suggests a
fifteen hundred US dollar price tag for
the twenty nine ninety X which would be
a great price for a 32 core CPU and put
a lot of pressure on intel's h EDT
lineup steve and i estimated during our
Computex live stream that the 32 core
cpu would be priced between 1500 and
1700 dollars so this would be on the
lower end of that however there are a
few concerning things about the listing
that throw into question its validity
the title suggests it has a 3.4
gigahertz base clock with a 4.0
gigahertz boost with the description
list a 3.8 gigahertz clock speed the
description also claims that 180 watt
TDP even though AMD is already listed a
250 watt TDP for this processor and both
a 12 nanometer and 40 nanometer process
and mention when you consider these
things it's likely the listing is just a
placeholder for the CPU which means
everything down to the pricing might
just be a guess we'll certainly find out
in a few months the other leaked from
this week is a picture of an NVIDIA GPU
engineering board which was posted to
Reddit the prototyping board features 12
modules of micron G DDR 6 for 12
gigabytes in total along with 3 8 pin
power connectors and what looks like an
Envy link connector on the top plus a
bunch of components are hidden behind
several large active coolers and the GPU
itself is missing as video cards points
out this could be a geforce product or
it could be Quadra or tesla it's hard to
really say at this point but it is an
interesting look at what invidious
development boards look like before they
eventually transition into a final
product that's it for this week's news
