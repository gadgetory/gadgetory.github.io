unboxed video recently I put together a
video comparing the new NVIDIA GeForce
GTX 1050 Ti against AMD's Radeon rx for
64 gigabyte and rx 470 graphics cards in
terms of pricing the 1052 I pretty well
slots in between those two AMD products
and while better value than the rx for
64 gigabyte by a country mile I might
add if you're willing to spend a little
bit more than we recommended the RX 470
as it's a seriously good buy
however if you can only afford to spend
around say 150 u.s. or two hundred and
$20 readers then the GTX 1050 - I
appears to be the best value option at
this price point or is it recently when
doing a bit of poking around for
second-hand deals on eBay and some PC
forums I noticed a few Radeon r9 290
graphics cards we're going for what I
felt were very very low prices some sold
for as little as a hundred and fifty
dollars and we are talking Australian
dollars here hell that's gtx 750ti money
still for the most part 290 seem to be
fetching around $200 and that's still
very cheap for what is essentially an r9
390 well it is in our 939 with 4 gig of
ram but let's not into that rabbit hole
the r9 390 is currently retailing for
around $400 which makes these $200 to
90s all the more surprising within
videos new GT x 1050 Ti selling for at
least 220 ozzie this made me think which
is faster I then spent another second or
two mulling that one over before
realizing the answer was obviously the
r9 290 but how much faster is the r9 290
I hear you ask well let's find out and
while we're at it why not throw in an RX
470 as well
good idea for this test I've selected 6
new games all of which were benchmarked
1080p on a core i5 rig to avoid any
controversy on this one what am I saying
this is a GPU comparison controversies
all part of the fun anyway in an effort
to keep most happy we've ditched the
core i3 rig for a more
middle-of-the-road option in the core i5
6400 so not a core i7 not a core i3 hope
I'm sitting safe on the fence for this
one as always the latest drivers have
been used for testing and since I ran
these benchmarks over the weekend all
the numbers are nice and fresh
finally I'm not interested in how these
graphics cards comparing games released
in 2013 the year the r9 290 hit shelves
I want to know what it has to offer
gamers today when compared to brand-new
GPUs of similar costs such as the rx 470
and GTX 1050 TI right so let's get to
the good stuff then first up we have
Deus Ex mankind divided the game every
ethics touting radon rockin freesync
boasting fanboy were demanding reviewers
use the next 10 years I kid of course
anyway here we find some very
interesting results very exciting
results for those in the market for a
second-hand r9 290 AMD's old 2nd gen GCN
architecture still has some fight no yet
the 290 came out swinging delivering an
average of 66 fps making it 16 percent
faster than the rx 470 not only that but
it was almost 80% faster than the gtx
1050 TI I know that this is an AMD
supported title but damn that's a real
pantsing once again it looks like the
right gear for this war is the r9 290
here the r9 290 was 17% faster than the
RX 470 and 54% fast in the GT x 1050 Ti
and that there is a very impressive win
for the old 290 as this is a title well
optimised for NVIDIA hardware for
testing f1 2016 we use the built-in
benchmark with heavy rain enabled and
like max Verstappen the 290 had no
trouble delivering a strong result in
wet conditions although the 290 did fall
a few frames behind the RX 470 in this
title the performance was still mighty
impressive and enough to see the gtx
1050 trail by 34% margin when comparing
the average framerate results call of
duty infinite warfare the game literally
no one's playing anymore was tested
using the maxed out quality settings
with SMA a enabled here the r9 290 was
again a few frames slowly our x4 70 but
I have a 50% fast and the GTX 1050 Ti so
a strong result for AMD is high in 2013
graphics card for those of you that find
Cod to slow paced we have titanfall 2
and for those that want to play
titanfall 2 it well over 60 FPS for that
breaking the bank we have the r9 290
the r9 290 pulled ahead of the RX 470
rendering 12% more frames
it was also 37% fast in the GTX 1050 TI
for good measure not playing either
infinite warfare or titanfall 2 well we
don't blame your battlefield one doesn't
need space or max suits it has good
graphics and quality game planetside it
also has DirectX 12 support though that
feature is a little questionable right
now the raid on graphics cards were
tested using DirectX 12 while the
geforce card the gtx 1050 TI in other
words was tested using DirectX 11 DX 12
does suffer from larger dips in
performance so for now those minimums do
look a bit dodgy still if you switch
either the rx 470 or r9 290 over to
DirectX 11 the average framerate looks
much the same while the minimum is much
improved so you might be wondering why
do we test AMD cards with your index 12
then well because if we don't where
somehow Nvidia shells and since Nvidia
aren't paying us why take the heat right
speaking of heat let's check out how
much juice these GPU suck down mmm yeah
the catch the 290 is a bit of a power
Pig total system consumption reached 330
watts that's certainly not extreme but
it's well over double what the GTX 1050
TI configuration hit it's also over 100
watts more than the RX 474 a similar
level of performance thankfully to
combat the inevitable high thermal load
that comes with that kind of consumption
most 290 graphics cards feature huge
heat sinks and array of fans finally a
look at efficiency by comparing power
consumption and average framerate
performance I know most of you guys
aren't in a scatter plots here so an
easy to digest bar graph has been
included as you can see overall the 290
was on average 8% fast and the RX 470
but push power consumption 55% higher in
the process not an ideal scenario but we
kind of knew that was coming given the
two nineties well-documented tendency to
gobble up those watts
I probably shouldn't admit this but that
was fun
I have fond memories of the Radeon r9
290 series back in October of 2013 the
mind-blowing the complex r9 290x landed
boasting 2,816 cores and a $550 asking
price to match it was a big middle
finger to Nvidia at the time taking
their Titan
nearly half the price and as expected
this gutsy play provoked a response from
Nvidia that response was the GTX 780 Ti
but once again stealing in videos
Thunder was the 290 series AMD came out
with the vanilla 290 priced at just $400
it didn't just take out the GTX 780 but
to a degree also the 290x
offering similar performance at a
fraction of the price memory lane now
exactly three years later I find myself
once again recommending the r9 290 as
one of the best value options for gamers
so then the volcanic islands love some
fire left in them yet see what I did
there
yeah the nerdy guys will get it
comparing the GTX 1050 Ti and r9 290 is
a bit like a head-to-head battle between
a price and a Hummer the 290 was
hands-down faster 54% faster on average
in fact still fuel efficiency isn't
great total consumption was almost three
times higher it's a staggering figure as
significant as that figure is though I'm
sure many gamers will be able to live
with it all that extra performance from
the r9 290 at the same price is probably
too difficult to pass up given what
we've seen here if power consumption
isn't of great concern I feel the r9 290
provides gamers with the most bang for
their buck again these graphics cards
are readily available on the second-hand
market for around $200 Ozzy sometimes
even less and that actually makes them a
bit cheaper than the GTX 1050 Ti if
pricing is similar in your region then I
highly recommend checking out the r9 290
well that's all from me on this one guys
I hope you enjoyed the comparison and if
you know of any other really good
secondhand graphics card buyers let me
know in the comments below and I'll do a
bit of investigating and compare it to a
current generation GPU to see which one
delivers the most bang for your buck
with that I'm your host Steve and I will
catch you guys next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
