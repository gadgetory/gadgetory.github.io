news corner for 2018 there is one more
week in the abode Steve know we'll be
taking a bit of time off to get away
from the benchmarks and actually see our
families for once we do have a bit of
content plan throughout the remainder of
2018 but we're only aiming for a video
every second day rather than every day
like we've been doing for well almost a
year now
we hope all of you guys watching have a
great holiday period as well take some
time for yourself
and wind down after a busy 2018 anyway
there have been a few interesting topics
this week to finish up news corner for
the year so let's get into them
OMB has just scraped in before Christmas
with the announcement of the Athlon 220
GE and Athlon 240 G which we've been
expecting I guess for a little while now
like the already released Athlon 200 GE
the new at 220 G and 240g are 2 core for
thread CPUs with three Baker compute
units the only real benefit the 220 and
240g provide our increased clock speeds
the 200 G was a 3.2 gigahertz part while
the to 20 G pushes up to 3.4 gigahertz
and the 240 G increases that to 3.5
gigahertz so very modest improvements
there and as before there is no boost
clock functionality all Athlon cpus come
with a conservative 35 watt TDP which I
guess makes sense consuming a low core
count and modest clock speeds in terms
of pricing there's a $10 difference
between the CPUs the 200g is $55 the
220g is $65 and the 240g comes in at $75
and all are available to purchase today
the 220 and 240 GE are kind of pointless
products if I'm honest aim DS Athlon
lineup are supposed to be multiplied a
lot so you can't just overclock a 200 G
up to the level of a 220 G or 240 G that
would justify the price difference you
know if you can't overclock them you
left with spending a bit more cash to
get a bump to clock speeds but right now
you actually can overclock the 200 GE we
recently did a video showing that on MSI
motherboards with a certain bias
revision the multiplier for the
Yugi has been unlocked so you can
overclock it just like any other Rison
processor I believe something gigabyte
boards have unlocked 200g overclocking
now as well so with very little effort
it's currently possible to overclock the
200 GE into a 240 GE so there's really
not much point buying the $75 240g when
you can just spend fifty five dollars on
the 200 GE and do some quick
overclocking it's actually even better
than that because we were able to
overclock the Athlon 200 g to 3 point 8
gigahertz which is 300 megahertz higher
than what AMD provides with this stock
Athlon to 40 g so while you can
overclock the supposedly locked Athlon c
u--'s there's really not a lot of point
to buying the more expensive versions of
this processor a quick update to the
nvidia geforce r-tx 2060 situation
marketing materials have been discovered
by hardware locks showing that the
upcoming cheering based GPU will indeed
use our TX branding previous leaks have
indicated the card will have 1920 cuda
cores and 6 gigabytes of gddr5 a tracing
but this hasn't been confirmed and we
don't know at this point considering how
the our TX 2070 performed with ray
tracing enabled an ITX 2060 with fewer
RT cause would struggle even more rumors
are currently suggesting the our TX 2060
will launch in early 2019 perhaps a
couple of weeks into January and that's
also what we're hearing this old
timeframe would line up with a CES
announcement so stay tuned during CES
for potential mid-range cheering unveils
another leak appeared recently this time
concerning AMD's upcoming rise in mobile
3000 series ap use confusingly the Rison
3000 series for mobile processors would
actually be 2nd gen Russin mobile not
3rd gen because a.m. be launched the
first rise of mobile parts as the 2000
series any case that's not really into
the heck I guess new riser mobile AP us
were actually spotted last week by
Twitter user API sak with Geekbench
results potentially revealing the
horizon 3 3200 you
Rison 330 300 you and Rison 5 3500 you
although api sak also believes there
will be a 3700 you and 300 you these
processes is set to
be quite similar to rise in mobile
2000-series ap use the 3200 you for
example is a to call forth read part
like the 2200 you but with a 100
megahertz increase to the base clock
same story for the for call forth read
3300 you and for core 8 thread 3500 you
these apos were allegedly benchmarked in
a collection of HP laptops though
there's probably not a lot of point
reading into the exact benchmark numbers
at this stage as always you should take
these reports with a grain of salt but
this one is looking quite likely in our
opinion the original rise in mobile CPUs
were built using AMD's first gen Zen
architecture on 40 nanometers so it
makes sense that the next products would
be Zen plus on 12 nanometers as ambhi's
aps have lagged behind the server and
desktop CPU lines as far as architecture
and process tech are concerned moving
from 40 nanometers to 12 nanometers
would only allow for small clock speed
gains and that's what this leak is
suggesting we can then expect 7
nanometre rise mobile parts at the end
of next year or perhaps over 2020 we
really don't know at this stage though
we are expecting to hear more
information about new rise in mobile
products at CES in January 2019 intel
has made a minor announcement regarding
production capacity increases for a
number of their fabs as we all know
Intel are struggling to keep up with 14
nanometer demand so the company has
pledged to expand their capacity at 3
fabs across the globe specifically their
facilities in Oregon Ireland and Israel
these expansions are set to begin in
2019 and although Intel aren't detailing
exactly what they will be doing you'd
think the focus would be on 14 nanometer
capacity until also announced that they
are making good progress at fitting fab
42 in Arizona with duv and EUV tools for
their upcoming 7 nanometer process set
to come after 10 nanometer although
there's no word when that technology
will be ready also next gen storage and
memory technology will be worked on in
the company's new mexico manufacturing
facility LG is getting ready to unveil a
selection of new gaming and workstation
grade monitors at CES 2019 the most
interesting of the new products is the
ultra gear 38 GL 950 G a 38 inch ultra
wide with a 38 40 by 1600 resolution and
144 Hertz refresh rate we've had 38 40
by 1600 monitors
before but this is the first time we've
seen one of those panels capable of a
144 Hertz refresh making it suitable for
gamers in fact the monitor in general
could be highly attractive as it offers
a higher resolution and refresh rate
than existing 3440 by 1440 ultra wise at
120 Hertz this new LG panel uses the
company's nano IPS technology allowing
for 98% DCI p3 gamut coverage and this
particular model will feature g-sync
along with 450 Nets of peak brightness
LG is also set to show off the ultra
wide 49 WL 95 and yes the product name
actually is ultra white in this case
this looks similar to the Dell you 49:19
DW in that it's a dual 27 inch 1440p
monitor in other words it's actually 49
inches of monitor in total at a 50 120
by 1440 resolution offering the
equivalent of 2 27-inch 1440p monitors
side-by-side in the one display with
just a 60 Hertz refresh rate it's
designed for productivity featuring 99%
srgb coverage and 315 years of
brightness no word on a firm release
date or pricing for either of these
displays but we can expect to learn a
bit more about them at CES final topic
for this week bit of a shorter news
corner because I guess not much has been
happening a beta version of steam has
hinted at Xbox cross-play integration
some games on Steam like rocket league
do already support Xbox cross play but
it seems the latest steam better has
several pieces of code that directly
referenced the Xbox potentially paving
the way for easier cross play between
PCs and Microsoft's console without
using the awful Windows Store I'm also
hoping that one day Xbox consoles will
just run steam considering they're
basically x86 pcs and should be able to
support the full library of Steam games
I think that would be really awesome
maybe Microsoft has something in the
works for the next generation of Xbox
consoles which apparently are not too
far away anyway that's it for this
week's news corner and the final news
corner of 2018
