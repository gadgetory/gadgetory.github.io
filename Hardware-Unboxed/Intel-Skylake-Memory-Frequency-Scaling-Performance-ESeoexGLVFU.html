releases latest six generation core
microarchitecture codename skylake
unfortunately supply of the unlock 6700
KS 6600 k hasn't been great
and despite prices rising well above the
MSRP
this hasn't squashed demand it's
believed that intel still struggling to
improve manufacturing yield on as late
as 14 nanometer process the very process
upon which these skylake chips are built
it's actually hard to believe major
online retailers such as Newegg and
amazon and moving these things at all
with prices currently more than 20% over
the MSRP further down the food chain we
find that the non k processors such as
the core i5 6400 6500 and core i3 are
selling at the MSRP making them much
more attractive options especially now
that they too can be overclocked given
current pricing and the recent ability
to overclock
any skylake processor we see no reason
to buy the 6600 K and 6700 K processors
they're for those in the budget looking
at moving into Intel's latest LGA 1151
platform be wise to invest in a
motherboard that supports non k
overclocking and pick up a processor
such as the 6400 or 6500 the next step
is to pair the right ddr4 memory with
the new skylake processor and with so
many options available this can be a
daunting task jumping over to new AG and
punching in ddr4 into the search box
immediately brings back 799 results so
time to narrow things down a little
assuming you're after a gigabyte kit
made up of two four gigabyte modules
which we believe is the sweet spot right
now then you instantly reduce your
options to just 123 prices star just $40
for a basic ddr4 2133 kit and go all the
way up to $400 for I imagine isn't
impossible to justify g.skill ddr4 4266
kid running timings of the slack as an
air support team I've put together a
table that breaks down the various
memory speeds that we'll be testing
along with their lowest and typical
asking prices finding ddr4 memory
clocked at just sixteen hundred and 1866
megahertz isn't easy and with 21 33
megahertz memory price so low
recommend avoiding it anyhow starting at
just $40 for nine gigabyte ddr4 2133 kit
isn't terribly expensive though just
five to ten dollars more lens 24 hundred
megahertz memory from there spending an
extra five to ten dollars each stare
pliers you a little over a ten percent
increase in memory frequency it is it
worth it and where do you reach a point
of diminishing returns that's what we
plan to find out for testing we'll be
using the 6700 K rather than an
overclocked tune on K processor for the
simple fact that it allows us to test at
standard memory speeds overclocking
generally results in non-standard memory
speeds our core i7 6400 overclocked for
example forces to run our ddr4 3000
memory at 29 86 megahertz for example
so rather than confuse the issue with a
heap of non standard frequencies we'll
be testing the 6700 K at nine of the
more common ddr4 memory speeds ranging
from 1333 megahertz up to thirty six
hundred megahertz now keep in mind zdi
four does officially start at 1600
megahertz the resulting figures will
still be relevant for those looking at
purchasing and much cheaper core i5
processor to overclock the snot out of
it the focus will be exclusively on
gaming performance and to extract the
most frames we'll be using the geforce
gtx 980ti
ddr4 1333 doesn't exist but we wanted to
test at this low frequency to provide a
better overall picture of how the sky
processor scale likewise you can also
scrub our ddr4 1600 and 1866 as these
are never cost-effective and
availability is poor so then starting at
ddr4 2133 we find a memory bandwidth of
just 27 gigabytes per second with our
6700 K processor moving to 20 400
megahertz memory improves the memory
bandwidth to thirty point seven
gigabytes per second we saw another big
jump to ddr4 2666 memory at thirty five
point nine gigabytes per second the jump
to ddr4 3000 was also quite large as the
bandwidth increased to 4.1 gigabytes per
second moving to 3200 megahertz
only provide an additional two gigabytes
per second and the same was family going
from 3200 megahertz to 3600 megahertz
Assassin's Creed syndicate isn't really
fazed by the system's memory
speed and we seem much the same
performance from ddr4 2133 all the way
to ddr4 3600 the frame time data
suggests much the same though the lowest
official spec memory being ddr4 1600
does come a significant performance
impact here like Assassin's Creed we
find the memory performance as little
impact on Batman Arkham Knight frame
rates in fact even less of an impact is
seen here is ddr4 1333 delivered similar
performance to ddr4 3600 the frame time
data reveals a similar performance trend
as well here we have yet another game in
battlefield 4 that shows no real
advantage to using higher clock ddr4
memory the frame time data also shows us
that it's really only the 1333 mega
Hertz configuration that shows a mile
drop-off in performance variety finally
we see some reasonable gains of
performance when using higher frequency
memory that said the gains run out at
around the 20 400 megahertz mark
suggesting this is the sweet spot for
black ops 3 looking at the frame time
data we see that the ddr4 2666 is the
sweet spot offering a reasonable gain
over the 20 400 megahertz memories back
when we first benchmark fallout 4 using
ddr4 3,000 memory we noticed a massive
drop in performance when using slower
memory modules such as those designed to
work at 2133 and 2400 megahertz
it seems for f4 can't get enough of the
high speed memory and we continue to see
solid gains all the way to 3,000 mega
Hertz the Train time data also shows a
continued improvement in performance
that the memory frequency is scaled up
Grand Theft Auto 5 reaches its limits
with ddr4 2400 memory just as black ops
3 deal the frame time data also shows
little difference between ddr4 1866 and
ddr4 3600 memory like fallout 4 we see a
constant performance improvement in Just
Cause 3 as the memory frequency is
ramped up that said the games aren't
quite as extreme although the
performance does continue to climb
there's just a 5 frame per second on
average
friends between ddr4 1866 ddr4 3600
frame time data reveals a similar
performance trended and again we're
gamers completely get away with 1866
megahertz memory interestingly when
testing with Rainbow six siege we find
that while the average frame rate does
increase from ddr4 1333 to ddr4 1866 the
minimum frame rate remains much the same
the frame time data suggests there's
very little to be gained in Ramah
succeed when using the higher clock ddr4
memory Star Wars Battlefront wasn't a
game that we expected to see much in the
way of performance gains from using
higher clocked memory this is exactly
what we found
shockingly there's almost no difference
between ddr4 1333 and ddr4 3,600 memory
in this title frame time data also
confirms there's nothing to be gained
from running high-speed memory in
battlefront finally we have the Witcher
3 Wild Hunt and here we see reasonable
performance gains all the way up to 2400
megahertz
where we eventually reach an average of
82 frames per second going all the way
up to 36 hundred megahertz next is just
one extra yes the frame time data also
suggests the dunia for 2400 is the sweet
spot in The Witcher 3 long before I
started Hardware unboxed I played around
with memory frequencies and timings on
Intel's Haswell platform back then I
found that ddr3 1866 was the sweet spot
though as the platform evolved ddr3 2400
eventually began to show reasonable
performance gains in a number of games
and applications for the most part the
memory frequencies won't make much of a
difference for gamers and the
bog-standard ddr4 2133 will serve you
well that said of the ten games tested
six of them saw a worthwhile advantage
when using 24 hundred megahertz memory
just two games benefited from even
faster memory and those two games of
Fallout 4 and Just Cause 3 all at four
in particular saw strong gains all the
way up to 3200 megahertz so that's
something to be aware of especially if
you play this game a lot although not
all games showed a performance game when
going from ddr4 2133 to ddr4 2400 with
just $5 separating these memory kids in
the 8 gigabyte capacity We strongly
suggest going with the faster memory
20 400 megahertz should really be the
base ddr4 clock speed for the most part
going you about 2400 megahertz is
necessary and we found that DDR for
3,000 kids cost an average $10 more
which obviously isn't a lot of money
especially when you're likely going to
be investing well over $300 in the cpu /
motherboard combo anyway going beyond
3000 megahertz we've reached the point
of diminishing returns for sure prices
increased sharply and this nerville
extra performance to be had there
forward depending on the retail price we
recommend a me fruitcake clocked at or
between 2400 and 3000 megahertz which
for a dual channel kit should set you
back anywhere from $45 to $65 thanks for
