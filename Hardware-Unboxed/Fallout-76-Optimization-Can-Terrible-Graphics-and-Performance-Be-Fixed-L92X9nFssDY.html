finally time to tackle fallout 76 on PC
again that I think is fair to say has
disappointed a number of Fallout fans
and it's not just because the game is a
technical disaster on both PC and
consoles but the game itself just hasn't
lived up to the fallout name judging by
harsh reviews from critics and even
harsher reviews from gamers personally
I'm a big Fallout fan and this
multiplayer only title is absolutely not
what I wanted from the next for that
game especially after fallout 4 what
does it add disappointing but in any
case there still seems to be a core fan
base for for that there's currently
playing and enjoying this game which is
good news because you really want other
players in the game world if you are
going to jump in and give it a try
anyway
this video isn't really about whether
fallout 76 is a good game it's about how
the game runs on PC and whether there is
anything you guys can do to get the game
running better so as you stand for these
videos we've benchmarked almost every
setting in the game to give you the full
breakdown of how each graphics option
impacts performance and what the
differences are in visual quality to get
the usual housekeeping out of the way
we've benchmarked this game on our core
i7 8700 K test rig overclocked to 4.9
gigahertz with 16 gigabytes of ddr4
memory and for this game we were only
able to use an NVIDIA GeForce r-tx 2080
for testing the reason for this is it's
very difficult to keep repeatable
benchmark runs in a multiplayer title
like for that 76 in fact the game
basically does everything possible to
make sure you can't do anything
consistently so it took much longer to
benchmark this game than most others
even something like a battlefield 5
multiplayer is easy to benchmark the
flat 76 so this severely limited the
amount of graphics cards that were able
to test now usual graphics comparisons
there are several reasons for this
firstly every setting in the game with
the exception of the fade sliders
requires a full restart of the game to
apply and not just a quit to the main
menu a full-blown restart and then on
top of that each time you load the game
you were sent into a different game
world which thanks to the dynamic
weather and time of day system could be
in completely different conditions - the
last time you
for testing we like the in-game
conditions to be as similar as possible
so this required a lot of quitting and
reloading the game to get into a world
with the same time of day and weather
but it's worse than that because once
you're in the game there's not a lot of
scope for positioning a benchmark run
long story short ends up committing
suicide hundreds of times so I could
restart each benchmark at the same spawn
point and sometimes my suicide attempts
would fail
yeah benchmarking this game wasn't a lot
of fun we just no doubt why steep
doesn't even want to touch it for a big
GPU benchmark after roaming around West
Virginia to find the most intensive
areas of the game actually settled on a
benchmark run just outside vault 76
which is basically where you start the
game with expansive views this is one of
the more stressful areas in the game
along with several other mountaintops
that stretched the game's draw distance
so how does for that 76 run well to be
frank like a steaming path of dog turns
I specifically waited a couple of weeks
to test for that 76 because I wanted to
give Bethesda a reasonable amount of
time to fix the early technical issues
that would know to help crop up I mean
this is a pathetic game using the
creation engine they were always going
to be a load of problems at launch but
as the game runs right now using version
10.1 or 14 it's pretty much a joke
apparently there are more patches in the
works but seriously this is not a game
that runs well and it's not a game that
looks good either so before I get into
the graphics comparison let's look at
all the problems with this game's
performance and presentation to begin
with the latest patch fixed the
long-running issue with the creation
engine that tied physics to framerate
previously when you uncapped your
framerate
in these games in-game physics would run
faster and for a multiplayer title this
would mean some players moving faster
than others depending on each player's
performance for Fallout 76 they
initially kept everyone to 64 FPS and
forced vsync on to prevent this being
exploited but with version 10.1 dot 14
that framerate limit has been removed
and physics are no longer tied directly
to framerate so you can play at 100 FPS
without essentially cheating now you
might be thinking that's a major step
forward for Bethesda finally there fixed
an issue with their engine that's been
around for 10 years or more
I mean it's pathetic
taken them this long but whatever
progress is progress however the game
still does not have a vsync toggle so by
default you will be kept to your
monitors refresh rate if you want to
disable vsync you have to edit the full
hat 76 press dot ini' file and add in I
present interval equals 0 yep you
actually have to edit an any file to get
this basic feature in the game but wait
it's worse than that the game does not
run well at high frame rates on our ITX
2080 test system the game was
consistently smooth running at 60 FPS
with vsync on but as soon as I turned
vsync off and start running the game
it's a 70 to 80 fps it's remarkably
choppy the game is smooth below 60fps
but there's something about breaking the
60 FPS barrier that this game does not
like did you think that was the only
issue with flat 76 is performance well
let me tell you about how the game runs
in general using an RT X 2080 at 4k
using the ultra preset I was getting
around 60 fps in the more intensive
areas up to maybe 80 fps in the best
areas but as low as 40 to 50 fps in
others so performance is a little better
than shadow of the Tomb Raider but
around the same markers battlefield 5
and hitman 2 just comparing it to some
recent other titles so on face value
that puts fallout 76 around the same
mark as other triple-a releases of 2018
a little less intensive than the top-end
titles and a little more intensive than
others but oh my god have you actually
seen how this came looks this is not a
good looking game that's being extremely
generous I'd say most aspects of this
game look like complete garbage Steve
says I'm not allowed to swear on the
channel there's a word that starts with
s and means fecal matter that comes to
mind we're looking at this game's
graphics the lighting system is perhaps
the most advanced aspect in that you can
get some nice bloom and God rays and the
game is a lot more vibrant then fallout
4 which makes exploring the world more
pleasant but basically nothing else
about the graphics have been upgraded
since fallout 4 a game that came out in
2015 and at the time looked pretty bad
it's been three years since fallout 4
and we're at the point where the
graphics are perhaps 5 to 6 years behind
what we've come to expect from modern
games the issues are plentiful the
folder system in this game is decidedly
last generation and considering most of
the game world is filled with trees and
grass it's hard not to notice even worse
than that at just the general object
structures items and everything else it
feels that the game world we're looking
at low geometry models that lack detail
most of which are reused from fallout 4
and often with low-quality textures the
material system in particular is not up
to scratch where modern games are
emulating the reflective properties of
dirt metals rocks and so on for their
lighting system in Fallout 76 basically
every element looks flat and again last
generation the shadow system is awful
I'll get into that more in a moment as
is the water simulation plus you get
typical Bethesda animations which are
janky to say the least even the map
which is basically just a 2d image
performs like rubbish when it shouldn't
and that's without mentioning the suite
of technical issues with quests and
keyboard controls on PC particularly for
menus that are like the person that
mapped these out has never played a PC
game ever before when you pair this
level of visual fidelity with
performance akin to a flagship triple-a
title in 2018 it's really hard to
swallow a game like battlefield 5 has
expansive open areas similar to parts of
the fallout seventy-six map yeah it runs
better than 476 for the most part and
looks at least a generation better in
the graphics department I also think of
an open-world game like Far Cry 5 or
even watchdogs 2 from 2016 and for that
76 is so far behind these titles at a
similar performance level it's almost
funny so the question then becomes can
we fix this game to deliver decent
enough performance that matches the
visual quality that were actually
getting and once again this is we have
full hat 76 disappoints because not only
are there very few graphics settings a
bunch of them barely do anything for
performance and visual quality here you
can see the game's presets roughly side
by side in our benchmark run and
honestly there's not a lot of difference
between ultra high and medium the
biggest changes come in subtle tweaks to
the lighting system including shadow
quality plus a few small differences to
draw distance it's really only when you
get to the low preset that you get
obvious reductions to shadow quality and
draw distance and this plays out when
looking at the performance difference
between the 4 presets in one of the most
intensive areas in 476 if you want to
improve performance in these air
dropping from ultra to high only sees a
4% boost to average frame rates while
moving to medium you'll get about 10%
more frames only when you get to low do
you see a jump of 25% and that's with
basically every setting except texture
quality set to its lowest value like
with hitman 2 this sort of scaling is
gonna hurt those with lower end GPUs
attempting to gain more performance if
you're hovering around 30fps for example
a 25% jump moving from ultra to low
isn't gonna get you above 40 FPS even if
you account for a generous 40 percent
jump as lower end cards tend to benefit
more from lower end settings for that 76
still isn't one of those games that
scales well for those with budget
systems the best games for scaling tend
to have at least a 50 percent
performance improvement from their
highest to lowest presets even
Assassin's Creed Odyssey which we
criticized for being poorly optimized
delivers a 70 percent performance uplift
moving from its ultra high to low preset
giving lower end gamers a chance to
enjoy the title I'll be it with poor
visuals moving into the individual
settings first up we have texture
quality which is straightforward and
remains on ultra for all four presets
this is really only a setting I'd
recommend changing if you are hitting
vram limits because there is a loss to
quality moving from ultra to high and
especially to medium then when you use
the low setting texture quality is very
poor and it's only using the low setting
that you'll see significant 5% boost to
performance the other three settings
don't impact performance significantly
on cards with plenty of memory water
quality is an interesting one because I
couldn't really spot many differences
between the three modes looking at the
rivers in fallout 76 it's a bit hard to
tell with the differences to the
lighting system in each shot but yeah
almost no changes if anything I'd say
the higher settings have slightly better
screen space reflections but we're not
looking at a significant difference in
terms of performance there is a bit to
be gained from reducing quality to
either medium or low relative to high
the quality of the water in this game
isn't great to begin with so honestly
turning this down to low to get around a
4% improvement to performance in water
heavy areas it's probably going to be
worth I'd also consider using medium if
you can spot a difference lighting
quality is one of the more demanding
settings in the game and visually
was hard to get some comparison shots
that really show the differences again
due to the dynamic time of day system
the game uses so these shots aren't
fantastic showing the differences but
basically it boils down to the level of
volumetric lighting bloom and godrays
low essentially has volumetric lighting
reduced to the point where it's almost
disabled while medium and high utilized
more of this effect in terms of
performance you get a big uplift of over
8% when you switch the lighting system
from high to low
however lighting is one of the only
effects in 476 that actually looks
somewhat decent so I try and avoid using
the low mode here otherwise the game
looks even worse
my preference used to use medium there's
not a huge difference between high and
medium visually but you get about 2% to
your performance making the switch
shadow quality is one of the weirdest
settings in fallout 76 it mostly governs
shadow resolution so how clean the edges
of Shadows are and how realistic they
look to start with Ultra seems to use a
heavy blur filter to the edge of shadows
in conjunction with a high shadow
resolution in real life shadows aren't
always defined and don't necessarily
have sharp edges but usually the level
of shadow softness is based on how far
the shadow is from the object some games
do use a realistic distance based shadow
system that accurately blurs shadow
edges where it should but fall at 76
isn't one of those games so using the
ultra shadow mode just leaves you with
blurry shadows to me the high mode
actually looks best here with more
shadow definition as the blur filter is
toned down then you get to the medium
and low modes which have less blurring
but also lower shadow resolutions in the
case of the low mode shadows are
extremely pixelated and look like utter
garbage there's also a lot of shadow
artifacting with the medium and low
modes it's really ugly as something that
haven't seen in many other modern games
in terms of performance again high is
looking like a solid choice because it
gives 4% more performance than ultra for
a quality improvement so that's a pretty
clear win right there meanwhile there's
not a lot of point using the medium or
low modes the quality downgrade is
significant for a fairly small
improvement to performance and one last
thing GLaDOS check out the way the game
renders shadows for static objects after
you move if like the game is using some
sort of 10
poor reconstruction foreshadows to
improve performance yet
performance is still bad and the shadows
are still really ugly it's kind of weird
stuff their shadow distance probably
doesn't do what you think it does your
fall at 76 there is a fairly obvious
transition where low-quality fire
shadows are swapped out for higher
resolution near shadows I was hoping the
shadow distance setting would increase
the radius where new shadows are loaded
which would make this transition less
obvious but no all the mode does is
determine where the shadows are rendered
for really distant objects see this
faraway Hill at the start of the
benchmark run well shadows are rented
for the trees using the high mode and
are not rendered using low and yeah
that's pretty much the main difference
there then performance difference
between all three modes isn't all that
large you stand again about two to three
percent switching to either the medium
or low modes my preference here is
medium it's hard to spot the difference
even in areas with expansive views yet
you gain three percent average frame
rate so I wouldn't bother with felow
setting here the final four settings are
all fade sliders which essentially
control draw distance but again they
probably don't do as much for visuals
and performance as you might be
expecting in particular the actor and
item fade sliders do almost nothing so
I'd recommend keeping those maxed out
the first big change is when using the
object fade slider which governs
elements like trees destroyed cars boxes
and you know the usual Fallout non
movable objects cracking this setting
down to the lowest points these draw
distances creep in slightly its most
noticeable up on tall Hills where you
have far view distance you'll often see
less trees on faraway Hills but the
difference is also visible with more
close-range environments while the
object fades sending doesn't improve
average frame rates in a significant way
does improve 1% lows where a middle
ground setting can give upwards of 5%
improvement to 1% lowest presumably as
fewer objects are loading into the game
at any one time
I'd recommend something around this
middle setting to get a smoother
experience but don't expect radically
better performance grass fade is a
similar story where higher settings
cause grass to appear further away and I
think this setting has more noticeable
pop in on lower settings so ideal you to
keep it as high as your system will
allow however you can gain a reasonable
amount of performance setting to the
lowest notch on the slider gaining 2%
average frame rates and 10% to 1
percent lows in our benchmark run so
that's every setting covered in 476 for
those that are looking to gain a bit of
performance without significantly
affecting visual quality I'd recommend
the following settings textures on ultra
water quality on low lighting quality on
medium shadow quality on high shadow
distance on medium and all the fade
sliders as high as possible except for
object fade which I've set to around 50%
with these settings you'll gain around
8% to performance for almost no
difference to visual quality it's not a
radical improvement been in the game
that runs like trash it's nice to tweak
things a bit to get those higher frame
rates what surprised me most about four
at seventy six or seven is that most
options have very little impact on
visual quality sure in a game that
already doesn't look great you probably
want most effects unable to squeeze the
absolute most out of this engine
visually but it's strange to see effects
like screen space reflections ambient
occlusion depth of field and motion blur
all permanently enabled I think having
the option to disable or tone down these
effects could greatly help performance
on lower end systems especially because
you're not going to gain much
performance just simply switching to the
low preset as it is but the reality is
the engine Bethesda is using perform at
76 the creation engine is well past its
use-by date it was past its use-by date
with fallout 4 in 2015 and in 2018 it's
basically gone green and blue with mold
it simply should be thrown in the trash
at this point there are just so many
aspects of this engine that are
fundamentally flawed or broken and I
really believe the developers that have
had to work with and patch up this
engine over the past decade to make
modern games that's it for this one next
game we'll be looking at is just course
for which is set to be officially
released in early December so stay tuned
for that one as always you can subscribe

94 at 76 because I'll probably never
play that game again but in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
