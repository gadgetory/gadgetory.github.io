big things for PC gamers as would
finally enable DirectX 12 gaming
following AMD's lead with mantle
Microsoft aims to provide console level
efficiency with closer to the metal
access to hardware resources and reduce
CPU and graphics driver overhead as was
the case with mantle most of the DirectX
12 performance improvements are achieved
through low-level programming which
allows developers to use resources more
efficiently and reduce single threaded
cpu bottlenecking caused by abstraction
through higher level api's this all
sounds really exciting but up until now
there hasn't been a Direct X 12 game
available to test these theories out
technically this still isn't at least
not officially however start off has
recently given those that pre-ordered
ashes of the singularity on Steam early
access to the game this is great news
for game as a reviewers ally as it keeps
us all a chance to check out an upcoming
DirectX 12 title there's even an
extremely detailed inbuilt benchmarking
tool to boot some tech sites managed to
get their hands on an even earlier build
of the game a few months ago and they're
finding sparked quite a lot of
controversy the results showed that
Nvidia Maxwell based GPUs were slightly
slower under DirectX 12 while AMD is gcn
enabled GPUs radically improved the
truth is somewhere in the middle as I'm
about to show invidious DirectX 12
performance isn't great in fact it's
actually bad given better results can be
hard under directx 11 but it's hardly
disastrous md's DirectX 12 games are
solid but they're nothing like the fifty
to seventy percent gain some loud and
proud AMD fans would have you believe
that being said let's move on for some
pre beta testing please note all
benchmarks were recorded using a core i7
6
700k processor and the latest drivers
from AMD and NVIDIA first let's look at
the DirectX 11 performance at 1080p to
establish a baseline things look mostly
is expected although i'd say that the
gap between the geforce and radiant
graphics cards is slightly larger than
normal keep in mind AMD doesn't perform
as well at 1080p it does at high
resolutions due to their driver overhead
it's been said that AMD hasn't done much
work to optimize their directx11 drivers
for ashes of the singularity they're
given what we're seeing here they are
mostly they're the DirectX 12 results
are far more competitive and while the
gtx 980 TI is still able to lead the
fury x it's just a single frame that
separates them the 390 x is also very
close to the 980 while the 390 is able
to leave the 970 behind now we're going
to compare the DirectX 11 and DirectX 12
results side-by-side as you can see in
video drops to 23 frames per second
under DirectX 12 which is troubling but
not the end of the world on the other
hand the Radian graphics cards pick up
to 23 frames which is great news for AMD
fans moving up to 40 and 40 p we see
that directx11 performance on the AMD
side does improve for example the 390 x
is now slightly faster than the gtx 970
that we've normally expected to be quite
a lot faster the DirectX 12 1440p
testing is very similar to what we saw
at 1080p with a minor decrease in frame
rate performance that being the case the
performance margins all remain much the
same comparing the 1440p directx 11 and
DirectX 12 performance side by side
again shows that while Nvidia drops to
23 frames per second AMD is able to
increase performance by single frame now
at 4k using directx11 we again find that
the 390 x is only able to match the 970
while the fury axe is only able to match
the 980 and what is an unlikely scenario
using DirectX 12 at 4k allowed the fury
ax to perform within one frame per
second of the 980 TI while the 390 X was
just two frames per second slower than
the 980 comparing the DirectX 11 and
DirectX 12 results side-by-side we once
again see the AMD makes a small step
forward while in video takes a step
backwards keep in mind all the GPU tests
were conducted with a core i7
700k processor this means the DirectX 12
will provide better performance games
over DirectX 11 with a slower processor
as we're about to see using the Radeon
r9 fury axe to measure CPU performance
at 1080p using the crazy quality
settings a few things become obvious
firstly the Intel skylake processors
don't benefit greatly from DirectX 12
with just one to two frames per second
extra being rendered which is what we
saw in most of the previous GPU tests
using the core i7 6700 k the AMD
processors however suffered massively
when using DirectX 11 partly due to
amd's driver overhead and sadly partly
due to the fact that amd's processes
just aren't that efficient however
DirectX 12 sweeps into saved a for AMD
or at least brighten it up a lot the
fx-9590 enjoys over fifty percent
performance gain to roughly match the
intel core processors likewise the older
phenom 2 x6 received a huge performance
bump and so did the a-10 7870 k apu
reducing the in-game quality settings to
the medium preset with MSA turned off we
see that the Intel skylake processors
are cast at 61 frames per second in
directx 11 however DirectX 12 affords
quite a lot more Headroom allowing the
6700 k to reach eighty four frames per
second with the GPU bottleneck remove
the Intel processors raise away from the
AMD processors even when using DirectX
12 running the same CPU test with the
GeForce GTX 980 TI we find very
different results particularly when
looking at the AMD processors while the
AMD processors were seen to be
significantly slower using DirectX 11
with the fury axe this wasn't the case
with the 980 TI where DirectX 11 and
DirectX 12 performance was very
comparable the AMD processors also
performed better when using the medium
quality settings with the 980 TI
similarly we find there's very little
difference between DirectX 11 and
DirectX 12 on the Intel processors when
comparing performance with the 980 TI
finally here we have the 980 TI in fury
DirectX 12 performance side by side
using the medium quality settings as you
can see the margins are roughly the same
which is great news for em
directx 11 performance didn't look
nearly as well balanced well that was
really interesting and there's a heap of
data to consider from what I would call
a preview at best especially given the
game is yet to enter the beta testing
stage one of the first things we should
discuss is why the Maxwell GPUs with for
the most part slower with DirectX 12
I'll be it only a few frame slower the
reason has to do with Maxwell's DirectX
12 support which is currently limited
despite an video claiming otherwise it
was discovered that the new asynchronous
compute feature doesn't work correctly
with Maxwell GPUs Maxwell doesn't
provide hardware asynchronous compute
support and is dead in video patch
supporting at the driver level which
comes at a performance cost as we've
just seen AMD's cards on the other hand
feature hardware-based asynchronous
compute in the gcn architecture which
can give them an advantage in directx 12
games as we also just saw so with
maxwell nvidia have been more focused on
directx 11 performance in to a certain
extent this makes sense most of the
games released while Maxwell remains
current will only use directx11 giving
them time to shift focus once DirectX 12
becomes more commonplace with AMD
gearing their gcn architecture towards
parallelisms they are better prepared
for DirectX 12 so they've taken a hit
and DirectX 11 titles the gcn
architecture requires a CPU to feed it
data and as we've seen this can create a
CPU bottleneck as directx 11 kernel
utilized 122 CPU cores for the graphics
pipeline this also has to include things
such as AI and physics this is why we
saw the AMD process is really struggling
in directx 11 when paired with the AMD
Radeon r9 fury apps while they've fared
much better with the GeForce GTX 980 TI
that being the case it's also important
to know which cpu is being used to GPU
benchmarking and then which GPU has been
used for CPU benchmarking when comparing
directx 11 and DirectX 12 performance
also games should be mindful that this
is just a single DirectX 12 game it's
unlikely to represent DirectX 12
performance as a whole as no small game
is expected to do so as is the case with
directx 11 gaming it's also very likely
that some DirectX 12 games will favor
AMD while others will favor in video
still if the early access version of
ashes of the singularity has shown us
anything it's the AMD and NVIDIA are
very competitive in directx 12 its
graphics card such as the GTX 980 TI and
fury ax worked with the one to two
frames per second of each other as
always we posted these graphs up in a
forum hardware inbox calm for anyone
that would like to take a closer look
without relying on the pause button
