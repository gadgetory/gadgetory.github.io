yeah helmet you need me go over her no
parable for George great Toro hey guys
and welcome back to hi we're unboxed as
we all know thin and light ultra
portable laptops are not gaming systems
focusing more on productivity
performance and battery life for workers
on the go these sorts of laptops aren't
equipped with enough integrated graphics
horsepower to take on today's popular
triple-a titles nimble machines like
ultra books instead leave gaming to
their big gaming laptop brothers which
trade off portability for pure discrete
GPU power while the integrated GPU in
most Ultra portables isn't anything
special that doesn't mean it's
completely useless it's actually
possible to game on an ultrabook it's
just a matter of choosing the game and
it's settings carefully such that it's
not too intensive for the 15 watt Intel
CPU in most low-power laptops with this
in mind I went and tested 31 games on my
Lenovo ThinkPad x1 carbon everything
from modern triple-a titles to older 2d
platformers to give you an idea of what
games are actually playable on modern
ultra portables the think that x1 carbon
I used here is the entry-level model
with an Intel KB like Core i5 7200 u
processor 8 gigabytes of RAM and a 1080p
display the i5 7200 u is essentially the
base model you seriously you'll find in
ultra portals with two cores four
threads and a base clock of 2.5
gigahertz with a boost up to three point
one gigahertz the integrated GPU is an
HD 620 with 24 execution units clocked
up to 1,000 megahertz all the testing
you'll see in this video is reflective
of the entry-level ultra portable
experience but of course you can find
laptops with more powerful CPUs like the
i7 7500 U which delivers around 5% more
graphics performance occasionally you
might see Ultra portables with iris +
graphics as well which use CP
like the i7 75-67 you with double the
GPU execution units but these laptops
are rare so our testing is largely
representative of most standard
ultrabooks
the first group of games I tested were
modern triple-a titles ranging from new
games like prey to titles like The
Witcher 3 from a few years back all of
these games were designed to be playable
on at least Xbox one console hardware
and all require some form of discrete
GPU to meet their minimum requirements
it wasn't surprising to discover that as
ultra portables don't meet the minimum
requirements to play any of these games
that none could be placed at a
reasonable quality level a number of
games do load at all games like The
Witcher 3 were plagued with horrendous
input lag that made the game completely
unplayable and every other title failed
to hit even 25 frames per second at the
lowest possible quality settings at a
mere 720p resolution so as a quick
example here's a look at me seriously
struggling to play fallout 4 and up to a
whopping 24 frames per second I guess if
I wanted a cinematic experience I'd go
through the new spider-man film but hey
instead you know I'm still here
benchmarking games and true how we unbox
fashion as for prade don't even bother
exploring tell us one because you'll be
stuck with the sub cinematic experience
at the lowest possible detail settings
so it's safe to say that if you're
trying to play a triple-a title released
in the past four years on a modern
ultrabook you're probably going to have
a bad time considering Ultra portables
can't really play modern games with much
success I decided to go further back and
intend to play a wide range of games
from 2004 Grand Theft Auto Sion dress
right up until 2013
Tomb Raider depending on the game in
question it may come as a surprise that
some of these titles are very playable
and ultra portable if you're willing to
sacrifice visual quality of all the
games I tested from 2013 and earlier
only two titles were largely unplayable
Alan Wake didn't launch at all while
Black Flag hovered under 30 frames per
second at the lowest settings every
other game though was playable I'll bet
often at the low
settings of 720p some of these older
titles like oblivion and GTA san andreas
were quite playable at 1080p while
surprised it again like Far Cry 3 was
comfortably playable at the lowest
settings at 720p if I can to look at me
zooming around the island of Far Cry 3
it's far from the previous experience at
720p with low detail settings but the
game runs reasonably smoothly on
something released just five years ago
skyrim fans looking for yet another
device to play the game on can actually
hit 1080p here at 35 to 45 fps and
that's a good choice consuming 720p
can't consistently achieve 60fps my
choice for the best experience of the
pack comes from its preceding title
though in Oblivion which runs at near
maximum settings in the 50 to 60 FPS
bracket so it's great to head back into
that outstanding game to get a nice head
of nostalgia I'm not a big fan of
eSports titles personally but I did load
three of the most popular ones onto the
ThinkPad x1 carbon to see if they were
playable on integrated graphics here are
the results of the three games the only
one I'd say isn't playable is csgo as
you really want to play above 60 fps
which integrated graphics simply cannot
hit it's better news for both overwatch
and rocket League though as overwatch is
playable on the lowest possible settings
if you're willing to put up with the
occasional dip low 60fps in heavy combat
while rocket League achieves 60fps
without much issue at 900 P none of
these tiles manage to hit in native
1080p but two of three being playable at
lower resolutions is a good result
nonetheless there are two categories of
games that are almost always playable on
low-end hardware like Ultra portables
with integrated graphics indie titles
and 2d games games are bought into
either of these categories tend not to
be particularly graphically intensive
relative to modern triple-a titles so
most can be enjoyed on laptops work with
games from before 2013 most of these
semi modern indie titles are very
playable on ultra portable Hardware the
experience some of these titles isn't
ideal games like Bastion and Ori and the
blind forest would be better at 60fps
but can't manage that level of
performance on integrated graphics and
have limited if any graphics settings
others like stardew valley
are perfect for WIC laptop hardware so
you see though check out our in the
blind forest on laptop hardware this is
a gorgeous game that will blow you away
on integrated graphics FTL is a personal
favorite of mine as it runs
fantastically and doesn't obliterate
your battery in the process which is to
be expected from a mere two year game
while ultra portables aren't as suited
to gaming as true gaming laptops it's to
possible to play a wide variety of games
on the slow integrated graphics you'll
find inside you may not be able to hit
the best quality level of all the
highest frame rates but setting games to
the lowest preset and resolution can
deliver decent playable results of the
eight mantra play titles I tested none
were playable
however 10 of 12 triple-a games from
2013 or earlier could be played at low
detail settings with 5 of those 10
running comfortably at 1080p 2 titles
oblivion and GTA san andreas run at near
maximum quality settings eSports titles
were easier to run the modern triple-a
games with both overwatch and rocket
League hitting acceptable frame rates at
low detail settings csgo was unplayable
but only because it couldn't hit
consistently or over 60 FPS the best
category of games though as I mentioned
earlier are the 2d and indie titles of
the 8 games I tested only one failed to
hit a consistent 30 frames per second
brothers a tale of two sons while every
other title ran reasonably well
including newer 3d games like the
witness the final tally of games stands
as follows of the 31 games I tested 19
ran and were playable on the core i7
7200 u 7 of these games only run at
resolutions below 1080p while 9 needed
to be run at the lowest possible detail
settings 7 games though ran at near
maximum settings though five of those
seven were indie titles that's a
surprisingly good result for hardware
that's known to struggle playing 3d
games the lowest detail settings may not
look the prettiest but heading into
Skyrim on a laptop is still an enjoyable
experience if you don't have proper
gaming hardware available anyway that's
it for this look at ultra portable
gaming I hope you guys work something
and now know exactly what you can play
on your cable a power ultra portable if
