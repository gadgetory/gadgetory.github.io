this is part two of our March Q&amp;amp;A part
one was probably on the channel
yesterday if I could have been bothered
to get around to editing it so go back
and check that out to get part one of
all of our questions and well we've got
another I probably say 20 to 30 minutes
worth of questions to cover in this
episode so a batch to get through yep
can't be deadly deadly around straight
to it
next question another pretty good one
here it was heavily upvoted why is
everyone so excited about 16 cause and -
even when eight cause is more than
enough for modern gaming well I'd say
probably one of the main reasons is that
you guys don't just game or a lot of you
I suppose a lot of you are just game but
a lot of people don't just game for
example well Tim and I both really enjoy
gaming and that's why our content is
very focused on gaming we also like
video editing which needs more cause 16
causes a massive benefit over eight
there I think as well just helps to push
down the pricing of all of the tiers
especially the ones that are more you
know cost-effective for gaming so your
six score and eight core CPUs are going
to hopefully become cheaper if that's 16
core CPU is introduced that means that
you guys instead of having to buy like a
ninety nine hundred K to get that top
end gaming performance you could buy a
AMD's mid-range process if that's what
the lineup looks like yeah I think
that's one of the reasons why people are
so excited by the Zen to rumors and
leaks that we've seen so far because
they're claiming very affordable six
core parts which may happen be great if
it does but that ties in with what Tim's
saying is when you get a lot more cause
up top mate it's unlikely they're going
to charge over $1000 well they're
already not doing that on the thread
Ripper platform yeah that's right so it
stands to reason that a 16 cores enter
part will be reasonably affordable
possibly around the $500 marks that
would make sense and a guess don't hold
me to that we don't have any information
okay we've got another console each
related question since Tim is a resident
console gamer apparently well you've got
a console and I do so by default you are
is it then console gamer why
why console Hartwell why is console
hardware made by AMD and not by Intel
and NVIDIA so Tim shoot yeah so well I
mean AMD sort of has that one-stop
solution for everything you can get your
CPU and your GPU and that's the two main
components that really other companies
are offering so make sense it's just I'm
certain that it makes the whole process
of getting those chips much easier
either deal with two companies you with
one time the one die it's easy so that
is a big benefit for AMD at the moment
potentially with Intel getting back into
more powerful a GPU hardware that they
could be an option in the future as well
depending on on how they go with nvidia
only really offering their GPUs only but
that said the Nintendo switch does use
an NVIDIA ARM based SOC so we don't
really hear a lot about their ARM
processors anymore because in the video
is mostly using those for their car
related stuff but certainly they did at
one point have you know not the most
powerful thing we're certainly a mobile
class associate that had arm CPU cores
in their own GPU in there so yeah
there's a lot of solutions out there but
it's simply because AMD seems to be
offering the best overall package that
they can they could win over the console
makers at the moment yeah they would
definitely be exploring all our options
and it seems like Amy's the best option
likely the most cost-effective and I'm
not sure Intel will come in there and
muscle them out of that one any time
soon all right I'll probably answer this
one since I do most of this testing will
you ever test entry-level aib cards
instead of the high-end ones I'm pretty
sure that most of us don't buy those
ones so I'll just address this a bit
more other question that's the the bulk
of the question though so I would love
to
and we took we've talked about this with
our patreon members a few times because
they've asked the same question and if
we've really got to get to a point where
we can afford to buy a few of these
graphics cards each time they come out
because the companies we work with they
similar just refused to send out or at
least their edge q refuses to send them
out because they want their you know
their flagship card they want to see you
know if it's a gigabyte card or and a
sue
card or MSI they want their best foot
forward the best showing so they're not
going to send they're really cheap
budget model with their base cooler even
if that makes sense to buy even if it's
a better value card and we would
probably give it a better review they
want the card that's going to have the
lowest operating temperature the best
overclocks the best out-of-the-box
performance all that stuff so yeah we've
really got to buy them and you guys
might think we'll just buy them sounds
easy enough but yeah it costs thousands
of dollars to buy multiple cards likes
but I don't even know how much is the
1662 and Australia probably around $400
or something I'm just guessing so you
buy three of those and that's $1200
spent so so support us on patreon and
then maybe in the future we'll be able
to do more we do buy a lot of hardware
and I was contemplating but for the next
release the 1650 I may just buy base
model gigabyte a Suisun MSI card or
whoever else I can get my hands on and
we'll do that and we'll do do that stuff
from time to time but we also have to
buy camera gear and all can't teams just
spend many thousands of dollars on you
camera geared up is b-roll game so yeah
it is what it is next question
love this one short sharp get to the
point will the 1052 I get a price cut
I'm just gonna simply answer that in the
same fashion the question was asked know
what do you reckon
just get phased out of the market it'll
get phased out if anything it'll
actually increase a bit in price as it
goes out and yeah that's pretty much
that one so the only way you're gonna
get a cheap 10:50 eye is if you get it
well possibly on sale but usually
secondhand but really I wouldn't even
bother with the 1052 outs sorry much
slower than an RX 570 and they're down
are like a hundred and twenty dollars
it's insane you get two games with those
yeah yeah yeah I just go get yourself an
hour X 5 sets almost like you buy the
games and then you get the GP for free
in that in that sense yes you do yep
it's there amazing the prices of those
things at the moment so yeah I'd be
snapping up an RX 570 or an IRS 580
alright Steve what do you reckon about
this one why don't you cover any custom
water-cooling PC tech on your channel
you always have that awesome custom loop
behind you step but you don't seem to do
much with water cooling on the channel
yeah okay it's a fair enough question I
have I think probably a few reasons
first of all I'm not super passionate
about the liquid cooling and all that
kind of stuff it's enjoyable and fun I
it's kind of gimmicky I think is the
best way to probably gonna upset the car
well it's it's not a where a value
Channel right and it's not a value yeah
it's not at all practical so it looks
amazing it's a lot of fun if you like
that hands-on stuff but to recommend it
to you you first need a crapload of
money that that's very important then
you need to be super into your PC and
super into PC maintenance because it's
not like you build it looks glorious and
there you go that's just going to look
glorious for the next few years you've
got to do coolant flushes clean the
parts so if something goes wrong you've
got to rip the whole thing down maybe
you have to you know it might have taken
you two days to do all those hard true
bends and whatever and then you know you
have to either take them out try and
clean them or they get stained and then
you've got to do it again things get
corroded things fail things leak and
then you've got to do a lot more
cleaning
so yeah you really it's kind of like I
suppose I liken it to guys that are into
cars so you know you just want to car
take up the track and have a bit of fun
there's those guys and if a breaks down
you get someone else to deal with it and
then those guys would just pull them
apart and change every little thing or
rebuild every little thing and I have
fun doing it so if you're that kind of
guy with cars then that's yet you need
to be that kind of guy for computers you
need to just be willing if something
goes wrong and it's a massive headache
then water cooling is not for you but if
the if if the idea of having to do a
whole flush and pull everything apart
and clean it meticulously is gets you
all excited then go for your water
cooling but yeah it's just really
expensive and impractical so I don't try
to push it too much because people will
get the wrong idea and think that we're
look so amazing and the performance must
be amazing and I'm going to get that
you've really got to be yea willing to
deal with all those shortcomings as well
make sense you someone who hasn't done
too much of it I totally agree that's
why they're doing usually yeah that much
yeah
alright next question I'll answer this
one pretty quickly it wasn't that
heavily uploaded but raisin wife
question can you overclock the Athlon
200g higher than 3.8 to 3.9 gigahertz
with an arrow and forcing voltage so for
those of you that don't know msi went
and unlocked overclocking of the Athlon
200 GE just calls and gigabyte and
everyone else followed suit so you can
overclock it they generally only do
about 3.8 some of the better ones do 3.9
it's not a heat related problem that's
just a silicon limitation so strapping
on an i/o that costs two or three times
what the CPU costs and running he
evolved you sure it won't really help
you it'll do what it'll do pretty much
with a sort of a wraith cooler on it so
yeah our PSU wattage requirements for
the from graphics card manufacturer is
the absolute minimum or just a guideline
can use a scale maybe 50 watts Laura and
still be on the safe side well again
comes to power supply efficiency which
is what we talked about in an earlier
question probably in part one by this
point 50 watts lower Shore you'd get
away with that no worries you could
probably go 100 watt slower with a
efficient unit but they're they are very
much a guideline so yeah I'd buy them if
you can generally go higher it usually
doesn't cost you too much money but yeah
if you're 50 watts under then you'll get
away with that perfectly fine oh another
question here for Tim God when will 3rd
gen Rison nearly forgot the crucial bit
they're rising for the desktop launch
well will 3rd gen rise and launched him
go kind of tell you it's like two to
three months I guess guess being a
crucial word they're moving on I
finished rolling Tim for the moment both
of you blinked twice at the same time if
you received an AMD search and I didn't
even know this was the next question CPU
and other CPUs good so what are we going
to do you blink yeah it seems very
complicated because
like this already blink so you turn it
up no we do not have samples yet no
media have samples yet and a guess I
would say were a few months away still
from getting samples but anybody could
ring me up next week and go samples are
on the way but yeah it's not gonna
happen I don't think two or three months
probably around Computex time so so the
reason the 99 are okay ends up getting
so hot is not only because the dye is
bigger but the actual board the dye
arrests on is also thicker it's actually
the dye itself there anyway yeah thus
increasing temperatures to the level
that not even liquid metal can fully
dissipate by itself you've got to stay
on the diet down yo yo yo where is this
going with that my log of a sentence out
of the way we skipped a bit sorry do you
think it's time Intel rethinks their
manufacturing process to make sure that
their CPUs can be reasonably cooled with
an O at 5 gigahertz especially if they
for some reason still can't get their
next gen at 10 min or get to 10
nanometer it's a hard one a touch to
cover because they've obviously done
what they've done because they had to so
if they make the the silicon on top of
the the cause and whatnot if they make
that thinner apparently they risk
cracking that when they do when they do
the solder in process and then if they
make the solder thinner that can crack
over time from heating up and expanding
and so I don't know they've it's it's
weird because they seem to have done it
before but I haven't looked into the
various arguments with this because I
haven't really cared too much but maybe
an argument would be that the older CPUs
where they did this well they could say
that they cracked but I don't think they
did but they could just argue they're
not putting out nearly as much heat so
your thermal expansion attraction
there's not as extreme maybe that's a
reason but yeah they do need to rethink
things well I don't really need to
rethink things I just need to get to a
new process
yeah that's basically it there were
never planning to have this situation
where they were pretty value that yeah
struggles with thermals its yeah you
know the things get delayed and this is
what they've ended up well a double
whammy I don't think they ever expected
rise and the come out and be as good as
it is especially in terms of value a
cause the price that AMD can happily
offer it for and yet getting stuck on
their current process node is just not
ideal even though it does do quite well
but they will need to move on
at some point anyway that's that one
okay the priest asks I have a friend
that's been nagging me all day about how
he wants a laptop but doesn't actually
need the portability and he wants to
game on it of course I'm trying to
convince him just to build a PC I'll
even help him assemble it the question
at a fixed given price tag is it
preferable for gaming of like content
creation to get a PC or a laptop if you
don't need mobility well someone has
reviewed a lot of gaming laptops most of
this is if you don't need the mobility
you should definitely get a desktop yes
the whole point of getting a gaming
laptop is that you can take it around
you can move it about its complement
compact but a lot of them are compact
enough that yeah you can you just have
your one PC that you take wherever you
want to go you can do gaming whatever if
you aren't going to move it around so
mobility isn't an issue then you'll get
much better value for money building a
PC not only are the names as we've I've
been talking about a lot my gaming
laptop reviews not only of the names of
GPU is not actually reflective of the
desktop performance so you think you're
getting in RTX 2060 but you're actually
getting like gtx 1660 performance you
get yeah they're just so much more
expensive for that level of performance
i'm sorry even say a well built desktop
would be half the cost yes a laptop yep
for a given level of performance so and
of course a desktop has a whole range of
performances that you actually can't get
out of any laptop form factor well the
oil based reasonable laptop if you don't
like if you don't need the mobility the
list of advantages that a desktop PC
offers
it's massive longer than your arm so you
have as Tim said significantly better
performance for a lower cost so that's
just one you have much better upgrade
ability if something breaks you don't
have to junk the entire unit much easier
to expand and add things like storage
you can what else is there there's so
many things you can have a way better
monitor your range of monitors is
significant better generally laptop on
and luxury garbage yeah much quieter way
in gaming the list just goes on better
keyboard of course you can attach a
keyboard on my own in general your mouse
stuff it so me man
it's significantly better on all fronts
really apart from being out of pick it
up and move it somewhere else
yeah and that's why I've never
understood those massive chunky like
your 17-inch mega chunky laptops it's
like that isn't portably why why does
that exist when you could just you can
even build a slim ish desktop system
like a small form-factor or something
like that and it just makes so much more
sense than that particular product that
said at the same time I'm not saying the
gaming laptops of bad products because
certainly especially the thin and light
ones yeah you're paying a lot of money
but the level of performance you can get
from something that's this thin portable
is very impressive and certainly for us
content creating a Computex for example
that's the exact sort of thing we want
to take we might have desktops I'm
taking a desktop this year be much
better but anyway if it's really all
about the portability if you're not
taking advantage of the portability that
it makes absolutely no sense at all the
other advantage of the have is they have
a built-in UPS but you can just buy a
decent UPS for very little money these
days and it will serve the same purpose
if you're worried about losing wherever
you're at when a power you know power
outage yeah so I think we've Pro very uh
yep pretty much covered that one we'll
move on there's a top nice topic or
question consuming I think this was just
announced so what is your opinion about
Google's stadium what do you think about
licensing all those games all the
different platforms will Google have
likely only 10 to 15 triple-a titles in
their offer I mean it's hard to say what
the license
situation is because I don't think
Google has really announced their lineup
or pricing yet it's it's hard to it's
hard to really know you know will they
what were their triple-a selection be
like you know what publishers they're
working with what will their game range
be but I'm assuming you'll be some sort
of subscription thing so that is one
concern but for me that's not really the
main concern of this sort of thing my
main concern is the latency which is a
fundamental issue with game streaming
and while it does seem like Google is
promising to have the best handling of
this issue that than any other solution
that's come before it's still an issue
and from all the game streaming that
I've personally tried and I have a good
internet connection here it's just the
latency is bad it's just it's especially
for a wide variety of games like your
racing games your first-person shooters
of any kind the latency is just killer
yeah and it's something that you
fundamentally cut change because even if
I stream games in my own house from my
PC through my router to a different
device the latency for like a game like
fortnight is bad
so latency on your own local device is
always an obstacle that we're trying to
overcome yeah so a PC gaming has a big
advantage for latency over even console
gaming yeah like we ever run a high
refresh rates being able to turn off
things like facing can double buffering
and all that massively improves your
latency so then have all that stuff and
then add on your internet latency as
well it just is making this situation
where I just and from it seems like a
lot of people who try as well this
situation really I don't think that that
problem has been solved and that's the
problem that needs to be solved before
this solution will ever be good and
they're talking about is like future of
gaming and yeah it might be but they
need to actually genuinely solve that
problem first I think so well what's my
opinion without having tested it and
seen it and see if it delivers what they
they say it can do my opinion is it's
going to be a fantastic service and it's
gonna be amazing fee casual gamer pretty
console type gamers now if you're
playing Assassin's Creed which is their
demo again sure I think for casual
gamers it's going to be a game changer
or has the potential to be but for most
of you watching this who take you your
gaming quite seriously you want the best
graphics that you possibly can have high
resolutions you know all that kind of
stuff then it's really not going to
appeal to you but that would probably
put you in the minority of gamers as the
industry grows there's a lot more casual
gamers now and there are like super
serious guys I suppose I don't know I
don't really have the statistics but
yeah I think it's definitely going to
change it'll probably be a real
competitor for console gaming rather
than PC gaming I think yeah I'm not I'm
not a hundred percent convinced about
how it will go against console gaming
even because I still think that
especially with the move to consoles
like the ps4 pro and Xbox one X in
particular but there has been more of a
movement towards getting a really high
quality gaming experience in terms of
your this service will evolve though
whereas the consoles once they come out
they're stuck there for like a decade
yeah I sort of understand I just think
that you know people have tried this
solution before yeah it's been it's been
an option with GeForce now for example
yeah infrastructure is a massive problem
with everyone's gigabyte or gigabyte
whereas barrel will be out overcome I
think a google has the best opportunity
to overcome it I'm not sure whether they
actually will be able to you know that's
the most fair that's I think that's an
any question so yeah I said that's it on
the console I still think that a lot of
people prefer the home solution like
buying your box your honor your games
locally but we'll see we'll see how
we'll see how it evolves yeah we'll see
okay we have a question here from Nick
one of our loyal patreon members who's
been with us for a long time and he asks
the prices of AIB 2082 eyes are starting
to drop below EFI or pricing in
Australia so I'm considering buying one
if it were your money would you buy a
twenty atti now or are we close enough
to 7 nanometre G pre-production that
you'd save money for a 30 atti
well this is one of those questions we
were joking about before I kinda need
you know what you're coming from and if
you're hating life with what you've got
but then I suppose you wouldn't have
anything to rubbish if you're thinking
of buying a 28 you see especially in
Australia imagining that you have a
decent GPU like a GTX 1080 or Vega 6402
either no I definitely would not crowed
it's way too much money for what it is I
would wait thirty atti
who knows but yeah I would definitely be
waiting till next year make do with what
you've got now play on slightly lower
settings if you have to but yeah I mean
ultimately that's the decision that you
have to make yeah personally if it was
my money I would wait what would you do
with your money yeah I mean again like
you say it does depend the situation
because you probably are facing like a
you wait 43082 i I mean depends what
narvi the situation with na'vi is but
again hard to say there so yeah if we're
talking about a year way it does
massively depend on what your yeah as I
said in the last Q&amp;amp;A I'm gaming with
Vega 56 at the moment and I'm perfectly
happy with it I do a little bit of
resolution downscale and all that sort
of stuff and tweak the quality settings
following Tim's guides and things like
that and I'm playing on a 4k monitor so
obviously I'm not playing at native 4k
but it's fine and I have the option
there of dropping in a spare 20 8200 if
I want to but I don't really feel the
need I don't game a whole lot obviously
but yeah from memory Nick does have one
of those 4k 144 Hertz monitor okay in
which case I'm assuming that you're
maybe have a bit of money to throw
around if you're buying that sort of
monitor so in that case then maybe if
you're facing that year long wait you're
a really high-end PC gamer then maybe
you could justify spend that money on
the twenty-eighth yeah it's it's very
expensive yeah it's hard to know exactly
what you want as I said I'm quite happy
with Vega 56 at the moment I don't
really feel the need to get anything
more powerful it every game I play runs
perfectly fine I'm happy to do a little
bit of tweaking here and there so yeah
everyone's a bit different there all
right silence game asks again from our
discord chat what do you guys think of
eye tracking hardware like Toby are you
interested in that
stuff and if yes when you have spare
time can you do a review I've used eye
tracking once or twice ever and it just
is a gimmick from what I've used I mean
it just used it so like as for reviewing
it this just game support isn't good
enough and the things that I would I
actually found it annoying to play with
eye tracking enabled because it does
stuff like you you look at the left side
of the screen and your character shift
its movement to the left side I'm so
used to playing with controlling my
character's view from the mouse and
keyboard or controller that having my
eyes do it was really unnatural and hard
to sort of work with so for me I just I
just don't think it's worth it at all
it's kind of cool her racing car games
maybe yeah like I think if you had say a
multi screen setup like you were big
into surround yet maybe three ultra wide
models or something and you could really
look around and stuff in the network
yeah
and so but yeah again if you have the
ultra wide monitors you would just be
looking at the difference since you
wouldnt have to move around maybe change
the fisheye or something would be
convenient but yeah yeah so I just don't
think that it offers anything that
unique or important to have in gaming
which I guess is why hasn't really been
widely adopted mhm okay we have a
question here from Airbus a320 200
obviously this must Alex must be the guy
that's in the flight simulators it keeps
asked me to benchmark and sorry I
haven't but anyway hey guys today I
would like to request a relax request an
explanation of what dual channel RAM it
means I've heard you guys mention it
quite a few times yep and what qvo SSDs
Cheers
alright well jool channel Ram is not
single channel or AM helpful he's going
to elaborate
all right well back in the days when
dinosaurs used to roam we had single
channel memory and by adding another
stick of memory running them in dual
channel you can effectively double the
available bear
it's kind of like a raid zero but for
memory modules there's more wires so you
can run yeah more memory access yeah so
yeah the the seat back in the days
actually enough if we had jewel child
memory back in the days of chipset
memory controls I think we did anyway it
doesn't matter it's irrelevant but as
long as the memory controller supports
dual channel memory then you can use it
so people like guys that are new to this
get a little confused they think dual
channel memory is just having two memory
modules which isn't the case and then
obviously as we saw with the verge PC
bill that really depends on which slots
the memory is in to enable dual channel
operation but it's just a really good
way of effectively increasing memory
bandwidth which then speeds up
everything yeah the CPU effectively has
two taps on it single channel memory
you're only attached one hose to one one
tap you have dual channel memory your
touch both hoses you get more output so
it's just generally beneficial as we qvo
SSDs I believe that's Samsung's new
entry-level range of SSDs so that use
qlc memory which is the quad lower
quadrant so four bits per cell yep
so they have sort of the lowest
performance but very affordable to make
so because they're very high density so
yeah that's what a cute cube vo
assisting and they're supposed to say
couvreux q vo I'm not sure but yeah I've
actually got one haven't looked at it
yet pamorah budget so I haven't looked
into it too much but basically SLC was
the original technology and that's
single layer so one bit per cell and
then we got mlc which was multi-level
which was two and then we got TLC which
was three and now we've got four so that
basically just got to a point where the
technology is matured enough they will
survive that kind of the endurance
ratings have improved so much they can
do that now back in the day that would
have killed your SSD pretty quickly but
they're just as I said matured and
evolved and now that is a thing that's
possible yeah it seems like they're a
decent option for say a not a high
performance task but just like a large
game library considering I think Samsung
makes quite a four
one-and-two terrible models yep you can
very easily check your entire game
library on something like that get
decent performance you're not gonna get
blazing fire speeds but certainly good
enough for game loading well those solid
drives mostly are these probably limited
by the interface there anyway yeah 500
megabytes per second raid rights pretty
much what you can do there say they're
probably pretty useful secondary Drive
selecting a Steam library or something
but yeah if you want to know more about
them check the reviews what they'll like
is boot drives yeah I've got one I just
haven't got her
testing it out yet all right that's it
much Q&amp;amp;A no it's all done
all right it was a pretty successful Q&amp;amp;A
episode as it well usually is I don't
think we've had any epic fails as far as
their queue times have gone so well
we'll give ourselves a pat on the back
here that one I'm sure we did a great
job yeah really good questions from you
guys as well as Steve mentioned the
start of part one I think it was we do
post the places where you can ask your
questions on the YouTube community tab
sometimes on Twitter and also in our
discord chat which you can access
through our patreon page that's where
you can ask our new questions for these
episodes so yeah if you're wondering
about that we don't tend to get them
from the YouTube comments on these
episodes no we get a lot of comments on
these episodes saying where do I ask my
question as to said community page keep
an eye on that yeah I'll keep refreshing
it you've got about 30 days to get it
right yep and then get your questions in
for next month's episode what else I
think we've covered everything the whole
patreon stuff that we usually say you
know it's subscribe to the channel we
always like it when you guys do that I
think Tim's doing a job with this outro
comes up you know if you like the video
that helps sometimes that don't do those
and well I guess we'll catch you in the
next one I'm your host Dave I'm your
host Tim</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
