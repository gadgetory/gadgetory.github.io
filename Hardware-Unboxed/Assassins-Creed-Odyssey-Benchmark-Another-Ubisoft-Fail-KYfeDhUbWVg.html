got another big benchmark video for you
guys seriously why can't they just
release these games a little bit further
apart do they not understand how long it
takes to install 50 something graphics
cards in a test system anyway on hand
today for testing is the new Assassin's
Creed Odyssey game which like last
year's Assassin's Creed origins and Tom
Clancy's Ghost Recon wildlands and for
honor its built upon the amble next 2.0
game engine now the engine is quite old
now and it is starting to show its age
at least it is in our opinion but I'll
go over that and talk more about it once
we've looked at all the performance
figures now just quickly for those of
you unfamiliar with this title
Assassin's Creed Odyssey is an action
role-playing game developed by Ubisoft
Quebec and published by Ubisoft it marks
the 11th major installment and the 20th
overall in the Assassin's Creed series
and as I just mentioned it's the
successor to 2017 Assassin's Creed
origins set in the year 431 BCE the plot
tells a fictional history of the
peloponnesian war players choose between
controlling a mercenary for either the
delian league led by athens or the
Peloponnesian League led by Sparta for
testing or using the built-in benchmark
and normally I do avoid these canned
benchmarks but the version provided here
appears to deliver a good job of
representing demanding gameplay of
course we haven't had 10 hours up our
sleeve to play a good way through the
game to work out where the demanding
scenes are and Tim says this is actually
a very long game so obvious reasons it
just makes more sense now to use the
built-in benchmark we may change that
down the track but anyway these results
will be easy for you to compare to your
system and advantage to using this
built-in benchmark is that it's highly
accurate due to its kin nature for
testing I'm using the very high quality
preset at 1080p 1440p and 4k this is a
step down from the ultra high quality
preset which I will show some results
for later in the video but we decided
not to use that preset as it is just way
too demanding and offers very little in
the way of improved visuals as you're
about to see even the very high preset
is incredibly demanding so many of you
will probably want to try high
even medium as a bonus I have retested
some of the current and previous
generation mid-range GPUs along with
some even older models with the medium
quality preset at 1080p later this week
Tim will be putting together a detailed
Assassin's Creed Odyssey optimization
guide so if you are struggling with this
title that will probably be worth
keeping an eye out for also as a side
note I'm not a big fan of role-playing
games but Tim is and he suggests that
most gamers will be happy with around 40
to 50 FPS on average as this is very
playable for this type of game
especially if you have an adaptive sync
monitor I typically play racing games
and shooters so 60 plus FPS really is a
muster there so I'll make my
recommendations based on the information
provided by Tim as usual our course a
GPU test rig built inside the crystal
570 X has been used and it comprises of
a core i7 87 or K clocked at 5 gigahertz
with 32 gigabytes of ddr4 3400 Vengeance
memory for the Radeon GPUs I'm using
adrenalin Edition 18.9 point 3 and for
the GeForce GPUs driver version 4 1174
stop we have the previous generation
GPUs at 1080p using the very high
quality preset and quite shockingly not
a single GPU achieved 60 FPS on average
even the Maxwell Titan X fell short with
just 58 fps and a 1% low of 41 FPS for
just over 40 FPS on average you will
require the fury X or GTX 970 mind you
the older AMD GPUs aren't performing
very well in Odyssey that said they did
perform quite poorly in Origins as well
moving to 1440p and we see it's almost a
complete write-off with previous
generation hardware which again is very
shocking to see the Titan X in 980ti
we're very playable but short of that it
feels very laggy you could possibly get
away with the GTX 980 or fury X but
honestly I'd rather play with the low
quality preset enabled and then deal
with frame dips below 30 I could have
just skip to this testing to be honest
obviously no previous generation GPU can
handle this title at 4k using their very
high quality preset so let's just move
on to the current generation GPUs to see
how they do
ok so if you're wanting to say above 60
fps at 1080p you'll require a Pascal
titin GTX 10 atti or an RT X 2080 series
GPU so that's kind of insane at 1080p
for an average of 60 fps Vega 56 or the
GTX 1070 will be required then for
around 40 fps on average you'll need an
Rx 580 or preferably in this title the
GTX 1060 again we see in video offers
much better performance than AMD in
Odyssey jumping up to 1440p where no
previous generation GPU was able to
average 60 fps we see that this is just
achieved by the GTX 1080 although we do
see similar 1% low performance with the
top 5 GPUs the Pascal Titan X and up
were able to deliver much better average
framerate performance the GTX 1060 does
quite well also but ideally you'll still
want Vega 56 or a gtx 1070 both of which
are offered very similar performance at
this resolution there at 4k we find
playable performance for the r-tx 2080
titan x GT X 1080 Ti and RT X 20 atti
not amazing performance but certainly
playable as usual the RT x 20 80 TI was
the standard here managing 60 FPS on
average they remember we're only using
this a second highest quality preset
using the highest quality preset and
shadow of the Tomb Raider soared 25%
more performance at this resolution ok
so here's all the GPUs tested at 1080p
using the very high quality preset and
it's quite shocking to say how many
failed to deliver just 30 FPS on average
half of the GPUs tested failed to
provide 40 FPS on average while most
fell short of 60 fps it's interesting to
see flagship GPUs such as the fury X for
example rubbing shoulders with the rx
570 of course things were even worse at
1440p and just a handful of GPUs managed
to break the 40 FPS barrier this clearly
isn't a title for high refresh rate
gaming very few GPUs provided play
performance at 4k and no surprises there
and you will without question required
the latest and greatest in rendering
technology firing up some old bangers
for the medium quality preset tests
provided some more horrendously low
numbers it has to be said even with
these reduced quality settings the RX
570 could
even average 60fps at Tony P the GTX 780
Ti was barely able to beat the 1050 Ti
with just over 50 FPS on average again
more than half of the GPUs tested
couldn't render 40 FPS on average I
guess there's always the lowest quality
settings
speaking of low quality settings if you
dial everything down using the low
quality preset at 1080p the GTX 1060
spits out just 79 FPS on average and the
rx 580 just 67 fps you can also see why
we didn't use the ultra quality preset
for our testing the very high preset
which we decided to use allows for over
30% more performance with the GTX 1060
and just over 25% with the rx 580 and
again the difference in visual quality
isn't that significant the high and very
high quality presets deliver much the
same performance we see a 15 and 20%
points uplift when dropping down to the
medium quality setting and then a
further 10 to 15% with low here is a
quick look at how Odyssey compares to
origins in terms of performance
obviously we can't really make a proper
apples to apples comparison as they are
different games but both games were
tested in a big city area overall
performance appears to be very similar
1% low performance was noticeably better
with origin so perhaps that is something
that will be improved with Odyssey after
a patch or two but overall we see pretty
much the same lackluster performance
that was seen previously okay so in my
opinion Assassin's Creed Odyssey looks
much like 2007 teens origins and just
like last year's installment
it's an optimized pile of dung I
certainly appreciate that developing a
video game isn't easy there's a lot of
work involved but it's hard not to
criticize developer Ubisoft when just
days ago I was testing a vastly superior
looking game in Forza horizon 4 which
allowed for similar performance at 4k to
what we have just seen here with Odyssey
at 1080p yeah it's really that bad to be
fair though I shouldn't really compare a
racing game with an action role-playing
title but still overall Forza looked
much more impressive and the GTX 1080i
was 73% faster at 4k still Tim didn't
like that comparison he suggested I talk
about shadow of the
rennet which admittedly makes much more
sense to marae to saw the r-tx 28 ET i
delivered 25% more performance at 4k
while vega 64 was a little over 25
percent faster so in that comparison
Assassin's Creed Odyssey doesn't look
quite as bad but even so it's still
visually inferior and we're comparing
performance of the second highest
quality preset to the highest quality
settings and shut off the Tomb Raider so
again not a great result for a newly
released title in late 2018 of course
for many of you the performance won't
come as a surprise as I noted visually
Assassin's Creed Odyssey is similar to
Assassin's Creed origins and performance
wise they're also very similar Tim and I
both feel that the game engine is really
starting the Sharks age at this point
it's basically the same engine as unity
from 2014 and they're simply trying to
do too much with it at least that's our
opinion there's a lot of harsh swapping
of shadows and elements as you move
around the world and that really spoils
the experience in our opinion it's not
great seeing those things jump in and
out and change on the fly as you're
moving around they don't really fade or
transitioning as smoothly as we would
have liked to have seen so it really
spoils the experience but having said
all that don't get us wrong it's still a
really nice-looking game the performance
hit though just doesn't justify the
visuals that we were seeing when playing
I'm also really keen to see what Tim
comes up with once he digs into the
individual quality settings though I'm
not really expecting any miracles given
what we saw with the low-quality preset
performance was still a very mediocre
their performance numbers aside though I
don't doubt that Assassin's Creed
Odyssey will end up being a fun game of
course this isn't a review and I haven't
really read that many reviews of the
game yet so we'll have to see what all
the fans of the franchise come back with
and yeah what their opinion is I just
wish that those fans could enjoy the
game without needing any kind of
futuristic hardware and that is going to
do it for this one I'm pretty buggered
at this stage I didn't expect to be
doing another 50 GPU roundup straight
after doing Forza horizon 4 but that's
how it's turned yeah I think we have
some more games coming out later this
month so much more testing to be done
