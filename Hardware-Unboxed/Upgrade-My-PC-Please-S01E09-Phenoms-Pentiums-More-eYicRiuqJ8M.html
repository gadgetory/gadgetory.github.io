please this episode was meant to be
aired last week but I got sick so it's
been delayed to this week and we do have
one more episode coming next week anyway
on the episode two weeks ago which would
have been episode 8 we did have five
randomly selected computers all in need
of various upgrades and you the viewers
voted Scott's FX 8120 PC the most worthy
of receiving the proposed upgrades and
that means coming his way will be a
rising 5 1400 processor the MSI be 350
Motherwell eight gigabytes of ddr4
memory and a geforce gtx 1050 graphics
card so not about a lot great package
there at all
and then of course for all your viewers
don't forget to vote each week is that
will place you in the running to win
some very cool prizes and those are
global giveaways last episode's winner
took home a very cool AMD arisin 5 CPU
this week's winner will be announced in
the video and you'll find out what's
being given away then alright now we
have a randomly another random bunch of
randomly random randomly selected random
computers it's all very random let's go
check it out
as you built the system eight years ago
with multitasking in mind he says
initially the system was built inside
the Alienware
al X case which featured a 1,000 watt
power supply the Alienware case was
starting to fall apart donut looked
pretty miserable I'm told so earlier
this year and replaced it with the
impressive case labs SMA 8 he also
brought over that 1000 watt power supply
he says since he can't afford all the
parts for an enthusiast grade build all
the ones he started with the case and
has decided to work from there right now
the system is used for gaming and video
editing and andrew is keen to check out
more modern gaming tiles he just needs
an upgrade first obviously the objective
would be to replace the very old AMD
phenom ii x4 955 processor impossible
the Radeon HD 6870 graphics card as well
however given how serious Andrew seems
about is liquid cooling hardware I feel
we really should opt for something a bit
more extreme than your entry-level or
your typical entry-level be 315
motherboard so
let's lock the risin five 1600 on two
gigabytes a x-37 in-game in k3 with 16
gigabytes of ddr4 3000 memory that
really is the best option for a content
creator on a $500 u.s. budget this
upgrade will drastically reduce Andrews
render times in fact I can't really even
imagine what it would be like going from
a phantom to processor to something like
the Rison 5 1600 James first built this
PC back in 2012 and at the time it did
have a Radeon HD 5450 graphics card
which was later upgraded to a HD 6870
and finally last year the Radeon r9
furio's dropped in and at the time he
also took the opportunity to move
everything into a shiny new Corsair
Vengeance C 70 case the storage and
power supply have also been upgraded and
the PC really was built to play games
and edit videos and today nothing has
changed James also went hobbies in a
hedge TC vibe with his brother and it
works on the PC he says but he is keen
to expand upon the games they can play
and while this will require a CPU
upgrade he's also keen to increase the
processing power of the CPU for his
video editing and now CAD work his plan
right now is to upgrade to the a m4
platform and he likes the option of
being outed by either a Verizon 5 or
perhaps even a Rison 7 CPU or maybe even
something better in the future given how
poor availability is of the 8th gen core
series right now Verizon really is the
only option that said for gaming and
productivity performance it's really
hard to go past something like the Rison
5 1600 so it's a pretty simple upgrade
then as was the case with the previous
build let's go with the Rison 5 1600 but
this time we will be putting it on the
slightly more affordable of sue's prime
B 350 plus with a gigabytes of memory
and then we'll be calling it a day that
combo will be able to extract much more
performance from that Radeon r9 Fury
graphics card should James win
next up we have John's lazy moose built
with these dodges before Christmas a
late last year after purchasing the CPU
motherboard and memory secondhand then
they picked up the most affordable
graphics card they could which happen to
be the Radeon rx 460 and they threw that
in the smallest cheapest case they could
find which turned out to be the cooler
Master Elite 110 it's a neat little PC
but despite being just shy of a year old
it really struggles to let anything more
than the most basic games such as Age of
Empires 2 rocket league and quake well
the radio rx 460 isn't the most potent
GPU the real issue here is the skylake
jewel called Pentium processor now we
could ditch the G 4400 for something
like the core i7 7700 but four hundred
and ten dollars ozzie that's not really
a cost-effective move and we'd still
have to make do with that H 110 board
for slightly more we can pick up a be
350 mother but with a 6-quart 12 thread
Verizon v 1600 and if we really push the
budget we can squeeze in a geforce gtx
1050 TI which will be a fairly
substantial upgrade from that RX 460
this upgrade will enable john to make
further upgrades in the future whereas
the h 110 board was pretty much a dead
end of the 7700 K would have been the
end of the road there so I feel given
the budget this is probably the best
option going forward next up we have
another Aussie Francesca a fellow
Melburnian and on display is the tiny
purple pixel eater this swanky regal
looks far more impressive than it really
is I have to say despite looking the
part inside it's powered by a rather
underwhelming
AMD a8 6600 K APU though the GPU
firepower has been improved with the gtx
960 the system does have eight gigabytes
of memory but of course it is ddr3
memory so we'll have to give that the
flick that said the Samsung Evo 250
gigabyte SSD is a nice addition and will
certainly keep that along with the
funky-looking Aero call X predator cube
case Franchesca is a gamer who admits
she was once an Xbox /we gamer but her
fiance show
the light and got her to become a member
of the PC master-race the only problem
is she wants to get into more modern
games and the system really is
struggling and she says it often freezes
this thenns another job for horizon that
said though if the core i5 8400 was in
stock that might have been my
recommendation for this one anyway as it
stands the r5 1600 is the only option
and will slot that onto the gigabyte a B
350 M dash d 3h motherboard since we
can't really afford a better graphics
card on our budget let's instead up for
16 gigabytes of ddr4 memory if Francesca
wins perhaps you can sell that old
hardware get rid of the gtx 960 and
perhaps replace that with the gtx 1060
or something along those lines last but
not least we have Joshua's prowl a
humble old Core 2 quad system that I
just had to include because these photos
are so nice there you go guys pro tip
for season 12 upgrade my PC please it's
all about them photos anyway handy
camerawork aside
Joshua certainly needs a few upgrades
Joshua sounds like a real PC part
scavenger like he could almost be Brian
from tech yes city's brother no offense
mate
he says he's that guy who collects old
used and unwanted parts from his friends
and puts them in his own PC as a result
in 2017 this is what he's dealing with
and things look as though they're
probably moving quite slowly
despite the pcs age you still enjoy his
games such as praying he also does a lot
of video editing work in Premiere
so while Joshua would like to enjoy the
latest and greatest games his focus
really is on video editing work given
the GeForce GTX 970 is still very
capable especially at 1080p we don't
really need to allocate any of our
budget here instead we're going to be
focusing entirely on rendering power and
that means securing the mighty AMD
horizon 717 hundred and eight course
sixteen thread CPU and that will make
light work of Joshua's videos the
horizon processor will be installed on
the impressive-looking
a seuss ROG Strix B 350 - F gaming
motherboard with eight gigabytes of ddr4
memory all right guys there's
five different pcs all the neat our
various upgrades it's now your job to
let us know which one you think is the
most deserving of receiving the proposed
upgrade package to cast your vote follow
the link in the video description
that'll head you over to the textbook
forums by signing up for the forums
commenting and voting you also go on the
reign to win some cool prizes and those
are again global giveaways speaking of
which the winner from last week's
episode is Sheriff India hope I said
that even remotely correctly anyway
congratulations mate I don't think
you're gonna care because you now have
an AOC gaming monitor coming your way
and is a free sync supported monitor big
thanks to AIC providing that amazing
prize remember guys vote and comment
each week because that will put you in
the running to win more awesome prizes
finally as always voting is open til
Friday night in the US and that's
Saturday afternoon here in Australia and
then we'll announce the winner of this
episode at the start of next week's
episode which should be shown next week
