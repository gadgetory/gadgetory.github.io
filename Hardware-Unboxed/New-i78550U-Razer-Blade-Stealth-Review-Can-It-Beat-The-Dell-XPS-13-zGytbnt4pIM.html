video on the razor blade stealth
shouldn't take too long as I'm only
going to be covering a couple of aspects
and that's for a very good reason this
new model doesn't change a whole lot
compared to its predecessor which I
looked at in September last year rather
than boring myself and new guys with
details of things that haven't changed
at all I'm just going to focus on the
new goodies in this model for early 2018
the main upgrade is in the processor
department where razors surprised
everyone by moving to a KB Lake refresh
Intel Core i7
8550 you wait that's not really
surprised though is it anyway it's a
decent performance upgrade from what
we've seen in other laptops and it's
something I'll go into more detail on
shortly the battery capacity is still
the same at 53.6 watt hours however with
the new processor inside we may see a
few changes to battery life
razor also bumped the memory speed up
from lpddr3
1866 to LP ddr3 2133 at the same 16 gig
capacity every other aspect of the hard
way is the same including the 13.3 inch
3200 by 1800 XO LCD
killer networking gear and SSD options
that range from 256 gig to 1 terabyte
there are some very minor changes to the
laptops dimensions but they fall into
the sub 1 millimeter of range and the
weight is basically unchanged as a
result the beautiful metal chassis is
pretty much identical to the version I
reviewed back in September so for my
full thoughts on that design check that
video but as a quick recap it's really
good with decent IO that includes
Thunderbolt 3 and a full-sized HDMI port
along with an individually RGB backlit
keyboard with acceptable tactile fiedel
and a great trackpad the display is also
the same I did retest this unit just to
make sure but there's really nothing new
to report here aside from some minor
adjustments to white balance and gamma
correction before getting into the
performance I will talk pricing because
I know this will disappoint you the new
Razer Blade stealth has launched at u.s.
$100 more than the equivalent last gen
model at launch moving from fourteen
hundred dollars to fifteen hundred
dollars for a chorus
7:16 gig of ram and or 256 gig SSD
considering the new cpu is only slightly
more expensive than the old one in terms
of intel's
cost to OEMs this seems a little
unreasonable however it is still cheaper
than equivalent high end laptops like
the dell XPS 13 and HP spectre when you
configure the models around the same in
australia the pricing remains the same
with the base model starting at 2200
ozzie dollar e-news that's actually a
fair price with minimal australia tax
which is nice for us locals so let's
talk performance the key upgrade here is
the intel core i7
8550 you which i've covered a couple of
times before on the channel compared to
previous seventh gen you seriously
abused
8550 bumps up from two cores and four
threads to four cores and eight threads
in the same 15 watt power envelope which
is a huge improvement for these sort of
systems clock speeds for this chip
removed from 1.8 gigahertz base to 4.0
gigahertz boost
plus there's crappy integrated graphics
sorry I mean UHD 620 graphics - what are
the key things to note with the chorus
78552 is its configurable TDP allowing
manufacturers to choose a power limit
anywhere from 10 to 25 Watts depending
on the cooling capabilities and battery
requirements the Razer Blade stealth
uses the default 15 Watts here which we
also saw with the HP Spectre x-360
however unlike the spec - X - 60 the
blade stealth actually has a reasonable
cooler so it can sustain higher clock
speeds in a typical Cinebench run core
clocks are approximately 300 megahertz
higher with the razor blade stealth and
temperatures a bit more manageable as a
result performance is almost always
superior looking at the actual Cinebench
results the razor blade stuff ends up 3%
ahead of the spectre x360 in the
multi-threaded workload and 9% faster
we're looking at the single third test
however the laptop does for 18% behind
the dell XPS 13 in the multi-threaded
test as the XPS 13 uses the maximum 25
watts see TDP upstate and as a result it
sustains a bit higher clock speeds in
x264 video encoding where once again 18%
slower than the dell XPS 13
however we are at least 5% ahead of the
HP spectre x360 and fall closer to what
we
backed with a 15 watt variant of this
CPU in the Excel Monte Carlo workload
the blade stealth beats the spectre x360
by 8% and outperforms the XPS 13 by 4%
the blade stealth does sustain the
maximum or core turbo frequency of 3.7
gigahertz for slightly longer than the
same CPU in the XPS 13 which is why
we're seeing the XPS 13 get narrowly
beaten in this short workload Premiere
is another great result for this blade
stealth beating the spectre x360 by 13%
with lumetri effects and outperforming
the XPS 13 by 5% it's a bit of a
surprise there but those are the results
I found however looking at Photoshop
with the iris blur effect the blade
stealth is 5 percent behind the XPS 13
and equal to the spectre x360 blender
it's probably not a workload you'd
usually run on an ultraportable but the
results are interesting nonetheless here
the blade stealth is 6 percent faster
than the spectre x360 but 16 percent
behind the XPS 13 MATLAB favors higher
clock speeds and high quick boost speeds
here the blade stealth delivers roughly
the same performance as the XPS 13 and a
narrow 3 percent more than the spectre
x360 among laptops there's not a lot of
variance between these results and of
course we are talking about run times in
the milliseconds the blade stealth also
performs well in 3dmark delivering 9
percent more performance than the
spectre x360 and around 4 percent less
than the XPS 13 in a GPU limited sky
diver test you won't want to play many
tiles on the integrated UHD 620 graphics
though there is a clear difference in
performance between different models
depending on their cooling solutions
perhaps the worst results for the blade
stealth are the Pacey mark tests which
fall behind both the spectre x360 and
the Dell XPS 13 as a more general system
benchmark it's disappointing to see the
blade Styles not perform a bit better
here especially considering the other
workloads we benchmark with on average
the blade stealth is 4 percent faster
than the HP spectre x360 though this is
skewed slightly by the PC mark results
in longer workloads particularly
encoding the blade stealth holds in
decent 9 percent performance lean and
that's the product of its superior
cooler under the same TDP the results
compared to the Dell XPS 13 err inter
stick falling 3% behind on average that
this does balloon to 11% in longer
workloads as the razor blade stealth
boosts higher for longer in short
workloads it actually outperforms the
XPS 13 on average in these shorter tests
of course it's also worth discussing how
the razor blade stealth with the I 78550
you compares to the previous model with
the i7 7500 you on average we see a 30%
performance improvement which is huge
for a single intelligent with better
performance seen in shorter workloads
there are still very impressive gains in
longer and multi-threaded workloads like
a lot of ultraportable manufacturers
Razer has opted to use a samsung PM 961
PCIe nvme SSD which is a top-end drive
capable of outstanding performance
sequential reads and writes are well
above 1 gigabyte per second while ran
performance is very good falling towards
the top of the charts the battery life
is the next thing I want to examine and
like I mentioned earlier the new player
stealth keeps the same 54 what our cell
as the previous model which is a
standard size for a 13 inch laptop
battery life appears to be roughly on
par with the old model as you can see in
this couple of benchmarks the result is
average battery life not particularly
impressive but also not unusable either
it does get soundly beaten by both the
HP Spectre x-360 and the dell XPS 13
though which is disappointing
considering the similar hardware in both
laptops my final thoughts on the blade
stealth are similar to the last time I
reviewed this laptop I quite liked it
the build quality is excellent and
complemented well by the RGB keyboard
and trackpad the display is good with a
nice high resolution and it's not as
hamstrung by bezels as previous models
it's also great to see the improved
performance the Intel Core i7
8550 provides and unlike some other
laptops I've reviewed roses cooling
solution can keep the 15 watt CPU
performing as expected there's no
doubting this is a premium laptop and
that's reflected by the $1,500 u.s.
price tag however razer does give you
top end hardware for that price the 8550
u + 16 gig of ram are standard as is the
high resolution display while other
laptops cut back with their cheaper
entry-level models directly comparing
the
stealth the other premium laptop shows
it's fairly priced which might surprise
some of you when the base cost is so
high my only real concern with the blade
stealth continues to be the battery life
you can get better results from similar
laptops such as the outstanding dou X
base 13 aside from that the blade staff
gets my ticket approval provided you
don't fall foul of the occasional QA
issues razer has had with this unit over
the past few years didn't have any
problems with my reviewing it but I have
seen a couple of user reviews out there
that mention a few defects that can be
shipped from the factory that's it for
this review as always we have amazon

ultra portable laptops in the
