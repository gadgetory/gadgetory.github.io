today's view having a bit of fun with a
product that I bought off eBay using my
own hard-earned cash it's they lead up
to send to this thing has been sitting
on my desk for a few months just
tempting me to test it and I finally got
around to it this week and there's a bit
of a story to it so back in May a member
of our wonderful discord community for
patreon members messaged me asking to
test an external laptop cooler it was a
while back can't find the exact message
but they wanted me to see whether a $15
plastic box with a crappy fan inside can
actually improve the cooling performance
of a laptop and they linked me to this
eBay page now as you can see the listing
is for a mini vacuum air extracting USB
cooling pad cooler fan for PC notebook
laptop you can buy them brand-new with
free shipping for just 15 Australian
dollars which for our American viewers
is about $10 and I'm sure there are
equivalent products over there the
sellers name of course gave me a lot of
confidence who wouldn't trust qcq CBJ
2018 with 98.9% positive feedback rating
the main image for the listing shows
that the red lightning coming out of
your PC will be turned into blue
lightning through the magic of this
cooling box one of the images does show
the cooler increasing the noise levels
in the room which I found a bit strange
it's also easy to install it has
high-speed air flow sufficient airflow
for gaming and supposedly provides
better heat displacement better yet it's
low noise and will not influence its
life by dust and you can sleep right
next to me to go into a picture as well
as for specs there's a 75 millimetre fan
inside and spins between 1500 and 3000
rpm depending on what you set it pushes
up to 75 point 3 5 CFM of air and
consumes 1.75 watts of power and this is
the actual product that arrived as you
can see it's an ice troll game and
notebook cooling equipment there's a
bunch of Chinese writing on the box that
I can't read on the back is a breakdown
of all the key points I've just been
talking about including the game
radiation weapon and highlight mirror
that it provides so let's take a look
inside the box itself yeah look you get
a whole bunch of stuff in here we'll
talk about this stuff in in just a
moment but this itself is the the unit
itself I guess you have to say it's
really ugly
it's chunky it's made of really crap
plastic we'll take a look at that more
in just a moment then you'll also get
these three blue rubbers which I guess
protect against cooler disease and also
ensure no air leakage there's also a USB
power cable a plastic attachment finger
which I think is still in the Box here
and a few bits and pieces including a
manual and some other stuff so yeah now
let's talk a bit about installing this
unit to a laptop it was suggested to me
that I should test this cooler with a
thin and light machine that may have
weak cooling that throttles the
components problem if that is almost no
modern thinner light machines are
compatible with this style of cooler the
idea here is that you put the cooler
next to the fan exhaust vent on your
laptop pretty much straight on it except
with Mon Ultra portables there is no fan
vent that's actually accessible my daily
driver is an LG gram and this laptops
fan exhaust is built into the hinge it's
the same case with the Dell XPS 13 and
15 razor blade stealth HP Spectre Lion
Lenovo yoga devices most of su sin books
I mean I really could go on here the one
exception I could find is the Lenovo
ThinkPad X series but it's a rare option
among many with hinge vents in any case
I don't have any thin laptops on hand
that I can test with this sort of cooler
hinge vents are also common for many
gaming laptops it's not as common but
it's still a widely used option razor's
blade line and gigabytes error 15 are
two examples that rely on hinge
ventilation of the laptops that don't
exhaust air in this manner usually there
are multiple vents on the sides and rear
of the body so this cooler can only be
applied to one vent the laptop I use for
testing is the msi ge70 5 which has four
vents two on the rear and one on each
side the left-hand ports are for the CPU
cooling fan and the right-hand ports are
for the GPU cooler which operate
independently and vary their output
depending on how the components are used
i tried this cooler on all the vents but
i'll let you know which
I used when I get to the testing results
the installation process for the cooler
is a little strange the flap that
attaches to the cooler comes with
adhesive which you're supposed to stick
to the underside of your laptop but I'm
not sure why you would do this sure you
wouldn't want to keep the cooler
permanently attached especially as its
massive and ungainly it seems like a
very weird way to keep it secure anyway
I'm sure you're all eating to know
whether this thing actually works let's
work through the results starting with
some CPU testing in handbrake the basics
to know he is that I attached the cooler
to the left side vent which exhausts air
from the CPU side of the core I then ran
two configurations without the cooler
both the default auto fan mode for the
laptop and a quiet mode which would put
the fans into the lowest speed MSI would
allow I then tested both of these modes
also with the cooler which itself was
set to one of two modes either the
minimum fan speed or the maximum fan
speed as set through the dial on the
unit itself I measured the CPU
temperature the noise output and the
average performance throughout the
benchmark without the cooler the CPU did
run hot reaching 90 degrees Celsius
under load with the default fan speed or
95 C with the quiet fan speed noise
levels were also quite high at 47.7 DBA
for the default speed which was 5
degrees cooler than the quieter 43 DBA
fan mode performance in either of these
modes was roughly the same slightly
faster with the louder fans but not
significantly so using the cooler wasn't
really all that helpful with fan set to
the auto mode and the cooler set to its
minimum fan speed the best I was able to
achieve was a 1 degree temperature
reduction for a 1 DBA increase to noise
and then with fan set to maximum a 3
degree reduction for a huge jump in
noise output to 51.7 DBA performance in
both situation was pretty much unchanged
it wasn't much better with the fan set
to quiet using the cooler with the
minimum fan speed reduced temperatures
by 3 degrees
burro's altered in a 3 DB a increased to
noise and then with fan set to maximum
the internal laptop fans were drowned
out by the noisy cooler which only
improved temperatures by 5 degrees
the thing I noticed immediately about
these results is that if you're after a
quiet air experience this coolant really
isn't providing it
increasing the fan speeds of the laptop
itself was more effective at cooling the
CPU and resulted in about the same
increase to noise as using this external
cooler achieving just a minimum noise
output of 47 DBA with the cooler still
made the laptop quiet loud so this isn't
ideal for say quieting down your laptop
and running at a lower temperature but
also making the fans a bit quieter it
also really has no impact on performance
this is because the CPU itself isn't
throttling in any of these conditions
tested here as you'd expect from a good
laptop cooler design of course so to
further stress test the system and see
whether it has any benefit in more
constraint scenarios I decided to block
the other exhaust vent so that all air
was forced out the single vent with the
cooler attached in this situation with
fan speeds still set to auto there was a
three degree increase to temperatures
but still no throttling using the
external cooler with the fence being set
to maximum resulted in a two degree
temperature reduction which is pretty
pathetic to be honest there was also no
change to performance so I decided to
stress the system out more and really
get this thing throttling I did that by
increasing the ambient room temperature
from 21 degree Celsius the standard for
our testing to a hot Australian summer
day of 40 degrees Celsius with one vent
still blocked the system did throttle
under Auto fan speeds with the CPU
cooking at 95 degrees Celsius
performance only dropped by 7% but a
drop is still a drawn at the cooler into
the mix and well there was no difference
to CPU temperatures in fact the laptop
was still throttling at 95 degrees but
performance did improve rather than a 7%
reduction to throttling the system was
now running by just 4% again I guess a
rather unimpressive result so with all
that testing done I thought maybe this
cooler would help with GPU temperatures
so I shifted it over to the back right
vent and used the same testing method
auto and quiet fan speeds under default
conditions the laptop was a bit louder
with all fans running this time and the
difference in GP temperatures was 4
degrees between auto and quiet fan
speeds for the same in-game performance
focusing on the quiet fan speeds now
using the external cooler laughably
actually did nothing to affect
performance in fact running at the
coolest minimum fan speed GPU
temperatures
identical and noise output increased by
two DBA so that's pretty useless
cranking the fans up to maximum decrease
the GPU temperature by a measly one
degree while increasing noise output
significantly all for no change in game
performance hilariously I discovered
that rather than using the cooler for
its intended purpose if you use the
cooler to raise the base of your laptop
GPU temperatures dropped by three
degrees so the cooler is more effective
as a basic laptop stand than as an
actual cooler and I guess that just goes
to show how rubbish this sort of product
is so after these results I guess the
question you have to ask is why doesn't
this product work it seems like it does
increase the airflow the fans speed up
like crazy and appears to shoot out the
fair bit more air through this vent than
the laptops offense itself but why
doesn't this have a meaningful impact of
performance well there are several
possible explanations one is that the
additional air being sucked through the
cooler isn't actually passing through
the heatsink
so isn't impacting temperatures this
could be due to an imperfect seal
between cooler and laptop or between our
laptops outer plastic and the internal
heatsink which would allow air to be
drawn through other sources the other
explanation is simply down to what
happens when you place two fans in
series remember in this system we also
have a fan inside the laptop itself
pushing air through the heatsink which
then goes into the second external fan
in these scenarios
generally speaking the air flow does not
increase but instead the pressure
increases if there's not much resistance
in the system the added pressure from
the second fan won't improve growing
performance significantly these systems
tend to be a bit more complicated than
that so it's a very simplified
exploration but basically placing
another fan in series with an existing
fan isn't necessarily going to improve
performance unless there's an air flow
resistance issue which for this laptop
and presumably many others isn't really
the case after all gaming laptops these
days tend to have optimized and well
designed interiors to squeeze as much
cooling performance out of a small
design as possible
so really this sort of external cooling
product is just a big load of crap and
really isn't worth the 15 dollars that I
paid for it definitely wouldn't
recommend this to really anyone if you
do have a laptop that's running hot what
recommendation I often make is simply to
raise the base slightly of your desk
this can lower the intake air resistance
but more importantly can also lower the
intake air temperature as it isn't
sucking air through a narrow channel
under your laptop past a typically hot
underside on its way to the fan laptop
cooling pads work through a similar
principle but can add additional cooling
due to parallel fans and the ability to
directly cool the underside of your
laptop where the heat sinks normally
pass over there not a great option but
they're certainly much better than this
sort of rubbish so yeah really that's my
thoughts on this laptop cooler thing
really not sure what I'll do with it now
I certainly won't be using it to cool
any laptops maybe I'll just point it at
my face or something during the the hot
summer months here or just throw it in
the bin where this sort of thing really
belongs subscribe for more content
