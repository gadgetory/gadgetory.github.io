video is a follow-up of yesterday's
video where we talked about the Intel
processor exploit now in that video we
covered much of what we knew at the time
and that was that major operating
systems were getting patched or had just
been patched to solve a potential
security issue with Intel CPUs we've now
let this issue also extend to a few
select ARM processor architectures but
AMD still appear to be mostly in the
clear there are three variants of the
exploit an AMD was vulnerable to one of
them the bounds check bypass method but
this can be solved via an OS update
shouldn't come at a significant
performance cost the other two variants
though they don't appear to impact AMD
processors due to the differences in
architectural design now in yesterday's
video we looked at some testing done by
fir onyx so that was the main reason I
went ahead with d'Ovidio at the time as
we had some real numbers to talk about
at the time only the Linux operating
system had to receive the update
addressing the exploit and for onyx
benchmark performance before and after
they found some pretty crippling
performance for the server related tests
using the core i7 87 are okay with a
samsung 950 pro nvme storage device they
then followed up with a Linux gaming
test and looked at half a dozen tiles
and mostly found the difference was
within the margin of error so gamers and
desktop users looked as though they
would be unaffected and I assume this
would be the case at the time but I
promised I'd also test to the impact for
Windows users as soon as I could after a
late night working on that video I was
up bright and early today for some
reason I don't know why but it was a
good thing that I was because Microsoft
had already pushed out an emergency fix
for Windows users Windows 10 users
should be able to get that update
automatically through the Windows Update
feature now Windows 7 &amp;amp; 8 users well
they can get the patch directly from the
Microsoft web site today or they can
wait till patch Tuesday to receive it
automatically via the Windows Update the
patch titled kb 4 0 5 6 8 9 2 does have
one fairly severe known issue Microsoft
notes that your update installation may
stop at 99% and this may show elevated
CPU or disk utilization if the device
was reset using the reset this PC
functionality after installing the KB
4:05
I've four zero double to update anyway
the good news is we can finally retest
to see what impact this update has on
performance for desktop users if any at
all now a few things to note here I've
only had time to test the 87 okay so no
older generation Intel CPUs have been
tested yet I've also not checked to see
if this patch has any impact on AMD CPUs
the benchmarks you're about to see for
the 87 ok were all conducted today they
are all fresh and testing was conducted
on the same test system under the same
conditions I first updated all my pre
patched data and then applied the patch
and retested as usual a gaming
performance figures are all based on an
average of three runs now for the
storage tests I dude things are a little
differently since those numbers tend to
fluctuate a bit more normally I again do
take the average from three runs but for
this test I've taken the best result for
each individual test and shown that
instead in total I gave each
configuration for temps to post the best
result it could and between each run the
system was powered completely down and
then build it back up ok so that's
enough about that let's get to the
benchmarks starting with the storage
tests we have the a s SSD benchmark and
for those tests I'm using the Samsung
SSD 950 Pro with the 87 or okay here we
see very similar sequential read and
write results the figures after the
update are actually slightly better
though we're talking just a one to two
percent difference here where we see a
significant difference as we're looking
at the 4k read result here we see a very
large 23 percent reduction in
performance going from a throughput of
44 megabytes per second to just 34
megabytes per second the random 4k write
performance though well that goes
unchanged so it's just the random 4k
reads that are significantly down
interestingly though the 4k 64 thread
read and write performance is improved
with the patch the write performance
here has been boosted by 17% so that's
certainly not bad news though I'd argue
that the 4k read result is more serious
read access times were also 14% lower
before the update but the right access
time is much the same moving on we find
that crystal D smart confirms what we've
seen when testing with a SSS D benchmark
here the 4k Reaper formance has been
reduced by 23% after the patch the rest
of the margins are within 5% so nothing
really worth noting the last storage
focus test I ran was a toe disk
benchmark and here we find something
very interesting these are all
sequential read and write tests so the
4k results here won't necessarily
reflect what we saw previously and while
they clearly don't however as the file
size grows to 16 kilobytes we start to
see a noticeable drop in performance
with the update the drop-off isn't as
significant as the 4k read results seen
previously but we are still seeing up to
a 9% reduction in throughput the
Cinebench r15 score is based on an
average of 3 runs and here we see a
slight variation in performance but
nothing to be alarmed about the
multi-threaded score is reduced by 2%
while this single thread score was
increased by a percent so margin of
error stuff then we see much the same in
blender the update came in a fraction
ahead but again within the margin of
error another render test this time over
the corona benchmark and again nothing
really to report here so it seems like
your rendering workloads won't be
impacted likewise your spreadsheets will
remain as snappy as ever we see no
improvement or decline in performance
here at all
the 7-zip compression and decompression
performance looks much the same again
this is within the margin of error for
this test veracrypt also saw no
difference for the one gigabyte and 50
megabyte AES encryption and decryption
testing okay so time to get serious with
a few game benchmarks first that we have
the always dependable ash of the
singularity here we see a small uplift
in performance after the patch has been
applied granted the 1% low result was
only improved by 1.7 percent but still
it's certainly not slower
we're also CPU bound for this test using
the high quality preset so not GPU bound
boosting the quality preset to crazy
does result in a GPU limited scenario
and again we find similar results before
and after the patch has been installed
Assassin's Creed origins was a game I
was really keen to check out due to the
type of protection that game uses to
stop piracy that said though as you can
see nothing worth talking about here
apart from the fact that patch has no
negative impact on frame rates and
switching to the ultra high quality
preset doesn't
either then finally we have the
battlefield 1 results and using the
medium quality settings at 1080p with
the gtx 1080i we see similar performance
before and after the patch in fact once
again after the patch has been applied
we do see a very minor improvement this
is again seen with the ultra quality
settings so things look pretty good
with the core i7 87 ok well there you
have it as suspected based on the Linux
results that we featured in yesterday's
video and desktop users really have
nothing to worry about particularly
gamers that said I am yet to test older
CPUs but given the type of workloads
we're seeing impacted by the patch I
don't think there's really gonna be any
issue there with your typical desktop
workloads but if there is I'll certainly
report back with that information the
reduction in 4k performance though for
the high-speed nvme drives that is a bit
of a concern and while this shouldn't
impact things like games any
applications that are sensitive to this
might show a reduction in performance of
course the brief list of applications I
tested were all fine and there was no
issues there as we also saw in
yesterday's benchmark which looked at
some server benchmarks that's really
where the problem is so it's a bit of a
non-issue for desktop users but it could
be quite a serious concern for data
centers and the like that's not really
our area of expertise or interest though
so we'll leave that testing for those
better equipped to tackle it if you have
any questions or something you'd like to
add to the topic then please feel free
to drop that down in the comment section
below I'm your host Steve see you next
