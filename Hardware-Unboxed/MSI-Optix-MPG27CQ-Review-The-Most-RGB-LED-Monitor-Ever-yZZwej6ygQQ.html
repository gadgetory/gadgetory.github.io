we're looking at the MSI optics MGP 27
CQ gaming monitor the first msi monitor
we've had hands on timeless they are a
relatively new player in the monitor
space having entered the market right
the end of 2016 but it kind of makes
sense to them considering major
competitors like a soos of had monitors
available for ages the MGP 27 CQ is
MSI's newest gaming monitor having
launched at CES 2018
it's a 27-inch 1440p curved VA LCD with
a 144 hertz maximum refresh rate and
free sync in other words very appealing
specifications for gamers there's also a
cheaper variant of otherwise the same
monitor the MGP 27c and that swaps out
the 1440p resolution for just 1080p oh
and if you happen to live in Australia
or New Zealand we're giving away one of
these monitors thanks to MSI and PC case
gear more details at the end so back to
the review while the spec sheet doesn't
bring anything new to the table we've
seen 1440p 144 hertz monitors before
there is one rather unique edition here
the RGB LED light bar along the bottom
edge now when I first saw this model I
thought the LED light bar is a really
stupid idea I mean who needs a
distracting RGB strip shining at you
while your game has MSI taken this whole
RGB craze too far and in some respects
that is true if you leave the light
strip set to its default rainbow mode
it's super annoying even just sending it
to a solar color is a bad ideas the
light shined towards you rather than
down towards your desk like with other
monitors that have LED lighting however
static colors and flashing lights don't
seem to be the point of the light strip
instead it's designed with SteelSeries
game sense in mind with the utility
installed your computer SteelSeries
games hence can modify the light strip
based on the game you're playing and
various stats within for example with
the csgo integration enabled the light
bar can show various stats like health
and
kills money and more it's actually
pretty handy - is it can give you a
basic color-coded indicator at a glance
or just in your peripheral vision
without needing to check the HUD or
other stats in-game and like with a lot
of RGB utilities the game integrations
are highly customizable unfortunately
not many games are supported right now
with the biggest games on the list being
csgo dota 2 and minecraft but hopefully
the ecosystem will grow as I can see it
being more than just a gimmick
if you don't play those games though or
you don't want to use the LED strip just
disable it anyway enough about RGB
strips or monitors let's take a look at
the rest of the design the design is
fairly standard using elements we've
seen on other msi products the stand
base is made from a solid metal with a
premium coated finish however the rest
of the build is mostly plastic of
various textures and finishes the
mishmash of designs on the rear looks a
little unusual particularly the cyber
style RG based sections but luckily this
is an area that most people won't see in
a lot of cases personally I tend to
prefer more minimalistic monitor designs
that don't bother with game elements
however the MGP 27 CQ doesn't take a
gamer style to the same extreme as with
ASUS ROG products and from the front it
looks just like a standard monitor with
pleasingly little visual flair aside
from that RGB strip of course I did
notice one small manufacturing issue
with the strip along the bottom edge of
the display it's not quite attached
perfectly to the screen leaving a small
gap visible from a top-down angle not a
huge deal but on similar curve - I
haven't noticed such an issue speaking
of the curve we're looking at an 1800 R
curve with this monitor so standard
these days for curve displays I do
prefer flat panels for 16:9 monitors as
the curve doesn't do anything to really
enhance the viewing experience at this
sort of size I like with ultra wires
where the curve does help to keep the
edges more in your field of view that
said the curve is subtle enough that
it's not a big deal as a solo viewer
assuming you're viewing it from dead
center the MGP 27 CQ packs a bunch of
standard features for modern monitors
the stand provides height tilt and
swivel adjustment there
a two port USB 3.0 hub on the left side
plus a couple of convenient 3.5 mm audio
jack pastors for inputs you get
DisplayPort and two HDMI 2.0 ports and
it supports a visa mounting thankfully I
don't need to go on another rant about
on the screen display controls as MSI
has included a directional toggle on the
back and there's a software TV as well
that can control the OSD via the USB
port you won't find anything
particularly unusual innovative in the
OSD but MSI are ticking all the boxes a
low blue light feature low motion blur
toggles picture-in-picture and screen
assistant cheap features like crosshairs
moving on to performance the MP g27 CQ
has a resolution of 2560 by 1440 and a
maximum refresh rate of 144 Hertz so
we're getting a great combination of
resolution and refresh rate in a
previous video last year I said these
sorts of monitors are the best for
gaming for that very reason unless you
specifically want an ultra one that's
still the case today this particular
monitor supports free thick and avoid
the refresh window is technically 48 to
144 Hertz thanks to low framerate
compensation freesync works across the
entire refresh range from 0 to 144 Hertz
NVIDIA GPU owners naturally won't be
able to use adaptive sync with this
monitor but provided you're running at
relatively high frame rates there
shouldn't be too much of an issue and
can save you a bunch of money compared
to buying a g-sync monitor with the same
specs the panel itself is a VA LCD with
MSI claiming one millisecond response
times I find that figure a little hard
to believe going on what I've seen from
other VA panels but from some quick
visual testing ghosting and blur aren't
major issues at 144 Hertz especially
with the response time or overdrive
setting set to the fast preset aside
from that MSI are quite accurate with
their specifications they claimed 400
nits of peak brightness and with the
default calibration I achieved 400 point
8 nits so pretty spot-on there they also
claimed a contrast ratio of 3000 to 1
and across a range of brightnesses I
measured a contrast ratio between 29 18
9 to 1 and 28 60 to 1 so again quite
close and that's
of the benefits of VA technology the
high contrast ratio and relatively deep
blacks unfortunately as with most curved
displays uniformity isn't great the
curve does cause some backlight variance
between the center and edges with a
maximum deviance Delta in a 4.7 when
viewing a white image this is the main
downside to curved panels and why I tend
to prefer basic flat displays instead
and I've yet to see a curved monitor
that really nails the uniformity color
performance is a little strange with the
MGP 27 CQ for some reason MSI has
targeted the NTSC eco space boasting
about 100% NTSC coverage and 115 percent
srgb coverage however this wasn't the
right choice to make NTSC is an outdated
standard with pretty much every
operating system using srgb as the
default standard instead yeah you do get
a hundred and fifteen percent coverage
of srgb but without proper color
management in the OS or a profile for
the monitor this leads to over
saturation when viewing srgb content if
MSI wanted to support a wider color
space they should have looked at Monde
standards like DCI p3 and this monitor
gets close to full coverage in that
space at 89% alternatively they could
have included a toggle to switch between
an NTSC profile and an sRGB mode that
caps performance to 100% srgb for better
accuracy as the monitor targets NTSC
it's no surprise that colors aren't
accurate in the default mode working in
a CCC average of 7 5 6 7 K which is a
bit too blue and a grayscale Delta e of
3.91
and sub 2.2 gamma in both the saturation
and color checker tests the average
Delta a figure also sits around that 3.5
to 3.6 mark which isn't as accurate as
I'd like you can pull back the white
point to a somewhat accurate level
through messing with the on-screen
settings but it doesn't improve things
significantly as the gamut still exceeds
srgb and there are some funky grayscale
results too to get the best out of this
model it really needs to be fully
calibrated using my trusty eye one
display Pro and spectracal scowl man
five software I was able to get the mpg
27 CQ in check which is expected as you
know the panel itself is actually a
pretty decent quality when calibrated I
achieved a grayscale delta T of 0.3
which is of course very good and
basically dead accurate on with a CC T
average of just under 60 500k saturation
and color checker results also now sit
under a delta a average of 1.0 so the
monitor is performing strongly when it's
fully calibrated of course the problem
with any software profile calibration is
some applications choose to ignore it so
at times you will be stuck with default
color performance the MGP 27 CQ isn't
awful by any stretch though in fact for
gamers and others that you know don't
really care all that much about accurate
colors the high contrast and slight over
saturation will be perfectly fine but if
you did want to also use this monitor
for content creation
I would suggest fully calibrating it
like with any product pricing is a big
deal and tends to dictate whether I
recommend something or not the msi
optics MP g27 CQ hasn't launched in the
United States just yet but I hear it's
coming very soon and MSI tells me it
will cost around $500 here in Australia
it's on sale now for $7.99 dollar a dues
having a quick look through other
monitors on PC case key with equivalent
specifications there aren't many notable
options cheaper than the MP g27 CQ this
monitor from AOC and this other one from
Acer are cheaper but both use TN panels
so you're not going to get the same
color quality the closest I could find
is the seuss mg 27 9q which is an IPS
monitor with similar specs for about $40
less that said I'd recommend spending
that little bit extra to get this MSI
monitor for its VA panel with superior
contrast and the RGB LED light by that
you might find useful with supported
games and in the states the mg 27 9q
cost five hundred forty five dollars so
it likely be a bit more expensive than
the msi option i would keep an eye on
the acer xz2 7 one you as a potentially
cheaper option but aside from the usual
biotech monitors I think the MP g27 CQ
will be competitively priced when it
launches over
and when you factor in the pricing I'm
reasonably impressed with the MSI model
we've been looking at today this new
1440p 144 hertz curved VA panel is
bringing higher quality high refresh
displays to cheaper price points and
that's what I love to see MSI's Mona
bring some unique features to the table
that could be surprisingly useful to
some people though I do wish the
calibration was a little tighter out of
the box and now for the good news for
those of you in Australia or New Zealand
