get 200 watts or more of output through
up front
welcome back to harbor unboxed today we
are doing a bit of unboxing haven't done
that for a while few of you have been
quite upset at me for not doing an
unboxing boxes episode but today I have
the perfect excuse because in this big
box here this one here I should have
AMD's new Raven Ridge CPUs if not that's
going to be a bit disappointing but I'm
sure that's what's in there because a
buddy said they've set them and as I
said it's a box from AMD if you don't
like unboxing videos well then I don't
even know why click to this because it
was quite clearly stated it was an
unboxing video so that one's kind of on
you anyway
let's get into this one first because I
have a few other things here have been
unboxing a few boxes without you guys so
I apologize for that
I didn't feel good about it but there
was a few things I had to unbox like
that there's a gtx 1080i tree over there
from msi I had to check that out
anyway again I apologize let's just get
to it it's a massive box for what should
be just two CPUs
all right actually here we go will do
will do this together so I didn't cut
that side there we go all right well
we've got some some sort of cardboard
paper filler stuff sorry if that was
really loud I just smashed the
microphone this should be a spare CPU
for something I need but in here
we are getting there I promise
tada that is pretty awesome I mean it's
just a box but I wasn't expecting that I
was just expecting too much smaller
boxes we've seen the box art aimed he's
already showing that off but yes we got
this cool custom kind of like a double
motherboard box sized box how do I open
it all right there we go
what are you saying oh yeah come on oh
cool little mini ITX motherboard that's
kind of neat and we've got some g.skill
Flair X memory this stuff's awesome
really good stuff this so that's a 16
gigabyte kit so that's worth a bit of
money these days and there we go that's
what I was expecting in there just these
cheap AMD have once again outdone
themselves with the unboxing experience
that's a very cool box but I think I'm
gonna fit it on my wall of boxes but
anyway we'll sit it off to the side for
the moment try to knock everything off
AMD look to have provided a nice little
USB stick AMD branded Verizon sort of
colored themed that'll no doubt have
drivers and things on it so this is a be
350 motherboard the gigabyte gaming
Wi-Fi
go over this too much but a neat little
be 350 mother more there we looked at
one from a sock that we did in a build
might do something with this board as
well and test it out and anyway that's
probably not why you guys are here so
let's get to that
I'll move the memory of site as well
because we've also checked out that
memory of the channel so the Raven Ridge
processes we have their rise in 320 200
G and the rise in five 2400 G just for
reference here is a typical Verizon
three-box
and there is the rise in 320 200 G box
so as you can see very similar deal
except this one does have the Vega GP or
the Vega graphics on board and you get
this nice little silver trim at the top
and one there as well that signifies
that so yeah and then of course we have
a little label up here that says this is
named e rise and three at 2200 G
processor with Vega graphics so for core
processor 3.7 gigahertz max boost 3.5
gigahertz base and you get a cooler
inside as expected given the size of the
Box rising 5 version very similar very
similar to the risin 5 1400 box for
example so let's open them up and see
what's inside I suspect a processor and
a cooler and it'll look very similar to
what we've seen before but hey it's kind
of new all right we'll start with the
2200 G so yes Wraith stealth cooler
exactly the same as the one we got with
the risin 312 hundred for example put
that back over there has a pre applied
Tim so that's nice one time only deal
that but yeah so there you go Wraith
self cooler and the CPU to see if you've
looks much like what you'd expect says
horizon 320 200 G so yeah Rosen 320 20 G
can't join your benchmarks yet they will
be coming on the 12th or for Australian
viewers that will be the 13th at 1:00
a.m. so today how keen you artists at
and see those benchmark results but if
you are that was that's when the video
will be live
and then we have the Verizon 520 400 G
again we get the Wraith stealth cooler
so same deal on the seat cooler front
and then the CPU itself also looks very
much the same except it says 20 400 G so
there you go Rison 520 400 G so that
pretty much concludes the unboxing
experience yet not terribly different to
what we did with Verizon seven five
three and now Raven Ridge rather than
three and five again just to go over it
quickly though Rison five 2500 G that
will cost you a hundred and seventy
dollars us should be about two hundred
and ten dollars Australian has four
cores
eight threads a three point six key base
frequency three point nine gigahertz
frequency two megabytes of l2 cache four
megabytes of l3 cache failure 11 GPU
which has 704 SPU's and they operate at
1,250 megahertz
ddr4 2933 memory and again that will be
February 12th so February 13th if you're
in Australia and then we have the
horizon 320 200 G $100 u.s. 140 dollars
Australian four cores four threads 3.5
gigahertz base 3.7 gigahertz boost two
megabyte l2 cache for megabyte l3 cache
Vega 8 512 SPU's and they operate at
1100 megahertz
with DD off and then it supports ddr4
2133 memory so yeah as far as your own
boxing goes a little bit uneventful the
box that AMD sent all the stuff in was
probably the highlight pretty cool I
mean these are cool I can't wait to test
them out really really keen to see what
the 2400 G has to offer I think this is
gonna be a super chip especially if the
paid graphics card pricing is at the
moment so that could be a really cool
chip on a mini ITX motherboard like that
and a tiny little PC could be an awesome
little gaming rig
very
cost-effective say it came to the
benchmarks you'll see those next week
but that pretty much concludes the
unboxing portion of our Raven Ridge
coverage we have a couple of other cool
products to look at and I think I think
I might have something pretty pretty
cool to me anyway and the guys have been
following the channel that might be
pretty cool as well so we'll get to that
eventually for those wondering this is
just a risin three 1,300 X CPU was
having a few issues with the one that I
have somebody sent out another one for
testing so I won't bother showing you
that all right let's clear out I'll
clear off this last box to my left we'll
see what's inside all right
I have no idea what we have here at all
so no okay I wasn't expecting that it is
the new X 399 tai chi or the X 399 M Tai
Chi M signifying micro ATX so this is I
believe the first and possibly the only
micro ATX X 300 motherboard in existence
right now okay luckily it's well padded
this looks quite comical the tr4 socket
on a micro ATX motherboard so there we
go and that is still a very large socket
looks even larger on a motherboard of
this size impressively large we still
have a quad channel memory support a
huge VRM heatsinks so that's good
they're sort of finned so they should
work reasonably well obviously test that
out I do plan to do a build with this a
micro ATX thread wrapper build so
that'll be a bit special we have three
m2 slots so they're one of the SSDs will
be up that way when I'll go down that
way and then want to go across there we
have three PCI Express time
16 slots and as you would expect with a
cpu with 60 available PCI Express Lanes
all three of them are wired at times
sixteen bandwidth so we've got eight
SATA ports there is a u dot to port it
looks like we have a pair of USB 3.0
headers a couple of legacy USB twos
there they've got their purity sound
fall on board it'll be probably an ALC
1220 codec looks like the CPU has a four
pin and an eight pin power input so
that's good and then I rounded the i/o
and we have eight USB 3.0 x' then a
three point one with a type C as well so
three point one type a and type C dual
Gigabit Ethernet
you got your Wi-Fi and Bluetooth there
is a BIOS flash back button legacy ps2
port five audio jacks optical audio out
yes so really well stocked mini ITX
board there it's also really heavy
because that tr4 socket your nothing
really on the back to speak of no I am -
is there anything tucked away there but
yeah very cool motherboard I have really
no information about this board at all I
didn't know it was incoming so I don't
know the price just had a quick look
can't actually find any information it's
not on sale yet doesn't even appear to
be on the asrock website at the point of
making this video so then it'll no doubt
pop up any day now any moment now but
yeah that's that it comes with a pair of
screws for well two screws for the m dot
two slots so only two not three a pair
of antenna one for the Wi-Fi one for the
Bluetooth Quick Start Guide driver CD
and a full-on manual you get four SATA
cables it looks like we've got a double
slot SLI connector then okay so this one
will allow you to go there very high
bandwidth bridges this will allow you to
go over a single slot and this one a
double slot so
yeah for those of you taking advantage
of SL light on this little board and of
course we have an IO shield so free
standard stuff there yeah very cool
board and I will be doing a build in and
a case that's under embargo so case I
can't talk about for have a cool micro
ATX case that I will be doing a build in
in the not-too-distant future well we've
got some pretty cool AMD related
products so far what's in this got
another big box this one's probably the
heaviest box that we've got so far
ah yes okay right so in the last episode
of unboxing boxes it was kind of like
Christmas presents special a few
companies had sent us varying Christmas
present type of things and video sent
some wooden Christmas ornaments so yeah
got some interesting stuff Corsair had
it sent this in time and I missed it it
was under a heap of boxes and I only
recently discovered it so yeah sorry
Corsair let's see what you sent me come
on you're a professional you can do it
look yeah I worked it out okay so we got
a Corsair catalog so I can pick out all
the things I want for builds and whatnot
so that's convenient we've got a little
letter here or I think they call
Christmas cards I don't know
Happy Holidays wishing all the best for
2018 forever art courser well thank you
everyone at Corsair I'll put that with
all my other Christmas cards yeah it
looks like we do have some goodies in
here we have a k70 RGB wool se keyboard
in white damn well silver not sure we'll
find out the moment that looks very cool
then we have some stuff here it would
make Oh
is okay we have a Corsair cap goes with
my my now I've got an asrock cap I got
that the last episode I could've got two
caps in the last episode but I've spread
them out across too so that's kind of
nice
we have is this a RGB headphone stand I
think it is and we have something else
in here okay
making a huge mess okay so I yep we have
the St 100 RGB a headphone stand so yeah
that's pretty cool I'll be able to put
my headphones on there and even though
my headphones aren't RGB now they'll
kind of feel like you know they're
modern and have a bit of RGB flair to
them so that's very nice what's in this
little box
I had a got to this a bit earlier my
Christmas tree would have been complete
well I mean I hang that somewhere in the
office until Christmas 2018 and won't be
able to use it it's kind of hypnotizing
okay there we go very nice thank you
Corsair for that except I'm going to
need to vacuum after this episode
oh wow that's a cool looking keyboard
I'll get some b-roll of that but uh yeah
white key caps silver aluminium backing
that looks very fancy indeed and if
you're after a white keyboard with a bit
of flair this will probably serve you
nicely okay all right we're getting
there
we are getting there we have a new
keyboard from coolermaster the master
keys MK 750 so for those of you
wondering this keyboard sells for should
be selling for one hundred and fifty
dollars aus and that works out to be
about a hundred and eighty dollars
Australian and the model I have comes
with cherry MX blue switches and I
believe this is an all RGB affair and
you even get an RGB light bar so that's
pretty cool all props and b-roll of that
so you guys can see it in all of its RGB
glory I think the light bar though is
across the front here behind I think
it's in this glossy strip which you
might not be able to see with that there
unless it runs across the top there
anyway you'll you'll have your answer
probably by the time you hear this me
waffling on because I'll provide beer
I'll so you know what I don't yet know
just probably isn't that surprising to a
lot of you definitely blue switches cool
a master say it's a minimalistic design
with floating keys and I would agree
with that
very realistic indeed minimalistic has a
removable soft wrist rest which it is
nice and soft on top and I would say it
feels quite nice
yep it feels quite nice I like that and
it does have a removable cable with a
type-c connector type-a at the other end
it is a braided cable so that's nice so
shaping up to be quite a nice keyboard
this price point we've got some
dedicated multimedia keys and they're
backlit so when the keyboard is well not
lit up you can't actually tell what they
are that's kind of neat
the anodized aluminium top plate feels
really nice and looks really nice should
be quite easy to clean even though we do
have floating keys here and yeah I
really love this removable sort of
Leverett wrist rest and the Magnetic
attachments awesome
that's immersive the keyboard really
well forget this out of the way you guys
can see that ya moves of the keyboard
really well and it's that's awesome I
really like that yeah and then the feet
they raise it up a that's actually nice
that's a good angle I like that Jesus I
really like this keyboard I'm keen to
give this a good go so $150 us obviously
haven't tested it properly yet but $450
us it seems like it's a really
well-built really well featured keyboard
so should be quite competitive this yeah
let you guys know what I think about it
in the comments below
and of course by now you would have seen
the b-roll which I'm yet to see but
hopefully it looks very impressive all
lit up and the body on the bottom also
looks cool with the wrist rest in place
alright so that's that down we have
something else to look at of course
in all of my excitement to get to the
Raven Ridge CPUs I completely forgot
there was another big box so we'll put
the Lego box which I'm sure isn't Lego
on pause and this one and we'll tackle
this big heavy box and see what's inside
some cool stuff here all right I finally
have got my hands on the nm axe
liquid-liquid Tek it is the tr4
280 millimeter all-in-one liquid cooler
basically - all in one design
specifically for thread Ripper CPUs so
it has complete 100% tr4 coverage or the
heat spreader coverage on the B thread
Ripper CPUs that sucker there sorry
let's take a quick look at that I will
be testing this on the channel I will be
using it in a build so I won't go into
too much detail right now other than to
say that it costs one hundred and forty
dollars u.s. and I have no idea what it
costs in Australia because it isn't
currently on sale here some big 140
millimeter fans the star of the show is
huge all in one or this huge water block
I should say with pump so the block has
a nice glossy black finish on top with
the nm acts name and then this is where
the magic happens we have a hundred
percent STR for IHS coverage.you so as
you can see a just massive massive
copper cold plate there so that'll work
hopefully really well so keen to test
that out this radiator looks really nice
I love the aluminium sort of trimmings
that are screwed on to the side there
they look pretty fancy probably won't
see them in a lot of cases but if you do
happen to see them they look really nice
much better than the sort of standard
sides you see on the radios and we got
some nice sleeved hoses which are nice
and flexible very flexible actually very
flexible actually
so that's good then we have a nice pair
of big 140 millimeter fans so they will
push plenty of air through that radiator
yeah as I said I won't go on about this
too much because I do plan to install
this and show it off in a build and test
it shortly
I might even be using it with that micro
ATX motherboard so that would actually
be a really cool combo and then we have
the Platinum DF power supply so platy
max DF platinum power supply and that is
ready for 1200 watts five-year warranty
and as you would imagine the platinum or
the 80 plus Platinum certified rating
means that it's 89 to 93 percent
efficient at 20 to 100 percent load and
this box is incredibly heavy so let's
get into it
probably well fit off I'd say the
coolest thing but a very cool thing
about this other than the fact that it
has a 1200 watt output and it's platinum
rated is the fact that it is all of
those things but also this size so and
by this size I mean it's only 160
millimeters long if I can get it out
there you go so if you saw that front
unlike that you probably wouldn't guess
that it's a 1200 watt Platinum rated
power supply very compact very neat that
would have gone well in that stupidly
crazy home theater well not home theater
PC build that be that crazy 18 quart
mini ITX Tower that I built recently not
that long ago I unboxed the see Sonic
platinum and I think this one is what's
this one rated this is a thousand watt
unit that's right so thousand watt unit
it's also platinum rated but as you can
see it's a whisker longer so it's not a
whole lot in it but you get Turner watts
more output from the NMX
unit and it is about I'd guess eight mil
shorter but whatever it's about a
centimeter short up 10 mil something
else really cool about this unit is in
this box here and it is the individually
sleeved cables they're black and white
and they come with plenty of combs
you can make a really nice neat build
with these you don't need you know you
don't need to pay extra money basically
for custom slave cables unless you want
a different color but black and whites
fairly neutral and should suit most
builds so that's really cool so it's
expensive power supply for 10 or 50
dollars u.s. but when you consider that
is platinum rate it does have a 1200
watt output and you don't need to buy
custom cables actually turns out to be
remarkably good value
so I'm also keen to use this in a built
and it will be going in that the same
build as the all-in-one liquid cooler
which hopefully will be with that micro
ATX X 399 motherboard okay and we have a
Star Wars Lego box here it's like Tim
sent me something to unbox maybe you did
I don't know who this is from but we
will find out what's in it in a moment
here we go the MSI X 399 gaming Pro
carbon a motherboard that I have already
unboxed
on unboxing boxes but I'll be using one
I'm using one of these the last one I
unboxed is for my custom PC which I'm
still working on I'm gonna paint the
Cougar clunker case and put it in that
when I get time and this one will be for
a different build that I'll be featuring
on the channel and it will probably be
replacing this background PC so there'll
be a new one they'll be building for
2018 and this board will be going in it
so that's what that's all about no need
to open it and show you at all again
we've done that before and now for the
final package of this episode of
unboxing boxes I apologize if it's been
extremely long but I thank you if you've
watched it this far
now I know who this was sent from so I
have a pretty good idea of what it is
but yeah we'll see if I'm right in a
moment with my suspicions
certainly one of the coolest things I've
unboxed and unboxing boxes you guys have
a pretty good idea what's in here let's
have a look yeah you guys have probably
heard that spiel a few times so we won't
bother with that but at least this part
is relatively unique to us
congratulations on passing 100,000
subscribers that's pretty cool I know we
did it a while ago now we're not too far
off to a thousand which is mind-blowing
but yeah that's crazy to actually have
it officially it's really nice so thanks
to everyone who subscribed thanks to
YouTube for sending this out and yeah
that's really awesome really cool I
better hang this up now and we did it we
got a hundred thousand subscribers so we
have to get about five times more now to
get another one of these so yeah see you
again sometime in the future hopefully
yeah thanks everyone for watching really
stoked about this can't wait to show Tim
alright guys well as always thank you
for watching sorry if it did drag out a
bit long but you know those those of you
who are fans of the series know that I
sort of waffle on and take my time with
the unboxing boxes yeah we saw the Raven
Ridge CPUs tons of testing to do now
I'll spend many many many days of
testing I have a lot of configurations I
want to test a lot of games I want to
test a lot of stuff I want to do so
you're gonna see a very very
comprehensive in-depth video on release
day which will be the 12th one a.m. for
Australians on the 13th we've got some
cool we've got a really cool motherboard
some cool and a max key that I'm
hopefully gonna make a very cool build
with some other stuff and of course the
play button so very very exciting
episode enjoyed it thoroughly hope you
guys did and on that note I'm yo Steve
