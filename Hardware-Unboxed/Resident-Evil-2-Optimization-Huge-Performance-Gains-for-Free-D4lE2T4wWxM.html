you hopefully would have seen steve's
big benchmark video looking at how
Resident Evil 2 performs with a large
number of GPUs the general consensus
seems to be that the game runs very well
on mid-range hardware with something
like the GTX 1060 or rx 570 offering
above 60fps at 1080p max settings the
gtx 1070 being good enough for 1440p and
the 1080 TI almost hitting 60fps at 4k
but there's also a lot of quality
settings in the game and in many cases
it's not necessary to run on the maximum
settings to get the best mix of
performance and visuals this is a
stunning game in general that uses a
wide variety of effects to deliver a
fantastic presentation however some
settings are particularly performance
intensive so in this video I'll be going
through every setting in Resident Evil 2
to show you how it impacts both visual
quality and performance I'll be making a
few recommendations along the way for
settings to turn down or tweak and then
at the end we'll compare maximum
settings with our custom settings
profile the goal is to gain as much
performance with as little reduction to
visuals either to allow those with lower
end cards to hit 60fps others with
faster cards to start pushing up to a
hundred plus fps a few bits of standard
housekeeping before we get into it all
testing was done on my core I $9.99
hundred K test rig with 16 gigabytes of
RAM and a variety of modern GPUs from
both AMD and NVIDIA with results average
all footage was captured at 4k using an
RT X 2080
and we recommend watching this video at
4k because it can be hard to spot the
differences in some settings at lower
quality levels on YouTube we also have a
full source quality file of this video
at 100 megabits available to download
for our patreon certain evil 2 seems
like one of those games that was
designed with PC in mind we're getting a
great selection of preset C in
conjunction with fairly basic visual
representations of each setting along
with bars that indicate the visual and
performance impact for people unfamiliar
with the settings this is a great sort
of menu to have the main annoyed
straight out here is the VRAM usage
indicator which can quickly
- well over 8 gigabytes depending on the
configuration you set when the amount of
rear am the game thinks it will be using
exceeds the amount of RAM you have
warnings will start to pop up I'm mostly
concerned about these warnings scaring
off gamers from trying higher quality
settings because as far as I can tell
exceeding the vram limit has no real
performance impact I happily gamed on an
8 gigabyte card with the game saying it
required more than 13 gigabytes of vram
on the max settings so the warnings are
a bit aggressive it's really only with
low-end cards those with 4 gigabytes of
vram or lower that it can have an effect
the other setting which may not be
obvious as to which mode is better is
the DirectX option Steve covered this in
his view yesterday the game runs
universally better in the DirectX 11
mode so there's no reason at all to use
DirectX 12
unless you enjoy I guess lower frame
rates for no difference in visuals so
for presets we have four different
options I'll be going through plus a
recommended mode that I won't cover the
four main presets are max graphics
priority balanced and performance
priority in a lot of scenarios there are
only very minor differences between Max
and bounced with small reductions to
volumetric lighting quality and shadows
it's only when you get down to the
performance priority mode that more
features begin to be disabled or toned
down including screen spaced reflections
and ambient occlusion it's also worth
mentioning there are still settings that
can be turned down below what is set
using the performance priority mode this
lowest mode has even further reduced
visuals but remarkably still looks quite
decent considering the changes my advice
here is pretty straightforward when
looking at performance most gamers
should use the bounced mode it delivers
31% more performance on average
straightaway with nearly a 50% uplift in
1% lower performance all for almost
imperceptible changes in visual quality
throughout many areas I tested if you
really want slightly better visuals even
then I would choose the graphics
priority mode over max settings simply
because I could not tell a difference
between the two rendering mode is a
setting our only touch on low-end
systems using the interlaced mode here
rather than normal results in noticeable
shimmering and artifacts as it's
essentially using a really crappy
temporal rake
instruction in motion it's even more
noticeable than in these static scenes
the benefits using interlaced rendering
is a 50% gain to performance however
again I'd make other tweaks before
turning this mode on anti-aliasing is in
my opinion the most disappointing
quality option in the game there are
five modes here SMA a TA a
fxaa and a combination of both taa and
fxaa plus of course no anti-aliasing
none of these options are particularly
amazing both taa and ta plus FXAA are
extremely soft due to a mediocre taa
implementation the detail loss is so
severe I'd call this a blur filter more
of an anti-aliasing SMA a preserves the
most detail but you do get some
shimmering lesser than FX a and off
however had the re engines taa being
half decent I think a combination of taa
and SMA like is used in some other games
would have struck a great balance
between detail and Jaggi reduction but
as is you have to either put up with a
super soft taa or not completely
adequate SMA aside from super sampling
through the resolution slider my choice
here would be SMA and I've used it
across the rest of testing as ta is
simply too blurry to spot some detail
changes booking your performance there's
no significant difference between SMA
and the two taa
options using FX a or no AAA delivers a
three to four percent performance
improvement but since SMA is visually
superior it gets my recommendation here
texture quality is a pretty crazy
setting in Resident Evil 2 because there
are so many options there are three base
texture modes we get high medium and low
but then there's also numerous vram
amounts listed beside these modes
presumably these VM numbers are an
indicator of how much we ramp the game
will use for textures with 8 gigabytes
allocating up to 8 gigabytes 2 gigabytes
allocating up to 2 gig and so on on an 8
gig card like the RT X 2080 there was no
performance difference between any of
the texture modes so whether I set the
game to 8 gigabytes or 0.25 gigabytes
there was no difference to either
average or 1% low performance at best I
saw a 1 to 2 percent improvement using
medium or low textures but of course the
8 high modes margins were so small they
were negligible and this was
the 8-gigabyte mode apparently using
more than 13 gigabytes of vram as I
mentioned before it's really only with
rear am constrained cards like the GTX
1063 gigabyte of this setting makes any
real difference for gamers with 6
gigabytes or more VM I'd recommend using
the high mode at 8 gig though if you
find there is stuttering it could be
worth turning down the vram amount
medium so virtually no loss to quality
and could be an option for those with 3
around limited GPUs while low is really
potato quality and I wouldn't recommend
it here texture filter quality is a
standard setting fan in most games here
we have anisotropic filtering ranging
from 2x to 16x plus both bilinear and
trilinear modes for low-end GPUs you'll
notice for these ground textures that
the higher the mode the further into the
distance you'll see clearer textures
with a non anisotropic modes being
particularly blurry across the mid-range
GPUs and up I saw at most a 1.5 percent
improvement switching from 16x and
isotropic to trilinear which is a
typical gain
however trilinear looks pretty mediocre
I'd recommend sticking to 16 times here
on everything but low-end GPUs mesh
quality is another one of those settings
that only has a significant impact with
low-end cards if you have a mid-range
GPU or up you shouldn't spot any
difference in performance between any of
the four modes I also didn't spot any
significant changes to visuals aside
from a minor loss in detail to some
models at the lowest setting I'd keep
this on max where possible the shadows
in Resident Evil 2 are some of the
game's best effects particularly the
shadows cast from the direct beam of
your torch it's the dynamic nature of
these shadows in dark environments that
adds to the atmosphere in a big way as
for shadow quality the only major change
I could spot between the 5 modes was in
the resolution of shadows in various
scenes where the cast from your torch or
other light sources there are only
slight differences between high and max
shadows with some slight losses to
resolution moving too high then when
shifting down to medium the resolution
downgrade becomes a bit more noticeable
the biggest changes in the move to low
shadows where the poor resolution really
starts to show then we have the min
shadow mode which has very earliest and
quite ugly shadows looking at the
performance differences you can group
things into three brackets at the top
max is the most intense
then high and medium both deliver
roughly three percent more performance
while low and minimum deliver a five
percent performance uplift my
recommendation here is to use the higher
mode you'll get roughly three percent
more performance on average than max
with only a very small change to shadow
quality and it's a good compromise to
make shadow cash appears to be a setting
that allows you to trade performance for
vram utilization with no noticeable
change to visuals turning the cash off
lowest VRAM usage in slightly at the
expense of a four percent reduction to
performance for almost every game are
leaving the setting on makes the most
sense it's only on vram constricted
cards we're swapping out information to
system memory all the time causes a
larger than four percent performance if
that you might consider turning the cash
off contact shadows is an extension of
the shadow system with this feature
enabled items in the scene can shadow
themselves from an incident light source
rather than just shadow the environment
around them in adds depth and realism to
the lighting system and depending on the
area can be noticeable in a subtle way
this is one of the more performance
intensive individual settings disabling
contact shadows improves performance by
4 percent on average for those with
powerful systems I'd recommend leaving
this setting enabled for the added
visuals but for those with more
entry-level GPUs is something I'd switch
off to gain additional performance next
up is screen space reflections a typical
effect used in many games Resident Evil
2 makes extensive use of SSR for both
water and shiny interior surfaces
however the implementation in my opinion
isn't great there's a lot of grain and
noise to reflections in some
circumstances indicative of I guess a
low sampling count surprisingly it looks
kind of like raytrace reflections with
the level of noise but obviously with a
more computationally simple technique to
make matters worse your character often
excuse the reflection so you get
noticeable I guess a seam between areas
with and without SSR I feel like another
reflection technique probably would have
been better here visually in any case
there's quite a substantial difference
between SSR on and off across the game
world it's a simple case of either there
are reflections of their art but the
world looks much more realistic with the
effect enabled despite the low sample
count in some areas however SSR also has
a huge performance impact
you'll gain more than 11% to your
framerate on average with the effect
disabled for those with beefy GPUs I'd
still recommend keeping SSR on for the
visual improvement it makes but on
performance constraint systems it's an
easy setting to turn off and even easier
setting to turn down is subsurface
scattering this is an effect that makes
a subtle difference to how character
models are rendered in particular skin
surfaces in close-up cutscenes but the
effect isn't all that noticeable in my
opinion and the effect comes with a
decent performance hit not just in
cutscenes but also in general play
disabling subsurface scattering needs to
a 4% improvement which I would recommend
doing volumetric lighting is the most
demanding setting in the game it also
helps establish a foggy atmosphere that
I feel is crucial to the experience
that's not to say the atmosphere is
terrible with the effect disabled just
that having volumetric lighting adds a
lot to this game in particular unlike a
game such as Assassin's Creed Odyssey
each of the three volumetric lighting
modes impacts the sampling count of the
effect with high having the densest haze
and the highest sampling count that said
there's no significant difference
between high and medium in my opinion
it's only when you switch to low that
you get a slight loss in quality
disabling the effect entirely also has a
huge impact on the visuals and I
wouldn't recommend this mode unless
you're running on low-end hardware in
terms of performance which in volumetric
lighting from high to medium is the
first and most obvious setting to change
in the game this provides a 12% uplift
average frame rates and a 25%
improvement to 1% low so the game will
also feel substantially smoother with
this small change if you're hunting for
a bit more performance I set this
setting too low particle lighting
quality changes where the particles
interact with light sources or not with
this setting enabled you'll see range
shimmer beneath street lamps for example
this effect has a minor impact on
performance disabling it gives an extra
1 to 2% so I really only recommend
disabling it if you're searching for
extra frames ambient occlusion is an
interesting one there are 4 modes plus
an off state split between three
techniques the most taxing setting is HB
AO plus then there's H Dao and then
there's two SSAO modes with one mode
limiting SSAO to certain
locations each of the three modes
renders ambient occlusion in a different
way giving a different effects which one
you like may be a personal preference
however I think
ssao looks best to my eye and SSAO is
the least taxing method delivering an 8%
performance uplift over HBO Plus while
HBO plus and H Dao are equivalent in
their performance this is an easy choice
to make unset the game to use SSAO and
enjoy the extra frames now we're moving
into more cosmetic and personal
preference settings starting with bloom
again this is something I feel adds to
the atmosphere considerably so I'd leave
it enabled however if you don't like the
effect I want around three percent more
performance it can be disabled lens
flare is a purely cosmetic feature there
is no difference in performance between
the two modes motion blur usually comes
down to personal preference on this I'm
playing at super high frame rates I like
to leave their setting enabled most of
the time however you will gain four to
five percent more performance with a
disabled due to the re engine's decent
motion blur implementation depth of
field is another effect that has no
impact on performance which is the same
with lens distortion and film noise
personally I'd turn lens distortion off
film noise is subtle enough that you'll
barely notice it whether it's enabled or
not while I'd leave depth of field
enabled so as for our overall
recommendation I've essentially built
two profiles here one I'll call hub
graphics for those with beefy systems
that want this game working great and a
hub performance mode that is more geared
towards maximum frame rates the hub
graphics mode has most settings
maximized with a few exceptions
I've told anti-aliasing from FXAA + ta
to just SMA for a sharper presentation
I've also turned shadows to high
subsurface scattering is disabled
volumetric lighting is on medium and
ambient occlusion is said to SSAO
this fairly modest set of changes
delivers a 31% performance improvement
over maximum settings for effectively no
change to visual quality in fact with
the change to anti-aliasing I'd say this
preset actually looks better than the
max preset which uses
taa + FX AAA our custom hub graphics
mode performs around the same mark as
the bells preset but with noticeable
changes our preset has better texture
filtering sharper shadows higher mesh
quality and full ssao
which
come at little to no performance cost
aside from those free bonuses the main
change is swapping a subscript the
scattering for increased volumetric
lighting quality which I feel has a
larger visual impact in general gameplay
our hub performance preset is really
geared towards maximizing frame rates
delivering and over 80 percent boost
compared to max settings and that tends
to be higher on more entry-level cards
as VRAM usage also declines this preset
is the same as hub graphics except for
several things disabled contact shadows
screen space reflections bloom and
motion blur are all turned off while
particle lighting and volumetric
lighting are set to low again this
preset performs slightly worse than the
performance priority mode however the
performance priority mode has several
things set to their lowest values
including shadows mesh quality and
ambient occlusion with that custom Hub
preset we're still using high shadows
maximum texture filtering SSAO and SMA
which all improved visuals with only
minor performance hits here's a brief
summary of the two presets in case you
want to use them maybe pause here
because in a second or so I'll be moving
right along in general I think it's
quite difficult to make Resident Evil to
look bad even with the lowest possible
settings selected the game still looks
good and runs even better than it
already does having such a large
difference in performance between
maximum and minimum quality settings
also allows a wide variety of PC games
with all sorts of configurations to
enjoy this game so it's both a fantastic
looking game and one that scales well
which points to a very high core the
effort on the PC version without
collection of optimal settings we're
looking at a 30 percent performance
uplift compared to maximum settings for
no noticeable quality loss this brings
GP used like the rx 580 and the GTX 1060
into calculations for high quality 1440p
60fps experiences which is a great
result for mid-range GPUs and that's
credit's a Capcom for their work on this
title that's it for this investigation
into Resident Evil 2 if you missed
Steve's big GPU benchmark please go back
and watch that it's definitely worth it
as always you can subscribe for more
graphics optimization videos looking at
the schedule I guess the next game
getting this treatment will likely be I
think it's Metro Exodus so stay tuned
