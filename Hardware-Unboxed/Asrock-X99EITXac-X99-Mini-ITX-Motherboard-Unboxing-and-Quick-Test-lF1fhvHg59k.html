unboxed I'm your host Matt and today
we've got the privilege of looking at a
very special motherboard we've got as
rocks x99 e ITX AC as rocks x99 e ITX AC
is their first ever motherboard to use
the x99 chipset on the mini-itx platform
which makes this product pretty unique
and special this is something you
would've thought was impossible not too
long ago but as rocks really pulled it
off the made it works so well in fact
that you get to look forward to premium
features like wireless AC USB 3.1 SATA
Express and m2 support the only real
trade-off of having the LGA 2011 socket
on the Mini ITX form factor is that
you're limited just two sticks of RAM
which rules out the quad channel feature
of the LGA 2011 version three processors
but is it really a significant trade-off
in the real world I'm going to
investigate and find out a little later
but for now let's pull it out of the box
and see how as rockers crammed all these
features onto such a tiny board so we've
got a set of instruction manuals first
one software second one is the quick
installation guide which is plenty thick
good accustomed liquid cooling mounting
bracket standard i/o panel the USB to
USB 3 adapter in case your case only
supports USB 2 at the front with the
Wi-Fi antenna and Bluetooth antenna
longer than extension cables your PCI
Express wireless a SD card and the
mounting bracket for it with just two
SATA cables even though the board
supports more in this box is the bundled
CPU cooler
let me finally get to the board itself
alrighty so let's take a look down the
i/o panel so starting on the right we've
got your five audio jacks and optical
output just next to that we've got the
two USB 3.1 ports we've got four USB 3
ports and to give it LAN ports we've got
your Eastsider next to that CMOS reset 2
USB 2 slots and a ps2 legacy port we've
got four ninety degrees mounted Saida
ports in the bottom right corner
alongside the PCI Express x 16 port just
underneath the CPU is the m2 slot that
can take cards up to 80 mm or like this
one as space is tired on the mini ITX
platform as rockers opted to use in the
narrow ilm LGA 2011 - three socket means
slightly longer much thinner than the
standard square socket you've also got
the option of water cooling with
coolness is sold in 120 V + or 120 V
closed-loop CPU liquid coolers for those
that don't want to shower out for an
aftermarket cooler as rocks got you
covered with the previously mentioned
Dinah Tron one would air cooler so this
is how it sits on the board for
installation the fan needs to be removed
and all four screws need to be secured
to the board the two ddr4 dimm slots are
pretty snug against the CPU socket here
but you can still fit large memory
modules like the HyperX predator the one
concern we have with this board was that
only supports dual channel memory and
this could hurt performance as the f99
platform is meant to run a quad channel
memory yet despite enormous 40% drop in
memory damage when compared to quad
channel boards this allows rock wasn't
any slower at all and the core i7 59 60
X delivered virtually the same results
with dual channel memory as a dude quad
channel we tried a number of application
and encouraging benchmarks and found
absolutely no difference at all
obviously the same is true in gaming the
bundled CPU cooler was quite loud and
with a fan
turn down the normal levels the 5960 X
did get up to about 90 degrees cooling
turned out to be pretty much a non-issue
as well and it'll be even less of an
issue if you choose to go with a liquid
cooler features wise you ain't really
missing out on anything which is pretty
damn impressive for a mini ITX
motherboard
overall the x99 ATX AC is an amazing
achievement by us rock and it truly
redefines what's possible on the Mini
ITX platform currently retail price
instead of 250 US I'm considering the
most x99 boards do start at around 200
us this is a pretty unique design with
premium pages I'd say it is pretty
reasonably priced it's definitely a
great option for anyone that does want
to build a pretty ridiculous mini ATX
system for example here's that build
that we used to test the board using the
silverstone ft0 one this compact system
also has a GTX Titan X installed so it's
a seriously powerful mini ITX gaming
machine lastly here's how the complete
system compares and size to a standard
ed 97 ATX motherboard thanks for tuning
into Hardware own box we hope you guys
liked it as rocks to take on the mini
ITX platform if you did hit like he'd
subscribe and we'll see you next time
yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
