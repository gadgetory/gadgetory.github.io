checking out Warhammer vermintide - or
more specifically we're looking at the
kind of performance you can expect to
see using a wide range of GPUs and if I
latest poll is anything to go by it
seems like it's a game you guys really
want us to check it out before we get
into the benchmark results though
today's video has been sponsored by a
Corsair and their impressive new range
of hydro series all in one liquid
coolers the new pro models are available
with either a 280 millimeter or 360
millimetre radiator and both deliver
exceptional performance with an almost
silent operating volume for more
information please check the link in the
video description for those of you
unaware of vermintide 2 was released a
few weeks ago by developer slash
publisher fat shark on March 8 and it's
a follow up to 2015 s Warhammer
end-times vermintide the game wasn't
really on our benchmark radar so we just
skipped it but last Friday I decided to
pick it up on Steam and add it to the
games that we're currently benchmarking
GPUs within 2018 after giving it a quick
guy on Friday I was super impressed with
how well it played and how great it
looked the game's built upon the
Autodesk stingray engine previously
known as the bit squid engine the
developer says that they have been
constantly updating the game engine
since the release of the first
vermintide title and this has enabled
them to deliver better optimization
improving how they utilize both the CPU
and GPU we often hear about how a
developers focus on optimization for the
PC and then the game turns out like a
bit of a pub G this though isn't the
case with vermintide - the optimization
here really is next-level they've also
added support for DirectX 12 and will
discuss which API you should use later
in the video other new features and
enhancements include volumetric lighting
and fog which provides a lot of depth to
the environments texture streaming
provides superior texture handling of
credit detail and a new fluid system
that enables liquids to spread naturally
over the environments and the developers
harnessed this to create some amazing
looking napalm at like effects the
game's been designed to take advantage
of core heavy CPUs and things like
animations particle effects culling and
physics are all spread across as many
cores as possible as you'd expect
DirectX 12 support also
we'll call overhead and further improves
CP utilization for now though I'm
focusing on the GPU performance but will
certainly cover the CPU side of things
in a future video and likely add this
title to our arsenal of games that we
used to test the latest and greatest
CPUs for testing vermintide 2 I've
decided to use the key pub there's no
combat here but the GPU performance is
similar to that other missions it's also
the same as the prologue it just doesn't
take two minutes to get into so for
benchmarking a truly massive amount of
graphics cards the keep up just makes
the most sense the past lasts for 60
seconds I'm reporting the 1% low and
average frame rates from an average of 3
runs most of the testing will be done
using the extreme quality preset but
I've also got some medium quality
results with some older graphics cards
as well as always the latest AMD and
NVIDIA display drivers available the
time of testing have been used and the
game version used for testing is 1.0 0.4
0.1 additionally all graphics cards were
tested in our Corsair GPU test rig and
inside we have a core i7 87 ROK clocked
at 5 gigahertz with 32 gigabytes of
vengeance ddr4 3200 memory this allows
us to minimize system bottlenecks and
show you the true performance of each
GPU also please note all testing has
been conducted using the DirectX 11 API
and before the AMD fans turn red with
low-level rage just hear me out
those with a GeForce GPU will see a 5 to
10 percent performance uplift when using
DirectX 11 in favor of DirectX 12 it's
probably not too many surprises there
now I was expecting to test the Radeon
GPUs using DirectX 12 but as it turns
out this actually puts AMD at a bit of a
disadvantage using the core i7 test rig
which isn't CPU bound the Radeon GPUs
suffered up to a 15% reduction in frame
time performance when using DirectX 12
instead of DirectX 11 although the
average frame rate was much the same the
weaker one percent lower results looked
pretty bad so I opted to use DirectX 11
instead now if you have a lower end CPU
then DirectX 12 might help improve
performance but we're not restricted by
the CPU DirectX 11 looks like the way to
go for this title right now that I've
clearly explained the situation I expect
we'll see no irate comments
about using radio and GPS with DirectX
11 now that it's safe to proceed let's
get into the benchmark results as we
often do let's start with the previous
generation GPUs but please note as usual
we're skipping the RX 400h because the
RX 500 series is just the same deal with
some factory overclocking so let's not
waste any time testing the
fourth-generation GCN parts twice here
we see some very promising performance
at turn DP using the maximum in-game
quality settings the gtx 960 and r9 380
were able to deliver playable voice over
30fps at all times in our test ideally
though for these quality settings gamers
will want a gtx 970 or r9 390 and both
did push over 60 FPS for the most part
then as we increase the resolution of
1440p the r9 380 and gtx 960 fall into
unplayable territory as you'd probably
expect still the r9 390 and GTX 970
provided a decent experience but the
game was noticeably more responsive with
the gtx 980 and r9 390x
meanwhile the gtx 980ti beat the fury ax
quite easily and we've pretty much come
to expect that it is the king of the
previous generation GPUs after all as
good as vermintide whose optimization is
you're not going to be on a play using
the maximum quality settings at 4k that
said the performance with the gtx 980ti
was impressive
and with a few tweaks to the quality
settings it shouldn't be that hard to
achieve playable performance now let's
move on to the current generation GPUs
and here we see games need only a gtx
1050 Ti though it has to be said the RX
570 proved to be a significantly better
choice in this title delivering a
whopping 40% more frames the gtx 1060
and RX 580 were neck-and-neck that was
interesting to see vega 56 pulling ahead
of the gtx 1070 and wasn't that far
behind the 1070 TI the air-cooled vega
64 GPU did struggle against the gtx 1080
and it took the expensive liquid-cooled
model to take the lead
bumping the resolution up to 1440 piece
or surprisingly good performance from
the gtx 1060 and irx 584 silky smooth
performance though with no input lag the
gtx 1070 or Vega 56 will be required
then we see vega 64 neck and neck with
the 1070 TI
while the liquid cool
version was able to match the GTX 1080
then as expected the Pascal tight next
in GT X 1080 CI destroyed everything
else with well over 100 FPS on average
moving to 4k the experience with the
1080 TI was very nice you could only
just tell that it was dropping below 60
fps at times but it was still a very
smooth and playable experience even the
1070 in Vega 56 were playable though you
will want to tweak the quality settings
a little bit to bump those frame rates
up now just quickly here's all 33
current and previous generation GPUs at
1080p crammed into a single graph as you
can see for the most part we were able
to keep the frame rates above 40 fps at
all times which is impressive given the
visual quality 5 GPUs were dropped from
the 1440p testing as they were way too
slow but you could also cut out anything
under the r9 380 X the GTX 1060 rx 580
GTX 980 and r9 390x are the bare minimum
you can get away with when using the
extreme quality preset at 1440p then at
4k just 18 current and previous
generation GPUs were tested but even
then you could drop half of the cards I
did test anyway not much more really can
or I suppose needs to be said here so
let's move on to check out some of the
old bangers digging into the bargain bin
we find some real gems for playing
vermintide 2 at 1080p with modest
quality settings here the GTX 650 - I
was able to deliver play performance
while the Radeon r7 260x was actually
quite good as was the gtx 750ti
beyond that we're pushing over 60fps on
average so the experience was great on
the r7 370 and gtx 660ti for example for
a minimum of 60 FPS you'll only require
the Radeon HD 7950 though from Nvidia
the GTX 680 is needed still for a game
that looks very visually impressive
vermintide 2 has proven to be very
hardware friendly overall Warhammer
vermintide 2 looks to be a great quality
game visually it's very impressive and
best of all it's actually optimised on
the PC with a mid-range graphics card
you really can enjoy it with all the eye
candy turned up and this is one of the
few triple-a titles we've tested to date
that plays perfectly at 4k with
single high end GPU graphics card I also
really appreciate the fact that it works
well on both AMD and NVIDIA hardware the
fact that there's no developer bias
going on here is likely a big part of
why the game is actually well optimized
in the near future I'm very keen to
explore CPU performance as well and
given what I saw with the core i7 8700 K
expect this title will play very well on
rising systems and this is something I
will be investigating using both the
DirectX 11 and DirectX 12 api's for now
