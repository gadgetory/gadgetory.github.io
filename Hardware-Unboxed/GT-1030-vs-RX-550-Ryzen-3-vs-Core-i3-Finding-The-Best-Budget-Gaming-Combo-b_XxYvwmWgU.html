we're getting all excited about AMD's
Raven Ridge desktop AP using with good
reason well they should be very good but
we won't know officially for a few more
days yet in preparation for some of our
coverage we've spent a huge amount of
time retesting a number of CPU and GPU
combinations to such combinations
include the horizon 3 1300 X in the core
i3 8100 both of which have been tested
with the GeForce GT 10:30 and Radeon rx
550
I felt the results were worth analyzing
separately and I figured quite a few of
you would probably agree with me and be
interested in taking a look so I thought
let's do that I've also thrown in the G
45 60 but it's only been tested with the
GT 1030 but again I figured you'd
appreciate seeing those results so I've
included them in total there are nine
games that have been tested and we've
done so at 720p and 1080p using playable
settings so not necessarily competitive
settings for the eSports titles but
playable settings all the same please
note the core i3 8100 that was tested
using ddr4 2400 memory because it's a
locked part while the Rison 3 1300 X was
tested with 3200 memory as it's an
unlocked CPU though I should note there
is no overclocking featured in this
video on the CPU side then finally the G
45 60 was paired with ddr4 2133 memory
as that is the fastest memory you can
pair this processor with on a non
overclocking motherboard right then
let's get to the results first up we
have pub G at 720p using the low quality
preset and this is allowed for over 60
FPS on average for all the tested
configurations using the rx 550 and GT
1060 performance wise both GPUs did
deliver a similar experience and we can
see the dual chord G 45 60 hanging in
there quite well with the newer quad
cores then at 1080p we see the GT 1030
providing slightly better results with
the Intel CPUs though when testing both
GPUs with the Rison 3 1300 X we do see
similar results that said neither
allowed for optimal performance
frame rates in the 40s of course it was
playable just not that desirable next up
we have fortnight Battle Royale and here
we see the rx 550 is a little bit slower
when paired with the core i3 8100 a pose
to the GT 1030 we see a small margin for
the 1% low results with the rise in
three 1300 X but the average frame rate
with both GPUs was the same then we have
the G 45 60 which does very well pulling
ahead of the core i3 8100 though I
should note the results are within the
margin of error and remember this is a
multiplayer title and although the
results are based on an average of three
runs the margin of error is higher than
that of more controlled single player
titles then it's an EPS the Rison three
1300 ex that sees the RX 554 behind
though we also see this with de core i3
8100 but to a lesser degree particularly
when looking at the 1% lo results again
the G 4560 does very well delivering
comparable performance to that of the
core i3 8100 moving on we have the csgo
results and this title is simply better
optimized for Intel hardware we can
certainly see that here the rise in 3
1300 X puts forth a respectable effort
but the core i3 8100 was at least 40%
faster when comparing the 1% low results
that said the Radeon rx 550 does appear
to have the edge over the GeForce GT
1030 in this title and the r3 1300 X
while they want to beat the Pentium G
4560 then once we move to Tony P this
strongly favors the rx 550 an out up to
13% faster than the GT 1030 the margin
between the r3 1,300 X and I 381 here is
pretty much neutralized due to the GPU
bottleneck this has also allowed the G
4560 to catch up overwatch heavily taxes
both the CPU and GPU during our bot
match and here we see risin taking a
commanding lead the 1300 X stormed ahead
offering significantly better 1% low
performance particularly in power of the
rx 550 which proved to be a superior GPU
when using the medium quality preset at
720p meanwhile the core i3 8100 saw much
lower frame dips and created a
bottleneck that almost eliminated any
performance difference between the two
GPUs interestingly the dual called G
4560 also wasn't much slow in the core
i3 8100 here if I decide say the higher
clocked ddr4 memory is giving the rise
in 3 1300 X an advantage in this time
even at 1080p the r3 1300 ex remains
strong and while the margins are closer
it still pulls ahead nicely with the rx
550 installed the rx 550 also proved to
be 10% faster than the GT 1030 next up
we're chasing a giant ball or maybe it's
a small ball and we're using Hot Wheels
cars either way what we have here is
rocket League if you want to play rocket
League at higher frame rates then the rx
550 looks to be the graphics card to get
I'm not sure what's holding back the GT
1030 here but as you can see it is
significantly slower even at IEP the
margins still quite large and we did see
this last year when comparing the two at
1080p using the low and high quality
presets interestingly the r3 1300 X does
quite poorly with the GT 1030 while it's
very strong with the rx 550 so that's
something to be aware of as well moving
on we have dota 2 and this title looks
to be best played using intel hardware
here the core i3 8100 was considerably
faster for both the average and 1% low
figures even the G 4560 managed to edge
out the rise and CP and offered far
better 1% lower results interestingly
the GT 1030 was much faster than the rx
550 with the i3 8100 but slightly slower
when paired with the rise and 3
processor then a turnip here we find a
coming together of the results though
things are still a bit mixed here mostly
when looking at the rise and three 1300
acts the GT 1030 was 10% faster for the
average about 8% sly for the 1% low
result meanwhile the G 45 60 basically
matched the core i3 8100 here we have
another game with the rx 550 is vastly
superior to the GT 1030 over 20% faster
in fact for budget gamers wanting to
play Rainbow six siege it looks like
Intel CPUs with AMD GPUs is the way to
go that said the horizon 3 1300 X does
do quite well with the rx 550 similar
margins are seen at 1080p here the GT
1030 limits all three CPUs to a similar
average and minimum frame rate the
horizon 3 1300 X is also able to get the
most out of the rx 550 the second last
game I've tested a Star Wars Battlefront
2 and here the rx 550 was slightly
faster than the GT 1030
the core i3 8100 was also 12 to 16
percent fast and the Rison 3 1,300
apparently 1% lower results that said
the rise in CP was world's better than
the Pentium G 45 60 fill at 1080p the rx
550 remain comfortably ahead using
either CPU and now the rise and three
1300 X is able to match the core i3 8100
as we are GPU limited here that said
this situation didn't afford the G 45 60
the ability to catch up then finally for
the AMD fans were wrapping things up
with Wolfenstein - the new Colossus and
this one's gone pretty much as expected
even at 720p the GT 1030 is overwhelmed
even with the low quality preset enabled
here it can't even deliver 60 FPS on
average the GT 1030 obviously shouldn't
be this much slower than the rx 550 but
I've triple-checked the results and they
are accurate which is why I'm confident
enough to show them to you guys
I tried disabling acing compute with the
GT 1030 but that didn't really help at
all
so Wolfenstein fans will obviously want
a Radeon graphics card and the choice of
CPU doesn't really appear to matter all
that much and this isn't that uncommon
with Vulcan based titles moving Itali
pcs the GT 1030 unable to deliver play
performances frame rates often dip below
30fps the rx 550 on the other hand was
able to push over 50 FPS at all times
when paired with the core i3 8100 which
provided the best results every time I
do these budget benchmark videos I
always find myself coming away quite
impressed with the performance that can
be had granted with newer titles you
have to play at lower resolutions with
lower settings but I don't suspect many
budget gamers will be surprised by this
and really the experience is still a lot
of fun particularly in titles such as
dota 2 csgo fortnight and overwatch
although both GPUs and CPUs test to
provide a playable performance for the
most part particularly at 720p it was
very much game dependant as to which
combination offered the best result for
csgo we found that ideally gamers will
want an Intel quad core the GPU choice
though that didn't really seem to matter
though Nvidia did have a slight edge
here
dota 2 also played best with Intel and
NVIDIA Hardware that said though
overwatch played noticeably better with
the Rison three 1300 X and rx 550 combo
it was also interesting to note the 1300
X performance better with the rx 550
entail such as dota 2 and puppy
whereas the opposite
true for the core i3 processor the only
games to show outrageous margins
included rocket League and Wolfenstein 2
rocket League much preferred the rx 550
over the GT 1030 and this was also true
for when Stein - the rx 550 was also a
good bit faster Rainbow six siege as
well overall though a great experience
that we had with either quad core CPU
and of course I'm very keen to see how
AMD's new Rison 320 200 G and Rison 520
400 G build upon this and what they have
to offer for budget gamers and of course
that will be happening in a few days
time for now though it's back to
benchmarking but I hope you enjoyed this
