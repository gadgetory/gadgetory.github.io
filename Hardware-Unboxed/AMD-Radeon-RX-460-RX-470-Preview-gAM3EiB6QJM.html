flooded with expensive high-end GTX 1080
and 1070 graphics cards but believe me
guys I do love the Affordable mid-range
to low-end stuff as well over the years
I've spent my fair share of time playing
with the budget GPUs so I'm excited to
be talking about the RX 460 and act for
17 these are of course the younger
siblings of the hype machine that is the
RX for Eddie those hoping not to break
the bank on their next graphics card
purchase may well be looking into one of
these two products will start from the
bottom drake style with the RX for 60
this one's particularly interesting
because it's the first car being
released that will use a playa sleeve
and chip which AMD hope will be powering
the portable gaming market tuned to the
460 is touted as their esports gaming
card many of suits games that I'm very
demanding but it's still extremely
popular like League of Legends dota csgo
rocket League and the like for a company
seeking to reclaim market share having
the best value option for these games
that are the most popular in the world
seems like a great strategy the Polaris
11 GPU used will employ 14 compute units
for 896 stream processors 48 TM use and
16 arrow keys and the clock speed to be
set at a beach frequency 1090 megahertz
but will be able to boost as high as
twelve hundred megahertz the result is
2.2 teraflops of compute performance
when boosted the RX 460 will be
available in either 2 gigabyte or 4
gigabyte capacities using gddr5 memory
clocked at 1750 megahertz which provides
7 gigabits per second throughput
performance that said a slim 128-bit y
memory bus is being used and the memory
bandwidth is limited to just 112
gigabytes per second finally this is
expected to be a 75 watt max part so it
shouldn't even require a 6-pin PCIe
power connector in terms of performance
I'm expecting the RX for 60 DB slightly
faster than the Radeon r7 370 in fact it
should slot right in between the 370 and
370 x those models released with an MSRP
of 150 and 180 us respectively today the
most affordable r7 370 cards cost 120
bucks so I expect the RX 462 coming in
around a hundred dollars hopefully a
little south of that figure now looking
to the RX 470 the smallest flies 10-part
here we fight
a GPU with 32 compute units enabled this
means in total there are 2048 SP us
along with 128 TM use and 32 are Opie's
that's just an eleven percent reduction
in cords when compared to the RX for 80s
so I don't expect the RX for Sony to be
a great deal slower the AMD
specification see the RX for seven
o'clock to just five percent slower as
well when comparing the booze clocks the
base clock has been set in 928 megahertz
but it can boost up to 1200 six
megahertz depending on the workload this
means it's up to 4.9 teraflops to
compute power and offer or 3.8 teraflops
we're not raining at the base frequency
it appears they'll only be a 4 gigabyte
option for the RX 470 which in my
opinion is great news this GPU will be
too slow to utilize an a giga byte
buffer while it's too fast to be paired
with just 2 gigabytes of memory the
gddr5 memory is clocked at just 16 50
megahertz though which will allow for a
throughput of up to 6.6 gigabits per
second the same 256-bit memory bus of
the RX 480 is of course being used here
so the bandwidth is rather impressive
211 gigabytes per second the RX 470 is a
120 watt part which is rather large
twenty percent reduction from the RX for
eddie i assume we'll see a single 6-pin
PCI power connector on the same day
reference card now in terms of
performance I don't expect the RX 470 to
be more than ten percent slower than the
RX for 80s mentioned the average could
quite possibly be even less this means
we should again be seeing I know 390
like performance the arcs 470 will
certainly be faster than the I know 380
x given the 4 gigabyte r x 480 is a
two-hundred-dollar part it would make
sense to see the arcs 470 prices around
170 dollars quite a few people are
suggesting an MSRP of 150 bucks at that
price I feel AMD would risk
cannibalizing their own sales of the RX
for Eddie still if this is true it'll be
amazing news for those on the hunt for a
sub $200 GPU what do you guys think of
these upcoming AMD parts let me know in
the comments I'm Yost matters always and
I'll see you guys next time youtubers
