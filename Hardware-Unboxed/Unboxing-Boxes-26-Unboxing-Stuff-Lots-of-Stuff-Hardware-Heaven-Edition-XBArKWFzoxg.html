unboxed for another episode of unboxing
boxes where I unbox things from boxes
not a lot of mystery as to what's in
this box to my right or this box to my
left clearly an IRC monitor and a
Coolermaster case so the fun's a bit
spoil there but anyway it'll be fun to
unbox those products and have a look at
the product itself these three boxes
here no idea what's in them so a bit of
excitement there I don't think it's
going to be a pair of 1080 TI graphics
cards like it was on last week's episode
or a pair of rx5 80s so finally set the
standard a bit high on that last episode
I probably should have spread them out
but anyway didn't know what was in them
didn't know we're going to get a heap of
graphics card and a couple of cool
motherboards with that Rison v processor
so yeah I don't think we're going to
pull anything off like that again but
we'll see we have alright let's start
with the figure of the three see what we
have in here it's a very very heavy box
this one so no idea what we have well we
have some level hundred Tetris masters
working for Coolermaster that's an
impressively packed box there they
definitely could not have got much more
in there this stuff is for a
Coolermaster horizon 5 build that I will
be doing I've been wanting to do this
for a while now and
coolermaster have been getting the bits
to me as you can see they've done it so
we've got the case over there which
we'll look at shortly but in here it
looks like we've got some fans power
supply liquid cooler and some thermal
paste that's not necessarily for the
bill that was just low on thermal paste
I was like hey give me some thermal
based and they did alright then we'll
paste unboxed will set the biggest item
out probably one of the heaviness okay
it's what we have here is cooler masters
master liquid pro 280 I knew that
you ready okay dangerous do not eat
noted okay so here we have it the master
liquid Pro to 80 as you can see it's a
very big radiator designed to take a
pair of 140 millimeter fans which we
have here and the fans themselves are
very impressive I'll get to them in a
moment the radiator is very interesting
as I it's a square thin design so rather
than have sort of the the v-groove fins
we have square fins on this radiator it
looks looks very neat very cool very
different I'll do some close-up brl so
you guys can have a look at what I'm
talking about
before we get to the radiator actually
something is really impressive these
tubes they're extremely flexible so if
you had the radiator say mounted in the
top of your case like that this flexes
around really easily to go onto you
actually I'm showing this the wrong way
around yes so as I was saying top of the
case and then you can see how easily
those pipes just flex so you can sort of
have it you know if the CPU the socket
was there or there it sort of goes
around really easily and they swivel as
well the arms here so they swivel quite
easily so yeah it shouldn't be too hard
to get that pretty much anywhere it's a
massive pump assembly here looks very
cool I believe inside here we have PE no
I think it's fep tubing don't quote me
on that I can't remember what it stands
for anyway it is I believe a ribbed type
of tubing so that's why it flexes so
well and doesn't collapse in on itself
so that's very cool
the RHIB tubing though is a bit ugly it
doesn't look particularly good
especially for the guys that you know -
all the custom builds so they've put the
sleeving over it which you can feel the
the ribbed tube under it looks a lot
nicer I think that
40-millimeter version of this didn't
have the sleeving so if you have a look
online you'll see the difference or what
the tubing looks like that was leaving
on anyway I think that looks very neat
and tidy and they've just got like the
heat shrink at either end now to finish
it off which looks fine anyway so much
more to say about that right so we have
this very industrial looking radiator
square radiator looks extremely heavy
duty and well reinforced it looks like
it's got its baffled so down the middle
is basically split down the middle
so the hot water would come in this tube
here that would be all sort of warmer
water cooling as it comes down this side
so they go up however many runs there
are say 10 of those flat tubes it would
go up there comes up the top here and
then it comes down there hopefully a lot
cooler then goes in this pipe again
cools the CPU down and yeah repeat all
over again so that's how that works the
technical description of how it works
anyway so it's did a quick bit of
research and the fep tubing last longer
than rubber apparently and it has less
absorption so see it's also a bit more
durable and that's why they've used it
and like I said the rib design also
means that flex as well so that's very
cool then you can get some seriously
tight bends out of that without a
kinking it's quite incredible really now
I'm not even trying there and then it
bends back quite well banging that
around a bit so apart from that
industrial really thick strong looking
design as I said it's got square fins
rather than the sort of V grooved I
suppose you would call them and I think
I mean I don't really know but I think
the advantage of those is you have more
contact points more contact surface area
on the flat tubes so it will dissipate
heat more efficiently from the tubes
into the fins and the fans will blow air
through them cools it all down it works
better I'm sure and then you know down
at the I suppose the business end of it
so you've got a nice copper base there
it's got a machined out square here
which would go on
CPU it looks like it'll support pretty
much every CPU out there I'd say you've
got all the LGA 2011 stuff all the a.m.
for staff the mainstream Intel's so
plenty of support it's an interesting
design this pump so you can see you've
got a clear cover showing off sort of
the plump the plump the pump housing the
mouldings and whatnot and it's split
into two chambers so the bottom chamber
you've obviously got the fins that would
be on the other side of the base the
copper fins in there and the water
actually comes in the top here and they
want the idea is to separate the cool
water from the radiator from the hot
water helps the pump last longer anyway
the cool water goes on the top the pump
obviously is doing its thing by sucking
it in and then pumping it out it goes
through this external tube here into the
base goes floods through there cools
down the fins in there and comes out
here and obviously that's just a
continuous cycle quite interesting looks
pretty cool anyway normally the blocks
and pumps are sort of only a half that
height if that so it's a very tall unit
but I mean compared to a normal cooler
it's still very small just knocked
everything over compared to the rate
spire for example you can see that the
race Spy is still a much taller cooler
and this is hardly tall by after-market
standards the tower calls and stuff are
a lot taller than that anyway impressive
looking unit and these fans are really
cooler obviously 140 millimeter fans
they're translucent semi-transparent and
they have that's pretty cool it's like a
fan controller switch in the back so if
you don't want to control them off your
motherboard it looks like you can
control the fan speed here not 100% sure
on that I'll have to look it up but it
looks like it's a fan speed controller
and then these these are these basically
the mounting points in each corner
they're really cool you'll see a lot of
fans like the nock to our fans and
that they have the rubber sort of washes
if you will you know around like sort of
like what you see on the top here the
stop vibration and stuff like that but
these entire arms the entire mounts are
made of a really nice rubber soft rubber
and they're bolted to the fan through
those screws there so they'll be
mounting points in there but yeah they
look really cool and you're not going to
get any vibration through those huge
rubber mounts really impressive again
I'll hopefully have thrown up some
b-roll of these so you guys can get a
good look at them a very impressive
looking fans all right
spent enough time on that well we're
looking at fans we month we'll take a
look at these I ordered just four of
these in total them and these are the
master fan pro 120 s seems like that
coolermaster the guys in the marketing
department got a bit lazy in their life
we're just throwing master in front of
whatever the product is and then just
chuck pro on the end that works pretty
well it's a fan so we'll just call it a
master fan pro master liquid pro we just
looked at some master gel no pro on the
end so you can assume there's a better
version of this coming that'll be the
master job Pro and then our yes that
doesn't matter that that's not it yeah
anyway master fan Pro 120s air Balance
RGB in case you didn't get that is the
cooler master master fan Pro 120 air
Balance RGB so a short easy to remember
catchy name there let's see how the fans
are so these are obviously one
120-millimeter fans as it says on the
box and you go there's one box another
box you have another box so
120-millimeter fans they have the same
rubber mount that we saw or similar
rubber mounts that we just throw on the
140 millimeter fans so again they're
really nice and then on the back here
it's interesting this isn't a fan for
your controller we've got a little
switch on the back and it allows you to
set the light in the fan to either red
blue
or RGB mode so again I'll get some
b-roll of that get them all lit up they
should look pretty cool and this is
obviously a fully transparent blade
design and so the LED lights will be no
doubt embedded in the center there
hopefully I spray out like those fins up
and look pretty cool but four of those
from my build I think these are worth
about so just did a quick bit of
research these are $20 u.s. or $25
Australian so that's pretty reasonable
but they don't come with the controller
like we sort of see off the thermaltake
ring plus fans instead these just have
an RGB plug there which you could plug
into existing RGB controllers or the
headers on your soos asrock gigabyte MSI
boards that support their new RGB sort
of stuff so you know like the aural
lighting and all that kind of stuff and
then you've obviously got a four pin fan
header as well so that's pretty cool
obviously if you just want to set them
to a red or blue I believe that will be
powered off just the fan header and if
you have it RGB they might just cycle
some sort of default RGB profile off
just the fan header but I'll check that
at the moment because you're not a
hundred percent sure
anyway cool-looking fan and not stupidly
priced for an RGB fan that seems twenty
dollars us seems pretty reasonable and
then yeah the master gel just got that
because as you guys know I've been doing
so much horizon testing swapping
processes in and out in and out and I
had a whole stack of thermal paste
because you're obviously scrape it all
off clean the cpoe and the our CPU block
the CPU cooler clean everything up or
fully reapply and reinstall and every
time I change a CPU for whatever reason
I do that whole process all over again
to make sure that it's all running as it
should be so you go through a hell of a
lot of thermal paste and baby wipes so I
got thermal take the company on the
thermal paste and so we've got the
master gel low viscosity thermal
compound with easy application so that
should be cool I'll chew through that
pretty quickly I'm off to get some more
of them and they've got some grease
cleanser so
you use to clean up the grease
afterwards so that could be interesting
to check out yeah this is our reasonably
affordable I think it's four dollars us
or six dollars Ozzie so pretty good for
what's supposed to be premium thermal
paste we'll check it out let you guys
know how it goes all right I'll give it
a rest for the cooler massive stuff for
a minute let's have a look at this box
here see what we have okay well we do
have something pretty cool here it is a
graphics card and it is an RX 570 I've
been trying to get my hands on one of
these just checked out the 580 is you
guys know benchmarks the hell out of
that so yeah happy to have a 570 or a
sprang card that's very cool let's check
it out shall we
a very cool Oris badge for those of you
that didn't see it in the last episode
we got this here which I used for that
big rx 518 almost forgot the name Erik's
580 versus GTX 1069 gigabits per second
so use this card for that comparison and
yeah for a mid-range graphics card this
thing was really cool actually ran
really cool it looks really cool and it
is it was a bit pricey for a 5 ad you're
hoping the price comes down a little bit
it was about $280 us and the MSRP is 230
u.s. so yes it EXCI there and here is
its baby brother so it's got more of a
traditional looking windfalls cooler but
it has the Auris logos and things on
leather give it a bit of a touch and
then you've got that really nice or ass
backplate with the cute little copper
insert so that's actually very similar
pretty much the same as what you find
there I think that's the exact same
backplate actually so that's cool take
all this stuff off looks like a pretty
decent cooler looks like we've got four
six millimeter copper heat pipes eight
pin PCI Express power input so that's
cool and then you standard three display
for its HDMI and dual link DVI
very cool plastic fan shroud the same as
this model here just a bit smaller still
got two fans so I believe the gigabyte
rx 570 gaming 4G which is the only other
rx 570 the gigabyte horas branding
offers at the moment so the gigabyte
version is a 180 us or 290 ozzie and
it's pretty much out of stock everywhere
and it's currently available for
pre-order in Australia so technically
out of stock here as well and the Auris
brand card is around 10 to 20 dollars
more expensive in either the US or
Australia so slight premium for this
card does look a bit better it's got a
nicer looking cooler I'm not actually
sure how much better the cooler is I
know you don't get the copper inset on
the backplate on the gigabyte card the
cool looks a little bit lighter or not
quite as beefy but I'm not sure if
that's actually true and this model here
is clocked just 3% higher out of the box
so a slightly higher factory overclock
but nothing to get too excited about
there just overall a better looking card
but whether it's worth the extra 10 or
20 dollars I'm not a hundred percent
sure yet off I'll find out and get back
to you guys anyway in any case a really
cool rx 570 graphics card won't stand on
its end maybe this way you go like and
get some b-roll shots like that okay
before I finish off the cooler massive
stuff we'll have a quick look what's in
here I think I know what this is all
about this box I think I have an idea
for something fun fun little goodies in
here yes
okay so haven't told you guys about this
yet you'll actually find out about it
probably tomorrow where is it hang on
okay so recently tim reviewed the aoc
argon AG 25 1 FZ love monitor names I'm
glad Tim takes care of all that and it
is a 550 WS or $600 astray
to forty Hertz competitive gaming on
insurance a twenty five inch display it
is a TN panel but it's 240 Hertz so you
know there's no way around that
and it's I believe the most affordable
240 Hertz display on the market right
now supports free sync not G stink G
stink G sink so anyway as you know Tim
has reviewed this all you should know
now cuz I just said it Tim's reviewed
this monitor already about a week ago on
my channel found to be quite good value
for what it offers and now I have one
why do I have one well I'm giving one
away
IOC said they would like to do a
giveaway with my channel and Brian from
tech city and we said well give us each
a monitor and we'll give it away so
that's what they've done so once in sent
to Brian this one has been sent to me
and we're going to do a it's going to be
a global giveaway all you guys have to
do is be subscribed hopefully you're
here and you're in the running to win
one that's that simple but yeah we'll
announce the giveaway tomorrow I'd say
on the channels all the details me that
we have a gleam io deal so you just go
there hit the subscribe button and
you're in and yeah so there'll be two of
those given away so that's pretty cool
like I said I liked it a lot more
giveaways on the channel so I'm trying
to organize those I want to do another
full system build soon and give that
away because that was really cool if you
haven't seen who won that I've put the
links to the announcement video by
Thermaltake on the videos for that risin
7 giveaway PC so ago in the US 1 so
that's on the way to him hopefully when
he gets it he takes some photos or
something for us so I can show you guys
but yeah that was pretty cool anyway for
this giveaway they have included a few
extras so you've got a smart a OC polo
shirt which you can wear when you're
gaming no doubt we've got an AOC bag
which you can throw things in we have
some IOC pens so there you go some pens
yep there right so that's cool three of
them and we have a mind you these are
the ones that are going to the
contestants I'm not throwing around the
prizes there will be a separate package
from AOC sent out so this is actually
all for me to keep to show you guys and
they're paying to send out the global
ones so yeah it's not me throwing around
the prizes from who I was going to win
we also have a really cool gigabyte XM
300 Mouse so hopefully that can keep up
with your 240 Hertz display be a really
cool gaming mouse it's got a polling
rate of a thousand Hertz oh there you go
four-stage DPI switch charts got Omron
switches you can do on-the-fly dpi
switching it's RGB of course that can be
controlled in the extreme engine
software so a very smart Mouse there
6400 dpi so that'll be more than you
need I'd say even with this monitor a
couple of pens and a cool little Edition
that they're throwing is this overwatch
pop figurine that's pretty cool I really
like that we don't makeup so it looks
like there's at least six in the
overwatch set so you can get Winston
soldier 76 and creeper and a few others
tracer so that's really cool have a bit
of a look at that actually so there you
go if you win the monitor you can sit
that under there doesn't want to stand
up on the monitor box so it's down my
desk okay bad news guys the figurine
doesn't stand up at all now we get here
we go did it a little bit of bending
required possibly want to blue tack that
down
overwatch pop figurine very cool
just spoke to my IOC contact they said
they would double my fee if I try on the
polo shirt so here we are just kidding I
didn't happen okay you might have to
clear off actually we look at the power
supply than the last two items that's a
wrap
anyway I've actually said this is the
cooler master v6 50 power supply so is
their premium gold rated power supply it
says new upgrade in the corner
must be a new upgraded version I don't
know but it has 100% Japanese capacitors
a five-year warranty a Silencio fan and
a gold eighty plus rated certification
so we've got the rubber up black
rubberized cables which look fine
they're quite neat and tidy they're not
obviously not sleeved but yes because
the price you pay for this unit
they're very good cables so the power
supplies $85 us which is really cheap
for a quality 650 watt unit or 120
Aussie which is again very cheap in
Australia and I think I love about these
units is they're really really smart
looking I love this sort of embedded
aluminium or brushed aluminium sort of
grey fire light there and the fan a
honeycomb fan shroud that also looks
really good with that one hundred and
twenty millimeter fans a very compact
unit as well 650 watts all that doesn't
sound like a lot it's actually a hell
what a power you can run these days you
can run a lot like you'd run Verizon 7
1800 X overclocks to 44.1 gigahertz no
worries with a Titan X P if you want gtx
980ti or no doubt the upcoming Vega GPUs
they'll run off there's no problem
everything overclocked you have a heap
of fans liquid cooling pump the whole
lot so 650 watts on a gold rated power
supply is a heap of power and there's
very very few users or systems that
would require any more than that so as
you can see fully modular power supply
mother
characters there and there we have four
connectors for basically your 4-pin
molex connectors and your SATA power
connectors so they're five four rather
foot five pin headers then we have four
eight pin PCI Express power connectors
for GPUs and whatever else might use
them and then yeah that's the other
motherboard connector there so fully
modular these things connect in there
you've got a power cord and then the
motherboard cables are there that's very
cool
some details so you have what is it a 54
amp 12 volt rail providing 648 watts so
you're going to better hang up quite a
few GPUs off that and yeah so then you
have kind of like a nice design on the
side better show off same on the other
side that will obviously be the rear
side so you've got your power switch it
auto switches between 110 volts to 220
volts so that's good good you can't blow
it up yes smart little unit so that will
be going in my rising v 1600 X build
with all the rest of the cooler master
gear okay so as I said before tim has
reviewed this you guys have seen all
Tim's glorious b-roll of it but I'll
take our other package and we'll see
what it looks like when you get it so we
can experience what the winner will feel
like when they get theirs so looks like
we've got a USB 3 cable there for a hub
power brick manual with a few audio
cables a remote for senior citizens as
Tim put it 3 pin power cable wall mount
kit display cable
just drop that on my foot could have
been worse
got to drop that on my foot there you go
25 inch 240 Hertz monitor looks very
cool on the back let's put it together
so you're not much I can really say that
Tim hasn't already in his review but I
will be featuring this in a few upcoming
videos shot here in the studio playing
some games and stuff I actually really
want to test out 240 Hertz gaming for
myself because I haven't done that yet
I've obviously done a fair bit of 144
Hertz but I want to see what the
difference is like in games like
overwatch going to 240 Hertz so it
should be pretty interesting
through our gtx 1080i in there and see
how I go that would be cool to take
advantage of the free sync so I like to
try crossfire RX 5 80s or something like
that and see what the difference is like
there but anyway that's something to
play with very soon now last but
certainly not least is that cooler
master master case Noah Pro in there
make a 5 T so we'll check that out now
again that will be being featured or
will be featured in the bills shortly on
the channel that will unbox the case and
have a look
that can you still see me set that
better maybe there I get the feeling
this is a reasonably large case I'll be
back in a moment
bull crap alright here we go
what about breaking you know your case
is a bit extreme when it comes with a
bit of polystyrene foam like that now
that was a shame to throw that out but
we will so along with the case and the
top you get this nice little tin here
very impressive looking tin Wow
it's like a little toolbox jeez okay
that's impressive cable ties a thing
more things probably their table
management things more things what's
nuts alright didn't scratch it we're
fine and another thing so many things
here well it's even got a foam cushion
on that foam cushion on the bottom
that's just that's a premium tin right
there suppose when you're paying 210
dollars u.s. or almost $300 stray lien
for a case probably warrants a fancy
in all right actually before I lose all
this stuff I'll put it back in the team
all right let's have a look at this
beast it's got so many things every time
I grab it I pull something off so this
has tempered glass panels they look like
they're about four mil thick on the
front and back or left and right side
anyway
door panels are tempered glass as you
can see here and they both have as
nothing on the back or anything like
that to remove them so it looks like
once you turn the key it just pops off
let's find out you guys have one of
these or I've seen one I'll probably
watch the review will be likely to Steve
it's so easy to get the door off but I
do not want to read the manual okay
the trick is just to pull it genius all
right the struggle was real all right
one glass panel removed well some
graphics card holders they look pretty
impressive so we have a lot of stuff in
here we have a giant bag of do not eat
probably one of the biggest bags I've
ever seen that red internal paint work
looks phenomenal I kind of wanted to do
a black and orange build because the
rise in boxes well they're gray and
orange but I thought black and orange
would be pretty cool since that sort of
are in just the rising color more so
than the AMD rec hmm so I might respray
that stuff orange but it looks so gloom
red as well and I told me in the
comments should I take all the red stuff
out of the case for the build and spray
paint Orange and settle these fans in
bill to orange or should I just stick
with the red hmm the lazy and possibly
still awesome looking option would be to
leave it all red I kind of want to see a
black orange bill because black red
bills have sort of been done to death
okay so that's a really that's a really
cool Schumer's LED light strip nice
magnetic base that moves around really
easily looks very cool you could put
that up the top I suppose or pretty much
anywhere where there's a metal surface
so you can see through the huge cutout
the motherboard here we got the glass
panel behind that so the case comes with
a pair of what looked like a hundred and
forty millimeter fans installed in the
front and one in the back loved the
rubberized handle on top that's cool
if you guys have seen it from the front
so that's the front of the case and then
this comes away this has got really nice
sound deadening throwing in the front of
it to help stop any noise from the fans
escaping then we've got a nice sort of
more traditional looking front grille
trying to drop this thing off the desk
so it was kind of a cool amounts to show
you this time but it was good to unbox
all this stuff and I'm very keen to make
that Verizon v system which could end up
being a bit custom if I decided to paint
it and do all that sort of stuff we'll
we'll see what happens there
yeah funny of cool stuff we've got fans
cooler graphics cards Mouse monitor pop
figure that won't stand up what else
power supply really cool tin I love that
tin
that'll be repurposed for something yeah
good fun unboxing no 1080 T eyes or
anything crazy like that but a nice
spread of different hardware even though
a lot of it was Coolermaster so I hope
you guys enjoyed and stay tuned because
like I said tomorrow we have that AOC
giveaway then I think there's a cool
review from Tim coming up then I'll be
comparing the risin 5 1400 to the rise
and 5 1600 in applications and games
because when I did that 1400 versus 1500
X video it became apparent that would be
cool to compare them clock for clock and
out of the box to the 6 core rise and 5
1600 as well so I will be doing that
1400 versus 1600 and in the week after I
might follow up by adding the 1700 as
well so you'll get a 14 16 and 17 all
tested out of the box and clock for
clock in games and application so those
should be pretty cool I'm still working
on that is the Radeon r9 390 still worth
buying I'm testing a HEPA games for that
but I'm more than halfway now so that
should be in the next week or so and I'm
also going to start another segment
where I look back at older graphics
cards and see how they play games today
both demanding ones and not so demanding
games or demanding ones especially
pretty cool as well I think that covers
everything so that's it for this episode
of unboxing boxes I'm your host Steve
I'll see you again soon guys
