to be joined by my trusty sidekick Tim
for Marches Q&amp;amp;A and apologies for
missing the Q&amp;amp;A last month but we will
be making up for it this month by
answering a heap of your questions and a
big thank you to everyone who did ask
question alright let's jump into it okay
so our first question comes from YouTube
one of the more uploaded ones would it
be dumb for Nvidia 10 series owners who
bought their GPU before the crypto craze
to sell their GPUs at a profit and wait
for price normalization in order to get
a better card for discounts okay I'll
take that one ya reckon well the good
news is I think that ship has pretty
well sailed now or at least it's
starting to leave the port which is
great news for gamers the gtx 1080 for
example that can now be found for under
$700 u.s. and that's still about $200
above the MSRP so I can't believe I'm
saying yeah it's still a better price
than it was I think they were up over
900 not that long ago so we're probably
going to continue to see prices tumble
over the next month next few months
don't hold me to that but you'll
probably have a hard time selling your
graphics card now for a profit
that'll warrant doing without a graphics
card for a while till you can buy
another one yeah but you could still
stand to make $100 or so if you had a
higher-end one which again probably not
worth it okay this next question comes
again from YouTube where are the H 370
and B 360 motherboards and that is a
pretty good question we address this in
a bit more detail on the patreon
livestream but basically pretty shocked
these aren't out yet already I know it's
been a huge delay we've got coffee-like
CPUs late last year and still said 370
only boards but I can tell you that we
have signed an NDA so I can't say much
more than that but that should probably
tell you all you need to know they're
pretty close so the next question is
also from YouTube when is in video
releasing their new
generation of GPUs so we really don't
have an idea about this one the current
room is sounding like q3 or q4 of this
year so maybe Computex type timeframe to
hear more details yeah really we don't
know we haven't signed an NDA so it's
just just guessing really at this stage
but hopefully the second half of the
year yep that's what I'd be thinking as
well next question comes from Twitter do
you think that rise and second-gen will
be worth it or a person should just buy
first gen will it be a big improvement
over first gen or will the difference be
what's a lot we saw between sky and KB
like skylight KB like I'll let you
answer that one yeah so I guess if you
haven't bought into the rise in the
ecosystem yet definitely just wait until
second gen comes out at this point you
know once that comes out there really
will be no reason to buy the first gen
parts I mean unless you can get one
really cheap on a sale yeah
there is no IPC difference between
skylake and KB like so the difference
will hopefully be bigger than that I'm
sorry we're not too sure but we should
be getting some clock speed improvements
as well that will bring you know it's
not an entirely new process no at 12
nanometer so even if there's very little
IPC difference hopefully we'll be able
to push those clock speeds up higher if
not yeah I guess you'll be taking the
rest of the year off what we watch
content to make yeah yep I'll probably
pack up my bags and I'll see you guys
next year
all right this questions from YouTube
you test sort of games which ones do
keep playing after testing what's this
GG PC says you can play games after
testing you never told me about this all
right so this question is from dude on
YouTube
hey Hardware own box I've got a question
for you during the production of GPU
dies they're supposedly bin them what
happens to the GPUs that don't make the
cut for instance a gtx 1070 GPU dies
produced but fails short of the 1070
spec but is still better than a 1060 as
I understand normally they would do a
1060 TI but since this model doesn't
exist
what happens to it thanks Alex from the
USA okay well you've nailed part of that
question already oh well worked it out
that said though there really shouldn't
be that many defective ten seventies as
ten 70s are ten 80s that didn't make the
cut of course so they're made on a
different bit of silicon or there are
different GPU to the ten sixty the ten
sixty is based on the GP 106 die and
that means defective six gigabyte ten
60s are Bend as three gigabyte models as
they have a few less cuticles but to
answer your question usually even if
they start seeing really good yields but
just keep things as they are now they
only introduce something like a GTX 1072
I Affairs a hole that needs filling and
that is to compete with an AMD product
gtx 1062 i was probably never going to
happen though unless the GP 104 yields
were really really bad or if AMD
released a vega 48 GPU as a hypothetical
example okay this next question is from
youtube and the question is looking to
upgrade to Rison - should I keep my X
370 or buy an X 470 motherboard yes I
reckon you should probably keep your X
370 board for now since X 470 boards on
out yet and you know MB hasn't specified
what they're actually going to bring to
people buying rise into or even on first
generation rising so yeah we kind of
speculated a bit on our patreon
livestream that you know maybe they
might do things like improve memory
compatibility yeah there might be you
know additional ports and stuff they
could put through the chipset but
where's your speculate we have no idea
so basically just keep it for now it's a
wait-and-see thing yeah alright this is
a great question from YouTube I'd love
to see a PCIe riser comparison video
from the cheap eBay ones to the premium
category for ecchymosis
yeah riser cables bit of a tricky one I
could have done that type of video and I
did touch on unboxing boxes episode
because I had some thermaltake ones a
few different revisions
yeah yeah they are all giving me
headaches basically avoid cheap cables
that cheap riser cables they're all
garbage you really have to spend quite a
bit of money to get a good shielded one
in my experience anyway about they're
quite expensive for good ones especially
in Australia like you're looking at at
least $80 Australian for a decent razor
cable in my experience anything under
that you'll usually see things like
latency issues and that's not just in
gaming either like watching a YouTube
video there'll be weird lag and problems
like that and can even upset the entire
experience so I'd recommend buying from
a brand name a known brand and cables
that companies like Coursera and that
recommend I know Thermaltake do have a
new cable now that's supposed to solve
those issues I haven't seen it but I
would avoid buying any cheap cables off
eBay they guaranteed to be trash so this
is from Twitter and I'm personally very
interested the answer to this one Steve
how did the pizzas turn out
ah the pizzas well they were amazingly
good so good that I didn't have time to
get a picture so I'll try next time go
make one for me yeah well maybe we'll
see how long this stream takes me I have
to stop and have some dinner or
something so question from YouTube here
how hard is it to keep the lights on and
not go bust have you ever been close to
running out of money love the videos and
keep them coming so thanks to that and
I'm sure you'll be able to well I've
read on this we've been close to making
money the good thing about YouTube at
least for our channel and the way we
operate because most of or a lot of the
hardware's provided we do spend a lot of
money still but really the overhead for
the channel is very low so Tim and I
really only get paid as much as we make
and we don't demand any more or we can't
it's pretty unrealistic too but that's
really the only way we've been able to
make this channel happen so I think for
the first two years the first year and a
half I do it with Matt that was just we
did it for fun that was definitely very
little paying going on there but yeah
Tim and I both do other things to pay
the bills but the channel starting to
make more and more money which is good
it's nice getting a bit of money for it
but yeah so
basically to answer the question though
no risk of you know running it or having
to close down the channel because of
money it's just it's there's no
overheads and we just do it solely
because we love playing around the
computer gear and making videos about it
yeah I think you said you know we do
other stuff as well to pay the bills but
it's not like we have a second job or
anything no all of this is related it's
related it ties in with this so yeah we
both freelance write for tech spot that
helps pay a few bills and whatnot
yeah the other thing is that you know we
have a lot of opportunity as well to
sort of expand our revenue streams in
that so thing you see in a few in-stream
ads and you know videos they helped a
lot of lately so you know we want to
continue to include those and you know
Yes Doctor
you know continue to make our videos
better and that sort of thing so yeah
it's all going pretty well what's that
in a moment
yeah we're both happy with it so if it
continues going the way it is we won't
have to worry about that too much so
that is definitely a good thing so this
one's from Twitter interested about
answer this one too what is the oldest
part you have in the studio here
actually that's that's very easy for me
to answer I'm pretty certain a few
people have pointed this out and laughed
about it I'm pretty sure it's this guy
right here seen this before noticed this
on the show I made before I was born
actually you know I wouldn't have been
this is for those of you that haven't
recognized it it is my well it is a
seller on 308 it's my one and this was
released in late 1998 ago I was born
yeah I thought so yeah for those of you
that want to know a bit more about this
it was a hundred and $49 us sell to sell
Iran for a hundred and forty one dollars
u.s. that was the MSRP and it was a
single core CPU that ran at 300
megahertz and I had a 128 kilobytes
level two cache and you like similar to
your laptops a 17.8 TDP so that's pretty
pretty cool yeah a bit of a beast there
overclocked to this particular chip
to somewhere between 450 and 500
megahertz and that's why this was a bit
special because it overclocked like a
champion so from that's a that's a big
overclock on a 300 megahertz part and I
did that on it was an eye open
motherboard so you had you know I open
never heard of it
all the kids in the audience liked what
I opened dad did you know about a bit No
Wow well I don't know if I feel old or
you just before my time I think put this
back so this question is from our
discord chat that you can get through
our patreon page and this is a fantastic
question I reckon from Revell devil mm
what is the one thing in the computer
world whether it be laptops or desktops
that you guys think needs the most
improvement on random examples SSD
speeds integrated graphics motherboard
layouts and etc hmm I'll let you go
first on this one Steve it's a tough one
we need like an intermission thing give
me 10 minutes
you know SSDs not really there fast
enough yeah you can go from like a sada
to an nvme that's like three times the
bandwidth and it's you're not really
gonna notice it unless you're doing
crazy Enterprise type stuff or data
center type work hmm motherboard layouts
yeah they could be improved a bit but
it's not big deal not really a big deal
they've tried different formats and yeah
it hasn't really taken off you know what
annoys me the most I think with the
computing experience these days it's
probably windows I thought that
Microsoft I don't want to bash on the
windows I like the Windows operating
system for the most part but just they
do some dumb things with it and some of
the updates take away features they
didn't need to and they just rearranged
things and messed things up a bit so
yeah Windows probably annoys me the most
and also games what what is up with
games the quality of games like we want
better hardware support take better
advantage of the PC hardware for a start
and then I suppose just better quality
games and ones that aren't broken as
soon as they're released yeah thousands
of bugs well yeah yeah essentially that
that would be good so I have complained
about software and software haven't I
yeah was it a hardware specific question
or there's a few Hardware things I can
definitely think I'll pass it over to
Tim then go for it
like battery life yeah every device you
have that has a battery in it does not
last long enough yes
so I really hope we things like phones
and laptops you'll be able to use a
faction more than a day for once at some
point in the future before I die
maybe yeah that's one integrated
graphics as well for like laptops and
stuff is unless you're getting Rison
which is like three laptops on the
market pretty much I'm stuck with the
Intel net integrated graphics is
terrible so yeah improvements there
would be nice but yeah I agree with you
on the windows and software stuff as
well like there's a lot of very odd
decisions like yes I mean I don't want
to bash it too much by yeah there's
better than running Mac's duel well I
wasn't gonna go there that was a more
goes about saying type of yeah I think
so see you've detected this Q&amp;amp;A yeah all
right well I think we've hopefully I
didn't really answer that one that well
because I don't think it was a hardware
specific one yeah so yeah anyway this
next question comes from YouTube do you
think the CTS lab stuff will have a
lasting effect seems to me that people
are forgetting about it already
who's czs labs next okay this next
question it comes from YouTube why
aren't 60 Hertz monitors this will be
one for you shipped at 100 or 120 Hertz
why the companies make us go into the
monitor settings and overclock it again
yeah so there's kind of two separate
parts to this question I guess there are
monitors that our advertisers
overclockable like the ASA Pro X 34 that
I use that comes out of the box at 60
Hertz and then you can overclock up to
100 Hertz using the Mars on screen
settings
and basically having that modeler as
overclockable rather than just always a
hundred Hertz allows them to sell
monitors that don't quite reach 100
Hertz so it's kind of like instead of
having to throw away the ones that only
reach you know 90 or 95 Hertz they can
sell those yeah because you can
overclock adjust up to whatever limits
you can get so you get better yields and
then of course is the other monitors
that aren't officially overclockable at
all so they're like 60 Hertz and you can
maybe you know in some driver settings
whatever push that up backing yeah a bit
of 100 Hertz or 120 X sometimes and
that's just like overclocking any you
know sort of component really you know
some monitors will be able to overclock
some won't at all so for those monitors
they don't make them overclockable they
don't sell them at a hundred Hertz and
it's just you know like I guess that you
get one they can do it this question is
from YouTube as well do you have any
idea about the prices of the upcoming
risin 2600 and X 470 motherboards well
again we talked about this in quite a
bit of detail on the alive patreon
stream but basically short answer no
apart from the leaked info that's out
there and we don't really have much more
to go on and we usually like to wait
until we have official information to
give you guys so what's leave it at that
so from Twitter risin 312 hundred in
2018 is it a good choice yeah okay well
it's not bad but it's probably not a
great choice since the 2200 G that's the
rise in 320 200 G is at least well it's
meant to be $10 cheaper at MSRP so it
should be at worst case the same price
and it should have better resale value
because it has that Vega rate GPU inside
so yeah I'd go for the 2200 year I think
okay so this one's from Twitter got a
lot of questions that were similar to
this how can I build a PC with the right
price and youtubers like you and tech
deals or any other tech channel who
might have GPUs in stock to sell to the
viewers if requests okay well down to
the first part of that question probably
your only option at the moment
a shop secondhand or we just wait for
prices to come down because they will
sadly though youtubers aren't really in
a position to sell to their viewers
because I could basically make one of
you happy and the rest of you would be
not happy if I did that though I'd have
nothing to make content with tomorrow
I have over 100 graphics cards not all
of them I knew they're quite old some of
them but almost none of them are the
same so they're all different GPUs for
doing my benchmarks and stuff so
basically if I sold you my GTX 1084 the
MSRP I no longer have a GTX 1082
benchmark with and yeah that's kind of a
problem for me in the channel if I can't
show you guys GTX tennety performance
anymore because I sold mine so that
answers that question next question is
from Twitter there are some rumors
saying that graphics card pricing will
go back to something reasonable sometime
soon as there anything to back that up
yes yeah crypto currency crashing a
little bit more than usual at the moment
so that's suggesting that there you know
might be a downward trend in a graphics
card pricing seems there's been a lot of
you know government stuff that spooked
there okay crypto investors which is
great for people because I just want to
buy GPUs memory prices is still very
high that's an entire unrelated problem
to the crypto stuff so I wouldn't expect
that to hit the MSRP anytime soon but
hopefully in the GPU stuff should start
to get back to normal a little bit lot
less ridiculous you reckon yes
alright well everyone hold Tim to that
you're predicting two weeks two weeks ok
this next question is from YouTube and
this will be for you again Tim do you
think that 1440p 144 Hertz and ultra
wires should be the new standard yeah so
not sure 1440p 144 Hertz should be the
Stan I guess because they're pretty
expensive still at the moment probably
one of the most expensive motor
categories out there I think the
standard I guess is kind of something
that should be affordable for everyone
that's why it's early pieces yeah so I
think 1080p 144 Hertz like high refresh
1080p
be really good if they can get them
super cheap so that they're the sort of
default 1080p panels that would be
awesome
1440p 144 Hertz being a stands probably
a fair way away yeah
as for ultra wide I think that's more of
a preference thing you know some people
prefer 16:9 some people prefer the ultra
wide sort of experience so not really
something that should be a standard just
something that you know coexists with
I'm not your wide fan yeah I love ultra
wide spy obviously not everyone yeah
he's in personal preference so yeah
that's a preference thing cool should I
buy a GT 1032 avoid high prices during
the mining craze a GT ten okay yeah
probably not I actually have a good
video that's coming out tomorrow that
sort of addresses this but you can get
graphics cards such as a gtx 660ti for
much less than a GT 1030 and in that
particular example you'll look to get it
or you stand to get about 70 percent
more performance and that is in modern
titles so that's what I would do go get
myself a secondhand graphics card next
questions from YouTube do you think the
new mainstream cards from Nvidia will be
a Pascal refresh probably yeah yeah
probably
alright quick question here from YouTube
used 980ti
or 1070 okay well as with any sort of
second-hand purchase really depends on
the price that you can get the 980ti for
for second-hand parts I really like to
get at least a 40% discount on whatever
it is you're paying for a new gtx 1070
so again depending on the price if you
can get it for at least 40% less than
the new part then that's the deal I
would go for all right guys we're gonna
stop this video here we've answered
quite a few questions
wherever heat more that we would like to
address so we're going to do a part two
of the March QA so thanks for watching
so far we'll see you again soon you got
nothing on that 100k who say that oh yes
oh you read the whole thing yeah yeah
[Laughter]
yeah
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
