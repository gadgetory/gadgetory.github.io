video this time we're checking our
crossfire performance to see how two of
these $240 GPUs compare within videos
higher-end GPUs such as the 980 TI 1070
and just the halibut the much more
expensive GT X 1080 if you haven't
already checked out my rx 480 overview
video benchmark video and overclocking
video be sure to check those out as well
in short the strongest attribute of the
our X 480 has been as cost per dollar
ratio which sees a just managed to our
class the $260 discounted GTX 970
graphics cards getting around at the
moment AMD have been working hard to
improve crossfire scaling and frame
pacing for some time now so I thought
why not serve up the 23 games I tested
in the main benchmark video to see how
the our X 480 duo gets on of the 23
games we test with the our X 480
crossfire cards are broken in just six
of them those games included Just Cause
3 Rainbow six seed Batman Arkham Knight
anno 2205
doom and surprisingly hitman of course
most of these games don't support our
celaya though so we're happy to give AMD
a pass for these titles unfortunately I
haven't had time to gather the frame
time results or all of the graphics
cards tested so I'll only be providing
that information the Radian our X 480
crossfire to be compared with a single
our X 480 I'll talk about the results
for a few of the more interesting titles
in the benchmarks section next but
you'll be able to find the full results
for all games tested at our website
hardware and voxcom
I'll also be commenting on how the game
is played with crossfire enabled in the
conclusion for a full list of the test
system specs please check the video
description we'll also find a detailed
video index the results in The Witcher 3
were interesting for a few reasons first
of all the average framerate produced by
the crossfire cars was massive it even
eclipsed the 1080 the problem is the
massive discrepancy in frame pacing as
you can see the 1% frame time in
crossfire mode was 20 frames below the
minimum which made for a very jittery
playing experience it was very annoying
to play with Far Cry primal was another
game where the crossfire for 80s perform
really well with 88% scaling this
allowed the average to again just beat
out the GTX 1080 and this time the frame
pacing was a lot more consistent here
the 1% frame time was we
eight frames of the minimum meaning the
minimum was just 15% higher this made
for a smooth planning experience
compared to the 1070 the para for 80s
was 30% faster here to rise of the Tomb
Raider was a title where the four
eighties didn't perform overly well here
the performance scaled only 52 percent
meaning the 1070 was within 1 percent
and they were 24% slower than the GTX
1080 thankfully though gameplay was
smooth as the 1 percent frame time was
within 7 percent of the minimum frame
rate GTA 5 was another game where
performance was both impressive and
smooth the team of our X 4 80s scaled by
fantastic 87% meaning it was just 17
percent faster than the single 1070 and
9 percent behind the much more expensive
1080 frame rates were smooth as a
milkshake here too with frame times
within 4% of the minimum fallout 4 was a
bit of a letdown in terms of crossfire
performance despite 71 percent scaling
gameplay was very jittery so the 12
percent advantage over the 1070 didn't
mean much hopefully this can be improved
for the fallout 4 fans soon the last
game I'll discuss here is ARMA 3 where
crossfire scoured to the tune of 92%
extremely impressive stuff though was
only 5% faster than the 1070 and 13%
slower than the 1080 thankfully gameplay
was really smooth here - so AMD and ARMA
fans will be wrapped on average we saw a
total system power consumption of 437
watts when gaming this was up from the
235 watts of the single card and 240
watts of the gtx 1070 a lot of gamers
couldn't give to stuffs about how much
power the rig uses when gaming but I
think it's an important factor to
consider that the cars will use 85
percent more power than the 1070 system
honestly I've never been much of a fan
of multi GPU technology SLI or crossfire
when I spend hundreds of dollars on a
product or products I kind of wanted to
just work and in the past this
technology has never been extremely well
polished this is still kind of the case
as there were those six games that I
mentioned where multi-gpu Tech is simply
broken however I was impress that out of
my 23 game gauntlet 17 of them did work
and most of them works really well with
the 17 games there were nine West
scaling was over 75% which is a great
result
I also found 13 of them really smooth to
play with the exceptions being the
witcher 3 black ops 3 star wars
battlefront and fallout 4 the other good
news is that the single card rx4 ad
provided extremely smooth
for months with the 1% frame time
falling within 5% of the minimum frame
rate on average this variance did
increase to 20% with crossfire enabled
but this includes the games that I found
quite jittery now a lot of you will be
interested in how these cards fared
against the gtx 1070 in particular with
2 Rx for ATS performance was an average
14% faster than a single card results
with the 1070 where it was 35% slower
without its twin out of interest if you
take away the games where performance
was jittery this average didn't change
so I suppose for around the same money
you can get slightly better performance
from this pair of AMD cards however keep
in mind there are some major titles
where you'll be stuck with single card
performance and some others where the
gameplay is far from smooth
I said I'd compare with the 1082 where
one on one the RX 480 was 47% slower
turning the contest to American doubles
with crossfire the 4 80s were now on
average just 9% slower this performance
boost will come with all of the same
caveats previously mentioned though of
course still an impressive result given
the RX for 80 cards cost us 480 dollars
while the GTX 1080 will set you back in
excess of 600 so honestly crossfire
performance was a lot more impressive
and reliable than unexpected though I'd
still like to see some more improvements
made some of these titles mentioned
where Crossfire's flat-out broken or
jittery are very popular games and if it
came down to choosing between the
slightly faster overall duel four 80s or
the reliable and consistent 1070 that
aren't honestly be leaning towards the
fastest single GPU option as I always
have I just like to be able to know that
my expensive hardware is going to work
well with virtually every game what do
you guys think of the 480 crossfire
results are they better than you
