couple of days ago you probably saw my
video looking into freesync on nvidia
gpus after Nvidia open up support in
their latest drivers there was lots of
good feedback to that video which is
always nice but there were a couple of
questions and comments that I thought
worth addressing in a separate video so
here I haven't responded to a small
selection of comments and I guess well
let's get straight into it so the first
comment we have here is from mobius 2k
and they said so flickering and other
issues would just vies great I think
this was one of the top uploaded
comments and it is definitely worth
discussing the flickering and other
issues were wise in the sense that
Nvidia portrayed these problems as major
issues with the free sync monitor
ecosystem when actually it's only a very
small number of monitors that have these
problems I don't think they explicitly
said this but it was definitely
presented in a way that suggested the
problems were inherent to the adaptive
sync ecosystem hence the need for
invidious magic god-tier g-sync
implementation and hence the need for
decent compatible certification and
that's what I didn't like because there
are plenty free sync monitors that work
fine and adjust as grooves jisuk
monitors really but it's also important
to note that there are some monitors out
there that genuinely do have flickering
and blanking issues with adaptive sync
and able there aren't many monitors but
some early models in particular did have
issues I don't think these crappy
defective products are indicative of the
overall free sync ecosystem and
certainly anyone that has a monitor that
experiences these issues should return
it as defective it's also kind of funny
to me because there are some g-sync
monitors that have flickering issues in
some circumstances the Acer predator X
34 for example is technically a 60 Hertz
monitor that can be overclocked to 100
Hertz and there were some reports around
launch that some models exhibited
flickering when overclocked to 100 Hertz
again this was a problem with some
models of that monitor it had really
nothing to do with J sync so another
comment here of course it would only
work with Pascal cheering since they are
the only ones they sell luckily for the
surplus of Pascal stock otherwise I'm
sure they would advertise this as a
cheering feature
yeah wouldn't surprise me if in video
we're restricting freesync to pass
countering for marketing reasons but the
real reason is that Pascal cards were
the first to support DisplayPort 1.2 a
Maxwell also technically supports
adaptive sync without a g-sync module
and does so in laptops but desktop
maxwell cards don't have DisplayPort 1.2
a which is a requirement for adaptive
sync hence why Pascal and up are the
only cards that officially support it so
Peter here has asked this question
Tim did you consider that free sync
monitors could get more expensive
because in video might charge a license
fee for each sold free sync monitor
which Nvidia approves it wouldn't be the
first time that Nvidia does a scam like
this they did so for SLI they made every
motherboard company pay a license fee
for sli per sold motherboard which the
customer who bought the motherboard had
to pay so it might be bad for AMD
customers that Nvidia now allows
freezing to be used depending on whether
or not nvidia charges for a license
again yeah this is something I've seen
discussed a fair bit and I think it's
hard to say for certain what will happen
so so far I haven't spotted any price
increases for the 12 Jason compatible
models but I doubt there would be an
increase to the price anyway because
most stock would have been already sold
to retails at the old price so I guess
the question is primarily where the new
free sync monitors will cost more so I
sort of look at this from two angles the
first one is that a monitor doesn't need
to be Jason compatible to work with
NVIDIA GPUs with this comments
motherboard example a manufacturer did
have to pay nvidia to enable SLI support
so they either pay to have that feature
or they don't pay and the feature isn't
supported but with the monitors adaptive
sync will support NVIDIA GPUs or now
work with NVIDIA GPUs whether the OEM
pays for juicing compatible
certification or not so there's not as
much I guess of an incentive to pay so
I'd expect that companies introduced I
guess in producing budget or value
products will not bother with the Jason
compatible branding and just continue to
offer those products with no price
increases the other angle is marketing
some companies may wish to include
g-sync compatible browsing so they can
market their monitor as being Jason
compatible I expect there would be a fee
involved but I can't imagine the fee
would be high
enough to change pricing significantly
after all if the fee was high enough
that either the OEMs margins were
reduced by a decent amount or the
pricing becomes uncompetitive I doubt
the OEM with would bother with the
sticker especially because as I just
mentioned it's not necessary tips get
decent compatible certification to make
the monitor work with NVIDIA GPUs it's
also not unusual for monitor OMS to pay
for certain stickers and branding on
their boxes I'm not 100% sure but I
believe if OMS want to use either free
sync or the phaser display HDR branding
there are small associated fees with
that and I'd be surprised of juice
incompatible was any different it'll be
interesting to see how this plays out
though but my expectation is that
monitor pricing will be largely
unaffected even if there is a license
fee associated with the gcn comparable
branding so expect that license fee
would be certainly much much smaller
than the cost of buying the modules that
we've seen across you know the fully
fledged g-sync monitors Richard O'Shea
has said
makes you wonder where the pressure to
support free sync came from I guess it
came from the market so much for walled
gardens um yeah I think I think the
writing has been on the wall for some
time now the free sync monitor ecosystem
is far larger than Jason can has grown a
huge rate so I think it's just got to
the point where Nvidia restricting
buyers to just g-sync monitors was
working against them previously there
were benefits I guess to keeping Nvidia
owners locked into the war garden but
it's now gone to the point where NVIDIA
GPU owners were stuck with just maybe
10% of the adaptive sink market while
AMD GPU owners could access the other
90% in the budget market I think this
hurts a fair bit you could pare say at
$200 RX 580 was the 200 or freesync
monitor and get a good experience but in
video owners will be left spending 100
to 200 dollars more to get the same
adaptive sync experience and that's a
lot of money for a budget gamer so
locking it down I don't think was a
sustainable approach then there as well
was the threat of Intel GPUs around the
corner until a supporting freesync
starting with Gen 11 integrated graphics
and presumably their discreet GPS will
support it as well so in just a few
years in video would be battling both
AMD and Intel in the adaptive sync
market and that's not a winning strategy
so really they had no choice but to
enable free sync support so you had one
commenter here
like to the fact that only Windows 10 is
supported with the NVIDIA freesync they
are no support for iOS is including
early versions of Windows and yep I've
seen this is the case I don't think
there would be any technical reason why
freesync wouldn't work on old operating
systems so I guess it's a bit
disappointing that's locked down but at
the same time a lot of other gaming
features are also restricted to Windows
10 like DirectX 12 so really if you're a
gamer you probably should be running
Windows 10 anyway we had another
question here from Allan does DP to HDMI
adapter work pretty simple answer to
this one no it doesn't work I tested it
and many other have as well and confirm
that this isn't possible so
unfortunately all those through sink
HDMI motors simply don't work even with
an adapter one comment here says I have
had an AOC 1440p 165 Hertz g-sync
monitor for about eight months and it
has started blanking lately not sure
what to do about it
um yeah as I've mentioned a few times
any blanking issues directly related to
the monitor itself not free sink
adaptive sink or G sink so if it's
looking like your IFC model has become
defective I'd recommend aromanian and
luckily because it happened within eight
months it should still be under warranty
so assent here host 'add a long comment
i'm only gonna take one excerpt of it
and respond to it so I'll just read it
out here you seem to think free sync and
gsync vrrr equals that one is as good as
the other while theoretically Trudeau's
not sure in practice the VR our range
for free sync monitors is all over the
place sometimes the free sync VR our
range is so small it's almost useless
g-sync Auto op is the exact same and
very wide v RR range there's also the
matter of input lag where real g-sync
monitors are consistently the fastest
free synchronous can be anywhere from
great to terrible this must always be
front and center when discussing free
sync chasing in abstract unless the
customer is willing to look through very
detailed reviews which measure V are
arranged and input lag which don't exist
for every monitor you can't say both VR
our technologies are equivalent in
practice g-sync is often better and
never worse unfortunately so yeah this
is something that has come up in a
number of comments and a number of
articles discussions all that sort of
thing
but in my opinion when discussing
precinct were suggesting I think it's
important to split up the technology
with talk of the validation and branding
in terms of the technology there's very
little difference between freesync and
cheese both allow a monitor to various
refresh rate in sync with the output
rate of the GPU both allow for features
like low framerate compensation there
are some minor differences precinct for
example supports Apple over HDMI and
juicing supports variable overdrive but
the key aspects of the technology are
basically functionally identical and as
an aside I don't agree that juicing
motors are consistently the fastest in
terms of input lag personally the
fastest monitors I've tested have been
Precinct lawyers anyway where the
differences come in is simply in what
each company allows to be branded as
either freezing or g-sync in other words
what passes the validation process
g-sync validation is significantly
stricter than freezing it requires
support for things like LFC it requires
wide refresh ranges good input lag no
technical issues and so on G tink is
more a brand that tells you overall
whether the display is delivering a good
experience freesync branding on the
other hand isn't really concerned with
monitor quality it's simply an indicator
to let buyers know that the panel
supports adaptive sync if it supports
adaptive sync it passes through sync
validation now I don't necessarily think
either approach is right or wrong
the g-sync badge is guaranteeing a
certain level of quality however that
comes at a significant price and there's
no technical reason why a free sync
monitor can't match a g-sync monitor in
terms of functionality and validation
it's just that with a free sync monitor
producing a quality display is up to the
monitor manufacturers while with g-sync
it's a requirement to get certified the
end result is for equivalent displays
freesync motors can deliver an identical
experience to gsync if the monitor REM
wants to and at a lower cost however the
trade-off these entry-level monitors
will have free sync browning and won't
be very good I also don't think that
having crappy entry-level free sync
miners with narrow refresh ranges is a
bad thing
these are monitors that previously
wouldn't have supported adaptive sync at
all and certainly wouldn't pass through
sync validation so including free sync
is a value addition at little cost sure
I guess the experience might not be
great but for entry-level monitors we're
talking about what we're not talking
about the difference between free sync
and gsync we're talking about the
difference
between freesync and no adaptive singing
and personally I choose to have adaptive
sync every time no matter the Refresh
range so I think most buyers should look
at G sync versus free sync in this way G
sync well it's kind of I guess a sticker
that certifies an experience if you
can't be bothered doing any research
into what monitors are good and don't
want to read reviews and that sort of
thing you can buy jisuk monitor knowing
that generally you'll be getting a
decent product but you'll pay for that
privilege
I guess it's similar to buying say a
pre-built system from a vendor like
ibuypower they're certifying everything
works with your new PC but you'll pay
more than researching and building it
yourself whereas free sync that's just a
sticker that tells you a monitor has
adaptive sync it's not certifying an
experience it's merely telling you that
a certain feature is supported some free
sync monos being crappy isn't a failing
of the brand for not having tight
validation processes because it was
never really the point of precinct and
is it the intention of the sticker like
I guess the HDMI sticker tells you the
monitor supports HDMI the free sync
sticker tells you the monitor supports
adaptive sync and you'll need to
research which monitors are actually
worth buying yourself any other final
comment I wanted to address you is from
Amer they say a monitor also
automatically fails in videos testing if
freesync isn't enabled by default in the
monitors settings and yeah that's an
interesting thing to bring up I suspect
a huge number of free sync monitors have
failed validation for failing two things
not supporting low framerate
compensation and not having free sync
enabled by default at a guess I'd say at
least half of all free sync monitors if
not more don't support AFC and then
another chunk of monitors that do
support LFC ship with precinct disabled
by default of course in both cases the
monitor the main support adaptive sync
just fine but I guess with those rules
you can see how out of 400 monitors
tested so many of them would fail yeah
so I guess that pretty much is it for
this video hopefully this is addressed a
few outstanding questions and concerns
with free sync on NVIDIA GPUs I'm
definitely glad to hear that most people
have managed to get their free sync
display working with no issues I think
we all expected that to be the case but
it's good to get confirmation from you
