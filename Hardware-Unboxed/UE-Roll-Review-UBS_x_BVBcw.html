available in the market today it's tough
for companies to come along with
something you need to set there for it
apart but I believe Ultimate Ears and
managed to do so with their low cost
waterproof disc-shaped you a roll set to
retire the you e-mini boom the roll
comes in at 100 US dollars $150 in
Australia and his little brother to you
is boom and mega boobs what's perhaps
most interesting about the roll is its
unique shape it's a flat disc
reminiscent of a typical UFO shape it's
just thirteen point four centimeters in
diameter and thirty point eight
centimeters thick and as such it's
extremely portable fitting comfortably
into your palm or a small pocket in the
backpack the portability doesn't end
there either
there's an attached thick marine grade
bungee cord you can use to tether the
roll to virtually anything you like as
long as it isn't too thick and the cord
also tucks away nicely when not in use
the overall design is kind of minimal
and definitely well thought out the
concave power and connect buttons are
tucked away nicely at the back where you
won't accidentally hit them and both
featured white indicator LEDs during the
other controls who find on the roll or
the large volume buttons on the face as
indicated by large stitched in symbols
is it easy to press and definitely well
located which is a plus the base of the
roll is made from soft and durable
feeling rubber and it features a
waterproof flap that protects the
microUSB charging port the
three-and-a-half millimeter input jack
up top it's all fabric which feels like
it would be quite durable to the roll
comes in six different colorways all of
which are pretty funky and look fitting
both indoors and out this tough exterior
adds up to deliver ipx7 waterproofing
which makes it splash proof and even
immersion proof so long as you don't
exceed one meter in depth for more than
thirty minutes is an example
as you can hear even submerge the audio
is not too bad it's makes it awesome for
hanging the shower taking to the beach
or having by the pool you even includes
a little life preserver for free when
your order for the role from their
website to so you can have it floating
by you as you swim the role doesn't
float on its own and I suspect for it to
do so would have resulted in a much
larger overall package as you can see
it's still alive
just keeps coming out I was really
impressed by the sound quality from
rolled all the way up until the drip
system noise that occurs when you hit
max volume mid-range sounds are strong
vocals come through cleanly of course
the Sun is loud and doesn't have as much
basis larger more expensive speakers but
honestly for its size it's actually very
impressive the volume in sound isn't
enough to throw a party but it's perfect
for hanging out with some friends in the
back yard at the beach or using the
bathroom or kitchen a couple of things
the roll doesn't have the speakerphone
capabilities and media controls you'll
have to rely on your pad Bluetooth
device to play pause and skip forward
and back as it features no other buttons
than the ones I mentioned earlier and
you won't be able to take calls on it
either first really whoever does that I
know I don't back to me live from the
roll is pretty good the claim 9 hours
was about right
I had it pumping at full volume on and
off for a couple of days and it
definitely last was at least 8 if you
have a friend or family member with a
role too you can use the viewer you roll
up to team up and play through both to
cover a wider space they can't make them
left and right speakers as you can with
the other Yui solutions I've got on the
Bluetooth performance of the rolled with
some of the best I've encountered the
range on this thing was fantastic and I
could rely on consistent streaming up to
10 meters comfortably with a claimed 20
meters working under suitable conditions
of course walls and whatnot willing to
fear to a degree but relative to other
solutions
this was honestly one of the best
overall the Ultimate Ears roll is a
really really cool little Bluetooth
speaker the simplicity of small size are
both appealing I really like the big
volume buttons up top the shape provides
360 degrees a very even sound it's
rugged waterproof and durable and the
attached bungee cord is actually very
convenient fantastic Bluetooth
performance rounds out in excellent
products and at 100 US dollars or 160
Ozzie I believe it's appropriately
priced is the roller compact rugged
bluetooth speaker you consider buying
why why not let me know in the comments
or an app or my hardware unbox calm and
don't forget to hit like and hit
subscribe I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
