week's episode of throwback Thursday
we're checking out the AMD radeon r9
280x which means we're also checking out
the Radeon HD 7970 here Hertz Edition
which is a factory overclocked 7970 and
for those of you unaware all three
models are based on the same GPU code
names tahiti xt this means they pack
2048 cos 128 texture mapping units and
32 render output units they all feature
the same gddr5 memory interface using a
384 bit wide memory bus
the only real changes have been made to
the core and memory clock speeds the
7970 gigahertz Edition and the r9 280x
are very similar in terms of clock
speeds and they're basically factory
overclocked versions of the original
7970 released in early 2012 in order to
better compete with the geforce gtx 680
and take back the performance crown AMD
decided to overclock the 79 and 70 by
almost 15% to create the 7970 gigahertz
edition for their efforts they charge an
additional $50 u.s. anyway 18 months
later with nothing new to push out the
7970 gigahertz Edition was rebranded as
the r9 280x the MSRP was dropped from
500 u.s. down to $300 u.s. so even
though we were getting the same
performance and basically the same
graphics card it was at least a fair bit
cheaper shortly after the release of the
280x the Radeon 200 series was completed
with some GC and second-generation parts
which included the uh nine to ninety to
ninety x and 295x2 we also got the
Radeon r9 285 which was based on the
third-generation GCN architecture but
that model was probably a bit of a flop
or at least it was in my opinion anyway
despite being a rebranded graphics card
the 280 X was actually a pretty hot item
at the new MSRP and sold quite well
today they can often be selling for
between a hundred and twenty one hundred
and ninety dollars us on the second-hand
market so given today's horrible market
conditions that places it alongside the
GTX 1050 and rx 560 so for those seeking
maximum bang for their buck which option
provides the best results well
we're about to find out representing the
old vintage GPU is the Sapphire vapor-x
r9 280x 3G model all testing has been
conducted on our Corsair GPU test rig
which comprises of a core i7 8700 k
clocked at 5 gigahertz with 32-year
bytes of vengeance ddr4 3200 memory the
Radeon r9 280x gets off to a flying
start in our battlefield 1 test and it's
the first older card we've revisited
this year capable of averaging more than
60 FPS in this title at 1080p using the
ultra quality settings as a result it
was 13% faster the GTX 1050 TI and 24%
faster than the GTX 680 which also means
the 7970 gigahertz Edition would be at
least 20% faster in this title moving on
a Dona for 3 and here we see the r9 280
continuing to tear the competition apart
with an average of 79 fps this minute
was 16 percent faster the GTX 1050 to an
18 percent faster than the HD 7950 and
GTX 680 I should also note that the one
percent low result of 59 FPS was greater
than the average result for the rx 560
and GTX 1050 the r9 280x also does well
in dirt 4 and here it managed to edge
out the GTX 680 by a 7% margin testing
was conducted using the median quality
settings so it's fair to say you could
crank up the visuals with the 280x next
that we have fer honor and for the first
time so far we see the gtx 680 beating
the r9 280x there only by a mere 4%
margin overall performance was good and
you could probably get away with higher
quality settings and still see an
average of over 60 fps
moving on to Ghost Recon wildlands in
here the r9 280x match the GTX 680 and
GTX 1050 while those 10% slower than the
GTX 1050 Ti so a reasonable result in
this title though we are only using the
low quality preset optimizations aren't
particularly great for this one then the
r9 280x runs away with it Mass Effect
Andromeda hitting 81 FPS on average
making it 14 percent faster than the GTX
680 it also edged out the GTX 1050 Ti
and crushed the g2 x 1050 then in pray
the 280x beats the GTX 1050 to while it
was comfortably ahead of the GTX 680 the
with both pushing over 60fps at all
times you'd probably struggle to spot
the difference the GTX 280 also blasted
the competition a Resident Evil 7
beating the GTX 1052 by a whopping 20%
margin and the GTX 680 by 23% so a clear
victory for AMD's rebadged HD 7970 here
we can see that on average across the
eight games tested the r9 280x was 10%
faster than gtx 680 though it has to be
said our spread of games is somewhat
kind to the red team and no this wasn't
intentional we recently saw that the HD
7950 struggled against the GTX 760 and
title such as counter-strike donut who
fought night overwatch and player on
owns battlegrounds had those titles been
included than the 280 X and the GTX 680
might have come out of this offering a
very similar level of performance so
just keep that in mind that said let's
move on to see how the r9 280x plays and
a few of these titles first up I played
a few rounds of Rainbow six siege and I
found on average that the r9 280x was
good for over 100 FPS at all times using
the medium quality settings at 1080p in
the same sections of the game the 280x
was roughly 30% faster the GTX 680
whereas the GTX 680 average of 108 FPS
with dips as low as 88 fps the 280 never
dropped below 106 FPS and this allowed
for an average of 139 fps we saw that
previously the r9 280x was over 20%
faster than the gtx 680 in battlefield 1
and this had a big impact on the quality
things that were able to use whereas the
gtx 680 was limited to the medium
quality things for playable performance
the r9 280x could handle the ultra
quality settings and still push over 50
FPS at all times when gaming at 1080p so
an impressive result here for the old
AMD GPU the r9 280x powered through
battlefront 2 using the higher quality
settings providing smooth highly
playable performance under the same
conditions it was 18% fast in the GTX
680 in this title and overall we saw an
average of 69 FPS with a minimum of 59
fps moving on the fortnight here we saw
an average of 105 FPS with drops down to
69 FPS and
and minitest although this performance
using the medium quality settings at
1080p is only comparable to what we saw
with the GTX 760 it's obviously still
very playable and if it certainly afford
to turn the quality settings up I'm not
John to although not an apples to apples
comparison with the GTX 680 and
overwatch we did use the same quality
settings and overall performance was
almost identical using the ultra quality
settings the r9 280x was silky smooth
churning at 87 FPS on average with a
minimum of 70 FPS so overall a great
result then finally I gave pub G a whirl
and here I was forced down to the medium
quality settings and this was also the
case with the GTX 680 in fact despite
playing on a different map we still saw
an average of 66 FPS the exact same
average as the GTX 680 so overall
performance should be very similar
between the two in my tests with the
280x I saw a minimum of 52 FPS with an
average of 66 fps so overall very
playable but if you want to maintain
over 60 fps at all times you will have
to go down to the low or very low
quality settings then finally we have
some power consumption figures the
Radeon r9 280x wasn't the most power
efficient GPU released in late 2013 and
remember it is still based on year and a
half old technology still compared to
the GTX 580 it was a massive improvement
and given that it beat the GTX 680 and
most of our tests included in this video
performance / what is still very good
also you have to keep in mind that we
are using an 8700 K clocked at 5
gigahertz and with the r9 280x this
combo consumed at less than 300 Watts
when gaming so it's not exactly gonna
put your power supply to the test well
they have a 2013 s Radeon r9 280x or
2012 HD 7970
looks to be very capable after all these
years of course you'd never normally
entertain the idea of spending well over
$100 US on one of these graphics cards
but today if you had a thousand of them
and you listed them all for $100 US they
probably all sell before week's end
because the way the market is right now
you can expect to pay around 170 dollars
u.s. and that's actually the average
sale price for 280x on a major in the
march period at the time of making this
video the
our X 560 and GTX 1050 cards are selling
for one hundred and six dollars u.s. at
best
while the 1052 is fetching at least two
hundred and twenty dollars u.s. given
the 280 X was on average nine percent
faster than the GTX 1050 Ti and the fact
that it costs around 20 to 25 percent
less makes it a very viable option
meanwhile for around the same money as
the vanilla 1050 we saw a 25%
improvement in performance of course
again it is worth noting that the much
older prior to the 280x does consume it
considerably more power and therefore
will run a bit warmer but the big
aftermarket models that I have on hand
from sapphire and a suits do run
reasonably cool and quiet the big hurdle
though for potential buyers is the fact
that these are secondhand graphics cards
with no chance of being replaced under
any kind of warranty should something go
wrong
all that said I'd put my budget cap for
a 280x at 150 dollars u.s. and there are
examples of working cards selling for as
little as a hundred and thirty dollars
u.s. but of course you'd have to be a
bit lucky to snag one of those anyway
for Tony P gaming the Radeon r9 280x is
still a great option and you can heap of
fun with it and that's where I'm going
