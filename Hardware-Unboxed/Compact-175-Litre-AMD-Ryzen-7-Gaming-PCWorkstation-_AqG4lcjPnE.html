today's video i'm building a pc it's not
just gonna be any old pc this one is
going to be small while also being very
powerful i know i've done small powerful
pcs before but this one isn't going to
cost more than your car that said i have
to admit it was initially going to be a
really affordable budget mini ITX build
because we haven't really done one of
those oh we did in the in wind chopin
but that was a bit different didn't have
a discrete graphics card you couldn't
really do any serious gaming on it
so it's meant to be a very capable but
affordable pc i'll probably still do
that video because i'm very interested
in doing it but yeah those plans went
out the window when I realized I had
these streak um da2 on hand it's a two
hundred and twenty dollar u.s. or three
hundred and twenty dollar Ozzie Mini ITX
case and I have to admit I have been
dying to build in it ever since I
unboxed it on unboxing boxes a few
months ago now so yeah the plan
initially was to grab an affordable mini
ATX case possibly with a power supply
combo or then just throw in an
affordable power supply then use the
Rison 520 600 processor pretty obvious
choice there and then the Radeon rx 570
graphics card so sort of combine my top
5 best bang for your buck CPU with my
top 5 best bang for your buck GPU so
that would have been a pretty cool
system again I do I will do that system
so for those of you who are disappointed
that I'm not doing it for this video I
will do that system at some point in
time probably early next year but anyway
for this video I want to work with the
DA too because I've had it for a while
and I have been dying to do some kind of
build and I've just been waiting for an
excuse and well I've got one now because
I've got a few new bits and pieces and
they can go in this case nicely but
because it is a more expensive case
putting a budget on the horizon 520 600
isn't exactly a budget CPU but it is
cheaper than the case so I thought well
we'll probably put the rise in 720 700 X
in there that probably makes a bit more
sense for this build
asrock also recently sent along their
new rx 590 graphics card and this is
their phantom in game
ex-ira see morale and yeah probably not
a perfect fit for this kind of bill just
given the price to performance at the RX
590 currently offers when we covered
that in depth in our review our day one
review but I still remain hopeful that
AMD will drop prices on these particular
cards and when they do and it'd be good
to have a bit of a database of certain
models and not just have the one model
that we've checked out so far from XFX
so yeah the asrock card is going to get
a bit of a test in this video I have
stuck with my original motherboard
choice though the motherboards actually
here that's the box you probably work
that much out for this build the x4 70
version might be a better fit it's about
$50 more but honestly it really isn't
that different
apart from slightly better USB support
though you won't really know notice that
on the Mini ITX board they're not
exactly brimming with USB port so anyway
this board is perfectly fine no real
need to spend more money there just
because we're using the Verizon 7 2700 X
so yeah as rocks be 450 gaming ITX AC
will fit the bill nicely for the memory
that one was pretty simple I had some of
the Corsair Vengeance RGB pro ddr4 4000
stuff available obviously we won't be
running it at that speed with the rise
in processor but we'll probably get it
up to 34 3600 and we'll really be able
to tune other timings on that Samsung B
die memory so that'll work nicely then
for the cooler we have the new corset h1
15 i RGB platinum and this is a really
nice cooler Tim use this in a builder
recently got some really great results
with the core I $9.99 ok so it is no
doubt gonna work very well on the rise
and 7 processor one of the main reasons
I've grabbed this cooler is because it
has a 280 millimeter radiator and the
da2 is meant to comfortably house a 240
millimeter rad but I want to see if we
can squeeze in the 280 millimeter model
because be pretty cool if we could if
not I will of course fall back on one of
the many 240 millimeter options I have
laying around the office of course IO is
with a 280 millimeter read that on
usual but it is pretty unusual to get
one in a mini ITX case that's only this
big I mean it's not the smallest of mini
ITX cases but it's still very small and
apparently you can fit a full length
graphics card in this which calm down I
was moving this on the way as I was
saying apparently you can fit a full
length graphics card or up to I think
it's 27 centimeters which is about what
this card isn't as you can see that
looks like it would fit quite
comfortably so we'll find out in a
moment then saving us a little bit of
space is the silverstone SX 600 G g4
gold this is an 80 plus gold a certified
power supply I've had this just sitting
around for a very very long time don't
recall what I got up for a while I had
it was on the shelf there behind me I
spotted it just as I was sort of
organizing this build so yeah that's a
good pass play 600 watts will be more
than enough or it'll it'll be enough to
run the horizon 7 2700 x with the RX 590
then for storage I've gone a little
crazy on the storage front nothing too
ridiculous but a little bit ridiculous
so for the boot drive I have the new
adata
xpg SX 8200 Pro and this is a one
terabyte nvme SSD so obviously an MDOT
to drive I got that recently again I
unbox that our unboxing boxes wasn't
expecting it but it is a very high-speed
nvme SSD so it has claims sequential
read and write speeds in excess of three
gigabytes I believe it's three gigabytes
for the right 3.5 gigabytes for read so
very very fast drive there and although
I'm not building this system for any
particular purpose it's so well I might
I might be I might be depending on how
it turns out because last year for
Computex Tim and I took a very high-end
a massively bulky laptop each with an
external I think that were 27-inch 1440p
displays because it's much easier to
video and it money not limited to
turning P and it turns out the monitors
were quite easy to fit in our suitcases
slim bezel lightweight LCD monitors and
it was really great hooking them up to
the laptops I made the laptops much
better to work from so will do we will
be doing that again for come
text 2019 and the laptops weren't
super-powerful so I had a quad-core I
think Tim had the new six core 12 thread
models from Intel yeah they take quite
some time to render out 4k footage a
rise in 720 700 x would be world's
better so I could I could get that in my
luggage no worries so if this build
works out really well like I'm hoping it
will then this may be my my mobile
editing rig so that's why I've gone with
a high-speed nvme SSD is the boot drive
I'm a scratch disk so we can use that
unfortunately the be 450 board and the
x4 70 Mineo exports from asrock only do
have a single ultra m2 slot so I
currently put one of them in but one
terabyte is fine for a portable editing
rig and then the most extreme part of
the storage would be this 14 terabytes
Seagate Barracuda hard drive I'm
including this because I suppose I'm
including it because I can I had this
just just sitting around it was provided
by Seagate and I haven't really given it
a proper test yet you know I was
planning on using it for my editing
right here at home
but yeah 14 terabytes would be very
handy in a single drive for on the go so
I'll whack it in here see if we can fit
it in there with everything else and
yeah that's that's gonna pretty much
cover us on the storage front so that's
a heck of a lot of PC hardware that
we're gonna try and cram into this mini
ITX case will be interesting to see how
that goes and the good news is we're
about to find out just before we get
into the build I have never built in one
of these cases before I haven't read the
manual I haven't seen anyone else do it
and I don't plan on reading the manual
because well it's the holidays and I
shouldn't be working anyway and reading
the manual just seems like a whole lot
of work they prove to have been worth
doing before the end of this build but I
kind of like fiddling around working out
how things go as we build and make a few
mistakes have to take a few steps back
to correct them so yeah it should be a
whole lot of fun so I think we should
probably get into it let's start winging
it
you
okay so that was fairly easy really I
only had to change the harddrive
orientation once so that I could fit the
radiator in properly but yeah
considering what we've managed to cram
in this small case I think that was
pretty good going speaking of the
radiator the 280 millimeter version on
the H 115 IRG be platinum just fits in
there with a few millimeters to spare so
very snug really there aren't any case
fans installed yet so we're just relying
on the two 140 millimeter fans on the
other side of the radiator which a push
ball sucking air through the system and
pushing the hotter air out the side
panel so it's probably possible possibly
possible to squeeze some case fans there
that's not something I've looked into
yet but that would definitely help
improve thermal performance if you could
put a few more fans in here that said
for such a compact built with some
relatively high end hardware inside I
have to say it does run really well
running a blender stress tests or the
CPU peak adjust 74 degrees which is
pretty good really for example using the
wraith prism box color and optimal
environment you're looking at
temperatures of around 90 degrees in
this same test after an hour so 74
degrees with a 280 millimeter all-in-one
liquid cooler in this tiny case is very
respectable in an ATX case with loads of
airflow that load temp will drop by 15
or 20 degrees but that's hardly
surprising we have no case fans in a
case the size of a shoebox removing the
case panels did drop temperatures quite
significantly so if you can modify these
panels for greater airflow than that
will make a big difference to check out
GPU temperatures I ran f1 2018 on a loop
for an hour and this saw the asrock rx
590 phantom gaming OC peak at just 83
degrees which is certainly getting up
there but having said that the XFX
rx 590 Fatboy hit 80 degrees in our GPU
test system which provides loads of
airflow removing the side panel saw the
phantom gaming OC dropped down to 75
degrees and that's a very respectable
temperature for an RX 590 or even an RX
580 graphics card the system was quite
loud under
nothing extreme but it was generating
fifty three decibels with the case
panels on when sitting a few feet away
from the system so you certainly knew it
was running from about a meter away we
had a reading of 51 decibels so not too
bad but yeah again you'll certainly know
that it's running still one at idle it
was very quiet at just 43 decibels and
the room floor noise was 41 decibels so
idle you barely know it's running
finally for those of you wondering I
took as rocks rx 590 Phantom gaming OC
out of the da2 and then stuck it in our
GPU test rig inside the crystal the
corsair crystal 570 X and that things
just filled with fans so it's pretty
much an optimal setup for airflow there
and under those conditions the peak GPU
temperature was just 74 degrees which is
just degree cooler than what we saw in
this case with the side panels removed
as it is at the moment so yeah not a bad
result there if you can even open up the
side panels on this case perhaps mod
them or whatever improve air flow that
would help obviously help improve
temperatures there as well not necessary
it's certainly stable and ran fine but
maybe if you want to overclock generate
a bit more heat than you need to remove
a bit more heat so opening out those
side panels would really help with that
I would just lastly inside the GPU test
system so the the 570 X the asrock rx
590 around 6 degrees cooler than the XFX
Fatboy so yeah that's a very impressive
result therefore as rocks rx 590 overall
I've really enjoyed building inside
these 3 come at da 2 it's a awesome
little case and now I just have to work
out how I'm gonna fit it in my luggage
so that I can smuggle it to Computex
2019 this would make for a very awesome
editing rig opposed to having to use one
of the laptops and I know some people
will comment say off 70 80 degree
temperatures that's so high but try
editing videos on a laptop they pretty
much don't drop much below 100 degrees
for the entire time the editing and
encoding and all that so they run very
hot and very very loud those little fans
will and make a hell of a lot of noise
so this would be a significant upgrade
in all
aspects possibly not sighs it'll be a
little bit harder to fit in but like I
said we take 27 inch monitors anyway so
what that what's a shoebox size PC
anyway I'll work that out at a later
date but anyway yeah cool little system
I think you guys will agree and oh I
should just know lastly how much it
costs because I know some people will be
wondering how much the whole build came
out to wasn't cheap it was 2,200 us but
keep in mind five hundred and fifty
dollars us of that budget I was sucked
up by the massive Seagate Barracuda 14
terabyte hard drive so if you can do
with a 2 terabyte hard drive 3 4
terabyte hard drive the build cost will
drop below $2,000 u.s. which I think for
a you know system of this power you've
got your risin 7 2700 X a fairly capable
graphics card one terabyte nvme storage
all that stuff so I think that's a
pretty reasonable price for what you're
getting anyway if you liked the video
