271 QX the latest and greatest gaming
monitor from Chinese display
manufacturer aoc earlier this year in
Beijing AOC announced plans to release
some seriously high-end gaming monitors
under the brand name Aegon and this new
27-inch 144 Hertz display is keying
things off being that this is a 144
Hertz display it targets the
ever-popular
2560 by 1440 resolution better known as
1440p or quad HD alright so here's the
deal guys right now I don't have all the
required gear to provide scientific
results so consider this as more of a
hands-on preview rather than an in-depth
review that said I have spent plenty of
time playing with this monitor so I can
certainly give you my thoughts and my
feelings about it before jumping into
the specs and all that good stuff let's
take a look around the monitor the left
right and top bezel measure just 12
millimeters thick while the bottom is 17
millimeters thick so a nice thin bezel
all around underneath the bottom bezel
on the right hand side of five small
buttons one of which powers the monitor
on the other four can be used to access
the on-screen display options however to
avoid having to fumble through the menu
with these controls AFC has included
their quick switch controller this
remote control allows the user to switch
effortlessly between modes adjust the
brightness contrast and other useful
features on the left hand side of the
screen you won't find any inputs though
the right side has a bit going on here
you'll find a pair of USB 3 ports along
with a separate headphone and microphone
jack both USB ports are powered and
there's even a dedicated charging port
which spin marked yellow this can be
used to charge your phone tablet or any
other vibrating devices you might take
to LAN parties giggity above the side
panel connectivity is what looks like a
small antenna this is in fact just a
headset hanger pretty nifty eh around
the back this area seemed wanted to get
to be a flashy alcm monitors in the past
I mean very much in no fields affair the
AG 2 7 1 QX has been given some Flair in
the form of a big red racing stripe this
is a 144 Hertz monitor after all so a
racing stripe for even more speed makes
a lot of sense right embedded in the
bottom of the go-fast Drive for another
2 USB 3 ports along with the type B USB
in
for connecting the hub to your PC
meanwhile on the opposite side we find a
gang of display inputs which includes
VGA and dual link DVI neither of which I
imagine anyone will use then we have
hdmi 2.0 hdmi 1.4 and DisplayPort inputs
ideally users will want to use these
inputs to take full advantage of the
monitor I should point out that the HDMI
1.4 port also supports MHL so it is
possible to input your phone or tablet
into this monitor to watch movies look
at photos play games or do whatever else
you do with your phone that will be
enhanced on the big screen finally there
are two three-and-a-half millimeter
jacks for connecting your computer's
audio to the monitor the audio out is
useful for that side accessible
headphone jack though it can also be
utilized by the dual three watt speakers
embedded in the screen as the model name
suggests this is a 27-inch screen which
provides an effective horizontal viewing
area of 597 millimeters and a vertical
viewing area of 336 millimeters the
total area of the monitor measures 623
millimeters wide 368 millimeters tall
and toward an 18 millimeters deep with
the stand attached in total the screen
and stand combo ways to 6.8 kilos so
it's very easy to pick up with one hand
in fact the top of the stand features a
neat little handle which makes
transporting it very easy when it comes
to the stand AFC has the skims by going
with a cheap plastic option with minimal
adjustment instead an all-aluminium
stand has been included the stand looks
great it's very durable and highly
adjustable in fact the AG 271 QX is so
adjustable that it puts cheap desk
chairs to shame firstly the stand can
swivel left or right by up to 20 degrees
and it does so quickly and smoothly
while zeroing it back into place is also
very easy it's also possible to tilt the
screen from a three point five degree
angle back to a twenty-one point five
degree angle this can be quickly done by
grabbing the screen and tilting into the
desired position it's very easy to move
but doesn't wobble around or tilt from
the angle you adjusted to then there's
the height adjust and like the tilt the
user simply slides the screen up or down
the stand to their desired height the
screen can be raised as high as 198
millimeters from the desk while I can go
as low as 65 millimeters it is possible
to pivot the screen at up to a 90 degree
angle as well so the Sam certainly is
very versatile so what about the screen
itself is 27-inch tear
panel features an aspect ratio of 16 to
9 for resolution of 2560 by 1440 the
response time is 1 millisecond graded
gray which is plenty of snappy for
fast-paced first-person shooters the
typical brightness rating is 350 Candela
per square meter while the typical
contrast ratio is a thousand one so
pretty typical stuff here the claim
viewing angles are a decent 170 degrees
for horizontal viewing and 160 degrees
for vertical viewing the dell ultrasharp
u3o for teens that I use for my editing
rigor considerably better when it comes
to the viewing angle and they rated 178
degrees for horizontal and vertical
viewing still the viewing angles of the
AG 271 QX is certainly acceptable the
key features this monitor is that 1440p
resolution coupled with the huge 144 her
to refresh rate however it's well worth
pointing out that the display also
supports adaptive sync technology aka
AMD is free sync there was some
confusion as to what the maximum
supported refresh rate for free sync was
on this monitor as initially auc claimed
compatibility range from 30 Hertz to 100
Hertz
however free sync actually works at the
maximum 144 hertz refresh rate allowing
the AG to 7 1 QX to guarantee completely
stutter and tearing free gameplay as I
mentioned before this isn't much of a
technical review as it's just me giving
my thoughts and feelings about the
monitor so with that let's get a little
hands-on with the testing to see what
it's like to game with the AG 2 7 1 QX
prior to my hands-on testing with this
monitor I have to admit I've spend very
little time playing around with 144
Hertz freesync enable displays that
being the case I was keen to check out
what the AG to several mine QX could do
at the moment whenever I get the chance
I like to play overwatch so this was the
first game I fired up and it's the
perfect candidate to take advantage of
that high refresh rate unfortunately
with free sync enabled and the refresh
rate set to 144 Hertz the game suffer
from severe screen tearing which I
wasn't able to get under control a quick
google search revealed that heaps of 144
Hertz free sync users are suffering from
the same problem I wasn't able to find a
fix so I moved on next I fired up doom
and having been so disappointed with my
experience in overwatch I wasn't sure
what to expect the second I loaded into
the game and you right away this is the
experience I was after the motion was
incredibly fluent and again looked
world's different what I've experienced
previously on my 60 Hertz monitor I
played a few other favorites such as
rocket League and the experience on the
AG 271 Q X was pretty incredible aside
from the lack of freesync supporting
games such as overwatch the only other
issue I ran into was a strange
flickering problem which happens when
using both hdmi and displayport
occasionally after exiting a game the
Windows desktop would flicker like crazy
in those considerable lag when dragging
Windows around the fix was to reset the
system this is an annoying issue and I'm
not sure if it's a bug with the monitor
or AMD as drivers pricing downunder sees
the ad 2 7 1 QX selling for roughly six
hundred ninety dollars I'm yet to see
this gaming monitor go on sale in the
u.s. that said a straight currency
conversion would see itself roughly 530
u.s. dollars though I suspect it will
sell for even less the Acer predator XG
278 you another 27-inch 1440p 144 Hertz
freesync monitor is currently selling
for 450 us that said here in Iceland
that same asa monitor cost us $550 so it
seems aoc aren't that competitive on
pricing right now which is a shame as I
really like this monitor but can't
justify spending 25 percent more what
should be a very similar screen when I
was working the AOC Aegon AG 2 7 1 QX
was incredibly impressive but lack of
recent support in some games and the
random flickering issue spot the
experience for me pricing is also of
concern especially given the issues just
mentioned unfortunately I do only have
this monitor online so I'll have to
reacquire it in the few months time to
see if the bugs of it ironed out what do
you guys think using a high refresh rate
monitor already let me know in the
