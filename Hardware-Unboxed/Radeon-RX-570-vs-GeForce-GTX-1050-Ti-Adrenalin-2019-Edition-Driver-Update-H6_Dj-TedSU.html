are revisiting the battle of the the
budget mid-range GPUs suppose that's
what we'll call them yeah the whole
mid-range GPU thing it's a bit crazy now
the price range is a lot broader than it
used to be but I will stick with me
range GPUs anyway as the title suggests
I am talking about the radial rx 574
gigabyte and geforce gtx 1050 TI now for
months I've been recommending to viewers
that you get the rx 570 if you're on a
budget well you're always on a budget
but if you've got less than $200 of your
budget to allocate towards the graphics
card I recommend looking for one with an
Rx 570 GPU really is the best value yeah
the best everything right now the best
value budget graphics card option and
I've been doing this without an updated
comparison with its nearest competitor
that would be the GTX 1050 Ti so I
thought it was about time that we
corrected that ok so I'm not going to
talk about specs or anything else at
this point I'm just going to assume that
you're all very familiar with these GPUs
so in total I've tested with 36 games
all of which have been tested at 1080p
and 1440p however I am only going to
discuss the results for 14 of the games
and then jump to our big performance
breakdown having said that if you want
to check out any of the graphs that we
didn't discuss they will be available
for free or the link will be in the
video description that'll point you over
to a public post on our patreon account
as usual our Corsair GPU test rig built
inside the crystal series 570 X has been
used and inside we have a core I 9 99
rec a clocked at 5 gigahertz with 32
gigabytes of ddr4 3200 memory I've
explained in the past why we test all
GPUs low end and high end with the same
extreme test system it's not as black
and white as some people make it out to
be not everyone uses the same quality
settings and resolutions so we aim to
provide the best middle ground possible
anyway I know the vast majority of you
get it so I won't go on about this let's
just get to the good stuff first up we
have shadow of the Tomb Raider a super
demanding title in terms of visuals and
using the highest quality preset it
was a bit overwhelming for the GTX 1050
TI while the 1050 TI was good for just
32 FPS on average the rx 570 pumped out
52 fps making it 63% faster that's
obviously a massive win for AMD that
said AMD enjoyed by far their biggest
win in strange Brigade here the 570
completely obliterates the 1050 TI
almost doubling its performance at both
resolutions at 1080p the radeon GPU is
93% faster at 1440p almost average 60fps
while the 1050 - I struggled with around
30 fps it's quite incredible that the
performance margins can't be that
extreme the RX 570 also easily beat the
gtx 750ti when testing with battlefield
5 and even the 1080p or 1440p in fact
whereas the 1050 TI was barely a provide
playable performance at 1440p the RX 570
was very playable with over 50 FPS at
all times admittedly for competitive
first person shooters that's not really
enough but these cards are intended for
1080p gaming and here the 570 maintained
well over 60 fps at all times Sniper
Elite 4 is another DirectX 12 title and
it can take advantage of acing compute
so unsurprised under the 570 absolutely
roast the 1050 TI
once again here here it was 75% faster
to AP resulting in a night and day
difference for the gaming experience
Monster Hunter world is a very demanding
title but even so using the highest
quality preset with the rx 570 it was
able to provide playable frame rates at
1080p the gtx 750ti though well not so
much here the radio and GP was a
whopping 62 percent faster has to be
said that both GPUs did perform rather
well in warframe today EP and although
the rx 570 was 35% faster the 1050 TI
did just fine with 91 fps on average the
performance difference was more
noticeable at 1440p although the 570 was
still 35% faster but again the margins
more impactful here as we are talking
about lower frame rates just cause for
isn't exactly the most well optimized
title to be released last year but still
the rx 570 was able to provide
performance at 1080p the same can't be
said for the GTX 1052 I however here the
GeForce GP was 33% slower now I was
going to discuss the Forza horizon for
results
but you'll see the margins for that
title in the big breakdown graph a
little later on in the video instead I
thought we could discuss GTA 5 and now
it's a very old game some of you point
that out when we do include it but it's
very popular and because of that if we
don't include it we get loads and loads
of comments asking us to include GTA 5
so here it is and I thought I would
discuss the results here because it is
quite interesting previously the GTX
1050 TI did best the RX 470 however it
seems through possible further driver
development and of course the factory
overclock the 570 is able to stick it to
the 1050 TI offering 10% more
performance so AMD does very well here
in what is a worst case scenario for the
RX 570 in its gtx 750ti battle moving on
Assassin's Creed Odyssey is typically a
bad title for AMD and they generally
come out well behind in this one that
said the RX 570 is sufficiently fast on
the GTX 1050 Ti and as such it manages
to come out with a win here and a decent
win at that offering 17% more
performance at 1080p more importantly
using the very high quality preset the
570 was able to keep frame rates above
30fps
at all times and therefore provide what
we call playable performance the gtx
750ti only averaged 35 FPS with frequent
dips below 30fps so the gameplay was
noticeably choppy next up we have hitman
2 and despite the lack of DirectX 12
support for this most recent installment
in the Hitman series the RX 570 storms
home for an easy win beating the gtx
1050 teait by a 41% margin the previous
version of hitman did support DirectX 12
and using it we find a pretty brutal
result here the RX 570 crushed the GTX
1050 to I by an incredible 64 percent
margin again pretty brutal stuff here
it's not the most extreme margin we've
seen but I think most fuel agree 64
percent is still a rather extreme margin
the good news for fortnight players is
that either of these GPUs will laugh
play performance at 1080p that said the
RX 570 was once again the superior
performer impressive given this title
uses the Unreal 4 engine which heavily
favors in video hardware anyway here the
RX 570 was 23% faster when looking at
the average frame rate and we are
testing with the latest AMD driver which
does improve Fortnite performance for
season 7 both the GTX 1050 Ti and rx 570
provided very playable performance at
Sony European Rainbow six siege
that's about the twenty eight percent
performance advantage the rx 570 did
enable a noticeably better gaming
experience and the last game that we're
going to discuss results for is World of
Tanks and here the 570 offered 33% more
frames at 1080p both did provide
excellent performance though but the
radeon GPU was of course faster and then
at 1440p the 570 was noticeably better
hitting 66 FPS on average I posted as 48
fps
for the 1050 TI upon release the GTX
1050 TI's reception could be best
described as lukewarm and this was due
to its lackluster price vs. performance
ratio that said as radio and prices
increased due to demand from
cryptocurrency miners the 1050 series
became very popular amongst gamers as
they didn't suffer the same price hikes
or didn't suffer them nearly to the same
degree as the Radeon GPUs
however radio pricing has now fallen
back down MSRP levels and in the case of
the RX 578 can often be had for less
than the $170 u.s. MSRP and that's been
the case for a few months now as we've
seen prices drop as low as $150 u.s. but
before we get a new pricing let's take a
quick look at how these two GPUs compare
overall in all 36 titles okay so the
Radeon rx 570 was 43% fast and the
GeForce GTX 1050 - on average at 1080p
across 36 modern or popular titles the
biggest wins was seen in DirectX 12
titles supporting async compute that
said AMD did sponsor strange Brigade and
Sniper Elite 4 so keep that in mind
meanwhile the smallest wins were seen in
Grand Theft Auto 5 and Assassin's Creed
Odyssey and neither title has proven to
be all that AMD friendly in the past but
even so the 570 was still
able to get up over the 1052 I hear so
that means even a worst case scenario
for the 570 meant a 10% victory so not
all that bad
typically though you can expect the 570
to be at least 20% faster again as we
saw on average it is over 40% faster if
you include enough games okay so the
radio and rx 570 is obviously the
superior product in terms of performance
and now that it can be had for the same
amount as the 1050 TI or generally it's
a little bit cheaper it's really the
obvious choice and that's why we've been
heavily recommending it for months now
it's pretty simple really
don't think there's much more to say on
this one or much more that we really
could say I will just know that the rx
570s power consumption is significantly
higher but even so it's not really
extreme at around 300 watts for a total
system using a high end processor so
while is extreme relative to the 1050 Ti
it's certainly not outrageous overall I
would like to just close by saying this
video has been a long time coming and
I've personally been working on it for
about two weeks now that said two weeks
of solid work didn't go into it I've
obviously been working on other projects
at the same time but over that period
any spare time has been diverted to this
content so that said my current issues
with Nvidia in no way reflects what has
been shown here or my interpretation of
the data as I said at the start of the
video I've been heavily recommending the
RX 570 ever since it dropped down to 150
dollars us and in that time I have not
once revisited performance so we've done
that now and now I can focus my
attention on the big RT X 2060 benchmark
