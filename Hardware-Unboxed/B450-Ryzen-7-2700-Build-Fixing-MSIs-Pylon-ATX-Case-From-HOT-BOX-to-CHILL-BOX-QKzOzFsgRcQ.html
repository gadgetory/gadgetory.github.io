you're all having a nice relaxing
weekend by myself having a fairly
relaxed weekend although I just couldn't
help myself I thought we haven't done a
build for a while so be 450 boards
coming out next week probably a good
time to do a build video actually
speaking of the be 450 motherboards they
weren't meant to be available to the
public till the 31st of July but for
some reason some retailers started
selling them last week so not sure
what's going on there has to be said
quite an odd release from AMD this one
so while you could technically buy one
right now and test it out for yourself
and we are bound by multiple NDA's and
can't show you a single benchmark I
can't talk about vrm thermals or
anything like that so this is mostly
just a build video that said I'll be
using the arisin 720 700 on MSI's newbie
450 tomahawk motherboard and we'll be
calling it with the new deep cool Castle
240 millimeter all-in-one liquid cooler
and I will provide some CPU thermal
results so it won't be just a system
build also along for the riders MSI's
new Radeon rx 580 MEK 2 8 gigabyte OC
graphics card so we can also check out
how that performs in terms of thermals
as well all this new hardware will be
going inside the new MSI magpie lon ATX
case and yes this is a very MSI themed
build but no it hasn't been sponsored by
MSI if I had sponsored this video we
would certainly make that clear
accompanying all the new MSI hardware is
aiders xpg spectryx d41 RGB memory and
we have for 8 gigabyte ddr4 3600 sticks
then for the boot drive we have the a
data xpg gamax s11 480 gigabyte nvme SSD
so some seriously nice hardware there
from a data finally powering everything
is the C Sonic focus gold 650 watt power
supply which will provide this build
with more than enough juice ok so enough
chitchat I reckon it's about time to
you're a smooth tune and get building
okay so that'll went very smoothly MSI's
pylons very easy to work with and I
think with that a data xpg memory and
the deep cool castle all in one liquid
cooler in there I think were those two
it looks a bit special but what about
the temperatures you say well the msi
pollen does leave a little to be desired
when it comes to thermals now thankfully
with some minor tweaks that you may have
noticed already and you can improve
things quite dramatically which I
suppose is both good and very
disappointing at the same time but we'll
get to that in a moment for testing I
left everything pretty much as a sort in
the video but I did replace the two fans
here with the two that I put up here
because they're meant to go on the
castle 240 millimeter radiator so those
fans were then put up here so the top
and the rear so that's all I did there
so we could actually test the castle
with the intended fans this did create a
bit of a mismatch with the fans on the
further case which didn't look
particularly nice so I've changed that
back and it didn't actually impact
performance much anyway
you can adjust the rpm of all these fans
so overall it was very similar anyway
with this configuration be Verizon 7 and
2700 hit 63 degrees under full load in
our our along a blender stress test
which is pretty similar to what we see
with the box cool on an open testbed so
it wasn't particularly impressed with
those results having said that though
the castle isn't to blame here as you'll
see you soon yeah not the only one
liquid coolers fault then playing
battlefield one we saw the CPU hit 49
degrees which isn't actually too bad and
the msi radeon RX 580 mac - that peaked
at 81 degrees which is pretty warm even
for an RX 580 so you know a great
temperature there for the graphics card
though I should note the operating
volume wasn't that bad unfortunately I
can't give you any scientific
measurements because it's the weekend
and it's not particularly quiet in my
house anyway those temperatures didn't
impress me at all I was honestly
expecting much better results out of
this system
I remember the rise in seven 2700
processor isn't even overclocked
something I know just straight away when
I unboxed the pile on PC and then
again when I was building in it was the
very limited gap that was here you can
see it's been slightly modified now
compared to the footage you probably saw
earlier though it might be difficult to
see it from this angle anyway
the gap at the front was extremely small
and very restrictive and basically when
you have such a small gap on a solid
front panel pushed up right against
three 120 millimeter fans they don't
like that it completely kills their
efficiency and limits their ability to
draw cool air into the case to then cool
down everything in there now if I
haven't mentioned it yet the gap was
just six millimeters so I couldn't even
fit my pinky finger in the gap as it was
out of the box that being the case I
decided to retest do everything all over
again but this time with the glass front
panel completely removed so we just had
the dust filter on the front of the case
and I was expecting to see some
noteworthy gains I mean we've got three
120 millimeter fans I was expecting to
see the operating temperatures of the
CPU and GPU dropped a bit
I wasn't expecting them to drop by quite
as much as they did and the idle
temperature alone that was dropped by
seven degrees which is that's a fairly
decent drop right there but it was
nothing like what we saw under load the
horizon 720 700 in the hour long blender
workload saw the peak temperature
dropped by 22 degrees so 22 degrees
knocked off the low temperature in a
room with an ambient air temperature of
21 degrees in battlefield one the CPU
temperature was also reduced by 19
degrees this time and the RX 580 saw a 6
degree drop taking it down to a much
more reasonable 75 degrees these are
obviously exceptional gains and if I
owned the pylon I saw this information I
would probably just decide to run it
without the glass front panel on it all
because I can't imagine why you want
your CPU to run 22 or 20 degrees hotter
than it actually needs to anyway the
good news is you don't actually have to
ditch the nice glass panel
you just have to increase the clearance
so do a little bit of modding so I dug
out some old CPU cooling gear I had a
couple of standoffs that are a bit
taller so I screwed them in add some
rubber washers and then put these giant
thumb screw thing
on the front which I wouldn't recommend
going with for sort of a permanent setup
but for the purposes of doing this test
and extending that six millimeter gap to
18 millimeters they serve the purpose
just fine regardless of whether my
little modification makes the case look
worse or not it's not really important
here what is important is that it didn't
make the thermals any worse in fact it
dramatically improved things incredibly
when compared to having no glass front
panel at all so the the improved results
that we just spoke of so no glass panel
at all
adding the glass panel back but
increasing they get with my modification
so the CPU load temperature in the
blender our long workload increased by
just four degrees and then the Radeon rx
580 that increased by just a single
degree again over not having the glass
panel at all so yeah with my
modification just a single degree was
added to the graphics card so impressive
stuff there and it means my dinky little
modification that took me about I don't
know 30 seconds maybe 60 seconds to what
the longest part was firing the bits
anyway that reduced the CPU load
temperature by almost 30% and it reduced
the load temperature of the GPU by about
6 percent so the pylon was now cooler
and quieter so well worth tripling the
size of the gap at the front of the case
here whether it looks better or worse in
my opinion it really doesn't make much
difference at all it's a bit
disappointing that MSI dropped the ball
so badly here it would have been an
innovative feature or something and that
you don't really see that often if they
had a thought to add some different
sized standoffs and various sizes maybe
you could go six millimeters which was
the stand and 12 millimeters 18 maybe
over 20 I don't know or maybe adjustable
standoff so just one set of stand ups
that can slide the glass panel in and
out that'll be pretty cool and it'll be
something that I don't think anyone else
offers so you'd be able to customize the
look and the amount of airflow that you
can get in the case depending on what
component Chevy now if you have a really
low end system six millimeters would be
fine but for a rise in seven processor
22 degree reduction by tripling the gap
there so I think it's well worth it
anybody that would
a unique feature that would be well
worth adding to the pylon - as for the
MEC - yeah pretty decent rx 580 graphics
card I haven't done a huge amount of
testing the thermals weren't overly
impressive but once we opened up the
case 75 degrees that's not too bad for
an Rx 580 if you guys want to see a
teardown
a detailed review I can certainly make
that happen so let me know in the
comments section below
and that's going to do it for this one I
hope you enjoyed the video if you did
leave a like again
comments below do all that good stuff

patreon you can get access to our
discord chat and monthly livestream
that's a labor fun hey that is gonna do
