right now I'm taking a quick break from
the RX for a benchmark Ryan to give you
an update on my progress and plans
benchmarking is going well obviously I
can't tell you guys anything concrete
right now in terms of performance or
specifications that are yet to be
announced as I've signed a nondisclosure
agreement with AMD so unfortunately
you'll have to wait a little longer to
find out what exactly am these are x 480
has to offer what i can tell you those
that my benchmark review will cover 23
games at three resolutions and follow
the same format as my gtx 1070 and 1080
updated benchmark videos i'll be
discussing individual game results at
1080p in 1440p 49 of the 23 games tested
before moving on to break all the data
down i'll also be looking at cost per
frame data and performance per watt 2 in
a separate video released at the same
time i will cover the radiant r x 480
specifications and features along with
the tour of AMD's reference card will
additionally be a separate overclocking
video again like what I did with the GTX
1070 and 1080 now for the big news
thankfully I have been able to get my
hands on a second RX 482 so once I
finish up with a main benchmark video
I'll even have some crossfire results
for you all shortly after so hit
subscribe stay tuned and the very moment
I can release all this info both the
video and the written versions will be
going live thanks for tuning in sorry I
