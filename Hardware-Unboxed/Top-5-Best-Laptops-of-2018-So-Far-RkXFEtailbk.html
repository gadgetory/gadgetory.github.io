couple of weeks ago you might have seen
my recommendations for the best 5 gaming
laptops you can get right now well in
today's video we'll be covering the best
laptops in general not just for gaming
across five key categories if you're
thinking of buying a portable
productivity oriented device a beast for
gaming or even something on the cheaper
end of the scale this video will have
you covered let's get right into the
pics with the category of laptops I
personally use the most the ultra
portables
this is a category that's really tricky
to pick a winner in because there are so
many high-quality ultra portable laptops
on the market today
every company from Dell to a sous to
Lenovo to HP and more all have a
fantastic top-end laptop option and to
be honest for the most part you can't go
wrong with many of these flagship models
however when dialing down into the specs
features and performance the standard
option in my opinion is the soos Zen
book 13 UX 331 U n in the past I've been
a huge fan of the Dell XPS 13 Lenovo
ThinkPad x1 carbon and razor blade
stealth and all three of these options
came into serious consideration for this
category but the ascend book 13 offers
something the other laptops are do not a
proper discrete GPU it may not be a
powerful GPU capable of hardcore gaming
but the NVIDIA GeForce MX 150 included
in this laptop is much faster than
intel's integrated graphics even though
it's only the slower one d12 variant of
this GPU as for the cpu well would only
recommend something with at least a quad
core in 2018 and in the case of most
high-end ultra portables that's intel's
eighth generation kb lake refresh line
the Zenbook 13 is equipped with either
the core i5 8250 U or the core i7
8550 u depending on the price on with
RAM and storage options that stone 8 gig
and 256 gigabytes respectively these are
standard specs for a high-end laptop and
really would expect nothing less for
this category other than that you get a
13.3 inch 1080p touchscreen which we
prefer over higher resolution options
for the extra battery life it provides
speaking of battery they included a 50
watt hour battery isn't the largest
we've seen but reputable reviews suggest
it's on par with the other laptops we
consider for this category namely the
XPS 13 93 70 and the ThinkPad x1 carbon
sixth generation we'd never settle for
short battery life and that's not
something you have to worry about with
the Zenbook 13 while a really solid
choice and I particularly love the
discrete GPU the Zenbook 13 isn't
perfect it's missing Thunderbolt 3
connectivity and the keyboard isn't as
good as what you get with something like
a think pad with that said it offers a
highly competitive set of hardware
starting at $1000 in fact
it's cheaper than similarly configured
options from Dell and Lenovo's high in
ultra portable lines factoring the
attractive value proposition and UX 331
un is a really great choice
our pick for the best convertible laptop
almost made into the list as best ultra
portable overall however with the
starting price of nearly $2,000 for a
suitable configuration it's probably not
the most affordable option for everyone
however the 13-inch Microsoft Surface
book 2 does provide an extremely
compelling feature set including the
best Hardware you can get in a 13 inch
form factor
combined with the screen that detaches
from the base for those times you need a
portable tablet when you choose the core
i7 model you get Intel's top-end KB like
refresh CPU the core i7 8650 you but on
top of that you also get an nvidia
geforce gtx 1050 discrete GPU which is
much more powerful than the MX 150 we
typically see in these sorts of devices
and that extra power does help to drive
the gorgeous high resolution 3000 by
2013 point five inch LCD which reaches a
3:2 aspect ratio that's awesome for
productivity apps those two features
doesn't stop there the touchscreen
display sports the best active styles in
the business the surface pen which
admittedly is a $100 extra but it's
definitely worth it for those who like
to annotate and draw the magnesium
chassis is one of the best you can get
on any laptop and it now includes USB C
although there is no Thunderbolt 3
support the battery life is also quite
good for a laptop that's so powerful our
favorite configuration of the service
book 2 would be the 13-inch model at
$2,500 which provides the core i7 gtx
1050 16 gig of ram and 512 gig SSD it is
a very expensive laptop there are
definitely cheaper convertible laptops
going around but you won't find anything
as powerful in fact the race really
isn't that close in my opinion the
surface book 2 is what you buy when you
want the best
it was only a few months ago the intern
release their new lineup of six core
coffee Lake processes for laptops so far
most of these CPUs have ended up in
gaming laptops but sometimes you might
be after a more professional portable
productivity oriented device it's not as
expensive but still provides high
performance Hardware ticking all those
boxes is the Dell XPS 15 and 95 70 which
is our current choice for those that
need productivity power on the go the
Dell XPS 15 has been a favorite of ours
for some time now but the new 95 70
model provides such a great combination
of performance Portability and price for
one thousand seven hundred dollars or so
you get a six core Intel Core i7 eighty
seven fifty eight CPU sixteen gig of ram
of 512 gig SSD and a 15.6 inch 1080p
display with super slim bezels and of
course an nvidia geforce gtx 1050 Ti
discrete GPU plus a huge 97 one hour
battery and Thunderbolt 3 connectivity
now this isn't the cheapest laptop to
include the sort of hardware you can
quite easily find a chunky gaming laptop
for 1,200 bucks like the seuss ROG Strix
car that will satisfy your hardware
craving but the key thing about the XPS
15 is its Portability and battery life
the overall laptop footprint is smaller
due to slimmer bezels it's more than a
kilogram lighter and we're looking at a
thickness of more like 15 millimeters
rather than 24 millimeters all while
providing a battery that's more than 50
percent larger and last of course
considerably longer now there are slim
and light gaming laptops out there like
the msi Gio 65 and gigabyte air of 15
both of which provide an equivalent CPU
and faster GPU but even though these are
slim and light gaming machines the Dell
XPS 15 is still more portable and
several hundred dollars cheaper while
preserving key productivity oriented
features shortly discrete GPU is just a
gtx 750ti rather than a gtx 1060 like
you get with the decent portable gaming
laptop but the 1050 TR will be more than
enough for tasks like video editing code
compiling simulations and so forth plus
if you want to do more than just
occasional gaming a gaming laptop might
be a better option for you anyway
I've recommended this laptop before and
I'll recommend it again because it
provides such great value for money if
you're after a sub one thousand dollar
laptop and just want the best hardware
you can get look no further than the
Acer Aspire a 15 which retails for
around $600 a lot of the hardware this
laptop provides you also finding top-end
devices you're saving upwards of four to
five hundred US dollars and that's no
small amount for a budget shopper the
aspire a 15 really has everything you'll
want from a hardware perspective the CPU
is Intel quad core Core i5
8250 you and that's combined with an
nvidia geforce MX 150 discrete GPU yep
you're getting a discrete GPU and a CPU
that's pretty powerful in this $600
laptop but there's more you also get
eight gig of ram a 256 gig SSD which are
both great inclusions in an entry-level
product we wouldn't recommend buying a
laptop with no SSD and with less than a
gig of ram but this Acer machine
includes both the display is a fairly
basic 15.6 inch 1080p LCD and the
battery life from all reports is decent
but not outstanding the key thing you
don't get with this budget laptop but
you do get with the more expensive ultra
polish we mentioned earlier is a fancy
design the aspire 15 has a basic chassis
that lacks the slimness lightness and
mel chassis of the best laptops at 2.4
kilograms heavy it's not the most
portable 15 inch laptop going around but
what this thing lacks in design and
builds it makes up for in performance
amazingly though the aspire 15 does
include a USB C port though it is
limited to just USB 3.0 engine 1 speeds
and there is also an attitude 11 AC
Wi-Fi solution with mu-mimo support
there's even a DVD drive something you
don't often see in laptops these days
it's not the absolute cheapest laptop on
the market you can still get atom
powered Windows devices and of course
Chromebooks for less but the combination
of hardware and value makes this buy a
15 incredibly hard to pass up
if you saw my video on the best gaming
laptops this section on the best gaming
laptop will probably sound a bit
familiar there are lots of different
categories of gaming laptops to choose
on but our favorite is the portable yet
powerful gaming machine and there's no
better option right now than the MSI
here 65 stealth in we were always a fan
of MSI's previous thin gaming laptop in
the chair 63 but the GS 65 is an
improvement in every way
there's a new Intel Core i7 8750 H CPU
Plus slimmer bezel surrounding a faster
144 Hertz 1080p display which helps
shrink the entire footprint of the
laptop it's still very thin and light
for this class of device and the new
design with gold highlights looks even
better than ever as for gaming
performance the GS 65 comes with two GPU
options a gtx 1060 or a gtx 1070 max-q
either option is a sound choice in their
respective price point though the gtx
1070 max-q model is better suited to
gaming on the 1080p high refresh display
and gives you more power in the same
form factor other features like 16 gig
of ram and a 512gb SSD as standard for
this laptop and its competitors we open
for the GS 65 over competing laptops
from gigabyte and soos for a couple of
reasons
the GS 65 is quieter than the similar
gigabyte era 15 extra in gaming and the
build quality is superior with both
laptops coming in around the same price
it was a tough choice between the GS 65
and a soos rog zephyrus MGM 500 won the
Zephyrus is more powerful with a full
GTX 1017 side rather than the max q
variant but it's also louder hotter and
more expensive as a result the GS 65 has
a larger battery and that lasts longer -
and that's important for a portable
gaming laptop either the g65 all the
Zephyrs would be our pick depending on
what you're after but if we had to
choose just one the more well rounded GS
65 gets our vote in this category and
that's it for this look at the best
laptops if you have any other great
picks be sure to let us know in the
