today I'm taking a break from
benchmarking to bring you what I think
is going to be quite an interesting
comparison as some of you are probably
aware I'm currently working on a big GPU
update that compares all the current
generation AMD and NVIDIA GPUs in one
big free-for-all along the way it
occurred to me that I already have the
data in for the full gigabyte 480 the 8
gigabyte 480 as well as the 6 gigabyte
1060 and 3 gigabyte 1060 so I thought
wonder hit the pause button and take a
good look at how these four models stack
up in late 2016 after all it could be a
good time to pick yourself up a cheeky
Christmas present and well I'm happy to
help with that the last time we made
this kind of comparison or at least
compared the 8 gigabyte 480 and 6 you
give out 1060 cards the geforce card was
found to be on average 12% faster across
the 25 games that we tested as expected
the low-level api results were closer
but with a vast majority of games still
using DirectX 11 Nvidia seemed to have
an advantage not willing to just accept
that AMD has been working their
backsides off and their recent crimson
relive driver update is evidence of this
not only is their driver support
improved but so to have the number of
tiles they have well how should I say
this crest to market games such as
titanfall 2 and Call of Duty infinite
warfare for example these games work a
treat on AMD Hardware while the big
blockbuster title that is battlefield 1
also enjoys a bit of Radeon action all
three games plus many more weren't
available back when we first tested the
RX 480 and gtx 1060 now that they are I
thought why not stick to 2016 titles for
this comparison we pretty much know at
this point how these cards get on in
2015 titles or at least we should anyway
I've only benchmarked them half a dozen
times also over the past 5 months
so in summary I've got both versions of
each graphics card the 3 &amp;amp; 6 gigabyte
1060 and the 4 &amp;amp; 8 gigabyte 480 I also
have the latest drivers from each camp
and a whole squad of 2016 triple-a
titles so that right there is the
makings of a great
benchmark session in total will be
roughly 500 benchmark runs completed at
the 1080p and 1440p resolutions on our
overclocked core i7 test system I'm
going to focus mostly on the 1080p
results for this comparison and just
gloss over the 1440p numbers when we're
looking at the individual games
basically - I've done that so you're not
still here tomorrow watching this video
that's how I will cover both 1080p and
1440p results in detail in the
conclusion some big graphs that look at
all the games side by side so you get a
quick sense of what's going on anyway
without further ado let's get to the
benchmarks so rewinding all the way back
to January we find one of the most
graphically impressive games of 2016
rise of the Tomb Raider gamers spent
hours enjoying the swimming animation in
this one and at 1080p or 4 these
graphics cards provided very smooth
motion this is an Nvidia supported title
so the results aren't terribly
surprising the GTX 1063 gear bite led
the eight gigabyte rx 480 by a slim
margin it was of course the 60 about
1060 that was King here jumping or 1440p
we're still able to average around 60fps
on all cards and here the 8 gigabyte 480
hops ahead of the 3 gigabyte 1060
meanwhile the 3 gigabyte 1060 and 4
gigabyte 480 both averaged 58 fps with
the same 34 FPS minimum the game where
sticks and stones will actually break
your bones was released back in March
and it's another visual bonanza with the
HD texture pack enabled the 3 gigabyte
1060 makes out surprisingly well
matching the a gigabyte our X 480
now 1440p we see very similar
performance across the board and again
the a gigabyte rx 460 just manages to
outclass the gtx 1060 the division was
also released back in March March 8 in
fact but it only had the legs to remain
fun until the end of March though still
playing and have to be caught in some
kind of Groundhog Day situation I'm Dean
and video trade blows here the six
gigabyte 1060 provided the best minimum
frame rate result though the eight
gigabyte R X 480 edged ahead for the
average frame rate the three gigabyte
1060 did drop a bit off the
pase though still managed a very
respectable 60 FPS average jumping to
1440p the margins are similar though
this time the four gigabyte rx 480 and
60 gigabyte 1060 are trading blows
hitman another title released in March
and I'm not sure what else to say about
this one I didn't really like the game
that much so I've actually spent more
time benchmarking it rather than
actually playing anyway it's an AMD
special radians runaround for FPS fast
using DirectX 12 while the geforce cards
run about four fps slower so in an
effort to keep things fair especially
since this game doesn't really require
DirectX 12 support at least not in the
way that a game such as ashes does for
example I have tested AMD cards using
DirectX 12 and NVIDIA cards using
DirectX 11 the six key about 1060 wasn't
that far behind for the minimum frame
rate but it does get a little trampled
when comparing the averages meanwhile
the three gigabyte version quietly slips
out the back door claiming there's
nothing to see here
moving to 1440p the performance trends
ran pretty much the same and again AMD
still leads the way here quantum break
was first released as quantum broken on
the Windows Store in April but was later
fixed as a direct accel levin only title
for steam in September this is when I
started benchmarking with the game
unfortunately there's no direct extort
for AMD cards on the steam platform this
could possibly help even things up here
as it stands in videos ten sixty series
runs away with it scoring a rather easy
win the same is seen at forty or forty P
and even the three gigabyte 1060 is able
to hand the eight gigabyte R X 480 a
rather hefty defeat overwatch is updated
more regularly with new characters and
maps than the guys playing it change
their underwear that is to say that it's
somewhat addictive and Blizzard has been
heavily invested in the title helping
along the craze is the fact that the
game would play on an abacus here we see
that with the ultra preset enabled the
gtx 1060 hums along at 1080p to the tune
of 176 fps never dipping below 138 fps
the 8 gigabyte R X 480 was a fair bit
slower though it did never dip below 116
fps meaning you probably won't notice
even at 1440p or graphics cards pushed
over 60 FPS at all times and while the
8-gigabyte rx4 80 did just edged out the
three gigabyte 10 60s minimum result it
lost out when comparing averages doom
was released in May and at the time it
was a big kick in the berries for AMD as
the then exclusive OpenGL support had
the r9 390 rendering less frames than
the GIMP - heigh-ho gtx 780 Ti here have
our box we don't believe that Nvidia get
their drivers is a big misunderstanding
I wish I never said nothing Bethesda and
AMD finally made up in July and it was
good timing
the new Incredible Volcom performance
allowed AMD to sweep some story about a
PCIe power draw issue under the rug and
while we all got on with our lives since
then it's been a one-sided beating in
this title but the geforce cards are
like hey we don't mind we're still
pushing over 100 FPS go back and look at
those quantum break numbers some more
rather than do that we'll just jump to
the 1440p results for some more green
pain granted even here all four graphics
cards are pushing over 60 FPS at all
times those with high refresh monitors
will appreciate what the RX 4 series has
to offer here ashes of the singularity
has pretty much run its course now but
AMD is in luck the much more popular
total war Warhammer arrived in May with
DirectX 12 support that is still marked
as beta despite working flawlessly AMD
are able to pull ahead in this one the 8
gigabyte R X 480 provides decent gains
over the GTX 1066 gigabyte card moving
to 1440p there's six gigabyte 1060
closes in on the 4 gigabyte rx 480 and
even the three gigabyte 1060 makes out
quite well Mirror's Edge catalyst which
was released back in June provides a
close battle here the three gigabyte
1060 sits between the RX 4 80s while the
6 gigabyte version pulls slightly ahead
overall Nvidia is a whisker faster here
but there really isn't much in it we
find much the same at 1440p it's
interesting to note how similar three
gigabyte and 6p about 1060 models are in
terms of performance if only the rear
left ones were this competitive that
said I was surprised to find Andy coming
out on top here as the 8 gigabyte R X
480 beat out the gtx 1066 gigabyte by 5
FPS at 1080p
interestingly in video were a bit more
competitive at 1440p and we see very
similar minimum frame rates across all
four graphics cards by far the biggest
released of August was Deus Ex mankind
divided though disappointingly the game
wasn't released with DirectX 12 support
anyway DX 12 support has now been
patched in and it's even been updated a
few times still you can't really claim
that DirectX 12 gives AMD an advantage
in this title since the Radeon still
knock off the geforce cards even when
using DirectX 11 given their performance
is much the same under both AP is in
this game we've tested all cards using
DirectX 12 again the 1060 was slower but
it wasn't exactly by a great margin
moving to 1440p the six gigabyte 1060
hangs in there with the 4 gigabyte 480
while the three gigabyte version claims
not enough vrm and starts a slideshow
presentation about it battlefield 1 is
another game where I've tested the AMD
cards using DirectX 12 and the Nvidia
cards using DirectX 11
even with the new real live driver we
still find that a video is able to stay
ahead here the six gig 1068 class the
eight gig 480 while the three gig 1060
matched the average framerate of the
four gig 480 while providing a slightly
stronger minimum result jumping to 1440p
things even up quite a bit and in videos
lead he is very slim indeed it was great
to see all four graphics cards averaging
over 60 FPS at 1440p using the ultra
quality settings mafia 3 yeah well look
at the 2016 title and I didn't sail to
only include well coded games using the
high quality settings none of these
graphics cards are able to average 60fps
at 1080p the GTX 60 gabite was clearly
the best option here while the three
gigabyte version beat the 4 gigabyte our
X 480 moving to 1440p AMD closes the gap
significantly and now pretty much
matches the geforce cards the only game
that's been able to force me into the
horrible Windows Store is Gears of War 4
and while I like the game I also hate it
for that anyway given enough time I'll
probably get over it here we see the 6
gigabyte 1060 and a gigabyte 480 going
head-to-head delivering the same 84 FPS
meanwhile the 4 gigabyte 480 is able to
outdo the 3 gigabyte
1060 jumping the 1440p the three
gigabyte 1060 does fall further behind
while the a gigabyte 480 and 60 by 1060
both deliver similar performance once
again those GC n powered Titans run best
on Radeon graphics cards and here we see
more evidence of that although the
minimum frame rates were much the same
the our X 480 provided better average
framerate performance that said the
margins close up at 14 for DP at least
when comparing the six gigabyte 1060
civilization six looks to be a title at
favors the green team the margins
weren't drastic but the three gigabyte
1060 did outpace the a gigabyte our X
480
even at 1440p we did find much the same
story so I have nothing else to add here
this latest Call of Duty title almost
ensures the gamers will spend an
infinite amount of time in the lobby
trying to find a game because everyone's
playing battlefield 1 yup infinite
warfare is at a rough life and it's just
one month old despite the lack of
players it does seem to play rather well
on PC the GTX 10 63 gigabyte is the
slowest graphics card here and it still
pushed over 60 FPS at all times with the
quality settings maxed out still it is
the our X 480 s that delivered the best
result here and the 4 gigabyte model can
be seen rendering over 70 FPS at all
times now at 1440p the AMD cards pull
further ahead
both the 4 gigabyte and 8 gigabyte our X
480 cards average over 60 fps while the
1060 s falls short since our initial
dishonored to testing the game's
performance has been dramatically
improved particularly those minimum
frame rates at 1080p and video still
looks to have the more consistent
performance in this title the 3 gigabyte
1060 is just able to edge out the 8
gigabyte 480 when comparing the average
frame rate while the minimum is much
stronger jumping to 1440p we find a
similar story the 1066 gigabyte leads
the way while the 3 gigabyte model is
also able to beat both the 4 gigabyte
and a gigabyte versions of the 480
temporal filtering was first used to try
and open black holes but it was
accidentally discovered along the way
that enabling it and watchdogs to
drastically improved performance with no
noticeable impact on image quality to
date no one has told you be soft this
they continue to live it disabled in all
their quality presets for the purpose of
our tests I have gone ahead and enabled
it manually and now the GTX 1060 cards
are able to reach and even exceed 60 fps
this setting also gives the RX 4 a is an
equally large performance boost though
as this is an Nvidia supported title
while the results are as expected
moving the 1440p the three gigabyte 1060
hangs out with its our X 480 buddies
while the six gigabyte version pushes
ahead with 49 fps the power figures
aren't really going to change and it
doesn't make sense to benchmark the AMD
cards using the new Radeon chill feature
as it will make them look considerably
slower than they actually are and idle
the geforce cards consumed around 10
watts less and under load we see quite a
large difference in Nvidia's favour that
said the difference between a total
system consumption of 215 watts and 280
watts is hardly a deal breaker or
anything to really get worried about so
last time I made this comparison it was
a reasonably comfortable wind friend
video and their GTX 1060 it was around
12% faster than the RX 4 80 when we
compared the average data across
something like 25 games still not
willing to go down without a fight
AMD has been working hard to develop
their drivers and it looks like it's
paid off first up let's compare the six
gigabyte 1060 and eight gigabyte 480
more closely here we see that on average
the 1060 is now just 1% faster on
average at 1080p whereas previously we
found it to be 12% faster AMD has been
able to reduce the margin in one of two
ways firstly they've been working hard
on their driver support evident by the
recent Reliv update secondly and
probably more importantly there have
been more AMD sponsored titles released
later in the year
moving a 1440p we find the same 1%
margin one flip and % guys that's margin
of error stuff even with a three run
average it also means Nvidia pulled
ahead in just a single extra title in
video 110 titles to AMD's nine titles
hadn't video not trounced AMD quite as
hard in quantum break that
one percent could have very easily swung
the other way anyway the fact is in
today's games these GPUs really are
neck-and-neck so what about those
rinky-dinky $200 u.s. MSRP cards the
three gigabyte 1060 and the 4 gigabyte
480 how do they compare if only there
was a way we could find out oh wait
well this is mighty convenient isn't it
again AMD and NVIDIA trade blows though
this time the our X 480 comes out on top
albeit by a rather small 2% margin at
1080p doom and hitman are quite big
hitters for AMD while quantum break is
again an Nvidia favorite moving to 1440p
d3 gigabyte 10 six years now four
percent slower hardly a parenting but
the 4 gigabyte R X 480 does provide
better numbers here for the most part
that said margins were very close in the
new and exciting titles such as
battlefield 1 watchdogs to rise the Tomb
Raider and Titan vol 2 for those of you
wondering the GTX 1063 gigabyte averaged
53 FPS at 1440p while the RX 484
gigabyte averaged 56 fps keeping in mind
the quality settings used both seem like
very capable 1440p gaming solutions also
as a side note the power color red
dragon version of the RX 484 gigabyte
card that i have isn't factory
overclocked that's that i didn't really
feel like this was an issue the reason
for this is because MSI's RX 480 gaming
x 8g card which was used to represent
the RX 488 gigabyte only features a 3%
factory core overclock while the memory
goes unchanged so at the very most those
results can only be inflated by up to 3%
the rest can be blamed on the fact that
the 4 gigabyte cards run their gddr5
memory 13% slower still for the most
part the performance was very similar
overall the 8 gigabyte model was just 5%
faster an average across the games
tested now for that time in the video
where I start feeling all that peer
pressure I don't know what to pick don't
shoot the messenger guys seriously
though it really isn't for me to say
which one of these cards you need to
pick it really comes down to nothing
more than pricing in your region looking
to Newegg for you
we're shoppers we find the six gigabyte
1060 selling for around two hundred and
fifty dollars with a few nice options to
pick from the a gigabyte 480 is around
10 dollars cheaper and there are some
nice options from power color gigabyte
and msi selling for two hundred and
forty dollars as we have said time and
time again in the past with these close
comparisons you really could justify
going either way and there's certainly
no wrong option here arguing over which
one of these products you should buy is
the very definition of a waste of time
and while that's putting it nicely down
under here in Australia the choice is a
bit more obvious the cheapest 8 gigabyte
are X 480 costs 380 dollars while the 6
gigabyte 1060 can be picked up quite a
bit cheaper at 350 dollars given the
price difference which admittedly is
still very small I would probably go
with the 1060 but again you could go
either way and I can't imagine anyone
being disappointed with either option
moving to the cheaper versions we find
the 3 gigabyte 1060 selling for around
$200 while the 4 gigabyte 480 is much
the same though power color and MSI are
offering models at $190 given that the 4
gigabyte 480 is slightly faster this is
probably the way I would go and the msi
Armour model looks like a very nice
option at $190 again sadly Aussies are
paying much more for the 4 gigabyte 480
locally most surprised at around 340
dollars while the 3 gigabyte 1060 cards
are selling for 300 dollars and there
are even a few as low as 290 again as an
Aussie shopper this would push me
towards the Green Team that said as I
noted in my unboxing boxer series
earlier this week Australians can
actually get the R X 480 cards cheaper
from the US via Newegg I've got my power
color card used for testing in this
video for under $300 including 43
dollars for shipping it did take two
weeks to get here but it works very well
and the price was great
so in summary with the six gigabyte GTX
1060 and a gigabyte R X 480 neck and
neck I really don't know which way I go
here I guess it depends on how I felt on
the day as for the four gigabyte R X 480
and three about 1060 I think the 4
gigabyte 4
lady gets the nod here for now I'll just
keep benchmarking I hope to add the rx
470 and rx 460 cards to comparison
along with the GTX 1050 series and of
course the big boys in the 1070 and 1080
I might also add the Titan XP I'll see
how I go for time so be sure to hit that
subscribe button to make sure you don't
miss out on that one
well if you make this far good job and I
hope to see you next time bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
