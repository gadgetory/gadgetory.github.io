we're checking out view Sonic's latest
ultrawide monitor the focus is solely on
the gaming market
it's the x3 350 R dash C a 35 inch 34 40
by 1440 MVA display with a maximum
refresh rate of 100 Hertz and 1800 R
curvature and free sync every tales for
around seven hundred US dollars or nine
hundred and sixty Aussie so it's a
little on the expensive side but we'll
see how performs and whether it stacks
up to other popular monitors in this
category aside from the specs I just
mentioned viewsonic have included
several other gamer features including
RGB lighting something viewsonic calls
clear motion which is basically back low
strobing and black stabilization this is
combined with low input lag and very
basic support for HDR 10 content however
when I took this monitor out of the box
I wasn't overly impressed with the
design it's a chunky monitor not just in
terms of the display unit itself but
also when it comes to bezels a lot of
monitors these days are moving to
slimmer designs but it seems blue Sonic
kinda hasn't got the message here
because it's bigger than even my Acer
predator X 34 which was released back in
2015 the base as well is pretty massive
I know some people prefer these designs
to the wide three-prong stands but this
thing really takes up a lot of room on a
desk the good news is that this has led
to an adjustable stand with all the
swivel tilt and height adjustability on
your more budget offerings it's rare to
get height adjustments so this is a
welcome inclusion and viewsonic does it
well with this sturdy construction on
the rear we're definitely moving into
gamer territory here with the RGB LED
lighting and some gamer patterns this
isn't as egregious as say and a soos ROG
design but it also lacks that sleek and
subtle aesthetic that I personally enjoy
there's also LED lighting in the base of
the stand which shines towards the front
a headphone rest that pops out of the
stand on the back is included as well
the build quality is also rather
unimpressive I wouldn't say it's bad but
the heavy use of stock standard black
plastic doesn't exactly give the extra
350 yards se a pre
look when you combine this with the
general chunkiness you'd be more
inclined to suggest it was a budget
display rather than something priced
near $700 the array of ports is good two
HDMI 2.0 a DisplayPort input a basic
three port USB hub and a 3.5 mm audio
jack you do get internal speakers
they're not the worst I've heard but I
can't imagine gamers using them for
their in-game audio the on-screen
display is both good and bad
I like the inclusion of a directional
toggle but viewsonic has still somehow
made it difficult to navigate by
continually switching which buttons
perform which actions depending on the
area of the menu you are in bit of a
nitpick but I found it annoying on top
of that the menus color scheme is very
difficult to read on certain backgrounds
I haven't found myself needing to put a
white window behind the menu just so I
could see what was going on however
there are some useful features in here
Clear Motion View Sonic's brand name for
backlight strobing or a black frame
insertion provides additional clarity to
motion in some gaming environments I'm
personally not a fan as the backlight
brightness drops and you can't use it
alongside fruit sync but some people
love this sort of feature there's also a
wide variety of game modes color
settings and so on I was a bit surprised
at the lack of cheat crosshairs though
given how ubiquitous that feature is
among other brands one thing I should
mention is my unit shipped with two dead
pixels in the far bottom-right corner in
close proximity to each other this does
happen from time to time it's not really
something everyone will experience I
think I was just unlucky here with my
unit let's quickly talk about the
refresh rate here before we move into
other performance metrics this is a 34
40 by 1440 panel at 100 Hertz which I
think still qualifies as high refresh
these days despite the availability of
144 and even 200 Hertz at this
resolution it's a smoother experience
than 60 Hertz the step up to 144 Hertz
isn't noticeable but I feel for a lot of
gamers especially those who don't have a
high end GPU this refresh rate is very
nice
the resolution is 1440p class which I
feel is perfect for gaming and
productivity tasks and the 21:9 aspect
ratio adds that bit of immersion to your
gameplay as someone that games on an
ultra wide I definitely recommend it
viewsonic is providing adaptive sync
with low framerate compensation here
which is great to see it works perfectly
on both AMD and NVIDIA GPUs as well so
no
here and certainly no issues with
flickering 1440p ultra-wide high refresh
monitors have matured a lot in recent
years to the point where even VA
offerings have decent response times in
contrast to some non ultra wide displays
with similar specs using the ultra fast
overdrive setting I recorded a greater
great average response time of 5.1 3
milliseconds which as you can see is one
of the fastest va response time averages
I've measured typically for a 16:9
monitor these panel sent around seven to
nine milliseconds but for some reason
these ultra whines are just a lot faster
the xg3 50-yard dash seeds around 0.7
milliseconds faster than the 34 inch v8
equivalent of this panel you can see in
budget offerings like Kogan's 34 Ultra 1
the difference here being 34 inch panels
are manufactured by Samsung whereas a
you Optronics makes the 35 inch models
this viewsonic monitor is also a little
faster than the best LG IPS panels have
to offer with this resolution as seen in
the LG 34 GK 950 F and it's six point
one millisecond transition time still
there's a bit of a costume that 5 to 6
millisecond bracket with not much
difference between H option in terms of
input lag again a decent result here for
the x-33 50-yard dash C with under 4
milliseconds of latency which is within
the usual bracket of gaming monitors the
34 GK 950 F is the fastest ultra wide
I've tested at 2.4 milliseconds of
latency but we're talking about a one
millisecond difference here nothing to
get excited about brightness is good 313
it's out of the box is going to be too
bright for most users and without any
real HDR support there's nothing to be
concerned about the contrast ratio
however is a weak spot for a you
Optronics ultra-high panel it's is it
just nineteen hundred to one for the XG
350 yards see compared to around three
thousand to one four monitors that use
the Samsung panel let's move in now to
take a look at color performance the
x-33 50-yard dash C is a standard gamut
monitor the focuses on srgb
in my testing it exceeds the srgb
spectrum slightly but not by enough to
be DCI p3 compliant none of this matters
srgb is most important for PC usage
today whether that's gaming or
application use out of the box this
monitor is surprisingly decent in terms
of its calibration a white point of 65
54 K is excellent and if it weren't for
a bit of inaccuracy in the darker area
of
gamma curve we'd be looking at a sub 2.0
Delta average when viewing saturation
performance we do hit that sub 2.0 Delta
average which is great and helps
massively by the accurate white point
and then we also get a better than
average result when viewing colorchecker
numbers considering most gaming grade
monitors ship with very little
calibration to speak of I'm pleased to
see near accurate results from the
viewsonic XG 3 50-yard dash seat out of
the box with a few small tweaks and
changes to the color controls in the
on-screen display I was able to tighten
things up further with sub 2.0 Delta
averages across the board which is a
very strong showing and of course we can
go one step further with a full
calibration the results of which you can
see here patreon members can download
the ICC profile icon for this monitor if
you want to experiment with it although
juda panel variants in work create
accurate results for all owners while
this monitor does deliver a relatively
strong color results excellent response
times and good input lag there is one
aspect that really let sit down and
that's the panel coding this isn't
something I normally talk about in
reviews because it's not usually an
issue but with the x-33 50-yard dash C I
immediately spotted something strange
about the way this monitor displays text
it's a subtle effect but this monitor
seems to have a bit of smudge yunus to
it
tex lacks the sharpness and clarity of
other 34:40 by 1440 monitors i've
recently reviewed and when viewing the
display through a magnifying glass i put
this down to something strange about the
coding that's diffusing the light
slightly which is creating this smudge
issue the subtle lack of sharpness is
almost like the monitor is running and a
sub native resolution except it's
actually working as intended it's a
really weird one because again the
screen coding isn't something I normally
have any issues with but on this problem
alone I'd always find it hard to
recommend this monitor when similar
options exist that give greater clarity
moving on to uniformity again these are
pretty good results for an ultra wide
we're getting typical fall-off along the
outer edges but the central zone is
reasonably accurate definitely more so
than some curved ultra whites I've
tested with all the testing done the
data in and the comparisons made I think
the viewsonic XG 3 50-yard dash C is one
of the rare monitors that I can't really
recommend and this isn't just from a
value or price perspective the monitor
is expensive and I'll talk about that
shortly
it's
from a technical standpoint there are
just a few too many issues here for a
monitor in a category that's mature and
filled with options to me there are four
key problems the smudgy screen coding is
a rare issue but an annoying one that
reduces the clarity for an otherwise
decently high resolution power the
design is bulky not all that appealing
and built from unimpressive materials
the on screen menu is flawed in both its
navigation and color scheme which makes
it very difficult to use and the
contrast ratio is lower than equivalent
monitors they're not for samsung's VI
panel / AU Optronics there are some
positives here response time and input
lag performance is great it's not
outstandingly better than equivalent
monitors but it's still very good out of
the box color performance is better than
I expected and better than average and
it does come with features like a height
adjustable stand back light strobing
modes and RGB lighting but unfortunately
the cons are compounded by a price tag
that's far too high in today's market at
$700 a 3440 by 1440 ultra-wide really
needs to be offering a higher refresh
rate than just a hundred Hertz to
justify that price tag it's only $100
more to get the Acer predator X 30 for P
or LG 34 GK 950 G both are all-round
better monitors with a 120 Hertz refresh
rate and full chasing support of course
not everyone can afford the extra
hundred dollars which is why for
budget-conscious 34 40 by 1440 buys I
point to the more entry-level offerings
in this category sure monitors such as
the $450 via tech G + 34 c or M si ma G
341 CQ don't offer features like a
height adjustable stand or backlight
strobing but there is no way those
features are worth spending an extra
$250 on to make matters worse these
cheaper options actually deliver better
picture quality response time and input
lag results are similar but the contrast
from Samsung's cheaper VI panel is
higher and you don't get the weird
coding issue that this viewsonic monitor
has I also find the price quite strange
to be honest here in Australia viewsonic
also sell the VX 3515 to KPC hdw a
monitor with a mouthful of a name but
one that offers a 34 40 by 1440
resolution and 100 hertz refresh rate
for just 500 Aussie dollars it
Pete strongly with similar options like
the vo-tech and MSM owners I just
mentioned and it's one I'd be
considering if it's available in your
region yeah with this very monitor on
the market viewsonic decided to sell
their new ultra wide at $1,100 locally
with current discounts bringing that
down to around nine hundred and sixty
dollars that's around double the price
which just seems insane to me when the
key differences are a few gamers
specific features and a better stand
really not sure what viewsonic we're
thinking so those are my thoughts
unfortunately this display just isn't a
great value proposition and has a few
too many flaws for my liking that other
viewsonic monitor I mentioned is great
value and his worth checking out as are
the vo-tech in MSI models alternatively
some of the higher-end ultra wives with
better refresh rates I think going in
either of those directions is a better
idea right now
