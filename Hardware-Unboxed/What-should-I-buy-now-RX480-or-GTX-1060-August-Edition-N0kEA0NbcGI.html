answer the question so many of you been
asking me what should I buy the RX 480
of the gtx 1060 having looked online
locally and at US retailers i was faced
with the grim realization that
availability was extremely poor for both
products despite being out in the wild
for an entire month the RX 4 ad was
virtually nowhere to be seen and almost
by default the gtx 1060 was crowned the
victor the best price i could find at
the time was 440 ozzy dollars for the
reference version RX 488 gigabyte model
meanwhile for the same price i found
some nice aftermarket gtx 1060 examples
from a soos and galaxy so the choice was
pretty obvious
despite this hard evidence many
red-blooded AMD fans - - the dislike
button in protest some even claimed it
was stupid to compare these cards at the
time and suggested waiting a few weeks
of course the idea of that video is to
answer the question what should I buy
right now anyway we find ourselves three
weeks down the track so what's changed
sadly not a whole lot in fact if
anything things have become even more
grim for those hopeful rx 480 and gtx
1060 owners it won't be long in the AR x
480 will it being available and i do use
that term loosely for two months
meanwhile the gtx 1060 has been
strutting its mid-range stuff for
exactly one month now today availability
for both products sucks there and as I
found three weeks ago availability of
the RX 4 ad sucks just that little bit
more down under the cheapest RX 4 ad I
could find in stock was from net plus
for $400 and of course it's a nasty
reference card meanwhile you might has a
rather unappealing blower style gtx 1060
model from a Suisun stop for 415 dollars
neither option is particularly
attractive but if I was forced to pick
one right now and again go with the gtx
1060 if i wasn't forced to pick right
now i'd certainly try and wait it out or
look for a previous generation AMD or
nvidia graphics card on the cheap the
situation stateside is just as bleak the
RX 480 is again only available in
reference form and major online
retailers such as Newegg lists just a
single card and stop for crazy 330 US
dollars the good news here being that
the impressive
GTX 1060 windforce model which I
reviewed here can be had for just $250
there's also a decent-looking a sous
version for 290 dollars though the much
cheaper gigabyte model is the obvious
choice
the Asus model can be purchased by
Australians from new egg though the bill
comes to 480 dollars so that's not
really a feasible option meanwhile not a
single rx4 ad can be purchased off new
egg for those down under availability
for this new current generation and
mid-range graphics cards really is
disappointing
I never expected yields to be great
after such a long period on the 28
nanometer process but this is more
ridiculous than I could have ever
imagined oddly there are a number of rx
470 graphics cards to choose from and I
Suz has the great looking Strix model
that I tested here for just 190 bucks
that said most rx 470 partner card
models were out of stock in the US and
Australia so don't expect those asu's
cards selling near the MSRP to last long
so other than waited out what should you
do I personally would forget about the
rx 480 in GTX 1060 and not for the
Radeon r9 390x instead the 390 X is
arguably a superior product and right
now it can be purchased for as little as
$400 from a number of retailers the
us-based shoppers new egg is flogging
the 390x off for as little as 340 bucks
for a nice-looking XFX model so in short
the answer to what should I buy right
now the RX 480 or gtx 1060 is the Radeon
r9 390x strange huh thanks for tuning in
again
