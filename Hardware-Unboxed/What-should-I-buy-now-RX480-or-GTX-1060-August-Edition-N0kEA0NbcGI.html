answer the question so many of you been
asking me what should i buy the RX 480
of the GTX 1060 having looked online
locally and at us retailers I was faced
with the grim realization that
availability was extremely poor for both
products despite being out in the wild
for an entire month the RX 480 was
virtually nowhere to be seen and almost
by default the GTX 1060 was crowned the
victor the best price I could find at
the time was 440 Ozzie dollars for the
reference version RX 488 gigabyte model
meanwhile for the same price i found
some nice aftermarket gtx 1060 examples
from a sous and GALEX so the choice was
pretty obvious despite this hard
evidence many red-blooded AMD fans to to
the dislike button in protest some even
claimed it was stupid to compare these
cards at the time and suggested waiting
a few weeks of course the idea of that
video is to answer the question what
should I buy right now anyway we find
ourselves three weeks down the track so
what's changed sadly not a whole lot in
fact if anything things have become even
more grim for those hopeful our X 480
and GTX 1060 owners it won't be long in
the RX for ad will it be available and I
do use that term loosely for two months
meanwhile the GTX 1060 has been
strutting its mid-range stuff for
exactly one month now today availability
for both products sucks though and as I
found three weeks ago availability of
the RX 480 sucks just that little bit
more down under the cheapest RX for
Eddie I could find in stock was from net
plus for four hundred dollars and of
course it's a nasty reference card
meanwhile you matt has a rather
unappealing blower style GTX 1060 model
from a Susan stop for four hundred and
fifteen dollars neither option is
particularly attractive but if I was
forced to pick one right now and again
go with the gtx 1060 if I wasn't forced
to pick right now I'd certainly try and
wait it out or look for a previous
generation AMD or nvidia graphics card
on the cheap the situation stateside is
just as bleak the RX 480 is again only
available in reference form and major
online retailers such as newegg list
just a single card and stop for crazy
330 US dollars the good news here being
that the impressive gigabyte GT
1060 windforce model which i reviewed
here can be had for just two hundred and
fifty dollars there's also a
decent-looking a sous version for two
hundred ninety dollars though the much
cheaper gigabyte model is the obvious
choice the asus model can be purchased
by australians from newegg though the
bill comes to four hundred and eighty
dollars so that's not really a feasible
option meanwhile not a single r x 480
can be purchased off newegg for those
down under availability for these new
current generation and mid-range
graphics cards really is disappointing I
never expected yields to be great after
such a long period on the 28 nanometer
process but this is more ridiculous and
I could have ever imagined oddly there
are a number of RX 470 graphics cards to
choose from in ASU's has the
great-looking Strix model that I tested
here for just one hundred and ninety
bucks that said most RX 470 partner cab
models were out of stock in the US and
Australia so don't expect those asu's
cards telling near the MSRP to last long
so other than wait it out what should
you do I personally would forget about
the RX for 18 gtx 1060 and not for the
radeon r9 390 x instead the 390 x is
arguably a superior product and right
now it can be purchased for as little as
four hundred dollars from a number of
retailers the us-based shoppers newegg
is flogging the 390 x off for as little
as three hundred and forty bucks for a
nice-looking XFX model so in short the
answer to what should i buy right now
the RX for 80 or gtx 1060 is the radeon
r9 390 X strange huh thanks for tuning
