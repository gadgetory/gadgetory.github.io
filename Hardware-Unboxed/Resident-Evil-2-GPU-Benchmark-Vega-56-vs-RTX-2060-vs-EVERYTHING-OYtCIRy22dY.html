time for another mega benchmark session
and the victim of today's GPU onslaught
is Resident Evil 2 it's a survival
horror game developed and published by
Capcom it's also a remake of the
original Resident Evil 2 which was
released for the PlayStation way back in
1998 for those of you wondering the
game's built upon Capcom's re engine
this game engine was initially built for
Resident Evil 7 biohazard but has since
been used for Devil May Cry 5 fun fact
the re is the first two letters of the
game engines full name reach for the
moon told it was a fun fact prior to the
introduction of the re engine Resident
Evil titles use the MT framework engine
and this includes 2012 Resident Evil 6
the re engine is much improved it offers
a variety of new graphical enhancements
such as dynamic shadows shadow cache
subsurface scatters and FXAA + taa there
also a few updated rendering techniques
such as HDR AVR specific mode the
ability to output at a 4k resolution and
more anyway I think it's time we get to
it so let's get the important stuff out
of the way I'm not here to tell you
about the game's history anything about
the story or how it plays and this
certainly isn't to be treated as a
review what I am here to do is show you
how a massive range of graphics cards
perform in this title so you know what
you'll need for playable performance at
1080p 1440p and 4k using the maximum in
game quality preset I've also done some
additional testing with the sort of
mid-range type quality preset at 1080p
to see what you can get away with also
please note that the game does support
both DirectX 11 and 12 but I've used the
older DirectX 11 API for all the testing
because as usual DirectX 12 is a
complete and utter mess it's plagued by
low framerate and constant stuttering
the modern GeForce r-tx graphics cards
along with aim DS Vega models were both
over 30% faster when using DirectX 11
for testing
according a 60-second pass within the
police station from the initial
checkpoint once you do reach the police
station so from that checkpoint I walk
up the left staircase and then back down
the opposite side and then under the
roller door and this takes us to a
cutscene and the test ends about halfway
through that cutscene for the bulk of
the testing the max preset has been used
and it recommends 14 gigabytes of vram
or I think it's 13.7 but I've written
down 14 anyway it's a lot of VRAM as the
point don't seem have been insane and
it's a tad exaggerated based on what I
saw the arch x20 atti
that really only saw men or vram
allocation peak at around 8 gigabytes it
was usually around seven seven and a
half but at times got up to around eight
gigabytes now this was when gaming at
the 4k resolution that's still a lot of
VRAM to be allocated even when compared
to newer titles but it's not quite
fourteen gigabytes
then using the balanced profile which is
sort of like a medium type preset I
suppose I retested some of the newer
graphics cards along with some of the
much older models and this particular
preset suggests the VRAM usage will hit
2.4 gigabytes which is much more
manageable for the Lauren cards as for
the drivers I've tested with AMD's new
adrenaline 2019 Edition 19 point 1.2
driver and this driver is optimized for
Resident Evil 2 and then for Nvidia's
GeForce graphics cards we have game
ready for 17.7 t1 ok I think that's
about everything let's get into the
results starting with the 1080p results
here we have all the current and
previous generation GPUs actually we
technically have three generations from
your video now but anyway my point is we
have a whole lot of squashed blue bar
graphs here so let's stretch them out
and discuss the results as we scroll
down to the dreaded unplayable zone even
with the maximum quality preset enabled
the r-tx 2082 I blitz this test spitting
at an incredible 217 fps the Pascal
neck's GTX 1080i and RT x28 all provided
very similar results needless to say
they enabled extremly playable
performance then we see a reasonably
large step down to the arch X 2070 in
Vega 64 at least when looking at the
average frame rate and it should be
noted that Vega 56 does incredibly well
here beating not only the GTX 1080 but
also the new RT X 2060 it didn't slip
behind ever so slightly for the 0.1% low
result but it wasn't ahead for the 1%
low and average frame rate in fact from
this point down AMD does very well the
RX 590 was basically able to match the
gtx 1070 you don't see that too often
and this placed it on par with the gtx
980ti then we see the RX 580 smashing
the gtx 1066 gigabyte by a convincing
26% margin basically placing them a
category apart in this title that said
it wasn't all great news for AMD their
previous generation fury range didn't
fare so well and this is down to the
limited 4 gigabyte vm buffer basically
they are unplayable that said it was
interesting to see the 4 gigabyte
versions of the RX 580 and 570 faring
much better I'm putting this down to
memory optimizations for the GC and 4th
gen architecture there moving further
down we see the GTX 980 6 gigabyte 1060
and a Radeon r9 390 all producing
similar performance at around 70 FPS
then to my surprise the 3 gigabyte 1060
was able to provide play performance
given its very limited vram buffer size
and in particular given what we saw for
the 4 gear by AMD cards I was expecting
a PowerPoint presentation here but it
was playable sure the point 1 percent
low performance did suffer but the
experience wasn't overly choppy there
was a noticeable frame stuttering but it
wasn't super frequent and a similar
experience was also seen with the GTX
970 but once we drop below that
performance really does start to suffer
increasing the resolution of 1440 pcs
quite a few of the more modern GPU start
to fall below the 60fps barrier with
many of the budget entry-level models
simply too slow to test so we've dropped
them
Ty Lee as expected the r-tx 20 atti has
no issues at 1440p and the same is true
for the non TI model as well along with
the GT x 1080 Ti and Titan X it's also
interesting to note that the GTX 1082 a
slightly larger vram buffer I didn't
give it an advantage over the RT X 2080
despite the game allocating around seven
to seven and a half gigabytes of memory
basically placed in the 2080 right on
the edge here that said we can only
monitor memory allocation and while the
game was often allocating more than six
gigabytes of memory the RT X 2060 had no
issues keeping up and as was the case at
turn AP remain just 11% slower than the
2070 at 1440p AMD's Vega GPUs again do
very well Vegas 64 hung in there with
the RT x 2070 while Vega 56 beat out the
GTX 1080 and RT X 2060 at least for the
average frame rate again the frame time
performance was slightly down but
nothing too alarming then we have the RX
590 it was again able to keep pace with
the gtx 1070 while the RX 580 was 26%
faster the gtx 1066 gigabyte AMD Zolder
fury range continued to struggle due to
its limited four gigabyte vm buffer not
surprising given what we saw at 1080p
though once again the GC and fourth gen
malts with only four gigabytes of memory
did fare better the GTX 1066 gigabyte
was right on the edge for playable
performance and here the older Maxwell
GPUs the GTX 980 and 970 were really
unable to deliver playable performance
at 1440p then finally at the 4k
resolution we have very few survivors
the RT X 28 et I was of course capable
of providing smooth playable performance
and what we got from the RT X 20 80 GTX
1080i and Titan X was also very nice the
RT X 20 70 and Vega 64 weren't really
fast enough I think if you're going to
spend that much money on a graphics card
you'd expect a better performance than
what you were seeing here at 4k though
of course you could reduce a few quality
settings and probably get them up to an
acceptable level beyond that though
you're better off at 1440p wrapping up
the testing I grabbed a few of the
mid-range graphics cards as well as some
old bangers loaded up what's called the
balanced
preset at 1080p and ran the tests again
this boosted the performance of the RX
570 by almost 30% that said the RX 570
did quite well with the maximum quality
preset despite only having a full
gigabyte vm buffer whether truly huge
gains were seen was with the 2 to 3
gigabyte cards take the gtx 1050 for
example it saw over an 80% performance
boost with the balance preset enabled
this preset suggests 2 point 4 gigabytes
of vram will be used though again that
seems to be a slightly aggressive
estimate as the 2 gigabyte models work
just fine for 60fps an average something
like the Radeon HD 7950 will do just
fine though from Nvidia you will require
something that's considered quite a bit
more high-end in their product stack I
guess take the GTX 780 Ti for example or
the GTX 970 generally those two would be
considered much more powerful and the
Radeon HD 7950 but not in Resident Evil
2 using the balanced quality preset at
1080p still we did see that older models
or older more lower end models such as
the r9 270x or gtx 960 did enable a
playable experience at 1080p using this
preset so not a bad deal there really
before I forget there were a few issues
with the GeForce 600 and 700 series
models so any cards based on the Kepler
architecture I say Kepler based GPUs
because the gtx 750ti worked without any
issues and it's the only GeForce 700
series model not to use that
architecture instead it's a Maxwell
based GPU there's also the standard 750
which I don't test within an OEM model
the 7:45 there are also Maxwell parts
but I don't test with those anyway well
the game did load up with a Kepler based
GP installed the game was very dark
basically unplayable seems to be an
issue with the lighting and this is
obviously a driver issue
I'm sure if GeForce 600 and 700 owners
make enough noise about this in video
will address the bug performance did
also seem to be a bit lower than
expected for those models so please note
that there is a lightning bug with those
GPUs and a driver fix should improve
performance and especially the visuals
but it could possibly reduce it a little
bit as well so we'll just have to wait
and see on that one but I have to
imagine there is quite a lot of
performance Headroom here that can be
untapped through some driver
optimization
okay so wrapping things up for those of
you targeting 1080p gameplay with all
the bells and whistles you want to grab
this cab with at least four gigabytes of
memory that's really the absolute bare
minimum ideally you will want six
gigabytes or more of VRAM and so from
the newer generations you'll want
something like a six gigabyte gtx 1060
that you could get away with the GTX 980
from the previous generation and from
AMD the RX 570 or r9 390 they worked
quite well and as is often the case with
the rx 570 it does represent exceptional
value but for the max preset you
probably want to ensure that you get the
a gigabyte version and well that being
the case you might as well just get an
achy about rx 580 the 8 gigabyte rx 580
really was the pound-for-pound champ at
1080p for those gaming at 1440p there
are a few good options Vega 56 is
certainly one of them as is the new r-tx
2060 that said if you've got a Pascal GT
X 1080 1070 TI over the 1070 then you'll
have no issues playing rather than evil
- at 1440p as for 4k well no surprises
here you'll ideally want an r/t X 20
atti but if you're not drowning in coin
then a gtx 1080i RR TX 2080 will get the
job done of course as I mentioned
previously you can tweak the quality
settings for better performance and
tomorrow my trusty sidekick will be
doing just that as Tim players to test
out every single quality setting using a
few different GPUs so that'll certainly
be worth checking out over all Resident
Evil 2 looks great in fact it really
looks quite amazing at least from what
I've seen so far and if your interests
of ival horror games then I'm pretty
confident you'll enjoy this one the
steam store reviews are also
overwhelmingly positive so it looks like
we have one of those rare titles that
actually delivers I'll certainly be
adding this one to our full time roster
of games that we benchmark with and it
even looks like it might be a decent CPU
benchmark as well though I would like to
play through the game a bit
more to see where those demanding
sections are if you've come across any
feel free to let me know about them in
the comment section below that is always
much appreciated and that is going to do
it for this 57 GPU benchmark if you did
