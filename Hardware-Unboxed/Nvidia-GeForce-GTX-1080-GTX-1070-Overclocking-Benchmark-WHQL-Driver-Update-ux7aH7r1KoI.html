how we're unboxed and with an update of
my 1080 and 1070 videos using the new WH
QL drivers I've also taken the time to
update the overclocked results as well
for this video we had to use a
pre-release version of EVGA precision X
overclocking utility this allowed us to
overclock the core memory while also
maxing out the power and temperature
targets for overclocking the 1080 and
1070 the power target and temp target
sliders were dragged all the way to the
right which saw the power target reach
120 percent and the temp table reach 92
percent after some messing about with
the 1080 we arrived at a 240 megahertz
boost for the core and 750 megahertz for
the memory this resulted in a base clock
frequency of 1847 megahertz which I was
expecting to result in a boost core
clock speed a 1973 megahertz for the
1070 I was able to boost the core by 220
megahertz and the memory by just 150
megahertz
meaning we were running at a base clock
frequency of 1726 megahertz and boost
core speeds and games of 1903 megahertz
for comparison we've overclocked a
refference versions of the 1979-80 and
980ti to their maximum stable
frequencies first up let's take a look
at the recently released doom title here
the GTX 1080 increased its performance
by a decent 18 percent to 148 fps the
1070 on the other hand jump from 96 to
109 FPS which worked out to be only a
14% game here the 980 TI was able to
produce a much larger gaming performance
from its own larger overclock improving
from 90 FPS to 114 fps a 27% improvement
now let's see how the cards overclocked
in battlefield 4 the 980 TI was again a
much better overclocking here netting an
extra 26% performance the 1070 on the
other hand gained just temps and
performance and the 1080 was good for
just 11% more although the game was
extremly playable with all cards tested
and the 1080 did manage a monstrous 122
FPS when overclocked next up is ARMA 3
and here the new generation of GPUs
weren't able to gain much by
overclocking due to a CPU utilization
bottleneck in the game the 1070 games 5
frames per second and the 1080 game just
for the 980 see I did manage 15% more
performance through the next
9 frames per second in this game in the
division overclocking performance is
back around where I'd expect it to be
the 1070 and 1080 both gain 9 FPS or 15
and 12% more frames respectively the
980ti was also able to get up over 60
FPS boosting a certain performance by
21% to average 70 FPS star wars
battlefront showed a pretty level
overclocking field where the 1070 gained
12% performance the 1080 gain 10%
performance and the 980ti I gained 14%
performance this is a game where old
cards are able to maintain very high
minimums to Just Cause 3 it was another
game that didn't show huge gains through
overclocking although there was still
significant the 10 series cards both
needed 9% more performance for
themselves and the 98 ti I was again
good for 14% the overclocked 1070 was as
per usual a few frames ahead of the
overclocked 980 TI in our last game
tested Far Cry primal the overclocked
cards were again able to gain a handy
little performance boost the 1070 gains
7 fps or 11% the 1080 gained 8 frames
for 10% and the 980 TI was able to gain
9 FPS for a 16% game so as found
previously the 1070 and 1080 founders
edition graphics cards were on average
11% faster once overclocked compared to
the 980 TI which receives roughly a 20%
performance boost through overclocking
the founders edition graphics cards are
a bit disappointing I'm definitely
excited to see what kind of overclocking
performance numbers the board partner
cars are able to extract especially the
liquid cooled options in which I'm sure
there'll be many I plan on reviewing
gigabytes GD X 1080 g1 gaming next
week's to keep an eye out for that one
in particular I'm also gonna have AMD's
polaris card soon so if you haven't yet
jump on the bandwagon and hit subscribe
I'm your host Matt as always and I'll
see you guys next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
