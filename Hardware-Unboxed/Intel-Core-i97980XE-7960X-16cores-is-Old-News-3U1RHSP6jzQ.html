finally have the missing pieces of the
sky like x-series after hastily
announcing the 18 core part back in late
May during the Computex 2017 trade show
we now have it in hand four months later
I don't doubt that Intel always plan to
release the sky like x-series this year
but did they plan to offer say higher
than a 12 core part before they caught
wind of ambe's thread Ripper it also
seems unlikely that they plan to
announce the x-gen ion platform in late
May and then release at the following
month and this was evident by the
heavily rush to motherboard development
and just the mess that ensued so in late
June we got the first core iron iron
part the 10 core 70 100x along with a
few core i7 models offering 86 and even
for cos the 70 100x is a $1000 part but
we knew there was also going to be a
$1200 12 core $1,400 14 core $1700 16
core and a $2,000 18 core in early
August Intel announced the official
specifications for the higher core count
parts and we learned that the 18 core
and 16 core models would feature fairly
low base clocks though this was to be
expected before we cover the i9 79 80 XC
and 79 60 X in detail it's certainly
well worth mentioning that during all
the chaos of Intel's latest desktop
platform release AMD released their rise
and thread Ripper series on August 10th
the thread Ripper 1950 X in 1920 X
arrived and with that we received a
$1000 16 core CPU that shamed Intel's
then flagship 7900 X of course as we're
about to see there was more to come from
Intel but even so at the time we
questioned if a $1200 12 course 79 20 X
could even match let alone beat the 1950
X and we suspected that would probably
take the $1400 14 core 79 40 X to match
AMD 16 core CPU well unfortunately we
don't have the 12 call all the 14 core
models to find out instead intel served
up the ultra expensive 16 and 18 core
model
for this review that said though this
will give us a very good idea of whether
twelve and fourteen core version will
slot in and of course we're always keen
to see what the flagship parts have to
offer so to quickly recap the core I 979
80 XE packs
18 cores and with a type of hurting
support offers and insane
36 threads each core has its own 1
megabyte level 2 cache and this means
there's a total of 18 megabytes of cache
meanwhile there's also 24.7 5 megabytes
worth of l3 cache and due to the
restructuring of the cache for the sky
like ex architecture the 79-80 XE only
has slightly more l3 than the previous
generation 69 50 X the 79 80 XE operates
at a base frequency of 2.6 gigahertz
with a Turbo Boost 2.0 frequency of 4.2
gigahertz and a turbo boost max 3.0
frequency of 4.4 gigahertz the 16 core
79 60 X features a base clock speed of
2.8 yoghurts with the same turbo boost
frequencies it also has a slightly
smaller 22 megabyte l3 cache well
there's a total of 16 megabytes for the
l2 both CPUs offer the full 44 PCIe
lanes quad channel memory support and a
165 watt TDP rating though that routing
pretty much means nothing at this point
both CPUs use the LGA 2066 socket and
are supported by existing X 299
motherboards for testing I'm using the
gigabyte Oris X 299 gaming 9 with 32
gigabytes of g.skill stridency RGB ddr4
memory clocked at 1600 megahertz so ddr4
3200 using cell 14 timings the GTX 1082
I was used for all the testing while
we've thrown vega 64 liquid-cooled in
for a few of the game tests the focus
though will of course be on productivity
testing this is where the a-tingle and
16 core CPUs make the most sense after
all all right so let's get into the
benchmarks first up let's check out the
memory bandwidth performance these ddr4
quad-channel memory controllers look to
be good for around 62 to 64 gigabytes
per second of memory bandwidth using
ddr4 3200 memory please note all
configurations were tested using the
same a ddr4 3200 CL 14 memory Cinebench
r15 s multi-threaded test gives us a
very good idea of how the productivity
tests are going to look
assuming that all cores can be fully
utilized here we see the 79 60 X is just
4% faster than the 1950 X for the
multi-threaded workload both are of
course 16 core parts the 79 80 XE is 10%
faster than the 1950 X with an
impressive score of 3317 points though
it does cost twice as much at $2,000 and
we'll certainly discuss that more
towards the end of the review of course
when it comes to single thread
performance the higher clock sky like X
parts are able to best thread Ripper
before we move on to some more serious
benchmarks I just wanted to see how
these extreme CPU stand up in PC mark 10
which looks at office type workloads
which aren't typically call heavy to my
surprise thread Ripper did score very
well in this test and did considerably
better than the sky X CPUs for example
the 79-80 XE looked particularly weak
here of course though none of these CPUs
are by any means slow for these general
office type tasks so it's somewhat
irrelevant excel is an office type
benchmark though which can utilize many
threads especially when running the
extreme Monte Carlo simulation here the
thread Rupa 1950 XR really impressed
taking just one point 66 seconds however
the 16 and 18 course Kollek X parts go
one better as they dip down into the 1.4
second range allowing the 18 core part
to complete the workload 14% faster next
up we have veracrypt
for those of you unaware veracrypt is an
open source utility used for on-the-fly
encryption and features optimized
implementations of cryptographic hash
functions and ciphers which do boost
performance of modern CPUs it also
supports paralyzed encryption for better
multi-core systems as well as harbours
accelerated aes to further improve
performance in short it takes full
advantage of the many cores these CPUs
have on offer and we see that here that
said though the thread Ripper 1950 X did
provide the best results and even the
79-80 XE couldn't beat it so this is a
very disappointing result for Intel next
that we have some non encrypted
compression and decompression
performance using 7-zip
whereas hyper threading sees a similar
level of efficiency when compressing and
decompressing SMT is significantly more
efficient for decompression work for the
decompression worker thread rippin 1950
X is again able to edge out the 79
XE though it was much slower for the
compression test so if you do a lot of
compression work then it looks like the
Intel hike or count CPUs are king here
handbrake is a popular application for
video encoding and we've used it to
convert this 4k h.264 video to 1080p
using h.265 and recorded the average
frame rate here the 79 60 X 80 managed
22 point 3 FPS while the 79 60 X was
actually 8 percent faster the reason for
this is down to utilization handbrake
really only utilized about 70 percent of
the 18 core CPU and because the 79 80 XE
has a lower operating frequency the 79
60 X actually came out on top for me the
Premiere Pro CC results are of the most
interest as a program I use on a regular
basis and for the moment I'm rendering
4k videos on my core i7 69 50x editing
machine I do plan to upgrade to thread
Ripper soon but I have to say the 79 80
XE and 79 60 export times are enticing
that said that will be interesting to
see how many people can justify spending
70 percent more on the 79 60 X to shave
off around 13% from the incurred time
it's also worth noting that once again
the 16 called 79 60 X was faster than
the 79 80 XE due to the fact that
premiere isn't able to fully utilize the
18 core CPU moving on to the rendering
tests we have blender and for this first
test we are using the rising graphic 27
benchmark here the 79 80 XE and the 79
60 X both deliver similar results taking
about 12 seconds each and this meant at
best they were 10% fast in the thread
Ripper 1950 X the gooseberry workload
takes some serious firepower to complete
in around half an hour and we see this
as the 1950 X turns in a time of almost
32 minutes that said though the 79 80 XE
and the 79 60 X were mighty impressive
here taking around 23 minutes once again
the 16 core 79 60 X did it paste the 18
course 79 80 XE the 16 core part was a
whopping 27 percent faster than the 1950
X for this extreme blender workload so
that was impressive to see Corona comes
as a standalone benchmark it renders a
fixed scene six times and we take the
time it takes to complete the entire
task this application apps will
loves threads the more the merrier and
the quicker you'll be done you can move
on to something else here the 79 60 X
was 14% fast in the 1950 X while the 79
80 XE was 20% faster now this is one of
the better results we've seen for Intel
still a 20% increase in performance for
a 100% increase in price might be a
tough sell povery is another raytracer
it's been around for many years now and
we're using the official benchmark here
the 79 80 XC was just 11% fast in the
1950 X while the 79 60 X was 7% faster
so while Intel's new 16 core 1:18 core
parts are certainly faster they're not
really that much faster all right so
it's time for a few quick gaming
benchmarks before we look at the power
consumption and temperatures here we're
testing battlefield one using the
DirectX 12 API with the ultra quality
preset enabled all the games have been
tested using the GTX 1080i and Vega 64
GPUs and first up we have the GeForce
results here we see that 3 Ripper
doesn't look particularly impressive but
it has to be said with over 100 FPS at
all times
the game was incredibly smooth please
note that I'm not bothering the test the
thread Ripper CPUs with that game mode
enabled resetting your workstation to
play a couple of games isn't
particularly realistic so I'm only going
to test with the distributed memory mode
as for the 79 60 X and 79 80 X 8 they do
quite well despite trailing the lower
core count parts but that was pretty
much to be expected then as we change
things up by dropping in Vegas 64
liquid-cooled the frame rates don't
change drastically for the quad core
Core i7 77 40 X when compared to what we
saw with the GTX 1080i however the AMD
processors perform much better and we're
now seeing significantly more
competitive performance across the board
with Vega so that's very interesting to
see moving on we have ashes of the
singularity escalation again we're
testing with the 1080 TI first here the
core ARM processors deliver the best
results while thread repeat is
comparable to the core i7 78 20x however
when we retest with Vega we do see much
more competitive results from all tested
CPUs the 1950 X again matches the 78 20x
but they're much closer to the core i9
models now next that we have
civilization
six and here the risin seven 1800 X is
very competitive with the core i7 77 40
X when using the gtx 1080i meanwhile the
1950 X matched the r7 1700 and both were
much faster than the Intel skylake X
CPUs particularly the new 16 and 18 core
parts switching over to the Vega 64
liquid core graphics card we once again
find quite different results and this
time of the AMD CPUs are able to pull
much further ahead of these Scarlett X
parts and even the 7740 X falls behind
the thread rippen 1950 ex finishing up
the gaming benchmarks we have f1 2017
and this is the only DirectX 11 title
we're testing with here the core I 979
60 X and 79 80 X look very weak though
keep in mind they're still pushing over
100 FPS at all times meanwhile it's
worth noting that the 1950 X offers
considerably better minimum frame rate
performance than even the 7900 X that
said it's worth noting that the quad
core 77 40 X is the real hero here
pushing well over 200 FPS for the most
part switching over to Vega doesn't
change too much here though the average
frame rate of the 1950 X is now much
better than any of the Scarlett X parts
and in fact we do say that Rison is the
king of the big core count CPUs here
next that we have the power consumption
figures and it's important to measure
using software that stresses all the
cores so for that I've used Corona and
that works very well providing very
accurate results so these load figures
are based on the current and benchmark
after a single pass I'm reporting the
maximum log to result what you see he is
total system dry I'm using the Quebec
palmate to measure from the wall the
third River 1950 X sucked down 275 watts
and that meant that the total system
consumption was 8% lower than that of
the core I nine 7900 x interestingly the
79 ATX he actually drew less power than
the 79 60 X in this test both CPUs
delivered very similar performance so
this suggests that the 79 60 X had to
clock much more aggressively to achieve
that result and this meant greater power
draw under full load the 79 60 X system
was consuming around 25 percent more
power than the 1950 X while the 79 80 XE
consumes 16% more power okay so time to
do a little tinkering
the 79 80 XE over
clocked all calls to 4.1 gigahertz quite
easily it's probably possible to go
further but for now this is where I
stopped due to power drawing a few other
reasons the 79 60 X was happy at 4.3
gigahertz and of course previously we
got the 70 100x 24.7 year gets thread
Ripper has also been thrown into the mix
clocked at 4 gigahertz clocked at 4.1
gig 'it's the 79 80 XE produced a multi
thread score of three thousand nine
hundred and seventy four points so
expect to see some people breaking the
4000 barrier with this one that's a 20
percent increase over the out of the box
score as well the 79 60 X saw a 17
percent boost as it hit an impressive
three thousand six hundred and
eighty-one points the thread Ripper 1950
X only managed to boost its
out-of-the-box performance by 13 percent
but even so that allowed for a score of
three thousand four hundred and twenty
four points overclock the 79 80 XE was
just 16% fast in the 1950 x so it'll be
interesting to see what kind of
difference this makes in the real world
let's check out our extreme blender
workload well honestly it's not really a
huge amount
both the skylark X parts now 9 percent
faster while thread Ripper is now at 11%
faster even so the 16 core and 18 core
Intel CPUs are blistering fast in this
test okay so what about power draw you
ask well you tell me overclocked thread
Ripper pushes total system draw to 414
watts and that's pretty extreme that
said it does pale in comparison to the
7900 X at 475 watts then we have the 79
60 X pushing total system draw to over
500 watts and finally the 79 80 XE at
530 watts remember this is just CPU load
we're measuring here so if you have a
few high-end GPUs in your workstation
you might want to go and acquire one of
those zpm modules to power it due to the
limited time we had to test these new
CPUs I haven't really explored the
cooling options all that much
I simply to remember on our custom
cooled x-29
test bed and got benchmarking so I'm yet
to see how badly they punished air
coolers and all-in-one liquid coolers at
the stock clock speeds the 79 80 X the
only push temps as high as 65 degrees
which is certainly getting up there
given that we do have a massive 360
millimeter
right attached to the loop then once
overclocked to 4.1 gigahertz on all
course temperatures did hit 77 degrees
which is quite a few degrees higher than
what we saw from the 7900 X at 4.7
gigahertz okay so as usual we have quite
a bit of data to make sense of of course
it's not just about delivering the best
performance I think rather most of you
we more interest in how much bang for
your buck you're really getting so that
being the case let's take a look at a
few price versus performance scatter
plots first that we have blender and
this is a lower is better scenario which
is why the numbers at the bottom of the
chart work backwards the faster a CPU
the further to the right it will be and
the lower the price well the lower it
will be situated so ideally you want to
be as far right as possible and as low
as possible on the chart it's a little
confusing so here is our line indicating
the very best value CPU starting from
the Rison seven seventeen hundred and
going through to the 1950 X anything
along this line offers a good balance
between price and performance and of
course anything to the right of the line
is exceptional as you can see though the
only Intel CPU to touch this line was
the core i7 7820 X while slightly faster
than the 1950 X we see that in terms of
value the 79 60 X and 79 80 X II a
shocking value but hey who's surprised
looking at handbrake we see at the Intel
Core i7 7800 X and i7 78 20x look to be
mixing it up with the AMD CPUs whipping
out our linear line from the r7 1,700 to
the 1950 X we see that the 7800 X and
7820 X actually present as better value
options when compared to the AMD CPUs
even the 79 60 X moves closer to the
line in this test though ultimately
isn't great in terms of value while the
7890 XE is again horrible finally let's
take a look at the price versus
performance ratio and testing with
Premiere Pro CC here we again see that
all of the AMD processors look to
deliver a similar bang for your buck
while the core i7 70 100 X and 78 20x
are in the mix as well throwing up our
linear line we see that the core i7 CPUs
with the exception of the 77 40 X do
very well the new 79 60 X and 79 80 XE
though while they don't do
very well Adil when it comes to value
unfortunately those price to performance
scatter plots really summarize things
quite well in my opinion the new Intel
Core on ion series is blistering fast in
every test but ultimately didn't end up
being that much faster than the thread
rip in 1950 X given they cost anywhere
from 70 to 100 percent more it's hard to
justify the often just 10 percent
increase in performance over clocked
these skylake X parts aren't worlds
faster either they're only around 15 or
20 percent faster than the overclocked
to 1950 X while they did draw around 20
percent more power so this puts Intel's
new 16 core and 18 core CPUs in a bit of
a jam if you ask me now that we've seen
how they do perform it looks like the
conclusion I draw my thread Reaper 1950
X in 1920 X review was pretty spot-on I
said it a guess it looks like consumers
will need to spend at least $1,400 us to
acquire the I 979 40 X to match AMD's
1950 X and I seriously doubt the 40%
price premium will be worth it this
certainly looks to be the case now that
we've seen the 16 core model in action I
also noted that the other big issue the
X 299 platform faces other than the
extreme price is its complete lack of
ECC memory support whereas thread Ripper
supports ECC memory the Scarlet X chips
don't how that means anyone serious
about their workstation won't even
consider intel's high-end desktop
platform finally i concluded by saying
unless intel was willing to move on
price which it now seems very evident
they're not i can't see why anyone would
invest in the x 299 platform and while
that's my honest opinion and this really
hasn't changed with the arrival of the
16 core and 18 core parts in fact it's
probably just cemented that opinion
unless I had money to burn and I suppose
even then I would really struggle to
imagine a scenario where I would spend
$1000 u.s. more so a hundred percent
more on the core I 979 80 XE just again
at best maybe 20% more performance time
really would have to be money and a lot
of it that said though there are
certainly businesses that could justify
the investment the less time staffs
around waiting for a task to complete
the quicker they can get on with the job
so
offering the world's most powerful
desktop / workstation cpu intel will be
more appealing in those scenarios the
rest of us though us in Suzy estaba Blee
going to be hard to justify spending
this kind of money on these CPUs well
that's about all I have to say for now I
think that summarizes things pretty well
Intel's obviously very competitive when
it comes to performance I mean they do
now have the world's most powerful
desktop CPU that is at least until I'm
damaged that thread rip is really
nothing more than a disabled epic CPU
and released a 24 core model just to
stick it to Intel they say that's not
going to happen but come on guys as if
they're not gonna now is that before the
end of the year I'm Yahoo Steve see you
