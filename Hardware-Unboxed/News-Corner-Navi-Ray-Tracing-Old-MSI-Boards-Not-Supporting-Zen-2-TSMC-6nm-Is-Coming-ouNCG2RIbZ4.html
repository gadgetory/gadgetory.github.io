corner big week of news has just
occurred lots of topics to get through
in what is a bit of a surprise given
April tends to be one of the slowest
months of the year also you might have
noticed a few items slowly disappearing
from the back of my set here that's
because I'm moving house which means
this set does need to be deconstructed
if you're interested in getting a
behind-the-scenes look at that process
and new boxing boxer series we'll be
running over the next few weeks on our
patreon behind-the-scenes channel so
check that out if you are a patreon
member anyway let's get on with the show
so one of the bigger news stories to
emerge this week concerns the
PlayStation 5 now we aren't a console
gaming channel and really don't care
what Sony or Microsoft are doing with
the next-gen consoles for the most part
but an exclusive published in why this
week has revealed a few tidbits about
the PS 5 that are relevant for us PC
gamers out there it's no surprise that
the PS 5 will have an AMD chip insight I
think most people assume this would be
the case it's also not surprising that
the CPU side will be using AMD Zen 2
architecture built on 7 animators and in
fact there will be 8 cores however the
small tidbit here that is getting PC
gamers excited concerns the GPU Sony is
using a custom variant of radians Navi
family and that GPU will support ray
tracing we don't know a whole lot about
Navi in fact we know basically nothing
because Amb hasn't even begun teasing
the technology but this reveal could
hint at what is in store for PC gamers
Navi for desktop PCs might support ray
tracing unfortunately we really are
stuck with just saying it might support
ray tracing because at the end of the
day nothing has been confirmed even if
this GPU supports ray tracing on
consoles this functionality might not be
present in the desktop GPUs given sony
is specifically using a custom navi
variant ray tracing on consoles could
also involve some special software or
even separate Hardware tricks which
might not be available on PC it
definitely is exciting that Navi in some
form will support ray tracing and that
could make the jump over to PC but we
just want to temper expectations given
we still have so little information in
fact this teaser for the PS 5 doesn't
reveal any other
interesting specifications relating to
the GPU so we don't know how powerful it
will be the only thing mentioned was
Navi and ray-tracing with more to be
revealed down the line the second story
is one that quickly blew up and
generated a lot of discussion in our
patreon exclusive discord community MSI
are not going to support AMD Xen two
processes on their 300 serious
motherboards at least this was the story
that was generated on reddit from an
email thread from one of MSI's customer
service representatives if this story
were true it would of course be very
disappointing as the whole premise of
AMD's a m4 platform was that the socket
would be supported for several
generations up to 2020 so people could
comfortably buy a 300 series motherboard
knowing that they can upgrade to a more
powerful CPU in a few years time without
needing to replace the motherboard this
upgrade path has been a huge selling
point for Rison and its motherboards and
something we've talked about a lot
luckily for MSI 300 series owners the
story was basically a load of crap MSI
issued a clarification stating that
actually Xen - will be supported as
expected on most of MSI's 300 and 400
series motherboards it's not clear if
every board will be supported MSI say
they are still performing extensive
testing on our existing lineup of 300
and 400 series and 4 motherboards to
verify potential compatibility for the
next-gen AMD rise and cpus and the list
of boards with confirmed support for zen
- doesn't have every single board on the
market however most boards are on the
list including all the major ones or
high-end ones and all the popular ones
including be 350 boards so I think there
shouldn't be much concern about support
moving forward in another story related
to AMD it appears as though the company
is preparing a collection of 50th
anniversary products to of course
celebrate the company's 50th birthday
however it doesn't appear as though
these products are anything new so
nothing's n2 or na'vi based instead
they're just special editions of
existing products one retailer shot BLT
personally listening for a Rison 720 700
X 50th anniversary edition CPU with a
higher price than the regular version of
this CPU the listing has since been
pulled down unfortunately we don't know
anything about specs or whether this
special 2700 X will be any different
from other 2700 X's although we'd expect
the 50th anniversary model to include
especially engraving on the heat
spreader I doubt though we'll see any
changes to specs sapphire also appear to
be readying a gold version of their rx
519 Nitro+ GPU we're not sure if this is
in fact related to amy's 50th
anniversary celebrations or whether
sapphire has just felt like making a
gold variant but either way you should
be able to get this product soon final
ambi story before moving on to other
things
right now you can get a risin 5 1600
processor for a super cheap price of
just $120 through Amazon and Newegg or
just $80 in store at Micro Center the
CPU has briefly appeared at $120 for a
few days last month but it's never been
available for $80 making it a bit of a
steal right now considering it's still a
very capable CPU I'd expect to see more
of these types of discounts as we get
closer to ambe's risin 3000 series
launched in the next few months
tsmc has unveiled a new manufacturing
process they're calling 6 nanometers or
CLM 6ff this new node is focused
primarily on providing higher transistor
density than their 7 nanometer node
offering 18% higher density without any
significant improvements to performance
or power consumption to achieve this the
company is using new capabilities in
extreme ultraviolet lithography you
might be wondering why would tsmc
develop 6 nanometers alongside 7
nanometre plus their other node that's 6
8 7 animators when seven animated plus
provides higher transistor density as
well as performance and power
improvements you think that most
companies wouldn't bother with 6
nanometers and just go from 7 nanometers
to 700 meters plus however 6 nanometers
uses many of the same design rules of 7
nanometers so a company that already has
a design for seven nanometer should be
able to transition it to six nanometers
at a reasonably low cost at least lower
than what it would take to bring that
design to set a nanometer plus this
could be beneficial to customers that
are targeting density over other
improvements and I want to achieve this
at the lowest possible development cost
6 nano meters will begin risk production
in the first quarter of 2020 and should
be available for a broad range of
applications according to TSM C and in
other foundry news samsung has completed
development on their 5 nanometer
technology which like most leading-edge
processes uses extreme ultraviolet
lithography
samsung says that compared to seven
nanometers five nanometers brings a 25%
increase in logic area efficiency with
either 20% lower power consumption or
10% higher performance so that's a
pretty decent game samsung also says
that the transition from seven
nanometers to five nanometers should be
pretty easy as it reuses a lot of IP
moving into monitor news now and we have
four new interesting displays from Acer
that were announced this week the lineup
is a little confusing but there are lots
of attractive hi and display C that I
think will interest gamers the first one
is the ace of Predator CG 437 K which
despite receiving predator branding is
actually just a freesync MOA though
these are now compatible with NVIDIA
GPUs anyway so this is a 43 inch 3840 by
2160 v a display with a 144 hertz
maximum refresh rate 90% coverage of DCI
p3 and peak brightness of 1000 nits its
display HDR 1000 certified as a result
there's no word on specific local
dimming capabilities but it has to
include at least some form of dimming to
be displayed hgl 1000 certified this
sounds like a pretty compelling large
monitor for gamers and it will be
available for thirteen hundred US
dollars around August to September next
up we have the ASA concept D cm 7 3 2 1
K which is a 32 inch 4k IPS display with
mini LED backlighting this monitor
should be quite similar to the seuss
models we talked about last week and
that it has 1152 local dimming zones
peak brightness of 1000 nits and 99%
Adobe RGB coverage positioned is more of
a content creation display it is only 60
Hertz
it has factory calibration to adult a of
less than 1 and lots of creative
specific features it will also have a
pro grade price of $3,000 when it
launches in September then we have the
ace of concept DCP 7 to 7 1k addressing
ultimate display that's designed for
both content creators and gamers it has
a 27 inch 4k panel and up to 144 Hertz
with display hgl 1000 certification so
again it will have local dimming and ASA
says it supports a 93% DCI p3 coverage
this monitor will cost two thousand
dollars and will be available in July
then finally we have the concept DCP 3
to 7 1 K another 27 inch 4k 1/4
four Hertz monitor again designed for
content creation with battery
calibration to a delta a of less than
one as well as gaming with that high
refresh rate and adaptive sync however
this isn't as high end of a monitor as
the CP 7-2 7-1 K so it lacks local
dimming and is only certified for
display HDR 400 no word on pricing or
launch date for this one gigabyte are
expanding into yet another market with
their horas branding this time CPU
coolers with the ATC 800 a beefy tower
core with dual 120 millimeter RGB fans
and six six millimeter nickel plated
copper heat pipes
weighing in at a little over one
kilogram the cooler is good for up to
200 watt loads and support sockets
including AM for LGA 2066
and LGA 1150 X no word on pricing or
release date just yet I think we'll see
more of this at Computex and we're going
to round this one out with the latest
set of gtx 1650 rumours from video cards
they're claiming the nuturing based
graphics card will pack 896 CUDA cores
four gigabytes of gddr5 memory on a
128-bit bus and will be clocked at
fourteen eighty five megahertz base and
sixteen sixty five megahertz boost
allegedly the card is launching April
23rd for 149 dogs we haven't seen specs
for this card just yet but everything
here sounds about right and it shouldn't
be too long until we learn how invidious
rx 570 competitor will fare that's if
this week's news corner hope everyone is
enjoying their Easter break here in
Australia we have best be a four-day
public holiday in the Miss Anzac Day
next week as well so definitely lots of
breaks enjoy that time off subscribe to
