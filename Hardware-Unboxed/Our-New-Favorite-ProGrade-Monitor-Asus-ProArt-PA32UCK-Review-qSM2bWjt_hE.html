I'm looking at another monitor but this
one I guess it probably won't appeal to
everyone who watches this channel
because it's a professional-grade
display from a soos we all have gaming
just place you at hardware and box but
we also love our productivity and for us
as video editors sometimes you need to
step up to a pro grade minor so you can
do your work properly and accurately the
monitor I'm looking at today is the asus
pro art PA 32 you see - k and before you
ask like a lot of professional monitors
it's not cheap in fact it costs a full
two thousand dollars u.s. or 3500 ozzie
but before you complain about that eye
watering price it could be the ultimate
professional monitor and I don't say
that lightly because pro grade monitors
need to be top-notch quality to get a
recommendation
luckily the pro op PA 32 you see is
packed with nearly every feature a
creator might require for both SDR and
HDR work we'll get to the specs in just
a moment but this is a serious beast in
terms of hardware before that though big
share had to Asus let me bro this
monitor for six weeks that was more than
nine weeks ago so this review is a
culmination of my thoughts from using
this monitor for quite some time now I
wanted to see how well it would
integrate into our creative workflow as
content creators and spoiler alert it
does pass a lot of tests so the name Pro
art PA 32 you see is pretty unassuming
and doesn't really tell us anything
about what this monitor is made out of
in fact it sounds rather boring but this
is far from a boring monitor as Seuss's
packed in almost every feature you could
think of it's a 32 inch 3840 by 2160 IPS
panel at 60 Hertz with adaptive sync it
sports 100% sRGB color space coverage
99.5% Adobe RGB and 95% DCI p3 hitting
all those wide gamuts it's fully HDR
compatible with a 384 zone F Ald
backlight it has Thunderbolt 3 and
crucially it comes with a hardware
calibration tool in the box which makes
getting accurate results a breeze for
all buyers not just those that already
have calibration tools on hand
I'm not a huge fan of azusa's gaming
monitor designs particularly for their
rog products but the pro art pi32 you
see is a completely different story this
monitor is sleek and simple with thin
bezels allowing the panel to dominate
the front a simple silver standard with
a slimmer than expected pillar and a
minimalist brushed plastic rear the
display section of the monitor is quite
chunky to accommodate the fa LD
backlight but I reckon this beast looks
fantastic front on the stand is highly
adjustable supporting tilt height pivot
and swivel adjustment so you can use the
monitor in a portrait orientation if you
need to the on screen display is
controlled by a directional toggle which
is great to see and there's a ton of
features professionals might find useful
in there some of which we'll discuss
throughout the rest of the review as the
inputs a suit has gone all out providing
for hdmi 2.0 inputs a single DisplayPort
1.2 and 2 Thunderbolt 3 USB sea ports
one for input and one for output there's
also a USB 3.0 hub with two taipei ports
and one type-c port so yet there's
basically every modern port on this
monitor and the Thunderbolt 3 port
provides up to 60 watts of power
delivery which should be enough to
charge a lot of laptops when plugged
into this beast when a professional
monitor lists HDR support I expect real
HDR support and that's exactly the case
with the PA 32 you see there's actually
surprisingly a lot of professional
monitors that don't tick every box in my
monitor HDR check list but this one does
with a thousand nits of peak brightness
and 615 it's sustained full-array local
dimming with 384 zones near full DCI p3
gamut coverage and a 10 bit panel
through FRC some professionals might be
disappointed the panel isn't true 10 bit
but the fic implementation here is
actually one of the best I've seen with
much much less banding than other 8-bit
Plus FRC panels I've reviewed when
looking at our 10 bit gradient stress
test in terms of brightness accuracy the
PA 32 you see gets within 10 percent of
the exact nits target when viewing HDR
content which is a good result the panel
is capable of up to 1200 nits with the
window size up to 25% after which it
falls back to its 615 it's sustained
value unfortunately the PA 32 you see
can't produce a 1000 it full screen
flash again topping out
700 nits however the backlights lowest
level of just 0.012 nits is the lowest
I've seen from an hgr monitor with local
dimming this creates a contrast ratio up
to 98,000 to 1 in best case scenarios
government coverage is also around 96%
DCI p3 so the monitor is capable of
displaying colors well outside a normal
SDR range all up this monitor has an
excellent HDR implementation among the
best for HDR monitors on the market
right now again thanks to the 384 zone
FA LD backlight the low black levels are
particularly impressive with the dynamic
backlight not every aspect of the HJ
implementation is perfect though due to
the use of an IPS panel there is a bit
of glow present in some situations when
only a few FA LD backlight zones are
enabled in the worst-case scenario I
observed a contrast ratio around 2500 to
1g this glow but visually it's a bit
ugly luckily this is only a major issue
when viewing thin white lines on a black
background or white text on a black
background in movies or games is
practically invisible and for content
creators not working with HDR
the default behaviour is to disable the
dynamic backlight so the issue goes away
completely for SDR work though of course
you can enable the feature for SDR work
if you want to I would say though that
this particular HDR monitor isn't
suitable for HDR gaming because the FAL
D backlight response is a little slow
there's a gradual fall off time of
around 1 to 2 seconds for the backlight
to switch off after displaying a bright
image which can cause trailing in
extreme fast motion like you might get
in a say a dark fast-paced shooter with
bright gun flashes for example I'd have
liked to see perhaps a faster backlight
option like a soos provides with a
gaming grade PG 27 UQ but from what I
observe a video work this is a non-issue
response times for the PA 32 you see are
typical for an IPS panel I recorded a
seven point one eight millisecond
greater great average while a soos
reports 5 milliseconds there are six
overdrive modes the DeSousa lists as
trace free in the settings the default
60 setting introduces a small amount of
overshoot that exceeds our testing
threshold so I reduced it to 40 which
cleared that problem right up 5
millisecond response times are totally
within the realm of possibility at high
overdrive modes but the overshoot
becomes unacceptable in any case an
average response of 7.2 milliseconds for
a non gaming IPS display is decent it's
faster than a typical VA panel and well
under the 16.6 millisecond refresh
window the main issue with the PA 32 you
see is input lag which is very poor and
nearly 60 milliseconds of lag in our
standard test mode this monitor is the
slowest I've tested and I couldn't find
an OSD setting that improves upon this
result when you combine this input lag
with the standard 60 Hertz refresh rate
the monitor does feel a little sluggish
to use again considering response times
themselves are still good the issue with
input lag only really impacts gaming it
didn't have any material effect on
content creation work I've been doing on
the panel over the last few months or
watching things like TV shows or movies
color accuracy is obviously a big part
of how professional monitors should
perform so it's great to see a soos
providing an X right by one display Pro
in the box with the PA 32 you see - K
this allows anyone buying this monitor
to calibrate it continually over its
lifespan so that it remains accurate
initially and for years to come this
isn't some niche edition in fact in my
opinion this is the key selling point to
the PA 32 you see but it gets better
than just having a color emitter in the
box through the use of a Seuss's pro art
calibration software tool you can
generate color accurate profiles and
save them to the monitor this is an
absolute godsend for content credits
because software profiles you set within
windows can only get you so far it's not
every application supports or adheres to
basic ICC profiles with the PA 32 you
see you can basically ignore software
profiles altogether and just save the
profile directly into the monitors
firmware then you can not only use your
exact calibrated profile with your main
PC but with any device you hook up to
the monitor including those that don't
allow software side calibration like a
blu-ray player game console or say a
chromecast the pro art calibration
software is super easy to use you can
set your color space brightness gamma
and white point targets then you just
plug in the I 1 display Pro to the
monitor the tool gets to work and you
can save your profile into one of the
two User Profile slots having two slots
is also important because you can then
have an accurate srgb Pro
and an accurate DCI p3 profile for
example allowing you to switch between
them whenever you're working with wide
gamut content or not a soos own software
isn't as accurate as spectra Cal's
camera and five that we normally use for
display calibration but it still gets
the PA 32 you see to a point that
content credit should be happy with when
calibrating to srgb I was able to
achieve a grayscale Delta e below 2.0
decent enough white balance good gamma
and both saturation and color checker
Delta averages around that 1.0 mark
which is basically dead accurate
combined with 99.5% srgb coverage and
that's a fantastic result for color
accurate work especially as this profile
is saved directly to the display itself
and you can recalibrate the monitor as
many times as you like over the lifespan
of the display for DCI p3 calibrated
results weren't quite as accurate for
grayscale with a bit of wonkiness to the
CCT curve
however color performance was still very
accurate with Delta II averages of 1.07
and one point two to four saturation and
color checker tests respectively so
after running the isuzu wizard with the
tool provider in the Box you can quite
easily send accurate srgb and wide gamut
profiles to the monitor which is exactly
what you want from a professional-grade
monitor those who want to even greater
levels of accuracy which probably isn't
necessary unless you have strict Delta
II standards of sub 1.0 for perfect
accuracy you can use Kalman 5 to create
software profile which could be used in
conjunction with the on display profile
through extreme accuracy and as you
might expect here we were able to create
a very accurate profile with essentially
no issues there are a few other reasons
why having the calibration tools
provided is great for buyers there are
lots of professional-grade monitors out
there they come with profiles calibrated
at the factory including the PA 32 you
see which definitely gets you part of
the way there but often these profiles
come with restrictions for example the
PA 32 uses factory srgb mode there is no
way to change the brightness level
you're stuck at 165 nits
using the calibration tools allows you
to set a brightness target yourself and
monitor accuracy does degrade over time
so factory calibration will be less
accurate a year after you purchased the
monitor again the included calibration
tool means you can continually ensure
the display is accurate
calibration also allows you to correct
errors with factory calibration in the
case of the PA 32 you see the default
factory srgb mode uses a 7500 K white
point target rather than the correct
6500 K this is a bit bizarre for a
professional monitor targeting srgb and
if the calibration tools weren't
provided I'd definitely slam a soos for
this mistake because the factory profile
is not accurate but when the tools are
there I'd recommend and I would even
expect anyone purchasing this display
for professional use will perform a
calibration after taking it out of the
box which corrects the problem and
really makes it less of an issue the
final area of performance I want to look
at is uniformity again this is an area
as soos allows you to calibrate using
their pro art calibration software which
is unique because calibrating uniformity
is often very difficult aside from these
sorts of tools naturally I'd recommend
buyers use the uniformity calibration
tool straight out of the box alongside a
full color calibration however even with
a uniformity calibration results are a
little weak for a professional-grade
display it's definitely good overall
especially in the center of the display
but for a pro grade monitor and what the
entire screen reporting with the sub 2.0
Delta II relative to the center some
outer areas are up over 3.0 and I
suspect this is partially down to the
fal d backlight getting an even result
out of this sort of backlight is
certainly quite tricky
I guess the disappointing thing here is
uniformity is actually worse for this
monitor compared to the gaming grade a
soprano 2 X 27 which also uses a 384 so
an FA LD backlight that monitor also
features better factory calibration
though it doesn't support some of the
calibration features I've been talking
about throughout this review so it's
probably not suitable for most
professionals so at the start of this
review I talked about the PA 32 you see
as the ultimate professional monitor and
that's for a couple of reasons
this display provides pro-grade
calibration features with the tools you
need provided in the box
combined with high-end display hardware
particularly for HDR the PA 32 you see
provides everything you need for
accurate srgb work accurate wide gamut
work and HDR work and it's not fake HDR
we're talking genuine full-blown HDR
with great brightness elite contrast and
proper color support asus is doing this
with a 32
display which right now is unique there
are some pro great when seven-inch HDR
monitors with a similar feature set like
Dells u P 27:18 Q but at a smaller size
and I tend to think 32 inches is a bit
better for 4k work right now the U P
27:18 Q is cheaper though so it is
something to consider those looking for
just an entertainment or gaming display
with HDR shouldn't opt for the PA 32 you
see though that should be obvious
considering this Pro out display is
toggling professionals not gamers the
Acer predator X 27 provides a similar
feature set with great factory
calibration and a higher 144 Hertz
refresh rate with chasing HDR for the
same price at the pier 32 you see those
who want to do both creative work and
gaming on the one display chaucer up for
the X 27 in my opinion unless you know
professional work is really what you
want the monitor for but if you're in
the market for a proper 32 inch HDR
display for content creation
productivity or other professional work
I definitely recommend the PA 32 you see
and I've been loving using this for my
video production workflow over the last
weeks and months that's not to say it's
perfect
input lag is a concern uniformity isn't
quite where I wanted to be despite the
uniformity calibration feature the
factory calibrated profiles are a little
off and contrast without the dynamic
backlight enabled is only me seven
hundred to one when calibrated but most
of these issues are only minor for
productivity work of course the final
question is whether you should spend
$2,000 on a monitor because that
certainly sounds like a lot of money
however most pro grade monitors started
around the $1,000 mark so when you put
that in perspective the $2,000 price of
this 32 inch 4k panel with proper HDR
doesn't sound as outrageous unlike the
gaming grade PG 27 UQ which is more than
triple the price of a good gaming
display Dells 32 inch 4k non HDR wide
gamut professional-grade
u P 32 16 Q is 1400 US dollars for
example and that price goes up by 260
dollars if you want the color
calibration tool included with it so
that kind of gives you an idea of where
the PA 32 you see sits and for $2000
it's certainly not an outrageous price
anyway the PA 32 use
has been great for my workflow in the
performance numbers included calibration
tool and hardware capabilities of this
panel just add to the package that's it
