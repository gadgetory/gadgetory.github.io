taken the gaming and enthusiast PC market
by storm over the last few years, as have
the Cherry MX brand switches. There aren’t
a lot of brands left that are employing their
own key switch implementations, however Thermaltake
happen to be one of them with their Tt eSPORTS
Poseidon range of gaming keyboards.
Today I’m going to be taking a look at the
latest installment in this range - the Poseidon
Z RGB, in conjunction with their Ventus X
gaming mouse and XXXXXXXXXXXX desk mat to
see what kind of gaming experience Thermaltake
are offering up with their very best peripherals.
Ready to dive in? Let’s go!
I want to look over the design of the Ventus
X first. The first thing you’ll notice is
the unique aesthetics - there’s a hexagonal
honeycomb cage at the rear of the mouse that
shows off the illuminated Tt eSPORTS logo
inside, and also offers ventilation for your
hand. I think this is pretty clever, and will
suit those with sweaty palms especially.
The shape of the mouse itself is nothing too
fancy - which is a good thing, and it’s
overall size is bigger than most; definitely
a little larger in the body than most of Logitech’s
offerings, for instance.
This size makes the mouse suited to those
with slightly larger hands, and perhaps even
a palm grip, though it’s not as though the
mouse is huge and unusable for those with
smaller hands. Both sides of the mouse offer
a soft and also honeycomb-textured grip pad,
which feel great beneath the thumb and pinkie
finger and give the mouse a more premium feel.
The Ventus X is certainly a right-handed mouse.
The two thumb buttons are located on the left
hand side, and the entire mouse leans off
to the right to improve right handed ergonomics.
Grooves around the left and right mouse buttons
also help your fingers rest in place comfortably.
The underside of the mouse features large
teflon mouse feet, that offer a nice and relatively
effortless glide over your mouse pad, and
you’ll also find a little door, inside which
you can configure the heft of the mouse with
the included set of three nickel-plated weights.
In terms of hardware, the Ventus employs an
Avago 9500 laser and ARM-based 32bit microcontroller,
which of course feel very accurate when gaming
and in Windows, and can be adjusted in the
Tt eSPORTS software from 100 DPI through to
the maximum 5700 DPI. There’s also 128kb
of onboard memory to store information such
as profiles and macros on the mouse itself.
The Tt eSPORTS software looks nice and is
powerful enough to allow you to customise
the mouse’s functionality as you see fit.
All six buttons on the mouse are programmable,
if that’s your thing, and you can also assign
macros, create different profiles, and link
these profiles to certain programs and games.
With the mouse’s red-only lighting, you
can toggle off the scroll wheel lighting and
logo lighting individually, and also engage
“Battle Mode”, where the lighting fires
off in line with your clicks. Pretty cool,
but I could see it being a little distracting.
Currently available for $49 USD, or $59 AUD
online it’s extremely hard to fault the
Ventus X at all. Users that like to have a
wealth of customisable buttons might be left
wanting a little, but aside from that I think
anyone would be happy to game on it. The hardware
is top notch, the software is easy to use
and powerful, and the ventilated body is a
great idea and implementation.
I’m a massive fan of large form factor mouse
pads. To provide beautiful glide beneath the
Ventus X, I have on hand Tt eSPORTS’ new
DASHER Extended edition, which is a full 900mm
wide, and 400mm high. The bottom side of the
DASHER uses an anti-slip rubber base to keep
in place, and the top side is a speedy cloth
weave that feels as nice as any I’ve used
before. Proving Thermaltake’s attention
to detail is a fully solid sewn edge, which
prevents any sort of annoying fraying or peeling
away that can otherwise occur over time.
The pad is 4mm thick, and provides a nice
amount of cushion for your wrist, but still
provides a nice firm surface for your mouse
and doesn’t leave any sort of imprint where
your keyboard legs sit. I love being able
to sit my entire keyboard on my mousepad,
so the Extended edition of the DASHER was
a no-brainer, but you can also get it in a
medium, and mini slim size, which is only
2mm thick. The Extended DASHER is just $35
in both the USA and Australia, and at that
price it’s a really great buy, down under
especially.
Now let’s take a look at the Ventus X’s
partner in crime - the Poseidon Z RGB mechanical
gaming keyboard. I’ve been a big fan of
Cherry’s keyboard switches, and in particular
the very loud and clicky Cherry MX Blue switches,
so I was very interested to check out the
Poseidon Z with Thermaltake’s very own kailh
blue switches.
Upon using the Poseidon, I was immediately
impressed and felt at home with the blue switches.
They definitely aren’t identical to the
Cherry MX blues, but the feel and sound is
quite similar. The clicky feel is very similar
- if anything it feels a little sharper, and
there is definitely less key wobble. The sound
the keys make is a little lower in pitch,
and maybe a little bit quieter, but there
isn’t a huge difference in volume.
The key layout is very much standard, with
the right side Windows key being replaced
by the function key. The F keys all have additional
functions that are enabled when this is pressed,
including full media controls, lighting controls,
and a macro record key for on the fly macros.
The only extra button is a Windows key toggle
at the very top right, which cleverly makes
the Windows key instead function as a Ctrl
key.
Profiles can also be switched between on the
fly by using the function key in conjunction
with the Home, Insert, Page Up, Delete and
End keys, and you can also toggle N-Key Rollover
on the fly with the PgDn key.
The underside of the keyboard features cable
routes that go either way, which I like, and
rubberised feet keep the keyboard in place.
Fold down legs can adjust the keyboard’s
height, and there are even two rubberised
pads on the backside of the keyboard - these
are designed to protect the keyboard when
you place it backside down in your carry bag;
particularly the Thermaltake’s own Battle
Dragon Bag.
The Tt eSPORTS software initially updated
the keyboard’s firmware quickly and easily,
and then I was away. Inside you can create
and customise macros, select different profiles,
and of course, play around with the RGB lighting.
There are five presets to choose from, with
options within each preset to customise further.
In Oz-land, you can pick up the Poseidon Z
RGB in brown or blue switches for $150, and
on the USA Amazon it will set you back just
over $90 USD. At this price, I think it’s
a pretty great buy. I’m a fan of Thermaltake’s
switches, and the keyboard will suit those
that prefer a smaller overall footprint.
There’s no wrist rest included, nor is there
a USB pass through, and these are two of my
favourite add-ons so it goes without saying
that I would love to see a Poseidon model
that included both of these features. Thermaltake
kindly offer a 5 year warranty on their switches,
so those that have never ventured away from
Cherry MX can feel comfortable knowing that
they are safe in Thermaltake’s hands.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
