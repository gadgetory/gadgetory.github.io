month's QA
I'm here with Tim without wasting more
time we're gonna jump into the questions
okay first question is from YouTube if
AMD made there be 350 motherboard
overclockable why didn't L not make
there be 360 overclockable and keep the
H 370 locked
okay the be 360 mh370 sorry yeah I've
got lost first question guys I'm a bit
slow off the mark
okay well the H 370 or H 370 rather is a
more premium product on the B 360 so if
they were going to give one of those
chipset overclocking support it would be
the H 370 but anyway the real issue here
I guess is why isn't Intel offering
overclocking support on their budget
boards and yeah while very annoying I
suppose it's not really a big deal
enough you'd agree with that because
you've got the 87 or okay which is what
330 us or something
the 80 600 K which is very expensive so
you can put that on a $60 board or $70
board and so we got the core i3 83 50k
so that might be the only one there that
would make sense but data 350 K I
probably would buy anyway I just get the
core i5 8400 yep I've got a bit lost in
that one but I suppose to just answer
your question Intel do it because they
can yeah pretty much
so this one's from YouTube does the Tim
between the IHS and silicon on older
CPUs ever lose its efficacy for example
a 2600 K how long does that take to
happen and would it be worth it to deal
it and replace hmm okay I don't know
exactly I would say well everything
degrades so over some period of time yes
it would degrade and lose performance
I've got some 3770k and 3570 cage ships
that well they're quite old now I've had
them
since they were provided on day one and
they seem very similar to when I first
got them so I'd say it's not really to
be something you'd need to worry about
enough there's anyone in the comment
section that's seen any real variance in
temperatures from day one I suppose
there aren't that many people that still
have the original ship they probably
bought it secondhand so they don't know
what it did brand new but I know what
mine did the day I got them because it's
in my review and yeah I actually looked
into that when I did a few revisits and
that was like where they were exactly
the same but having said that Ivybridge
as I just mentioned the two Ivy Bridge
processors they were the first ones to
use the Tim the paste and not be
soldered so I believe the 2600 K and the
2500 okay from up until Sandy Bridge
that's when they were sold during them
and then they stopped you know and
everyone upset so yeah I hope that gives
a bit more information on that one
this one's from YouTube as well and
pretty sure this one's for Steve I
wanted to know if capture cards like the
elgato 4k 60 Pro reduced the performance
loss while recording slash streaming
games and should you use a second PC to
do so or just add it to existing one ah
well this is slightly embarrassing I
know I unboxed this oh yeah for the 4k
60 Pro on the channel well as many weeks
ago now and yeah I haven't installed it
it's actually still on the shelf behind
me in my studio it looks very impressive
once I get again the second gen rise and
stuff out of the way I'll get to it so
probably in two to three months but
seriously I think a gamer's Nexus did a
video yeah yeah yeah and that looked
very in-depth I was gamers Nexus video
so be good yeah do I need to say any
more
so if you want to know everything there
is to know about that I suggest jumping
over the gamers Nexus channel and having
a look at their review or whatever they
did on it because it's bound to be very
comprehensive alright next question is
again from youtube this is a fairly
technical question I'm not sure how long
this will take to answer a Tim favorite
Lego set alright it's actually on the
shelf behind me but I might actually get
it for you guys
oh what a trait okay here we go
so this Beaulieu Star Wars fans that
they I'm sure you probably recognize it
immediately this is the ultimate
collectors series slave 1 set so this
was released a couple years ago
it's a minifig scale so it's in inline
with the size of the minifigures you get
with Lego set for bobber FETs
slave 1 it does come with a bobber FET
mini feet but that's over somewhere else
but this model is really detailed and I
love it looks great on the shelf behind
me and that sort of thing so this is one
of the favorite sets I've built and owns
really awesome okay what about when you
get your Millennium Falcon
yeah that might that might you serve and
I get that one I need a new set for that
yeah that's for sure
okay cool okay moving on from the Lego
next question I'd say this one's again
for Tim would you reckon you could post
smartphone reviews on the channel I've
seen one on text but I'd say a video
review by Tim would be very welcomed yes
you have done them in the past on the
channel yes I am I've been pretty busy
with some of the laptop stuff in the
child actually been working on some
videos for the samsung galaxy s 9 plus
that I have so my plan isn't really to
do the full reviews like you see on
techspot I'll still do those for
textbooks so go check those out over
there but here I think I'll be focusing
more on sort of the hardware stuff yeah
looking into the performance of the
processes in the phone looking at the
display and battery life maybe some
separate videos yep that's all the
planner smartphone stuff is we sort of
build up the channel to have more of
that content but like I said been busy
with other things so yeah hopefully
we'll see some more smartphone stuff
throughout the rest of the year all
right next question from YouTube should
be a pretty quick one this one how big
is your mousepad now I'll let you answer
I actually I had to look this up because
my mouse pad is like the most basic
cheap thing ever it's actually quite
good it's the same series qck it's just
320 by 270 millimeters just your
standard everyday mousepad perfect for
me
okay fair enough I am sorry just get
your manly voice on yeah I have one of
those big ones you know for special
people that come to the whole desk I
know I really like that it cushions the
blow when I pass out during a big
benchmark session as well yeah that
happens a lot so all the time yeah can't
do more than about 16 hours without
passing it that's pretty hopeless this
one some youtubers well any qualified
guesses on why dx12 is still under
utilized in modern tiles yep next well
it's more difficult to develop for so
you know companies that don't want to
put in the resources aren't going to
bother with dx12 and also a lot of games
these days are still using upgrade
versions of engines from the x11 area so
they're not going to go and completely
redo the engine to add dx12 in at this
point whereas we see some of those games
that do FDX twelve of running brand-new
spanking engines like the great one from
Wolfenstein - it's really good so yeah
we'll start to see more dx12 tiles as
they start to build more engines but
still firmly in the dx11 era yeah
I'm calling it when DX Thirteen's
announced will start the system to x12
titles probably so from YouTube for
coffee like k-series
should multi core enhancement be enabled
or disabled that's a great question yeah
hmm
well I assume it's in regards to
benchmarking and reviews and stuff like
that
yeah yep so yeah obviously I don't even
moving along I think in regards to
reviews and whatnot you would be best to
test with it disabled but it's also cool
to test with it enabled as a feature
because it's just a really super easy
way to overclock your cpu and get quite
a bit more performance out of it and yet
great like I said feature for
overclocking for inexperienced
overclockers or people that are a bit
scared to give it a go just click the
button it feels a bit safer and it's
still kind of kind of in our operating
parameters they're not for all cores but
anyway I think yeah testing should be
done without it but it'd be fine to do
additional testing with it enable
as well next question is from YouTube
Tim what laptop do you daily use and how
much time do you consider to have one
yeah not quite
not quite sure that last part of the
question means but I do tend to use
review laptops on a daily basis so
whenever I have one to test that's what
I'm using whenever I need to use it
failing that I do have a Broadwell
iredale XPS 13 there's still that works
fairly well it's getting a bit slow
compared to the current 8th gen stuff
but works well enough and for video
anything on the go I use an Acer
predator Triton 700 nice and slim its
15-inch got the H series processor and
the GTX 1060 in it so that works well as
for if you're asking how often I use it
obviously like I game on a desktop I use
a desktop for most editing and everyday
use but you know if I'm out and about if
I want to do some stuff in my living
room or the couch or whatever I use a
laptop
they're just handy to have around just
and a laptop stuff really yeah pretty
much cool
next questions from YouTube how do you
guys manage never to drop anything while
Linus always does well Paul Linus can
you give us some tips yeah I think I've
cracked the perfect solution to this and
it all comes down to him wearing socks
with sandals are akin to you get a low
friction environment at your feet with
socks and sandals that causes unstained
this and it just ripples through your
body and when you're picking up products
with the socks and sandals on you're
just slipping and sliding and doing all
that stuff so my advice is wear proper
shoes that you're meant to having a
proper sock combination go with that and
you'll be able to handle anything
without dropping it
I'm sure Linus will buy that I would
like to see Tim actually benchmarking
the socks and sandals situation and
comparing that to a few different
Footwear items but as for myself I don't
think I've dropped anything I know when
I have things like heat sinks around
that I'm not particularly careful around
those I sort of drive all through them
and I've knocked things off before I
definitely I've only once or twice
training footage of that because I'm
pretty careful with that kind of stuff
like thermal paste application
can get dicey dropping hard wears a
whole other ballgame unless you got
lioness level of a subscribers you just
can't get away with it on a regular
basis
yeah now I did recently knock a heat
sink over onto a motherboard and that
was a bit ah
if anyway no damage was done but I yeah
bit wait for a second there next
question is from YouTube and sorry if
you can hear the ambulance off fire
truck but whatever it is in the
background but we're gonna we're just
going to carry on with yes questions I'm
sure you guys won't mind few sirens and
whatnot
will you make in-house benchmarks like G
ended with the blender renders or with
blender renders huh I've really ever
thought about this I'm probably I don't
think so
yeah we're not that special seriously
though there's just so many good
benchmarks us so many games to test from
and talking about blender there's heaps
of really good applications and blender
workloads out there so I don't feel like
we really need the urge to use our own I
mean if we did use our own I suppose we
could make it publicly available so it's
no different to using ones that are
publicly available but I don't have a
problem with the blender workloads we
have for testing with but yeah half the
time I don't even include a lot of the
tests I'd like to because it's just like
I said so many great applications to
benchmark with and if I included all the
ones I would like to like a simple video
would be 20 minutes long so I think most
of our content is probably long enough
as it is
BAM I think that one answers that
question
all right this question is from Twitter
since you guys have tested CPUs on 720p
because it represents better the
differences between CPU is it possible
to play at 4k with basically any CPU due
to 4k being more GPU bound CPU bound
meaning possibly no difference in 4k
gaming between Rison and coffee like
okay I wasn't gonna be too long before
I'd address this one again yeah okay my
opinion is that 720p is good because you
can still use ultra quality settings so
anything that there are things in the
ultra quality settings that will put
extra load on the CPU so using
low is not ideal so yeah the reason you
want to test it 720p is because you get
to use those settings but it's less GPU
limited due to low resolution it's
certainly not the Beall or end-all of
predicting future performance so things
like the game engines can start to
utilize the CPUs bear in the future
which may change the swing of things
compared to what we see today that's
certainly likely to happen it's more so
with rise not we saw with the FX
bulldozer series back then because they
were terrible a PC wise and everything
whereas Verizon certainly isn't but
anyway yeah it's not the be-all and
end-all is basically it
720p testing on its own certainly could
be misleading but its world's better
than just doing 4k testing and just
lastly just adding something to that
last minute ideally I would love to
include 720p 1080p 1440p and even 4k
results even though 4k results aren't
really worth including it shows you what
happens at that resolution
I'd love to that in every single video
but for obvious reasons it's just not
possible it takes a huge amount of time
to collect all that data so just doing
one resolution in a ton of games is an
issue so doing three or four is yeah
it's a big deal and I'd like to try and
give you guys a wider spread of games
rather than focusing on just a few
select games and testing so it's a
trade-off you either get a couple of
games and test them thoroughly
or you get a he per games and you test
them sort of in one situation that makes
the most sense so that's why I mostly
stick to tell you pay with ultra quality
settings as I feel like that gives you
sort of the best of both worlds so this
one's from discord as well what do you
prefer for gaming 1440p a hundred Hertz
IPs or 1440p 144 it's plus TN luckily
you actually don't need to choose
between refresh rate and panel quality
at least at 1440p these days there are
IPs VA and TN panels that can all do 144
hurts the ten panels are cheaper so you
know if you're on a budget but you want
that you know those specs just get the
10 panels but if you can afford the the
IPS and VA ones are definitely better so
go for that if I was stuck with
forty-four Hertz on a TN or 1440 a
hundreds to probably choose the higher
refresh it's just always nice to have
okay yeah I like image quality primarily
but yeah if I had to choose out of those
tried to go for the forty or forty p 100
heads for sure all right that that's me
so we're going to wrap up this part of
the Q&amp;amp;A session here once again we
filmed way too many questions to put in
just the one video so we'll have part
two of this Q&amp;amp;A session coming out
tomorrow so stay tuned for that one
