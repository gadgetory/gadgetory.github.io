gamers these days and picking one up
will cost you a pretty penny especially
if you're after the golden standard
Cherry MX switches finding a model
equipped with these switches that's more
than simply bare-bones or attend
careless design under $100 is a hard ask
especially for hoping for something cool
with at least some bells and whistles
well this is exactly the slot that
Cougars attack x3 is trying to fill
coming in at just $90 it's priced very
competitively and can be had in a choice
of all four common cherry switch
varieties blue red black or brown but at
what feature or design expense does this
appealing pricing come out let's take a
closer look and find out the design is
much in line with this bigger brother
the Cougar 600k which I might add had to
be my daily driver for some time it
features almost the same key layout
there's extra functionality in terms of
alternative functions across the F keys
however dedicated brightness windows
lock and media control keys have been
omitted the attack x3 does feature
dedicated volume controls however but
also forgoes the dedicated polling rate
toggles all the kids that are missing
can be found in the affirmation
alternative functions of the F keys
across the top of the keyboard the
layout of the keyboard is standard NSI
aside from the bottom row summing up
honestly was not a fan of its the lack
of a windows key at the bottom left its
instead being replaced with the function
key to activate the top row functions
which is useful I suppose however that
bottom left Windows key is the one I use
religiously is there would be a long and
painful adjustment period for me if I
was gonna start using this keyboard
regularly that's just not something I'd
personally be prepared to do also in
line with the more premium 600 K and 700
K models before it is Kyrgyz brushed
aluminium backing plate which is a nice
touch and a more affordable keyboard I
like the look this gives and with the
keys lit up it offers a nice reflective
globe lighting itself is a bright red
color only and you can switch between
lighting modes with the f4 keys
alternative function
but those they'd like to play around
with outlining configuration there
aren't a ton of options in fact there's
five you can increase decrease the
brightness at 33% intervals set to
breathing or turn the lights completely
off this is pretty basic stuff but
lighting aficionados are probably more
likely to pick up a model with full RGB
lighting anyway and it is a step up from
the limited backlighting of the 600 cave
aside from that the design is rather
basic there's nervous rest or they can
attach one of cougars wrist rests as the
right notches therefore one there are no
buttons along the top shelf either and
in its wrists Restless form this all
results in a relatively small overall
footprint which may appeal to the frugal
traveling accountant gamer who likes to
have their numpad - very sturdy and
rubberized legs give the keyboard
additional lift if you need it aside
from that there isn't much else to say
the overall look and feel the keyboard
exceeds its price point in my opinion if
you'll Salomon you pick it up nothing
rattles the brushed aluminium especially
gives it a nice sleek overall look
probably the only other major feature
I'd missed is having a USB pass-through
this is something I find really useful
but for a lot of people that's not going
to be a deal-breaker the USB cable it
does have is a thick long and braided
one which is a nice touch at this price
point - on the technical side of things
the attack x3 is equipped with
everything pro games would need and
casual noobs like myself don't need but
one for high performance including one
millisecond response time and key
rollover onboard memory to store your
profiles and of course the preferred
Cherry MX switches Cougars uix software
system is lightweight but certainly
powerful enough to suit most gamers the
download weighs in at a bloat free five
point five megabytes and after a quick
installation the attack extreme is
detected immediately within the software
you can quickly set up three different
modes which can be switched between on
the flyer with the function keys
directly on the keyboard itself within
these three modes you can set up and
save different key assignments macros
adjust the polling rate and change the
repeat rate to the lighting controls the
limited as mentioned and you can only
really turn on or off each lighting step
lastly you can also setup different
profiles for specific games and you
which is a good inclusion for the
software overall the cougar attack x3 is
a pretty solid option at its price point
of just $90 obviously the inclusion of
Cherry MX switches is a big plus being
able to get in in each of the four
cherry options is great too for me the
lack of a bottom left Windows key and
USB pass-through was a bummer however I
was impressed with the overall build
quality and look at the keyboard the
Cougar 600k can now be have for just
$97.00 on Amazon and honestly based on
features that would be my preferred
choice although it does forego the full
backlighting for the attack x3 I'll post
the Amazon buy links to both in the
description below let me know what you
think about the attack x3 in the
comments is it one you'll be considering
I'm your host Matt signing off and I'll
see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
