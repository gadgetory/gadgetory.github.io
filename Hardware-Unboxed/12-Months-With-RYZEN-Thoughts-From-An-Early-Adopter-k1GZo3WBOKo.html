roughly a year ago from today that AMD
re-entered the cpu market in a serious
way with Rison and it took the
enthusiast market by storm these new
high-performance chips were so enticing
for productivity workloads that i
decided to do a full system upgrade and
move across to rising from one main
system which i use for video editing and
better gaming you might remember the
build video I did for the system back in
March of 2017
if not you can check it out around here
so I've been using Rison full-time for
basically a year now and before second
gen rising lands in the next month I
wanted to do a recap of a year with
Rison and give my thoughts on being an
early adopter of the platform so first
let's do a quick refresher on the rise
in lineup as it launched throughout 2017
I'm going to ignore the new AP use as
they've only just launched instead
focusing on the pure CPU launches of
2017 so first up we got the 8 core 16
threat Rison seven-line in early march
which offered twice the cause of intel's
then quad-core cable x series and
subsequently impressed with its
productivity performance it's very
similar price points considering all
rise and cpus are unlocked and
overclockable the best option here was
the 329 dollar rise in seven 1700 which
is very easy to overclock up to around 4
gigahertz the Rison 7 1700 X and 1800 X
weren't as good value but that's only
because they were overshadowed by the
1700 in April we got the rise in 5 line
which consisted of the six core 12
thread Rison 5 1600 and 1600 X along
with the four core eight thread Rison 5
1500 X and 1400 again due to the
unlocked nature of all rising cpus the
1600 and 1400 made the most sense
depending on how many cause you needed
and at 170 dollars for the 1400 and 220
for the 1600 these were a really good
value for pretty much everyone and later
in June we got the risin
for inline with four cores and four
threads consisting of the Rison three
1200 and Rison three 1300 X again a bit
of a theme here but the Rison 3 1200 was
a great buy at 110 dollars and could be
overclocked strongly from a value and
performance perspective there were great
buyers across the horizon three rise in
five and rises seven lines and plenty of
reason to choose AMD over Intel's
disappointing cable ache processes this
did change a bit when Intel launched six
core coffee-like CPUs towards the end of
2017 the in-demand Core i5 8400 was a
particularly great option but AMD still
managed to hold their own against the
newer Intel options and this kind of
brings me to my first point about being
a rise an early adopter whenever you
make a purchase like this there is
always the question of whether you
should have just waited for the next big
thing
in this case Intel's coffee Lakeline
which was only six to seven months away
of course with any tech purchase you
could have just waited for something
better but in the case of coffee like
while Intel's new processors were pretty
damn good they didn't make me regret my
rise and purchase at all and this is
because of one simple thing Rison is
still very competitive and a great
all-around cpu particularly the Rison 7
1700 and risin 5 1600 coffee like by no
means boo aimed the out of the water
which is something we haven't been able
to say about the intel AMD rivalry for a
long time had until come out and offered
orders of magnitude more performance
than my rising 7 system I might have
felt a bit of buyer's remorse but that
didn't really happen and ended up still
satisfied with Rison after watching all
of Steve's benchmarked videos and of
course I'd already enjoyed 6 months of
excellent performance before Intel
rejoined the party and I'm really happy
to zng AMD's platform for another key
reason with Rison - just around the
corner I can think about upgrading to a
faster CPU without needing to replace my
motherboard AMD has kept their promise
that all a m4 motherboards will be
compatible with future generation of
CPUs potentially up to 2020 so it's just
a simple matter of a CPU swap if or when
it's worth it to do so had I stuck with
Intel I'd have needed to replace my
motherboard to upgrade to coffee Lake
and a no doubt him to do so again
for the next generation the system I
ended up using was slightly different to
the one in the build video a bit of
production and other reasons that went
into that but the build video showed me
using a risin 7 1700 on a gigabyte a be
350 gaming 3 motherboard but shortly
after we filmed the video we swap that
out for a risin 7 1700 X and Anna soos
ROG crosshair 6 hero X 370 motherboard
we did need to use the 1700 and B
through 50 motherboard for a few other
projects so we made this minor change to
some other stuff we had lying around
this is where the first issue I had with
Rison comes in this is purely down to
being a very early adopter we all heard
about rise in memory issues that
launched with some CPUs and motherboards
doing a rather poor job of supporting
the ddr4 options on the market at the
time you know say for some rise and
approved kits well I got stuck with what
I thought was this problem with my
rising system after swapping to the
crosshair 6 motherboard we used 32 gig
of corsair ddr4 3000 memory with the
original build and it worked fine but
after swapping to the crosshair 6 I
could only get the system working with 2
of the 4 8 gig modules in stores and
only a 2666 beds rather than the 29:33
that should have easily worked I thought
this was down to the memory issues we'd
heard about I did decide to wait for a
few buyers and system updates to see if
they would resolve the issue and these
fixes did allow me to push up the memory
speeds to 29 33 but I still couldn't get
the full 32 gig working so obviously
alarms going off there but as it turns
out the crosshair 6 euro motherboard
provided to us by AMD and this was the
original motherboard provided to us
alongside Rison 7 for our initial review
that had to faulty DIMM slots it wasn't
a memory compatibility or BIOS issue at
all rather a problem with the first
batch of motherboards I subsequently
swapped back to the gigabyte a be 350
gaming 3 and I haven't had a problem
since and this is one of the problems
with being an early adopter in the first
few months of Rison it did take a couple
of months for BIOS and AMD platform
updates to sort out the memory
compatibility issues and the very first
run of motherboards also had a couple of
issues
motherboard manufacturers didn't have
much time to get out products for the
Rison 7 launch and of course we were
looking at an entirely new platform so
there were going to be a few issues
around that sort of launch
unfortunately early adopters had to bear
the brunt of these issues and that
really should have been fixed pre-launch
but since those issues in the early days
I've had basically no problems with the
platform as for overclocking I've been
comfortably running at 3.9 gigahertz on
my rise in seven 1700 X since launch my
CPU can't quite hit four gigahertz at
sensible voltages but I hear most 1700
X's and 1700 s can I'm still quite
satisfied with 3.9 gigahertz anyway and
I could achieve this overclock on both
the X 370 crosshair 6 hero and the be
350 gigabyte a be 350 gaming 3 which is
nice considering the be 350 board is a
hell of a lot cheaper it's only $90
rather than $250 for the Zeus X 370
option so provided you don't choose a
board with terrible V RMS or vrm cooling
it sounds like a lot of be 350 boards
are great for overclocking even the
top-end rise and 7 CPUs and that's
certainly been my experience another
concern that arose around launch was
rising single thread performance which
is behind Intel and not exactly helped
by Verizon's inability to clock higher
than around 4.2 gigahertz in the best
case situations admittedly I did think
this may be somewhat of an issue when I
upgraded to rise in but after a year
using the CPU everyday it's just not a
big deal at all most of the tasks I do
for work which involve video editing and
rendering in premiere basic web browsing
document creation and Excel spreadsheet
work there either all fully
multi-threaded and make use of rise in
the 7s 8 cause or happen fast enough
that additional single Turner
performance would make a negligible
difference in fact the main tasks I
perform in my PC that involves a lot of
waiting for things to complete is video
rendering which is fully multi-threaded
and completes
faster than an equivalently priced Intel
system there just aren't that many
day-to-day single threaded workloads I
use which makes rise in this slightly
inferior single thread performance
pretty much a non-issue you definitely
couldn't say this a few years back when
multi-threaded was a less common thing
but
these days single thorough tasks are
truly on their way out now of course if
Rison was significantly behind Intel in
single photo performance like they used
to be with bulldozer it would definitely
would be an issue and would harm
multi-threaded tasks in the process but
Rison gets close enough for me it's
going to be similar for most other
buyers out there plus I'm really
enjoying having eight cores it's awesome
for multitasking the other big story at
the launch of Rison was in gaming
performance when testing CPU limited
gaming at 720p or 1080p Rison 7 was
often a fair way behind intel's kb lake
in popular tiles and this caused a lot
of concern among buyers definitely a lot
of discussion on our videos Rison was a
great value proposition for productivity
but gaming performance was disappointing
and not that attractive to those
building a pure gaming system in 2018
this is still somewhat the case the core
i7 8700 K for example still holds a
pretty solid lead over the horizon 7
1800 X in most games despite the 1,800 X
outperforming the 8700 K in the number
of multi-threaded productivity tests
however the gap between AMD and Intel in
games has closed a little bit since
launch what used to be a significant gap
at 1080p with something you know like a
gtx 1080i has shrunk a bit there's still
a gap that gives the AO 700k a lead but
it's not the surprisingly large
discrepancy it once was and this is down
to a few things
games are becoming more multi-threaded
so titles released since the launch of
Rison are more likely to support Rises
capabilities properly and more likely to
use more threads again the Intel does
still hold a lead with a lot of modern
games but we are seeing a trend of the
gap narrowing and while very few older
games received updates to help rise and
performance more general updates to the
platform drivers BIOS and windows and so
forth have assisted gaming performance
to a small degree it's not a game
changer but it has helped the situation
since launch and to be honest the whole
situation of Intel leading in gaming
performance only applies to a subsection
of the gaming population those that game
at 1080p or lower with the high end GPU
like a gtx 1080i if you are GPU limited
either through using a lower
jeepers you all gaming at a higher
resolution there was very little
difference in performance between coffee
lake and risin at least for gaming in
2018 in the future it might be a little
different as games to become more CPU
limited but right now you need to have a
specific Hardware set up to benefit from
Intel's gaming performance lead and
that's sort of where my experiences with
rising for gaming come in I have a tight
next Pascal but I game at 34 40 by 1440
so in basically every game I'm GPU
limited with this sort of syrup Rison
has been fantastic for gaming I've had
no issues and in general I'm not missing
out on any extra performance that
otherwise have from a coffee like system
so even though I was a bit concerned
when I first saw rise ins gaming
benchmarks in actual practice with my
setup I've had no issues so overall I've
been really happy with my riser system
it's been a great choice for video
editing and day to day work and it's
been very capable for high-end gaming
aside from a few early adopter teething
issues in the first few months it's been
smooth sailing since then I'm looking
forward to seeing what 2nd gen Rison
brings next month I think a lot of the
earlier doctor problems with the rising
platform have been largely resolved and
I'll have no trouble recommending Rison
to buyers right now especially is it you
know it continues to be good value for
money for productivity and gaming
workloads compared to Intel's offerings
though I guess at this point you should
probably wait for rise until you see
what that's like anyway that's it for
this recap of Rison after 12 months if
you've been using rising - I'd love to
hear your thoughts in the comments below
about how it's been going for you don't
forget to smash the like button and I'll
catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
