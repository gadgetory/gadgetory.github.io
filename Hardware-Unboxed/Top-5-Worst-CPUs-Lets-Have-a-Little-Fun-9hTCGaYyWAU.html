about two months ago now I put together
a top 5 best CPUs video and this was
just before horizon 3 and thread Ripper
landed anyway most of the pics they're
still pretty valid today so I'm not
going to bother updating that video just
yet
instead we're gonna have a little bit of
fun and look at what the top 5 worst
CPUs released in the last five years or
so looks like now in the previous video
I did mention this was something I was
thinking of doing and a lot of you have
been begging me to do it ever since oh
it's taken so long but a lot of you gave
your top 5 worst CPU lists on the last
video so I'm going to sort of
collaborate with you guys to blend your
top 5 worst with my top 5 worst I
thought you guys might get a little bit
excited about a top 5 worst series um
but I have to say the feedback was even
more than I was expecting so I have
taken everyone's picks on board and
looked at which models came up the most
I'll then put my own spin on it to
justify the picks as I see it I remember
this is just a little bit of fun and if
you've got one of these CPUs or whatever
don't be offended we're just having a
bit of fun here we're not saying you're
stupid or anything like that by buying
one of these CPUs I'm sure you have your
own reasons and you may have got them
for a good price at the time like I said
just a bit of fun so remember that as we
go through the piece
all of these pics will no doubt be
controversial for one reason or another
and I have to say though this one will
probably stir up more comments than
let's say some of the other ones from a
technical standpoint the core i7 69 50x
was a bit of a Marvel which makes it a
bit strange to be on this list and at
the time of release it was the most
powerful CPU you could possibly buy
Desktop CPU that is and it didn't just
smash productivity work idea that it was
very capable when it came to gaming in
terms of performance it had no weakness
power consumption was very reasonable
for a 10 chord 20 thread CPU and while
not the best overclocker again for a 10
core part it was impressive all sounds
good so far the issue however was the
price Intel's previous generation
flagship CPU released 2 years prior cost
$1000 us after a reasonably long wait
these six no 50x landed for an insane
seventeen hundred and fifty dollars us
enthusiasts were all like please Intel
I've saved up $1,000 us it took me two
years can I at least have the flagship
version this insane price gouging
certainly wrapped the PC tech community
the wrong way and it was quite clear at
this point Intel was taking advantage of
its market dominance this is what a lack
of competition leads to and this is why
fan blowing for a certain company is
just stupid they don't care about you
the consumer they only care about profit
margins and the 69 50 X was a rude
reminder of that
moving on from taking advantage of
enthusiasts with deep pockets Intel's
now just decided to confuse the hell out
of all of us by releasing a quad-core
CPU actually not one but two quad-core
CPUs on their high-end desktop platform
what is this 2013 because that's the
last time we saw a quad-core CPU and
Intel's premium desktop platform I'm not
even sure if it made sense then here we
are thinking the arrival of Verizon
would force Intel finally started
increasing core counts in a meaningful
way if I go and do this after the
world's tech media put their heads
together and tried to work out why KB
like X was even a thing
I mean we only just worked out KB like
at least I think we did and now we have
an even more confusing Lake to navigate
anyway I don't think anyone really
worked out the KB like X riddle and from
what I've heard from retailers it seems
like consumers didn't get it either
quite interestingly looking at Amazon's
best sellers list for CPUs I found the
core i7 7740 X in 44th spot as I put
this video together the list is updated
every hour but deham 44th position
shockingly Amazon is still selling more
AMD FX processors ouch
I am proud though to see the core i7
7800 X 78 20x and 7900 X all ranked
higher so it's good to see consumers
doing their homework anyway I don't feel
like I really need to justify why the
cabe you like X CPUs made this list I
think you guys get it
next to the AMD FX series the most
heavily nominated worst cpu was the
Intel Core i3 73 50k and I have to admit
I was a bit hesitant to include this one
yes in terms of price versus performance
it makes absolutely no sense at all even
at the new $140 u.s. price though
admittedly
it is now world's better than that 170
dollar MSRP even so in order to actually
take advantage of the 7350 case unlocked
clock multiplier you need to purchase an
expensive Zed Series motherboard and
don't forget it also doesn't come with a
cooler a cooler alone adds at least
$20.00 to the asking price so we're back
to 160 dollars u.s. and we still need a
motherboard that supports overclocking
so once you factor in all the additional
costs you essentially end up with a
really expensive dual-core that's more
than twice the price of the G 45 60
that's really not a great deal faster
still the KB Lake architecture is very
good so in terms of performance and
efficiency the 73 50k isn't bad that for
me makes it a bit of an iffy choice for
the top 5 worst CPUs but with nearly
everyone nominating in the previous
video I couldn't really skip over it
either
yeah well come on you knew this one was
coming I don't think there's many of you
that will try and dispute this one even
the most hard and battle-ready AMD
fanboys have to give up this fight at
least now come on it's 2017 admit defeat
you've got rise in a rally behind come
on the FX series sucked from the release
of the fx-8150 back in 2011 to the
motherboard fry FX 95 90 in 2014 the FX
series has sucked worse than any cpu I
can remember in the last decade from day
one the FX series proved to be about as
efficient as a hybrid era Honda powered
f1 and there were endless FX owners
sitting back in lawn chairs waiting for
their games to load up the only option
here for AMD was to reduce prices so low
they'd lose sight of what it even looked
like to break-even frankly you were
better off buying a core i3 from about
2013 onwards as someone who truly
cherishes competition in the tech
industry I can't tell you how thankful I
am that these days are well behind us
now
I just hope AMD can continue to make
good steps with the Zen architecture
build is a low-powered eight core cpu
the FX 83-70 ii was anything but out of
the box it used well over 50 percent
more power than an equivalent has well
based Core i5 of the time and at best
was able to match it for productivity
workloads then when it came to gaming
even when overclocked beyond 4.5
gigahertz the 83-70 would get blasted by
the core i5 4430 II and it really
struggled to keep up with core i3 CPUs
hmm the only saving grace was the core
i3 like asking price of 142 dollars for
the 8320 II though the 83-70 that I'm
focused on still costs a ridiculous 194
dollars u.s. in my opinion the e series
of FX processors was a desperate move in
late 2014 to try and move some inventory
looking back if you're invested in FX
83-70 $494 and 2014 or a core i5 46 70 K
for two hundred and forty-two dollars
that extra $50 meant three years later
in 2017 you'd still have a very capable
gaming system that's not really in need
of an upgrade meanwhile the FX 83-70
would be plaguing you with horrible 1%
lower performance in many modern titles
and you're probably having a bit of a
bad time in comparison okay so I did
pick two AMD FX processors to rag on but
really the FX 95 19 FX 83-78 represent
the entire FX series on a whole aimed it
really sold the bet on that one
then admittedly the core i3 73 50k is a
bit of a sketchy pick but with KB Lake
offering zero improvement over skylake
in terms of IPC gains Intel still
insisting on using a rubbish Tim on
their premium unlocked models and the
fact that it took them this long to
offer another sub $200 us part I can't
see there being too many enthusiasts
having an issue with this one
meanwhile the core i7 77 40 X and Core
i5 70 640 x aka crappy Lake are an
obvious and well deserved pick and well
I'm never gonna forgive Intel for the
core i7 69 50 X pricing and
review Atlit that awarded both the AI
777 40 X and i-76 950 X scores in excess
of 90% probably need to have a long hard
look at themselves but hey we all make
mistakes anyway guys you've been
hounding me for this one so hopefully it
was everything you hoped it would be of
course remember this is just a bit of
fun and while mostly fact-based it was
also just my opinion and those in the
comment section from the previous video
just sort of all rolled into one beer
above all else just a bit of fun
on that note if you happen to have a
computer with an older CPU maybe an FX
processor and you want to have it up
rather than check out a new upgrade my
PC plea series first episode will be
online this time tomorrow and we're set
to give whoever is voted the most
deserving a $500 us upgrade package for
their PC so that's gonna be pretty
exciting anyway
I'm your host Steve catch again soon
