we're taking a glimpse into the future
to see how rise in three will perform
when it's released next week now you
might be thinking why not just wait a
week and test it then well honestly this
is probably what I would have done but I
spent the last week gathering all the
results I've done quite a bit of testing
and it wasn't till last Friday that AMD
officially announced the release date
and quite a few details so I knew the
Rossum 3 release wasn't that far away I
just didn't realize it wasn't that far
away anyway I did the same thing just
before rising 5 was released and those
results turned out to be 100% accurate
which is pretty unsurprising because
risin 5 and now rising 3 are the same
physical chips as risin 7 just with a
certain degree of resources disabled I
explained why this is in a bit more
detail on the horizon 5 simulated
benchmark video so I won't go all over
that stuff again but basically when an
eight-core CPU fails the quality control
check with one or more caused the
defective cause are then shut off and
the chip is bent as a lower end part AMD
has likely been holding up releasing
horizon 3 until they have enough
defective CPUs that can't be sold as
Rison 5 models basically rising 3 is
very similar to rising 5 horizon 5 1400
should say with one key difference being
the SMT support is now disabled for
those of you that don't know SMT is
basically a embiez version of Intel
hyper-threading this means whereas the
1400 has four cores and eight threads
all Verizon 3 CPUs will come with 4
cores but just four threads and again
it's due to the lack of the SMT support
life for 1400 the Rison 3 1300 X and
1200 will feature 8 mega byte level 3
cache support for dual channel ddr3 666
memory and will be given a 65 watt TDP
rating the Rison 3 specs are set in
concrete now the 1300 X will operate at
a base frequency of 3.5 gigahertz with a
bruise frequency of 3.7 gigahertz while
the slightly lower end 1200 will operate
at 3.1 gigahertz with a boost frequency
of 3.4 gigahertz both are unlocked parts
for and through this on a budget it
makes a little sense to what for the
more expensive 1300 X the 1300 X is
suggested or rather rumored at this
point to be priced at 130 dollars us
while the 1200 is set to come in at just
a hundred and ten dollars us saving $40
by purchasing the r3 1300 x over the r5
1400 probably won't be worth it that
said though the $60 saving offered by
the r3 1200 should be a lot more
enticing the question is how much slower
does disabling SMT make rise and three
and how do they compare with similarly
priced Intel CPUs actually comparing
rise and three with equivalent Intel
CPUs at these price points is a little
tricky because the Intel CPUs here make
no sense whatsoever as I've touched on
numerous times in the past the Pentium G
4560 eliminates everything right up to
the core i5 7400 that means everything
price between $64 us and $180 us is
completely pointless ruling out Intel's
entire cable 8 core i3 range and again
this place the rise in three CPUs in an
awkward spot at 110 and 130 dollars us
that said if they can take it to the
locked core i5 part such as a 70 470 500
then they will event themselves a
comfortable position in the market
segment so without wasting any more time
let's see how the rising 3c if you use
look as we take the rise in 5 1400
disable SMT and adjust the boost and
base clock speeds accordingly starting
off I took a look at the memory balance
performance just to make sure everything
was in check here as expected disabling
SMT support had no impact on memory
balance and when paired with ddr4 29:33
memory the rise in three processors
should enjoy a bandwidth of 35 gigabytes
per second please note that I did not
for 2933 memory here opposed to 3200 for
the simple fact that some of our lower
end rising 5cp us still have trouble
running higher clocked memory so I'm
going to assume motorized in 3 CPUs will
as well for measuring single and multi
traded rendering performance we have
Cinebench r15 and here the rise and 3
processors stack up rather well the
single thread performance of the 1300 X
is just 5% down on the core i5 7500
while the multitrader performance is 9%
lower that said keep in mind that both
the 1200 and 1300 X will be fully
unlocked so chances are with a little
bit of tinkering you can put both well
head of the i-5 7500 and this test
before physical cause of the rise and
three CPUs are able to match the two
much higher clocked and hyper threading
enabled core i3 70 350 K cause in the
7-zip file manager benchmark again the
r3 1300 X wasn't that much slower than
the more expensive i-5 7500 well both
easily beat the pentium g 45 60 though
that is a much cheaper cpu moving the
excel workload I have to admit I was
expecting the rise in three CPUs to
perform much better here dropping SMT
support along with lower operating
frequencies and a reduction the level 3
cache capacity has more than half the
performance from the 1500 X they also
come in well behind the i3 73 50k and
miles behind the i5 7500 the r3 1200 for
example was only able to match the
pentium g 45 60 in its out-of-the-box
spec for general usage the Rison 3 CPU
should be comparable to the pentium g 45
60 and Core i5 7500 and while we're
certainly seeing this in the PC mark 10
essentials benchmark the only issue here
for the rise in 3 CPS is the operating
clock speed overclocked them a little
and they will no doubt match the i5 7500
the productivity numbers are pretty much
what we were expecting given the r5 1500
X's performance also given the core i3
7350 K can be seen beating the core i5
7500 in the spreadsheets test and almost
matching it for the writing test it's
clear to say this benchmark favor single
thread performance horizon 3 CPUs scored
very well in the photo editing test
crushing the dual core Intel CPUs while
roughly matching the core i5 7500 that
said the rendering and visualization
performance was lower than expected here
the r3 1300 X roughly matched the i3 73
50k then finally for video editing the
rise and three processes find themselves
situated between the Pentium D 45 60 and
Core i5 7500
certainly not a bad result but again
this test prefers clock speed over core
count I had expected the rise in three
CPUs to knock off the core i3 73 50k in
the corona benchmark but it wasn't to be
the r3 3900 X was still 7% slower and
16% slower than the i5 7500 the pentium
g 45 60 was also surprisingly slow in
this test a very slow in fact given its
just 17 percent lower than the 73 50k
yeah it was a little over 40 percent
slower this doesn't really make sense
until you account for the fact that it
does also have 25 percent less bandwidth
at its disposal so those two
shortcomings combined have led to the G
45 sixties downfall in this test the G
45 60 also gets trashed in the blender
render test though this time the Rison 3
cpus look a lot more competitive as the
R 3 1200 match the 73 50k while the r3
1300 X edged ahead given up the risin 5
1500 X is slightly sold me I 570 500 and
a handbrake test I wasn't expecting the
SMT disabled Rison 3 to do well that's
that they do manage to edge out the core
I 373 50k and through overclocking
should come quite close to matching the
7500 for content creators on a budget
the Rison 3 CPUs look to be a godsend
the r3 1300 match the i5 7500 and of
course it does so at a much more
affordable price and again it can be
overclocked for even greater performance
the same is of course also true for the
r3 1200 when it comes to gaming
performance the Rison 3 CPUs look as
though they provide decent performance
for a mid-range GPU as they maintain
well over 60 FPS at all times in our
battlefield 1 benchmark performance was
comparable to the core i3 73 50k in this
title though it was a good bit slower
than the core i5 7500 much the same as
seen when testing with mafia 3 horizon 3
1200 and 1300 ex struggle against the
core i3 73 50k though they are clearly
faster than the Pentium G 45 60 again
decent performance here for those
wanting to use a mid-range graphics card
but for anything faster than the gtx
1070 some serious overclocking will be
required
moving over to hitman we do see much
more competitive performance from the
rising three CPUs in fact here the r3
1300 X is able to match the core i5 7500
it's also not a great deal slower than
the r5 1500 X so overclocking the
horizon three CPUs will bring them right
into play here finally we have ashes of
the singularity and this time the rise
in three 1300 X is only able to match
the core i3 73 50k with an average of 61
fps and this makes it quite a bit slower
than the core i5 7500 a bit of a
disappointing result but again whereas
the i5 7,500 is limited to the
performance
here it will be possible to squeeze more
frames out of the rise in three CPUs
throughout the clocking power
consumption is about we'd expect it to
be the rise in three 13-hundred should
consume around the same amount of power
as the core i5 7500 keep in mind that we
are testing with a high index 370 system
with a liquid cooling pump and all that
other extreme gear and expect with a
high-end rig so in a lower spec system
you will see better numbers so again
keep that in mind taking a final look at
power consumption we have the figures
from the Cinebench r15 multi-threaded
test and here the rise and three CPUs
look a little more hungry than the core
i5 7500 though the numbers are hardly
extreme and this is just a simulated
benchmark okay so based on the simulated
benchmarks Rison 3 certainly looks as
though it's going to be very competitive
that said though as you might expect
when compared to Intel processors or the
Intel competition
AMD came out on top in some of the tests
while the core i3 73 50k and Core i5
7500 pulled ahead and others anyway
let's take a quick look at a few price
versus performance scatter plots as we
saw previously bang for your buck
the rosen 3 CPUs really deliver when
working with Premiere Pro CC they might
not be the fastest CPUs after all both
were slightly sold in the core i5 7500
but given their price the performance
scene is commendable horizon 3 CPUs also
deliver a reasonable value and handbrake
the r3 1300 X for example should be
slightly more affordable than the i3 73
50k while it delivers slightly better
performance
meanwhile the r3 1200 is a good bit
cheaper and it's also again slightly
faster again the Rison 3 CPUs do
reasonably well in the 7-zip test edging
out the core i3 73 50k that said you do
get 80% greater performance with the r5
1,500 X when compared to the r3 1300 x4
just a 46% increase in price and of
course when taking the overall platform
cost into account the percentage will be
even lower when it comes to gaming rise
and 3 is going to be a mixed bag that
said there was a mid-range graphics card
at the r3 1,300 X and 1200 will deliver
the same performance as the r5 1500 X
and Core i5 7500 for the most part so
it's a bit of a non-issue
that said that with a powerful GPU such
as the extremely overkill GTX 1080i
we see
that for hitman the rising three CPUs do
trail the core i3 7350 K at this point I
would just like to note that for my
official horizon three benchmark video I
will be including a good range graphics
card in the testing anyway moving on
testing with battlefield 1 shows that
the Rison 3 1300 X and core i3 70-degree
50k to be on par in terms of performance
however as we do expect the rise in CP
to be more affordable therefore it
should present better value again though
the r5 1500 X does represent
considerably better value when compared
with a high end GPU alright so now we
have a pretty good idea of how the
horizon 3 CPUs are going to perform and
I'm extremely confident of the accuracy
of the numbers just shown overall the
performance was pretty much as expected
I guess depending on how you look at it
and that's both a good and bad thing
from these more affordable quad-core
processors for now let's ignore the rest
of Amy's own lineup and instead focus
solely on the competing Intel chips in
terms of value rise and 3 certainly
looks to have the locked core i5s well
and truly beaten especially if you take
overclocking into account which we
haven't done here yet anyway you can
safely assume that will be possible to
boost the performance of these rather
than three CPUs by at least 10% I'd say
they'd probably be more likely around
15% so the r3 1300 X and 1200 are the
obvious choice over the dual core core
i3
7350 K that said though that was a CPU
no one should have been buying anyway at
$150 u.s. and this is kind of the
problem rising three phases while
superior in terms of value it's pretty
much beating and already begging line up
even today in mid 2017 if you want to
build an affordable brand new computer
the pentium g 45 60 still puts forward a
very strong case it enables playable
performance and the latest titles using
an entry level or mid-range graphics
card and it's extremely efficient
going beyond intel's pentium g 4560 i'd
say that the horizon 5 1400 / 1500 x
seemed like the obvious choice and yet
if you're really serious about your pc
just save up a little extra cash and get
the 6 core r5 1600 and call it a day for
example if you went with the cheapest
possible gaming rig build with a basic
be 350 board 8 gigabytes of ddr4 memory
a cheap case and power supply combo say
the geforce gtx
ten fifty and a 500 gigabyte Seagate
Fire Korea for example you'd save just
18% on the entire system build cost by
opting for the r3 1200 over the r5 1600
so think about that for a moment
basically you're getting half as much
level three cache two less cores and ate
less threads also for those of you
wondering the same system would be just
10% cheaper with the r3 1200 approached
the SMT enabled r5 1400 so again
spending a little more does seem to get
you a lot more in this case still if
you're hell-bent on spending as little
as possible the horizon 3 1200 it's just
a hundred and ten dollars u.s. is a
super chip things like overclocking
particularly with the stock cooler or
what I want to explore in next week's
video and that will tell us if the 1200
is indeed worth buying over Intel's g45
60 I'm also assuming that the budget
orientated race stealth will be included
with these CPUs speaking of the G 45 60
there is a rumor going around the moment
that Intel is discontinuing that CPU or
at least making it difficult to buy
which it has been for quite a while in
the u.s. right now Australia you can buy
the chip quite easily um they're very
well priced very competitively priced in
fact but yeah availability over in the
US has been very poor that could be down
to the extreme demand or it could be
down to Intel playing a bit of funny
buggers wrapping things up I'd say that
the biggest problem for Verizon 3 is
AMD's own rise and 5 line up it's just
so strong in terms of value and that is
going to make it difficult for Rison to
really compete in my opinion still I
feel like if most are three 1200 chips
can overclock to a reasonable frequency
using the Box cooler then that would
indeed make them very enticing whatever
way you look at though I think it's fair
to say that Intel's mid-range lineup is
already dead so at least rising 3 is won
that battle of course the benchmark
shown in this video are simulated and
the pricing is estimated so I'll have to
wait til rise and three arrives next
week before we can deliver any real
concrete information that said I do
believe this video to be accurate my
rising fire simulated video was spot-on
so I think no reason why we should
differ for those holding out for Aizen 3
I hope this video has been useful and
perhaps you should just pull the trigger
on an r5 1400
more preferably the 1600 if you can
stretch the budget that far that's going
to do it for this one if you liked this
