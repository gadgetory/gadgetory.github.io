recently I checked out the vrm design
and thermal performance of our number of
high ends in 390 motherboards or priced
around $300 us now of the bunch the
gigabyte is at 390 horas Master
impressed me the most as Rox said 390
Taichi ultimate was also quite good
MSI's meg z2 390 ace that was a little
bit lackluster still a good board but
didn't impress me as much as I thought
having come from the godlike and then we
had the Oh Suze ROG Maximus 11 hero
which also disappointed me a bit based
on the results seen from previous
assumed other wards the Maximus 11 hero
was the worst performer of that
comparison the thermals weren't horrible
but the well given the price I suppose
the performance was quite disappointing
and then there was the whole issue with
is it an eight phase-- or is it a four
phase motherboard turns out it is a four
phase with double components so still
quite a powerful vrm though because of
the design it did run a bit hotter than
expected seuss have their reasons for
why they've gone with that particular
design they believe it is better so
that's something we have to dig into in
the future but yeah that's that at the
moment a sous have said it was a mistake
that it was advertised as an 8 + 2 + 2
phase vrm in the US that was a mistake
by the US marketing team so they're now
rectifying that and once they do
hopefully I can get an official
statement for them and I'll pin that on
the previous video and that will
hopefully put it into that issue and
hopefully we don't see any twin 8 phase
marketing BS from a sous in the future
anyway with the mystery of the twin 8
phase erm mostly solved we can move on
to some more testing and I do plan to
test pretty much every single Zed 3 and
on your motherboard at least every
single one I can get my hands on a few
of you have requested we test out the
EVGA models unfortunately we don't
really get EVGA here in Australia and
despite the fact that about 40% of our
viewership do come from the u.s. EVGA
don't seem that interested in sampling
us so maybe we can convince them in the
future
but as of now or for now we've only got
the four main brands that we're going to
be checking out so on hand we have the
asrock zed 390 pro 4 this is a 130
dollar US model and I have taken all
their heat sinks off the boards and have
them putting them back or haven't put
them back for this part of the video so
you're seeing the boards mostly naked
doesn't really matter I suppose next up
we have actually will go to where we got
the MSI board let's go with that as next
because that's also $130 u.s. so I'll do
them in order of price actually I'm not
doing them in order a price scrap that
anyway but the msi board next said 390
pro note said 390 a pro that's that
board $130 then we got the cheaper sport
here the gigabyte Zed 390 UD looks to be
one of the better boards of the bunch
again no heat sinks on it but yeah 120
dollars seems like a pretty good buy
that $120 and then the most expensive of
them all the asou prime Z 390 P now a
sous well this is an entry-level board
they don't seem to do entry-level
pricing quite like the other three
brands and therefore this is a 150
dollar US motherboard so quite expensive
for what it is but we'll get to the
results in a moment now you might be
thinking who's gonna pair a sub $150
u.s. motherboard with a $500 plus us
core I know and processor and well
that's fair enough
I'd say anyone buying or at least trying
to buy a brand-new 1900 K processor
today isn't going to pair it with a
board price south of $200 u.s. however
what if you've only got the budget for a
core i5 r i3 processor today an
affordable Zed 390 board with basic
features seems like a reasonable
solution and it should mean in a year or
two you can pick up a 90 under okay on
the sale or secondhand and slot that
into your existing is that 390
motherboard this is a fairly common
scenario people buy what they can afford
now in the hope that they can max it out
and upgrade in the future without having
to upgrade their entire system
after all the four entry-level
motherboards that we're looking at today
all
officially support the 99er okay so it's
not unreasonable to expect that some
users might eventually end up using this
processor on one of these motherboards
question is how well do they support the
power-hungry eight core processor before
we get to the results let's just quickly
go over each board starting with the
gigabyte Zed 390 UD this board uses the
ISL six nine one three eight controller
and from it five pwm signals are
outputted for the vcore these signals
are then each doubled using the ISL six
six one seven phase doubler giving us
ten phases for the high side MOSFETs we
have on semiconductors for C ten N and
on the low side for C 0 6 n cooling the
board's vrm are a pair of reasonably
large anodized black aluminum heat sinks
that properly finned but they aren't
just aluminium blocks either and both
are secured to the PCB using plastic
push pin clips next up we have the
asrock z3 90 pro 4 and this board uses
the up9 5 to 1p phase controller though
this time we have just four pwo signals
for the vcore though each is again
doubled this time using U P 1961 s phase
SS giving us eight phases in total as
for the MOSFETs
on the high side we have so no power SM
4337 and on the low side SM 43:36
so not a bad configuration for a budget
board though you do still need to cool
at nazarov seems to have forgotten that
little factors they've stuck on these
smallest heatsink you're likely ever to
find on his m390 motherboard I reckon
the Intel IHS would have done a better
job of calling these MOSFETs the
heatsink weighs in at just 24 grams and
that's pretty pathetic considering
gigabyte swacked 108 grams worth of
heatsink on their entry levels at 390
board next up we have their sous Prime
at 0 90 P and things don't look that
much better here sure we've got some
heat sinks both much bigger and combined
tip the scales at 57 grams but the vrm
design itself is it's pretty rubbish as
usual as sousou's using their rebranded
asp 1,400 c TB controller and as usual
at least for the majority of their said
390 range they're taking just four PWM
signals and they aren't doubling them so
then we have a four phase
with a doubling of components like
gigabyte they are using on
semiconductors 4 C 10 n for the higher
side and therefore C 0 6 and for the low
side there's just less of them in total
and not even half as many phases given
that this is by far the most expensive
of the entry-level boards just say that
I'm disappointed with what Asus are
offering here
doesn't really cut it anyway lucky last
we have the MSI z3 9 ta Prohm this is a
pretty nice looking board on the surface
we get a nice big heat sink over the V
chord vrm this monster weighs you know
170 grams so it is the biggest heatsink
of all the entry levels at 390
motherboards that said the vrm itself
isn't super impressive like asrock msi
is using the U P 9521 P phase controller
and they are also taking just four PWM
signals
however unlike asrock they aren't
doubling them so this is another for
phase V core vrm on the high side we
have a pair of SM 4337 FETs on the low
side two sm 4503 FETs so it'll be
interesting to see how this motherboard
performs ok so that's how the boards
compare on paper I'm just quickly before
we get into the results if you would
like to know exactly how I've tested
these boards in each configuration
please watch the previous video in this
series I'll provide a link in the video
description it'll probably be a
timestamp to where I actually explain
how I test on the testbed and inside the
case but I won't go over all that here
like I said I'll just put the link as it
takes me quite a few minutes to get
through all that so we'll skip that and
we'll get straight into the results so
again if you want to know about that
check the link in the video description
ok so here are these stock 9900 k
results with the board's installed
inside the Corsair crystal 570 X with
plenty of fans and direct airflow over
the vrm all testing has been conducted
with an ambient air temperature between
21 and 22 degrees thermals have been
measured using k-type thermocouple ZAR
measuring the MOSFET surface temperature
labeled as top as well as the underside
of the PCB and please note the internal
mosfet temperatures are at least 10
degrees higher usually around 20 degrees
higher so there is quite a difference
there however we don't use the readouts
from stuff like hardware info because
well some of these boards
give you that information and it's not
always accurate there's offsets and
things like that so it's not a great way
of comparing motherboards anyway keeping
the internal temperature in mind which
will be higher you really want to keep
the surface temperature below 80 to 85
degrees as that would mean an internal
temperature around 100 degrees these
components are usually rated to handle
up to 125 degrees but that's the thermal
cutoff and you'll want to stay well away
from that efficiency is also very poor
at those temperatures you're basically
killing the components and well
degradation is rapidly accelerated
please note there are two test
configurations for the gigabyte is Ed
390 UD as this board seems to over volt
the 1900 K quite badly with the current
f3 bias that we use for testing despite
being the best board on paper with what
looks to be the best or close to the
best cooling and actually provided the
worst results however during the test
I noticed the 99 okay was being fed one
point three eight volts which is far too
much even for a 5 gigahertz all core
overclock I have notified gigabyte of
this issue and in the meantime I've set
the voltage at one point to 6 volts to
match the Isuzu Prime the M result
though under load was about 1.2 to 5
volts the MSI asrock boards ran between
one point two eight and one point two
eight eight volts which is a bit higher
but that's what they do on auto anyway
we should probably just discuss the
results so the lowest peak MOSFET
surface temperature was recorded on the
MSI Zed 390 a pro and just 52 degrees
that said the back side of the PCB hits
75 degrees which is certainly getting up
there the reason for the huge variation
is due to the fact that MSI boards have
a massive heatsink that does a really
good job of removing heat from the
surface of the FETs especially when
there's plenty of airflow to capture
however because the MSI board only uses
a four phase veeram the components do
generate quite a bit of heat and that's
absorbed through the PCB and then isn't
dissipated very well and therefore
builds up to around 75 degrees the
result you see here now the gigabyte Z
390 UD dropped an incredible 20 degrees
when running the 1900 K at one point two
to five volts opposed to the one point
three eight volts and this 11 percent
reduction in voltage has a profound
impact on how hot the very
gets so while the gigabyte board is a
poor performer right now they should be
able to address this with a future BIOS
and that will make it one of the best
although the MOSFET surface temperature
was 9 degrees hotter than what we saw in
the MSI board the pc temperature was 11
degrees cooler and that is very
significant the asustor primes at 390 P
does reasonably well in this test with
MOSFET surface temperatures climbing
just a few degrees higher than the
gigabyte model though the PCB
temperature was 10 degrees hotter then
we have the asrock Zed 390 pro 4 which
quite frankly sucked the vrm design as
we saw earlier isn't bad but the tiny
little 24 gram heatsink is a complete
joke we're seeing surface temperatures
around 80 degrees and although this
board it doesn't report vrm temperatures
I suspect the internal temperature is up
around 100 degrees so that's basically a
fail in my book we've got a stock 99
Enrique in a well ventilated case in a
cool room and the vrm temp using k-type
thermocouple is reaching 80 degrees the
results you see here are reported after
the load test I give the board's 10
minutes to cool down and then I report
the current temperature the MSI Zed 390
a pro cools down the best likely thanks
to its massive heatsink and we also saw
the PC temps came right down as well
then with a bit of voltage tuning we set
the gigabyte board also comes down to a
similar temperature to that of their
sous and as ROC models that said stock
using the f3 bias had only cooled down
to around 40 degrees okay here are the
test bench results with no direct
airflow and you might be wondering what
all those red bars are about basically
these indicate invalid results the MSI
asrock and our sous boards all suffered
varam throttling which down clocked the
1900 K from 4.7 gigahertz to around 4.2
gigahertz the Isuzu Prime's ed 390 P
began throttling after 6 minutes at
which point it had already reached a
MOSFET surface temperature of 100
degrees
the asrock said 390 pro war began
throttling after seven minutes when the
surface temperature reached 90 degrees
and the MSI's ed 390 a pro throttled
after eight minutes hitting just 67
degrees for the surface temperature I
left the boards all running for the
hour-long test but because we were verum
throttling these boards didn't get that
much hotter though they did continue to
run at dangerously hot temper
now the gigabyte Zed 390 UD using either
the optimized voltage settings or the
auto voltage configuration did manage to
avoid erm throttling that said it
probably should have throttled as the
1.38 volt configuration got insanely hot
with a MOSFET surface temperature of
just over 100 degrees even with the
optimized voltage we're still seeing a
surface temperature of eighty degrees
which is around a hundred degrees for
the internal temperature
so really all boards technically failed
here as the surface temperatures were
just getting too high
that said the gigabyte Zed 390 UD is
right on the edge and since it didn't
throttle and it maintained this surface
temperature after the hour long stress
test whereas the MSI asrock and a sous
boards would have all gone up in smoke
I'll give gigabyte a pass on this one
ten minutes after running the hour-long
load test these are the temperatures we
were faced with gigabyte didn't cool
down that well though the results are
still decent the big heat sink on the
MSI Z 390 a pro saw a cool down the most
rapidly on the open air test bench while
the asrock and a sous boards also did
quite well despite the fact that it was
really only the gigabyte board that
didn't fail this test miserably normally
I also provide a series of overclocking
results but given the stock performance
I wasn't expecting much from these
entry-level boards with the 99er ok at 5
gigahertz
as expected the sous asrock and msi
boards all failed this test they are the
suffered verum throttling issues almost
right away or they crashed completely
giving us the blue screen of death
the asrock and the swords couldn't
maintain the 1.3 volt 5 gigahertz
overclock and would crash while the msi
board quickly overheated the gigabyte
Zed 390 UD did technically pass this
test without any verum throttling at all
but again with MOSFET surface
temperatures of around 80 degrees
it's a questionable pass for comparison
I have included some higher-end Zed 390
boards that I've already tested and as
you can see there is quite an extreme
difference in the vrm quality and idle
the gigabyte board did cool down nicely
and here it is comparable to the Maximus
11 hero then just to see if I could get
the gigabyte z3 9 AUD to verum throttle
I tested it on the open air test bed and
let it cook surf
temperatures hit 101 degrees and highway
info was reporting a very intemperate of
126 degrees and yet the board never
throttled within 9900 K obviously that's
a fail and even the Maximus 11 hero is
borderline too hot in this test as the
internal MOSFET temperatures and
knocking on the door of 100 degrees
impressively even with no airflow the
Gigabyte said three Niner UD did cool
down to a reasonable temperature after
10 minutes of course it failed the load
test but it's good to see when placed
under extreme load that it's still able
to cool down quite quickly well I think
I think it's fair to say that the entry
level is at 390 motherboards or a bit of
a scam I know that's a harsh way of
putting it but I can't for the life of
me understand what the point of these
motherboards is the gigabyte ones
reasonable but the rest of them yeah I
don't get what the point is in my mind
the entire point of the Zed 390 was to
signify or show that motherboards
donning this particular chipset were
locked and loaded ready for the 1900
if we look at previous Zed 370 models we
see that the bulk of them the lower end
models from MSI gigabyte of Zeus asrock
they all featured for phase V RMS and
most of them will really struggle have
actually done some testing and found
they really struggle with the fully
unleashed 9900 K which is the out of the
box and not the 95 watt TDP limited
power limited setup that we have
actually tested on the channel anyway
and we could take gigabytes range for
example of the 370 boards the Auris
gaming seven that's probably the only
board that should be ok for long-term
use rendering and whatnot with the 900k
everything else is really going to
struggle and yes certainly wouldn't be
an ideal solution for the new 8 core
processor so we already have low-end
affordable 370 motherboards we don't
need low-end affordable Zed 390
motherboards that's not the bloody point
of the Zed 390 chipset now I didn't mean
to have this motherboard there I
actually did I got this board by mistake
I was taking a look at this
born as well but I can make the
comparison that I was going to make
anyway so here is the actual MSI board
that I've been meaning to talk about or
video but I've been pointing at these
air 370 board but this Zed 390 model has
the exact same erm so this is the board
we tested in the video here's the older
version we've got the same for phase V
RM this one has a few extra chokes and a
bigger heatsink and for that you pay $10
more possibly worth paying $10 more I
don't know not really the point because
neither of these boards are really
capable of taking full advantage of the
ninety nine hundred K and well yeah I
suppose those buying a night star okay
now looking at buying of these boards
but as I said earlier video make it a
year down the track you've bought this
board to use a core i3 or a Core i5 and
now you want to upgrade and you 10th
generation Intel stuff probably won't be
compatible with this platform so your
only option would be to get a 19-hour
okay and unfortunately doing that it's
going to put the board under a lot of
stress and not get the most out of the
1900
those boards don't need to exist because
you can spend well a Susa so hide it you
can spend about I think it's only about
$40 more 40 to $50 more and you get a
board that's super capable from the
gigabyte range got doublers and all that
good cooling works really well really
high-quality ISL chips in fact it is
only gigabyte who took this opportunity
to update their Zed 370 arranged with a
fresh new lineup of 390 boards now you
could argue that well they were in most
need of an upgrade their Zed 370 boards
weren't particularly good but it is
great to see them correcting that
previous mistake with a stellar range of
390 motherboards that said even
gigabytes entry-level board and while
their entire entry level line up
everything priced below 170 dollars us
is kind of a make-do situation with the
9900 K so the vrm seen on this board is
then copy and paste it on to their more
expensive $140 and gaming X and M gaming
models as well as the 150 dollar gaming
SLI so it's not until you pony up 100
and $70 us for the Auris elite that
you're really getting a high quality vrm
that's more than capable of tackling the
99 rek so i think it's time to face
facts tim has a lego addiction and entry
levels head 390 motherboards just
shouldn't exist and on that note I am
