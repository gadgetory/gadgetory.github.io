unboxed check out this little beauty I
have with me today
this is gigabytes new geforce gtx 1050
g1 gaming version and that makes it the
biggest baddest 1052 year back model the
company has on offer so I'm very very
keen to check it out
their standard factory overclocked card
runs at a base clock of thirteen hundred
and seventy-nine megahertz the wind
force OSI model claims to 1392 megahertz
and this fancy g1 gaming model hums
along at fourteen hundred and seventeen
megahertz though truth be told it will
run much fast and that thanks to GPU
boost three gigabyte suggests a typical
boost frequency of fifteen hundred and
thirty one megahertz but if you install
the extreme engine software the boost
clock can be up to fifteen hundred and
fifty-six megahertz
at the click of a button getting past
all those megahertz what else does the
g1 gaming card have to offer
well for what is very much a budget GPU
it seems gigabyte aren't messing around
the gtx 1050 chip is cooled by
surprisingly large wind force cooler
featuring a pair of 90 millimeter fans
the cooler also features a pair of
copper heat pipes and three arrays of
aluminium fins this all means it tips
the scales 315 grams which is very heavy
for an entry-level card the standard
marketing lingo is all present here we
have the unique blade fan design 3d
active fans and ultra durable VGA
components still this is a little good
stuff the gigabyte fans run quiet and
the semi passive mode is a nice touch
though they can be found on most
graphics cards these days the ultra
durable components are legit though I
can't honestly say how much difference
it makes
especially for a lower end GPU that
isn't heavy on power still those looking
to overclock should get the most out of
this card thanks to its 4+1 power phases
apparently in videos reference design
which doesn't actually officially exist
at least in the retail channel calls for
a three plus one design the naked PCB
weighs a hundred and ninety three grams
while the full length backplate that
we're about to look at adds another
ninety four grams the backplate looks
pretty swanky though I have to admit I'm
not totally convinced by gigabytes black
and orange
a scheme I think probably a more safe
bet would have been an all-black design
or black and silver black and white
might have been more the shot I don't
know I just think that the black and
orange won't appeal to everyone as much
as a more safe color choice would if you
will
anyway the quality the backplate is
excellent and once removed we see the
Gigabyte is even added a thick thermal
pad to help remove built-up heat from
the backside of the vrm I hope you're
taking notes EVGA I should know that the
main heatsink cools the GPU and gddr5
memory chips but not the VRMs instead
gigabyte is installed a separate little
heatsink here which seems to add a job
well enough and it collects air from the
90 millimeter fans oh and something else
very much worth noting is that this card
features or rather more crucially
requires a 6 pin external PCIe power
cable this is an important point given
that the highlight to the 1050 series is
the fact that it can run entirely from
the power delivered by the PCIe slot by
adding a 6 pin connector that requires a
power input gigabyte is reducing the
cards compatibility with older systems
they of course have models that don't
require this connector but what I want
to know is how much difference does it
make having the ability to potentially
feed the GPU an additional 75 Watts that
question should be answered by the time
we hit the overclocking section of the
review with that we should probably get
on with the testing since this is a
budget GPU priced well below 200 us we
will be using our core i3 6100 T test
machine for this review this processor
doesn't have a problem getting the most
out of the gtx 1050 and while we
recommend viewers using desktop gaming
rigs use these standard 6100 processor
and not the low-voltage model that we
have this lower clocked version does do
a good job of representing the kind of
performance those running older core i3
and even AMD APU rigs can expect anyway
let's blast through the benchmarks the
g1 gaming is an even factory overclocked
one percent higher than the MSI OSI
model yet we see it was three percent
faster given how GPU boost 3 works I
suspect this is down the fact the gear
back card is being fed more power and
more crucially probably runs cooler
which is something we'll look into
shortly this time we find a 4% boost for
the g1 gaming over MSI's OSI model and
that was enough to match the GTX 960 for
gigabyte card in overwatch here is a
look at how the gtx 1050 g1 plays
overwatch please note this footage was
recorded on a core i7 test system using
shadowplay too smart for your own good
Gears of War for around four percent
faster on the g1 gaming with an average
of 56 fps opposed to ms is 54 fps it
appears as though the gigabyte card is
holding slightly higher boost clock
speeds testing with doom showed the g1
gaming model to be 3 FPS faster we're
looking at the minimum and average frame
rates virtually no performance gains
were seen in battlefield one that said
it was great to see player performance
at 1080p using the ultra quality
settings speaking of which here's a
quick look at the battlefield 1
benchmark pass using the Giga Byte 1050
g1 gaming graphics card on the core i7
test rig note this is just a quick
snippet of the past and not the entire
thing which lasts 60 seconds
while that extra power connected didn't
result in added power consumption at
least nothing worth noting the g1 gaming
model sucked down 5 watts more which
still makes it very efficient as for the
operating temperatures well the g1
gaming is impressive via it never
exceeded sixty degrees in our tests very
cool stuff hey unfortunately we were
only able to extract another 5%
performance out of the g1 gaming
graphics card through overclocking this
took us from 56 FPS in Gears of War 4 to
59 fps I probably should point out that
that's just one FPS more than what the
MSI card achieved without an external
power connector the end result was a
100% stable base frequency of fifteen
hundred and seventy five megahertz with
a boost clock of 1689 megahertz
however when gaming the core clock
frequency was pretty well stuck at
eighteen hundred and sixty megahertz
the gddr5 memory was also boosted from
seven gigabits per second to eight
gigabits per second
the 10:50 g1 gaming certainly is a
punchy little graphics card though
unfortunately isn't without a few flaws
but before we get to that let's talk
about some of the good stuff
the cooler is awesome normally you only
see coolers of this caliber on
higher-end cards such as your GTX 1060 s
and things that are more expensive than
that even when overclocked this g1
gaming cooler runs extremely quiet even
under maximum load for extended periods
of time and the out-of-the-box
performance is good not mind-blowing but
you know good for 1050 the addition of a
6 pin PCI II power connector is
questionable it doesn't really help at
all with overclocking while it hurts
compatibility for no real game that's
disappointing and based on what I found
here no 1050 card should really feature
an external power connector this isn't a
deal breaker by any means
after all the vast majority of computers
destined for a little gaming action have
at least one 6 pin PCI a power connector
the real roadblock here is the price as
I noted a few weeks ago in my unboxing
boxes series the price ain't great I
don't really want to rate gigabyte over
the coals on this one though graphics
card pricing tends to change like the
wind
next week the card could be ten or even
twenty dollars cheaper that said right
now the g1 gaming model is priced thirty
u.s. above the MSRP and while that's ti
territory meanwhile their base model
factory overclocked or OSI model is
priced 120 u.s. and twenty dollars
cheaper than the g1 gaming this is the
model I would get yes the cooler has
been downgraded but it's still much more
substantial than what you'll find on the
msi car we reviewed at launch and it
drops the six pin connector anyway I
really like the 1050 g1 gaming I just
don't like the current asking price that
said the good news of my fellow Aussies
is that the g1 gaming is more
competitively priced down under whereas
us-based shoppers are paying almost 30%
more over base models we're getting
stung half as much at 205 Ozzy as the
1050 pricing starts at around 180 Ozzy I
should also note that the $180 model is
it
dinky looking Galax card with a much
smaller single fan cooler and a
rudimentary 2+1 power phase design
so here Australia at least it seems that
the 1050 g1 gaming is actually the card
to get but as always pricing does vary
quite dramatically from region to region
anyway what do you guys think about
gigabytes g1 gaming graphics card do you
think they should have perhaps not
bothered with the six pin connector like
I do let me know in the comments below
and wise keen to hear from you guys and
keep your lids peeled because there will
be a review coming up of the TI model so
the 1050 TI g1 gaming graphics card and
we'll see if that delivers any more with
that six pin connector anyway that's all
from me on this one I'll catch you guys
