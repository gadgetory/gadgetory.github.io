unbox today we've got you a review of
the sous gr8 to which I can only assume
is pronounced the great - this is a
small form-factor gaming PC so I know
that it won't interest to many of you
guys because it is pre-built but there
still seems to be a niche market for
these sort of devices which is why
companies like a soos and MSI produce
them and be great - is just one example
this bad boy here does cost one thousand
US dollars before that price you get
either an Intel Core i5 or Core i7 KB
like CPU there's also an nvidia geforce
gtx 1063 gigabyte GPU which is the same
across all models of the great - there's
also either 8 or 16 gigabytes of RAM and
MDOT - SSD and 2.5 inch hard drive
storage options in my review that I
received a core i7 7700 CPUs that's the
non K model as well as 16 gigabytes of
RAM a 256 m dot 2 SSD and of course the
GTX 1063 gigabyte GPU so it's a
reasonably powerful system for something
so compact but there are definitely some
concerns of mine relating to some
aspects of this device most notably the
thing that I don't particularly like
about the gi8
- is its design I just can't get behind
this really odd gamer style design that
as Susan's been using across most of
their republic of gamers products there
are some really strange angles around
the body of the great - and some very
odd patterns as well that don't make it
nearly as great as the name would
suggest first in my opinion it's a
pretty ugly case that they've used here
definitely not as attractive some have
been more understated and more classy
looking designs that you find on modern
consoles like the Xbox one and
PlayStation 4 pro and even competing
small form-factor pieces like the msi
trident 3 of course it wouldn't be a
gamer orange and product without some
RGB LED lighting and you will find it on
the front
of the GRA to hear through those we're
lines and patterns or whatever a soos is
decided to do here I don't think it
looks too great in fact I think almost
the RGB lighting detracts from the
overall design and it can often clash
with that actually quite nice copper
strip that sort of goes through the
center that adds a bit of highlight to
the design but I think those RGB lights
if you don't set it to sort of an
appropriate color can clash a little bit
there most of this chassis is made of
plastic and doesn't look quite as nice
of some of the more premium small
form-factor designs or consoles that
we've seen kind of it's a little bit
cheaper in some regards but at least
soos has been keeping the cost down with
their choice of materials here one of
the advantages to this design is that it
is quite compact at just 7 litres it's
only slightly larger than the 5 litre
Playstation 4 pro and it's around the
same size as the original Xbox one so
any place that you could put those game
consoles you will still be able to fit
the gr8 2 although that said it is
mostly designed to stand in a vertical
orientation both as other consoles can
go horizontal quite comfortably but with
the gr8 2 it can look a little strange
on the side thanks to that weird angular
body so it's creative suits has only
sort of made this device to sit in one
orientation as far as I always concerned
you get two USB 3.0 ports on the front
as well as two 3.5 ml or no Jack's on
the back you'll find another 3.5 mm
audio jack and s/pdif optical audio
output
there's USB 3.1 type-a port a USB 3.1
type C port to further USB 3.0 type a
ports as Ethernet as well and a
proprietary power dongle because it does
require an external power brick all the
display connectivity is connected
directly to the graphics card you get
one DisplayPort and two HDMI ports so
running triple screen setups is no
problem on the GRA to diving inside the
great - now and it's disappointing to
discover that neither the CPU nor the
GPU are user
upgradeable so whatever you purchase
from a seuss you're going to be stuck
with for the lifetime of the great - and
when we're talking about just a GTX 1063
gigabyte GPU there's definitely some
room for upgrade ability there but you
simply can't do it with this small
form-factor PC and
even accessing the side of the
motherboard where you'll find the CPU
and GPU requires significant disassembly
so it's pretty clear that even if they
were user upgradeable that MSI
definitely doesn't want you to touch
them there are some user upgradeable
aspects to the great - you'll find an
end to sd-6
there's also a single dim slot
accessible of the two DIMM slots in this
device so upgrading the RAM as well
tends to be pretty straightforward and
for those that purchase one of the great
tools that does come with a 2.5 inch
drive bay inside again it's swapping
that out is pretty straightforward but
for at least for me my model only came
with an M naught 2 SSD and there was no
2.5 inch mounting Bay actually installed
in this device so it's a bit
disappointing for those that purchased
the device it only comes with Android 2
SSDs that you can't add in a 2.5 inch
drive after the fact
while Seuss's thermal design seems to be
reasonably clever on paper in that in
takes air through the bottom and rear of
the chassis and exhaustion at the top in
practice it isn't as good as I would
like to see this device runs pretty loud
under load and if you don't have a pair
of headphones to use while gaming or
some loud external speakers and you
place the grh to reasonably close to
your monitor you will definitely be able
to hear it over ingame audio and the GPU
fan in particular is pretty loud and
could definitely to put some quieting
down in terms of actual temperatures
inside this device while running
something like item 64 stability test
the CPU can achieve over ninety degree
Celsius temperatures which is pretty hot
but at least the GPU tends to be
reasonably cool sitting more in the 70
degrees Celsius range and when you are
playing games and not running your
stress test the CPU temperatures are a
bit more manageable in the 80 degree
range as all models of CPU available for
the great two are non K models meaning
there cannot be overclocked I'm not too
concerned about the lack of thermal
Headroom available from this CPU cooler
as for the GPU there's definitely enough
thermal Headroom for overclocking as
this is just a standard GTX 1063
gigabyte you can download pretty much
any utility you like for overclocking
and get to it straight away I was able
to achieve around 9 to 13 percent more
performance out of the GTX 260 in mind
gr8 2
which falls in line with what we see
from desktop gtx 1060 graphics card so
it's a pretty good result from this mini
PC and it's definitely something you
should experiment with because it only
raised temperatures of the GPU by around
3 degrees Celsius under load which is
certainly manageable although it did
make the unit a little bit louder which
I guess isn't ideal but it's a pretty
loud unit overall I'm not going to dive
too deep into performance because this
is a desktop PC and I found that the
performance from the GTX 1063 gigabyte
inside the grade 2 is almost identical
to what we've seen from this graphics
card in some of our previous coverage of
it so it's definitely worth checking out
all of our previous coverage of games
graphics cards and the like to find out
how the GTX 1063 gigabyte performs and
you can pretty much just take those
results and apply to the GRA - it's very
similar in that regard what's
interesting to note is that some models
of this mini PC come with the core i5
7400 CPU inside and I tend to recommend
this over the i7 7700 because it's a
cheaper device to get just the Core i5
CPU and the performance difference in
games is pretty negligible when we're
talking about a GTX 1060 3 gigabytes
that is almost certainly GPU
bottlenecked in most gaming situations
so it's worth definitely saving just a
little bit of money in opting just with
the Core i5 CPU inside what I will touch
on briefly is that this console is well
suited to gaming at 1080p and around
60fps on sort of the high to very high
presets in most modern titles in Deus Ex
mankind divider for example you can run
it at the ultra preset but you'll be
looking at more 30fps which I know isn't
really acceptable for most of your PC
gamers out there but if you reduce the
quality seeing two sort of high or very
high you'll be looking at more like 50
to 60 fps and it's a similar story in
watchdogs 2 again running it sort of the
high to very high preset at 1080p 2 is a
very good quality experience in games
and certainly better than you'll see on
either the Xbox one or Playstation 4
which often run at resolutions below
1080p and frame rate swapped at 3 so on
the GRA - it's definitely a pretty
decent showing from the cable xcp us and
the GTX 1063 gigabyte inside in terms of
pricing the assist GRA - tends to run
from around the 900 to 1100 US dollar
range which is pretty decent for the
hardware you get inside and that most of
the price points
this mini pcs available you actually get
slightly better hardware than you'll
find in the msi trident 3 which is a
competing mini pc also with the gtx 1063
gigabyte inside as i mentioned earlier i
don't think there's much point buying
the core i7 cpu because in most
situations you will be GPU bottleneck
using the gtx 960 3 gigabyte so it makes
more sense to get something like the
core i5 7400 because it's cheaper and
will give you roughly the same
performance of course you can also
upgrade the SSD the 2.5 inch drive and
the ram so if you do get something on
the lower end of the scale you can
simply upgrade with your own hardware
later but I think that the price point
of the $1000 model is pretty reasonable
for what you get in this device I do
have some issues with the great 2 which
mostly revolve around its design which i
think is pretty unattractive it's
cooling solution is quite loud under
load and neither its CPU or GPU I use
are upgradable I guess if you're not a
fan of the design and you think it's too
loud you can simply hide away this
console during use and the hardware that
you get inside is very competitive and
quite good for the price that you're
paying a little bit better than the msi
try them free across the board I guess
that's the most important part of you
know the buying decision for a desktop
small form-factor PC in that respect
these suits gr8 2 is a decent buy at
most of its price points anyway that's
it for this review of the sushi r8 2
there is a written review on tech spot
comm if you are interested in that don't
forget we have our patreon it's set up
now you can find links to that in the
