today's video it's a pretty simple one
I'll be going through every graphics
quality setting in Metro Exodus to show
you how they compare in terms of both
visuals and performance we've already
explored how rate racing looks in this
game in a separate video so the focus
here is on the other graphical effects
if you're interested in rate racing go
back and check that video Steve has also
already covered how Metro Exodus
performs across a wide variety of GPUs
so we know it's a pretty demanding game
though it does deliver fantastic visuals
that make it easy to see why you need a
powerful GPU for ultra settings at 1080p
for example you will need something like
a gtx 1070 for 60 FPS gaming with cards
we usually see doing well at this
resolution like the rx 580 only
delivering a 40 FPS experience hopefully
we can improve the performance for
owners of mid-range GPS without too much
impact of visuals with our
recommendations in this video and for
those interested at 1440p you'll need
something like a GTX 1080 while at 4k
the only option is the r-tx 2080 ti
coincidentally all of the footage you
see in this video was captured at 4k
using the r-tx 20 TI with our core i
$9.99 hundred kg rig used for testing as
always our performance numbers here are
an average of results across several
GPUs from both Nvidia and AMD both
mid-range and high-end and the footage
you see captured with the 2080 ti
doesn't always align with where we
benchmark that's because we use a single
benchmark run for all the performance
data which encompasses many of the
visual effects used in the game while
the visual comparisons focus in on the
differences in quality this allows us to
show you how each setting looks without
resorting to single scene FPS spot
checks that may not be reflective of a
settings typical impact in the game by
using the single benchmark pilots who
get a general idea of how setting can
impact typical gameplay rather than only
in specific scenes and you're watching
the benchmark pass here so I've used an
in-game run rather than the benchmark
tool which is more intensive in the
sections of the game I've played so fast
that's why we decided to go in game here
the one difference I've made here
compared to our other optimization
guides is to split out the performance
impact for AMD and NVIDIA GPUs for some
said
Metro Exodus includes Nvidia's hair
works and physics implementations with a
heavy tessellation option which have
noticeably different performance impacts
depending on which brand of GPU you have
but we'll get to that later
Metro Exodus actually doesn't have that
many tweakable settings my previous
metro games a lot of the options you'd
normally see are all bundled into the
generic quality setting this acts as a
sort of a preset but without the option
for any further customization to things
like shadow quality textures or lighting
but it's not a full preset either
because several other settings like
motion blur tessellation and texture
filtering are left to their own options
this makes the quality option the key
thing to look at here to be honest it is
a bit frustrating we can't tweak
elements individually because I feel
that would have given the best scope
optimization but it is what it is
instead I'll just have to show a bunch
of scenes so that you can see how each
of them compare one of the key
differences between the five available
modes is the lighting quality in fact
the differences are similar to what
ray-traced global illumination provides
in this game the ultra and extreme modes
have the darkest presentation with the
highest quality shadowing and best
ambient occlusion the atmosphere when
using either of these quality modes is
in my opinion better than the brighter
and less shadowed high mode and it
really adds to the game overall the
ultra and extreme modes have I guess a
more accurate reflection of how the
lighting should be interacting with the
environment while this change in
lighting is most noticeable in lit
indoor sense it's also visible outdoors
though to a lesser extent for some
people whether to use the high or ultra
modes will come down to a personal
preference if you prefer brightest
shadows unless ambient occlusion hi is
the way to go if you want a darker more
atmospheric experience you'll need to
use at least the ultra preset as I
mentioned my r-tx video I feel the
duiker presentation is more accurate and
looks better so my choice would be ultra
though I understand why some people may
not like this and go with high instead
medium and low are also options of
course though they bring an even
brighter presentation again it seems
that with medium ambient occlusion is
largely disabled which flattens out the
image there are differences between all
five modes in terms of shadow quality
extreme has the sharpest shadows it's
one of the very few differences I
spotted between the extreme and ultra
modes and even then it's pretty subtle
as
you step down through ultra to medium
shadows become less sharp when you
switch to the low mode dynamic shadow
rendering is disabled entirely and you
just get fixed baked in shadows which
looks a bit crap so ideally you'd want
to use at least medium for this setting
between the Ultron higher modes a lot of
differences in geometry level and draw
distance which also roll away further
when switching down to medium or low
it's a subtle change but if you want the
best draw distances again Ultra is what
you'll need to choose screen space
reflections use for water surfaces but
only on the high modes and above with
medium and low water looks flat and
boring without any reflections in terms
of texture quality ideas about any
significant difference between the upper
4 modes at 4k it's only when switching
to low that the texture quality drops
away noticeably giving the game a blurry
look I also swallowed some minor
improvements to skin rendering and
higher quality setting levels I'm sure
there's a few more things are missing
but those seem to be the key differences
in the quality setting we're looking at
the performance difference it's no
surprise to see such a large jump in
performance between each of the modes
because many of the graphical elements
are changing with h1 going from ultra to
extreme sees a 16% average performance
reduction which considering the very
minor visual difference really isn't
worth it going from Ultra to high sees
things swing the other way a 17%
performance improvement I feel these are
the two key options because there are
visual differences between the two and I
feel a 17% difference is pretty
reasonable considering the changes as I
said earlier the ultra mode has darker
better shadowed lighting that looks more
realistic while the high mode is
brighter which some people may prefer I
think that which presentation you
personally prefer should dictate this
choice if you want the dark atmospheric
look with improvements to several other
errors then ultras for you but if you
prefer a brighter look then hive will
improve your performance medium with
it's disabled screen space reflections
lower resolution shadows and
significantly toned down a beam
occlusion is something I'd reserved
purely for mid-range cards despite the
near 50% performance uplift over ultra
the difference between medium and ultra
is significant so I feel gamers with
more powerful systems we appreciate the
better visuals of ultra or even the high
mode despite the fact you will get lower
performance however I still feel this
single quality setting reel should be
split into several options to allow
further tweaking for example those who
prefer the bright
to look at the high mode aren't able to
get the sharpest shadows and better draw
distances of the ultra mode the more we
can tweak the more you can optimize the
visual quality and performance a metro
really doesn't allow much in this regard
there are a small collection of settings
not bundled into the quality mode motion
blur is the first one and again a bit of
a personal preference thing here having
to do all three modes the high setting
applies a pretty heavy and noticeable
motion blur it's not something I liked a
whole lot I reckon the high mode was
designed with consoles in mind which
tend to make heavy use of blur for 30
FPS gaming one of the many benefits of
having a PC not having to game at 30 FPS
anyway normal sees a much more subtle
use of motion blur while low largely
disables the effect looking at the
performance differences turning the
setting down from the console like high
mode to either normal or low so our one
percent performance improvement so not a
big change
this makes the choice of settings a
personal preference thing I suspect most
people want normal or low here DL SS I
covered briefly in my RT X video this is
a feature exclusive to Nvidia stirring
r-tx GPUs in my opinion it doesn't work
very well at all it blurs the image
noticeably as if the game was using a
really bad anti-aliasing technique
switching it on gave a 23% performance
improvement at 4k using a twenty atti
without ray-tracing though this
improvement can vary a lot depending on
the GPU resolution and settings you're
using I wouldn't consider using DL SS if
you need more performance and don't mind
a slight reduction to sharpness stick to
the much better scaling factor setting
in the game how it works is where you
can start to see some pre significant
performance improvements however there's
also a sizeable difference in visuals
monsters with the fur covering look much
better with hair works enables not only
is the hair completely different color
it also covers more of the body it
ripples in the air and it can be colored
by blood and grime monsters without hair
works have static boring pretty crappy
looking hair similar to all of other
games while the visual difference is
massive and makes hair works on look
much better than hair works off I can't
help but wonder if the hair works off
version of the creatures was downgraded
deliberately to make hair works look
especially good not even having the same
hair color or positioning with hair
works disabled is a bit suspicious to me
the developers really should have been
able to get both modes looking a lot
closer the performance is also quite
drastic
you might expect only a small section of
our benchmark run included hair work
scriptures so the 1% lows are key the
work out here disabling hair works saw a
13% improvement to 1% lows within video
cards but a huge 28% improvement for AMD
cards which once again show us how game
works punishes AMD hardware although
really in this case it's punishing both
GPU brands because even a 13% hit is
quite high if for a games were serious
about delivering high quality hair
effects in this game they would have
used tress-fx instead of hair works
because every trace effects
implementation I've seen is
significantly less demanding than hair
works on both AMD and NVIDIA cards it
also doesn't favor either brand so let's
hope for our games put that game works
cash from Nvidia to good use the good
news is there doesn't appear to be any
performance difference between physics
on and off whether you have an NVIDIA
GPU or AMD GPU even in the benchmark
tool there is no difference and I
couldn't spot any visual changes either
so yeah really not sure what this
setting does moving on we have
tessellation one of the most intensive
effects in the game across outdoor
environments in particular there's a
reasonable change in depth between the
on and off modes for tessellation so a
massive change but turning tessellation
off does lead to flatter surfaces
however the tessellation is also still
active in indoor scenes where I couldn't
really spot any visual changes aside
from a reduced framerate the big issue
with tessellation in metro Exodus is the
performance in from video cards you'll
key at a 17 percent heat through our
benchmark run but with AMD cards that
jumps up to a 27 percent hit on average
and nearly 50% for 1% lows 50 percent
that's pretty crazy clearly something
about test fashion in this game is over
utilizing the effect which is putting
unnecessary strain on AMD Hardware AMD
cards can handle a bit of white
tessellation it's a feature used in a
lot of titles but when you start to ramp
it up to crazy levels it can seriously
stress out an AMD GPU relative to an
NVIDIA GPU considering even NVIDIA GPUs
hit to the tune of nearly 20% as only
game is significantly over using
tessellation given the visual
differences I spotted with such a huge
performance hit my recommendation is to
disable tessellation on both Nvidia and
especially AMD GPUs I'd like to think
this effect is broken in its current
state given the massive
performance impact it has but again as
this is a game works title I wouldn't
rule out a bit of foul play here that's
ended up hurting everyone also note that
the impact of tessellation in the actual
game is much higher than the benchmark
tool shows the final setting in the game
is texture filtering in the scenes I
tested I found it pretty hard to spot a
difference between the two offered modes
f-16 X and a of 4x there's no difference
between either mode in terms of
performance so I suspect for air games
included this option purely for ultra
low energy use which can struggle with
higher anisotropic filtering modes it's
also worth mentioning there is a shading
rate option in the game this is like a
render scale option for super sampling
or subsampling except it only modifies
the shading rate rather than the overall
resolution most people should leave this
setting on the default 1.0 x option so
if metro exorcists there really isn't a
lot of settings you can twink basically
everything is bundled into the quality
setting and then most of the other
settings are things related to game
works and RT x so overall it's a very
simple affair my recommendation for most
people is to still use the ultra quality
setting extreme comes with a sizable
performance hit despite only small
changes to visuals those who prefer a
brighter game should up to the high mode
but there is a noticeable difference
overall between high and ultra that sees
me favor ultra in most instances while
mid-range gamers can gain a lot of
performance with the medium mode at a
reasonably big loss to visual quality
for the other settings I recommend
motion blur on either normal or low
depending on your preference and leave
all of invidious features disabled so
that's a DL SS off ray tracing off hair
works off and tessellation off with
physics really doing nothing so settings
up to you
DL SS blows the image so it isn't worth
using I don't mind ray tracing in this
game but the performance cost of 30 to
40 percent is still too high while hey
works and tessellation are also far too
intensive for the visual improvement you
get and then I'd recommend texture
filtering at the maximum AF 16x and the
default rating read option of 1 x with
those settings in play NVIDIA GPU owners
will see a rounded 20% performance
improvement compared to having every
setting except in videos RT X features
enabled so ultra selling gamers will see
a 20% improvement
high selling gamers 20% as well are the
two modes have a 17 percent gap between
them and again the choice between ultra
and high is
actually down to which visual star you
prefer that's why I'm recommending
either option with the personal
preference for ultra AMD GPU owners will
see larger gains up around 30% on
average and even higher for 1% lows this
twenty to thirty percent improvement
does come with some reductions to visual
quality from canning tessellation and
hair works however the best part is all
the other excellent visual features are
retained why do think both features and
even rate racing have their benefits the
game still looks spectacular with those
things disabled while running a lot
better and more consistently however I
do wish that for a games had opened up
the quarry options a bit more rather
than bundling everything together into
really basic presets I feel we probably
could have achieved more than a twenty
to thirty percent performance uplift for
similar visual quality if we had access
to other options I also suspect a lot of
people were already playing with hair
works disabled so the performance gains
drop even further when you take that out
of calculations finally I really wish
this wasn't a game works title because I
feel both hair simulations and
tessellation could have been integrated
at much lower performance costs than
what this game currently offers which
would benefit both Nvidia and AMD GPU
owners that's it for this one so far I'm
having a blast playing Metro Exodus so I
can't wait to stop benchmarking and
actually just get into playing the game
through it seems like a lot of fun if
you missed either our rate racing or
general benchmark coverage that's
already up on the channel and of course
