unbox today steve has tasked me with
looking at a product he's wanted for
quite some time a professional-grade 32
inch 4k monitor he can use for video
editing and perhaps a bit of gaming and
benchmarking on the side the monitor in
question is the viewsonic VP 3268
one of the highest and monitors
viewsonic cells and a huge shout-out
here to viewsonic for not only providing
us with the monitor to review but also
allowing us to use it for our content
creation to make things clearer this
monitor isn't geared towards gaming
that's not to say you can't use it for
gaming but you'd probably be better
served with a similar display for half
the price the lack of a gaming focus is
seen in the spec sheet - as this panel
does not support variable refresh
technology like free sync and it's 14
millisecond grader gray response time is
fairly slow certainly slower than I'd
want for gaming what you do get though
is an excellent set of professional
features each VP 3268 is individually
calibrated at the factory with delta ii
levels below 2.0 - for commonly used
color spaces srgb rec 709 sm p te - c +
eb you each color space gets its own
display mode accessible through the
on-screen display and each comes with a
detailed calibration report in the box
so you can verify whether the display is
up to scratch the VP 3268 also uses a
true 8-bit panel with support for up to
a fourteen bit lookup table and support
for 10 bit through FRC there's no true
10 bit display but then again there's
not any of these panels actually
available below $2,000 so we'll take the
8 bit plus FRC here the panel itself is
an IPS LCD with a 1,300 to 1 contrast
ratio 315 units of peak brightness and
what viewsonic claims is excellent
uniformity another key feature for
professionals the monitor even supports
HDR though this feature isn't advertised
and that's probably for a good reason
more on
later I really like the design of this
display and that's because it gets the
most important thing right
that's the bezel size they're bezels
around the VP 3268 on all sides are
extremely thin which helps make the
expansive 32 inch panel feel even larger
it also helps when you want to use
multiple monitors something creative
professionals almost always do as you
can put two of these displays
side-by-side with a very small gap
between as far as construction is
concerned the monitor is well built but
it doesn't go overboard with fancy
features are unnecessary Flair most of
the monitor uses basic plastic and it's
somewhat annoying the parts of the stand
use a glossy dust attracting finish but
the design does look good though and
won't look out of place on a
professionals desk did I mention the
bezels are really slim because yeah that
is definitely the best part of this
design all the stand adjustability you'd
want is included here such as a 130 ml
of height adjustment 120 degrees of
swivel and you can pivot it into a
portrait orientation there's also a
small though serviceable amount of tilt
and of course you can reason out it if
you desire what about connectivity well
there's no shortage of display inputs to
HDMI 2.0 ports a full-size DisplayPort
and also a mini DisplayPort Mini DP is
an unusual connector to use here though
I guess it must be useful for someone
otherwise you know viewsonic wouldn't
have included it there's also a set of
three point five mil or do jacks one
input and one output allowing you to use
either the dual 5 watt internal speakers
or you can pass through audio from HDMI
or DisplayPort oh and there's also a 4
port USB 3.0 hub as well unless positive
note the on-screen display is hard to
control as it uses basic buttons rather
than a directional toggle if you want to
change color profile can be achieved
relatively easily but if you want to
fine tune any other controls it's a
difficult slog through menus that aren't
really designed for these sort of
controls most of the controls in the OSD
are relatively common inclusions things
such as brightness and contrast sliders
color temperature controls settings for
overdrive and so forth well I didn't
find ghosting to be too much of an issue
with this display while using it you
know for just general applications and
desktop use you know despite that
slow 14 millisecond response time
switching to overdrive to sort of a
medium setting did improve things in
fact through Sonic even suggests you can
have the response times with an
appropriate overdrive setting it's not
surprising that response times less than
ideal because viewsonic has opted for a
professional-grade
IPS LCD rather than the faster turn of
VA panels that we often find at these
sort of 4k displays what you do get with
the IPS panel is excellent viewing
angles in all directions helped through
an anti-glare coating the 3840 by 2160
resolution this pound uses isn't all
that new these days but it's always nice
to see such a sharp and crisp
presentation at this size I am still
waiting on 4k displays with greater than
60 Hertz refresh rates to hit the market
you know those were supposed to be
coming this year but it hasn't really
eventuated though for now the VP 3268
hits the maximum of 60 Hertz we've seen
at this resolution in my testing the
display hit the marks that viewsonic
lists in their specification sheet for
brightness and contrast when cranked all
the way up to maximum this display
achieved just a bit over 350 nits in my
testing while contrast was around
fourteen sixty to one actually higher
than viewsonic States this has
maintained well at lower brightness
levels to falling to around 1400 to one
to 120 news uniformity is outstanding
and that's exactly as you'd expect from
a professional-grade display no
backlight bleed to speak of and a sub
1.5 Delta II color difference relative
to the center most quadrants are
actually a sub 1.0 Delta a difference
and this improves a darker gray scale
levels I haven't yet seen a cheaper or
gaming focus monitor that achieves
similar levels of uniformity so it's
clear that this is one thing you only
get with a more expensive monitor like
this so let's see how the monitor
performs in this section I'll be
focusing exclusively on the srgb mode as
that's the most popular color profile
and the one I'm most familiar with for
testing the other modes particularly
rec.709 will be handy for those who
require more niche color spaces relevant
to their fields of work but srgb is the
most common and the most widely used the
first
thing I want to point out is you must
switch the monitor into its srgb mode
from the default color mode if you want
srgb accuracy the default mode is
basically a user mode that allows you to
change various settings and make
adjustments to performance while the
integrated color modes lock down
settings to adhere to factory
calibration the only disappointing
aspect to the srgb mode is the
brightness is locked to 120 nets which
is fine for most office use but it
doesn't give users the flexibility to
adjust brightness to suit their usage
conditions sure accuracy might stray
from that factory reported different
brightness levels but I'd like to see a
way to unlock this feature within the
mode perhaps with the toggle between
your factory calibrated brightness and a
user brightness aside from this the srgb
mode is outstanding and requires very
few tweaks to achieve elite performance
starting with grayscale results we're
seeing a Delta II average of 1.71
which achieves view Sonic's calibration
targets and provides near-perfect
accuracy gamma is fantastic while color
temperature appears slightly tinted
towards the red end of the spectrum
though on average it does come close to
that ideal 6,500 K mark this correlates
well as well with that report that
viewsonic provided in the box
saturation performance is outstanding
with the Delta II average under 1.0 with
a peak value no greater than 2.0 this
sort of performance is rarely seen in
those cheaper gaming focused displays so
you're certainly getting your money's
worth here color checker results are
also fantastic again with the Delta II
average under 1.0 and very few colors
exceeding a Delta II of 2.0 despite the
significant amount of cards that this
test actually tests for these sort of
results and not only what you'd want but
also what you'd expect from a
professional monitor and it's impressive
that viewsonic has actually outperformed
their own metrics in providing a Delta a
that's not just lower than 2.0 on
average but often under 1.0 for
individual colors the benefit having
this sort of performance out of the box
is you don't need to mess around with
color profiles in Windows which are
often irritating to set up correctly and
many programs simply ignore them with a
viewsonic VP 3268 you can plug in this
model and guarantee accurate performance
in whatever
application you'd like without having to
deal with messy profiles the absolute
best performance I would suggest using a
color calibration tool to tidy up those
grayscale performance
achieving a Delta a under one point sir
with this display is trivial though that
will require software profile if you
don't choose to do this though you will
still get fantastic results I did want
to talk briefly here about the HDR mode
that's included which you can find
buried in the display settings flick it
on and the VP 3268 appears as an HDR
capable display in Windows 10 and in
support and games firstly you're never
going to get an ideal HDR experience
with this monitor as it a doesn't
support a gamut wider than srgb and B
doesn't support a high enough brightness
using HDR on this monitor is like using
HDR on any old STR display it doesn't
work really even make sense in fact for
the most part enabling hgr makes the
display work considerably worse as
Windows and games try and do things the
monitor is not capable of the main
question when buying any
professional-grade hardware is whether
the pro specific features and
certifications justify the increased
price tag in the case of the VP 3268
this display is available for around
nine hundred dollars or thirteen hundred
ozzie while the cheapest 32 inch 4k
monitor is around $450 to 700 Australian
these days obviously if you're a gamer
that just wants a 32 inch 4k display
there's no reason to buy the VP 3268
get something in Cheaper instead and you
probably be happier but if you're a
professional that wants a high quality
accurate display there's a lot to like
about the VP 3268
it supports four separate color spaces
each with a dedicated factory calibrated
profile and in my testing with the srgb
mode it's certainly very accurate you
simply won't find an equivalent display
with this level of accuracy without
using an awkward software profiles that
is around that $450 price point it also
has outstanding uniformity another key
ingredient professionals and something
much harder to calibrate with an
inferior display from that perspective
if you do want these features the VP
3268 is a great Buy
I'm sure Steve will be very high
he added to his testing in content
creation workflow otherwise I'll have to
head to his place and steal it back off
him anyway if you're interested in
grabbing one of these monitors and links
to it are in the description below
through Amazon and I guess I have to get
back to some rise in mobile testing so
I'll catch you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
