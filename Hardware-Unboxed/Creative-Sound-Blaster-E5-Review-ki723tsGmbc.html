boxed
I'm your host Matt and today we've got a
hands-on a very cool little product
creative soundblaster ePHI portable
headphone amp creative has long been a
favorite sound solution for PC gamers
and the Sound Blaster branding has been
synonymous with upgradeable PC audio
since their windows 95 sound card days
in 2015 they boasts a range of audio
solutions under the moniker and one of
the newest product lines is the sound
blaster a line of all-in-one portable
dark amps of which today we have on hand
the Sound Blaster e5 first of all let's
take a look at everything you get inside
the package the box itself is nothing
remarkable from the outside but when you
break open the seal and peel it open it
has a surprisingly premium feel on the
inside everything is held in place by
this layer of foam up top and the device
itself is in case an obscure
velvet-covered plastic there's a box in
the box below which houses the funky red
micro USB cable handy desktop stand and
two branded elastic bands a couple of
instruction manuals and warranty
documents and there's also a mini
Toslink cable included which is
certainly a nice touch the desktop stand
I mentioned is also a nice addition to
the package especially considering the
e5s microphone capabilities not only can
you set it up on top of your desks with
its anti slip rubber base but it also
comes the gold-plated threaded mount on
the bottom so you can secure it to a
microphone stand or similar I really
liked the build and aesthetic design of
the e5 well I'm not constructed of
aluminium it's smooth plastics feel and
look very high quality the underside of
the e5 is covered with a furry rubber
panel branded with the sound blaster
logo and it protects and insulates the
device from whichever surface you have
it laying on the rear features the micro
USB port a full-size USB host port a
line obstacle out port and the Lion Mark
optical input on the left side there are
three small white battery indicator
lights and towards the front left you
can switch between low and high gains
toggle sound blasters SPX audio
enhancement and the last button controls
power and bluetooth connections finally
the front side features a nice
volume wheel with the trademark creative
red base that can be pressed at any time
to meet whatever you're playing which is
pretty handy either side of the volume
wheel at two three and a half filled
headphone out ports that can of course
be used simultaneously the e5 really
thrives in terms of functionality in
typical creative fashion they design the
e5 to be able to do everything under the
Sun and then some creative on the a5
with a cirrus logic cs4 39 eight dark
which is capable of up to 24 192
decoding is compatible with Android by
OTG i gadget via lightening or 30-pin pc
and mac but unfortunately lacks DSD in
this implementation creative have also
packed in a texas instruments TI 6120 a2
headphone amplifier that can power two
sets of headphones by the twin outputs
on the front you also have the option to
bypass the amp in component through the
lineout functions so you can connect it
to your amp of choice and simply use it
as a digital to the analog signal
converter something i really enjoyed
about the e5 was the aptX bluetooth
connectivity which you can quickly pair
two devices using its built-in Near
Field Communication aptX is important
for this product as is aimed at game is
to require very low latency even a
slight delay will basically render it
useless for serious gamers so this is
great to see on top of that it also
offers much better sound quality to boot
you're also able to control compatible
devices hands-free and taking me calls
using bluetooth in the three clever
built-in mics which amplify record and
adjusts which two microphones are in use
based on the e5 s orientation creative
have always been great with their
software integration and PC interfacing
and this is a real strength of the sound
blaster a5 you get access to an
equaliser SPX audio settings audio
profiles crystal voice technology to
customize the mark setup settings to
configure for either speakers or
headphones and you can set up mixing
options for individual channels of
output I had no issues with the software
it was easy to install easy to set up
and reliable the battery life of the
sound blaster 85 is good but certainly
not exceptional the sound the e5
delivers is much what you'd expect from
a portal or amp or DAC if anything the
tonality leans toward bass a little but
the most part I would say it's fairly
neutral the mids and highs sounded nice
to me but admittedly I'm not a full-on
audiophile and a more discernible ear
would probably be able to give you a
more accurate reading what I can say
though is that paired with a five you
beginning a much cleaner sound at high
volumes and certainly plenty more volume
to play with overall Sound Blaster z5 is
a really solid portable dark and amped
solution features wise it's unmatched
this price point and its connectivity
and on the goro options are impressive
too I think the e5 sound profile will
suit gamers especially with a slight
lean towards bass and an overall clean
and detailed sound currently priced at
$199 I believe the Sound Blaster e5 is
going to make a lot of audio discerning
gamers who appreciate portability very
happy thanks for joining me for another
