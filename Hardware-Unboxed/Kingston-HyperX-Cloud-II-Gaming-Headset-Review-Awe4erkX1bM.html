a look at another gaming headset I cross
my fingers and hope is the best one I've
seen I've always heard great things
about the Kingston HyperX cloud twos and
I've been really excited to finally get
my hands on them this is Kingston
flagship headset so I'm expecting big
things now I can't exactly same Kingston
all the credit for anything the cloud 2
is produced due to the fact they are in
fact a rebranded and improved edition of
the cupid qh 90 gaming headset now this
is absolutely not a criticism in fact it
seems smart for the memory specialist
base their audio entry on a device
proven to both of high quality and
exceptional value despite the name of
the channel I rarely spend much time
talking about the unboxing experience
with our products but with the cloud
tools it's actually worth mentioning the
initial out of marketing box is nothing
to write home about when you slip it off
you met with a really nice gunmetal grey
box featuring the HyperX logo sliding
off the top lid you met with a message
from HyperX general manager and is great
fire king williamson welcoming you to
the HyperX team there's a brief
instruction manual thin paper layer and
thin piece of foam concealing the rest
of the contents and upon their removal
you'll find the headset and accessories
themselves in a bed of black foam with a
small HyperX box at the bottom like I
said I don't put too much weight on the
unboxing experience but it's clear from
the get-go with this headset the HyperX
have considered the minor details looks
wise I personally don't think the cloud
2 is going to be winning any design
awards they're pretty basic I got the
gunmetal gray color way which is very
understated and subtle and will sue
people who prefer that sort of look the
headband is wrapped in soft plush
leather it features live stitching on
both sides the HyperX logo is featured
across the top and large solid plastic
caps join the headband to the extendable
brushed aluminium ear cuff arms these
join to the ear cuffs themselves on both
sides along with a braided audio cable
on both ear cups the ear cups do till up
and down but they don't actually rotate
at all the headset itself does twist a
little however I didn't find this to
cause any comfort issues
perhaps a rather standard rounded shape
and the medium to large earpieces are
matching oval shape to capping off the
aesthetics is a silver HyperX logo
emblazoned on both sides now comfort is
real strength of the cloud to headset
the overall weight including the
microphone in cable is 350 grams which
is around 25% lighter than some of the
other headsets we've looked at lately
more importantly they don't feel at all
heavy on the head
they don't grip too tightly either the
default leather wrapped ear car padding
is really soft as it expect and the long
even padding on the headband is - you
probably noticed that I mentioned the
ear cups are replaceable
this is because Kingston have included
an alternative plush foam set of ear
cups most I don't like the feel to
leather also generously included is a
HyperX branded mesh carry bag and even
an airplane adapter so you can use them
on flights these are all great
inclusions by Kingston testament to the
fact that they took the time to consider
the finer details I'm a big fan of
detachable microphones and the cloud
tubes have got one this is great for
when you want to walk down the street
with them without revealing you're a
gamer and also provides the option to
reduce the weight of the headset
slightly when you're not recording
Kingston claim the mark is digitally
enhanced and I used to record this
entire section not too shabby
the boom is long and can be molded
easily to any sort of shape which is
nice too
I like the cable setup to the headset
comes down through a thick braided cable
ending in a three and a half millimeter
jack which plugs into a USB controller
which then extends to your PC and
connects via USB setup is easy simply
plug and play
there's no accompanying software to go
hand-in-hand with this headset at all
this is a plus in terms of simplicity
but I do think it would have been good
to be able to customize the equalizer
meet profiles for different games and
applications and possibly even supply
the option to turn off the back light of
the HyperX logo the controller itself is
pretty good it looks nice and the
backlit logo and 7.1 mm
actually look pretty cool both the
speaker volume and mic volume buttons
give nice clicky feedback when pressed
and you can slide a switch on the side
to move the mind you can toggle 7.1 on
and off here too and this is actually
pretty important as you want to do so
for stereo audio finally let's check out
the audio quality I was immediately
pleased by the way the music sounded on
this headset the 53 millimeter drivers
deliver a full spacey sound and work
best through the mid ranges highs are
good but not exceptional and the bass is
there but certainly not overwhelming the
cloud tubes are a digital USB headset
and the 7.1 surround sound quite good
while not true 7.1 surround sound as its
processed digitally by the USB sound
card it does work quite well in games
are supported and it offers good
positional feedback I did find however
that the sound was a little less clear
in 7.1 mode and you'll definitely want
to turn it off for things that are in
stereo like Spotify music overall I
really liked the HyperX cloud tools a
lot the unboxing was nice the added
extras are great sound quality was nice
too and they're very comfortable headset
the design is a little no-frills in
terms of looks but certainly some people
prefer that it's a personal preference
type of thing the detachable mark is
great for multiplayer gaming and voice
chat the USB controller has been
executed very well 7.1 surround sounds
not going to satisfy audio files that's
not the target market this is a simple
plug-and-play device that delivers on
all fronts there's really great value to
under 100 US dollars thanks for tuning
in to hardware unbox from another
product view I'm your host Matt and I'd
love to know what you think in the cloud
tools in the comments and on my hardware
