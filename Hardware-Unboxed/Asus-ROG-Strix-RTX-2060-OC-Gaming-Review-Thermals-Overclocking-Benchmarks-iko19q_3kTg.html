checking out what might be the best
geforce r-tx 2060 graphics card
available right now certainly one of the
biggest and it's also one of the most
expensive of course the r-tx 2060 MSRP
is $350 u.s. this thing is $50 more and
at the throne or $50 price there are a
few basic models available but nothing
quite like this having said a lot we
typically recommend that you stick to
the MSRP at least when possible but if
you're keeping the graphics card for no
two to three years is spending the extra
$50 a big deal or more to the point is
it worth it at least in this case you
can clearly see where the extra money is
going whereas the $350 models a little
jewel and single faring cards this beast
has three but really it is more than
that
now this rx 2060 it really has a
high-end cooler it's a two and a half
slot design so it takes up three slots
but this means it does offer 40% more
fin density than the dual slot versions
you can easily mistake this thing for an
arch x28 e2i it's long it's tall and
it's thick oh and it's also really heavy
tipping the scales at 1307 grams the
advantage to all this third part from
looking completely badass in your system
is that it should run very cool quiet
and with a bit of luck overclock like a
champ for those of you wondering the
card measures 300 millimeters long
stands 132 millimeters tall and it is a
whopping 50 millimeters wide the PCB
stretches the entire length and height
of the cooler and on the rear side is
wrapped in a heat spreader or I suppose
in this case a backplate as it doesn't
actually come in contact with a PCB
using any fell or pads so just a
traditional backplate then it does have
a fancy RGB backlit ROG logo though so
that's pretty neat on the front side the
black-and-gray fan shroud features the
typical ROG Strix design and you get 385
millimeter wing blade fans which are I P
5x certified meaning they are dust
resistant moving off the cooler by
removing just six screws reveals
under Sidon here we find two massive
aluminium fin are raised with base
plates for cooling the GPU and vrm the
nickel-plated GPU base plate is quite
thick and there are half a dozen six
millimeter thick copper heat pipes that
transfer heat away from the GPU then the
second rectangular plate is used to
extract heat from the vrm in this case
the 10 power stages this plate features
a thermal pad to make contact with the
components but there is a bit of an
issue here it doesn't cover the entire
power stage and even worse the power my
card wasn't actually installed correctly
half the power stage has had less than
50% of their surface covered this will
no doubt cause these components get much
hotter than they need to I don't suspect
this will cause too many issues for an
RT X 2060 but it could be a real issue
for a higher-end graphics card and a
soos has made this mistake in the past
their Vega 56 and 64 cards suffered from
firearm throttling due to poor quality
control on the thermal pads it's a shame
because this cooler really is a work of
art it's just been let down by poorly
installed they're more pads as for the
GDD r6 memory that's cooled via a large
heat spreader actually the heat spreader
pulls double duty as it's not just used
to cool the memory but also strengthen
the PCB in total it adds a hundred and
fifty-five grams to the cards weight and
it's large surface area makes it very
good for cooling the GDD r6 memory again
the heat spreader doesn't seem to fully
cover the GDD r6 memory chips so I'm not
sure how much of an impact that's gonna
have on operating temperatures but we
will find out shortly
as for the PCB well for an RT X 2060
this thing is massive so there's plenty
of spare room
the only noteworthy additions here is an
additional six pin power input most
models only feature a single 8-pin pal
connector but this is soos model gets an
eight pin plus a 6 pin there's also a
dual BIOS switch that allows the fan
profile to be adjusted from the
performance mode to a quiet mode for my
testing I use the performance mode which
is still exceptionally quiet but the
quiet mode does stop the fans from
spinning entirely when the GPU drops
below 55 degrees using the performance
mode the fans are always spinning but
again the operating volume is very low
then around at the i/o panel there's two
display ports and two HDMI ports most
are TX 2060 cards only feature a single
HDMI with
DisplayPort so this is a slightly
different configuration from a Seuss
anyway enough going over the card I
think it's time to test it out as usual
with our graphics card reviews the focus
is on operating temperatures volume
power consumption and overclocking I
will touch a little bit on
out-of-the-box performance but only in a
few games there's really no need to
benchmark our entire games library first
off I wanted to see how hot the Strix
model gets out of the box so as I often
do I find up F 1 2018 around that thing
on a loop for an hour with an ambient
room temperature of 21 degrees
maintained throughout the testing the
card maxed out at just 62 degrees and
that's 11 degrees cooler than the MSI
gaming Zed model reviewed a few days ago
and then using the silent mode it only
went as high as 66 degrees and still
seven degrees cooler than the MSI gaming
Zed the temperatures all the more
impressive given how quiet the card
around my room has a noise floor of 38
DBA at least with the media that I use
and the Strix was recorded at 39 DBA so
I estimated that it's probably just 2 or
3 DBA louder than the MSI card and that
is with the performance mode immediately
though I don't have the best setup for
accurately measuring these quieter
graphics cards that's something we will
improve over time but personally I
couldn't tell the difference between
gaming with either the MSI or a soos
models they're both very quiet you also
noticed on the f1 2018 footage that the
core held steady at 1980 megahertz and
that was the typical operating frequency
seen across numerous tiles it was also
30 megahertz higher than the MSI card so
not a massive difference I know but it
still maintained our higher core clock
speed while running significantly cooler
as for the GDD r6 memory I measured a
peak surface temperature of just 64
degrees using k-type thermocouple z'
while the vm power stage is picked at
only 54 degrees putting those figures in
context the MSI gaming Zed hits 71
degrees for the GDD i6 memory so it was
7 degrees warmer
while the vrm hit 81 degrees making it
27 degrees hotter MSI uses a tiny little
heat spreader over the verum on the
gaming Zed whereas a sousou's of the
main cooler I was very concerned about
the shoddy thermal pad placement on the
isuzu car but didn't seem to be a
problem and just to be clear I measured
the verum temperature across a number of
our stages but the peak was recorded on
the middle stages which had the least
amount of contact with the thermal pad
anyway these temperatures are
exceptionally good moving on to some
gaming benchmarks we see when playing
shut off the Tomb Raider that the Strix
model is 1 to 2 FPS faster the MSOs
gaming Zed not earth-shattering gains
but it was faster and oddly this is
enough to put it on power the base model
RTX 2070 in this title a man I don't
feel bad about giving the r-tx 2070 a
negative review I turned out to be an
even bigger ripoff than I was expecting
moving on we see the same thing in
strange Brigade we're really looking at
the margin of error here though it is
clear these AIB models are a little
faster than videos found addition the
asou Strix model was again 1 2 FPS
faster the MSI's gaming said though this
time the r-tx 2070 was at least faster
by a decent margin finally we have Forza
horizon for and again just a few frames
in it though this is another title
whether you're su Strix RT x 2060 was
basically matching a base model RT x
2070 overclocking using msi afterburner
went really well the card accepted plus
93 for the core and plus 800 for the
memory with both the power and temp
sliders maxed out this resulted in a
typical operating frequency of 2055
megahertz for the core and 1900 and 70
megahertz for the memory though
afterburner reports the DDR speed as
seven thousand eight hundred and eighty
one megahertz the GPU temperature master
just 59 degrees which was actually three
degrees lower than what we saw out of
the box though the fans were spending
much faster now to keep the cards
temperatures under control but it still
wasn't overly noisy overall a solid
overclock and this is the best result
I've seen from an RT X 2060 and just
lastly wrapping up the testing I have
some quick power consumption numbers
this is total system consumption and
we're testing in the standard GPU test
reproduces the core I know I'm nineteen
ok clocked at five gigahertz with 32
gigabytes of ddr4 memory I have to say
these results are quite surprising
despite operating at a higher frequency
the Zeus ROG Strix consume slightly less
power as soos has obviously fine-tuned
the voltage range here to make their
r-tx 20/60 extremely efficient okay so
the asou ROG Strix RT X 20s
60o see gaming has a bloody long name
and it heavily violates my to word limit
per product but that heinous crime aside
it is pretty good actually it's really
very good it's the best RT x 2060 I've
come across so far and it's possibly the
best on the market it's also very
expensive at $400 u.s. it's a $50
premium over the base model selling at
the MSRP now if this were a GTX 1060
it'd be a hard pass if I'm honest at
that price range $50 more is a 20%
markup but here it's only a 14% premium
and frankly I feel like you are getting
much more value sure it's not 14% faster
but it is much cooler it is quieter and
it gives you a better chance of hitting
higher clock speeds when overclocking
compared to the MSI r-tx 2060 gaming
said that I recently reviewed you get
33% more metal with the asou Strix model
and that enables massive improvements in
operating temperature it's also just $10
more so a measly 3% price hike for 33%
more aluminium I was concerned about the
verum and GDD are six cooling but the
results there were stellar
overall the seuss ROG Strix are checks
2060 OC it really is a beast
the only drawback with this product is
the price but if your budget will allow
for it then I do highly recommend you
get it can't imagine you will be
disappointed it really is a fantastic
card that cooler yeah like I said it's a
beast and you've seen the thermals and
all the results I probably don't need to
go on about it too much more yeah it is
a pretty awesome RTX 2060 I'm very very
impressed with it and I think that is
going to do it for this one if you enjoy
