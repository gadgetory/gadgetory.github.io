I'm your host Matt and today we're
taking a look at Silverstone's latest
mini ITX case the raven are that or to
follow up to one of the best small
form-factor gaming cases we've seen
silver Stern's raven our v01 the rv0 2
carries with it high expectations the
rv0 one was one of the absolute best at
cramming high-end performance hardware
into a very very small package for that
reason it was one of the most preferred
cases for enthusiasts to build their
steam boxes in with its ability to fit
even the mighty geforce gtx titan x
inside now the RV's that r2 has arrived
and also claims to be able to house
graphics cards up to 13 inches long
despite being 15% smaller than its
predecessor overall some or maybe all of
this day of space is due to the fact
that silverstone is not a loud room for
a case fan you'll certainly make
temperature management an interesting
issue especially for those looking to
cram high-performance hardware inside
the RV's that r2 certainly lives up to
the RV's letter 1 in terms of aesthetics
the original is a great-looking case but
in my opinion this latest version is
even better the front panel features
aggressive angles yet remains clean
overall with its subtle Raven logo at
the middle Silverstone has even made
allowance up front for entire panels
wrap around the case at a pretty unique
way and feature opposing ventilated
clear plastic panels that show off
different areas of the internal hardware
the rear of the case is simple but
you'll also notice two expansion slots
meaning this case can support dual with
slight graphics cards popping off the
two case doors reveals a relatively
simple and well-thought-out internal
designs the motherboard tray features a
very large cutout which is great to see
as this rear access allows the easy
installation of m2 SSDs once the system
is already installed next to the
motherboard tray is the power supply
mounting location which supports both
SFX and
zones new SFX our standards above the
power supply's where you'll find the
slim optical drive slot next this slider
to very clever two and a half inch drive
slots that allow users to slide drives
in and out without any tools and most
crucially without removing any other
components turning the case around we
find a dedicated space that can house
full-length 13-inch GPUs like the titan
x silverstone claims installation is
straightforward our experience was in
line with his claims thanks to the well
thought out design previously mentioned
now let's go take a look at what we
installed initially I plan to install my
ads Rock x99 a ICF's AC motherboard in
the rv0 - but with limited room for CPU
cooling the 59 60 X isn't really an
option like it was in the silverstone SG
13 for example still a $1000 processor
might be a little unrealistic anyway so
I went with the core i7 6 to 700 K on
the new asrock fatalities dead 170
gaming ITX AC which seems to be a
popular choice for new high-end Mini ITX
builds keeping the 6700 K coolers that
elegant little Xigmatek Yanis
low-profile cooler which features a 120
millimeter pwm fan that spins it up to
1200 rpm coupled with a smaller 80
millimeter fan underneath that can spin
as fast as 2,000 rpm also installed is
16 gigabytes of Crucial Ballistix ddr4
2666 memory and the Samsung SSD 850 pro
2 terabyte SSD on the backside of the
motherboard in the m2 slot the Samsung
sm 951 nvm a 512 gigabyte SSD has also
been installed finally on the opposite
end the case we've installed a reference
designed nvidia geforce gtx 980ti
graphics card and powering all this mini
ITX madness is the silverstone SX 600 G
which is ample as this system never
draws more than 350 watts when gaming
speaking of which when gaming the GPU
temperature never got above 85 degrees
which is good given it peaks at between
80 to 85 degrees on the test bed the CPU
maxed out at 60 degrees and again this
an excellent temperature when using the
Xigmatek Yanis on the core i7 6700 K all
things considered the RV's no.2 is
silver stones best mini ITX case yet in
my opinion and it might even be the best
steambox case in the market what I
really loved was how accessible
Silverstone made the internal hardware
meaning enthusiasts who like to tweak
and upgrade as they go won't have to go
through a complete system rebuild every
time something that I have to admit
drives me a little crazy with my R v01
the lack of case fans didn't seem to
affect temperatures much at all due to
the case is virtually open-air design
with it's vented side panels this
probably went away towards reducing
overall noise - one thing users will
probably have to remain mindful of
though is dust buildup while this
open-air design is great for cooling it
will be prone to internal dust buildup
and you'll probably want to get some
compressed air in there regularly to
clear things out at just $80 it's great
value and that price makes it very hard
to fault silverstone of anything with
this case if i was building a new steam
box or portable LAN system this case
will probably top my list and i'd have
no troubles recommending it to anyone
looking to do so would you consider the
rv0 - let me know in the comments thanks
