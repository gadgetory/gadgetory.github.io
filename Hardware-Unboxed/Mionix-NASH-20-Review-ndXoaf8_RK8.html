today I'm gonna be taking a closer look
at my own exists at 20 gaming headset
better known for their gaming mice
marnix isn't a huge player in the now
very competitive gaming headset market
and with nothing new for two years now I
decided to check out the aging Nash 20
removing this headset from a simple and
elegant box the first thing I know is
just how bulkier was the extendable
headband is both thick and wide and the
earpieces themselves are large to match
they're also not exactly lightweight
either coming in at 398 grams
they're far from the lighter end of the
spectrum as you'd expect from such a
sizable piece of hardware there are some
advantages to such a bulb you designed
those yes they are heavier than your
average head Zed but the exercise should
mean they fit larger heads like mine
very well it also suggests better build
quality and could point to some serious
hardware inside at first glance you
can't help but notice the chunky memory
foam padding that's found on both the
ear cups and on the headband in both
locations this firm's extremely soft and
pillowy when you place the headset upon
your dome the benefits are immediately
apparent this is such a comfortable
headset I think if they could have been
a little lighter they'd be pushing to be
the most comfortable headset in recent
memory the cloud-like foam is wrapped in
a beautifully soft to touch the leather
and the inner ear cuffs swivel and
rotate the load has spread nice and
evenly around your head oh and the ear
cups are be big enough to fit my ears
entirely with no ear lobe squishing
looks wise the headset is rather simple
and understated
there's no AGB lighting or any lighting
for that matter and the headset is
basically black on black all the way
around the only exception to this is the
mynocks nash 20 logo on top of the
headband the mynocks logo is speech on
the outside of both ear clubs with as
pure black to the top of the headband
and outside of the ear cuffs are made of
plastic and wrapped in my next is 4
layer rubber coating that I believe
found on their awesome cars two mouths
the built-in mic folds down on a single
axis and can be bent inward slightly
when flipped up it automatically mutes
I've used the nash 20s mic to record
this section so you can hear what it
sounds like as you can hear the quality
is nothing special but it does do a
service of a job for multiplayer gaming
the two meter long cable if his analog
heads that is braided let's into a red
and green three-and-a-half millimeter
jack at the end the features no inline
remote whatsoever at first I was
confused thinking there was no way to
adjust volume in the headset itself then
I discovered the clever volume wheel at
the back of the left ear cup similar to
what's found on the Logitech Artemis
spectrum now I've read some complaints
about the national being loud honestly
from my experience I can say they're
simply not true
maybe these users haven't found the
volume wheel in the back of the headset
listening to Spotify with it strapped
onto my head I couldn't bear to go max
volume 75% hurt now this isn't aided by
the fact that this isn't exactly the
most music friendly audio device going
around I mean it is a gaming headset
after all but the seems so heavily pre
tuned for gaming that it's kind of
rendered it ineligible for music and
movies for the discerning listener the
pair of stereo 50 millimeter - drivers
are very flat and simply couldn't handle
or deliver any bass when they tried the
sound was so congested the song sounded
very dull and flat this headset is
certainly better suited to first-person
shooters than symphonies overall I
really liked the solid build quality and
feel of the Nash 20s the 4 layer rubber
coating is delightful to handle and
gives a pretty premium feel and the
pillowy memory foam and the headband and
ear cuffs is wonderful the comfort only
could have been improved with a little
less weight on board unfortunately for
me the sound performance was simply not
up to par for the price which has come
down from 130 dollars to 110 but even so
there are much better sounding solutions
around the same mark these days I
believe the Nash 20 is a from an era
when PC gaming headsets were mostly
rubbish and when compared to recently
release solutions they're clearly
showing their age in my opinion - really
needs to look at what Corsair Logitech
creative and even Kingston have been
doing the headset space and deliver a
more up-to-date product I'd love to hear
what you guys think of the monique's
