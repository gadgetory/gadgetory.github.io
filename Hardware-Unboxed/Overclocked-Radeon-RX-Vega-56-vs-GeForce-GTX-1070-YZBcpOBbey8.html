Vega related video this time we're
overclocking and under vaulting to see
what kind of impact this has on Vega 56s
performance shortly after my 32 game
benchmark comparing the entire Vega line
up to the GeForce 10 series I started
getting spammed with messages from
viewers asking me to do some under vault
testing as they suspect this really
helped to improve Vega sufficiency in
fact the graphs I was sent showed up to
a 22% increase in frame rates while
reducing total system consumption by 20%
what kind of magic is this
this made little sense to me but I was
keen to see what kind of improvements
could be made to Vega with a little
tinkering so for now I've played around
with the air called reference design
Vega 56 graphics card to see if it can
indeed become a GTX 1080 found edition
killer or is that just a fairy tale at
the very least we should get a good idea
of what will be possible with Vega 56
want some more efficiently cooled board
partner cards become available but
before we get into the benchmarks and
the settings used a quick shout-out to
videoblocks for sponsoring this video
so for those of you who aren't familiar
with videoblocks they have one of the
fastest-growing and largest stock video

I'm done watching nature footage at
least for now
because it is time to fine-tune Vega 56
first up I started by reducing the
voltage from 1200 millivolts down to
1017 millivolts and this was an 11
percent reduction in voltage this alone
did reduce power consumption by around
10% but also reduced frame rates by 5 to
10% as well the next step then was to
slightly raise the frequency from 1592
megahertz to 1600 and 12 mega Hertz and
then increase the power limit by 50%
finally the HBM 2 frequency was boosted
from 800 megahertz to 930 mega Hertz and
this is the highest frequency I was able
to stabilize the memory at you'll see
what kind of impact this had on
performance in a moment then for the gtx
1070 fe card i raise the base frequency
from 1500 and six megahertz just
seventeen hundred and six megahertz and
this resulted in a GPU boost 3.0
frequency of around 2000 and fifty
megahertz the memory was also increased
from 8 gigabits per second to nine
gigabits per second finally the core
voltage slider was maxed out at plus
100% and the power limit was set to 112
percent all right so with AMD's
reference model and in videos found
edition model both quite heavily
overclocked how do they compare well
let's go find it out first that we have
battlefield 1 and here the GTX 1070
enjoyed a 15% increase in average frame
rate once overclocked though this only
allowed it to loosely match the stock
vega 56 graphics card overclocking vega
56 increase the frame rates by a further
12 percent and this does indeed allow
AMD's more affordable value graphics
card to match the gtx 1080 at least for
the average frame rate moving on we have
the dawn of all three results and here
the overclocked gtx 1070 boosted frame
rates by just 7% vega 56 did slightly
better as an improved the average frame
rate by 9%
and that placed it roughly on par with
vega 64 and well ahead of the gtx 1080
so a solid result here for Vega it's not
a massive 20% increase but we'll take it
nonetheless Vega is already proven to be
mighty impressive in dirt 4 and here we
see once overclocked vega 56 is able to
match a vega 64 with an impressive 1
119 FPS and that makes it much faster
than the GTX 1080 and world's faster
than the gtx 1070 meanwhile the GeForce
graphics card only saw a boost of 6%
once overclocked moving on the gains in
Doom are fairly mild the GTX 1070 was 6%
faster once overclocked and Vega 56 was
7% faster even so the overclock did
allow Vega 56 to catch the stock GTX
1080 in this test so not bad but not
amazing either that's it with frame
rates in excess of a hundred and thirty
FPS at all times I'm not sure how much
it matters anyway the gains seen in Far
Cry primal were mild at best - though
better than those seen previously in
Doom the gtx 1070 enjoyed a 9% bump in
frame rate while vega 56 did hit double
digits with an 11% increase now pushing
over ninety FPS on average vega 56 is
quite impressive though not a gtx 1080
killer here when testing with fir on a--
we did see a very healthy 15% boost in
performance for vega 56 and it is now
delivering air-cooled vega 64 like
numbers the gtx 1070 wasn't quite as
impressive and overclocked it did fall
further behind vega 56 both the gtx 1070
and vega 56 GPUs saw a measly gains in
Mass Effect Andromeda around 5% more
frames on average were seen here
overclocked the margins between these
two GPUs remained much the same and they
did both turn in results that were lower
than that of the GTX 1080 in this title
moving on to the Mirror's Edge catalyst
results the gtx 1070 was boosted by just
4 percent once overclocked meanwhile
vega 56 spat out 8 percent more frames
and was seen delivering vegas 64 light
performance and wasn't much slower than
the gtx 1080 here overclocking vega 56
does certainly help with performance in
overwatch and while it trails the gtx
1070 in the margin is slightly reduced
at least when looking at the average
frame rate the 1% low results are still
concerning but at well over 100 FPS it's
probably not really a big deal testing
with prey the results are much the same
once overclocked though vega 56 is 1%
low result is more impressive now and
match that of the air-cooled vega 64 GPU
overall we did see an 8% increase in
frame rates of vega 56 once overclocked
both GPU see a 6 percent increase in
average
once overclocked when we're testing with
Resident Evil 7 and this was enough of a
go 56 to match the GTX 1080 a stock GT X
1080 I should add but still an
impressive result all the same the gain
seen in Titan folds who were very
mineral for both the GTX 1070 and Vega
56 GPUs if we'd seen more results like
this though we'd have to conclude that
it's really not worth the time invested
to overclock these GPUs nearing the end
of the benchmarks we have rise of the
Tomb Raider and we see an 8% increase
for Vega 56 and just 6% for the gtx 1070
certainly not mind-blowing results I'll
admit but Vega 56 is now able to match
the air-cooled Vega 64 graphics card
finally we have Ghost Recon wildlands
and again some more mild gains can be
seen and they're not really worth
getting excited over so then I'm gonna
wrap up the FPS testing here and let's
move on to check out the power
consumption figures ok I can't say these
results are at all surprising but given
the graphs many of you are showing me it
might surprise some of you so out of the
box Vega 56 pushed total system
consumption a little over 30% higher
than that of the GTX 1017 certainly not
a good result but since it was generally
a little faster it's not the end of the
world either
however overclock the gtx 1070 sucked
down just 11% more power and that minute
still consumed a lot less than the stock
vega 56 graphics card under vaulting and
then overclocking vega 56 did certainly
improve performance by anywhere from 5
to 15 percent depending on the title but
it also increased total system
consumption by an insane 35 percent that
explains why the blower fan was
screaming like a jet okay so based on
that it doesn't really seem like under
vaulting slash overclocking Vega really
changes position against the competing
g-force 10 Series products overall Vega
56 saw an eight percent boost in average
frame rate from our tweaks while the gtx
1070 saw a seven percent boost so really
much of a muchness there however
probably more importantly while the gtx
1070 only saw an 11 percent increase in
power consumption vega 56
saw a 35 percent increase
so while we succeeded in making both
faster we did make the gtx 1070 slightly
less efficient while making vega 56
miles less efficient since the aim is to
improve efficiency here at least I
believe that's what many are getting
excited about when it comes to Vega
under vaulting it's not really the case
there's no doubt room to improve on
efficiency here at least slightly while
keeping the performance of Vega 56
pretty close to what you get out of the
box of course gains will vary from card
to card though and I certainly can't see
you slashing power usage by 20% while
maintaining stock performance still if
we look at the results seen in
battlefield 1 Dawn of War 3 and dirt
fall for example then there is a chance
Vega 56 could come out well on top down
the track of course it's yet to be seen
but in terms of outright performance I'd
bet Vega 56 winning out pretty
comfortably in the long run as for
efficiency I am Not sure that's a battle
that can be or ever will be won but for
most gamers it's probably not really an
issue
anyway that's gonna do it for this one I
hope you guys found the results
interesting slash useful and hopefully
they will tie you over till we get some
board partner cards on deck and finally
a big thanks to videoblocks for
