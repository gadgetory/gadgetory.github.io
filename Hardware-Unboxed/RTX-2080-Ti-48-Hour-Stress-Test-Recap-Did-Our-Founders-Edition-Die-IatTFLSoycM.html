today's video we're recapping what
happened in our 48-hour NVIDIA GeForce
r-tx 20 atti founders Asian stress test
which a surprising number of you guys
watched for some reason you wanted to
see a boring screen of a benchmark
looping for hours on end a lot of you
were hoping to see a die or catch fire
midstream but at least a healthy bunch
of you enjoyed the Q&amp;amp;A we ran at the
start of the stream for a couple of
hours so a quick recap of what we were
doing in the stream and why we did it so
basically we ran our 20 atti
founders edition card and stock clocks
in a unit in heaven loop for 48 hours to
stress test it and see if the card would
fail we wanted to test this after
reports that hard OCP had a fair
resolution card died under similar
circumstances our card showed no signs
of failing up until this point so no
Space Invaders artifacts or any other
issues but there was a slim chance that
running at high temperatures for a long
period of time would cause a failure due
to one of the components degrading again
I'll setup had the card running in stock
a lot of people were questioning why the
card wasn't overclocked
but that really wasn't the point of the
test we merely wanted to see if the card
would die under standard operating
conditions we know cards can die when
overclocked the interest was whether the
card would die in and out of the box
type configuration the card was in our
core i7 8700 k test rig with the cpu
also not overcooked and fan speeds were
set to order anyway at this point you're
probably wondering did the card die and
the outs of people that understandably
couldn't be bothered watching until the
end of the stream is not sorry to have
people who helped want the card to die
it was very unlikely to happen and in
the end it just didn't happen there were
no artifacts spotted in the entire 48
hours of live streaming and the card
still functioned perfectly after
rebooting the system in fact it's
running here it's all fine no problems
this was despite the cards sitting at
around 84 degrees Celsius for a full 48
hours except for one minor interruption
with backplate temperatures measured
through a thermocouple comfortably
sitting in the 70 to 75 degrees Celsius
range that's certainly quite
for a GPU but not hot enough to get it
to malfunction or die the card not dying
does present a bunch of interesting
discussion points though neither Steve
no I expected the card to die during the
test in fact we mentioned we'd be
shocked if something broke under these
conditions but it seems a number of
people in the chat wander the impression
that there was a very good chance this
sort of test could kill a card like the
RT X xx atti so let's talk about that
firstly despite the negative press
surrounding the RT X xx hei and its
various failures not every card is
destined to fail even though our card
worshipped to us before launch and
presumably came from an early batch
before any issues were identified it was
never a situation where you buy one
these cards and you're guaranteed to
receive a dud everything we've heard so
far still suggests the failures have
been a minority of card shipped a
concerning minority for sure considering
the amount of people reporting issues
which seems higher than past flagship GP
launches but a minority nonetheless in
our case the RT X xx atti in videos
shipped us to review is a good unit that
works perfectly fine under standard
operating conditions I'm sure there are
plenty of other people out there in a
similar position they've bought a
founders edition model it arrived and
luckily it works without any problems
especially if you don't see any space
invaders artifacts after a few hours
it's highly likely the card is a good
one and will remain functional for years
so point number one is simply that not
every RT X 28 Ajay founders edition all
died simply because it's an RT X 28 I
found his Edition point number two is
that something I guess that cropped up
numerous times in the chat as a bit of a
misconception that running a graphics
card at hot temperatures will cause it
to fail even if it's stock clocks which
is not the case our card ran for the
entire 48 hours between 84 and 86
degrees Celsius on the GPU and a
scorching 70 to 75 degrees Celsius on
the back light from ambient room
temperatures between 19 and 25 degrees
Celsius and reasonably slow case fan
speed set to their silent mode
the backplate reaching the mid seventies
is certainly far too hot to touch and
GPU temperatures in the mid 80s isn't
great you normally want the card running
a bit cooler to get the most out of
invidious GPU boost algorithm but simply
running at hot temperatures like this
isn't going to cause the card to die
unless you modify the card settings
through overclocking or other me
in fact the card is actually designed to
be run around the 84 to 86 degrees
Celsius mark it's the point at which the
cards temperature protection algorithms
kick in and begin reducing clock speeds
to prevent any higher temperatures it's
all a full thermal throttle like you
might see on a CPU hitting t.j.maxx but
NVIDIA GPUs begin gently clocking down
or at least not boosting as high around
that 86 degrees point no doubt the cards
can actually run hotter and in fact do
if you up the thermal limit in your
overclocking software this is a basic
fact about modern hardware design if you
don't touch anything a component running
under stock conditions will manage
itself to prevent damage GPUs are one
such component where this is true but
you also see it across CPUs motherboards
and all sorts of other PC hardware of
course there are lots of reasons why
running a GPU at a cooler temperature is
better you get less power leakage so the
card will run more efficiently and waste
less power at lower temperatures you'll
have more overclocking Headroom because
of this and in the case of NVIDIA GPUs
their GPU boost algorithm will push the
cars higher when temperatures are lower
with even something like a 5 degree
difference allowing for higher clocks
cards running cooler will also degrade
slower we're not talking about
short-term degradation here though we're
talking about after years and years of
use you might get a bit of extra life
out of a card that's run cooler than one
running near its thermal limits again
GPUs are designed to be run near the
limit for years on end though so simply
running a card at hot temperatures isn't
gonna cause an immediate failure and
this is clearly the case without our
text when a heavy ti here running the
card at high temperatures for 48 hours
well basically did nothing for it short
term usability still works fine in fact
nothing has really changed compared to
when we first use the card will this
test impact the 2082 ice overall
lifespan well probably not in any
significant way and it certainly be too
early to tell if it did the final point
is simply that yes you can run a card at
a hundred percent utilization for days
on end and run into zero issues miners
of course have already proved this but a
few people seem to think that you need
to let the card
rest and cool down periodically as a
typical gamer would between gaming
sessions but GPUs are designed to
operate continuously and there's really
no magic timer dictating how long you
can use it before it needs a rest the
good news for us is that our art x20
atti founders Edition has now
essentially been validated to work
perfectly so we can continue using it
without any fear of immediate death or
needing to go through an RMA process it
also shows to you guys that yes if you
buy an art x20 atti with founders
edition PCB there's a realistic and
highly probable chance that it will work
just as well as any other GPU you've
owned in the past at the same time this
doesn't really give any additional
insight into why some art X 2082 eyes
have been failing and we didn't expect
the test to provide any additional
information anyway one card you know
it's never going to be enough of a
sample size to generate any sort of
concrete information and it still seems
at this point we really don't know
what's going on we certainly don't
expect Nvidia to provide us with a
reason at least publicly if you are
wondering whether your and Vidya r-tx
card is fine we recommend running a
stress test like this for around 12
hours the art X 2080 the didone are
started to show artifacting around six
hours in so if it passes a half-day test
it should be fine from that point onward
you shouldn't have to worry about the
card Ram we die at least you shouldn't
have to worry about that any more than
with any other GPU and that just about
wraps up this live stream experiment we
had a bit of fun chatting with you guys
live and hopefully we'll be doing more
live streams in the future considering
how well this one went and of course
we'll continue to have our monthly live
streams with both myself and Steve
exclusive for our patreon members so if
you want that more casual type of stream
where we just chat about cool stuff in
tech sign up to our patreon and you'll
get access to our exclusive discord chat
while you're at it time to switch off
the test system and give the artex 2082
eye a bit of a rest I said it wasn't
actually necessary but my power bill
will thank me later that's for sure
because it is subscribing for more fun
or in this case boring content straight
in your inbox I'll catch you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
