out creative soundblaster e5 a USB DAC
and portable headphone amplifier I
really liked the sound profile for
gaming the built-in battery and the
wealth of connectivity options today I
have on hand the Sound Blaster XG 5 a
7.1 surround sound portable sound card
and headphone amplifier this packaged up
is a very similar looking unit with some
very distinct differences with the
blaster X branded g5 creative a
specifically targeting audio sensitive
gamers not only on the PC platform the
console game is to claim it can provide
the best-in-class console gaming audio
I'm really reviewing this from a PC
gamers perspective but before we dive
into all of that let's check out the
design and aesthetics as mentioned the
g5 is very similar looking to there 5
its shell is all-black with the same
soft rubber padding on the bottom and a
big wheel on the front this time though
the big wheel features a very cool
illuminated volume indicator that
increases with brightness as we increase
the volume next to this wheel or two
three-and-a-half millimeter jacks one
for your headphones and one for your
microphone heading around to the back of
the unit you'll find the micro USB port
with which you use the supplied USB
cable to connect to either your PC or
gaming console next to this is a USB
device port as well as an optical import
and optically out port on the left hand
side the remaining controls for the
device including the Scout Murray button
Sound Blaster X Pro file switching
button and a low high gain toggle switch
rounding out the design is a very cool
looking Sound Blaster X logo on top with
an also illuminated red X when the
device is powered now internally the g5
is a beast in terms of headphone
amplification it packs the same Texas
Instruments amp that the e5 before it
did capable of driving headphones up to
a 600 ohm impedance also in line with
the e5 is the Cirrus Logic digital audio
converter which supports high resolution
player back up to 24-bit or 192
kilohertz and also has a signal-to-noise
ratio of 120 decibels for audio
enhancement creative is also included
its popular s be a double x1 audio
processor which can be controlled by the
previously mentioned scalp mode and SPX
buttons on the side of the unit as well
as within creatives
company software the Blaster X acoustic
engine pro software is a real strength
of the package it's powerful polished
and very intuitive on the profile page
you can configure a variety of different
presets and assign them to the three
profile slots they can be switched
between on the flyer using the FBX
button on the g5 itself creative is
included presets such as first-person
shooter adventure in action driving
simulation and even specific ones for
the Call of Duty series dota 2 and csgo
there are 17 presets in total included
in the software then you can
additionally create your own and import
others pretty comprehensive if you ask
me on the acoustic engine page you can
play around with the blaster axe
acoustic engine enhancements and
customize them if you selected profile
this tab also allows you to preview
three types of sound for immediate
feedback after your settings tweaks the
next tab is the simple equaliser where
there are also a variety of presets to
choose from and then you kind of course
create and save your own the Scout mode
tab simply allows you to toggle on and
off the Scout mode a technology that
alters the sound profile to help you
hear enemies from further away in order
to give you an advantage in first-person
shooters in particular additionally you
can configure a hotkey to switch this on
and off and of course as I mentioned
earlier you can toggle Scout mode on the
unit itself with the dedicated button
voice FX is the next tab and this is
really just to mess around
there's a variety of funny voice filters
that you can apply and they're actually
surprisingly good my favorites included
diamond male to female yes this is what
I would sound like as a lady apparently
finally with the advanced setting page
you can configure and test the surround
sound mode and customize all sound
levels in the mixer on the home page
also allows you to change the volume and
do a cool surround sound demo with a
helicopter the sound performance is
great as you'd expect and with any
decent pair of headphones you're going
to notice a big difference compared to
onboard audio the clarity range and
detail is significantly better for music
movies and especially gaming directional
awareness is the main advantage but
you're also able to detect additional
details that just weren't there before
overall the Sound Blaster XG 5 is a
great portable audio upgrade for gamers
with a discerning hear the sound
performance is fantastic the acoustic
engine software is powerful and polished
and the customization the entire package
office is really unrivaled coming in at
a reasonable one
30 US dollars or 300 Australian dollars
from creative Australia's website it
represents great value in the USA and I
would expect prices to be a lot lower in
Australia once it's available from local
retailers I see the g5s main competition
being creatives very similar
soundblaster 85 which comes with a few
extra features and an internal battery
to aid portability but does come in at a
little over 50 US dollars more expensive
right now thanks for joining me for
another hardware unbox product review
I'm your host Matt as always I'll see
you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
