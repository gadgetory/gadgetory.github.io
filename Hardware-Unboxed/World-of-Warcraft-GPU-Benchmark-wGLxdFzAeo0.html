such as Deus Ex mankind divided I like
to put together some kind of performance
video as many of you might know last
night on the 30th of August the later
six expansion in the set of massively
multiplayer online role-playing game
series World of Warcraft landed the
expansion raises the existing level cap
from 100 to 110 features artifact
weapons for each class of
specializations includes a new area on
Azeroth called the Birkin Isles and
introduces the demon hunter hero class
that starts at level 98 it will
initially include 10 five-man dungeons
and 2 raids admittedly I'm not a World
of Warcraft player and as such I haven't
spent any time with it in the last
decade so that being the case this is a
game I typically skip however so many of
you guys have asked that I check out
this latest expansion and creative
performance video that I felt compelled
to do so so here we are
Blizzard was kind enough to provide me
with access to the game a week in
advance which has helped me get this
video out so promptly testing takes
place in Warsong village which lies over
the mountains and due west of the
training grounds on the wandering Isle
the village has been overrun with
annoying hosen who are stealing up the
supplies while attacking the villagers
the fraps run lasts 60 seconds and as
you're about to see the framerate does
vary quite a lot here due to the amount
of graphics cards tested I've only
included three resolutions using a
single quality setting that being the
max settings with CMAA enabled the aim
was to include as many current and
previous generation GPUs as possible 17
GPUs were tested 9 radians and a geforce
cards all of which were tested in my
standard core i7 test system rig with
all that said let's get into the
benchmarks as expected even with the
maximum in-game quality settings enabled
World of Warcraft Legion isn't
particularly demanding at 1080p the
Radeon rx 460 for example average 65 FPS
with a 52 FPS minimum while the gtx 950
was a few frames faster after that we
find GPUs such as the gtx 960 breaking
the 90 FPS barrier increasing the
resolution to 1440p we find that the rx
460 and gtx 950 drop down to around 40
FPS on average which is still playable
though input lags now noticeable jumping
up to the gtx 960 and 9380 we found
very smooth 60 plus frames per second on
average as expected again the lower end
GPUs weren't cutted at the extreme 4k
resolution in fact those targeting 60fps
here will require GeForce GTX 1060 or r9
nano the gtx 980ti was a good bit faster
than the Furious while the GTX 1070 and
1080 provided the best results so the
results are very much what I was
expecting to find even with a little Nu
about the game graphically the games
been much improved since its debut back
in 2004 but when compared to other
modern triple-a titles what you'll see
in the Legion expansion is very basic
it's definitely designed to run on lower
spec systems which makes sense
Blizzard won't want to suddenly make
half their customer base have to upgrade
just to play it is worth noting that
game is more demanding for the raids on
both the GPU and CPU though accurately
testing this many different hardware
configurations while in a raid is next
to impossible nevertheless I feel for
the most part those rocking a decent
processors should expect similar
performance to what's been shown here
how many of you wow guys do you want to
see more coverage like this let me know
