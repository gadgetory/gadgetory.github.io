video is a look at RGB memory but hang
in there because it's got liquid in it
well it's not in it it's it's on top of
it and this clear bit at the top here
yeah it's kind of weird
so in April a data announced their new
spectryx dat ddr4 RGB liquid cooling
memory and as the name suggests it packs
both RGB lighting and liquid what more
could you ask for in a set of memory
modules I hate to think formally known
as project jellyfish we don't know why
they actually changed the name because
well that is a way shorter and more
catchy name in my opinion anyway
spectryx dat is it and the new memory
will be available in a wide range of
options on hand for testing we have the
32 gigabyte ddr4 3600 packing four
modules in total I've got another one
here and I've got one that I pulled
apart and they are rated for CL 17 18 18
timings at 1.3 5 volts design-wise they
are unusual as you might expect the
profile though is pretty typical for
your more high-end memories they stand
forty six point six millimeters tall so
very similar to the g.skill Sniper X
memory for example when it comes to sort
of the more technical stuff a data
doesn't really give away too much on
their website you worried that they are
indeed liquid-cooled using non
conductive fluid with a low boiling
point to dissipate the heat effectively
no technical information on the liquid
those given and I have asked a data but
they haven't got back to me with that
information yet they also point out the
liquid is hermetically sealed and
basically that's a fancy way of saying
that it shouldn't leak or fart all over
the place speaking of emitting wind the
phase change process absorbs a lot of
thermal energy and here is intended to
take heat away from the PCB and memory
chips connected to a clear tube on top
of the modules is a thin aluminium heat
spreader the heat spreader is connected
to the surface of the memory chips via a
thin adhesive thermal pad and it then
transfers heat to the liquid via two
small tabs at either end since this is
just single sided memory there is just
one black heat spreader that connects to
liquid to the opposite side features a
decorative red piece of aluminium and
this strip is also found on the front
side it covers the black heat spreader
on the front side and again is locked
into position using some double-sided
adhesive for those of you wondering a
data is using Samsung's K for a 8g 0-8
ICS otherwise known as samsung video
memory so if you drop them down to DDR
3400 for example you will be able to run
them at the advanced timings that we've
been testing second generalize and
processes with when compared to the
g.skill Sniper X ddr4 3,600 memory that
I've been using for testing Verizon the
spectryx Dae offers much tighter timings
out of the box I won't give you a full
rundown but you can quite clearly see
how they compare here on the screen in
this little table that I've made before
we get to testing out how well the
liquid cooling works let's take a quick
look at the RGB lighting embedded on the
opposite side of the PCB from the memory
ICS a10 RGB LED lights and these
illuminate the clear strip that runs
across the top of the modules containing
the liquid the clear plastic has been
given a slight tint which helps make the
effect a little more discreet ADATA
offers their RGB sync software for
controlling the lighting effects but
alternatively you can use your
motherboards lighting software provided
you're using import from asrock msi
gigabyte or a soos personally I think
the RGB lighting effects look okay but
it's certainly not the best looking RGB
memory that I've seen of course this is
completely subjective but there are
quite a few alternatives that I do
prefer of course the real draw card here
is the liquid cooling so what does it
really have to offer well honestly not a
lot but I'm sure that probably doesn't
surprise that many of you ddr4 memory at
one point three five volts doesn't get
particularly hot and to be honest
doesn't require any form of cooling at
all so those heats read as you see I'm
pretty much all the high-end desktop
memory and mostly just there for show
unfortunately the thermal sensor that
allows monitoring via software such as
Hardware info has been disabled on the a
data memory so while I could easily
monitor the g.skill Sniper X memory vice
software I couldn't do the same with
this spectryx dat memory so I got at the
thermal gun and measured surface
temperatures after an hour long Ida 64
memory stress
just inside the Corsair crystal 570 X
test system this means that the memory
Isis are likely getting a bit hotter
than what I'm reporting here but not
much hotter with an ambient air
temperature of 21 degrees the sniper X
memory maxed out at just 32 degrees when
fed one point four volts under the same
conditions the spectryx dat memory was
an entire degree cooler just one degree
it's actually hard to say if that's an
improvement at all certainly within the
margin of error I decided to test again
but this time with all forms of cooling
removed leaving the memory chips
completely exposed this saw the low
temperature increased by just three
degrees
yep a whole three degrees taking the
peak surface temperature to just thirty
four degrees so as expected liquid
cooling ddr4 memory is a bit pointless
even if ddr4 memory around twice as hot
as it actually does I'm not convinced a
doubt a solution would actually help
certainly no more than a proper finned
heat sink in fact I'm willing to bet it
would probably be worse so a bit of a
gimmick there to be honest but at least
the memory does come with some pretty
impressive timings out of the box the
only other issue I see for this memory
could be the price I expect that you
will pay a bit of a premium for the
liquid in the top but we don't really
know just yet because availability is
quite weak so yeah hopefully pricing is
competitive though the only other issue
I have with these spectryx dat is the
fact that they've wrapped RGB memory
with red heat spreaders have you learned
nothing from MSI it's really going to be
black or white there's no other option
for RGB memory and anything else such as
this red stuff just defeats the purpose
and as silly as it sounds I really feel
like these red heat spreaders are really
going to hurt sales of this memory and
that is going to do it for now if you
