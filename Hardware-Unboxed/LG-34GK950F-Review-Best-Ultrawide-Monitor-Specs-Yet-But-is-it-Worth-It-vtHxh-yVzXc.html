checking out one of the most heavily
requested LG gaming monitors I've been
seeing requests to check out this bad
boys since I think it was late last year
which is when it went on sale I'm of
course talking about the LG 34 GK 950 F
it's in the title after all and from a
lot of angles this is a pretty
interesting display that I'm glad to
finally have some hands-on time with so
this is LG's highest and gaming Ultra
wired right now it's 34 inches in size
and uses a 34 40 by 1440 IPS panel with
a 1900 hour curvature crucially this
display supports up to a 144 Hertz
refresh rate making it the highest
refresh monitor at this resolution all
thanks to that new LG panel it's
actually higher clocked than the
equivalent g-sync variant the tops out
at 120 Hertz
although judo Nvidia now supporting free
sync owners of an NVIDIA GPU can also
now use the 34 GK 950 F and up to 144
Hertz with adaptive sync aside from the
gaming features this display is using
LG's nano IPS technology which allows
for 98% DCI p3 coverage so it's
comfortably a wide gamut display you're
also getting free sync - and what LG
claims is HDR with display HDR 400
certification although this isn't really
an HDR display and I'll get to that a
bit later on all of these features come
at a pretty high price LG is selling
this display for 1200 US dollars and it
seems it's quite popular as it's on
backorder at most retailers that's more
expensive than the G sync option on
Amazon right now and also quite a bit
more expensive than most other ultra
Wired's of this type I'm guessing the
justification here is it has HDR and an
exclusively high refresh rate but we'll
talk about how this monitor is
positioned in the market after all of
the testing let's kick things off by
looking at the design LG is using a very
similar build to most of their current
ultra gear gaming monitors here so it
means it's simple minimalist and uses
mostly basic matte black plastic for its
construction there are a couple of red
highlights on the stand and on the rear
of the display but it's not overly gamer
in style at the
same time I wouldn't call it a
particularly high in design many of its
competitors use full metal stands while
the 34 GK 950 F is mostly plastic and
that may be off-putting to some buyers
considering the price tag is over $1000
the stand is pretty adjustable
supporting swivel tilt and height
adjustment the way height adjustability
is achieved us through this unique
sheath design which didn't look very
effective at first glance but it's
actually quite stable and reliable in
fact the entire stand is very sturdy and
supports the wide display area very well
all the ports are found directly on the
back panel and there's very little in
the way of cable management
you do get a DisplayPort input plus two
HDMI port two USB 3.0 hub and a 3.5
millimeter audio output jack so a
standard arrangement for a gaming
display you'll need to use DisplayPort
if you want adaptive sync with an NVIDIA
GPU you have the good feature is the
inclusion of a directional toggle to
navigate through the on-screen menus
this makes accessing all the options
very easy and in fact the entire menu
system is very responsive on this
display more so than other monitors the
feature set is also quite typical
including all your basic color controls
plus cheat crosshairs shadow boosting
features and a number of gaming modes
before speaking about performance
there's a few things you should know
about this monitor the first is that
there's a crucial firmware update
available that improves input latency
you should download and install that
through LG's on screen control utility
if you buy one secondly you should
enable the free sync extended mode for
the best performance
I didn't spot any flickering but
enabling this is required to get
adaptive sync working and it's disabled
by default of course one of the major
selling points to this display is its
ability to push up to 144 Hertz
rather than 120 or a hundred Hertz like
previous 34 40 by 1440 displays the good
news is that response times are fast
enough to allow a proper 144 Hertz
experience I recorded a great a great
average transition of just over 6.0
milliseconds with the majority of
transitions tested falling inside the
6.9 for millisecond refresh window
that's required for a 144 Hertz display
this was using the fast overdrive mode
as the faster mode introduced a bit of
overshoot the recent response times are
important here is at 34 inch 34 40 by 40
40 panels
available in two panel technologies IPS
and VA this lg monitor uses an IPS panel
but had they opted for VA instead it's
unlikely that 144 Hertz would have been
achievable the air panels often have
response times up around eight
milliseconds which is fine for a hundred
Hertz but effectively becomes a
bottleneck at 144 Hertz that prevents
you from getting a true 144 Hertz
experience LG using IPS II with its
inherently faster response times opens
up 144 Hertz as a possibility and I'm
happy to verify
there's no response time bottleneck with
this panel while the panel can properly
do 144 Hertz I'm sure you're wondering
whether 144 Hertz is any better than 120
or 100 Hertz especially as monitors
using those refresh rates are cheaper I
don't think it's much of an upgrade over
120 Hertz we're talking only about a 1.4
milliseconds difference but I do feel
it's a noticeable step above 100 Hertz
with that said one option is best could
also come down to your PC hardware
because 3440 by 1440 and above 100 FPS
can be hard to achieve with all but
top-end components the faster LG option
could give you better longevity while a
100 Hertz monitor could be better for
today these are the things you'll have
to weigh up depending on your setup and
needs also worth mentioning is this
monitor packs a 48 to 144 Hertz refresh
rate range with low frame rate
compensation support effectively
removing that minimum value I found no
issues with the adaptive sync experience
here it works very well with hardware
from AMD and NVIDIA input latency with
the latest firmware update was very good
at an estimated 2.4 milliseconds without
the update you'll be stuck with lag over
10 milliseconds which is poor for a
gaming grade monitor which is why
installing the update is something worth
doing combined display latency doesn't
quite reach that of at again but overall
the IPS based 34 GK 950 F is one of the
more responsive monitors I've tested
recently while the use of an IPS panel
does allow LG to hit a maximum 144 Hertz
refresh rate the downside compared to a
slower VA is in the contrast ratio the
34 GK 950 F clocks in around 950 to one
which is around the mark of other IPS
ultra whites like the Acer predator x 34
however you can easily get double the
contrast ratio with an ultra-wide VA the
particular ultra-wide VA pounds I've
tested haven't been at the high end of
what VA can achieve but there's still a
big contrast advantage to VA brightness
from the 34 GK 950 F is pretty good for
SDR at 316 it's with no roll-off to
brightness or contrast at different
window sizes or conditions I also didn't
experience much IPS glow with this panel
which is definitely a good thing and a
key complaint that a lot of IPs buyers
can make as this is a wide gamut display
there's naturally a few complications
around color performance by default the
monitor ships with its gamut unclamped
this means that if you're reviewing
regular content on your PC the display
will over saturate everything as it
expands srgb content which is the vast
majority of content you'll be viewing
into the DCI p3 color space as you can
see this unclamped gamut leads to delta
ii averages between 3.0 and 3.5 in our
saturation and color checker tests when
testing against srgb nothing unusual
here for a wide gamut display we're also
getting a white point of around 7,000 K
which is a little cold although a
grayscale Delta a average of two point
four three isn't terrible for a default
experience while the default behavior
isn't accurate - srgb
it actually does a decent job with
matching DCI p3 in fact with just a few
OSD tweaks to fix up the white point I
was able to achieve sub 2.0 Delta ease
when testing against DCI p3 this is a
great result for working with wide gamut
content although again most content
isn't wide gamut so you won't get the
benefit of this accuracy and instead
you'll be left with over saturation with
srgb content however LG does offer an
sRGB mode which thankfully clamps the
gamut down to srgb
but this mode is far from perfect the
fatal mistake LG has made is restricting
access to color temperature settings
when in the srgb mode luckily you can
change brightness which is something
other OEMs also restricts however the
lack of color temperature controls
within the srgb mode means you basically
have to hope you are receiving a
perfectly calibrated srgb mode from the
factory with my review unit this wasn't
the case
the srgb mode gave the display and
noticeable yellow tint which is
reflected in the 61 34 KCT
average and greyscale delta-e average of
four point four six and while the gamut
is clamped so we aren't getting over
saturation color Delta e averages are
still above two point O because of this
incorrect white point and this is pretty
frustrating because if LG allowed users
to change the white point while using
the srgb mode you'd be able to fix this
problem and have near-perfect
srgb performance my advice to monitor
makers is definitely to still include an
sRGB mode that clamps down the gamut and
attempts srgb accuracy but still make
the fine color controls accessible so
that users can correct inconsistencies
when they receive the unit so for buyers
without a calibration tool what you're
left with is one of two situations a
default mode with a correctable white
point and good DCI p3 accuracy but over
saturation for srgb content and an sRGB
mode that fixes the over saturation but
has poor and unfixable white points this
isn't the worse situation to be in and
for gamers I think the default
experience is probably fine but it isn't
ideal either for those that do have a
calibration tool there's actually a lot
that can be done here with the default
mode we can easily create a wide gamut
display profile that is accurate for
both DCI p3 and srgb which is perfect
for color managed apps like Photoshop
although in unmanaged apps like the
Windows desktop you'll still get that
over saturation but then we can also
create an S RGB mode display profile
that fixes the white point in that mode
while keeping the gamut clamped in any
application in the end you can switch
between the two modes and profiles using
the srgb mode combination for regular
usage and the default wide gamut mode
whenever you are working with wide gamut
content it doesn't have the convenience
that a properly calibrated professional
display would have but since LG is
giving you a full wide gamut panel here
it's nice and in some situations you can
use it and of course some people may
want that oversaturated srgb look anyway
in which case you'll be very happy with
the performance and vibrance of this
panel if you are a member of our patreon
page you can download both profiles I
created for this display over there it
won't be perfectly accurate for every
unit shooter panel variances but it
might be useful if you want to sneak
closer to accuracy without buying
calibration tools before talking about
HDR I want to talk about uniformity
because this is another advantage IPS
ultralights have over their VA
counterparts the 34 gk 950 f is a pretty
uniform monitor for something that's
both curved and 21:9 factors that
usually work against uniformity the
center zone is excellent and even the
outer areas only just sneak over a delta
ii of 2.0 relative to the center in most
cases this is an outstanding result of
this type of monitor far better than any
code VA or oxford VA i have tested the
only major downside to this monitor is
its HDR performance the 34 g can 950 F
is incapable of properly displaying HDR
content because it fails two of the
three key performance metrics for proper
HDR it can display upwards of ninety
five percent of the DCI p3 spectrum so
we are getting a greater than s RGB
color gamut but peak brightness tops out
at just 400 nits which is too low for
displaying the bright highlights of HDR
content I recommend at least 600 nits
here more importantly the 34 GK 950 F
spectacularly fails in contrast which is
the most important feature of an HDR
display there is no local dimming here
so all we are getting is this IPS panels
weak 950 to 1 contrast ratio in HDR
scenes this simply is not good enough
for showing HDR content where if I was
being generous I'd maybe permit a 5,000
to 1 ratio but really would be looking
for at least 10,000 to 1 this monitor
shouldn't be advertised as supporting
HDI it's something I'd completely ignore
when making your buying decision and
again it throws into question the
worthless display HDR 400 certification
even more bizarre is the fact
AMD certified this as free sync to
complaint the certification standards
really are not tight enough if this sort
of display is passing HDR aside there's
plenty to like about the LG 30 40 came
down for fear from a hardware
perspective it's got the fastest refresh
rate we've seen at this resolution and
the response times and input latency to
back it up the design is simple yet
pretty effective the use of an IPS
display has led to excellent uniformity
and a nice wired gamut and I just really
like this aspect ratio resolution and
size for gaming in general the issues
are mostly nitpicks when it comes to a
gaming class display revolving around
calibration and how the wide gamut is
handled non-existent hgr performance is
also disappointing but considering this
display performs well for SDR content I
think it's easy to overlook this or a
problem if the pricing is acceptable and
as we move into discussing on pricing
this is where it becomes hard to
recommend the LG 34 GK 950 F at twelve
hundred US dollars it's by far the most
expensive ultra wide of this class on
the market and really the only feature
here that justifies this price tag is
the high 144 Hertz refresh rate
I think LG was also banking on HDR to
justify that price tag but they didn't
deliver in that regard so the refresh
rate is really all we're left with when
looking at other options we have
displays like the Alienware aw 3418 DW
for under $900 which is g-sync and 120
Hertz also with an IPS panel for NVIDIA
GPU owners that's a really great Buy and
I don't think the difference between 120
and 144 Hertz is all that significant
and then you've got some really
affordable 100 Hertz ba options like the
astute MX 34 VQ and vo-tech GM 34 c4n
that's six hundred and fifty dollar mark
which don't have as good a panel as this
IPS in my opinion but are significantly
cheaper there's no doubting this new LG
monitor has the best hardware but I
think that for $300 less you can get a
pretty similar experience from the
Alienware
option and then really if you are just
after the best value it's hard to go
past the VA options for almost half the
price if the 34 GK 950 F delivered a
proper HDR experience the price tag
would be justified but it doesn't so
what we're left with is a really great
SDR panel that's priced out of
contention I would have no hesitation
recommending this monitor if you could
find it on sale or at a great price say
800 or 900 dollars but right now this is
a prime example of there being no bad
products just bad prices that's it for
