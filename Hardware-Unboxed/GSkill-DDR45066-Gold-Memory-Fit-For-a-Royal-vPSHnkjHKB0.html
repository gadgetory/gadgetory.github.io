sponsoring our Computex 2018 coverage
check out Corsairs fancy new Vengeance
RGB memory and don't forget to arm
yourself with the game-changing
performance that only msi geforce gtx
ten series graphics cards can deliver
give yourself the competitive edge
you're looking for even in the most
challenging titles fast powerful and
made to game visit the link in the
description now to learn more welcome
back to hardware own box we're here at
the G skill booth we're checking out
their new Trident 0 l-r gb memory so
we'll go take a look at that in just a
moment and of course they have a range
of really cool looking custom systems
here they were also going to be taking a
look at so let's get straight to it
so this is G skills new Trident z royal
RGB memory and I reckon it looks
freaking awesome I'm definitely going to
be after some of this memory for my next
system build I believe will be available
later in the year so you might have to
wait just a little bit to get your hands
on this stuff but I reckon it looks just
bloody awesome cheese skills Trident 0lr
gb memory will come in the same
configurations as G skills current
top-end Trident Zr GB memory so you can
expect speeds across the entire range
from ddr4 2400 CL 15 all the way to ddr4
40 to 66 CL 17 we don't have exact
pricing for the Royal RGB memory just
yet thanks to the fluctuation in the
memory market however we do know it will
cost more than g.skill standard RGB
memory currently you can get a 16 gig
ddr4 3000 kit of trident z RGB for
around 200 us so if the royal RGB lion
was released today it would come in
above that price but again we'll have to
wait until later this year to get our
hands on this memory when you take a
close look at the Royal RGB line the
crystalline diffuser along the top edge
of the heat spreader produces a really
stunning effect for those builds where
you don't want the standard flat and
even diffuser on G skills existing RGB
memory this new Royal RGB design could
provide that extra bit of bling you're
looking for and of course we can't
forget the reflective chrome light
panels that run down either side of
these ddr4 sticks you'll be able to get
this memory with either gold or silver
heat spreaders and both look pretty
amazing I think the silver option might
work best with most bills
but the gold road is pretty unique
g.skill didn't just have tried n'zeer
oil RGB ddr4 memory on show the company
also launched a new series of ares x
low-profile ddr4 g.skill used to sell
Ares ddr3 memory as a low-profile option
for space constrained builds but this
new launch of Ares X updates their
low-profile options to ddr4
unfortunately don't really have any more
details than that also at the g.skill
booth we looked at a range of super
impressive modern builds all running
superfast g.skill memory the fastest
system used G skills try and see our GB
running at a huge 50 66 megahertz with
CL 21 timings and according to G skill
this was the fastest memory on show at
Computex 2018 the build itself was
fairly straightforward using a core i7
8700 K and an MS I said 370 I game
incarnating motherboard but clearly the
superfast stridency RGB memory was the
star of the show hopefully some of that
royal RGB memory will be able to hit
those sorts of speeds in the future
another system was seen using trident z
RGB memory this time hitting ddr4 4800
speeds at super tight CL 1717 1737
timings thanks to Samsung's BDI sees a
couple of other systems showcased 32 gig
of ddr4 4600 Co 18 with the core i7 80
600 K and the fastest so-dimm kit
possible quad channel ddr4 4200 CL 18
running on an asrock X 299 ITX AC
motherboard with a core I nine 79 40 X
this set of sodium ddr4 was part of
g.skill ripjaws line but wait there were
more custom systems on show at the
g.skill booth here we have a crazy
liquid cooled condenser mod where the
component sit in some sort of non
conductive liquid that boils evaporates
and then condenses back into cool liquid
when it hits the liquid cooled cold
top plate obviously not a practical sort
of system but these sorts of crazy
cooling solutions are some of the
highlights of Computex unfortunately I
have no idea what liquid they were using
here but it's safe to say it's a
non-conductive as the system does
actually work further along we saw an
awesome compact build built into an old
Mustang car radio complete with an
accessible DVD drive and Julie SSDs in
the front it's not the most crazy in
terms of liquid cooling or mods but I
really like the concept
and while not really g.skill specific
the Seuss ROG built in a Coolermaster
case with a full-blown LCD on the side
was really awesome too before we wrap up
this video I do want to mention G skills
new set of RGB mechanical keyboards the
full-size Ripjaws km6 70 and the 10
keyless km6 60 which are available in
white and black and either with raised
keys or insect keys depending on the
look you're after all of these designs
use cherry MX RGB key switches in
various responses and have nice features
like n key rollover anti-ghosting
onboard macro storage and a detachable
USB cable gschool also say they're
highly durable keyboards so that's
pretty nice so that's it for this year's
g.skill booth coverage don't forget to
check back on Hardware own box to the
rest of our Computex coverage definitely
subscribe and like this video
I'll catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
