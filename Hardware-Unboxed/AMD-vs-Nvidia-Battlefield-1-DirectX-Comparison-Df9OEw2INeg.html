days worth of testing for the latest
battlefield title the focus was mainly
on GPU performance so it stuck with my
core i7 6700 K test rig for the most
part the DirectX 11 results had the RX
480 and gtx 1060 performing pretty close
to one another though the GeForce
graphics card was a few frames faster
I only took a quick look at direct x12
performance because what I'd seen so far
wasn't that impressive and report some
others at the time seem to be in line
with my own findings the AMD graphics
cards delivered around the same
performance while the Nvidia cards were
a bit slower a few of you were quick to
point out that a few highly rated
outlets such as digital foundry found
the Rx for a dude to be quite a bit
faster when using DirectX 12 with micro
7 test rig overclocked to 4.5 gigahertz
this wasn't the case at 1440p I got the
same performance of 67 - 68 fps on
average since finishing my initial
testing and he also released the Crimson
16 point 10.2 driver which they
accidentally forgot to pass along to my
little channel anyway last night around
10 p.m. my MD contact was still away can
he pass the driver long what a champ I
immediately got testing and I'm about to
show you what I found for this video I'm
just gonna focus on the gtx 1060 and our
X 480 along with the core i7 6700k and
Core i5 6600 K since we won't be doing
huge amount of testing for this one I'll
just show you the gameplay footage which
is being captured using the external
alghero HD 60s let's get to it first up
we have the 6700 K test machine which is
clocked at four and a half gigahertz
with the tank stationary at the start of
our tests we see the 1060 is a few
frames faster than the 480 using DirectX
11 however using DirectX 12 the four 80s
around 5:00 or so frames faster than the
10 60 interestingly the 480 looks to be
delivering much the same performance
using DirectX 12 is the did DirectX 11
the difference being that the GTX 1060
is slobbed let's just watch this footage
to the end and then move on to the core
i5 results
here we have the same system with a
creek CPU swap now I'm to the core i5 66
I'm okay which I might add isn't
overclocked let's have a look at the
performance at the beginning of this
test it's interesting to note that the
performance is almost exactly the same
as what we saw with the 6700 K in my
initial benchmark I noted that when
briefly testing with the 6600 K it was
just a few frames slower than the
overclocked 6700 once again here we can
see that this is indeed the case again
we see that for the most part the RX for
this performance seems much the same
using DirectX 12 and DirectX 11
meanwhile the 10 60 is up to 10 FPS
slower using DirectX 12 here's a direct
comparison between the our X 480 running
DirectX 11 and DirectX 12 in our tests
really at no stage is there more than at
where PS difference sometimes DirectX 11
was faster and sometimes DirectX 12 was
which makes sense since I originally
found no real difference here
these results were recorded using a
heavily overclocked core i7 processor so
again let's check the core i5 6600 K
results even with the stock 6600 K the
results seemed to be much the same with
a few exceptions towards the end of the
benchmark where things really kick off
the rx 480 takes the serious performance
hit using DirectX 12 this contradicts
what some others have reported whereas
the RX 418 ever drops below 80 3 FPS
using DirectX 11 we see a drop down to
51 FPS very briefly using DirectX 12
while quite a bit of time was spent in
the 60s so I'm not quite sure what to
make it up moving on to the final
comparison I'd like to make let's see
how the gtx 1060 using DirectX 11
compares to the rx 480 using DirectX 12
initially the 10 CC can be seen 5 to 7
FPS ahead of the RX 4 80 throughout the
test the to do trade blows though for
the most part the 10 60 does stay ahead
at the end of the test when things get
busy the 10 60 never dip below 78 fps
whereas the our X 480 often drops down
into the 60s this is by no means bad
performance from the our X 480 but it
was at times 10 FPS slower despite using
directives 12
what a slow-moving target here driver
okay so I'm not sure if this has helped
clear anything up or just created more
questions I do stand behind my initial
DirectX 11 test and strongly believe
that to be a hundred percent accurate if
I didn't Adam in the video
I admit more DirectX 12 testing needs to
be done and I plan to tackle this more
in the future unfortunately for now this
is the best I could do with the time I
have available so as many of you know
I'm going in for my ACL surgery next
week and before then I've got to cover
the GTX 1050 and 1050 TI graphics cards
for you guys speaking of which have a
little something extra to show you in
this video I wonder what it could be
never seen such green boxes from MSI so
there you have it I've got the 1050 and
the 1050 Ti so it's gonna be a busy
weekend benchmarking on Tuesday you
should expect to see basically two board
partner card reviews so I'll be covering
probably six or seven of the latest
games so you can expect all the normal
information in those including your
power consumption and thermals and all
that sort of stuff as for the bigger
sort of 20 game benchmarks I think that
Steve's gonna be handling that one and
you can expect that a little later in
the week and most likely first up if
you're comparing this to the RX 462
gigabyte card so I hope the testing in
this video was useful for you guys I'll
see you guys for an episode of unboxing
boxes with ban on Monday have an awesome
weekend and I'll see you guys next time
cheers guys for joining me for another
episode of hardware unbox so those of
you that already support the channel
thank you so much it's truly appreciated
and to those of you that would like to
support the channel directly I do have
Amazon links and a patreon link in the
video description below thanks a lot and
I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
