going to discuss my experiences with
AMD's rise in the thread rip in nineteen
fifty X and the supporting X 399
platform are you guys often asked about
my PC in the monthly Q&amp;amp;A and seem very
interested and what I choose to use as
my daily driver and since I did
transition over to risin the third one
for 1950 X as I just mentioned while
almost a year ago now and we have
second-generation fedra purchased around
the corner I thought what better time
than to discuss my experiences so far
prior to the switchover to AMD ass which
I hadn't done for a very long time I've
been using Intel for the longest time
and yeah I was using the core i7 69 50x
Intel's 2016 flagship high-end desktop
CPU packing 10 calls at 20 threads and a
base frequency of just 3 gigahertz it
wasn't a particularly good overclocker
but still the 14 nanometer Broadwell ii
part came in at an MSRP of $1,700 u.s. a
somewhat absurd price but as well I
suppose it was the best of the best and
Intel was able to get away with charging
and I'm gonna link for it just to be
clear though I'm not saying there's no
desktop CPUs that aren't worthy of
commanding such an asking price the
problem with these 69 50 X was that it
costs 70 percent more than the 69
hundred K but only offered 25% more
cores so true extra cores were tacked on
and they bumped the price up by 70% so
that's why I say the $1700 u.s. MSRP was
absurd still for video editing and
encoding the 69 50 X was a beast so I
hung onto it for quite some time in fact
a little over a year later the core i7
7900 X landed and that came in at a
slightly more reasonable $1000 US and
although clocked better than the 69 50x
it did use the slower mesh interconnect
and that meant that it wasn't really an
upgrade over the 69 50 X also a new at
the time that it was just a few short
months before aimed it would release a
16 called 32 thread thread Ripper CPU in
August and then
after that Intel would release their 18
quart 36 thread core I am 979 80 XE so
after testing the 1950 X in August I
waited a month gave the 79 80 X ie
thorough tests and decided that if I
were to invest my own money in either of
these products it would be without a
doubt the thread Ripper 1950 X so that's
what I did I got my hands on a retail
thread rip in 1950 X MSI's X 399 Gaming
Pro carbon a/c pretty sweet gaming
motherboard that one and 64 gigabytes of
g.skill trailing Z ddr4 3200 memory and
through it all together
at the time the 1950 X cost half as much
as the core I 979 ad XE and in many
workloads was only a fraction slower
that being the case in terms of value
the 1950 X was the clear winner in the
benchmarks its price to performance
absolutely destroyed the sky like
x-range making home plate not a mockery
of the core o 1979-80 XE and then it's
16 14 12 and 10 core variants that said
the thread ripper platform did have some
issues most new platforms 10 - so
nothing totally unexpected there and we
do see the same from Intel quite
regularly actually so anyway let's talk
about those teething problems as with
all first generalizing products thread
rippers biggest issue as memory
compatibility and it was an even bigger
issue on the tr4 socket than it was on
the mainstream am4 socket the reason I
say this is because most building a
high-end desktop system designed for
well I suppose workstation type usage
those kind of people will likely
populate all the DIMM slots with as much
memory as they possibly can and Rison
doesn't particularly like that
assuming you have compatible memory it
will of course work it just won't work
at the same frequency are populating
half the dims would as an example my msi
x3 99 motherboard packed 8 DIMM slots
and I decided to populate all of them
with 8 gigabyte ddr4 3200 modules and
that gave me a total system capacity of
64 gigabytes and yeah before you ask I
didn't need that much memory and quite a
few times premier when working on our 4k
60fps high bitrate content did use quite
a lot of the memory almost all of it in
fact
the problem was with all eight modules
installed the system was limited to a
maximum speed of ddr4 2666 and even then
at times I did run into a few cold boot
issues and most of the time the system
did boot up okay but yeah in the early
days it was a bit frustrating at times
MSI did continue to release BIOS updates
and along the way that seemed to get
ironed out and the problem went away so
yeah at least one teething issue there
was solved that said to this day I am
stuck at ddr4 2666 if I want to run with
all 64 gigabytes and memory and well
that might not sound like a big deal to
many of you but the system is noticeably
better with ddr4 3200 so that being the
case around three months ago now I just
bit the bull I decided to strip out 32
gigabytes of memory again that also
sounds quite crazy but the faster memory
speed really did improve the editing
performance in premiere the application
was just noticeably more responsive and
of course gaming was also a lot better
as well so that is certainly quite the
compromise but I felt it was worth
making encoding still takes around the
same amount of time for any of you
wondering the difference with half as
much memory the 32 gigabytes is things
are just a bit laggy err when premier is
doing its thing and coding something so
if I'm using Chrome or whatever it's
just not a silky smooth as it was with
64 gigabytes of course from time to time
I also game on my main rig I do have a
separate gaming system but I don't know
sometimes I'm just too lazy to get up
and move my body to it I don't know long
long days of work you just want to fire
up a game that's quick and easy and have
a few around and that's what I often
found myself doing and for the first 6
months let's say it was a little bit
sketchy some titles just didn't work
that well I decided to leave the memory
mode as rumah so that's uniform memory
access mode as this works better for
productivity workloads so that makes
sense on my editing rig it is possible
to switch over to a non-uniform memory
access mode or Numa for short but you do
have to reset the whole system to do
that
still as this was mostly a workstation
PC I didn't want to be messing around
with memory access modes having to reset
the PC every time I decided to casually
firepit came for a couple of rounds the
newses at some point unfortunately i
don't know exactly when so that's not
terribly helpful but I suppose it
doesn't really matter because now it is
a lot better but at some point gaming
performance just got a whole lot less
sketchy so games would just load up and
work as you would expect them to so I'm
not sure if it was one of the major
windows updates or just a boss update
from MSI I'm not sure what it was but I
stopped seeing a lot of the glitches and
issues I was seeing and well some of the
games I play a good example would be
Star Wars Battlefront 2 that one was
quite painful the game itself once I got
into the game played fine but just
loading the game up so executing it from
the desktop to load the menu that took
quite a few minutes whereas on the 87 or
okay system it was I know 30 seconds or
something whereas it was 3 or 4 minutes
something crazy like that so don't know
if many people encountered that maybe it
was just my read but that was one of the
bugs I ran into and at some point
without me doing anything no fresh
install nothing those issues went away
and I was experiencing it in a couple of
games but Star Wars was definitely the
worst one still as I've said not all
games had issues straight away a lot of
them played fine a battlefield one for
example that ran without any problems at
all ran really smooth and all that sort
of stuff as you'd expect on like a rise
in 7 processor today though I'm no
longer seeing any issues at all when
playing games on the 1950 X whether it's
a really basic game like fortnight or
something near more in depth like
battlefield 1 or Star Wars Battlefront 2
they all play perfectly fine so that's
something beyond the memory woes and the
early teething problems with some of the
games anyway it's been smooth sailing as
I just said no issues with games anymore
they all play silky smooth so no dramas
there and I just have to make the
compromise between a memory capacity or
high speed memory you can't have both so
it's a bit disappointing but yeah it's
the first generation Rison thing well
even the second generation rise in CPU
still suffer that that's not quite as
bad though as a side note though I
should also add that it's not like
Intel's x-29 platform it hasn't had its
fair share of teething issues either
just as the x9r platform before it did
so none of this is particularly unusual
or an AMD only problem let's say for
everything else though thread Ripper has
really delivered delivered in a big way
having 16 calls and 32 threads to play
with is it's just amazing and really
something that we could have only dreamt
of a prior to its release as I said
earlier in 2016 10 cause was the
pinnacle for desktop CPUs anyway and it
cost you a suite $1,700 us and then in
2017 and the face of competition Intel
released a pretty underwhelming ten core
CPU for $1,000 us so would be by the end
of 2017 though AMD was selling the 1950
x4 less than $1,000 u.s. and today it
can be found on Amazon for seven hundred
and seventy five dollars u.s.
while the 7900 X still costs $1,000 u.s.
so AMD's undercutting Intel quite
heavily there anyway I've spent almost
one year with thread Ripper and I don't
regret the decision to go over to it
from the why suppose I would have gone
to the core I know in 79 AD XE if I
didn't jump over a thread Ripper so yeah
I don't regret that one bit and the semi
980 XE is plenty powerful but it just
doesn't make sense in terms of price
versus performance and I like to use the
kind of hardware that I would recommend
you guys use and the stuff that I
imagine most of you would use that I
don't think too many people would spend
twice as much money on the 79 80 X II
and on that note if Intel don't come out
with something a far more compelling
what they're currently offering I can't
see myself jumping back to the blue team
anytime soon in fact I'm almost certain
I will be doubling down and upgrading to
the thread Ripper 2990 WX on MSI's X 399
Croatian motherboard I can't wait to do
that build on the channel it's gonna be
a lot of fun I just jumping back to the
previous generation for a second and
just sort of summarizing what I just
said had it Intel been far more
aggressive with pricing it may have been
a tough call this one but for half the
price the 1950 X really was the obvious
choice over the 79 80 XE and today it
should be crystal clear even for the
most blue eyed fans what also should be
clear at this point is that next week
things are going to get seriously messy
for Intel as Amity pushes out their
second-generation thread Ripper series
we learnt at Computex that AMD would be
releasing a 32 core 64 thread thread
recipe on the tr4 socket and we just
learnt that it's going to cost
less than Intel's 18 course 79 80 XE
coming in an MSRP of $1,800 us so
assuming everything goes smoothly with
this release and we can probably expect
it to really given how well
second-generation Rison was received
it's very likely my workstation is going
to see a doubling of cause in the very
near future and fingers crossed improved
memory support and that is going to do
it for this one if you did enjoy the
