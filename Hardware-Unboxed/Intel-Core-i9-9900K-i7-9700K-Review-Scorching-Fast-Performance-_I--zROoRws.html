finally show you how the new 8 quart
ninth gen processors perform there's a
lot to go over in this video so I won't
waste too much time going over the specs
and all that plus they've been up for
pre-order now for about 10 days so none
of that stuff really is a mystery at
this point on hand for testing I have
the core I 999 - okay I actually ended
up with a few of those processors so I
will be out of hand one of them off to
Tim and then he can do some additional
testing perhaps look at things like
streaming performance because I know the
few of you guys that are interested in
those kind of benchmarks and then we
also have the 9700 K which is basically
the same CPU but crucially with
hyper-threading disabled so the core oh
nine ninety nine hundred K is an eight
core processor with hyper-threading
enabled for 16 threads and operate to
the base frequency of 3 point 6
gigahertz but will boost as high as four
point seven G coats on all caused with a
maximum single core frequency of 5
gigahertz the l3 cache has been
increased from the 87 k's 12 mega byte
capacity up to 16 megabytes and quite
shockingly despite packing two extra
cores and 4 megabytes more cache the TDP
rating remains at 95 watts which was
already suspiciously low 487 or okay and
we will explore the impact of this a
little bit later on in the video as I
said the 97 K is also an 8 core
processor but it lacks hyper-threading
support meaning it packs just 8 threads
it comes clocked at the same 3.6 Q have
base frequency while the alcorn single
core clock speeds have been devalued by
100 megahertz and the l3 cache capacity
dropped down to 12 mega bytes for
testing I'm using the MSI z3 90 godlike
but I've also confirmed the results with
as rocks as in 390 Taichi ultimate both
boards were tested using ddr4 3200 sale
14 memory and the same memory was used
on all platforms without any manually
tuned timings the graphics card of
choice is gigabytes RTX 20 atti gaming
OC and we have loads of results to go
over so let's get started first up we
have the memory bandwidth results and
unsurprisingly the new coffee-like
refresh cpus are on par with previous
models such as the core i7 87 okay so
everything is as expected here let's
check out some Cinebench results as
expected the 9900 K and 97 or okay
provide the highest out-of-the-box
single-thread scores
that we've seen to date easily breaking
the 200-point barrier thanks to the five
hero and 4.9 gigahertz clock speeds when
using just a single core with all cores
active the 99er okay breaks the 2000
point barrier making it 14 percent
faster than the risin 720 700 X
meanwhile the 9700 K managed to score of
just over 1500 points and that placed it
just behind the old 1800 X and just
ahead of the 87 okay that also meant it
was 26% slower than the 9900 a given
what we saw in Cinebench it's no
surprise that the no hurricane
outclassed the 2700 X in blender
reducing the workload completion time by
a rather large 23% that said the eight
core rise in CPU was a fraction faster
than the 9700 K moving on to Corona and
here we find a similar story the 99
hurricane reduced the render time by 20%
from the 2700 X taking just 96 seconds
that said though I should just point out
if you're mostly rendering then
something like the thread Ripper 2950 X
makes more sense and I will talk about
this a bit more later on in the video
the last rendering application that we
tested with is VRA and here the 1900
Kaine reduced the render time by 18%
taking just 62 seconds opposed to 76
seconds for the 2700 X the 9700 K was a
lot less impressive taking a few seconds
longer than the 8700 K making it slower
than both the 1,800 X and 2,700 X the PC
marked in synthetic gaming benchmarks is
happily on both the core clock speed and
the core count
that said it's interesting to see the 19
her okay only matching the 2700 X here
while the 97 or ek was only just able to
edge ahead of the older 1800 X when it
comes to file compression performance
the 99er okay is roughly on par with the
78 20x while the 9700 K fell just short
of the 87 okay which meant it was also
slower than the 2700 X decompression
performance is significantly stronger on
the AMD CPUs and here even the horizon 7
1800 X is able to edge ahead of the 99er
okay the 9700 K was able to slot back in
ahead of the 87 okay making it just a
fraction faster than the 2600 X moving
on to our excel testing here we see a
rapid completion time of just 1.8
seconds for the noisy Rek
reducing the completion time by third
two percent when compared to the 97 or
okay and 19% compared to the 2700 X so a
solid result for the 9900 cave the 9700
K though was much less impressive only
slotting in between the 87 RK and risin
520 600 X the core i7 87 okay already
had the rise in seven 2700 beat in hand
break so the new 8 core models take that
a step further even the 97 RK was seen
to be faster than the 87 okay here when
compared to the 2700 X the 99 K was 32%
faster though it was 20% slower than the
2950 X for those of you like me who use
Premiere Pro CC a lot or any other video
software on a daily basis these numbers
will be of great interest here the
encoding performance of the 99 or okay
is roughly on par with the 78 20x
meaning it was 8% faster than the 2700 X
and 17 percent faster than the 97 Rek
that said it was almost 20% slower than
the 2950 X so if time really is money
that's still a better option
editing performance with our warp
stabiliser test sees the 1900 can Li
just edged ahead of the 8700 K and 9700
K this meant while it was a bit faster
than the rise in 720 700 X it was quite
a bit slower than the 2950 X okay so
time to check out total system
consumption as expected the new 8 core
models are serious power pigs the 9700 K
matched the 78 20x for the total system
drive 235 watts when running our
handbrake workload the 9900 K pushed
total system consumption 9% higher
hitting 255 watts which is 13% more
power than the 16 core thread Ripper
2950 X system consumed we find a similar
story when testing with blender though
the AMD CPUs did perform better in this
application as a result the 2950 X was
able to work a bit harder but even so it
still consumed a less power than the
1900 a lesson of power consumption data
for the moment let's check out some
overclocking performance right so
overclocking these eight core parts to
5.1 gigahertz wasn't easy
it required 1.37 5 volts and a massive
liquid cooler you aren't hitting this
frequency with a 240 millimeter
closed-loop cooler
life Geerts is probably off the table as
well and we will look at thermal
performance in a moment looking at the
Cinebench r15 multi-threaded results the
no no okay saw an eight percent
performance boost while the ninety seven
okay
saw a seven percent boost I should also
note that I have two 1900 K samples and
both struggled with the 5.1 gigahertz
overclock they could boot into windows
at five point two gigahertz and run a
few basic tests but anything more would
result in the blue screen of death even
at one point four five volts moving on
to Corona the nine hundred K was seven
percent faster once overclocked well the
ninety seven okay enjoyed a nine percent
performance bump finally we have the
premiere results and again the 9700 case
or a nine percent performance boost and
the 1900 an eight percent boost so only
single digit gains making it hard to
justify the increase in power
consumption and operating temperatures
speaking of power the 9700 K
configuration consumed fifteen percent
more power once overclocked and the
ninety nine hundred K system an
additional 19 percent taking the total
system consumption to 294 watts now when
it came to operating temperatures I have
nothing but bad news these eight core
CPUs might have a stim pack
I mean soldered thermal interface but
you wouldn't necessarily know it stock
out of the box with either a premium air
cooler or a decent closed-loop liquid
cooler you're looking at low
temperatures well into the 80s and
overclocking is basically out of the
question
sure five units might be okay for games
but if you're placing all that cause
under prolonged stress temperatures will
hit 100 degrees and I was testing in a
relatively cool room inside a well
ventilated case using a custom liquid
cooling setup only reduced the stock
operating temperature by eight degrees
and we're talking about a 400 to 500
dollar u.s. kit here it was possible to
run up to five point one gigahertz but
even then temperatures were still
knocking on the door of 100 degrees
which is obviously quite insane so the
99 hundred K might be fast but good luck
keeping it at a reasonable temperature I
ran out of time to test the thermal
performance of the 9700 K but I will
include that data in a future content
peace for now let's move on to games
again due to time and how much we were
had to cover in this single video we're
only going to show the gaming
performance of half a dozen titles
starting with Assassin's Creed Odyssey
here we see the 1900 K boosting frame
time performance by just 4% at 1080p
when compared to the 87 or okay
while the 97 arcade was slightly better
providing a 7% increase
sometimes we see CPUs performing better
with SMT disabled if they have more than
enough cause the horizon process is
certainly get mugged at 1080p while
looking at the average frame rate here
the 9900 K was 23% faster that was just
10% faster 41% low result again we are
using an RT X xx atti
and we see when moving to the more
appropriate or realistic 1440p
resolution that the margins start to
really shrink here we see that the new 8
core models offer basically no
performance advantage over the 87 RK
that said the performance advantage over
Verizon was still reasonably significant
and it's not until we hit the 4k
resolution of the margin is almost
entirely eliminated still this isn't a
good title for Eisen so let's move on to
Star Wars Battlefront 2 here we see much
more respectable performance from the
Rison processes and even at 1080p the
intel core i7 + i9 processors don't
offer a noticeable performance gains
over the 2700 X the 9900 K was just 5
percent faster than nearly 700 K while
the 97 or Kate was 7 percent faster then
at 1440p we see no real difference
between the Intel processors and now
Rison is less than 10% slower finally at
the 4k resolution we see the playing
field neutralized and now all 5 chest to
the CPUs enable the same 76 FPS on
average next up we have Forza horizon 4
which isn't a particularly CPU demanding
title so unsurprisingly all CPUs enabled
a similar level of performance this is a
good example of how most games will
behave as most games are indeed GPU
bound like Assassin's Creed Odyssey
hitman is a tunnel that plays a little
oddly with horizon and this gave the
Intel CPUs a serious performance
advantage particularly at 1080p and
1440p the 1900 was also up to 12% fast
and the 87 are ok which can be seen when
comparing the 1% low results at 1080p
Rainbow six siege shows a little to no
performance gains for the 8 core 9th gen
process
over there December okay even at 1080p
meanwhile the Intel processors did offer
a performance boost over the horizon 720
700 X even at 1440p though the gains
aren't exactly noticeable the last game
we're going to look at the shadow of the
Tomb Raider and here the 2700 X gets
trounced at 1080p limiting the RT X xx
atti to around 90 FPS on average while
the Intel CPUs pushed on hit around 120
fps that said for the most part the 99
Hurricane 9700 offered no real
performance advantage over the 80s 700 K
the 9900 K did allow for a 10% boost to
the 1% low result at 1080p but other
than that not much to report here
I also took a bit of time to test gaming
performance with the NOAA hurricane 97
Erica overclocked a 5.1 gigahertz
interesting that we see no performance
game when testing with Assassin's Creed
Odyssey even at 1080p we found in the
past that overclocked and a decent Roque
led to almost no performance gains or at
least very small performance gains at
1080p with the 1080i and the same
appears true with the RT X 20 atti again
we see this time when testing with Star
Wars Battlefront 2 that there's really
no performance advantage to overclocking
these CPUs a mere 3% performance boost
to sing with the 900k and even less for
the 90s 700 K that said hitman is a
title that did see double-digit
performance gains from their overclock
here the 9th gen8 core processors were
up to 12% faster at IEP and 1440p once
overclocked ok so I've got two
photographs I'd like to discuss which
compared the performance of Intel's new
99 K on a flagship is m390 motherboard
to that of a budget 370 motherboard
MSI's said 370 PC pro packing a real for
phase vrm and for reference I've
included the core i7 87 okay and three
Ripper 29 50 X results so starting with
these stock out-of-the-box performance
we saw that the MSI z3 90 god-like
allowed the 900k to produce a score of
2048 points now slotting that CPU onto
the z3 70 PC Pro resulted in a score of
just 17 hundred and ninety points after
a six run average initially the score
started up around nineteen hundred
points but on the second pass we saw a
lot more Vera Moda lling and this
continued as we ran the test for
more times to report an average of six
runs this met on average the non-owner
Kate was 13% slower on the budget 370
board it is possible to enter the BIOS
and remove the power limits and this did
see full performance restored but even
then we still saw some vera modeling
going on and I did have a 120 millimeter
fan directly over the vehicle verum
heatsink so this is likely shortening
your life of the mother but I don't
recommend removing limits on boards with
them in place interestingly if you
overclock the 9rk on these at 370 but
with the limits in place the performance
is much worse than if we did nothing at
all basically the increase v core
voltage sees their verum throttle even
harder with the limits in place and
these further reduces the CPU core clock
speeds again removing the power limits
does mostly restore performance to what
we're seeing on the zeb 390 board but if
you're placing this board under heavy
load for extended periods of time on a
regular basis I don't imagine it will
have a long and happy life likely expect
fireworks in the short term wrapping
things up let's take a quick look at a
few application price vs. performance
charts for this I'm using the current
market price with the exception of the
core i7 78 20x here I'm just using the
MSRP as the current market price is
inflated by about $300 it's not worth
buying one at the MSRP as it is so let's
just go with that as a best-case
scenario quite clearly if you want to
get some rendering work done on a
serious budget there's no bidding the
risin 520 600 right now it's really not
that much slower than the core i7 700 X
and it's a heck of a lot cheaper but
let's focus on the new CPUs the 99 3k
and 9700 K the 9700 K is better than the
8700 K in terms of value but still much
worse than the cheaper Rison 727 or X
meanwhile the 1900 case smokes the 2700
X in terms of forwards but at almost
twice the price its poor value in
comparison if time really is money than
the much more expensive 29 50 X seems
like the obvious choice here also please
note these price versus performance
charts don't factor in motherboard and
cooling costs I will discuss those
shortly the Intel CPUs stack up much
better in a handbrake and do offer more
bang for your buck when compared to the
competing AMD CPUs that said this really
is a worst case scenario from Rison at
least in our battery of benchmarks as
previously the Rison 720 700 X really is
the ultimate value option for budding
content creators and the new 8 core
Intel CPU simply can't hold a candle to
it in terms of value the 99er okay
doesn't offer anything new heat when
compared to the 78 20x while the 97 RK
was no better than the e7 or okay so a
disappointing set of results here for
Intel in Adobe Premiere right so we've
just seen a boatload of graphs it's now
time to try and make sense of it all
these new 8 core coffee-like processors
certainly are interesting animals and
I'm not entirely sure who they're for
but before I try and work there I
probably should just touch on pricing
quickly since I haven't actually
mentioned that in this video yet so the
core I nine nine are okay that comes at
an MSRP a $500 US but as we've just seen
it currently costs more like five
hundred and eighty dollars us and then
we have the 97 okay and that's meant to
sell for well in thousand la quantities
three hundred and seventy four dollars
us it should be around that price and
we're currently seeing it a fair bit
over that at 420 US of course the core
i7 8700 K is also a little over the MSRP
right now priced at $399 us that it was
selling for a few months ago before the
supply shortages and all that stuff
kicked in anyway we've now established
that the new eight core parts aren't
cheap but who are they designed for
exactly well I know a lot of you guys
are gamers and Intel has been touting
the 9 100 K as the world's best gaming
CPU which I suppose technically it is
but at 1080p with an RT X xx atti
it's barely any better than the 87 okay
previously the world's best gaming CPU
and arguably still the best in terms of
value though we're talking about extreme
high refresh rate gaming value their
$150 u.s. the horizon 520 600 is now
without question the best value gaming
CPU overall that's just a ridiculously
good buy at that price in my opinion the
minor performance gains the 9700 K and
9000 k offer in some games using
unrealistic settings doesn't make them
better gaming CPUs than the 87 okay at
least right now the added power
consumption and heat makes
and less attractive options in my
opinion they really are getting too hot
to handle for almost a 50% increase in
price you're looking at maybe a 5%
increase in performance assuming you
don't game at 4k so while certainly very
fast gaming CPUs I feel like neither the
97 okay or 9 are okay make that much
sense for those looking to game
exclusively they might be useful as
streaming processors we haven't actually
looked at that yet as not enough if you
actually care about streaming benchmarks
for that to be part of our day 1
coverage but Tim will follow up with
that testing soon then if we look at
application performance it's still hard
to justify buying either of these 8 core
processors for the most part the 9700 K
is slower than the 2,700 X while the 9
RK is up to 30% faster so that is pretty
impressive
at least when overlooking the fact that
it costs 90% more not factoring in the
cost of the additional cooling another
subject that's a real issue for this CPU
there's simply no way you're going to
avoid thermal throttling without
spending around $100 u.s. on the cooler
at least without your PC you sounding
like a jet about to take off
throw in the course at H 100 I Pro and
the 1900 K now cost $700 u.s. and you
still can't really overclock it at least
without running it dangerously high
temperatures later this month the thread
Ripper 29 20 X will be landing for $650
u.s. and that means you can land at this
upcoming 12 core processor with cooler
for the same price as the 9rk with a
cooler and I'll leave it up to you guys
to work out which one's probably going
to be faster for productivity workloads
granted x3 900 motherboards do cost
about $100 more but you get twice as
many DIMM slots way more PCIe lanes and
well a serious workstation platform
there for purely for productivity than I
are okay it really makes no sense in our
opinion in fact the only scenario where
it might make sense is for someone who's
after an extreme high refresh rate
gaming system that also does a lot of
cool heavy productivity work so I guess
it's basically the perfect CPU for a
YouTube gamer for someone who doesn't
want to run to different systems like I
do the 900k might make sense for work I
have a thread Ripper 2950 X workstation
and for play I have a core i7 8
Center okay gaming rig it allows me to
enjoy the best of both worlds the 90 on
her okay is every bit as good as the 87
okay for gaming but not nearly as good
as the 29 50 X for most core heavy
productivity workloads so you can't
exactly say it's the best of both worlds
but if you lean more heavily to the
gaming side of things than I guess it is
a better choice obviously no matter your
preference only those with money to burn
will consider buying a 9r okay
at its current market price or even the
$500 u.s. MSRP for that matter for me
it's just too expensive and too
impractical keeping it cool seems like a
daily challenge and unless you're going
all out on custom cooling it's a
challenge you'll likely fail basically
you can build a rise in seven 2700
scamming rig with a gtx 1080i and still
save over $100 on the no no okay build
using a gtx 1070 so like I said unless
you have money to burn the known arcade
makes a little to no sense at the
current asking price the core i7 9700
okay well that's an even worse
proposition in my opinion and although I
haven't done all the thermal testing
that I would like to just yet and what I
noticed when testing sort of my initial
impressions of it is it does appear to
run a bit hotter than the a7 okay which
is quite shocking because it is a salted
ship so yes not sure what's going on
there but I will be probably looking
into that as you're watching this video
so there'll be some follow-up content
our looking into several performance a
bit more closely it also consumes a bit
more power than 87 or okay and for the
most part really only offered a minor
performance bump so I'd like in this
comparison to what we saw earlier in the
week with the RT X 2070 and GT X 1080 in
the sense that the newer product is
mostly faster by a very small margin but
it also costs a little bit more and as I
said unfortunately whereas the RT X 27
he used less power than the GTX 1080
we're not seeing that with the 9700 K it
isn't more fuel efficient than the 8700
K at this point I don't have too much
more to add or at least to much more
than I feel like I could add in this
video it's probably being quite long as
it is and we will have a week or twos
worth of content no doubt there's plenty
more testing and things to look at no
doubt you guys will have some ideas of
things that you would like us to look
into so yeah I will be doing that
for the next few weeks but yeah it's
been a busy week this week we had the
g4s RGX 2070 launched just a few days
ago and that was a really rushed review
yes so still recovering from that one
but anyway interesting look at the new
core and I know hurricane core i7 97
okay very very keen to hear your
thoughts on these new processes in the
comments section below so as always I
will be reading those and responding to
a good amount of them anyway that is
going to do it for this one if you did
