corner this week I can't say there's
been too much big groundbreaking news
but they are still a range of smaller
topics that I'll walk you through some
of which are pretty interesting so let's
get into them
the first topic for this week concerns
price drops for AMD's second gen rising
desktop processors this is a story that
did the rounds a few days ago but
probably exaggerated the situation in
most instances the basic new T is some
places found AMD's main for rise in CPUs
sitting well below there MSRP at
retailers like Newegg and Amazon horizon
520 600 was sitting at 165 dollars down
from $200 the rise in 520 600 XY 185
dollars down from 230 dollars
horizon seven twenty seven hundred $220
down from 300 bucks and the rise in
seven 2700 X was $290 down from 330
dollars now at face value this seems
like a price drop across the board
however this isn't a situation where
there has been an official price cut in
the last few days in fact three of these
CPUs have been at this price for months
now looking at PC part picker we can see
the horizon 520 600 has been around that
160 to 170 dollar mark since last year
with a brief period at the end of last
year dropping it down to 150 dollars the
2600 X has been dropping slowly but it
has been 185 dollars for about three
weeks now similar situation with the
rise in 720 700 X and it's $290 price
perhaps the biggest moved was the rise
in 720 700 coming down to just 220 dots
although it seems that deal was very
short-lived as today it's back up at
$240 which is $10 cheaper than the price
it has been out since February
however since February there have
actually been three times the CPU could
be found for $230 so when you put that
into perspective this latest price drop
just seems to be another flash sale
similar to those past deals and to be
honest as Steve said in his latest top 5
best CPUs video if you're after an 8
core rise in CPU the 160 dollar rise in
717
from the previous generation is a much
better buy it's $80 cheaper and only a
little slower which is hard to go past
something when it's priced like that so
yeah it would be nice if we could say
that AMD has cut the prices on their
rice and desktop CPUs in preparation for
3rd gen rise and later this year but so
far what we've actually been getting is
just a nice gradual reduction in the
price since the start of 2019 with a few
flash sales thrown into the mix where
we'll see official price cuts is much
closer to third gen rice since release
next up we have news surrounding the
ominously named Operation shadow hammer
a supply chain attack that used the asou
live update tool to install malicious
software on a su species for those that
haven't used the new sous PC before
their live update software is basically
the utility that allows you to download
driver and app updates for your system
similar to the u tourism other vendors
it's also preloaded on almost every
issue spacey operation shadow hammer
took place between June and November
2018 according to data from Kaspersky
Lab what happened is that the update
server hosting downloads for the live
update tool was compromised
the attack has uploaded a malicious
version of the live update tool to the
update servers which was signed using a
legitimate asou certificate the use of
this certificate made it hard to spot
that the live update tool was loaded
with a Trojan from their owners of a su
species downloaded the backdoor live
update tool presumably to update an
older version of this tool Kaspersky
noted that 57,000 users of their
software downloaded this backdoor
version which could indicate a massive
install base in the general population
once the malicious tool was installed it
went about targeting a specific group of
users identified by the MAC addresses of
their network adapters it's not quite
sure what's going on there seems pretty
spooky a soos was notified of the issue
On January 31 2019 so they've had some
time to deal with it but it isn't clear
from kaspersky report if they've fixed
the problem yet the use of a compromised
certificate is particularly worrying
you'd hope that invalidate that
immediately and then go about checking
and recertifying their software
pretty big news in the security world
and not good for a soos moving into some
game
News Now anthem has received an update
that introduces DLS s support anthem was
one of the game's on invidious
originalist that was supposed to get D
LSS and well now you can use it as
expected nvidia touting up to a 40%
performance improvement with DSS enabled
although for a quality loss like we've
shown in our video coverage so far like
with other dl SS games you can only use
the LSS at some resolution and GPU
combinations if your game at 4k d LSS
will be available on all our TX cards
but that 1440p you can only use the LSS
with the 20/80 2070 and 2060 so no 28 ET
i support a 1080p DSS is not available
at all we've had a few requests to look
into D LSS and anthem but it's really
not something I'm going to dive into I
feel I've covered most of the key
aspects of DSS in our videos on
battlefield 5 and Metro Exodus again we
still feel that resolution scaling is a
more versatile and often better solution
to gaining performance than the OSS and
it's available on old GPUs not just
interviews RTX cards at some resolutions
the other gaming story is that hitman 2
has received an update introducing a
direct x12 code path it was a little
unusual to see hitman to launch with
just dx11 support given that the
original hitman also @dx 12 but now both
games do support DX 12
we haven't tested performance ourselves
yet but we've heard varying reports on
the dx12 mode some people saying in CPU
limited scenarios their performance is
better using DX 12 other people have
seen slight improvements with AMD cards
and others haven't seen many
improvements at all there's the
possibility that like with hitman 1 DX 2
our performance will get better over
time in hitman two in other benchmarking
news Cinebench r20 is now available as a
standalone downloader from the max on
website when the tool originally
launched it was exclusive to the
Microsoft Store but this caused concern
among the benchmarking community is that
you know it could be updated any time
automatically which could make it hard
to maintain consistent numbers from the
same version of the app also using the
Microsoft Store sucks so in good news
it's now available to download as a
portable version moving into Steve's
least favorite section of news corner we
have some monitor news concerning the
asou SPRO @pq 22 you see
this is a pro out monitor it isn't
designed for gaming which tends to be
most of our monitor focus however this
particular unit is interesting because
it's one of the few OLED monitors on the
market this display was first shown off
at CES 2018 so a typical of suits
fashion it's taken over a year for this
thing to hit the market it's a 22 inch
4k OLED using a panel from Jay oullette
a joint venture between several
companies including Sony and Panasonic
22 inches is a bit small for most modern
displays but at 4k T does have a high
pixel density and the design is portable
with the ability to be folded up into a
neat package the key thing for content
creators though is the color and HDR
support because it's all red we have
purple local dimming peak brightness
isn't amazing at just three hundred and
thirty minutes but at least the local
dimming capabilities are the best it can
possibly be on top of that there's 99%
DCI p3 coverage a true 10 bit support
and factory calibration to a Delta II of
less than two this monitor won't be for
everyone though because it comes at a
massive price tag of 4700 British pounds
which puts its us price tag in the
$5,000 range now you can get a very good
OLED TV for 5000 bucks so a sous would
be hoping this monitor is offering
something that say a high-end 55 inch LG
OLED does not the portability and size
could be that but again it's a pretty
huge price to pay
galux has introduced an MDOT 2 SSD with
a massive heat spreader on it that
includes a heat pipe where does this
heat pipe go well just onto the surface
of the heat spreader for some bizarre
reason and look at the size of this
thing an SSD really does not require
this sort of cooling yet well galux has
done it anyway in terms of hardware it's
a fast drive with sequential speeds in
the 2.5 to 3.5 gigabytes per second
range and ran a performance of at least
400 K I ops which I guess increases with
each capacity jump and they will be
available in 512 gig one terabyte and
two terabyte capacities final topic for
this week Intel is reading a collection
of new 9th June desktop processors that
will pack a new stepping a seuss
gigabyte and asrock of all made
statements were waving to motherboard
BIOS updates for their 300 series boards
that will introduce support for CPUs
with new
Bing these chips are set to launch in
the second quarter of 2019 gigabyte in
particular says the stepping will be
labeled r0 as opposed to p0 for existing
nitrogen CPUs and use 0 for 8th gen
however is still unclear what the
differences these new chips will
actually provide whether it's fixing
errors or enabling new features until
isn't saying anything about this at this
stage we which I guess shouldn't come as
a surprise so we'll just have to wait
that's it for this week's news corner
