unboxed I know you guys that they were
very interested to see some more monitor
review coverage on this channel and I'm
delivering for you today with the AOC
Aegon AG 2 v 1 SZ another monitor with a
rubbish product and specs it really hard
to remember but this is a quality
monitor nonetheless now if you guys
watch my review of the asus rog PG 2 v 8
q a couple of weeks ago this is
essentially a freesync equivalent of
that monitor so it's still a twenty four
point five inch TN panel with a
resolution of 1920 by 1080 and it
supports that extremely high 240 hertz
refresh rate with adaptive sync so
despite the fact as a sloth on the
screen at the moment this monitor is no
slouch at all while many aspects of this
monitors specifications are very similar
to the PG 2 v + q like it's 1000 to 1
rated contrast ratio 1 millisecond
greater gray response times and it's 170
160 viewing angles this monitor is
cheaper than the PG 2 v 8 q by quite a
considerable margin because of the
difference between the three sync
modules that you find in a susur's
offering and free sync in the AG 2 v 1
after that boy that product name this
model is $300 cheaper in australia so it
comes in at $600 e 2 is right here and
for those of you in the United States
it's a little bit hard to get because it
hasn't quite hit the United States just
yet but we should see it coming in at
around 500 US dollars around $100
cheaper than it vpg 2 v 8 q and for a
monitor with very similar specifications
this could be quite a bargain for some
of you guys out there as always let's
start with the design and to be honest
this is a much more attractive monitor
than the PG 2 v AQ as you'll see the AG
2 v 1f said it has a much more
understated design there's lot of gaming
elements in the PG 2 v AQ but you won't
find this here on the AOC offering and i
think that makes it look a lot better on
your desk i love the wide silver stand
that
you'll find here it's made of metal it's
very sturdy and although it's large it
does provide a number of manoeuvrability
options I think most of you will be
after including height adjustment in my
opinion the most important adjustment
feature of any monitor there's also your
standard tilt and swivel adjustment so
you can turn this from portrait to
landscape mode and vice versa and it
also supports your pivoting options from
the base so you can rotate this monitor
without having to adjust the base itself
you simply plant the stand on once and
adjust to your heart's galore as the
standard supports height adjustment it
still uses a pillar design that takes up
a fair bit of space on the back so it's
not particularly slim monitor that says
the actual display section is a bit
slimmer than the PG 2 v 8 q and that
makes it look a little bit nicer you'll
find a large red strip along that back
panel which adds a little bit of you
know highlights to the design I guess
you'd have to say but again no massive
game of style elements like on the PG 2
5 X 2 and even though there's a large
red back here I think it looks quite
good in general and I appreciate the
design that a OC has used here as far as
connectivity is concerned there is a lot
of it on the AG 2 v 1s then you'll find
DisplayPort which is necessary for
achieving 240 Hertz and for free sync
there are also two HDMI ports one of
those supports mhm L you also get a DVI
port and even a Reggie a port for those
of you still using that legacy connector
there are two 3.5 mm audio jack
pass-through so you connect your audio
cables up to the back of the monitor and
you can plug in your headphones and
microphone to those convenient ports on
the right hand side also on the right
side two USB 3.0 ports with a further
two USB 3.0 ports on the rear of the
monitor from that USB 3.0 hub again
quite a handy range of connectivity here
on the front of this monitor you'll find
10 millimeter wide bevels on the left
and right hand side so slightly larger
than the PG 2 5 8 2 but slim nonetheless
and the on-screen display controls are
basically four buttons that you will
find along the bottom edge in the
right-hand corner it's pretty difficult
to control the OSD through these sort of
buttons and I prefer the toggle design
of the PG 2 5 8 Q but you do get quite a
range of features in the
screen display including a whole bunch
of gamer modes things like shadow bite
brightness boosting you've got some
saturation controls as overdrive is even
something that allows you to make a
certain area of the screen bright I'm
not quite sure why you need that feature
but it's all including the on screen
display here you don't get some of those
crosshair features like you're playing
the PG to 580 I think there's still
enough customizability available through
the on-screen controls on the AG to 5-1
at set and for those of you who are
fighting it too difficult to control the
monitor through those buttons on the
bottom power IOC is included this it's a
comically oversized dongle obviously the
text is designed for elderly people is
no other explanation for why this thing
is so massive but basically this brings
out some of the controls from the
monitor and puts it on this button so
it's a little bit easier to control and
navigate through the on-screen display
using this little dongle it plugs in
through a USB type B port which I can
find here that plugs into the back of
the monitor so you can simply plug it in
set up the monitor however you want
using this little dongle and then unplug
it and throw it away which is kind of a
neat feature to be honest considering
that those consequences play control can
be a little bit difficult to use up with
those buttons on the bottom and I kind
of appreciate it though I guess the
dongle is a little bit too big for my
liking
obviously the standout feature of the AG
251 FZ it is 240 Hertz maximum refresh
rate as I mentioned in my previous
monitor review I can definitely tell the
difference between 60 Hertz and 144
Hertz makes a massive difference in the
general usability of your PC and in the
responsiveness of games however when you
upgrade from 144 Hertz to 240 Hertz
there's diminishing returns for sure I
definitely can't tell as much of a
difference between those two refresh
rates but for those of you who are into
extremely responsive gaming your love
planning esports tiles or comparative
shooters or whatever you will benefit
from the reduced input latency and
increased responsiveness of your gaming
experience when playing at 240 Hertz and
that's obviously why a or C has decided
to produce a 240 Hertz more it's for
those guys out there who are
gamer's and love playing those sort of
eSports titles also is pretty
interesting to see 240 Hertz support in
a free sink motor obviously on the
Nvidia front was pretty easy to hit 240
FPS and some games using like a GTX 1080
or GTX 1080i and adjacent monitor like
the PG 2 5 8 Q but on the freesync front
it's pretty hard to hit 240 frames per
second using an iOS 480 or a fury X you
probably need to run our X 480 crossfire
sort of hit those upper frames limits
that you'll need for 240 Hertz or you
could simply wait for Vega that should
be coming in the next couple of months
so not the best moment to buy just at
the moment but I think AMD will have
some solid graphics offerings in the
next couple of months that will really
take make use of the children foyers
refresh rate you'll find in smaller
alright let's jump into spectra Cal Cal
Man 5 and take a look at how the AG 251
F said performs in our usual range of
color performance tests obviously this
is a TN panel so we're not expecting the
best viewing angles or contrast ratios
and that's definitely the case with this
monitor a contrast ratio of just 868 to
1 is below what you'll find on IPS
monitors and the viewing angles on this
panel are not too amazing particularly
in the vertical direction you can
achieve 411 nits of peak brightness when
you set the brightness level to 100 but
adds to fault level of 90 we achieved
336 nits of brightness together which is
a bit too bright for most indoor viewing
conditions at least in my opinion and
what you should definitely calibrate
your monitor too as you'll see here the
default color temperature average is 64
97k which is very decent and close to
the accurate value however the display
is cooler at those mid gray levels and
warmer and pure white and this is
reflected in a grayscale Delta a 2000
average value of 2.39 during a grayscale
sweeps there so not the most accurate
display in terms of grey performance and
gamma performances well pretty
disappointing at just a value of 2.0 by
default as we move on to our saturation
sweeps we find a delta 80 mm value of
2.1 for decent but not outstanding let's
remember
course that a delta e value of under one
is considered pretty much accurate and
anything after delta a of two to three
can be considered good but not fantastic
as we move on to our color checker
custom tests the AG 251 s then produced
an average delta e mm value of two point
nine one so again not fantastic but not
terrible for a monitor out of the box if
you want to calibrate this model now but
you don't have a color calibration tool
available to you you can make some
adjustments in the on-screen display I
recommend changing the contrast to 45
brightness to 49 leaving the gamma
setting at gamma one the other two
settings don't really impact the
accuracy too much setting the color
temperature to the user setting and
setting red to 51 green to 49 and blue
to 44 and just need to leave most of the
other settings at their default level
however I would recommend to them on
overdrive and switching it from off to
strong I think that gives the best
anti-ghosting performance after
performing these OSD adjustments you
will see pretty decent grass Gaillard
performance here the Delta II mm value
has improved to 1.69
gamma still remains pretty poor at 2.0
and the ccc average is decreased to 6 6
7 9 k however i do appreciate that
increased accuracy in the grayscale
sweeps looking at our saturation sweeps
and the average Delta II mm o has
improved a 2.01 so pretty decent is
certainly getting there and the color
checker results we're dancing an
improvement a delta e value of 2.73 so
you can make some minor improvements the
on-screen display adjustments but not
quite as good as you'll get from the PG
2 5 8 2 using the kalman 5 utilities to
calibrate this monitor using my eye 1
display Pro you can achieve very
accurate results on the hd25 1 FZ we're
seeing an average grayscale Delta e 2008
of 0.75 sets essentially accurate and an
average color temperature of 6 506 K
again very very accurate here probably
the weakest aspect of this display and
something that
we be calibrated out is the gamma value
still sits at two point one after
calibration I guess it's not too much of
a big deal but I would have ideal I have
seen that at two point two color
accuracy is also improved it's not dead
accurate within our saturation sweeps an
average Delta e value of one point five
three again an improvement over dis
calibrate using the OSD and again you
can see here in our color checker test
that the average delta 2000 very has
improved you above one point eight seven
so not as accurate as you'll find from
an IPS level professional-grade Mona but
with some calibration you can still
achieve really good results with the AG
two five one I said I think will be
suitable for most gamers and people
after just sort of your decent levels of
color accuracy and performance so the
AOC Aegon AG 251 F set is certainly a
very decent gaming monitor for those of
you who want something that's twenty
four point five inches and they can hit
a two hundred and forty Hertz refresh
rate it is only 1080p but you do get a
very responsive gaming experience from
that high refresh rate and support for
free sync will please both on AMD
systems the color performance out of the
box is decent though not outstanding and
it can be calibrated to a decent level
after the fact it's not as good as
you'll find from an IPS level display
but still decent nonetheless and the
main feature here at the AG two five one
and said that I really appreciate is
it's designed much better than the
competing a seuss rog PG 2 582 that i
reviewed previously i love it's much
more understated and professional design
that looks a bit better on your desk and
you get an increased range of ports
including two HDMI ports and even VGA if
you wanted to use it
the pricing that's another important
aspect of the hd25 one I've said that
makes it a more compelling option than
the PG two five eight two for those of
you on a budget obviously if you're on
an Nvidia system you'll still need to
spend a bit more to get that g-sync
module but for those that don't care or
on an Ambu system you'll be saving at
least a hundred US dollars compared to
the PG to 5aq
with this guy coming in and around five
hundred dollars when it hits the u.s.
officially and for those of you in
Australia this is a $600
ozzie monitor pretty expensive for a
1080p to twenty four point five inch
more I know but it is $300 cheaper than
the PG 2 v 8 q making one of the
options available for the specifications
that you get and that's where I think
the AOC Aegon AG - v 1f said really
succeeds anyway that's it for this
review of the monitor I hope you guys
enjoyed it don't forget to check the
written review on text but calm and
we'll catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
