looking at what really is a ridiculous
product the Philips momentum 43 which
also has a crazy product name you might
have seen which I'll put on the screen
now rather than trying to say it and
stuff it up every time
anyway the momentum 43 is a 43 inch 4k
HDR monitor it's not a TV according to
Philips but a monitor so apparently they
think some people interested in such a
massive display for their PC this thing
is pretty big it's been sitting in my
hallway for a while now so I figured
it's about time I get to reviewing it
and I'll talk a bit more about the site
later but first a couple of important
specs this 43 3840 by 2160 pound uses VA
technology with a quantum dot film and
it's sports display hgr 1000
certification plus you get adaptive sync
a cave routing through a rather narrow
48 to 60 Hertz range with a 48 Hertz
minimum we're not getting low framerate
compensation or LFC and as a result
we're also not getting the full benefit
of free sync it's also the reason why
the momentum 43 is not advertised as a
free sync to HDR panel it fails the
certification process for free sync too
as it doesn't support LFC this is
despite display boasting full display
hgl 1000 compliance the lack of free
sync to an LLC is a bit of a bummer
considering Ferb's is positioning this
display as more of an entertainment or
gaming focused unit you'll be fine
watching hgr movies are playing console
games but PC game is a a bit left behind
compared to the best 4k gaming displays
out there this monitor is better suited
to non PC usage for another reason as
well it uses a non-standard sub pixel
structure which causes a bit of text
blurriness in Windows it's definitely
not the clearest 4k display I've seen
and this doesn't have anything to do
with its size as the pixel density here
matches that of a 27-inch
1440p monitor the BGR instead of RGB sub
pixel array is a non-issue outside of
viewing text and documents in a PC
operating system though so gaming is
fine for example while Philips does say
this as a gaming or entertainment
display there are some odd design
choices they go against this marketing
push the battle only has a single HDMI
port so those with multiple console
perhaps a console in a 4k blu-ray player
can't plug in both at the same time
without a switch or adapter but then
there are two display ports one
full-size in one mini along with a USB
see input using DP alt mode these are
features you'd normally associate with
the PC monitor rather than an
entertainment focus display with a wide
2 prong stand the momentum 43 looks more
like a modern TV than a traditional
monitor the display is of average
thickness with average bezels nothing
amazing for a monitor of this size then
the use of basic plastic on the front
and rear keeps everything looking nice
and minimal in choosing the sort of
design the momentum could be used for a
number of applications without looking
out of place it could be a TV for
console gaming it could be a large
office monitor or it could just be a
monstrous PC gaming display along the
bottom edge you'll find Phillips and B
glow lighting which is basically just
two RGB LED strips and some processing
software they gets these strips to mimic
the average colors currently on the
display in a dark room with white walls
this provides pleasant ambient lighting
in some situations and it works quite
well it's both responsive and accurate
what's being shown in fact asada may be
it lighting it's worth experimenting
with and it's definitely more useful
than just a basic RGB strip of course it
can also be fully disabled and in fact
comes disabled by default if you want a
more traditional display experience as
the on-screen display Philips does
include a directional toggle on the
display itself for easy navigation but
even easier than that is the remote they
include the remote is very basic and is
mainly used for changing inputs and the
volume of the built-in speakers but it
can also be used to flick through the
on-screen settings and that certainly
helped for calibrating the display plus
if you end up using the momentum 43 as a
TV the remote is basically an essential
inclusion it shouldn't come as a
surprise though that the stand is very
limited in that it only provides tilt
adjustment I would have been amazed if
it included any other adjustments so if
you want to mount the screen higher up
or an angle you'll need to purchase a
200 by 200 visa mount which is
compatible with the display this size
and weight obviously one of the big draw
cards of the momentum 43 is its size and
this thing is certainly enormous for
gaming I use a 34 inch Acer predator X
30 for ultra wide which is already
pretty wide as it is but the momentum 43
is a good 10 centimetres wider
obviously being significantly taller as
it's a 16:9 panel for productivity use I
found the momentum to be impractical for
most tasks it does have a few things
going for it a pixel density equivalent
to a 27-inch 1440p display means you
don't have to mess around with display
scaling to read text at a typical desk
viewing distance it also gives you
plenty of screen real estate equivalent
to for 21.5 inch 1080p monitors in a 2x2
grid so you can snap apps to each corner
and view four windows at once while
still keeping things nice and visible
something you really can't do with a 32
inch 4k monitor or smaller but my main
problem with this monitor for
productivity tasks is that no work mode
ever feels comfortable to use if you're
just viewing one massive 4k window
that's a waste of screen real estate and
in many apps like Photoshop your eyes
will be dining around the screen to
taskbar on the left and right sides in a
split screen view because the panel is
flat the edges are far away from your
eyes and it's just not a great
experience compared to a standard dual
screen setup where you angle the screens
for optimal viewing of each one and then
with one window in each corner nothing
important is in the center of the screen
and the center is the most easily
viewable part where the size really
shines is for entertainment which is
exactly what Philips markets this
display for when you track a 43 inch
screen at arm's reach on a desk its
truly enormous occupying a massive
amount of your field of view compared to
a standard 21:9 ultra-wide monitor the
major advantages in its height the
momentum 43 just engulfed your vision
where an ultra wide doesn't really
provide the same level of vertical
immersion that said in a lot of games
you'll have to adjust the field of view
and the HUD positioning to ensure the
main action is still in the center of
the display I felt the best use of the
momentum 43 is a PC gaming display was
in games the delay to adjust these
things so that you're not just viewing a
blown-up image but instead of getting
you know more peripheral vision both
horizontally and vertically not every
game allows you to do that though or can
do so without a fisheye effect so it can
be a bit of a mixed bag when I
personally use a 43 inch display for
gaming
well probably not considering my
existing 21:9 space is actually useful
as a Productivity monitor and the
exercise of the 43 inch momentum doesn't
always lead to better results in games
but I can definitely see the appeal for
a mess
display like this for some games though
it's gonna be more of a nice thing aside
from the size the other key reason to
buy the momentum 43 is its HD our
capabilities in particular display HDR
1000 certification what we're getting
here on the spec sheet is actually
pretty good as far as monitors are
concerned we often see companies
slapping HDR onto their monitor boxes
with that tackling even one of the three
key HDR pillars but in this case Philips
has made an effort to provide an HDR
experience that exceeds SDR and that
shows with display HDR 1000
certification as you can see in the
checklist we get over 700 nits of
sustain brightness and 1000 nits peak so
Philips has smashed that target we also
see an increased color space of 145
percent srgb a 10 bit panel through FRC
and local dimming however the bigger
mission here is an F Ald or full array
local dimming backlight the momentum 43
only features edgelet dimming in 32
zones so unfortunately this panel
doesn't meet everything in my HDI
checklist and let's talk about the edge
lip dimming for a moment here 32 zones
is larger than what you see with
Samsung's basic HDR panels for example
but it's still nowhere near the level of
the 384 so an FA LD backlight you get
with a soos and Asus chasing hgr
monitors the big issue with edgelet
dimming is it can't show bright objects
in the center of the display without
producing a noticeable glow that extends
from the edges of the display to the
bright object va is excellent native
contrast helps mitigate this issue
somewhat compared to IPS displays but
the glow is still present and in a dark
viewing environment it's pretty
noticeable each loading zone also
appears a little slow to respond
compared to other HDR display as I've
used while I could slam Philips more for
using a dilute local dimming the reality
is this monitors HDR mode does provide
an improvement over SDR because it
comfortably provides two of the three
key HDR pillars in brightness and color
space and in a lot of situations the
edgelet backlight does help improve the
dynamic range and contrast or sense but
of course it does depend on what you're
viewing so it's not like the HDR
experience is awful because it lacks an
F alt backlight it's definitely better
than SDR but the experience isn't as
good as with a proper HDR display that
takes every box so I guess I'd have to
class the momentum 43 as an HDR light
display
something along those lines the good
news is that the areas of hgr that the
momentum 43 does support like brightness
and color space it supports really well
the panel can comfortably sustain over
900 minutes of brightness regardless of
the window size and while peak
brightness doesn't quite hit a thousand
it's the nine hundred and thirty five
minutes my unit can produce is
absolutely blinding at a desk viewing
distance when you're not experiencing
the glow issues from the edge of it
backlight we're also getting contrast
ratio over forty thousand to one in a
best-case scenario which is pretty great
and as for color space 97% DCI p3
coverage means the display can show a
significantly higher number of colors
than the basic srgb which leads to more
vibrant imagery in the HDR mode as we're
looking at a VA panel here I wasn't
expecting fantastic response times
Philips claims a formula second-grader
grade transition which is well below
what we typically see from VA panels in
practice so my immediate thought was
there probably fudging that number
however this particular 43 inch VA panel
is actually one of the best VA s for
response times I recorded an average
grade gray response of 6.5 3
milliseconds with relatively consistent
performance form rises and falls this is
well below the sixteen point seven
millisecond refresh window of the 60
Hertz panel and no single transition
comes even close to exceeding it we're
not quite in the ballpark of a good T
yet but this is definitely a very good
result for a VA with your sort of
performance the momentum 43 will be well
suited to running out 120 Hertz but
unfortunately we're cap to just 60 Hertz
I should also mention here that we're
using an off overdrive setting all the
other overdrive settings introduce
overshoot but the performance from the
off mode is actually still pretty good
so it's not a bad mode to use at all
input lag isn't as fantastic with the
momentum 43 using our standard test
conditions which includes the display in
a calibrated state running over
DisplayPort at a native resolution with
a low input lag mode enabled
I measured lag of approximately 34
milliseconds and you can add on another
10 to 15 milliseconds when switching the
low input lag mode off this is a very
poor input lag result making this
monitor all of the slowest we've tested
I did see some other reviews claiming
input lag that's much better than this
however I couldn't replicate those
results of any configuration of settings
I tried so not sure what's the case
there in terms of SDR brightness and
contrast the display tops out at around
560 nits and delivers a native contrast
ratio of around 4500 to one although you
can use the dynamic backlight in the SDR
moe to increase that contrast ratio
further SDR color performance out of the
box is disappointing for a number of
reasons its default state the display
delivers an uncalibrated color gamut so
standard srgb imagery is stretched out
to a wider gamut approximately a DCI p3
which leads to over saturation we're
looking at our saturation in color
checker charts this is quite evident and
is the cause of the high average Delta
ease default white balance is also a
little off the screen appears to have a
slight red tint when viewing whites and
while the average Delta II is reasonable
in grayscale there's a few issues with
the CCT and gamma curves Philips does
include an sRGB mode and this tightens
up the gamut to srgb which solves the
saturation issue however the issue with
the srgb mode is it doesn't allow you to
change the brightness level so if you
want any accurate colors you're stuck
with a very high 417 it's of brightness
which is quite frankly a ridiculous
restriction that makes the srgb mode
completely useless no one in a typical
usage environment is going to be running
this monitor at 417 nits if you could
change the brightness it would be a
great option for those that want knee
accuracy without a full calibration but
locking the brightness slider is just a
dumb oversight or choice on the part of
Philips if you want to get accurate
color performance out of the momentum 43
you have no choice but to perform a full
calibration using something like spectra
Cal's camera and five as there's no
other setting in the OSD that allows you
to restrict the display to srgb the SDR
usage the good news is the panel is
highly calibrated and every aspect of
its performance can be corrected to an
elite standard with that sacrificing
brightness or contrast ratio though as
you need to software profile to do so
not every app will pay attention to
these Corrections the final area of
performance I wanted to explore is
uniformity and it's perhaps the area I
was most disappointed in my Philip's
momentum 43 is not particularly uniform
and it's visible immediately when
viewing any solid colors there's an
obvious dark shadow around the edges of
the monitor which basically causes a
vignette effect this is really
disappointing for a high-end display or
this size you're getting entry-level
uniformity here and this is something
you really can't correct so the one
thing I haven't mentioned up until this
point is the price and that's largely
because this is a niche product those
looking to buy something like the
momentum 43 will be specifically after
what this display provides and really
there's not a lot of competition there
are a few other 43 inch 4k displays out
there but the momentum 43 is the only
one that is hgr capable and is certified
for display HDR 1000 anyway the momentum
43 is priced at nine hundred US dollars
or fourteen hundred ozzie which is
around 250 to 300 US dollars more than
your basic 43 inch 4k IPS SDR display
and there's typically retail for 600 to
650 u.s. the HDI provided by the
momentum 43 is far from perfect but it
still will deliver a much better
experience than those basic 43 inch
display so once a the higher price is
worth it in that sense that said I'd
really only recommend this monitor for
those who want to use it for HDR gaming
or movie playback the SDR mode has a few
issues like a wider than standard color
gamut that you can't easily correct and
the uniformity issue makes desktop use
with solid colors a bit of an eyesore
those who just want a massive display
for productivity for whatever reason are
going to be better off with the $600
basic IPS equivalent but the bigger
question is whether you should buy a 43
inch monitor like this at all as I
mentioned earlier in this video I think
this sort of size is impractical for
productivity use those that want to
multitask with side by side apps are
better off with either an ultra wide
display or multiple monitors so you can
position them to better suit your field
of view for PC gamers the momentum 43 is
massive but if you're using it at a
standard desk viewing distance you'll
most often find games are just enlarged
onto this huge screen rather than extend
it to give you a better field of view
for that reason I'd probably again
recommend either an ultra wide display
or say a 32 inch monitor which will
present you with fewer issues and then
for people wanting to use the momentum
43 more as a TV se for console gaming or
movie watching I don't think it provides
good value
sure it is a 4k HDR display and has a
remote but there are much better 4k HDR
TV deals out there I'd recommend the 55
inch vizio P series which is actually a
hundred dollars less than the momentum
43
fighting a larger screen an F Ald
backlight for better HDR and similar
brightness color space and contrast to
the momentum and it has five HDMI ports
not one so at the end of the day the
Philips for momentum 43 is kind of left
in no-man's land it's a fairly
respectable displayed its own right it
does a lot of things well and also has a
few issues but I just don't see a use
case for this class of display at this
price it's basically a super niche
product you'd only really consider it
seriously if you had a specific reason
to purchase a 43 inch monitor with
display HDR 1004 most people I don't
imagine they will have that specific
reason
luckily for Philips I have a 32 inch
version from their new momentum series
here in the office as well to test so
look out for that on the channel soon I
think it might be more useful to a wider
audience but we'll see because I haven't
actually unboxed it yet so I guess
