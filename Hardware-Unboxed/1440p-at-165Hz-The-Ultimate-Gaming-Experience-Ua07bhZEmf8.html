unbox so one of the questions that I
often get asked is what is the best
monitor you can buy at the moment for
gaming or what monitor delivers the
ultimate gaming experience of course
there are a lot of choices for monitors
out there at the moment and that makes
picking one variant as the best for
gaming a pretty tricky task for k5k and
even 8k display through the top of the
resolution charts at the moment but
every day PC gamers would struggle to
hit 60fps at these resolutions we know
how important getting 60fps is for PC
enthusiasts ultra-wide pounds or
personal favorite of mine I love gaming
on my 13 44 by 14 48 0 2 X 34 but the
increased resolution over 1440p the high
price of these models and the additional
width doesn't necessarily make it the
right choice to everyone however there
is one type of monitor though that ticks
nearly every box for high quality PC
gaming when it provides a good mix of
resolution and high refresh rate while
still being realistically usable on
today's most popular gaming hardware and
of course talking about the latest
27-inch 1440p IPS monitors that hit a
whopping 165 Hertz with support for
adaptive sync these monitors hit the
mark in many respects and today we're
going to explore what sort of gaming
experience you can expect with such a
feature Laden display but first let's
quickly talk about display Hardware
there are a number of 27-inch 1440p 165
Hertz monitors on the market most of
them are pretty expensive but most use
the same AU Optronics a hva panel with a
hva being the company's proprietary IPS
technology it's a pretty confusing name
actually has nothing to do with vertical
alignment VA technology so it's pretty
much the same as some of the IPS panels
that you've seen before the panel has a
1000 to 1 contrast ratio for millisecond
response times 315 it's of peak
brightness and from my experience with
one fantastic viewing angles and color
performance they can be calibrated to me
srgb standards
I happen to have one of these pounds in
for testing inside the viewsonic XG two
seven zero three - GS thankfully you
won't have to hear me say that product
name too often it's a bit of a mouthful
like most monitors but yeah it's one of
the cheaper options that use via HIV
opener I was talking about before when I
say cheap though I do mean seven hundred
US dollars so it definitely sits towards
the top of monitor pricing before you
jump into the comments in protests
saying that's not a cheap monitor
because I agree with you it's not hugely
cheap up against other 1440p options but
it's worth noting that a top-end 34 inch
IPS ultra wide will set you back at
least twelve hundred dollars while a 4k
IPS panel with g-sync is no less than
eight hundred and eighty dollars and for
those of you who interest in the new HDR
displays coming in the future and yes I
hope to take a look at some of those
soon expect them to be even more
expensive and the good thing I guess is
that most people buying an Amana
probably won't think of upgrading again
for many years so if you're after the
ultimate monitor experience I guess $700
well it isn't too much to pay if you're
going to be using it throughout the next
couple of years so you're probably
wondering why I'd recommend a 1440p high
refresh monitor over something lower
resolution or cheaper now it stems from
two aspects current PC hardware and the
longevity of moderns which is something
I touched on a little bit before when
you look at the most popular graphics
cards in systems being built today the
nvidia geforce gtx 1060 and the gtx 1070
are right at the top of the charts the
gtx 1060 is a great card for 1080p
gaming but those people interested in
going above that resolution are looking
at the gtx 1070 as a baseline plus I
figure that most people looking to drop
700 US dollars on a monitor are probably
going to have at least a gtx 1070 in
their gaming rig anyway or at least
that's what I'd recommend before going
and dropping that much cash with the gtx
1070 chosen as our baseline GPU platform
let's take a look at how performs at
1440p of course you can go back and look
at our previous coverage of GPUs at
1440p
but here's a summary of what to expect
note that for the following tests I did
actually use a system with the geforce
gtx 980ti in it along with the horizon 7
1,700 X processor Steve decided that he
needed all of our gtx 1070 s for use in
another project so I was stuck with the
older gtx 980ti for these tests but you
know the performance between the two
GPUs is roughly equivalent anyway so
it's pretty much exactly the same as
what you'd expect so let's start with
Battlefield one multiplayer set to ultra
detail settings which you can see runs
pretty well on the gtx 980ti at 1440p
hitting upwards of 75 FPS for the most
part during this match with a high
refresh panel 75 FPS does feel more
fluid than 60 FPS which can lead to a
small advantage I guess in a fast
shooter like Battlefield and of course
if you reduce some of the quality
settings pushing well into the hundred
FPS own is more than achievable even
with verizon Deus Ex mankind divided
runs pretty well at 1440p with the ultra
pro so particularly have an adaptive
sync monitor but it does only hit a 52
FPS average during the built-in
benchmark so there's not much of an
advantage to grabbing a higher fresh
monitor at these frame rates however
dropping the quality preset too high
which doesn't have much of an effect on
image quality does lead to a much better
result pushing above the 60 FPS mark
fallout 4 is a game I played a lot of
but it does have some performance issues
things like random framerate drops and
other stutters and hitches are common
throughout the game but you can get some
of those issues fixed simply by setting
the shadows to medium which is what we
did for the rest of this test and this
leads to a great result here comfortably
sitting in the 85 to 100 FPS zone not
the best optimized title all the most
visually impressive but it's a good look
at house of all the titles currently
running the GTX 980 I and 1440p prey is
a modern title built using CryEngine so
it's no surprise runs pretty well on
this sort of gaming hardware when you
aren't playing in a grass field physics
laid in the sandbox this is a title that
runs spectacularly at 1440p
regularly hitting above 100 FPS in a
less intensive parts of the games and
more like 75 FPS in the larger area so
you'll definitely benefit from having a
model that pushes above 60 Hertz when
you're hitting things like 100 FPS why
does the Tomb Raider when set to DirectX
11 mode and without super sample
anti-aliasing leads to a decent
1440p experience in the geothermal
valley with frame rates hovering around
the 60fps 3 my capture alone switch into
the high preset delivers around 10 extra
frames per second which adds the
fluidity of the game on high refresh
monitors though naturally can push the
total down even further if you really
want to deliver huge frame rates - which
is the reason all the title now been
still pretty intensive to roam this is
again that only hits around 40 FPS on
ultra settings while using my 34 40 by
1440 Predator X 34 monitor but when
switching over to this 1440p display
we're seeing around a 60 FPS average
disabling hair works improves
performance significantly and how a lot
of you guys out there love to disable
all your game works features straight
out of the box for only a minor quality
decrease while dropping the detail
preset down to high as well pushes the
average frame rate into the 80 to 90 FPS
so another sort of frame rate zone that
will benefit from that higher refresh
rate monitor watch dogs - is the most
intensive title here running it around
40 to 50 FPS using the ultra preset
1440p however this can be pushed into
the 60s with that using the high preset
and even further up into the 70s PS own
using medium preset not the best
showcase of what 165 Hertz Mario can do
at 1440p with this hardware there not
every game is going to dominate with
high frame rates at ultra detail
settings in general what you would have
seen throughout our testing is the gtx
1070 or in our case the gtx 980ti
is well suited to gaming at 1440p an
ultra detail things the GPU sits at
around 60 FPS in most modern triple-a
tiles but if you're willing to sacrifice
a few settings your framerate can push
well into the 80 to 100 FPS zone more
powerful graphics cards like the GTX
1080 or GTX 1080i I imagine a lot of
people out there building high-end
systems using those cards over the 1070
especially if you're thinking of
purchasing at $700
well those cards in high frame rates
more often at high detailed levels and
can benefit more from 165 Hertz display
at resolutions higher than 1440p such as
4k or 34 40 by 1440 ultra wide it's
unlikely you be consistently hitting
60fps at ultra detail settings
particularly at 4k and the game of the
prefers performance of a resolution this
is why 1440p
such an attractive option you'll still
get high quality gaming experience with
increased detail over 1080p but unlike
with even high resolution actually
possible to hit high frame rates on
popular graphics cards like the gtx 1070
and that's something we've demonstrated
I guess throughout this video with this
in mind it makes sense to get the most
out of gaming at 1440p and that starts
with a high refresh monitor if you use a
gtx 1070 or better a standard 60 hertz
1440p display it's likely not making the
most of your hardware if the game runs
out well above 60fps like praying ultra
quality settings your experience on a 60
Hertz monitor will be nearly as smooth
or as fluid as on a monitor that pushes
above 60 Hertz the difference in me
going to 100 Hertz is massive and
clearly noticeable while gaming is
something you really have to try
yourself to fully understand but once
you experience it it will definitely be
craving high refresh rates over higher
resolutions at 1440p there are several
options for hive and 60 Hertz monitors
the most common use in older 144 Hertz
TN panel while newer options use the 165
Hertz hhv-8 IPS panel that I discussed
earlier the superior quality of the IPS
display a 21 Hertz higher refresh rate
introduced around $150 price premium but
if you want the best quality in terms of
contrast viewing angles and colors
there's no doubting that you'll get that
with an IPS panel rather than a TN and
the additional refresh rate is a nice
bonus to have it's for this reason that
1440p models at 165 Hertz are the
ultimate option for gamers right now at
least in my opinion that's what I'd
recommend if you ask me what the best
gaming monitor is right now do an
especially good choice if you plan on
keeping this type of minor for several
years because as higher performance
graphics cards become more affordable
you'll be able to upgrade your GPU for a
reasonable price and come closer to
hitting 165 Hertz limit on these
displays in the meantime you still get
the benefit of high refresh rates where
your current hardware and in-game
graphics preferences allow I hope this
video has given you a good idea of what
to expect while gaming on a 1440p 165
Hertz monitor with reasonably affordable
hardware like the gtx 1070 and why I
reckon this is the best gaming modern
option right now
if these sorts of monitors are of
interest you can check their prices in
description below particularly for the
ViewSonic
to 7:03 SGS which we use for all of our
testing and I'll catch you in the next
one
