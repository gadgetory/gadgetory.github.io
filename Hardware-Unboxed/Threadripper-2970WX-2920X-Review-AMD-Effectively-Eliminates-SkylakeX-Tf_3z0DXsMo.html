finally able to check out the 12 and 24
course 2nd gen thread robots known as
the 29 20 X and the 2970 WX now I say
finally because it was about two
two-and-a-half months ago now that we
first checked out these 16 and 32 core
models notice the 29 50 X and the 2990
WX we have had to wait quite a while for
the 12 and 24 core parts but AMD did
warn us when we reviewed the initial
second gen thread refer parts that the
rest of the lineup wouldn't arrive until
October and I suppose we are still
October even if we are at the tail end
of October
but here we are finally able to review
them but before we get too far into the
review today's video has been sponsored
by LastPass with LastPass you don't have

and autofill into websites to make your
life much easier and so much more secure
both Tim and myself have been using
LastPass for years now so it's a service
that we trust and can highly recommend
for more information please check the
link in the video description ok so as
is often the case with these day 1
reviews we weren't given too much time
to put this thing together so that been
the case rather than massively rush all
the testing i'm going to provide two
videos there'll be a follow-up video
tomorrow which will include more gaming
benchmarks today's video is focused on
productivity benchmarks and with a very
brief look at gaming before we get into
the benchmarks here's a quick refresher
covering the design and specs there's
two models in the WX series and the W
signifies that this is a workstation
series the workstation 2990 WX and 2970
WX models are configured very
differently to the 2950 X and 29:20 X
processors whereas the 12 and 16 core
models pack two zeppelin dies the 24
core and 32 core processors feature for
typically such a configuration would
have four dual channel memory
controllers for eight channels this
however isn't possible on the X
$3.99 platform limiting these super core
heavy parts to quad-channel memory
although there are two more Zeppelin
dies the additional two dies our compute
dies in AMD's words this means they have
no local PCIe or DRAM access for that
they must travel via the Infinity fabric
to the i/o dies as there are twice as
many dies the Infinity fabric bandwidth
is also half so now the throughput
between dies is just 25 gigabits per
second assuming using ddr4 3,200 memory
because of this design that sees two of
the dies without direct access to the
DRAM it means unlike the 29 20 X and 29
50 X the 29 is 70 WX and 2990 WX use
Numa exclusively aimed a claim at this
quad Numa configuration allowed them to
create the world's first 32 core
consumer processor and just as important
as allowed them to do it while
maintaining backwards compatibility with
existing tr4 products this did cause
some compatibility issues or rather I
should say performance issues with games
and applications and I guess also the
Windows 10 operating system the Windows
10 scheduler has been proven to be very
inefficient at managing these core heavy
CPUs we found significantly better
performance when testing the same
applications with a Linux based
operating system
unfortunately this store remains a huge
problem for the 2990 W X and therefore
we suspect it will also be true for the
2970 W X and while Microsoft hasn't done
anything to improve the situation at
least yet AMD has the latest installment
of the Rison master software which will
be available for download today
introduces a dynamic local mode and
crucially to enable this mode you don't
need to reset the system in AMD's words
dynamic local mode is a new piece of
software that automatically migrates the
system's most demanding application
threads onto the thread Ripper 2990 WX
or 2970 WX CPU cores with logical memory
access
in other words applications and games
that prefer local DRAM access will
automatically receive it but
applications that scale to many cores
will still be free to do so
it's great to see AMD working hard to
improve the user experience with these
high-end desktop processors but
ultimately the biggest improvements will
come when Microsoft updates the window
scheduler for
2990 WX and 2970 WX will be safer
purchases for those using a Linux based
operating system but for certain tasks
such as rendering they are still beasts
in the Windows environment specs wise
the 12 core part is virtually identical
to the 16 core part obviously - a few
cores and the same is true in comparing
the 24 core and 32 core parts that being
the case I won't go over all the clock
speeds cache capacity and all that stuff
again that will just delay us getting to
the good stuff the benchmarks for
testing all systems work and figure with
ddr4 3,200 cell 14 memory the
quad-channel platform has received 32
gigabytes and the dual channel system 16
gigabytes the third river cpus were
benchmarked with the NM axe lick tech
360 tr4 while the sky like X CPUs used a
360 millimetre open-loop setup this
won't skew these stock performance in
Intel's favor though the coffee lake and
second gen rise and parts were both
tested with the corsair h 115 i pro and
finally the graphics card of choice is
gigabytes RT x 28 ET ID gaming OC
alright time for the benchmarks as
expected the 29:20 x roughly matches the
1920 x and 29 50x when it comes to
sustained memory bandwidth performance
the 2970 WX though its surprised with a
throughput of 67 gigabytes per second
which is a few gigabytes per second fast
in the 2990 WX and 6% more memory
bandwidth than a typical thread Ripper
CPU Cinebench single thread performances
right where we'd expect it to be the
29:20 x scored 178 points placing it on
par with the 2150 X while the 2970 WX
match the 2990 WX and the older 1920 X
of course it's the multi-threading
performance that's of most importance
for these core heavy CPUs and here we
see the 2970 WX cleaning up coming
second only to it's 32 core version a
score of roughly 4,300 points made it
just over 30% faster in the Intel Core i
979 ATX e meanwhile the 29:20 X just
edged ahead of the 1920 X making it just
25% slower than the Intel 16 core 79 60
X and in advance I'm going to apologize
for all the X's in this video
again the 2920 ex offers a small
performance improvement over the 1920 X
this time in our blender workload the
2970 WX is also a big step up from the
79 80 XE as it was again a little over
30% faster
it was also 36% faster the thread rep
429 50x taking just nine point five
seconds and that meant it was just 13%
slower than the 32 core 2990 WX
meanwhile the 2970 WX was still faster
than the 79 80 XE in Corona though
unlike the previous tests where it won
by a 30% margin or greater here it's
just 8% faster the 2920 X was again a
few percent faster in the 1920 X and 9
percent faster than the 9900 K and that
is of course running the 99 Rekha
without a TDP limit in place the last
rendering benchmark that we're going to
look at is v-ray and again the 2970 WX
makes short work of the more expensive
18 core processor from Intel he repeat
the 79 80 XC by a 22 percent margin
there was also just 13% slower than the
32 core 2990 WX so a solid result for
the new 24 core part the 29:20 X also
does well despite offering just 5% more
performance than the 1920 X and here it
was 13% faster than the core I $9.99
hundred K the PC mark 10 gaming
benchmarks shows the 2970 WX doing much
better than the 2990 WX though the 2950
X is still by far the best thread Ripper
CPU in this test and while the best CPU
overall 7-zip compression performance is
an issue for the 32 core process or at
least when testing on windows and thus
far the issue has not been addressed and
therefore we see the 12 core 29:20 X
just being the 32 core part while it's
mashed the 24 core model still when it
comes to file compression performance
Intel does appear to have a reasonably
significant advantage however when it
comes to decompression the AMD
processors certainly do come into their
own
the 2990 WX is a weapon here and the
2970 WX is also mighty impressive
beating the 79 80 XC by a 29% margin the
Microsoft Excel benchmark might be a bit
redundant
now as most of these high-end desktop
CPUs take less than two seconds to
complete the workload but we have the
results so why not include them Intel
does enjoy a slight performance
advantage in this test but with the
Monte Carlo simulation being such an
extreme workload I doubt anyone is ever
going to notice Intel's performance
advantage in this application where you
might notice Intel's performance
advantage is when working with h.265
content as their superior AVX
implementation can be seen here AMD's
really cool heavy CPUs also have an
issue with the Windows schedule in this
test which certainly doesn't help that's
the reason why the 12 core thread Ripper
CPUs are seen matching the 24 core and
32 core models that said AMD 16 core
2950 X did put up a decent fight but
even then the 79 60 X is still 14%
faster though in terms of value the
Intel CPU is still much worse since
reviewing the 2990 WX adobe premiere has
seen a major update and with that
performance of the 32 core processor has
been much improved though it's still
slightly slower than the 16 core model
still it was considerably slower
previously but 2970 WX basically match
the 2990 WX and therefore was slightly
slower than the 2950 X still while the
2950 X offers the most bang for your
buck of the higher-end thread Ripper
CPUs in premiere the 2970 WX still
stacks up well against the Intel
competition as it is just 10% slower
than these 79 80 XE then we have the new
29 20 X which also does very well though
it is only 7% faster than the 1920 X and
at launch does cost considerably more
still the 29 20 X was on par with the
core I $9.99 ok which ran much hotter
without the TDP limit here we have our
mainstream warp stabiliser test running
just a single iteration I haven't had
time to run our dozen simultaneous warp
stabilizer tests just yet but I will
include that data in future content
again the 2950 X's seem to be the best
value thread Ripper CPU it's certainly
at the high end when testing and
premiere while the higher 24 core and 32
core parts do seem to lag behind
ok guys don't freak out but for now I've
managed to squeeze in just a single game
test like I said the focus was primarily
on productivity but tomorrow I will
focus on gaming performance for the new
thread Ripper CPUs and I will have over
20 graphs for you guys to go over here
we have shadow of the Tomb Raider
providing a small sample of the work
I've done so far now here we'll start
with the 1080p data and again I'm using
the r-tx 20 atti if you want to know the
exact quality settings used please check
out Tim's optimization video for shadow
of the Tomb Raider with the dynamic
local mode enabled the 2990 WX and 2970
WX are still providing sub optimal frame
time performance though the average
frame rate isn't that bad however we do
see the 29 20 X and 29 50 X matching the
frame time performance of the 2,700 X
while beating it by a reasonable margin
for the average frame rate I actually
went back and retested the 2700 X just
to make sure there wasn't any kind of
update that improve performance but I
did get the same 93 FPS on average in
our particular pass in the game so it
seems that the 12 and 16 core thread
Ripper CPUs are offering a slight
performance increase here over the 2,700
X which I have to say is most unexpected
however once we moved to 1440p the 2,700
X is now able to roughly match the
average frame rate of the thread Ripper
CPUs while offering slightly better
frame time performance though overall
performance was much the same between
the 29:20 x 2950 X and 2,700 X they're
all comparable to the 9900 K as we are
mostly GPU bound in this title again
even with dynamic local mode enabled we
are seeing some serious frame time
issues with the 2970 WX and 2990 WX
processors this persisted even at the
extreme 4k resolution as far as I could
tell the dynamic local mode was working
but aim D has reported a few bugs with
enabling it hopefully they're sorted out
for the public release which should be
available now and perhaps I'll retest
with that version anyway as expected
with the exception of the 24 core and 32
core models we're very much GPU bound at
4k and here the 29 20 X was able to get
the most at the RT X 28 ETI moving on to
power consumption in here in Hamburg the
results might look a bit odd given the
12 core and 24 core parts are seen
pushing total system consumption to
similar levels there are however a few
reasons for this
firstly handbrake doesn't utilize the 24
and 32 core parts very well so they are
being pushed as hard as they could be
the other reasons include clock speed
and voltage the 29 20 X maintained an
all core clock speed of three point nine
five gigahertz at one point to twelve
volts while the twenty nine seventy WX
ran at just three point five five yards
using one point zero seven five volts
that's a ten percent decrease in
frequency and eleven percent decrease in
voltage blender is a better test to show
maximum system draw for these higher
core count processes and here we see the
twenty nine ninety WX pushing total
system consumption of 345 watts while
the 2970 WX consume 10 percent less
power
this time the twelve core model is seen
reducing system consumption by 15
percent which is reasonable given it
runs at higher clock speeds with more
voltage in the end when fully utilized
the twenty nine seventy WX only push
total system consumption eight percent
higher than that of this 79 80 XE and
remember it was 30 percent faster in
this workload meanwhile the twenty nine
twenty ex pushed total system
consumption of 264 watts which is
basically what we saw from the 29 50 X
and seventy nine 60 X when it came to
temperatures both CPUs run extremely
cool with the nm AK slick Tec 360 tr4 in
place we were looking at peak
temperatures of 40 to 45 degrees after
an hour long blender stress test which
is just insane
therefore I decided to remove the liquid
cooler for this test and try it a big
air cooler I went with the Wraith Ripper
the 29:20 x maxed out at just 61 degrees
after an hour and again this allowed it
to run at the same frequency and voltage
that was seen previously with the liquid
cooler on the MSI X 399 creation
unbelievably the 2970 WX ran just two
degrees hotter hitting 63 degrees again
using the wraith Ripper air cooler on
the MSI X 399 creation using the default
bios settings just XMP was loaded so
when it comes to overclocking you likely
won't be limited by thermals speaking of
which I could get both CPUs into Windows
at 4.2 gigahertz but only the 29 70 WX
was able to pass our stress tests at
that frequency the 29 20 X would pass
quite a few tests such as Cinebench and
quite a few gaming tests for example but
it would lock up after just 10 minutes
of our blender workloads and in the time
we had available
wasn't able to stabilize the overclock
that set at 4.1 gigahertz with 1.3 volts
it was rock-solid and spat out a score
of 2653 points a 6% boost over the stock
are the Box performance okay before
wrapping things up let's go over a few
performance versus price scatter plots
starting with blend up so on this graph
you want to be positioned as low as
possible and as far to the right as
possible lower of course means cheaper
and further right means faster as you
can see the blue dots which represent
the Intel CPUs well they're all higher
and more to the left term the
competition for example the thread route
for 2920 X destroyed the core i7 78 20x
it also beat out the core Oh 999 hundred
K and in terms of value the 1920 X just
destroys them all meanwhile the 2970 W X
is much cheaper and faster than the 70
960 X so an easy win there therefore for
those of you taking on 3d rendering
tasks the thread Ripper series really is
a must when it comes to video encoding
it's a bit more mixed again the ultimate
value award here must go to the 1920 X
but the new 29 20 X while not as good as
the 1920 X in terms of value it does
beat out the Intel Core i7 78 20x by a
rather convincing margin and even edged
out the ninety nine hundred K the 29 50
X also does very well but unfortunately
the 29 70 WX and 2990 W X are
underutilized and have issues with
encoding workloads particularly on the
Windows 10 operating system so at least
at the very high end of things Intel
does come out on top for this type of
workload that said the margins when
encoding with premiere are far less
brutal for AMD and while the 2990 WX is
a still worse value than these 79 60 X
you could argue that the 29 70 X
actually isn't offering reasonable
performance for a much lower price
that said the 2150 X again makes so much
more sense as it's not only faster than
the 24 and 32 core parts but it's also
cheaper the new 29-28 roughly matched
the 900k and 78 20x the Intel CPUs were
slightly better but it is a close call
of course those price vs. performance
graphs don't tell us everything about
this comparison
in terms of value now normally AMD does
tend to catch Intel out with a lower
motherboard prices along with the
inclusion of a decent box cooler but
that's not actually the case with the
thread Ripper series so the cheapest x3
99 boards they typically cost around
$300 u.s. where is the cheaper X 299
boards they start just under $200 u.s.
and this really is a factor for those
buying the lower end CPUs on these
platforms of course if you're buying a
16 called Plus CPU you're probably
looking at spending over $400 u.s. on
the motherboard and that is for either
platform as for the cooler well neither
the thread Ripper or sky like X CPUs
come with the cooler so you're looking
at a similar expense there where AMD
currently has a value advantage is in
the platform itself they offer loads of
PCIe lanes our ECC memory support and
the ability to expand beyond just 18
cause the last ones actually quite a big
one especially when third gen thread
Ripper will work on the same
motherboards so that MSI X 399 creation
that you spent $500 on won't need to be
tossed for a considerable amount of time
yet
ok so let's first talk about the thread
Ripper 29 20 X this chip has an MSRP of
$650 u.s. which is much cheaper than 800
dollars us that the 1920 X came in at
basically AMD's offering 12 cores for
the price that Intel will give you 8 and
you basically get three times the l3
cache and just over twice as many pcie
3.0 lanes and then there were just two
tests where the 78 20x actually managed
to beat the 29 20 X and those two tests
while one of them was Cinebench the
single threaded test this stomped it in
the multi-threaded and then the other
test was PC mark 10 that was very close
for all the other rendering and encoding
benchmarks the new 12 core every of a
part really did wipe the floor with the
78 20x it was basically an on contest
unfortunately I didn't have time to
retest the core I 970 900 X in time for
this video I already had to retest a lot
of CPUs so ya couldn't retest them all
but based on the data that we do have on
hand the 2920 acts will dominate that
part as well that's mostly because the
technical Intel CPU costs over 40
percent more so that's obviously a big
markup for not really much of a
performance uplift if any that just
leaves the 9900 cane honestly if
productivity tasks what you'll be
focusing on then I believe the 29 20 X
is the smarter buy it will end up
costing a little more overall but for
applications that utilize the 12 core
thread Ripper CPU well heavily
overclocked $2.99 or ok will melt trying
to keep up of course if you mostly
wanted game then the 99er ok is a better
choice there I'd recommend you forget
the note ok exists at all let's just be
honest right now pretty much doesn't
instead I'd recommend getting an 87 ok
or perhaps the 2700 X the choice is
yours so whereas I found myself with
nothing bad to say about the 29 50 X
when I reviewed it back in August it's
pretty much the same story with the 29
20 X in late October the only issue for
the 29 20 X right now is the 1920 X
selling for a little over $400 u.s.
that's the obvious choice right now and
if I were in the market for a high-end
desktop system that's what I'd be
snapping up before the stock runs out
then we have the 24 core thread Ripper
2970 WX which is a 3d rendering Beast
just like the 2990 WX unfortunately
there right now windows won't elating at
the most out of this processor in most
workloads so unless you're using or are
prepared to use Linux it's probably not
a CPU I'd recommend unless you
absolutely know it can blast its way
through whatever workload you'll be
throwing at it overall I see even less
reason to invest in Intel's X 299
platform and if AMD didn't already have
the high-end desktop market a segment
all stitched up last year they certainly
do now Tim basically summed up the
situation well in his video titled Intel
surrenders to thread Ripper with new
skylake
X refresh it's very disappointing that
Intel's remain stubborn on pricing and
just refused to become more competitive
even with the skylark X refresh but I
guess no one will be really surprised by
that anyway I'm glad we now have the 12
cord 29 20 X on the menu and I'm hoping
that we won't have to wait
too long to Windows gets an update to
better utilize the 24 and 32 core models
and well that is going to do it for this
one if you didn't race off to pick up a
1920 X then I hope that means you
