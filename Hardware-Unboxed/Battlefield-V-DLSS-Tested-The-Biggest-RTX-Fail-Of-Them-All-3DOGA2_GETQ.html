time to look at another RTX technology
one that's been causing a bit of a stir
in the community over the last week or
so that technology is invidious deep
learning super sampling or D LSS which
has finally made its way to both
battlefield 5 and Metro Exodus as is the
usual case for us we'll be going through
a full visual and performance breakdown
in this video and boy you're in for a
fun ride with this one so we're sticking
to battlefield 5 in this investigation
because according to both NVIDIA and 4a
games the implementation of DL SS in
Metro Exodus is a bit early and still
needs some polish however we haven't
heard any such issues with battlefield 5
so we're going to focus on that game for
now and maybe we'll check out Metro at a
later date depending on our schedule you
might recall that we already
investigated ELSS way back in September
of last year when we looked at the two
demos Invidia had for the launch of
their RT X GPUs the demos weren't
particularly great as they were
essentially canned benchmarks which we
felt would give invidious DLS s new
network an unrealistic advantage of
optimizing the image quality compared to
a dynamic game environment however we
still discovered back then that DL SS
performed roughly the same as reducing
the image from 4k to 1800 P while
providing roughly the same image quality
as 1800 P so wasn't exactly off to a
good start
DL SS has also been available in a real
world game Final Fantasy 15 for a little
while now but we also didn't want to
test that game because it has a terrible
anti-aliasing implementation that's
really not reflective of most other
decent games but both battlefield 5 and
Metro Xers have pretty good anti
aliasing they're not just crappy blur
filters which provides an excellent
comparison between DL SS and a high
quality native image in all DLS s games
really so far DL SS is heavily locked
down preventing you from simply and
enabling it with any combination of
settings or resolutions in the case of
battlefield 5 you must have DX our
reflections enabled to enable DL SS so
there is no option to use do SS with
ray-tracing that's already pretty
disappointing because we feel most
gamers should play with ray-tracing
switched off in this game unfortunately
you can't just use DSS to improve upon
the Ori excellent performance you get
without ray-tracing
but it's locked down further than that
on a GPU by GPU basis if you're playing
at 4k all r-tx cards can access DSS
however if you're a 1440p gamer the
option is only available for the r-tx
2080 and below so it's not available
with the RT X xx atti at 1080p
only the artex 2016-2017 can use dl SS
and there are similar limitations with
Metro Exodus according to Nvidia the
reasons for this restriction and that
activating the neural network Verde LS s
takes a fixed amount of time for each
frame as your performance level
increases DL SS begins to occupy
proportionately higher percentage of the
rendering time up to a point where for
fast GPUs it takes longer to process
deal SS than it does for the native
frame so NVIDIA has made a choice to
block users from activating DL SS in
situations where the performance uplift
is negligible or in some cases even
worse than just using native rendering
this definitely prevents DL SS for being
that one-click performance improving
feature Nvidia advertisers as many
popular configurations especially those
that deliver high frame rate gameplay
like the RT X xx atti at 1440p can't
benefit from DL SS before I jump into
the image quality comparisons this time
I wanted to go over the performance
first as always a test of battlefield 5
with micro 990 900k test rig and for
this initial batch of 4k testing I used
two g-force RT X xx atti
with all settings set to ultra the test
run was my standard battlefield 5 test
run at the beginning of the tou level so
in a classic blue benchmark chart there
are five data points we have the
performance at native 4k then
performance at 4k with ELSS enabled and
then native 1440p
crucially I've also added in performance
with the game set to 4k but with a 78%
render scale as you can see here the
performance of 4k at 78% resolution
which equates to a resolution of about
2995 by 1685 is roughly the same as 4k d
LSS
will come into play for the quality
comparison later then there's also the
performance with ray-tracing and D LSS
disables compared to native 4k rendering
which with ultra DXi reflections is only
a 40 FPS experience D LSS improves
performance by 37% looking at average
frame rates so that's not too bad again
it's the same as rendering at a 78
percent resolution scale but it's
definitely a sizeable improvement
however it doesn't bring the game
running at 4k with DX are back up to the
performance level of the game running
without ultra ray tracing switching off
DXi led to an 88% performance
improvement yeah this is ultra DXi not
low but our previous testing is showing
the performance gain going from low to
off to still be around 50% so from what
we've seen dealer says really isn't that
magic performance which this simply
brings raytrace performance back up to
the level of nerve rate racing at least
in our test conditions but the real
kicker is looking at the visual quality
comparisons will start with native 4k
versus pork ad LSS across all the scenes
I tested there is a severe loss of
detail when switching on DL SS just look
at the trees in this scene the 4k
presentation is exactly what you'd
expect sharp clean high detail on both
the foliage and trunk textures but DL SS
is like a strong blur filter has been
applied texture detail is completely
wiped out in some cases it's like you've
loaded a low texture mode while some of
the fine branch detail has been blurred
away or even thickened in some cases
which makes the game look kind of weird
in some situations of course this is to
be expected DL SS was never going to
provide the same image quality as native
4k while also providing a 37 percent
performance uplift that would be well
pretty much black magic but the quality
difference comparing the two is almost
laughable in how far away DL SS is from
the native presentation in these
stressful areas
it gets worse though and we'll switch to
a different scene for this one here is a
comparison between D LSS and our 78
percent resolution scouts a roughly 16
85 P which we found to perform exactly
the same as d LSS not just in our test
run but also in a variety of other
scenes it's a complete non contest the
1685 P image just
Troy's the DSS image in terms of
sharpness texture quality clarity
basically everything just look at the
quality difference between these two
areas when zoomed in the 78% scaled
image preserves the fine detail on the
rocks to sign the sandbags the cloth for
gun pretty much everywhere with DL SS
everything is blurred to the point that
this detail is lost
and we're not talking about a situation
where DL SS is noticeably better at
anti-aliasing the 1685 p image is
already using battlefields taa
implementation which is quite good there
are some instances where DL SS is
smoother looking at extremely fine
detail when zoomed reveals less area
Singh in thin tree branches but this has
come at the complete loss of detail in
the foliage on the trees and well
everywhere else as well and our only
spot of this winds room din looking at
the full image on a regular 4k PC
monitor it's hard to tell the difference
in aliasing because the pixel count is
already very high and the non DLS s
presentation with taa removes most of
the key artifact students spot without
anti-aliasing
this leaves DL SS simply looking like
Vaseline has been smeared on the display
that last scene was particularly bad for
DL SS but there's a common theme
throughout the areas I tested and we're
not even talking about DL SS versus
native 4k here we're talking about DL SS
versus the 1685 P image upscale to 4k
both of which deliver the same
performance 1685 P is a little behind
native 4k in terms of sharpness as you'd
expect from upscaling but D LSS is miles
behind either of them in some situations
I wouldn't even say DL SS is superior to
a 1440p image upscale to 4k 1440 pcs are
further loss of fine detail to the image
and in some environments DSS can restore
that detail and smooth out any jagged
artifacts however the deal that says
image is still very soft and blurred
often with lower texture detail than
1440p it depends on the environment and
it's definitely a lot closer than some
of our previous comparisons but a lot of
the same problems remain it gets closer
again if you downscale the 4k DLS s
image - native 1440p and do the
comparison that resolution rather than
upscaling both to 4k but even then
isn't clearly better the problem I feel
is that battlefield 5 s regular taa
implementation is too good so perfect or
anything but it's pretty good and
doesn't blur out the image like taa can
do in other games Final Fantasy 15 for
example was quite blurry with ta enabled
compare that taa image to DL SS in that
game and yeah the image quality is
pretty similar but battlefield 5 is
sharper overall and DLS s simply can't
match up in fact the native and scaled
images completely obliterate the blurry
mess that is Dale SS I did do some brief
testing at 1440p as well this time with
an RT X 2070 here DL SS performs more in
line with an 84% resolution Scout so
roughly 2150 by 12 10 delivering a
modest 18% performance improvement over
native 1440p part of this is due to
1440p performing better on the RT x 2070
then 4k does on the 20 80 TI with ultra
DX r the other part is the RT x 20 70 s
more limited RT and tensor called
resources again we're seeing most of the
same problems at 1440p as we did at 4k
the DL SS image is softer and blurrier
compared to upscaling at 12:10 p.m. egde
to 1440p in some areas there is less
area Seng but that advantage is not
worth it when the overall image is so
blurry
DLS s is an improvement in some areas
over native 1080p but again it's not an
overall victory so there's really no
other way to put it DL SS sucks
from what we've seen testing in
battlefield 5 as well as Metro X's which
is supposed to be still a non perfect
implementation DL SS is complete garbage
and a huge waste of time a lot of people
hated on ray-tracing in the
implementations we've seen so far but to
me DL SS is by far the worst of the two
key RT x features the problems with DSS
aren't even all that hard to summarize
DL SS provides much worse image quality
than upscaling from a resolution that
provides equivalent performance for 4k
gamers with the 2080 ti our upscaled
1685 p image looked far better than DL
SS while providing an equivalent
performance uplift over native 4k at
1440p
scaling from 1210 P also looks better
than D LSS this is a significantly worse
outcome than our initial D LSS
investigation
previously in an optimal canned
benchmark D LSS looked and performed
like an 1800 P image so provided no
benefit here D LSS looks worse than a
1685 P image at the same performance so
enabling D LSS in a real-world game like
Battlefield v is actually worse than
using simple resolution upscaling that's
been available in games for decades and
that's why D LSS is complete rubbish at
least with ray tracing we're getting a
superior image than what we had before
at admittedly a high performance cost
but with D LSS we're not gaining
anything in either the performance or
visuals department compared to
traditional techniques this is kind of
what I feared when D LSS was first
demonstrated while not all that
impressive in kin demos either I assumed
having a highly repeatable benchmark
with the exact same frames in each run
will present the absolute best case
scenario for the AI based reconstruction
DL SS uses the AI could just train
itself on high resolution samples of the
exact frames it will then reconstruct
later but games are far more dynamic
than this it's impossible at this stage
to train a neural network for every
single frame a game could output so when
D LSS is paired with a real-world game
not just a can demo it completely falls
apart trying to reconstruct frames it's
never seen before because this is a
neural network that is constantly
learning yeah dealer says could improve
over time but they gap between DL SS and
our equivalent up scaled images are so
large that who knows how long it will
take for D LSS to catch up if it's even
possible right now though it's clearly a
bust there are going to be some times
where the comparison between D LSS on
and off will be more favorable even in
dynamic games tunnels that have crappy
anti-aliasing implementations such as
Final Fantasy 15 or more recent games
like resident evil 2 if TAA already
quite blurry so if you compared the
already blur ETA to deal assess both
would simply look blurry and DL SS would
look a lot better but many modern tiles
have been optimizing T
to look better than ever preserving much
more detail than older implementations
and dealer says simply can't keep up and
battlefield 5 is being pretty much a
prime example here and this is without
mentioning all the limitations that come
with DL SS including limited resolution
support depending on the GPU you have
and for battlefield fight have the
inability to use the LSS with that rate
race on top of that Nvidia admits this
is basically useless for high frame rate
gaming unlike resolution upscaling which
works across everything for deal it says
to actually be useful several things
need to happen
Nvidia needs to find a way to make it
less restricted then it needs to do one
of two things either they need to
improve the reconstruction techniques to
make image quality massively better than
what we're getting today or they need to
find a way to make DL SS run better so
the performance uplift is much larger
and because I'm not talking about a
minor improvement but a major
improvement here it's going to be a
pretty hard task as it stands today D
LSS in battlefield 5 is so bad I think
it actually should be removed from the
game entirely gamers are potentially
being robbed of either extra performance
or extra visual quality through choosing
to use deal SS over the less frequently
talked about resolution scaling setting
having the saying in the game might
tempt gamers into using it when it at
best provides no benefit and at worst is
actually degrading the experience only
when DL SS is at least equivalent to
resolution scaling should the feature
then be reintroduced into the game
unfortunately DL SS was a feature that
people were thinking would be the best
of the r-tx features judging by the way
in video was selling it the claims
essentially amounted to a free
performance uplift thanks to the power
of AI and that's what a lot of gamers
thought that get but the reality is
pretty much so far from this though it's
basically laughable and that's basically
it for my thoughts on DL SS all of this
stuff is also true for metro Exodus but
considering that implementation is
apparently still not final yet I didn't
want to do a deep dive on it just yet in
fact I probably won't unless updates
make it noticeably better than in
battlefield 5 right now my
recommendation for DL SS across all
games basically just don't use it play
around with your resolution scaling
sliders to see how the performance of
visual impact will improve your
experience there if you like this sort
