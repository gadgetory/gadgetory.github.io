recently we did check out how the Radeon
RX Vega 64 and GeForce GTX 1080 stacked
up in 2018 using the latest drivers and
batch of games it was a pretty even
fight across the 27 games tested but
there were a few big wins going in
videos way and this did allow the GTX
tane to win by a 5% margin over all the
games that offered support for DirectX
11 and DirectX 12 I did test both the
api's I did notice some very mixed
results which I didn't discuss in the
previous benchmark video so that was
something we could quickly do now so I
don't think I need to explain too much
more I think we'll just talk about the
test system and then we'll get to the
benchmark results so as usual I'm using
our Corsair GPU test rig which uses the
core i7 87 okay which is clocked at 5
gigahertz and it has 32 gigabytes of
ddr4 3400 memory I know this will come
up with a few of you and would have been
nice if we had have included the Rison
720 700 X but due to time constraints
because there is a bit going at the
moment I wasn't able to update with all
those results and believe it or not that
kind of testing does take quite a large
amount of time and as I said I just
don't have that time available at the
moment and this is testing I would like
to do but I think at this point I will
reserve it for the next-generation GPUs
anyway we have half a dozen titles to
check out so let's get into it
first up we have the battlefield 1
results and here we see when using the
DirectX 11 API the performance between
Vegas 64 and the GTX 1080 is very
similar we see the exact same 106 FPS on
average with a slightly better 1% lower
result for the radio and GPU however
once we move to DirectX 12 the GTX 1080
falls away while Vegas 64 maintains the
same performance scene when using DX 11
so providing you have a high-end CPU it
doesn't really matter which API Vega
owners use while GeForce owners will
certainly want to stick with DirectX 11
this time when testing with day 6
mankind Nevada we see a similar average
frame rate using either DirectX 11 or
DirectX 12 the GTX 1080 was just 4 to 5
FPS slower than the value graphics card
in both situations however we see a
rather hefty 11% drop-off for the 1%
result when using DirectX 12 which is
obviously a very bad result in theory
the low-level API should offer better
frame time performance but in this
implementation it's much worse this
leads me to conclude that anyone with a
high end CPU should avoid DirectX 12
entirely for this title here we see the
complete opposite the MPC heavy hit man
runs world's better using DirectX 12 for
both the Radeon and GeForce GPUs the
performance uplift really is massive but
please note this hasn't always been the
case about a year ago now there was very
little difference between the two api's
and we found for the most part that dx11
was more consistent today though the GTX
1080 is 18% faster than using DirectX 12
and Vega 64 was a whopping 27 percent
faster truly massive gains there that
means anyone playing hitman will
certainly want to make sure they're
using the DirectX 12 API
moving on to some testing with Sniper
Elite 4 here we see the GTX tonight you
have a significant advantage when using
DirectX 11 however once we test both
GPUs using DX 12 we find a very similar
performance performance that is
comparable to the GTX 280s dx11 result
warhammer vermintide 2 will likely play
better using DirectX 12 with a Loren CPU
but with a high-end CPU it seems DirectX
11 is the way to go at least with Vegas
64 even the GTX 1080 sees a massive 16
percent drop in performance for the 1%
low result we're using DirectX 12
opposed to DirectX 11 and this isn't the
first time we're seeing such a result so
once again for high end hardware we
recommend using DirectX 11 and this
gives Vegas 64 a notable advantage
Warhammer 2 throws up some mixed results
here we see Vegas 64 actually providing
better performance using DirectX 11
while the GTX 1080 is much the same
using either API an odd result but it's
another example of how baked in DirectX
12 performs okay so we're now deep into
2018 despite that we're still seeing
mixed DirectX 12 performance and quite
shockingly it's some of the oldest dx12
titles that are now showing the best
results with the more modern API despite
lacking full hardware support and video
husband a little workaround Pascal
shortcomings with driver trickery though
we have seen
this impact the performance of certain
CPUs namely those from AMD
I should just note the margins between
DirectX 12 and DirectX 11 will vary
depending on the CPU used Laurin CPUs
may benefit more from DirectX 12 but for
high-end rigs using well high-end CPUs
and GPUs it's quite clear that you will
need to do some research to work out
which API are work best in a given title
it was quite surprising to see the Vega
64 really only offered a performance
boost over the GTX 1080 and DirectX 12
titles such as battlefield one and yeah
it was just battlefield one wasn't it so
hmm
oh and for those of you donning the red
warrior face paint this was a DirectX 11
versus DirectX 12 comparison so that's
why the only true Vulcan games worth
testing were included I know that's
going to come up so much in the comments
why don't you test volc√°n it always
comes up DirectX 11 DirectX 12 is the
reason here and on that note I'm running
