already covered a fair few of Intel's
CPU related announcements from a couple
of days ago including the said 390
chipset and motherboard launch to the
new 8 core processors and hopefully you
all saw Steve's video yesterday covering
Intel's ridiculous Commission benchmarks
of the 9900 K more than a week before
anyone can report independent
performance numbers in fact if you
happen to miss our update to that video
we discovered that the Commission
benchmarks were even worse than we first
thought if that's even possible because
all testing was done with the horizon
720 700 X configured as a quad-core
through game mode yep pretty
unbelievable stuff really but that's
what they did to get such massive
margins check our patreon post with the
new graphs and all the details links to
that are in the description below also
intel has responded to us and others
with the statement basically doubling
down and saying the testing is valid
check out gamers Nexus latest video for
that statement but Wow seriously Intel
anyway let's move on today we're talking
about something a little different it's
time to talk about the other thing Intel
announced their new line of high-end
desktop chips in the form of sky like X
refresh and the 28 core
Xeon w31 75 X remember the 28 core
processor yeah that's the one Intel
first announced at Computex 2018 it's
been capable of 5 gigahertz except only
with what was later discovered to be
exotic cooling and a ridiculous overkill
motherboard at the time you might have
seen our video comparing Intel's
misleading 28 core demo to Abi's
announcement of 32 core thread Ripper an
actual product that ended up as the 2990
WX that processor it was a bit
disappointing in how it performed in
some workloads but it did actually get
released as a product that closely
matched what AMD announced at Computex
so let's take a look at what Intel's 28
core CPU has ended up as after the
fiasco at Computex well the company
decided to call it the xeon w-30 175 X
and is based on their cascade Lake
architecture it also in what shouldn't
be surprised anyone
is compatible only with Intel's LGA 3647
server sockets so those currently using
X 299 boards with the LGA 2066 socket
can't just drop in this new CPU without
a full platform upgrade the thread
Ripper 2990 WX was fully compatible with
AMD socket TR 4 and X 399 chipset but
Intel doesn't have the luxury of socket
compatibility with their new high core
count CPUs in terms of specifications
the xeon Platinum 8180 has 28 cos 38.5
megabytes of level 3 cache 44 PCIe lanes
directive CPU and 6 channels of ddr4
2666 memory support either ECC or
standard sorry wait did I say the xeon
Platinum 8180
before well I meant the of course here
on w 3175 x bit of an easy mistake to
make there because they're of course
totally different CPUs the 3175 X does
beef things up a bit compared to the
8180 though especially in terms of clock
speeds Intel's totally different and not
on all the same server chip is clocked
at 2.5 gigahertz with a boost up to 3
point 8 gigahertz whereas the 31 75 X is
clocked at 3.1 gigahertz base and 4.3
gigahertz boost this also means a TDP
increase from 205 watts to 255 watts not
because this is basically an overclocked
80 180 or anything but because of some
other reason I don't know it's also
fully unlocked like all of Intel's h EDT
processes the key thing to note here is
Intel's 3175 X is not clocked at 5
gigahertz not as a base clock not as an
all core turbo and not even as a single
core turbo clock and that's of course
because reaching 5 gigahertz on a 28
core CPU is completely ridiculous for
typical operating conditions can the 31
75 X hit 5 gigahertz using exotic
cooling well probably but again this
brings us back to intel's initial reveal
of the 28 core 8 EDT chip they showed it
running at 5 gigahertz plenty of
websites and gobbled that up without
even questioning it and yet here we are
the actual chip has been officially
released and it doesn't clock anywhere
near 5 gigahertz I do get that Intel
came out and apologized for not
mentioning that their demo involved in
overclocked CPU but that whole set up
left me and many of you guys with a sour
taste in your mouth I mean it's not
exactly the first time Intel has misled
consumers but that 28 core
Bell was pretty bad of course the key
thing with this product that remains up
in the air is the price tag Intel's
top-end 18 core skylake extra refresh
cpu which we'll get to in a moment costs
$2,000 or so while the Zeeland platinum
8180 costs a cool ten thousand dollars
considering the xeon w31 75 ex is
basically a better higher clocked 8180
who knows what sort of price tag it will
command will entail prices above the
8180 i mean they can't make it too cheap
or Intel would cannibalize 8180 sales so
without a daddy will be a very very
expensive product and who knows how
competitive it will be against a mb's 32
core offering and then there's the
motherboards built to support this
process which appear virtually unchanged
from what Intel used at Computex the
asou ROG Dominus Xtreme has two 24-pin
power connectors plus four eight pin
connectors and two six pins plus a
monstrous vrm solution it's possible all
these connectors are just to facilitate
overclocking the chip but that still
seems like a ridiculous setup when again
the 2990 WX works just fine on x3 ninety
nine boards and can be overclocked with
that needing to 24 pin connectors and
while we don't have pricing for the
Dominus you can bet it will be very
expensive to go along with the 31 75 X
so like we predicted at Computex it
seems like the 31 75 X is a marketing
stunt and Intel's attempt to have the
world's fastest single socket CP or
something along those lines because it's
highly unlikely that it will be a
product worth purchasing for the vast
majority of bias even among those
thinking is spending thousands of
dollars just on a workstation CPU this
28 core base will almost certainly be a
much much worse value by than either
Intel's LG 1866 products or enemies
thread Ripper now let's move into
talking about Intel skylake X refresh
otherwise known as basement falls
refresh so what we have here is a
selection of CPUs ranging from 8 cores
and 16 threads up to 18 cores and 36
threads essentially replacing Skylark
acts with equivalent parts the six core
i7 7800 X doesn't have a direct
replacement with this refreshed lineup
instead the i7 1900 X is an 8 core chip
and then it goes up from there so
there's a couple of interesting things
to note here spec wise nearly every part
has receive
a clock speed boost both to the bass and
boost clock the 18 core I 999 80 XE
jumps up from 2.5 gigahertz base and 4.4
gigahertz boost to 3.0 gigahertz pace
and 4.5 gigahertz boost within the same
165 watt TDP some chips have smaller
bumps but generally we're seeing gains
from 100 to 400 megahertz while the TDP
isn't a good metric for power
consumption the fact that the chips have
a higher base clocks under the same TDP
could suggest better efficiency possibly
from manufacturing them on 40 nanometer
+ + rather than 40 nanometer + we'll
have to test them to find out for sure
of course other interesting things are
all chips now have a 165 watt TDP
previously the 12 quart and lower were
140 watts but now everything is the full
165 Watts l3 caches also been improved
for the 12 quart and lower CPU jumping
from as low as 11 megabytes in the 8
core 78 20 X - 16 point 5 megabytes in
the i7 98 20x the 8 core also gets a
full 40 for PCIe lanes previously it was
restricted to just 28 lanes and guessing
this was done to give people a reason to
buy it over the eight core I $9.99
hundred K of course on platforms like I
said 390 the other somewhat unusual
thing is the introduction of a second 10
core processor it looks like this was
done to keep the line up at 7 SKUs but
with Intel ditching the 6 core that had
to double up one SKU in some way so in
the base model 9800 X is now 8 cores the
98 20 X is 10 cores and the 9900 X world
that resumes normal proceedings at 10
cores as well considering all skylight
extra fresh chips are unlocked do you
think the higher-end 9900 X wouldn't be
worth buying as it's a hunt dolls more
expensive and only gives you clock speed
boost so you could definitely achieve on
the 98 20x with overclocking
however the 9900 X does feature more
level through a cache which could come
in handy depending on the workload it
won't be a big deal for a lot of users
who would likely be better off with the
98 20 X Bears at least one reason to go
for the 9900 X instead now that all
that's out of the way the most
interesting thing by far here is that
Intel hasn't been aggressive on pricing
whatsoever they've basically completely
ignored ambe's thread Ripper platform
and gone with the exact same pricing
they're used for previous skylake x
parts the I $9.99 80 XE is the same 1979
dollar US of course trade price as the
i9 79 80 XE for example and that holds
true for the rest of the line the only
potentially better value product here is
the 889 dollar ten core iron 998 20x
which offers a $100 say beyond the ten
core higher nine seventy nine hundred x
but otherwise is just a bit strange that
nothing else has become more competitive
for example ambi is currently selling
the 16 core thread Ripper 29 50 X for
nine hundred dots which is a great buy
as a versatile workstation CPU capable
of handling most multi-core workloads
with these Intel's direct competitor is
still just a 10 core CPU which the 2950
X will handle the smoke inverse
workloads where it's the 14 and 16 core
chips there will be much more
competitive yet the 14 core is still
priced at around $1400 500 dollars more
than the 29 50 X while the 16 core sets
you back a huge $1,700 it just seems a
little bizarre to me that Intel hasn't
even bothered to make skylake X more
competitive it's almost like they are
straight up handing aim to your win in
this market to ensure they don't eat any
of their Zeeland sales sure when you
compare this new generation solid
Intel's last generation of h EDT chips
you are getting slight clock speed bumps
and more cash for the same price but
Intel was quite far behind thread Ripper
in terms of value and after this launch
well they remained so and I haven't even
mentioned ambe's 32 core 2990 WX in this
part of the video yet which retails for
$1,800 and will remain in competition
with Intel's 18 core I $9.99 ATX C at
$2,000 neither of these chips are great
value buyers but again it's interesting
that in the workloads where AMD's multi
die design excel like 3d modeling and
rendering thread Ripper will still be
offering much more performance at a
lower cost so a bit of a strange
launching from Intel we have new skylake
extra fresh processes that don't seem
any more competitive against the red
ripper than the previous generation with
only minor clock speed bumps at the same
price alongside a 28 chord ship that
will likely cost a sweet fortune
requires a ridiculous motherboard with
loads of power connectors and doesn't
clock anywhere
near five gigahertz I'm not really sure
what the point of this lineup is in many
ways I think Intel would have been
better off simply keeping the original
Skylark X on the market and giving it a
price cut that way they'd save
engineering resources and would be more
competitive with AMD instead what we've
got is a pretty disappointing refreshed
lineup that really doesn't look like
offering anything intel didn't already
provide perhaps their struggles with ten
nanometer have led to this they can't
transition actually to really any chips
to ten nanometers yet to make use of
their long-awaited new architecture and
all the benefits of a node shrink and
they also can't add any more callers
without redoing the entire design which
would be pointless on 14 nanometers or
of course they could shift to a new
platform and they did the ladder with
the Xeon w31 75 X they can't simply bump
up a six core CPU up to eight core and
call it a day which is pretty much what
they did with the 9700 K and 9900 K let
me know what you guys think about this
new lineup in the comments below
interested to hear your thoughts and
whether you think any of these CPUs will
be competitive with thread Ripper as
