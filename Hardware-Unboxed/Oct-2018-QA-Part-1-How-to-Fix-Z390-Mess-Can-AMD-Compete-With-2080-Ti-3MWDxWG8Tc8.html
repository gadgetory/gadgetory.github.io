time for the october QA so we've asked
you guys to ask some questions and we've
picked about 20 of the most popular ones
and will answer about half of those in
part one and then part two will probably
be in a few days because we're currently
at the pax Australia pax so we're doing
all that kind of coverage yeah but we
thought we'd start the monthly QA
squeeze it in between there before we
get benchmarking next week so anyway
let's get into the questions okay we've
got Tim all pumped up he's ready to go
so we'll get into the first question
this one is from element 86
so that is a discord member he bought me
those cool she's near the harbour unbox
back plate my Master's pretty cool I may
ask how you got that so I have to speak
to him and see if we can order one of
the one for Tim a mass but anyway his
question is I noticed Tim's seat our
sorry set has some nice-looking seats
now your seat doesn't ever sit you set
up some seats what are they and are they
comfortable though these are them we put
these together yeah when we built this
we did it behind the scenes video for
that did you I was gonna film the final
destination so I spent a couple weeks
painting the final desk so I wanted to
get that done factum so that will be
coming I think I mentioned in the last
Q&amp;amp;A but we're yeah these are the Corsair
they caused the exact mold of them
yeah they caused a tea to race up yeah
yeah so here we go you ready
whoa but they're pretty cool they've got
just nearly knocked an x-wing off a
table
yeah well yeah some wheels on the bottom
rollerblade wheel tuck things they're
fully adjustable I did I think you've
lost was it last month QA that I did the
old recline all the way back yeah yeah
they are actually they're very
comfortable they're very very nice
these I think it's the I said t2 did not
yeah yeah so I've got the tea or one
race in moisture I think yeah the
teacher Road Warrior something like that
but yeah the the t1 is much more narrow
and hugs you a lot more so this is the
big man
nice negative stylus nice and white yeah
it's good it's really yes so Corsair t2
to answer your question is what we're
using a course they sent a pair of those
for Tim and I to do our live stream in
QA so yeah they're nice okay I'm not a
discord based question here any plan on
testing new gtx 1066 gigabyte gddr5 x
and what about the other 1066 gigabyte
that apparently are based on some GP 104
iteration yeah well I've been out of the
loop on that news I didn't even hear
about that I heard about the gddr5 X
version no and yeah well we'll
definitely benchmark that ii we can get
our hands on it see what difference
there is I'm not sure I haven't done we
recently did the memory scaling video
with the RT X 2070 2080 and 2080 Ti and
we noticed yes some interesting results
there with your if you have a clocked in
memory while keeping the cause stop
there is a bit of a performance uplift
in some games not amazing but a little
bit some games nothing the GTX 1060 I've
personally haven't really done much
testing so it came with eight gigabytes
per second memory initially didn't it
and then it got a nine gigabits per
second version when the RT X 580
launched yeah and from memory that was
more of a gimmick it didn't seem to make
much difference despite the fact that
some people claim that it's heavily
memory limited and that overclocking the
memory on the GTX 960 really helps I'm
not saying that's not true it just
didn't seem to be when they're nine
gigabits per second version you make
much difference but yeah we'll test it
you're nothing add to that GP 104
iteration we're not sure whether that's
because of the gddr5 X whether it's
related to the gddr5 X version or not
but as far as testing that that one
should perform exactly the same because
I'll just cut everything down to exactly
the same as JP 106 assuming that the
yeah the coup de coeur counts the same
and everything else memory bus width and
all that I mean it seems like they might
be doing that to sort of get rid of the
Pascal inventory that competes with
cheering that's been some people's
thoughts on why they might be well TP
one oh this is this is all news to me my
thoughts straight away after hearing
this just moments ago
would be that they've got a lot of a lot
of dies that are more
effective or so defective if they can't
be GTX ten 70s yeah I mean that's the
obvious thing that they usually and they
don't have a 1060 TI that's based on
that die so yeah they're just I don't I
don't have a problem with that that's
fine as long as it's the same spec and
you get the same performance power
consumptions much the same pricing ends
up being much the same then as far as
I'm saying that is still a gtx 1060 okay
next question is from sal Kagan again
another patreon member what would you
guys like to see from motherboard
vendors in the future
given the sort of issues said 390
appears to be having okay we just talked
about this at length on our patreon
livestream so I'm gonna let you take
this one to begin with yeah what do we
want to say well I think s we've got to
start with have this kind of like the -
Intel specifications of you've got your
your base frequency your TDP you got
sort of your limits you know some other
boards obviously at the moment we've
discovered hit that 95 watt limit after
a short period of time I in sort of your
longer workloads so yeah and then on top
of that you got your higher end
specification that's for example running
at the all core maximum turbo frequency
for an unlimited amount of time that's
what we tested personally with our 900k
testing so it seems like we're in a
situation where some boards can only do
that minimum specification because if
they're VRMs aren't up to scratch or
they've got you know just some sort of
configuration that's limiting them there
and then there's some boards that can do
your maximum spec like what we tested so
it seems we're in a position where it
needs to be made a bit more clear from
other board vendors whether they're
going to support that minimum spec or
this point the maximum spec so some sort
of yeah into fire with I suppose we'll
just focus on the Zed 390 example
because this sort of bleeds over into
other platforms a little bit but this is
a more extreme example I suppose with
the Intel spec being so broad yeah you
know you can have a board that we'll all
call boost the 99 or okayed a 4.2 or
possibly less 4.7 is what you'd expect
to do because that's what it should do
without any overclocking so I think the
main thing from board manufacturers we'd
like to see is what everyone's been
talking about now for a while is
actually
find what a phase is and don't call an
eight phase-- or don't call a four phase
mother born eight phase motherboard just
because there's a doubling of components
without doublers so legitimate you know
phase counts that would probably help
for a start yeah
because a four phase board probably
won't handle the noise owner cave that
well especially overclocked for a long
period of time that's a lot of stress on
the VRM so get define that correctly and
then tying him with what Tim was saying
if the board is limited to 95 watts say
yeah it's it supports ninth gen
processors its support to the 900 K at
95 Watts yeah and then it this is this
sort of comes back on Intel a bit I'd
like them to have it as a configurable
TDP so the 900 K is either a 95 watt to
one 45 watt part yeah that make a lot
more sense yeah and it also would give
motherboard manufacturers a reason for
people to buy a more expensive board
because then you'd have your low tier
boards that are your 95 watt boards and
then they could say you know well we've
got our premiums at 390 board that's you
know if that supports the same CP 141 so
you get more performance and that will
give people a reason to sort of spend
that a little bit more to get their
upper tier products which are better
suited to those CPUs that's a much much
more friendly approach for the buyer
because if you know that there's so many
boards that you're looking gigabyte
asrock MSI any when you look at the
whole slew of boards and it might be the
difference between spending you know $30
more we'll get you a board that has no
problem running the CPU at full
performance whereas if you saved $30
then you've got to manually remove the
limit and then all of a sudden it's
running a bit hotter than it you'd
probably like it to especially if you're
doing a lot of things like rendering and
stuff like that so you did bigger
problem than has ever been with
motherboards and the wide variety of
stuff that Intel allows you to do within
their specification we really need to
sort of be you know testing motherboards
more and making it more obvious for
buyers what a motherboards actually
providing you it's no longer the days we
could just buy one off the shelf and
they'll work the same there is
definitely differences between each one
so absolutely yeah a lot of work to be
done there mm-hmm
okay next question this looks all it's
been directed at both of us from a
patreon member but I think this is one
for Tim because
covers both of the things you like to
look into do you know why there aren't
laptops with VA panels that's very much
a Tim question yeah I thought about this
for a while and there's sort of a few
things I had sort of thought of I think
the most sensible explanation for this
is simply that their panels aren't made
in super high densities so for example
you can't there's no 4k VA panels of a
monitor size at the moment for TVs there
are but four monitors typically we're
seeing them top out at about 1440p
27-inch 32 inch that's the most common
configuration for VA so it seems like
there is potentially that sort of
density issue they can't make like a
high resolution laptop size display
using VA technology whereas IPS for
example which is kind of that equivalent
for laptops you know you can make a 5
inch phone display at 1440p using IPS
LCD technology so yeah yeah that's why I
was sort of like I'm not 100% sure I
haven't asked any manufacturers yes so
yeah comment on that but I was thinking
there's no real other reason why VA
couldn't be useful that drops the power
consumption compared to IPS is very
similar it's got good viewing angles
which is another reason why you'd use
IPS for laptops so yeah I think it just
comes down to however they've designed
this sort of crystals in there not being
able to get to the densities that you
need for a 13 inch or 15 inch laptop
screen ok next question do you think
that AMD will be able to compete with
the art x20 atti or will they play it
safe and offer something competitive
with the r-tx 2080
like they did with vega 64 like they did
with the vega 64 i mean it's interesting
question I think that yeah they should
be able to compete on 7 nanometre with
Navi hope so
with the ITX 2080 I think with Vega they
were limited by the process technically
they decided to use for Vega which I
believe was 14 nanometers so the issue
that they has that that a very wide CPU
design there's a lot of stream
processors in the Vega design but they
couldn't clock it as competitively as
they could as Nvidia could with their
chips that used a different process tech
yeah so they certainly
do have a design that if they could get
it to clock higher would be competitive
with today's top end chips
but with the future technology when
we're most likely will have both Nvidia
and AMD on TSMC 7 nanometre we're going
to be in a situation where yeah both
companies should be able to make very
competitive shoebox as one on one in
another so yeah I would expect
definitely that with Navi we should be
getting 20 atti from like performance
what do you reckon very much hope so I
would think so it's kind of like it's
why those situations we saw with the FX
series coming to horizon we all hoped
horizon would be good but there's always
doubts yeah no I wasn't comfortable this
way I never thought it would turn out as
well as it has yep so hopefully nabhi is
the same situation okay question here
could you make a video exploring under
vaulting CPUs in today's age it seems
like everyone wants to overclock I'd be
interesting to see what kind of
performance their most power consumption
you can get from something like an a 700
K or a 2700 X at 0.9 volts yeah that's
definitely something we could do yeah I
haven't really thought about it too much
interesting question I've actually been
doing a lot of under vaulting on my 9900
K I've taken that as low as it'll
possibly go well maintaining some sort
of stability to see what they if I could
get the power draw down to what we were
seeing on some of the 95 what limited
boards that wasn't the case yeah that's
definitely something we could look into
sort of separate video they're looking
at under vaulting CPUs and people that
want to be efficient yeah well it's and
it's basically it's an under clocking
but it's the same rules as overclocking
so just because I can under volt to a
certain level doesn't mean you can yeah
it's still a silicon lottery thing but
interesting all the same so don't thing
I have too much more to say on that at
the moment but yeah something we can
definitely look into all right another
question from YouTube does the
performance gain by using 3200 CL 14
versus CL 16 for rise and justify paying
so much more for a 16 gig kit well I'm
yeah just going to assume that it is a
lot more I don't know the exact price
but let's just say it is a lot more does
is it justified well first of all it
depends on what you're doing and what
you're doing it with I suppose so if
you're doing productivity type tests
rendering and coding all that kind of
stuff no is the answer it won't really
improve in coding time by a whole lot I
haven't done any recent tests but is
that your experience you know a huge
amount of advantage there I know when we
did the sub timing stuff which really
helped gaming had very little impact on
productivity the next part of that is
okay so let's say this is a gaming
related question what are you gaming
with if you're game with an RT X xx atti
then yeah you'll probably see a nice
performance uplift 10-15 percent if you
go with the GTX 1060 then know you'll
see no performance uplift in pretty much
any game so yeah it really comes down to
what you're gaming with and if you're
game with an RT X if you don't say a GTX
1080 or higher than spending the extra
whatever it is on faster memory is a
non-issue so I have to assume that
you're using a sort of mid-range to
lower end card so in that case not
doesn't matter just get your CL 16 stuff
and you can also tune your memory yeah
so you might be able to add that downer
cell to 15 this the secondary time as
you can probably tune up a bit so you
can probably get pretty close to stock
sale 14 performance there anyway okay
why does SLI slash crossfire need to be
optimized for by developers could it be
standardized and native to the operating
system and to applications okay so
that's like a DirectX 11 DirectX 12
photo yeah so yeah it is kind of split
between the DirectX 12 and DirectX 11
conversation because on DirectX 11 if
you go into the driver seat you can
actually force SLI on familiy much every
game it just doesn't necessarily dictate
how well it works yeah could buy this
game it's just that you can actually
enable it because it you know uses
certain types of rendering technologies
yeah and I guess the reason why it needs
to be optimized is that there needs to
be a lot of resource allocation between
the you know getting everything synced
up nicely and game engines are very
different very different between each
different games so it's not necessarily
the case that a game that has
great scaling could be applied to every
single game engine by just like some
sort of operating system native
standardization methods so yeah because
of that it's it's similar to any game
really you know even if you're not
running SLI a game needs to be optimized
for the hardware at hand so sy just know
step needs to be optimized for that as
well yes just another feature yeah and
if if SLI was the thing that for some
reason everyone used everyone had to
graphics cards then you would see it
pretty much in every game yeah but it's
because it's so nice that developers
don't feel the need to optimize for and
on dx12 it's a different sort of story
because for that developers have the
control over the true GPU setup so they
can control exactly what they use each
GPU for they don't have to necessarily
be both doing the same thing they could
a yeah a lot of work so yeah that as I
was just about to mention yeah a lot of
work involved with that so and again
another step of optimization you have to
optimize DirectX 12 for you know the
exact game engine that you have so I get
it one way to look at it is that the
game developer cares about as Matt walk
has the same care factor for someone
with the to RTX 28 et eyes as it does
with someone with the gtx 750ti
because you've both paid the same amount
of money for their game and their work
yeah so they have real no interest in
looking after personal money exactly
it's just about making sure that their
game works on a large variety of
hardware and it'll still work on
georgie-poo systems you might not be
able to run it and enjoy cheap you
configure as long as it works the game
developer will be happy yeah it was
always more of an incentive for Nvidia
and then AMD to sell more yeah you
actually they know that I once they've
sold the GPS don't really care that much
how well it works and clearly it doesn't
really matter for most people if they've
got money to burn on to high-end GPUs
they will regardless of seems just for
3dmark school ok next question here do
you think Nvidia is knowingly increasing
the prices saying there is no
competition if yet what's your opinion
about the future market for gamers
Wow okay where do I even begin with this
one well they obviously want to make as
much money as they can per GPU
there's a couple of things I've lost the
question on my phone but anyway I'll
work off it wasn't that complicated
churring isn't it big die it's expensive
to make so if they want to make anywhere
near the same margins they were with
Pascal they've got to charge a lot more
it's that simple unfortunately we're not
getting a lot more performance because a
certain percentage of reasonable size of
that die is for your arty cause and your
tensor cause which we aren't currently
using don't know if we'll be able to use
those but they're there and they're not
really adding a lot of benefit I think
like we said two months ago more than a
month before they were released in
videos just capitalizing on the position
that they're currently in they want to
push rate racing they want to employ
that in their GPUs and if they did that
at a time when AMD's very competitive
they would have to absorb that cost to
remain competitive but there they found
themselves in this position where they
have no competition at the moment
they'll probably have competition next
year so rather than wait next year for
that node trip they thought well we can
do 12 no meters now we can make a big
huge GPU we can charge a ton of money
for it we can push it as being this
amazing ray-tracing thing get get the
gamers to pay for the introduction of
ray tracing and we don't we don't absorb
any of that cost okay next question here
how totally you both you all seem tall
I'm that 6-1 yeah I'm about 511
so 179 180 centimeters yeah yeah a lot
of people joke and say well they say
about me mostly but did Tim and Steve
have legs because we're normally sitting
at the table so but I got up and showed
you the chair before and I was using my
legs didn't enjoy it but I was using
them so we do not to use them yeah we
have legs I just prefer not to use them
so it's that simple okay next question
you ready for it
I am ready go show him we're sleeping on
it in your personal opinion do you
believe the r-tx technology so
ray-tracing
will be widely popular in the next one
to two years or do you believe it will
take longer than this to become
mainstream
you're the RT X fan I wouldn't call
myself a fan for myself when you fart
who's been covering on the channel so
long yeah it will be widely popular the
next one to two years I'd certainly
expect there to be more games but I
wouldn't say they'd be widely popular
and certainly would not be a mainstream
in one to two years the issue is you
know as we've seen it looks like
performance will be absolutely awful
even on the high end cards to n8 when
you enable ray-tracing so you think one
to two years might get you good
performance at the high end and then you
have to add on even more years before
that comes down to Main Street which is
when it might be popular and then on top
of that how many games will integrate
rate racing even when it's mainstream so
when you have all these things adding up
it's kind of like you know one to two
years for it to get good on high hand
another two years to get it into the
mainstream and now that may be two years
for to become widespread in games and
game engines yeah we're looking at a lot
longer than one to two years yep pretty
much nailed that I'd liken it to DirectX
12 implementation basically yeah takes a
long time how long ago it's a long time
ago now that we first heard about
DirectX 12 it was going to revolutionize
games and be amazing so it the adoption
so slow over such a long period that by
the time it actually gets to where it
was promised all those years ago you
don't even notice yeah it's like
watching a tree grow almost it's like a
no to you okay another question other
than graphics cards high in network
cards and the occasional sound card what
our expansion slots even needed for
these days well all the things you just
mentioned
I guess additional expansion slots where
are you usually on a mainstream platform
you get about what three yes are you x
16 slots and a couple of one time slots
which admittedly can support sound cards
and things like that
yeah there's tons of things like well we
have PCI Express capture cards I'm not
saying that that's a common thing but as
streaming and stuff like that becomes
more popular yep capture cards are a
thing store storage is a big thing so
obviously you've got your MDOT twos on
most boards but there are drawbacks to
em two slots on motherboards well first
of all you only have so many of them
but using PCI Express expansion cards
adapter cards you can have better
cooling so you can put an m dot 2 card
on those and they won't be under a
component where they can heat up and
stuff like that so yeah there's other
things you can use for the storage as
well so that's not just that but your
storage would be one thing capture cards
probably stuff that yeah oh it's it's
just that's the whole thing that's a PC
it's the ability to expand and do
whatever it is you want to do if you
need something that's niche you know
yeah you can do it
imagine you didn't have that expansion
slot yeah it'd be every bad so I think
it has helped a lot with your USB and
that's sort of thinking a lot faster
that you can first stuff that doesn't
necessarily need the bandwidth the PCI
you can run a lot of expansion stuff
just over USB but certainly there are
some things that need more that's right
back in the day you didn't have that so
much with you with computers it was the
PCI slots and stuff like that are very
important ok well some pretty
interesting questions there hope you
guys enjoyed our response and you're
looking forward to part 2 which will be
on the channel in a few days time like I
said we'll probably squeeze a pax video
in between because we do have quite a
bit of content we've got to get done
over the weekend period so anyway thank
you for watching like subscribe do all
that good stuff me laughing at and we'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
