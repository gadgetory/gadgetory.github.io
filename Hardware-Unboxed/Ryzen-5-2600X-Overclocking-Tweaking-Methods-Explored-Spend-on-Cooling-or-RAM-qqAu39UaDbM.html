going to explore second gen arising
overclocking a little more closely with
the risin v 2600 exxon their sous our OD
across s7 hero I do plan to do the same
with the horizon 720 700 X but for now
we're going to focus on the cheaper six
core part back when I first reviewed the
horizon 520 600 X I found when using the
old-fashioned multiplier method after
boosting the alcohol frequency that it
was only possible to increase the single
core performance by two to three percent
this overclock pushed all six cores to
4.2 gigahertz and although the maximum
boost clock from a single core is 4.2
gigahertz we still saw a small
performance increase though I suspect
this was down to the fact that no
performance loss was seen when switching
between calls throughout the workload we
did see a slightly better four to five
percent boost for the core heavier
workloads but even that makes it
difficult to justify the overclock which
does require upgraded cooling due to the
increased thermal load and of course
power draw that said there is an
alternative way to overclock the rise in
processes that offers better single core
performance and I Suz put together a
document explaining this method about a
month ago now we found previously that
most of the good quality first gen
rising parts could hit 4 gigahertz but
an all-call 4 Giga hos overclock often
didn't net you any extra performance in
like a threaded workloads and at times
could even reduce performance this is
because EXO fire has the potential to
push processes such as the risin 5 1600
X
horizon 7 1800 X and all the thread
ripper models to four point one to four
point two units for lightly threaded
workloads with the horizon 520 600 X
capable of hitting 4.2 gigahertz and the
horizon 7 2,700 x 4.3 gigahertz
overclocking all cost of four or four
point one gigahertz can unlikely will
reduce performance and as I found 4.2
gigahertz offers very little in the way
of actual performance for life threaded
workloads so rather than lock all course
at a designated frequency or soos and
other board makers are taking advantage
of AMD's extended frequency range or XO
fired version through technology by
pushing it to its limits using precision
boost overdrive now I know hearing words
and acronyms like xf are do get a bit
confusing and you will hear things
- imprecision boost to precision boost
override or overdrive or PBO and then on
top of that you have motherboard makers
such as a soos that have their own
marketing terms a soos has attempted to
somewhat simplify this method of
overclocking but there are still a few
key steps involved first stop is the
performance enhancer which has a few
options available level 1 and level 2
operate within the AMD spec so you want
to ignore those and go straight for
level 3 while avoiding level 4 unless
you're an extreme overclockers using ln2
with the performance enhancer set to
level 3 you want to make sure the core
performance boost is also enabled then I
strongly recommend manually setting the
CPU core voltage as the auto or offset
modes around my 2600 up to crazy high
voltages somewhere between one point
four five and one point five five volts
I found my 2600 X was perfectly stable
at one point four volt and going below
that did cause the system to lock up
using the performance enhancer level
three option finally you can push things
a little further by increasing the base
clock though be aware this will also
overclock your memory using the
synchronous mode which you definitely
want to use this method though is likely
going to be more effective for those
using the rise in 720 700 X and I was
only able to achieve a base clock
overclock of just a single megahertz and
as you might imagine this only had a
very minor impact on performance so I'm
gonna ignore that option for the 2600 X
so for testing we do have a few games to
check out as almost everyone who has
requested this video did ask that I look
into how these various overclocking
methods impact gaming performance in
total there are 5 test configurations
for a baseline we have the horizon 520
600 X unaltered using ddr4 29:33 memory
with these standard XMP settings but
rather than using the Box cooler the
corsair h 150 i pro has been used and
I've used this closed-loop cooler for
all the testing in this video then we
have the horizon 520 600 x with ddr4
3400 memory using the XMP settings and
then the same configuration again but
with the Stiltz timings enabled then we
have the ddr4 3400 configuration with
the Stiltz timings plus a 4.2 G here
it's all core overclock using the
standard multiplier method and finally a
precision boost overdrive overclock
using the performance enhancer level 3
option and again ddr4 3400 memory with
the stilts timings enabled all right you
got a lap let's get to the results
here's a look at the operating
frequencies for the single and
multi-threaded workloads for the various
configurations for these stock core
configurations so before we overclock
the horizon processor using the
different memory configurations we see a
single core frequency of 4.2 gigahertz
with an all core frequency of 4
gigahertz then our 4.2 gigahertz
multiplier overclock resulting in a
fixed 4.2 gigahertz operating clock
speed for both these single and
multi-threaded tests then finally the
precision boost over drive configuration
pushed both the single and all core
workloads to a maximum stable operating
frequency of 4.3 gigahertz it would be
possible to achieve this overclock using
the multiplier method but at idle the
cause wouldn't drop down from 4.3
gigahertz that being said let's check
out the power consumption figures stock
the risin 520 600 push total system
consumption 176 watts and an idle
consume just 56 watts the all core 4.2
gigahertz overclocked push system
consumption 15% higher hitting 203 watts
which isn't that bad that said we will
likely only see a very small increase in
performance based on our previous
benchmarks the idle consumption only
increased by 7% which again isn't bad
especially given all cause our locked at
4.2 gigahertz because the precision
boost overdrive is pushing the 2600 X to
its limits in both these single and
multitrader workloads power consumption
is similar to that of the multiplier
overclock ok so now we can take a look
at the difference these over clocks make
at least in cinema r15 the 2600 X pad
with the ddr4 3400 memory using these
stilts timings produced a single core
score of a hundred and seventy four
points with a multi-threaded score of
thirteen hundred and ninety-two points
manually overclocking the 2600 X using
the multiplier method improved this
single core score by 2% and the
multi-threaded score by 5% so very much
like what we saw in our day 1 review the
precision boost over drive configuration
improved these single and multi-threaded
scores by a further 2% which makes sense
given the CPU operating frequency has
been increased by 2.4 percent so what
kind of impact
have on gaming we're not GPU limited
when testing with fire cry 5 we see a
missed six percent increase in frame
time performance when going from the
ddr4 3400 configuration with the
improved timings to the 4.2 gigahertz or
core overclock the precision boost
overdrive overclock which pushed the
cause 100 megahertz higher scored as an
extra frame on average with no increase
seen for the one percent low result we
see much the same way in testing with
ARMA 3 both overclocking methods yield
similar results making them four to six
percent faster than the stock core
configuration using the tweaked memory
lastly here are some fortnight results
and this title isn't as GPU limited as
the previous two tiles we looked at with
the GTX 10 atti eternity P that said
though the overclocks did only provide
three to four percent more performance
by far the biggest gain seen here can be
found when tightening up the sub memory
timings this was only a brief
exploration video but I think we covered
everything we needed to with the risin
520 600 X the general consensus on
launch days seemed to be that
overclocked in the EX models wasn't
worth the added power draw heat and of
course investment and while that
certainly seems to be the case with the
2600 X the horizon 720 700 X should be a
bit different as it has a higher single
core operating frequency and we're
missing out on that when using these
simple multiplier method so that's
something I certainly want to look into
shortly but for Rison 520 600 X owners
there really is little to be gained by
overclocking especially if you fine-tune
those memory timings which you really
should a step one for second gen Rison
owners and I suppose even first
generalize and owners really is to lock
down those memory timings and we saw
we're not limited by the GPU gamers
stand to gain around 10 percent more
performance just by tightening those sub
timings so rather than invest money in a
fancy closed-loop cooler invested in
some Samsung B die memory and look up
how to fine-tune that stuff we do have a
video on that so go check that out and
that is going to do it for this one if
