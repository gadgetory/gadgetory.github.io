hands the geforce gtx 1070 box and msi
gaming xbox and it just occurred to me
that this product is well over a year
old now so in graphics card years it's
fair to say it's getting on a bit
still for anyone that's been looking to
build a capable yet sensible 1440p game
eerie the 1070 really has been the go-to
part for the last year or so and even
the recent arrival of Vega 56 well that
didn't really change that
however as good as it is there is a
problem with the gtx 1070 and for a
while i haven't been out to put my
finger on it but it's just it's lacking
a little something looking at this
beautiful msi gtx 10:17 gaming xbox it
I'll admit it does look pretty complete
so you're probably sitting there
thinking Steve what are you going on
about actually probably just sitting
there thinking I've read the title Steve
stop messing around and just show us the
gtx 1070 TI fine I'll do that spoil all
the fun let's get the 1070 ti out here
are you happy I've got this dragon as
well MSI dragon anyway actually I'm
pretty happy let's check this out all
right Zoe you can have you can have the
dragon back now actually first I should
just say before you go and grab the
popcorn in anticipation of a 30 game
benchmark just know this is just an
unboxing video that's all we can do at
this point so take out of the box and
have a look and for those of you
wondering you will have to wait till
this time next week before you can see
any gtx 1070 TI benchmarks and in my
case it will be msi 1070 TI gaming
benchmarks
so once again we have the Twin Frozr six
cooler pair of talks 2.0 fans it's a
very familiar looking graphics card so
that's the unboxing portion of this
video complete that was pretty quick and
simple obviously I can show you I'll
give you a good look at the card we'll
throw some b-roll up in a moment and
have a good look over it
and also also do a teardown and you know
have a look at that naked PCB you see
what's under there and of course have a
good look at the cooler itself as well
well you guys have it a quick unboxing
and teardown of the msi gtx 1070 TI
graphics card quick note I did test
thermal performance before pulling this
card apart so that's done but what I
haven't done is a heap of gaming
benchmarks so yeah time to do that I
have pretty much a week from now to get
you guys a review and a big benchmark
session done so that's pretty much what
I'm going to be doing hopefully I can
squeeze some more content in between now
and then but I'm very excited to show
you guys what this thing can do this
time next week well that's gonna do it
for this one I'm your host Steve see you
again next time guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
