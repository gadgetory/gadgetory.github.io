part 2 of the July QA I think we had
part one go out yesterday so you should
probably go back onto the channel and
check that one out if you haven't
already but we'll be answering your ton
more questions in this one so let's get
straight to it okay this next question
I'm just skimming through it's quite a
long one actually looks like it's one
for you Tim so you can read the question
so you'll understand it better and yeah
okay so this person is asking you about
the rise in popularity of adaptive sink
motors and I think still people a bit
confused about how important they are
some of people on forums saying gaming
is absolutely impossible or horrible
with this without this technologies and
we know this isn't true however there
isn't any evidence to counter this if
you were using an Nvidia card as most
people do with the free sink Mona
1:44 husband and no adaptive sink
realistically how bad would the
experience be without adaptive sink so
it's interesting question because I have
said in the past that if you're using a
video card with the free sink modest so
long as you're running at frame rates
that are near the sort of 144 Hertz
range that the experience is very
similar whether you have adaptive sync
on or off the only thing adaptive sync
does is it either reduces your
stuttering because you would normally be
running vsync on or alternatively it
reduces your tearing if you have vsync
off so you're less likely to notice
stuttering and tearing at high frame
rates so if you're running it like a lot
a higher fresh panel I like 144 hurt so
if you're running it like a hundred plus
FPS on 144 Hertz in some games it's not
going to be super noticeable either the
stuttering or the tearing that you would
get running with vsync on or off so in
which case then if you're having a video
card running on a free sonic monitor the
difference isn't going to be that much
between that and an AMD card that can
make use of adaptive sync so I
definitely disagree that if you're at
those frame rates that the experience is
horrible without their technology it's
really very similar you might notice
that you might not I think the main
advantage comes if you're running at 70
ish
p.s below to around 40 fps that's the
real golden zone for your adaptive syncs
so if you have an AMD card there it'll
be much smoother and much less tearing
will be noticeable during that sort of
frame rate range so which is what makes
free sync in my opinion a good
technology because it's free so you can
get cheap monitors take advantage on it
on affordable graphics cards whereas I
don't know no correct me if I'm wrong
but I don't really get the point of
g-sync
yeah I mean it makes sense for Nvidia
cards and specifically for high
resolution monitors like fork if you're
game yeah yeah yeah and you're sort of
won't play Ultra in that sort of forty
to sixty zone it'll seem a lot smoother
playing at 40 on g-sync compared to on a
free sync monitor but for a lot of
gamers that are preferring those high
refresh you know high frame rate
experiences honestly if someone that's
used a lot of these Morrison is used
free sync on NVIDIA cards and all that
honestly if I'm playing above 100 FPS
there's very little difference you might
get the occasional game that you know
tearing is really noticeable and then
that's really bad but otherwise just
game with vsync off and you'll be almost
the same sort of experience well that
was a video in itself yep so is there
going to be a huge difference upgrading
from ddr4 2133 to ddr4 41:33 and is it
worth upgrading well not messing around
there that's what I'll always a 194
percent increase yeah that's right
memory frequency huge yeah okay well if
you're able to take advantage of first
of all 2133 is very low like
realistically you're probably buying
2400 probably the slowest memory gonna
buy 2066 so but anyway we even from 2066
2666 to over 4000 that's a huge jump for
gaming you're unlikely to see that
translate into extra frames unless
you're doing like some sort of really
insane high refresh rate gaming for
memory sensitive applications
yes that will be of benefit but you
really have to make sure that you can
use it because I think the cheapest 4000
plus kits or
4133 kits you're looking at around $200
for a 6
you might get I wear a 16 gigabyte kits
of any frequency started about $130 I
think that's like your 2400 stuff that I
mentioned earlier I think it's about as
slow as it goes so that it's really not
worth it for that price increase unless
you have some sort of memory sensitive
application you're running that you'll
notice like a really big boost in
performance and also I mean you have to
take into account that most CPUs can't
support that cut well I want to say most
most of the Intel CPUs probably can on
an unlocked board beat I don't know if
there's a rise and see any I don't don't
think so I mean I view 2nd gen rise and
a 3600 I haven't got any memory that
goes above that so maybe someone can
correct me in the comments if rise and
CPUs go up to 4000 but to my knowledge
they don't so anyway um I've sort of
meandered around a bit here but to
answer your question I don't think it's
worth it you're better off getting I
think 3200 is probably the sweet spot
you're paying about only about 20 or 30
dollars over the base memory for not the
low latency stuff but yeah I'd be I'd be
aiming for ddr4 32 to 3400 that probably
makes the most sense in terms of value
okay next question is it sensible to
purchase a Pascal card right now Tim and
I just talked about this on the patreon
livestream so Tim should be armed with
plenty of information to handle this one
I currently own a classified 980ti and
was waiting for the next gen to arrive
all I've seen so far is nothing but
rumors I hope you saw a joke video
because that was hilarious so if you
stuff I buy a 1080 T I would it be a bad
Buy or should I just wait more do a bit
more waiting yeah so let's be nice I
mean a 980ti it's still a very capable
cards around the same level of a gtx
1070 you'll be playing at 1440p with no
problems and you can get some nice
overclocking performance out of that as
well like a 20% boost also but like I
said my recent video talking about MSRP
cards and the pricing of cards at the
moment it sort of makes sense to wait if
you're in that sort of upper end bracket
at the moment because like your real the
only real option as you say is I've
greens like a 1080i to get a decent
performance improvement and then those
are the cards that are most likely to be
upgraded first video releases their
next-gen cards so
at this point unless you're buying like
a like a ten sixty or those sort of more
entry-level cards it really makes sense
to wait to see what everybody has
because like I said they're gonna
upgrade date those ten seventy ish level
cards and above first so we have no
inside information but there's a good
chance within the next few months you
better get ten a two-hour performance
for a lot less money yeah so we solved
the 980ti become the 1070 in the last
generation if they do anything similar
you'll just be at this point I almost
wasting your money buying a 1080i
through just gonna offer that for like
half the price yeah yeah don't we know
but yes what that did last time if you
were desperate for a graphics card
you're running something that's much
slower than a gtx 980ti then we would
say yeah the prices have come down it's
yeah probably not a terrible time and
you'll get at least a few months of good
gaming that you wouldn't have got
otherwise with a twenty seven hundred
and an rx 584 gigabyte be enough for
gaming and streaming 1080p 60fps pretty
simple one here Steve yeah well I could
answer that with a simple yes I suppose
but well the risin 720 700 perfectly
fine cpu for streaming you wouldn't want
to do I suppose with that configuration
you wouldn't want to do any GPU encoded
streams there's no point so you might as
well get the maximum performance you can
out of the GP or a CPU do the work
because there should be a few threads on
the rise and seven CPU sitting around
doing nothing so stream you'll give them
something to do we've talked about this
Tim and I a bit about different
streaming configurations and stuff and
hopefully next month I'll be tackling
that one cycle that one in a lot more
detail for you yep but in short yep all
right next up would an i7 6700 K be
enough to drive all GPUs coming in the
future get your crystal ball out so a
gtx 1180 TI is an example so 1180 TI and
beyond so Tim what is it I think it will
be enough to drive the next generation
of GPUs especially if you overclock the
CPU but like with all these sort of
things beyond that it's pretty hard to
say it's likely going to be good for
some time to come but you know it has
because it has four cores and eight
threads but you know if you have a 6700
ki certainly hold on to it for now
this time next year they could be some
more attractive options with higher core
cats but I think
for next-gen GPUs you should be fine
with that sort of CPU all right chef
asks I have a 290x with a risin 70 1700
would it make sense to move to an RX 5
ad or Vega 56 when they go on discount
or wait for their next line up I have a
free sink Mona
that's why I'll stay with a and B what
do you reckon now we've answered a few
questions similar to it it's not exactly
like this
okay well basically the r9 290x art from
being are still a very capable graphics
card or GPU it's not really worth
upgrading to the rx 580 because they're
pretty similar in terms of performance
you have to saturate the 4 gigabyte vir
and buffer of the 290x to see the RX 580
pull ahead by any sort of noteworthy
margin so what else we got Vega 56 was
the other one that's a decent step up in
terms of performance from a 2 on e^x not
massive but it's decent I mean it's
similar to how the rx 580 and Vegas
stack up but again I re pretty certain
we're getting those new NVIDIA GPUs in a
few months so yeah I don't know that's a
tough one again it probably someone
asked about the gtx 980ti and i think
this is a similar situation the r9 290x
is still very capable graphics card so
for now I would probably just settle
with tweaking your quality settings and
I'm shooting about he did mention the
free sync monitor sorry I just scrolled
back and saw that so the Nvidia cards
consume won't be of interest cuz you
want to keep your free sync support so
in that case you're going to just have
to wait for AMD to pull their finger I
think it's much I think unless you go
for like a Vega 64 then all of those
other cards they're too expensive for
what they're offering again you probably
wait till next year
yeah you'll be wait until next year to
see what they do then and hopefully they
do something yep exciting
are there any infos on motherboards
support for Intel's 8 core CPU canons ed
370 handle or will Intel come around the
corner with another excuse to make
people upgrade again keep up the good
work guys thanks I keep up the good
questions but yeah thank you and we
talked about this in quite a bit of
depth on our patron livestream so Tim
had some strong opinions on that one but
all it Tim yeah I think like with all
sort of future products you again we
don't really know at the moment but
we do know that they are going to
replace the said 370 with is every night
because Intel's actually leaked their
own documents about it so we kind of
already know all the features we're
still uncertain whether the said 370 or
the through nine and what will be the
support there for eight core CPUs i
think zed 390 will definitely support
eight core and yes I would suspect at
this point that Z 370 won't support
eight core I'm not 100% sure but I think
that's why it's kind of heading him
knowing Intel you know they love to
update their motherboard like that it
would be a shame though if the rest of
the ninth gen CPUs didn't weren't
supported on said 370 at all it seems
like they're basically just eight gen
CPUs with slightly faster clock so if
they're not supported on said 370 that
would be a bit of a mess I reckon a
catastrophic mess let's hope that isn't
the situation okay so neil has asked a
long one here I'm gonna summarize it
briefly but basically it comes down to
will you ever do triple monitor
benchmarks instead of 1080p and 4k
triple Mona builds you know it was a
niche market three to five years ago but
not anymore I'm not sure triple monitor
is more than a niche market I like it
was I think it's fairly similar to three
to five years ago in fact and even I
thought so it's probably even less
popular now that ultra wide motors are a
thing because for example I used to run
a triple motor set up by 310 Islanders
but as soon as those 21:9 1440p moves
became available upgrades to that and I
think the experience is actually better
so for most people I'd recommend using
21:9 over your triple monitor setup I
think back in the days when we're sort
of doing triple monitor stuff you could
quite easily sort of infer your sort of
performance you're gonna get from either
your 1080p or 4k benchmarks like it
won't be exact but for example if you've
got a triple 1080p setup and you're
you're wondering if your GPU can run a
game if you can run it at 4k to run a
triple 10 pixels so yeah basically
pixels are pixels so I think because
it's so nice it's probably not something
we'd be looking at testing too much we'd
stick to the sort of standard
resolutions that people are actually
using but like what I do with 21:9 I
like with what a lot of people do with
triple monitor you should just be
looking at sort of those sort of
inferences that you can make from
and we do provide but I like to Pomona
testing I like triple monitor gaming I
like ultra wide so it's still nice and
good for racing games as you mentioned
that's it I like I'll do enjoy racing
games I don't have too much time playing
but I've played a bit of F 1 2017 great
game enjoy that
as for the peripherals the wheels and
that I know if we're sort of have these
sort of expertise to do those kind of
reviews justice like I said I enjoy
playing around with them but yeah I
don't feel comfortable sort of giving
people buying advice on that kind of
hardware we'd have to you know spend a
lot of time and energy and investment I
think to do that justice so might not be
something you'll see from us but you
never know I'm sure there's enthusiasts
racing people out there that will tell
you which ones of those are the best
absolutely okay so I have Rison 526
hundred and a be 350 motherboard should
I upgrade to X 470 or stick with my B
350 or maybe you have another advice
would that be a B 450 board which is
pretty much as far as I can tell the be
350 board yeah
to answer your question not really I
don't think there's much point less
there's feature missing on your be 350
board maybe you bought a really low end
be 350 board it doesn't have some sort
of features there on the X 470 boards I
can't really think of any other reason
to recommend it performance wise you
shouldn't be out you shouldn't be
missing out on anything there again
unless it's a really entry-level be 350
board and perhaps you're doing some sort
of overclocking that it's not allowing
you to max out your CPU but again he has
a rise in 520 600 that would be more of
a problem I think on the rise and 7 2
CPUs that's true overclocking on B 350
with rise in fire I think it's been fine
for most people yeah look I've got
nothing for I can't think of any reason
why you should be apart from the fact
like said if there's some sort of
feature you're missing on the be 350
board yeah ok so next question is I was
wondering since AMD made obviously a
great deal about rise in our laptops how
come that we barely seen notebooks in
any shape or form on the market can be
related to jus be some marketing
practices enacted by Intel over the
years or is it just a segment on the
market that simply lost traction yeah
it's it's hard to say what what sort of
happened with rising laptops there's
been a few that have been announced but
it seems like they've either been
pretty slow to hit the market or they're
just not available in certain
territories and there's not a lot of
options I'm not necessarily sure whether
it's you know dubious marketing
practices by Intel it's just rising in
laptops is a very new segment that's
been utterly dominated by Intel for the
best part of a decade they've been
absent for too long yeah and especially
with pre-built systems that you know a
company like Dell or HP whoever is
making there tend to be just stick with
what they know especially because you
know they've often designed motherboards
that they use for generations they
designed cooling solutions that are
appropriate so I think it's just a
situation where you know on the desktop
front people can do whatever they want
they can just buy whatever processor
that's good was on laptops is still just
you know trying to gain a bit of
adoption there and they still trying to
trying to break into the mic so
hopefully we see more laptops and some
of them are some laptops that exist
actually reach the market I think by
this time next year it'll be much
different yeah I think once we start to
get to the laptop the new laptop season
which is towards the end of the year
usually when Intel releases their new
processes and hopefully we'll have a bit
more competition between your Intel
offerings and rise and offerings in the
same sort of form factors that'll be
really cool serious question time can
you do a back flip on camera
well sure answer that one not if you
want to say any benchmarks next week hey
Steve which AIO would you recommend for
a thread Ripper CPU 1950 X or do be best
use a custom loop cooling solution best
air cooling for overclocking usage in
productivity workloads so what do you
use okay will custom loop cooling so
that's I assume he means open-loop yeah
I think so so I mean that's hugely
expensive totally different chalk and
cheese so if you'll want an open-loop
system you can't really compare that
with air but for thread grip 9050 X is
overkill anyway because they don't
overclock that well they're not bad so I
have the nm ax lick tech Lea tech tech
tech so I've got that it's the tr4
version naturally and I have the 280
millimeter version so that's only one
liquid cooler and it also comes in 240
millimeter and
sixty millimeter versions so that that's
really good I love that it's got a huge
block on it so that's made obviously for
the tr4 socket also made for the tr4
socket is the inoculate air cooler so
they have some really good air coolers
I've also tested some of those I think
in terms of performance the only one
liquid cooler and the NOx where pools
are very similar I'm not sure which
one's better there I think maybe the
only one liquid cool is a smidgen better
not sure it's probably probably doesn't
justify the price increase but I really
like it anyway the lick tech okay some
business ideas here any collaboration
ideas with Dollar Shave Club I think you
go has a perfect for it what is he
trying to say stiff mg and is already
taking advantage of his fabulous facial
hair structure and making some profit to
support the channel and they doing
Dollar Shave Club at Davis next I don't
know who knows I've missed it if they
are well yeah sure I don't sign us up
yeah sounds like fun to us and a bit of
money
oh good both good okay so IB slices
asked a really good question in a
discord chat for our patrons he says Bob
she says when you guys bench it's always
in a controlled setup in reality most of
us have many apps running and sometimes
things like a plex server in the
background how much of a performance it
can that cause and what apps maybe the
worse that affect the CPU or GPU so I
think a lot of the time when you're sort
of gaming in particular you're not
really utilizing things like your CP
your memory at a hundred percent so
running things like you know a plex
server can be intensive if it's doing
its encoding stuff but other things like
your Chrome or discord or Chad apps or
even just running Steam and that sort of
thing has very little performance impact
what you're doing in crack yeah yeah for
the most part yeah but I think you
wanted to do some testing on this some
sort of price to bed once and for all
well I don't think I'm that naive but
I'll give it a go I would like to do
some testing on it it's difficult game
as Nexis had a shot at it and basically
concluded that it's too inaccurate which
yeah makes sense I think at least
putting to bed like how much Chrome 50
chrome tabs open how much impact that
does have which should be nothing if
you're watching a 4k YouTube video
introduces some CPU overhead so yeah
it's an interesting thing to look into
so that's something we'll do in a future
video
and I always implies is it super slicer
IB slice it's a male so sorry mate not
Sal Kagan no not so okay so Sal asks
what would the specs of the first PC you
guys ever built and how long ago was it
this must be freaking ancient stuff for
you why are these always come up well
I've said it before on these QA so but
Sal is a relatively new and relentless
member it was a seller on well my
personal computer ants bought computers
I use as a Kip at my first ever computer
that I built was an Intel Celeron 300 a
overclocked it to 450 475
something like that that's that
megahertz for you kids watching single
core stuff that was on an eye open
motherboard maybe we had this alien
stuff you have to relive all this
everyone can we just cut that from the
previous QA
I saw sudden I opened motherboard I had
a 16 megabyte voodoo banshee AGP can't
remember the storage it was a beige case
yeah yeah I had it first PC I built was
like an Intel Celeron II 2100 series I
think that's core to Judaism Core 2 Duo
days yeah that sort of days that I put
in a Radeon HD 4850 I think that was the
first as the first PC I built at the
obviously again my parents a I remember
reviewing that not that long ago yeah I
was more than 10 years ago to be fair
but yeah I'd some pcs of an upgraded
before then that would sort of more that
my parents bought but that was the first
one I'd built by myself I think I'd like
maybe 2 or 4 gig of ram in there and man
I was so proud of myself when that thing
was off and firing and playing games
like for three it was I was right I was
on Windows 98 playing command called her
gold or something like that I think
not yet yeah Jessica Amy wasn't that far
after us barely born well what operating
system was on yours
it could have been Vista yep and that's
it for this month's Q&amp;amp;A video we've got
two videos that already filled with
questions I hope you guys enjoyed some
of our responses over the past couple of
videos as always don't forget to
subscribe we do these every month
usually if we can be bothered to get
around to it we do it every month come
on well alright fair enough we do them
every month so subscribe for that and I
guess we'll catch you in the next one so
