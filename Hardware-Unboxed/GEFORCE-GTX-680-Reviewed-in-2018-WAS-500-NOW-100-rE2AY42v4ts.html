episode of throwback Thursday yep that's
what I'm calling it now when I look at
older PC hardware I'm sure you all think
it's a cool name and very original so
let's just swiftly move along and talk
about today's video sponsor today's
video is brought to you by Dyson and
their new range of cordless and just
kidding guys
but seriously Dyson let's talk right so
today we're revisiting an old friend
2012's geforce gtx 680 released roughly
this time six years ago it was in
video's latest and greatest offering at
the time replacing the then 14 month old
GTX 580 another GPU from the green team
that we've recently revisited before we
get to the gaming benchmarks so let's
quickly recap the GTX 680 specs and a
bit of history about the architecture
that's based upon for those of you not
interested in a trip down memory lane
I'll throw up some pretty footage of the
graphics card in question so enjoy that
based on the Kepler architecture the GPU
is codenamed GK 104 it marketing videos
transition to the 28 nanometer process
and allowed for a massive 3.5 billion
transistors to be crammed into a tiny
294 millimeter squared die Nvidia also
managed to squeeze in what was at the
time a massive 1536 CUDA cores three
times that of the GTX 580 not only that
but the cores were clocked 30% higher
and yet overall the GPU consumed less
power the focus for Kepler was on
efficiency basically Nvidia broke down
their previous Fermi architecture right
down to the core and then rebuilt it to
improve power consumption and the die
size the result was the world's fastest
gaming graphics solution at least when
it was first released AMD actually beat
Nvidia to the punch three months earlier
and alright how times have changed
anyway although the GTX 680 was 4%
cheaper at launch and offered 7% more
performance in my tests it did suffer
from poor availability for quite a few
months after release so I guess some
things don't change
back then AMD did do a good job of
keeping nvidia on its toes for example a
Radeon HD 4000 series spurred a war that
saw the GTX 280 5000 series enjoyed a
complete lack of competition for half a
year before the GTX 400 cars arrived and
as I said in 2012
AMD was almost three months ahead with
the HD 7970 being they were slightly
behind it was very important for Nvidia
to come out guns blazing and to a
certain extent that's precisely what
they did the GTX 680 was without a
question the fastest single GPU graphics
card and money could buy not only was it
faster than HD 7970
but it was also more efficient quieter
and cheaper when it was first released
it actually be quite interesting to see
how they compare today this might be a
good idea for next week's throwback
Thursday for now though I'm keen to see
how the GTX 680 stacks up against more
modern GPUs in modern games representing
the old vintage GPU as the game wood
phantom model sporting a more standard 2
gigabyte variant buffer for the time
I've recently purchased a 4 gigabyte
model and that should arrive in the next
week or two at which point I do plan to
do a 2 gigabyte vs. 4 gigabyte gtx 680
comparison in modern titles and that
might also make for an interesting video
all testing has been conducted on our
corsair GPU test rig which comprises of
a core i7 87 or okay clocked at 5 gig
'it's with 32 gigabytes of vengence ddr4
3,200 memory so how does the gtx 680
stack up today let's go find out first
up we have battlefield 1 and please note
while these results were recorded using
the ultra quality preset I have retested
and shown actual gameplay footage with
the medium quality settings and you'll
see that later in the video for now you
can see that under these conditions the
GTX 680 is actually slower than the
Radeon HD 7950 though what's a whopping
81 percent faster than the GTX 580 no
doubt the slightly larger memory buffer
is helping to improve things here this
time when testing with Dawn of War 3 the
GTX 680 managed to roughly match the HD
7950 and this meant as a result it was
once again a much faster than the GTX
580 though
percent low result was also respectable
and clearly two gigabytes is the minimum
frame buffer size you can get away with
in this title when using the medium
quality preset so I suppose no real
surprises there interestingly the GTX
680 does very well in dirt for taking
out top spot with an impressive 116 FPS
on average using the medium quality
settings this meant on average it was
12% faster than the HD 7950 and 81% fast
and the GTX 580 moving on to firaon away
again see very strong performance from
the GTX 680 as it again takes out the
top spot on our graph here here it was
25% faster than the HD 7950 and 60% fast
in the GTX 580 performance in Ghost
Recon wildlands was decent as the GTX
680 roughly matched the HD 7950 and was
more than twice as fast as the GTX 580
although we're only using the low
quality things the game is still very
heavy on video RAM usage almost maxing
out the two Gilbert frame buffer on the
GTX 680 using the medium quality
settings in Mass Effect Andromeda
performance was still very solid as the
GTX 680 allowed for 70 FPS on average
though it was slow in the GTX 1050 Ti
only slightly fast in the HD 7950 moving
on to prey using the higher quality
preset you really need a 4 gigabyte
frame buffer in this title and with the
gtx 680 almost all the textures were
actually missing our leaving us with
just blurry surfaces still overall the
performance was good the game did run
smooth despite the fact that we were
missing some textures and well while it
did play ok it didn't look particularly
nice then finally we have Resident Evil
7 and here the GTX 680 came in just
behind the GTX 1050 Ti on HD 7950 using
the medium quality preset and managed to
average 98 FPS and this minute was 44%
fast in the GTX 580 so overall the GTX
680 seems to deliver a similar
experience to the other GTX 1052 I but
let's take a closer look at that ok so
here's a breakdown of the 8 games we
just looked at not average we can see
that the GTX 680 is basically matching
the gtx 1050 Ti I'm a little surprised
by this because last time I compared
them the 1050 TI came out on top that
said I did only check out 5 games and it
was a very
close comparison and the GTX 680 was
faster only one of the games that
overlaps with this test and that game
was Battlefield 1 so some interesting
results for sure but before I wrap
things up let's quickly look at some
gameplay footage first up I played a few
rounds of Rainbow six siege and found I
averaged the GTX 680 was good for over
100 FPS when using the medium quality
settings it's a DP the frame time
performance was also excellent enabling
smooth gameplay that allowed even a
novice like me to get a few decent shots
in overall a great experience and it's
fair to say you could have a lot of fun
in this title with the gtx 680 the
experience in battlefield 1 with the
medium quality preset was very solid at
times the game was very smooth and
playable at over 50 FPS on average there
are other times there was noticeable
framerate lag as the frame sort of
dipped into the low 40s overall though
it was very playable and an enjoyable
experience under these conditions I
found a very similar experience when
playing battlefront 2 but this time
using the higher quality settings here
the frame rates were excellent Lang for
a smooth and certainly very playable
experience with the higher quality
settings the game also looked great and
I was impressed with an average of just
over 60 fps moving on we have fortnight
and this title plays very well on pretty
much anything
using the high quality preset the GTX
680 averaged just over 70 FPS and after
10 minutes of gameplay remained over 50
fps at all times and the frame time data
was also very solid like fortnight
overwatch is a tile that you can play on
pretty much anything even with the ultra
quality settings and here the GTX 680
allowed for an average of almost 90 FPS
while framerate stayed above 50 FPS at
all times
and again the frame time data was also
very good then wrapping things up we
have player knowns battlegrounds and it
actually ran pretty well I saw an
average of 66 FPS with a minimum of 59
fps using the medium quality settings
and overall it was a smooth and very
playable experience oh and I almost
forgot one last thing
power consumption here we see that the
GTX 680 reduced the total system
consumption by almost 20% when compared
to the GTX 580 and given how much faster
it was this is a significant step
forward in terms of performance per watt
that said it's still push system
consumption 26% higher than that of the
Radeon HD 7950 a little over 60% higher
when compared to the GTX 1052 I so
certainly not great by today's standards
but not a terrible result overall so
that covers pretty much everything in
terms of performance with the exception
of overclocking but those results will
vary a bit from card to card the factory
overclocked model that I have wasn't
really behaving itself when overclocked
and I didn't really have a heap of time
to mess around with it but then I did go
back and have a look at my original
review published at text spot all those
years ago and it turns out that this
particular card here is a pretty rubbish
overclocker so that's probably what I
was running into it I can only get about
67 more megahertz out of the core over
the factory overclock so not
particularly great there are models that
will go much higher than that I do have
a four gigabyte model in the mail so
check that out when it arrives and see
if it's willing to play ball anyway in
terms of extra performance you're
probably looking anywhere from 5 to 15%
more frames depending on how well the
card overclocks this model here was only
about 5% so kind of not really worth the
time and effort invested anyway for
those of you not interested in
overclocking the good news is that a
typical factory overclocked model such
as the gamer version that I used that
should be able to match a factory
overclocked gtx 1050 TI in most titles
as you just saw overall it was a single
frame slower on average and two frames
slower for the 1% lower result it was
also 8 percent faster than the HD 7950
and 13 percent faster than the vanilla
gtx 1050 it also who absolutely blitzed
to the older GTX 580 by a mammoth 65
percent margin that 1536 megabyte frame
buffer of the GTX 580 is just too
limited for many of today's modern
titles and we're even seeing issues with
two gigabytes now it'll be interesting
to see just how the four gigabyte
version of the gtx 680 compares when I
get my hands on it next week
for now though 1050 TI light performance
is very acceptable and you can certainly
enjoy yourself for the latest and
greatest titles at 1080p using
respectable quality settings for those
poor souls who have forgotten how much a
GTX 1052 I should cost I went and looked
it up a hundred and thirty-nine dollars
u.s. is the actual
MSRP I know that doesn't sound right but
apparently it is today though if you got
one for $200 u.s. you'd actually be
doing quite well as absurd as that
sounds
so can you save some money and get a gtx
680 secondhand well sure you can if
you're lucky jumping over to ebay comm
we see that so far this month in the
u.s. the cheapest gtx 680 sale ended at
just over $100 and the average selling
price of the 16 cards sold so far this
month is a hundred and sixty dollars
u.s. so you'd probably want to do better
than 160 dollars u.s. to be honest
that's only a 27% saving for these
secondhand graphics card i'd personally
set my price cap and around a hundred
and twenty dollars us for a gtx 680 and
if you can get a four gigabyte model
well obviously do so but honestly your
chances of snagging your gtx 680 today
for less than $100 u.s. is well
basically zero so be realistic with your
expectations remember apart from being
old and probably quite well used the gtx
680 also chugs quite a lot more power
than a gtx 1050 TI so that means that
the more modern 1052 i will likely run
much cooler quieter and it won't ravage
your power supply like at FX 95 90
trying to keep up with those fancy new
AP use the smaller vm buffer can also be
an issue at times unless you manage to
get your hands on a 4 gigabyte gtx 680
which isn't necessarily that easy to do
and that's going to do it for this one
