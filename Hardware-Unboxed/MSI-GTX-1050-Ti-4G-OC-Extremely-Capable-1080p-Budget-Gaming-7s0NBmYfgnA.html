benchmarking lab this week to help him
out the 10:50 launch and I'm pretty
excited to see what end videos new
entry-level GPUs have to offer us you
may have noticed what I have here
isn't the 1050 but rather MSI's gaming Z
graphics card it's the 1080 model and a
very very powerful very efficient
graphics card a lot of gamers would love
to have one of these in their rig but
not everyone does because they cost
several hundred US dollars and even if
you can afford one not everyone's going
to justify spending that kind of money
just to play games I mean that is a lot
of money so that's why both AMD and
NVIDIA have the entry-level guys
currently at the moment that probably
the best entry-level card is AMD's rx
460 and 110 for the 2gig model it's
extremely good value it's better than
the 950 or the 750 Ti from last
generation they're both still great
graphics cards but the newer rx 460 just
has a bit more to offer at the price and
today Nvidia will be finally taking it
to AMD with their Pascal 1050 Ti so
let's take a look at it it's a nice
little very little card it's the first
thing that jumps out it was actually
have tiny the graphics card is and I'll
just get that out of the way actually
one of the reasons why I have this thing
on hand just to show you just how small
the 1052 eye really is I mean if that
gives you some idea there are the two
cards side-by-side this little fella it
is a hundred and seventy seven
millimeters long total length that is
the PCB is just 150 millimeters long so
a compact card overall it's also very
very light which probably won't surprise
many of you Before we jump to the
benchmarks we'll check out your game
performance thermals power consumption
all that good stuff be sure to check out
Matt's review on the vanilla card here
or rather pulley oops it's probably more
up here get that and once you've checked
that out come back and we'll get on with
this thing all right now that we've
taken a quick look at MSI's gtx 1050 TI
let's rip off that cooler to get a
better look at the PCB and while we're
at it we might even take a peek at that
cheeky little heatsink the entire card
weighs just 329 grams which is almost
three times less than most mid-range to
high-end graphics cards including the
fan plastic shroud and tiny aluminium
heatsink the cooler totals 193 grams the
heatsink measures just 95 millimeters
long 90 millimeters tall and 18
millimeters thick it also tips the
scales just 118 grams I've seen tablets
with bigger heat sinks like the standard
1050 the ti model doesn't require an
external 6 pin PCI Express connector and
MSI hasn't felt the need to include one
which I quite like
they have also stuck with a basic 3+1
power phase design though this should be
more than enough to keep the 75 watt TDP
card happy unlike the standard 1050 the
ti model uses the full GP 107 silicon
and this means 12 working SM units allow
you to pack 20% more criticals for a
grand total of 768 there are also 48 TM
use and 3200 PS Nvidia set the default
clock specifications at 1290 megahertz
for the base clock and 1392 megahertz
for the boost clock MSI is beefed up
these frequencies are tab by pushing the
base to thirteen hundred and forty-one
megahertz
resulting in a boost frequency of
fourteen hundred and fifty-five
megahertz
this is a five percent overclock so we
aren't expecting any huge improvements
here all 1050 TI cars will come fitted
with four gigabytes of gddr5 memory
clocked at 1750 megahertz and msi hasn't
tinkered with the operating frequency
here armed with what seems like a rather
inadequate 128-bit wide memory bus the
1052 eye grubs data from the memory at a
rate of one hundred and twelve gigabytes
per second this is the same memory
bandwidth available to the RX 460 which
also boasts a 128-bit wide memory bus
getting back to the MSI card we find at
the i/o end there's a DisplayPort 1.4
HDMI 2.0 and
link DVI port these outputs should have
most users well covered and all three
can be used simultaneously if need be
alright so at this point we've pretty
much covered all the important stuff
before jumping in the benchmarks a few
quick notes on the testing many of you
have requested that we use our skylake
core i3 test machine for this review
rather than the beefy core i7 rig this
is something we've done the past four
sub hundred alla graphics card reviews
and again we feel it makes the most
sense here the latest AMD and NVIDIA
drivers were use for testing and while
the results for other cards such as the
rx 460 have been carried over from
previous tests we did go through the
results with updated drivers and made
changes where need be for the most part
though things stayed much the same okay
finally the moment you guys have all
been waiting for the benchmarks let's
get to it where else would we start but
battlefield one yes we did test using
DirectX 11 but know we aren't trying to
make Nvidia look good here so please put
those pitchforks down in our opinion the
DirectX 12 implementation is a little
too buggy at the moment and both AMD and
NVIDIA GPU suffer from regular dips in
performance so this is why we're
sticking with DirectX 11 for now the
game is extremely well optimized using
DirectX 11 and runs like a treat and
hardware from both teams the GTX 10:50
managed to edge out the 950 which isn't
bad but we did see much more impressive
performance from the ti model the 18%
boost in performance took the average
frame rate from 49 frames per second 258
frames a second this meant that 1052 I
was five percent faster than 960 and not
a great deal slower than the r9 380
quite an impressive result then for
those of you who simply couldn't forgive
us for testing battlefield one using the
DirectX 11 API maybe you can forgive us
because we've included Deus Ex mankind
divided here the 1052 I was 15% faster
than the vanilla 1050 but more
importantly matched the rx for 64 gig
card even with the medium quality
settings enabled performance he wasn't
exactly stellar and a massive step
forward can be seen when moving to the
r9 380 doom with Vulcan yet we're trying
to keep everyone happy here doing really
loath 2 gigabyte graphics cards and for
that reason the standard 1050 struggles
a little with the minimums that said we
are gaming at tallie p with the game
virtually maxed out so a 47 FPS minimum
still very acceptable still this makes
the 1052 eyes 73 FPS minimum even more
impressive and despite using Vulcan it
was still able to best to the rx for 64
gig card so a big win for Nvidia here in
Gears of War for the 1052 I might have
only been 11 percent faster an average
one compared to the base model 1050 but
that was enough of a boost to reach 60
FPS on average it also meant that the ti
was 25% faster than the rx 460 that said
it was still 7% slower than the GTX 960
and 12% slower than the r9 380 even I
was wondering why we bothered testing
mafia 3 really the only reason we
include this game because well let's be
honest the optimization is shocking is
the fact that it is a newly released
title and it is quite a bit of fun to
play using the low preset I know right
low freakin Hal we have read just 43
frames a second with the 1050 Ti this
placed on par with the r9 380 X and as
such meant that it was 30% faster than
the rx 460 Mirror's Edge catalyst is a
great quality game and here the 1050 - I
was 12% faster than the standard 1050
rendering 66 FPS on average also meant
the TI was 32% fast in the RX 460 and
just 4% slower than the r9 380
interestingly it was also 6% faster than
the GTX 960 I realize these new GPUs
aren't going to have any issues with
overwatch that said as a super
competitive first-person shooter game is
crave high frame rates in this title so
being able to push well over 60 FPS
using the ultra quality settings at
1080p is a nice luxury the 1050 - I
certainly deliver T averaging 113 frames
per second and never dipping below 99
FPS
this made at 55% faster than the rx for
60 full gig card finally before getting
the overclocking power consumption and
temps we're going to take a quick look
at the frame rate performance in quantum
break this is another controversial
title we've tested with since we're
using the steam version which limits us
to DirectX 11 testing here the 1050 - I
have rige 75 frames a second using the
medium quality preset and this was
obviously very playable shockingly
though this meant that the 1050 - I was
60% faster than the rx 460 as far as I
can tell this is a bit like the
battlefield 1 situation the AMD graphics
card sliver much the same performance
you
DirectX 11 with the Steam version as
they do with DirectX 12 in the Windows
Store version meanwhile the geforce
cards pretty much suck using DirectX 12
but they're much stronger using steams
DirectX 11 version using MSI Afterburner
we overclocked the core to a base
frequency of fifteen hundred and
fifty-two megahertz which gave us a
boost clock of sixteen hundred and
sixty-five megahertz
the memory went from 750 megahertz to
1927 megahertz this saw the 1050 TR
operating it between 1860 to 1900
megahertz when gaming as a result we saw
a mile six percent performance gain in
Gears of War for taking the average
frame rate from 60fps to 64 fps so not
an earth-shattering result here but a
free performance bump all the same
testing with battlefield 1 we saw a
better 8 percent performance gain from
overclock and that was enough to match
the 960 so not a bad result here then
I've been very keen to check out the
power consumption figures and the 1050
Ti doesn't disappoint here our entire
core i3 rig consume just 118 watts when
paired with the 1050 Ti and that's
gaming consumption folks so basically
you're looking at similar power
consumption to the already efficient gtx
750ti the 1050 doesn't make the rx 460
look bad but then again it was
consistently faster and did allow the
system consume 20% less power the msi
1054 gig OC features a heatsink with
less surface area than my smartphone
even though it is only tasked with
keeping a 75 watt TDP rated GPU cool
it's still very small nevertheless
operating temperatures were kept in
check and they never exceeded 72 degrees
in our gaming tests more importantly it
was barely audible and certainly
couldn't be heard over existing case
fans when overclock temperatures only
increased by a few degrees and the fan
only spun up ever so slightly right so
for now we're considering this is more
of a preview because the big 20 plus
game performance breakdown is still to
come
soon we'll be comparing the 10 52 gig
head-to-head against the rx 462 gig and
then of course the 1050 TI 4 gig versus
the RX 4 64 gig and I might even sneak
in the RX 417 of that comparison because
I think that makes sense as well for now
let's take a look at the cost per frame
data based on the small sample of games
just tested fully aware that some of the
Gamze didn't come out named deez favor
well in fact quite the opposite was true
this won't be our final conclusion that
said the new rx 470 which we have priced
at the 170 dollar MSRP comes out at a
rather impressive $1 and 88 cents per
frame making it one of the better value
options here the GTX 1063 also looks
quite good as well the GTX 1050 Ti is on
par with the three gig 1060 so that's
good news especially since it seems to
wipe the floor with a m-- DS rx 460
range even with the updated price cuts
taken into account we're still for AMD
the vanilla 1050 comes in at a much
lower cost per frame while delivering
more frames overall for those of you who
don't find the scatterplot that easy to
digest we have hacked together a bar
graph that tries to illustrate the
situation in more simplified manner this
isn't really the correct way to show you
this data but we are aware quite a few
of you prefer this method anyway you can
plainly see that the RX 460 Series cost
more per frame while delivering less
frames overall as for Emma's eyes cute
little 1050 TI OC graphics card we
rather like it the fact that it can
still be overclocked to squeeze out say
6 to 8% more performance we have the
need for an external power connector is
just awesome it also ran a very
reasonable temperatures and generated
very little noise for those are rocking
older systems with slightly dodgy power
supplies this new graphics card might be
the answer alright guys that's all from
me on this one I hope you really enjoyed
this review and please be sure to keep
an eye on those upcoming hair day
comparisons they ought to be good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
