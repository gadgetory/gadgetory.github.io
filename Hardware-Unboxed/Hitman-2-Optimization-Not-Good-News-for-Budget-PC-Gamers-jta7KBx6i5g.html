looking at hitman 2 on PC once again
following on from Steve's video covering
GPU performance on Sunday in this video
as was the case with our previous game
optimization videos I'll be covering
every graphics settings found in hitman
2 showing you how each setting stacks up
visually as well as how each setting
impacts performance this will give you
guys a good idea of what settings you
should be using when playing the game in
terms of graphics settings there's well
there's not really a lot to play with
here in hitman 2 when the game launched
there were just 5 tweakable settings
plus the usual sliders for super
sampling and resolution and then with
the launch of a patch yesterday IO
Interactive added in a sixth setting for
tweaking simulation quality as Steve
showed in his GPU benchmark the game is
pretty well optimized if you're using
ultra settings with cars like the GTX
970 sufficing for 1080p 60fps gameplay
it also looks great at least in my
opinion when you're playing on these
settings especially in terms of
environment density lighting quality and
some of the reflection effects at the
same time though the limited selection
of graphics options may make it
difficult for those with entry-level
systems to get the game running well
this is something I'll talk about after
we go through all the settings because a
game might be nice and optimized using
the ultra settings but if there's not
much room in terms of scaling there is
still going to be gamers that will
suffer in any case all testing you see
in this video was conducted with a range
of high-end and mid-range cuts from both
AMD and NVIDIA so the results you see
here should apply to most gamers though
on that as we go where performance may
differ for those with lower end hardware
also I did test using my core i7 8700 K
test system overclocked to 4.9 gigahertz
with 16 gigabytes of Corsair Vengeance
ddr4 memory and this game is reasonably
demanding on the CPU so those with
weaker processes may need to turn down a
few things and again I'll talk about
those specific settings that said at
least for our testing we were entirely
GPU bound all footage in this video was
captured at 4k using a GeForce r-tx 2080
so for the best quality we recommend
watching the video using you
oops 4k settings sometimes it's hard to
spot the differences if you aren't
watching above 1080p on YouTube we also
have provided a source quality download
for our patreon links to that in the
description final few notes all the
benchmark data was collected using a
single benchmark run so the footage you
see for the visual comparisons doesn't
always correspond directly to the
performance data however I tested using
the initial cut scene for the Miami main
story mission this real-time rendered
cutscene moves through a lot of
locations quickly and highlights most of
the game's graphical effects in a short
period of time so it was ideal for this
sort of testing perhaps the strangest
thing about hitman two's graphical
options is a lack of presets you simply
have these six graphics options and it's
left up to you to choose which setting
you want that made my job a bit easier
for this video but still it might have
been nice to include some presets for
everyday uses that might not be as
familiar with settings tweaks anyway
we'll start here with the level of
detail setting which controls the
quality of models model draw distance
foliage draw distance and a number of
other related elements in a lot of
scenes the difference between the four
modes is subtle you really need to step
into a larger area to see the effects of
draw distance changes in action
throughout most of the levels are tested
there's not a huge difference between
Ultra and high especially in indoor
areas with medium model quality starts
to fall away and draw distance for
elements like grass moves closer to the
camera while with the low setting these
aspects really fall away and the lack of
grass density makes the ground look flat
in some areas when looking at
performance you'll gain about 2% moving
from Ultra to high which I think for
most users is going to be a good
trade-off it's a small improvement but
the visual quality difference is barely
noticeable for those on more constraint
systems I dropped to the medium setting
here you'll pick up 6% to performance
compared to ultra-low does give a
sizeable boost to 1% lower performance
but considering the quality drop and the
lack of an improvement to average frame
rates it's not a setting I'd recommend
texture quality is a straightforward
setting in most games and that's no
exception with hitman 2 the texture work
in this game is excellent across most
elements especially at 4k and with the
high setting you're getting the sharpest
textures at this resolution dropping to
normal only provides a small
in texture clarity most noticeable on
ground textures and I suspect the
difference would be hard to spot when
playing on a 1080p display mode
basically blows out all textures and
looks like garbage it's not a setting
I'd recommend for most gamers in terms
of performance I recommend keeping
textures on high unless you're playing
with a VRAM constrained card at higher
resolutions there simply isn't much of a
performance hit switch intermedium
concering low only provides a 2% junk to
performance for a massive loss in
quality on a non vram restricted GPU
again I wouldn't bother with it texture
filtering has a noticeable impact to the
clarity of textures so if you're using
the high texture setting you'll want to
use the maximum 16 times anisotropic
mode here
anisotropic modes 16x through to 4x only
have very small almost imperceptible
changes to clarity it's only when you
drop to 2x that quality begins to fall
away noticeably then using the basic
trilinear mode well that significantly
hurts texture quality so I wouldn't
recommend using it unless you're also
using low textures which means you're
probably on a seriously low-end system
like with an isotropic filtering in most
games the performance impact across the
top three modes is basically zero except
the some games to 1% low performance if
you're experiencing unpleasant
stuttering in some areas I consider
lowering the setting to 4x but for most
users 16x makes the most sense only if
you have an entry-level card should you
experiment with two times an isotropic
filtering and maybe even trilinear
filtering depending on the performance
you getting SSAO or screen space ambient
occlusion is the setting that has the
largest performance impact in the game
there's only two settings on or off and
it seems that the glacier engine uses a
fairly taxing implementation of this
technology the effect certainly looks
good it delivers self shadowing across
most elements in the game world and that
provides depth and realism but it's not
an enormous change to the lighting
system certainly not on the same level
as a regular shadow quality when you
look at the performance impact it's
pretty clear that those on performance
constraint systems should disable SSAO
as the first port of call to gain around
12% to average frame rates and nearly 20
percent to 1 percent low performance
yeah the game will look worse and if
you're already achieving 60fps with ssao
enabled I'd still leave it enabled but
for mid-range gamers who aren't quite
hitting 60fps this single set
might tip you over the edge for
unnoticeable but not significant hit two
visuals I am a little curious as to what
this engine is doing with SSAO that
delivers such a huge performance hit
when enabled it is one of the higher
cost effects in most games but a typical
performance improvement from disabling
the effect it's around the five percent
marks sometimes up to ten percent maybe
a revision to the game engine could
improve this a little bit in hitman -
shadow quality effects shadow resolution
primarily the ultra setting has the
sharpest shadows hi is still pretty good
medium is where you start to see a loss
in sharpness and the low setting
significantly blurs and pixel eights the
edges of shadows this shadow resolution
quality applies to both near and far
shadows while hitman 2 does drop shadow
quality for further away shadows ultra
still delivers higher resolution of far
shadows than medium for example but it
doesn't extend the distance to which you
get the highest quality near shadows
this is especially noticeable when
looking at crowd shadows each member of
the crowd only gets an individual shadow
when you're close to them if you step
back maybe 10 meters those shadows
disappear entirely so what are the
performance improving tricks the game
implements is to use no fire shadows for
crowd members however the point at which
these shadows pop in is going to be
identical for the ultra and low shadow
modes in terms of performance there's
not much difference between ultra and
high and then there's also not much
difference between medium and low but
you will get a 2% improvement to
performance from switching from ultra
down to medium for most gamers I'd
recommend sticking with ultra only on
entry-level systems is it worth dropping
down to medium to get that small
performance improvement the final and
most recently introduced setting is
simulation quality and this is the only
setting that requires a full restart of
the game to change IO Interactive says
this setting improves the amount and
fidelity of crowds cloth destruction and
particle systems depending on your CPU
they recommend using the base mode on
quad-core CPUs the better mode on 6 core
CPUs and the best mode if you have eight
cause despite this advice the game runs
fine on the six core 8700 K with the
best mode I actually found it quite hard
to distinguish between all three modes
in most areas of the maps where this
quality setting is set
have an impact crowd density is one of
the most striking elements to hitman 2
but luckily even on the base mode you're
still going to be getting great crowd
density but there are some areas where
elements are removed on settings below
best for example here you see a section
of simulated flags removed using the
better mode compared to best and then
even more flags are removed on the base
mode it does depend on the area but best
has the highest density game world
in terms of performance you won't see a
big impact to average frame rates
between the 3 modes
however 1% lower performance which in
this game is more CPU dependent does
improve by up to 10% moving from best to
base if you are struggling with FPS
drops in crowd dense areas or you have a
lower end CPU it might be best
experimenting with the base mode just to
drop the density of some world areas so
all up there's not a lot of
recommendations to make here purely
because there Arnel have settings in
hitman two my advice for most gamers
consuming the performance using ultra
settings is just to stick to the highest
settings if you want a bit more
performance the first thing you know
change is turning off SSAO
after that shifting level of detail down
to high or medium would be advised I'd
only mess around with texture quality
texture filtering and shadow quality on
entry level system struggling for
performance
similarly CPU banned gamers might find a
bit of relief with the base simulation
quality setting the good news is the
ultra settings themselves after the most
part well optimised so if you have a
mid-range system you'll likely be
playing at least at 1080p 60fps on
average for a game with great graphics
like this that's a good result none of
the settings deliver stupid performance
penalties for no uplifting graphical
quality everything is well balanced
though I guess perhaps I would like a
less taxing SSA implementation if that's
possible but the same time there's very
little scope for improving frame rates
on lower and Hardware when switching
from everything on the high settings to
everything on the lowest settings we
only saw a 26% improvement to average
frame rates and a 31% improvement to 1%
lows on entry-level hardware you'll see
up to an additional 10% at best so maybe
up to around the 35 percent improvement
mark going from maximum to minimum
quality this puts hitman 2 in an
interesting position it's one of those
games where if you can run it you're
probably going to be running it pretty
well as we've mentioned before 1080p
60 FPS on something like an i9 390 using
ultra settings is about right but if
you're not getting good performance it's
unlikely you'd be able to do much about
it
take the gtx 1050 2 gigabyte for example
which is hovering around 30 FPS using
ultra settings at 1080p there's not much
you can do to make this game close to a
60 FPS experience chuck everything too
low and in a best-case scenario you're
looking at a frame rate in the low 40s
other games like battlefield 5 for
example provide almost double the
performance gain that hitman 2 does when
comparing the minimum coil settings to
ultra this brings lower-end or older
cards into play in a way that hitman two
dozen battlefield 5 also delivers great
visual quality using the ultra preset
and it's well optimized at the high end
but unlike hitman two it also scales
down well thanks to its larger range of
quality options with it man to is narrow
scope for performance scaling it makes
it hard to call the game well optimized
overall it's really only well optimised
if you have decent GPU resources to
begin with it's not an assassin's creed
Odyssey type situation for those with
newer systems it actually runs pretty
well but if your hardware isn't as new
or isn't as high-end hitman 2 could be a
punishing game to run before closing
this one out I want to make special
mention of the reflections in this game
hitman two manages to use real
reflections for many of its surfaces
including shiny floors and mirrors
without needing to use ray tracing this
scene here for example runs at 60fps at
4k on an RT X 2080 yet the floor is a
true reflection not a screen spaced
reflection mirrors as well our true
reflections and there's some cool
gameplay mechanics in the game that make
use of that fact had hit meant to gone
down the DX r or RT X path for
reflections I absolutely would not be
able to play the game at 4k on an RT X
2080 so we're just going to show that
you don't really need ray tracing for
reflections in some games that's it for
this one I'm actually really excited to
play hitman 2 because the first one was
awesome and this newer version seems to
have even more crazy mechanics to play
with it's disappointing the game doesn't
seem to be selling well but hopefully
over time people will come and play this
because it's certainly as a lot of fun
