have some follow-up at geforce gtx 1660
TI content now the meat of this video is
a 33 game benchmark but at the end of
the video i also want to discuss pricing
namely the whole vega 56 debacle anyway
for the benchmark porsche in the video
the focus will be on the 1440p
resolution i do have all the data for
1080p that was also covered in the day 1
review we discussed all the graphs there
we're not going to do that again because
there's a lot of information to go over
and I think the 1440p resolution
probably makes the most sense if we had
to pick one of the two
having said that all 66 graphs covering
the 1080p and 1440p resolutions for all
33 games tested will be available for
free on our patreon page so if you do
want to have a look at the 1080p data
you can follow the link in the video
description
that'll head you have at our patreon
page and you can sift through the thirty
three graphs cover in 1080p there ok so
the day one review looked closely at a
dozen of the more recently released
games such as Resident Evil 2 Metro
Exodus and a few others but with just a
12 game sample I was keen to see how the
1662 I stacked up in a much wider range
of games so today we're doing that the
performance breakdown graphs include the
twelve games we've already looked at
along with 21 new games that we haven't
and 412 of those 21 titles we'll
investigate the results a little more
closely in this video before that though
few quick notes on the test system we're
using a core I $9.99 oh okay clocked at
5 gigahertz with 32 gigabytes of ddr4
3,200 memory as for the drivers we use
adrenalin 2009 10 Edition nineteen point
two point two for the Radeon GPUs and
game ready for 1891 WH QL for the
GeForce GPUs okay let's get into the
results first up we have Assassin's
Creed Odyssey and despite being an AMD
sponsored title it does prefer NVIDIA
Hardware and we see that here as the GTX
1662 AI is able to match Vega 64 and I
was also 42% faster than the rx 590 when
compared to other GeForce parts that
matched the gtx 1070
and it was just 11% slower than the r-tx
20 60 next up we have strange Brigade
and this is another AMD sponsored title
but unlike Assassin's Creed Odyssey this
one does play nice with AMD hardware
interestingly whereas the RT X 2070 is a
good bit faster than GT X 1080 the GTX
1660 Ti is actually a little bit slower
than the gtx 1070 still overall
performance at 1440p was good and the
new affordable cheering GPU also edged
out the RX 590 moving on we have Star
Wars Battlefront 2 and here the gtx 1660
TI demonstrates now it's clearly a class
ahead of the gtx 1066 gigabyte and RX
590 offering over 40% more performance
basically in this title we're looking at
gtx 1070 or Vega 56 light performance
with a healthy 68 FPS on average dirt
for using CMAA
is a bit of an AMD special but even so
the gtx 660ti is still able to edge out
the RX 590 though with just a single
frame in it it's fair to say they
provided the exact same experience the
new $280 churring GPU also roughly match
the gtx 1070 Ti and impressively this
meant it was just 5% slower than the GTX
1080 next up we have Ferrara
here we see the GTX 1660 Ti sorry for
all the 1660s again but it is what it is
we see it creeping in just behind the
gtx 1070 which meant it was also a few
frames down on vega 56 even so it's
still almost 30% faster than the RX 590
and gtx 1060 Sniper Elite 4 is one of
the very few games that supports DirectX
12 and actually runs better using
DirectX 12 that said the GTX 1660 T I
did trail the GTX 1070 by a small margin
in this one it was also 12% slower than
Vega 56 so certainly not a bad result
but also not its best showing either
moving on to the Witcher 3 and here we
see the 1662 I'm matching the gtx 1070
as it often does as such it also matched
vega 56 and was 26% faster than the
radeon RX 590 but most crucially with
the game's visual settings just about
maxed out it provided a very playable 54
FPS on average at 14
EP enabling a much better gaming
experience in either the RX 590 or 6
gigabytes GTX 1060 f1 fans will
appreciate what the gtx 1660 TI has to
offer for less than $300 us basically
looking at performance somewhere between
the gtx 1070 and 1070 TI the Radeon GPUs
do perform very well in this title but
even so the 1660 TI dusted the RX 590 by
a 23% margin so not bad that testing
with Warhammer vermintide to seize the
16 60 TI match Vega 56 and please note I
am using the DirectX 11 API for testing
as it provided smoother performance last
time we checked that said a few Vega
users have been complaining that we're
favoring in video by using dx11
that's obviously not the intention here
and as I said last time we checked dx11
offered better frame time performance
but please note I will be retesting
these GPUs with DirectX 12 to see if
anything's changed as a side note I'm
not sure if those Vega owners I got the
memo but cheering is pretty handy in
DirectX 12 now and Vulcan so don't
expect to see any advantages there
anymore anyway moving along performance
in prey is a little down on what you
might be expecting from the GTX 16 60 TI
still with 86 FPS on average it was well
ahead of the RX 590 and GTX 1066
gigabyte the one percent low result was
also very solid it just lagged behind
the 1070 by a 9% margin which I have to
say was a little bit surprising now the
second last game that we're going to
look at results from is Kingdom Come
deliverance and here the 1660 ti can be
found sitting between the 1070 and 1070
TI this made it around 14 to 15 percent
slower than the are Tex 2060 and Vega 56
it also wasn't that much faster than the
rx 590 well it was 22% faster but given
we've seen it up around 40% faster at
times a 22% margin isn't the most
extreme we've seen that's for sure
last up we've already seen how warframe
runs better with Pascal based GPUs for
example the GTX 1080 is 8 percent faster
than the RT X 2070 and while here the
GTX 1070 was 16% far
than the 1660 TI in fact the new budget
cheering offering was just 9 percent
faster than the gtx 1066 gigabytes so
fairly disappointing result to end on
there and i suppose an equally
disappointing result for any warframe
fans
okay so jumping right into it here's the
geforce gtx 1660 TI vs gtx 1066 gigabyte
and in our day 1 content we saw that the
gtx 1660 TI came out 40% faster on
average when compared to the gtx 1066
gigabyte at 1440p interestingly that
figure has dropped quite a bit in the 33
game comparison now the 1660 Ti is just
34% faster and middle II though that's
still a decent margin the reason for
this is down to the selection of games
which is I suppose pretty obvious in the
day 1 content we only included a dozen
tiles and of those dozen tiles most of
them by pure chance were more favorable
to the churring GPU the focus was on new
title such as shut off the Tomb Raider
apex legends resin evil 2 and hitman 2
for example and all seem too heavily
favored the 1660 ti however now we've
included games such as warframe shadow
of war and about half a dozen other
tiles that's all the 1662 I beat the
1060 by less than 30% so that brought
the average down by 6% making the 1662 a
34% faster on average again not bad
given it only cost 12% more then we have
the gtx 1070 in our day 1 coverage the
1662 was found to be 2 percent faster
average and because of that we know the
performance to be basically the same
overall now in our 33 game test the 1662
I came out exactly level with the 1070
so they're no longer basically the same
overall they are the same also this
graph gives us a good idea of where
cheering is much more efficient than
Pascal of course cheering is faster
under all conditions it's just that here
we're comparing a 1920 critical pascal
part with a 1500 and 36 quartering part
then for the RT x 2060 comparison we see
similar margins to that of the day 1
content previously the 1662 I was 12%
slower and now in the 33 game compared
that has increased ever so slightly to
14% I'll have to go back and retest
Forza horizon for to try and work out
what's going on there but other than
that the only other major outliers
included warframe Metro Exodus and World
of Tanks the performance margin is also
much the same for the radiant rx 590
comparison previously we found the 1660
ti to be 25% faster now it's 24% faster
so much of a muchness there really then
the margin of Vega 56 remains exactly
the same at 8% though here we do see a
few examples where the GTX 1662 I was
significantly slower this is seen in
title such as warframe Strange Brigade
battlefield 5 dirt 4 and Resident Evil 2
for example that said the 1662 I was a
wee bit faster and Assassin's Creed
Odyssey fortnight vermin tied to an apex
legends there anyone percent margin was
seen in the last two and that's near
enough to identical performance and
finally we have one last graph a quick
cost per frame comparison update here
we're mostly only seeing a change of two
to maybe four fps in fact it's really
only the Radeon seven that saw a
significant change in the 33 game sample
here it stacks up much better than the
previous 12 game comparison still for
this video we're not really interested
in Radeon 700 Vega 56 and the RX 590 and
580 play a much more significant roles
in this comparison that said overall
little has changed the GTX 1660 Ti is
just 9 percent more costly than the rx
580 per frame but 12 percent cheaper
than the rx 590 and 22 percent cheaper
than Vega 56 and that is of course at
the more typical $400 u.s. asking price
then compared to the RT x 2060 the cost
per frame of the 16 60 Ti is improved by
7 percent so a solid result for the new
gtx graphics card ok so that's how the
geforce gtx 1660 TI stacks up in a wide
range of games and it was interesting to
see where it often are really big gains
over GPU such as the gtx 1066 gigabyte
and then other games where the gains
were less impressive speaking of the gtx
1060 the 1660 T I did look less
appealing for owners of the 60 gigabyte
models in this
benchmark comparison but still a 34%
performance boost on average still
nothing to scoff at I think if I was
currently gaming with the GTX 1066
gigabyte I suppose even a three gigabyte
probably doesn't really matter and I was
after something with a bit more punch I
would really consider upgrading to the
GTX 1662 I as I said in the day one
content
it offers next G performance so it's a
whole tier above what you get from the
1060 and it's really a small price
premium to take that step up to the next
tier of course if you have anything
faster than a 1060 or a radio rx 580
something faster such as Vega 56 or a
gtx 1070 then I think this really still
there's still no worthwhile upgrade
choice so the RT x cards they're a bit
they're not they're not great in terms
of value so yes still nothing really
really compelling there nothing gtx 1660
TI levels of compelling and obviously if
you have a Vega 56 or a gtx 1070
graphics card then you would overlook
the 1660 TI as it has nothing to offer
you then for those of you coming from a
much older mid-range GPU your choices
right now they are quite limited they
seem to be either the new gtx 1660 TI or
vega 56 the RX 590 in my opinion it just
simply isn't fast enough to be compared
with the 1660 TI or Vega 56 obviously
it's a whole level down and it just
doesn't offer great value there are some
models that have dipped down as low as I
think it was $240 u.s. when I was
checking just before putting this video
together and although it doesn't offer
the same level of performance as a 16-6
TTI it does get a bit closer in terms of
cost per frame at the $240 u.s. price
but as I said if you're looking for
something that offers Vega 56 sort of
performance then yeah well you're not
after Eric's 590 and of course if you
are looking at rx 590 type performance
well you just buy an rx 580 because it
is still much better value you can get
them quite easily for $200 and that's
$40 US less so this leaves Vega 56 and
at the more tea
Pikul $400 us asking price it's really a
non contest that said let's just talk
about Vega 56 pricing for a bit when we
were piecing our initial GTX 1660 TI
review together major online US retailer
such as Amazon and Newegg had one or two
models down around $400 with the
majority priced much closer to $500 that
said we felt $400 was a better price for
this comparison as that is the price
should be looking at purchasing one for
anyway about a day before the GTX 1662 I
was set to go on sale Newegg along with
a few other big online retailers saw the
writing on the wall presumably they had
quite a bit of Vega 56 stock on hand
namely the MSI air boost model
it's an unappealing blower style card
and they probably had a big oil left
over after the cryptocurrency collapse
so with an unknown but likely large
amount of these things sitting in
warehouses they obviously knew the
second a GPU that was just 10% slower on
average but at least 30% cheaper arrived
moving that stock was going to be near
on impossible so they did what all
retailers do in this situation and that
was to create a fire sale AMD caught
wind of this in an effort to disrupt the
GTX 1662 I release and potentially
manipulate reviews they promoted this
deal essentially leading reviewers and
consumers on hinting that this was a new
competitive price to combat the 16 60 TI
of course tech news being what it is
countless media outlets reported on this
as an official price cut and while the
rest is history
now our review was spammed with comments
from viewers claiming that the cost per
frame analysis was misleading biased or
incorrect whatever you want because Vega
56 is now $280 us not $400 thing is
before the review went live I contacted
AMD directly about the $280 listing on
new egg and they said it was a limited
time only deal and it had already sold
out the MSRP hadn't changed so that's
that really in Vega 56 is still a 400
ish US dollar product and getting one
for well under that prices be very
difficult I think that's
to say I've also been made aware that
some of European retailers are really
competitive with Vega pricing haven't
looked into that too much myself so if
that is the case well you can take our
cost per frame stuff the fps is there
and then you can just divide the price
by the fps that'll give you the cost per
frame and you can work out what the best
value option is in your region if it
happens to be Vega well great
get Vega we're certainly not against
getting Vega if it's priced right a
ternary Allah's us it would be a a
really really good card to buy the
blower style MSI air boost that they
were selling is yeah not great but yet
for $200 u.s. it does offer a very
impressive level of performance but
anyway don't really follow the European
retailers or the pricing there so I'm
not someone you should follow if you're
interested in that pricing or at least
my opinion on pricing in your region the
focus here is very much on us and then
Australian pricing here in Australia
looking at spending at least $700 to nab
a Vega 56 graphics card meanwhile 16 60
TI models can be had for four hundred
and seventy dollars so margins are the
same as the US then the GeForce GPU is
at least 30% cheaper 33% in that example
now if you can get a Vega 56 graphics
card for $280 u.s. or four hundred and
seventy dollars Aussie then yeah it's
worth getting but good luck with that
truth is AMD can't afford to compete
with the gtx 660ti using vega 56 it just
costs too much to produce which is why
we knew this alleged price drop was
almost certainly bogus so having said
that don't expect a true gtx 1660 TI
competitor from AMD until navi drops
right now there are currently a number
of sixteen sixty TI graphics cards
available at the $280 u.s. MSRP ZOTAC
has their gaming model msi has the
ventus gigabytes offering a base model
OC card as well as a mini ITX version so
getting a decent model for the MSRP
isn't an issue i actually really like
the look of MSI is Ventus card I have
been wanting to at my hands I want
for review for some time now and the
1662 and while it looks pretty good so
I'll do my best to get my hands on one
of those ASAP for a review as it stands
the GTX 1662 I really has no competition
it also has a crap name but let's not
waste time getting into that one yeah I
won't waste time getting into that when
I kind of want to but maybe we'll talk
about how weird
Nvidia's new naming schemes are in
another video I don't touch on that and
reply in the comments episode because
quite a few of you did bring it up and
hopefully I can do one of them next week
anyway like I said unless you can snap
up Vega 56 for a bargain-basement price
then it's really not worth considering
at least in my opinion and the RX 590 is
well it's really a gtx 1066 a gigabyte
competitor so i think that's probably
enough for this one hopefully you guys
enjoyed the video if you did you know
what to do you can subscribe for more
content just like this and if you'd like
to support us more directly you can do
so via patreon again links in the video
description and you can head over there
and get all the graphs for all the data
that we've collected for free so you
don't actually have to be a patreon
member to grab that but of course while
you're over there if you would like to
support us then you do get some cool
perks like access to our exclusive
discord chat monthly live streams we
will be streaming for our patreon
members on Monday so a few days from now
actually it it'll be tomorrow when this
video goes out so tomorrow we will
streaming we will be streaming through
patreon members and we'll be talking
about a whole heap of things probably
the gtx 1660 TI tim wants to discuss
deal SS all that sort of stuff so yeah
should be really good anyway I am
waffling a bit thank you for watching I
am your host Steve I'll see you again
