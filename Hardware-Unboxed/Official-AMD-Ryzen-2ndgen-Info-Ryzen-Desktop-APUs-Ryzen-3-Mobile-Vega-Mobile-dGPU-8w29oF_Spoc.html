unboxed I'm currently over in Las Vegas
where AMD has detailed a whole bunch of
stuff that will be coming out this year
covering a range of products segments I
reckon that's enough intro for this
video as there's quite a lot to get
through so let's move on to the actual
announcements from this see yes you
probably want to hear about second
generation rising desktop CPUs first
which AMD briefly mentioned during their
event unfortunately we didn't receive
full details on processor skews
performance improvements or pricing but
we did get a launch window April 2018
second gen Reisman will be built on a 12
nanometer process using the Zen plus
architecture which includes minor
optimizations - first gen Zen aimed II
did say these new chips will feature
higher clock speeds and new boost
technologies both precision boost - and
xfr - they also hinted at double-digit
performance gains though they weren't
exactly specific on any claims as AMD
promised earlier 2nd gen Reisman will be
fully compatible with existing 300
series chipsets although it will launch
alongside new 400 series chipsets all
the key features of second generation
will be supported on both platforms
though the 400 series chipset will
supposedly allow greater performance
lower power and some new feature
additions most of these improvements to
the 400 series chipsets involve better
memory support and greater support for
overclocking at least from what AMD has
said so far further in the future AMD
said the Zen 2 architecture designed for
7 nanometers is now designed complete
and on track for release probably next
year with Zen 3 also on track probably
again for the year after that's all we
have on second gen rising right now
so clearly AMD you know they'll be
releasing a bit more information closer
to that April 2018 launch date the
product line aimed he was willing to
talk about is its desktop rise an AP use
codenamed Pinnacle Ridge you
able to buy an a m4 compatible Rison
processor with integrated Vega graphics
as soon as February 12 in fact two
models will be available at that date
the horizon 520 400 G and the Rison 320
200 G these two ApS are pretty crazy in
what they offer at a low price point the
Rison 520 400 G for example has a four
core eight thread CPU clocked at 3.6
gigahertz with a boost up to 3.9
gigahertz it also packs a Vega GPU with
11 compute units or 704 shader cores
with a base clock of 1240 megahertz
you get all of this for just a hundred
and sixty-nine dollars which is only
five bucks more than the Rison v 1400
yet you get higher CPU clocks out of the
box and decent integrated graphics the
Rison 320 200 G is even better value it
offers four CPU cores and four threads
clocked a 3.5 gigahertz with the boost
of 3.7 gigahertz plus an 8 compute unit
Vega GPU all for just $99 that is
cheaper than the Rison 3 1200 but packs
a faster CPU and integrated graphics as
well it sounds pretty strange that both
these APIs are cheaper than existing
rising cpus while offering more
performance but that's the situation I
guess amy has shown some performance
numbers for both AP use and the Rison
520 400 G in particular is at least in
their testing as fast as an Intel Core
i5 8400 paired with an NVIDIA GeForce GT
1030
this makes the Rison 520 400 G at least
a hundred bucks cheaper for the same
supposed performance if not more
considering you know the 8400 is rare
and still sold at inflated prices and
that's not to mention the risin 5 2400
G's lower total TDP of just 65 watts
these AP you should overclock very well
to a demo I saw showed the risin 5 2400
G hitting 17 50 megahertz on the GPU
with the standard air cooler and when
combined with fast memory this led to a
near 40% uplift in 3d marked fire strike
performance of course the risin 5 2400
GS
CPU is also overclockable so you could
potentially get even more out of this
apu when you use the same overclocking
techniques as existing rise and CPUs on
top of this ami has announced a new box
cool at the wraith prison which features
a better Finn profile for compact
systems direct copper heat pipe contact
with the CPU and I guess that thing that
all of you guys are after a ton more RTP
lighting oh and Amy also made Rison CPU
price cuts official we've seen reduced
rise in CPU prices at places like Amazon
and Newegg for a while now but AMD has
now officially reduced the price of
every rise and morale to keep them
highly competitive with Intel if these
cuts haven't pushed through to retail
just yet they should be hopefully
available very soon moving on to the
mobile side of things we're AMD also
made a bunch of announcements starting
with the launch of Rison 3 AP use for
mobile systems these ApS are a
continuation of what AMD brought to the
table with Rison 5 and Rison 7 from
mobile except with lower core slashed
thread counts and lower GPU compute unit
counts the Rison 3 2300 you the first
Rison 3 mobile part is a 4 core for
thread part clocked at 2.0 gigahertz
base with the 3.4 gigahertz maximum
frequency which one was CPU perspective
makes it a slightly lower clocked Rison
5 2500 you that lacks SMT it also
features a cut-down GPU moving from 6
compute units from 8 in the rise and 5
model the low respect rise in three 2200
year round that AMD's line are providing
a 2 core 4 thread C period 2.5 gigahertz
boosting up to 3.4 gigahertz along with
a 3 compute unit Vega GPU when looking
at sort of the raw performance metrics I
guess this should provide similar CPU
and GPU performance as Intel 7th gen 15
watt mobile parts the best aspect to
rise in mobile and Amy's latest
announcements is we are starting to see
aim to get these ApS in laptops people
actually might consider buying aside
from the HP Acer and Lenovo systems
we've already seen at least on paper in
some cases more devices from these OEMs
along with the likes of Dell
and a soos are in the pipeline and we
will be seen these chips in a wide range
of products everything from mainstream
notebooks to high-end ultra portables in
both thirteen and fifteen inch form
factors I can't talk just yet about some
of the laptops I've seen so far some of
which look very enticing but it's clear
AMD is getting much better
om traction with Verizon mobile than
their previous gen laptop parts and even
Amb themselves say this apu generation
has brought the widest range of consumer
ultra thins in the company's history the
risin three apos officially launched on
January 9th
although it may take a few weeks or
months for partner models to hit the
market
we should however be seeing more rise in
five and rise in seven laptops in
January to round out AMD set of CES
announcements we have vega now I
wouldn't be getting too excited for any
desktop announcements here because the
only real desktop class product company
revealed was a seven nanometer Vega
variant for their Radeon instinct
compute card line for you know data
centers and that sort of thing Navi
still seems a while away so perhaps
we'll get more consumer Vega offerings
at a later stage this year but you know
nothing is confirmed at this stage Elise
from what we heard about in the past
couple of days what aim he did announce
on the Vega front is Vega mobile a
discrete GPU offering for ultra-thin
gaming notebooks again not a whole lot
of information on specifications but we
do know Vega mobile will pack HBM too
and it will feature a 1.7 millimeters ed
height which makes the chip itself a lot
slimmer than other mobile GPU offerings
you know allowing OMS to create slimmer
high-performance portable gaming systems
the desktop vague offering for example
features is ed height more in the three
millimeter range no word on when Vega
mobile discrete GPUs will be available
but it doesn't sound too far away again
this is something AMD will have to
detail at a future date and as a quick
note amy also revealed that modern
Radeon cards will support HDMI 2.1 with
variable refresh technology so I guess
that's a kind of neat little addition
there so anyway that's basically
everything aimed he was ready to
announce at this stage the rise in
desktop ApS in particular sound quite
interesting particularly for those
looking at building a budget system so
be interesting to see what Steve thinks
of them when he gets his hands on them
shortly
considering performance should be in the
ballpark of an Intel system with
discrete GT 1030 graphics but you know
in a far lower overall cost it could be
a great option for those wanting to
build a basic computer for some light
gaming don't discount the overclocking
support either that can bring some
pretty serious performance gains here
unfortunately we will have to wait a bit
longer to hear more about second gen
rise and though it's only a few months
before those you hit the market and it's
a little tidbit to get excited about in
the future thread Ripper 2nd gen is
slated for the second half of the as
well so a lot of exciting stuff coming
up that's it for now hopefully we'll be
getting our hands on Ryze and desktop
APs and some more rising robot products
shortly we won't be doing a whole lot of
other CES coverage as neither Steve or I
will be at the event but you might see
some occasional videos during this show

when I'm back in Australia in the next
couple of days I'll catch you next time
