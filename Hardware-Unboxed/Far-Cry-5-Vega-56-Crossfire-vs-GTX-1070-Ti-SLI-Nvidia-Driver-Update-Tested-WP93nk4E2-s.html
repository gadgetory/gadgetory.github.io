today's video is just a quick follow-up
to the testing feature than yesterday's
50 GPU comparison in Far Cry 5 since
completing the big benchmark video in
video released their game ready driver I
knew they'd drop that shortly after the
video went live though they haven't
noted any performance improvements and
said they've just said this new driver
delivers an optimal gaming experience
far cry 5 since Nvidia is making no bold
claims I wasn't really expecting much
but there is at least some performance
uplift and we'll look at that in a
moment something else I wasn't expecting
was so many of you requesting multi-gpu
benchmarks have you learnt nothing just
kidding guys that was just a joke but
yeah I suppose when will I learn
you just don't joke about these things
during GPU wars anyway I decided to
retest a few high-end NVIDIA GPUs with
the new driver and then I tried that SLI
with the gtx 1070 TI cards and found ok
scaling performance frame time
performance was also good and the
experience of 4k was actually very nice
that said I also decided to test out
crossfire with Vega 56 and I found what
I'd say was a bit better than ok ok so
first things first the new Nvidia 390
1.35 driver and as expected the gains
are minimal the GTX 1082 I was around 3%
faster at most we saw about a 4%
performance gain we're looking at a 1 to
3 FPS increase here so this is probably
why Nvidia didn't make any performance
claims still future drivers may improve
things further but as I noted in my
previous video the experience with the
GeForce graphics cards are still very
good it just seems like a Vega is being
well utilized here the previous
generation maxwell parts for example
we're able to match and even beat the
Radeon 300 series so in videos GPUs
certainly aren't handicapped by any
means he's a quick look at how the
high-end model stack up after the new
NVIDIA GeForce driver
as you can see Vega 56 still roughly
matches the GTX today at 14:40 P well
Vega 64 is still noticeably faster the
margin between Vega 64 liquid and the G
x10 atti has grown slightly but in any
case the gtx 1080 TI was the better
value option here even in this title
now for the multi-gpu results and I have
to say I'm somewhat impressed at least
when looking at the 4k results starting
with 1440p though we only see a 42%
increase for both the average and 1% low
figures for the gtx 1070 TI cards when
compared to the single card
configuration the vega 56 models weren't
much better the 1% low figure was
improved by just 33% while we saw 47%
more frames on average both crossfire
and sli provided less than a 50%
performance uplift here so that's pretty
poor to be honest
however at 4k the gtx 1070 TI sli cards
improved to the 1% lower result by 44%
and provided almost 60% more frames on
average that's not great but it's not
bad either like I said earlier I'd
characterize this result as OK the Vega
56 crossfire cards those saw a 65
percent boost to the 1 percent low
result and a whopping 80 percent uplift
for the average frame rate and that's
much better than ok it's obviously not
perfect scaling but we are talking about
SLI and crossfire here after all
and I'll take 80% every day of the week
beyond just numbers on a graph in game
performance was excellent as well both
SLI and crossfire proved to be very
smooth the only issue I encountered with
the Vega 56 cards was that the rivatuner
statistics overlay that I often used to
show you guys various statistics that
would flicker like mad not the game
itself just the statistics overlay but
things like fraps did work ok here's a
quick look at some 4k gameplay using the
Vega 56 crossfire cards and please note
I'm using re-live to record the footage
so there is a small amount of overhead
they're still the performance he
reflects exactly what I saw with the
built-in benchmark as the frame rates
mostly hovered around the mid-70s
despite the solid result here I still
don't really like SLI or crossfire as
game support is limited and it's often
just more of a headache than it's worth
but that's really just my opinion so
take that as you will but as someone who
has the option of running to 1080 TI's
or to Vega 64 liquid cards in my own
personal gaming rig I simply choose not
to
again in my opinion it's just a waste
that said if by some miracle you only
seem to play games that do have great
multi-gpu support like far cry 5 and you
must game at 4k with all the eye candy
turned up then SLI and crossfire can be
useful and that is going to do it for

same and if you did hit the like button
