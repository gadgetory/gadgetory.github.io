hope you're doing well wherever you are
and you're ready for another benchmark
video because today I have a good one
for you with all the recent gaming
benchmarks comparing the 8th gen core
series from Intel to aim DS rise and
CPUs many of you been asking me to
compare some older CPUs in particular
there's been a huge amount of requests
for a 4th gen core i7 versus 8th gen
core i7 test so I thought hey that's a
pretty good idea like to do that so
today we're comparing the core i7 4770k
to the new core i7 8700 KD in a range of
games but before we get to the results
here are a few notes there are two
unlocked fourth gen Core i7 processors
the 4770k and the 4790k they are
essentially the same CPU and both are
based on these same Haswell architecture
the 4770k was released in mid 2013 but
with nothing new ready a year later and
virtually no competition from AMD Intel
just simply refreshed as well by
essentially overclocking it and
releasing a new range of chipsets the
result for the flagship line was the
updated 4790k sporting a 500 megahertz
overclock taking it for a base frequency
of 3.5 units to full Gertz since I am
testing both stock and overclocked
performance I decided to go with the
4770k as it really is a worst case
scenario if you happen to own either the
4770k other 4790k this video should give
you a good idea of the games you'd
expect when upgrading to the newly
released core i7 8700 K actually the
benchmark results should also be quite
useful for Haswell core i5 owners who
are considering buying a secondhand core
i7 or just biting the bullet and getting
a new 8th gen processor which of course
also means upgrading their motherboard
and memory apart from the small IPC
gains Intel's made over the past four
years along with the additional 50%
cores and threads the other big
advantage the 87 Rika enjoys is that
support for faster higher clocked ddr4
memory speaking of which the 4770k will
be tested with ddr3 2400 memory and then
afforded a memory bandwidth of around 29
gigabytes per second the 87 can the
other hand will be using ddr4 3200
memory
and this allows for a bandwidth of about
42 gigabytes per second providing with
roughly 45% more bandwidth anyway there
are loads of benchmark results to look
at and discuss but before we do today's

description to get set up and start
downloading today big thanks for story
blocks for supporting our work and of
course you guys for also being very
supportive alright let's get to the
benchmarks first up we have the very CPU
demanding ashes of the singularity and
for this test we're using the DirectX 12
API with the GTX 10 atti
the resolution has been set at a DP and
this is the same resolution I'll be
using for all the testing in this video
while ashes of the singularity has been
tested with the higher quality preset
here we see that prior to any
overclocking the 4770k is able to
outclassed the 7600 I thought was 14%
slower than the 7700 K quite
surprisingly overclocking had a little
impact on performance and even at 4.6
gigahertz the 4770k was 25% slower than
the 8700 k so unsurprisingly in a game
that can utilize the 87 our case extra
course it does enjoy a decent
performance advantage ashes of the
singularity is one of the few games out
right now that takes advantage of
process with more than eight threads on
offer so I don't expect to see this kind
of margin in many or if any of the other
games that I've tested with moving on we
have the battlefield 1 results and we
that we have another CPU demanding title
as you can see the 7600 K gets hit
really hard for the 1% low result
dropping down to just 79 FPS and while
that's still a high frame rate the 4770k
add its stock 3.5 gigahertz operating
frequency was much faster at 96 frames
per second
once overclocked the 4770k managed a
minimum of a hundred and thirteen FPS
which placed it on par with the 7700 k
however the faster ddr4 memory allowed
the 77 okay at times to push the 1080i
to higher frame rates and therefore it
achieved a higher average frame rate the
87 okay wasn't much faster compared to
the overclocked 4770k it was just 12%
faster for the minimum frame rate that
was 18% faster for the average I should
also note the frame rate cap in the game
was removed for this test so we are
seeing the limits of the tennety TI here
next up we have the dawn of all three
results and here these stock 4770k looks
particularly weak though again I should
note that it did only dip down to 59 fps
and was able to deliver very smooth
player performance perfectly smooth
playable performance in fact overclocked
though it did look much more respectable
and it now is at least on par with the
core i5 8400 when compared to the
overclocked 4770k the 87 era K was 17
percent faster for the minimum results
and 11% for the average 17% certainly
sounds like a decent margin but again go
from a hundred and sixteen FPS to 129
fps isn't a noticeable gain in this
title even the difference between
dipping to 71 fps opposed to 83 fps
isn't noticeable or at least it wasn't
in my opinion recently I tested many of
these CPUs in dawn of War 3 using Vegas
64 liquid-cooled so I thought as a bonus
I'd add the 4770k to those results as
well I'm yet to test all the rise in
CPUs with the GT X 1080 Ti so for those
wanting to know how the 4770k stacks up
to say the 1600 X this will give you a
pretty good idea here we can see with a
slower graphics card the overclocked
4770k is able to match the 7700 K and
isn't a great deal slower than the 8700
K it has to be said Vega actually does
quite poorly in this title for example
Vega 64 liquid core isn't much faster
than Vega 56 and therefore both are very
similar to the gtx 1070 for this test
that's kind of a good thing though is it
shows that for those using something
like Vega 50
- gtx 1070 there really isn't much to be
had by upgrading to the 87 okay from the
4770k especially if you happy
overclocking and i'll talk more about
this a bit later on moving on we have
the Deus Ex mankind divider results
using the DirectX 12 API and again the
stock 4770k looks a little slow in fact
even once overclocked it's only just
able to edge out the core i5 72 Turner
okay and this meant that the 77 or okay
was 25% faster when comparing the
minimum frame rate that said the 77 okay
along with the 87 okay hit a GPU
bottleneck and therefore those gaming at
1440p with the GTX 1082 I will likely
see no difference between the 4770k and
the 8700 K for example so keep that in
mind with dirt 4 we see fairly
consistent 1% lower results with the GTX
280 across all CPUs tested
so although the 87 ok allowed for an
average of 196 FPS this meant that it
was still just 8% faster when compared
to the overclocked 4770k
for the average framerate just 6% faster
for the minimum since even the stock
4770k maintained over 100 FPS at all
times it's fair to say even for high
refresh rate gamers the 87 offers a
little to nothing over the 4th gen core
i7 at least in this title 2017 s most
optimized and consumer friendly title
Assassin's Creed origins has been
included in the list of games tested
with more security than the US president
this game eats up threads and yet
despite that the 4770k isn't much faster
than the higher clocked 7600 k
overclocking the 4770k only boosts a
performance by 10%
I suspect once again we're probably
memory limited still when looking at the
minimum result the 87 ok was just 8%
faster the overclocked 4770k so it's
hardly going to be a noticeable margin
moving on we have project cows - and
this is a fairly CPU demanding racing
simulator stock the 4770k looks quite
slow it has to be said though
overclocked it is able to match the core
i5 8400 as performance is boosted by
around 17% as a result the edgiest
americaís was just 8 percent faster for
the minimum frame rate in what was a
very mild gain next up we have a Rainbow
six siege and while this is a CPU
intensive game a quad core with eight
threads is more than enough
as demonstrated by the core i7 4770k
out-of-the-box that was comparable to
the 7600 okay while an edged ahead once
overclocked the 8700 K did offer 17%
more performance when comparing the
minimum frame rate but with all CPUs
pushing the GTX 1080i to over 140 FPS at
all times I'm not sure how meaningful
that increase is now for the last two
games I've tested with being total war
Warhammer - and Call of Duty World War 2
we're going to look at the performance
across three presets being medium high
and ultra with the gtx 1080i
just for something different starting
with the medium results we see something
quite interesting although the average
framerate is very similar across the
CPUs tested the 1% low result does vary
quite a bit even once overclock the
4770k trails the 7600 K and is 22%
slower than the 8700 K that said though
I have to point out once again that
framerate did remain well over 100 FPS
at all times
increasing the GPU load with the higher
quality preset the overclocked 4770k
minimum result is just 14% lower than
that of the 8700 k this margin would of
course be reduced further at high
resolution such as 1440p speaking of
which let's simulate that you know why I
suppose by using the ultra quality
preset well there you go playing with a
gtx 1080i at 1080p this game is heavily
GPU bound with the ultra quality
settings remember most games we've
looked at so far were tested with the
second highest quality preset and able
to try and reduce the GPU bottleneck
though I'm aware doing so comes with
mixed blessings anyway here we see
virtually no difference in performance
between any of the CPUs tested whereas
previously the overclocked 4770k was as
much as 22 percent slower than the 87
okay before moving on I thought I'd give
you a look at the Vegas 64 liquid core
results for Warhammer 2 for those of you
wondering this GPU sits between the GTX
1080 and 1080i in this title using the
higher quality preset at 1080p this has
allowed the overclocked 77 okay to close
in on the 87 okay the previous high
quality tests with the GTX 1080p I saw
the Haswell CPU trail by a 14% margin
now with Vegas 64 it's just 10% slower
now the last game I'll be testing with
is Call of Duty World War 2 and again
let's check three quality levels normal
high and X
try starting with normal we find that
even when overclocked the 4770k derails
the 7600
in fact overclocked the older core i7
processors average frame rate was
boosted by just 10% as a result this
meant it was a little over 20% slower
than the 87 okay but again with well
over 100 FPS at all times the margin
probably doesn't mean that much
increasing the quality preset to high
doesn't change the margins much and here
the 4770k still allowed for well over
100 FPS at all times at least once
overclocked even with the extra quality
settings enabled and those are the ultra
or maximum type quality settings the
overclocked 4770k was still 24% slower
than the 8700 k when comparing the
average frame rate the 4770k again looks
to be bandwidth limited as the 4.6 year
overclocked did little to improve
performance okay so we've now looked at
a heap of results what's the verdict
okay let's try and cover this from a few
different angles first angle of attack
head-on a simple no it's not worth the
upgrade from a fourth gen a core i7
processor to the latest and greatest six
core 8th gen core i7s we're not seeing
scenarios where a hyper threading
enabled quad core can't deliver playable
performance in fact we're not even
seeing scenarios where it's even on the
edge for the most part testing was
conducted with the geforce gtx 980ti
which has currently the world's fastest
gaming GPU testing also took place at
turnin opinion for the most part we
weren't maxing out the visual quality
settings on my opinion these results
really show a I suppose realistic
worst-case if you will worst case would
be a lower resolution with lower quality
settings so let's talk more realistic
settings with the GTX 1080i for these
ashes of the singularity is a good
example because it fully utilizes a six
core 12 thread processor and therefore
the 87 or okay was quite a bit faster
than even the 4770k
even with the odd fourth gen chorus of
an overclocked the average frame rate
was almost 33% greater that's an
incredible difference and honestly more
than I was expecting to see using the
same GPU but now at the extreme quality
preset reduces the 33% margin seen
previously to just 17
as we're now more limited by the GTX 10
atti but that's not even the highest
visual quality preset let's see how
things look with the crazy preset thanks
to the game's ability to really take
full advantage of higher-end CPUs the 87
our case still comes out on top here but
it is now just 9% faster this really is
a best-case result 437 okay as most
titles would see no difference in
performance when using maximum quality
settings take total war Warhammer - for
example using the ultra quality preset
completely neutralize the playing field
so while it's easy to get caught up in
the CPU limited benchmarks because they
do look the most impressive you do to
the largest margins there for the most
part the reality for gamers will be far
more GPU limited remember we are still
using a GTX 280 Ti so even if you're the
kind of game where that will turn the
quality settings down a little bit to
boost GPU performance doing so with
something like a gtx 1070 will still
result in a GPU limited scenario that is
assure me that you don't go excessively
low on the quality settings for example
I went back and tested battlefield one
using the gtx 1070 and compared the
results to the gtx 1080i using both the
medium and ultra quality presets at the
top of the graph you can see both cpus
compared with the gtx 1080i using the
medium quality settings and here the 87
okay is 23% faster on average and 19%
faster for the 1% below result swapping
to the gtx 1070 and now the 87 RK is
just 1% faster on average and 10% faster
for the 1% low but again we are only
using the medium quality settings
increasing visual quality with the ultra
preset and therefore GPU load the 87 or
okay is now just 16% faster on average
with the 1080 TI and 19% faster for the
1% low now the really telling result can
be seen when using the ultra quality
preset with the gtx 1070 now there is no
distinguishing between the 87 okay and
the 4770k
in fact you'd likely get the same
results without even overclocking the
4th gen core i7 processor as a side note
to all of this you can of course
overclock the 87 are ok for even greater
performance when not GPU bound the ones
I've noticed gamers are almost always
GPU bound with higher-end core i7 CPUs
so I hope that addresses why I haven't
complicated things by also over
clocking the 8700 K so to reiterate I
don't think the upgrade from either the
4770k or the 4790k to the 8700 K it's a
lot of Kay's is going to be worth that
for the most part gamers won't even
notice the difference
although decent gains were at time
seeing with the GTX 10 atti
you do have to be playing at 1080p and
you can't be upscaling or making heavy
use of anti-aliasing for example
meanwhile if you're spending $700 us on
a graphics card buying a new CPU
motherboard and memory combo isn't
something you only think twice about
anyway I suspect most gamers will be
using something more like a gtx 1070 as
we just saw the circumstances where the
87 or okay Willa for any kind of gain is
rare now just lastly what about those
with a core i5 46 70 K or 4690k what
should they do
buy a secondhand core i7 or upgraded the
entire platform and go with a coffee
like CPU assuming you could buy one at
or near the MSRP personally I'd look for
a secondhand core i7 processor they're
currently selling for between 150 and
200 dollars u.s. on eBay with Buy Now
options price between 220 and 250
dollars u.s. give it the 87 or K
features an MSRP of 360 dollars u.s.
it's certainly a much more costly
endeavor you could even buy one for that
price and then of course you do have to
also buy as at 370 motherboard and ddr4
memory which is also not very cheaper
right now the upgrade to the Rison v
1600 is certainly much more
cost-effective but even so you're not
really gaining anything when coming
especially from a fourth gen core i7 at
least not right now anyway it will be
likely a few years before the true value
of these six cord 12 thread CPUs will be
realized at least for gaming on that
note if you do anything else with your
PC other than gaming as in productivity
type work maybe video encoding for
example then the rise in v 1600 would
very much be a worthwhile upgrade or
perhaps even the rise in seven 1700
anyway that's not really what this video
is about the focus was on gaming and I
think we covered everything so with that
I'm gonna go on and get out of here on a
final note they were big thank you to
