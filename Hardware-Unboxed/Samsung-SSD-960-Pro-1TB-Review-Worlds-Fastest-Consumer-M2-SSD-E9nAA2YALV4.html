another hardware unboxed video today
Matt isn't with us he's a little busy
with a few other things so I've stepped
in
or rather sat down to take care of
Samsung's latest and greatest SSD
speaking of which do you find that
today's PCI Express SSDs are just a tad
too slow well of course you do what am I
saying sequential read speeds of up to
2.5 gigabytes per second right speed
through even less come on guys this is
2016 thankfully someone has stood up and
address this bandwidth crisis our Savior
once again is Samsung forget about those
lousy 2.5 gigabytes per second read
speeds if you aren't pushing over three
gigs you might as well have a hard drive
okay so I'm being a tad overdramatic
here still it's hard not to take the
mickey when you see consumer grade
storage device is capable of 3.5
gigabytes per second for the reads
coupled with 2.1 gigabytes per second
write speeds that's right these are the
advertised sequential read and write
speeds for samsung's new 960 pro series
replacing the now year old 950 Pro
Series enthuses can look forward to much
faster much larger m2 drives from
Samsung this new series is powered by
the Samsung Polaris controller which
other than the codename has no
relationship with AMD's Polaris graphics
architecture when compared to the 950
pro's ubx controller which featured
three cores Polaris has been beefed up
to pack five cause one of the five cores
has been dedicated to host communication
while the other four cores are use of
flash management coupled with this new
controller is Samsung's latest third
generation of V NAND flash technology
also known as 3d NAND it dramatically
increases the number of layers present
in each chip by stacking them vertically
thus increasing capacity without having
to reduce the size of the fabrication
process the 950 series use 32 layered
nan while the 960 has been bumped up to
48 layers
enabling Samsung offer the spacious 2
terabyte version with real estate at a
premium here
Samsung has employed an advanced
packaging technology known as package on
package by stacking the DRAM cache on
top of the controller Samsung has freed
up value
PCB space for for NAND flash chips
however packaging these densely together
can cause other issues one such issue
faced by the 950 Pro Series for example
was heat and heavy load the 950 Pro
Series did run a little hot forcing the
controller to scale back which
ultimately reduced performance in the
case of the new 960 pro series samsung
has taken several measures to reduce the
regularity of thermal throttling one
such step was to include a small copper
film heat spreader which is estimated by
Samsung to improve thermal performance
by around 30% also helping to address
this issue is improved power efficiency
this is probably the biggest factor at
play here these things combined should
see the 960 pro last around 50% longer
under load before throttling can be seen
lasting 50% longer is one thing it is
also worth noting that in this time the
960 pro is able to transfer almost twice
as much data so the chances of
throttling are greatly diminished
samsung claims under typical load the
two terabyte drive will consume 5.8
watts
5.3 watts for the one terabyte model and
5.1 watts for the 512 gigabyte model
those are similar ratings for the 950
pro series though of course we are
talking about a much faster drive here
so fair to say efficiency has been
improved for data security hardware
based aes 256-bit data encryption is
supported along with TCG opal while
other features such as trim garbage
collection and smart are also supported
lastly I should just note that the 960
Pro Series comes with the same five-year
warranty as the 950 pro series also the
endurance rating for the two turbo model
has been set at a massive 1,200
terabytes of written data eight hundred
terabytes have written data for the one
terabyte version and four hundred
terabytes of written data for the pokey
little 512 gigabyte model okay that all
sounds mighty impressive but how does it
really perform well let's go find out
shall we
first let's take a look at the
sequential read and write performance
with a s SS D benchmark the 960 pro
looks pretty mighty here reaching 2.7
gigabytes per second for the read and 2
gigabytes per second for the right
compared to the 950 pro this makes the
960 pro roughly 25% faster for the read
test and a little over 40 percent faster
for the
I test so impressive stuff here the 960
/ absolutely blitzed the 4k 64 thread
test and it was the right performance
that was again the most impressive
reaching almost 1.3 gigabytes per second
the 960 pro is 80 percent faster than
intel's SSD 750 series and a little over
three times fast in the 950 pro given
what we just saw I was expecting to see
slightly better access performance
especially given what the 950 pro
produced still the performance here is
solid in the 960 Pro is far from slow
using two different data sets comprised
of multiple files we measured on disk
copy of performance the game data which
features a mixture of small and large
compressed and non compressed files
allow the 960 Pro to move an incredible
1094 megabytes per second that is a
staggering 68 percent performance
improvement over the 950 pro although
the 960 pro only managed a throughput of
542 megabytes per second for the program
test which is compromised of many small
non compressed files it was still over
60 percent faster than the 950 pro ok so
the last test we're going to look at is
the large file extraction test using
7-zip here we have measured the time it
takes to complete the file extraction
along with the average transfer speed
the 950 Pro extracted the data at a rate
of 972 megabytes per second which was
28% faster the 950 pro and 91% fast and
the intel SSD 750 series it was also
almost 5 times faster than a
high-performance sadr SSD such as the
850 Pro this meant the test took just 39
seconds using the 960 Pro whereas the
best SATA SSD takes over 3 minutes
as expected Samsung's latest flagship m2
nvme SSD is fast very fast performance
wise it's a good step fall from the
previous 950 pro series though most
owners won't feel the need to rush out
an upgrade just yet as Samsung's last
season m2 drives are still very capable
on the other hand thews is looking to
build a brand new system or just in need
of a new SSD well then you're in luck as
it stands there's no better option for
those seeking maximum performance
pricing starts at three hundred and
thirty dollars for the 512 gig model and
Rises as high as $1,300 for
a two terabyte version and yes we are
talking US dollars for these MSRP s the
one turret model that I have costs a
cool 630 dollars or 61 cents per
gigabyte the exact same cost per
gigabyte as the 512 gig model of the 950
Pro at this stage our ZT pricing isn't
yet clear a direct currency conversion
places the one terabyte model at around
eight hundred thirty dollars and while
this makes sense as its roughly twice
the price as the 950 pro 512 gigabyte
model so what do you guys think is the
960 pro fast enough to justify the price
please be sure to give a thoughts and
feelings below in the comments this has
been Steve from however unboxed and
hopefully I've done a good enough job
sitting in for Matt on this one if I
have I'll see you guys next time so
those of you who already support the
channel thank you so much it's truly
appreciated and to those of you would
like to support the channel directly I
do have Amazon links and a patreon link
in the video description below thanks a
lot and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
