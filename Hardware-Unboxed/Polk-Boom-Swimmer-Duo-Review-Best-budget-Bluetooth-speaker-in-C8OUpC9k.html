now down to business
I love seeing innovative designs and the
very crowded portable bluetooth speaker
market in the original pop boom swimmer
was a real breath of fresh original air
now the swimmer is back stay mostly true
to its original clever form factor and
using the latest Bluetooth iteration to
deliver true stereo sound as far as the
swimmer is concerned portability doesn't
just translate to a small science the
clever looping tail allows some mounting
in all kinds of situations and that's
only one of its fixing options it also
comes with a suction cup attachment that
can be screwed on in place of the tail
in this evolved form of the swimmer that
clever tail is an inch longer to the
speaker itself is a small cup shape
measuring just over two and a half
inches wide if it's easily into your
hand and can slide into most pockets
easily and it's small enough to get lost
in the backpack I've been super keen to
see what kind of sounds such a small
device can pump out but we'll get to
that a bit later I really like the
design of the swimmer duo its rubberized
coating feels great to touch and hold
and also offers the speaker plenty of
protection the ultimately coloured
speaker grille bears the pop logo as
well as an attractive pattern of
different sized holes wrapped around the
bottom of the speaker lies the boom logo
an LED indicator and then the buttons
that control the device first is the
bluetooth pairing button followed by the
volume up and down and finally the power
button on the right the instruction
manual was actually quite useful with
this product there's many more functions
in the buttons first indicate the volume
plus and minus buttons can also be used
to play and pause by pressing both at
once as well as skip a track forward or
back by holding either one for two
seconds to pair to swimmers together you
simply need to hold the Bluetooth button
for three seconds on both simultaneously
and finally you can answer a call by
tapping the plus button and hang up by
holding the minus button the base of the
speak has a lot to offer too you can
choose to screw on either the long tail
the suction cup base both of which are
quite useful but I like the tail
attachment in particular while the
suction cup is okay for temporarily
fixing the speaker to smooth
offices I didn't feel immensely
confident leaving my nifty piece of tech
hanging on for too long although it's
both shockproof and waterproof so if it
falls it's most likely gonna be okay the
tail on the other hand is really awesome
as mentioned it's an inch longer this
time around and as such it's a little
more versatile with what you can wrap it
around and attach it to you're only
limited by your imagination in this
aspect and wherever I went with it I
could generally find something to wrap
it around or hook it over and if not you
can also loop something through the hole
at the base of the tail attachment
instead to charge the device or access
the three-and-a-half millimeter jack the
base needs to be removed underneath
you'll find a small rubber flap that's a
little tricky to pull out with your
fingernail I'm sure this tight fit is to
ensure the internals are protected from
water and dirt though the battery took a
little over two hours to charge from
last around eight hours playback which
is pretty great for a device so small I
feel like I wind up saying this often in
these Bluetooth speaker reviews but it's
especially true for this product the
sound it produces is pretty damn
impressive for such a tiny device I was
particularly impressed with the bass
performance which seemed to sound a
little better too with the suction cup
fitting stuff to either a wall or my
desk
the duo aspect is where the speakers
really come into their own massive fan
of the implementation this feature on
the boom swimmers ooohm with other
models have used previously they had a
similar feature you would have to use a
specific Android or iOS app to play
through two speakers at once often mean
you weren't able to use streaming apps
such as Spotify or Google Play Music and
you're instead limited to whatever
actual files had stored locally on your
device thankfully this isn't the case of
the swimmer duo you simply hold the
Bluetooth button on both devices as
mentioned and your away as far as your
phone is concerned you're connected to a
single device to media and calls awesome
the true stereo sound is good - there's
so much louder than a single speaker and
it really fills the room significantly
better as you'd expect to speakers -
over one overall I've got to say at the
Polk Brune swimmer Joe is one of the
coolest little speakers I've ever used
and seen well I didn't find the suction
cup overly useful it's a nice option to
have the tailhook base is just awesome
the design and look at the speaker is
super cool the sound is really great for
a size and the implementation of its
features is in my opinion the best in
its price range additional media
controls through the volume buttons are
extremely handy and the fact that the
Chuo function doesn't require an
additional app is a really great bonus
available for just $44 in Amazon or
around $80 in Australia I think the
swimwear duo is the best portable rugged
and waterproof speaker in its price
range by far it's clearly very well
thought-out and includes features and a
design that's well beyond its price
point what do you guys think of the
swimmers you are you tempted to grab -
