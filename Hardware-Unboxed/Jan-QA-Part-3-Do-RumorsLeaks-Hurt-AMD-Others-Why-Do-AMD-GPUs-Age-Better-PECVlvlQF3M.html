we promise part two wouldn't be that
good hopefully it wasn't alright and we
really really have the stragglers now we
joked about part two being all the the
less desirable questions to address but
we have a part three so I don't know
what that tells you but yeah now we had
a lot of questions and a lot of really
good questions so we don't like to make
these episodes run too much over 20
minute mark so yeah part three
all right next questions from you got
way too many things going any name so
I'm just going to skip it um will you be
testing a Radeon seven if so do you
think it's maybe between the 1080i and
2080 I probably based on what we know so
far again we're just guessing here so
we're sort of guessing I mean we've got
information from AMD unexpected
performance around 30 percent faster
then Vegas 64 which would certainly put
it on par at least with the 1080i
probably a little bit ahead which would
put it on power if the r-tx
2080 so yeah to answer the question yes
we'll be getting one for testing AMD is
simple definitely be getting one and not
a-- definitely you'll be getting one but
it'll be a week after the reviews go
live we'll be getting one with plenty of
time to get our review done so that's
awesome news will probably provide a
super in-depth day 1 review day 1
coverage and I think yes it will be
between the TI and RT X xx atti alright
next question you ready mm-hmm
Tim's nodding off a bit if I buy a new
GPU should I take it apart and replace
the thermal paste I've seen videos where
they say it's a good idea but what about
warranties and stuff my take on this
would be if you need to replace the
thermal paste on a brand new graphics
card
it's a rubbish graphics card I've not
seen an instance where you need to do
that I have done plenty of times because
we take it apart clean up take some beer
I'll put it back together and I do the
thermal testing beforehand then I
replace it with a really higher-quality
fella paste almost always the
temperatures are identical or within a
degree so certainly not worth
maybe there's some like budget cards you
get that have that real nasty dry
thermal paste that's not so great maybe
it makes sense there but then real
budget nasty cards or not nasty cards
but budget cards using nasty thermal
paste generally aren't super fast and
don't generate loads a heat so it'll be
a waste of time anyway probably not
worth doing it because yeah even
warranties and all that stuff aside if
you do damage the card that's just a
whole pain in the backside that you
would have had to deal with otherwise
and it's for no real gain so not worth
doing if you buy a second hand GPU and I
don't know it's one of a particular
model that maybe you go read a few
reviews watch a few videos and they're
claiming thermals are 5 degrees or more
cooler than what you're getting take
note of the ambient temperature but yeah
if you think it's running much hotter
than it should be then maybe it's worth
taking the second handcart apart
reapplying some thermal paste and see if
that improves things for you or it could
just be a whole heap of dust in the
heatsink or whatever so yeah I mean for
new cards though definitely not worth
doing okay next question GPU related is
there any difference between the rx 400
series and the rx 500 series apart from
the clock speeds in other words would
and rx 480 at one point four gigahertz
be equal to an Rx 580 at the same speed
and that's basically what the question
is the rx 500 series for the most part
with the exception of the rx 550 and the
dodgy rx 560 version that they quietly
released with the exception of those two
it's a refresh it's a Polaris refresh so
your rx 470 became the 570 and the 480
became the 580 with a factory overclock
so AMD said that it was on the new
FinFET 14 nanometer FinFET process
basically the process are just matured
so they were getting better yields and
therefore they could run at slightly
higher clock speeds but my 480 card
overclocked just as well as my 580 card
and so on and so forth with the other
ones
so yeah I mean there's no real
differences oh but sorry I just
we add in one last bit when you're
saying at the same frequency would they
be equal yes absolutely identical in
every metric all right Alex asks do you
think OLED monitors will make LCDs
obsolete when the tech improves if so
how long will this be or do you think
they'll always be a place for LCD yeah I
mean OLED right now is better in a lot
of ways in LCD the main problem is the
burning that you get so especially for a
monitor things like the taskbar any
applications that use a lot say you just
use it for Chrome things like you know
the address bar will start to burn in
overtime because the OLED you know
elements themselves degrade at different
rates depending on how often you use
them so if they can solve that and you
can get older with no burning then yeah
there'd be every reason to produce that
over LCD especially for high-end
monitors because always and more
expensive to manufacture so yeah that
would be when it would make it obsolete
how long will this be I think it's
actually not solvable for all lids I'm
not sure they can get it to a point
where burning is completely not an issue
we saw with plasmas over time back when
plasmas were a thing that you know early
models would burn in a lot more than
sort of the final generation models
would but it was still an issue for the
last models so I think there will always
be a place for LCD particularly with
technology like micro LED coming out
that basically has some of the
advantages of olives like deeper blacks
per pixel local dimming so I think
eventually that will actually supersede
all it and will get sort of better LCD
technology in the future and go from
there
all right Steve here's a question for
you from YouTube was the recent 1050 TI
vs. RX 570 video where it shows the 570
demolishing the 1050 TI a stabber din
video for not supplying with a 2060 I
saw a couple of these comments and yeah
well not having a go at this person who
asked that's a fair enough question
suppose I even addressed it in the video
because I thought at the end of it I
thought I know this is going to come up
straight after we did that RT X 2060
thing look these videos these 36 cm
benchmark videos are in the play a
planned weeks ahead of time it takes a
seriously long time a test of graphics
card at two resolutions and 36 games
like I'll sit there for like 16 hours
and just benchmark for like two or three
days in a row to do one card so it's not
like yet they shaft this with the RT X
2016 I was like that's it Tim we're
doing this comparison and then a day and
a half later it was done it took me like
a day and a half just to edit it so no
that wasn't the intention there that
video as I said was massively overdue
the last time I did that video was the
1050 TI versus the RX 470 so the 5:17 I
always compared with the 1063 gigabyte
which upset a lot of the AMD fans but
the reason I did that was very simple
they cost the same amount in fact the RX
570 was more expensive than the three
about 10 60 back when I made my
comparison so that's why I did it but
now you can get the rx 570 typically for
less than a 1050 Ti so it doesn't make
sense to compare it with something much
more expensive three about 10 60 anymore
having said that because a few people
did ask for it and I know they are
you've got a lot that $200 price bracket
that 150 to 200 ala price bracket is
very crowded nave got the 570 the 580
the 3 gigabyte 1060 snuck in there and
then you have the the gtx 1050 to I so
there's four cards sort of occupying
that zone and then a bit above it you
have the six gigabyte 1060 so I'm gonna
do a video including all of those cards
including the six gigabyte 1060 in the
next few days and then I will get our
much-delayed r-tx 2060 video out yeah no
that was not a video having a go in
video it was planned ahead of time and
it was always going to happen I haven't
done like a gtx 1050 vs. rx 560 video
for a while
those two apparently evenly matched and
you can go either way I just get
whichever ones
but yeah I haven't revisited them with
updated drivers okay I'll get to this
one as well why are some of AMD's GPUs
aging better than their in-video
counterparts good question I think
there's two reasons for this one is AMD
generally offers more vram with their
GPUs which helps them age a bit better
kind of self-defeating for AMD there
because they have to charge more for the
card or their margins are cut in two and
for quite some time the people buying
the cards and you don't really benefit
from the new VM we're going to see that
with the Radeon seven 16 gigabytes is
massive overkill right now but you can
expect it to give it an advantage over
the r-tx 2080 in three four five years
and at that point well whoever bought
the news probably looking at moving on
and then the other reason is Kota comes
under that fine wine banner which the
vram thing does as well but this one is
less impressive
it's basically sloppy drivers I said in
a question earlier AMD has been doing a
fantastic job with their drivers
recently arguably better than in video
so yeah why not so we're not seeing
those consistent gains like we were for
a while from them because they haven't
got ground and make up now they're sort
of hitting the ground running straight
out of the gate with their our GPUs now
and that ties into another question we
answered earlier I think the Radeon
seven will perform pretty well right the
baton we won't see ten or whatever
percent gains in certain titles that
have been out for a while so yeah
basically comes down to VM and Driver
development the vram thing will continue
and I think they're pretty well on top
of the the drivers at this point true
benchmarks asks us if a freesync monitor
worked with an AMD card it should work
with an Nvidia card to write or add
those screen issues in video mentions
something that can be at the driver
level that they won't fix I know in a
previous video you said that statement
by them was Bologna but for the sake of
curiosity what do you think what did you
use the word Bologna that's what's
written there and by the met bowler
who know unless something might be
something yeah we Aussies don't quite
yet
so moving on the question is if a
freesync miner worked with an AMD card
should it work with an Nvidia card -
right
assuming that Nvidia is implemented
adaptive sync properly then yes both
monitors should work exactly the same
whether it's an ambien or an Nvidia card
if Nvidia hasn't implemented it properly
for whatever reason then yes then would
be a situation where it wouldn't work on
NVIDIA cards right and that would be
entirely invidious fault for stuffing
that up are they something that is that
a driver level that they won't fix I
don't think it's a driver problem the
things that they're shown I think
they're problems with the panel's
themselves these are panels that have
just been manufactured poorly they
didn't get the adaptive sync
implementation right in the panel itself
I know there's a few LG panels that they
were showing off that were basically the
examples of things like flickering
dipping to black those sorts of things
unknown issues with those particular
monitors so I don't think that's a
freesync issue I just think that's an
issue with LG not making those morons
proper I'm not calling it LG
specifically because there's a few other
monitors as well that have those issues
but again it's not an issue with
freesync itself it's just those monitor
manufacturers doing a bad job and
personally if I ever saw those issues
with the monitor that I'd purchased I
would either take it back and get
something else or RMA it because it's
basically just a fault it shouldn't
shouldn't happen it's not inherent issue
with freesync
so yeah those are really my thoughts
with that I think in videos kind of
blown up that issue a bit to sort of
portray it as these issues issues with
all freesync monitors which definitely
is in the case so yeah okay super MX
says what is the best time of year to
consider upgrading a GPU in the
beginning or middle or in the end of the
year depends on the year it depends on
what's coming out when typically well
yeah I mean it's a tough one to answer
it depends on the year it also depends
on what you're after and what's released
so if you were waiting for an affordable
or mid-range graphics card then the end
of last year wouldn't have been worth
waiting for because we're only got $500
plus graphics cards and
yeah it just depends on what you want
like use GPUs a great now you can get
Pascal Polaris GPUs are quite cheap
quite a good discount there but you can
always wait you can always like I
wouldn't be kicking yourself if you buy
a GPU and now and then in five months
there's something that's a bit better
for a slightly better price because
you've got five months of fun gaming in
and you'll get many more in science I
did a video recently about why now is a
good time for gamers to build a gaming
PC and I talked about the fact that
there's always something new coming and
if you know if we know that say we knew
that Navi was coming in a month and it
was suspected to offer a 20% performance
boost over what we have now for the same
price then that would be worth waiting
for
but right now we don't have that
information so you just got to gauge
what informations available the time and
what we're expecting and be careful to
read too much into rumors and things
like that try to get confirmed
information interesting question here do
you think these rumors are killing AMD's
progress personally seeing this kind of
practice in online media and forums just
for AMD okay so thinks it's what he's
saying is the rumors are mostly focused
on AMD product launches and that makes
people's expectation way too high but if
a product doesn't deliver as the rumor
suggests are those so-called fans aim D
fans kill themselves fairly extreme I I
don't see rumors for Intel for their
upcoming tend ohmmeter products yeah
that much pretty heavily memed on
can we stop these rumor and practices
okay
well I assume this is all in relation to
Tim's sort of D railing of the hype
train for CES all right yeah so you two
really really really wanted to avoid
talking about this because he has not
enjoyed it one bit which is he didn't
touch up the 20-foot pole seems people
can be quite ridiculous about these
things and I guess this is sort of what
this questions about well alright I know
Tim doesn't really want to talk about
this kind of stuff much so I'll talk
about it Tim can quietly sit there in
pain
yeah yeah okay so we got some we've got
some rumors about what AMD's lineup was
going to be for The Horizon 3000 series
we said they look too good to be true in
some ways that was taken out of context
like it looked too good to be true for
one they'll being announced say yes that
seemed far too good to be true
and I'm unreasonable unrealistic what
you were getting for the prices in the
current market seemed unlikely and then
it wasn't just like Tim Tim wasn't
saying you're not getting 16 cause
that's too good to be true that wasn't
what he was saying at all he wasn't
focused on any one thing
it was the package deal that seemed too
good to be true so I guess one way to
put this for people who don't quite get
the question all and I'll just given an
example so let's say there were no
rumors at all there was just guys
talking in forums dreaming and stuff and
there was no speculation video put out
there nothing that got everyone talking
about and everyone reported on us this
is what's happening at CES say there was
none of that and AMD came out at CES and
did exactly what they did which was
shown eight core part with better
efficiency than the 1990 a matching the
performance of the 99er okay albeit and
Cinebench we don't really know gaming
numbers and stuff yet but that in itself
is very very impressive now they had to
come out and shown that in productivity
they can match the 99 or okay or
slightly beat it and under and clock
speeds that may get better than that the
same amount of cause that's huge I would
have walked away from that like blown
away which I'll still was anyway but I
think everyone just about everyone would
have walked away from that pretty blown
away they'll be there would have been
some people saying oh you know Amy's
gone to seven nanometers and they can
only just match Intel on 14 that's all a
bit silly because they didn't just do
that the efficiency was much better so
it was impressive and I think everyone
would have walked away from that
impressed
now if the rumour had had been accurate
and it had have been at CES AMD will
reveal teaser product an eight-core
product that can
Intel Core four core simp similar
frequency or whatever and it will match
it in performance and be more efficient
I think everyone be like whoa that's
that seems awesome not too good to be
true but that seems awesome and I'll
believe it when I see it
and then we see the demo and we're like
holy crap that's amazing so it was hyped
up in a way that it delivered I think
that's the best way to heart something
up in a way that delivers except ever I
was expecting a whole slew of Horizon
3000 processors with potentially pricing
specifications core count all that and
they're expecting a 16 core part to be
unveiled and just absolutely annihilate
the 900k and don't tell me they weren't
expecting that because every single
youtuber basically that parroted the
leak was like Intel's dooms you saw the
headlines and that's what AMD fanboys
wanted us to do was make a video about
how doomed Intel is which still may be
the case in the way that they think it's
going to happen and we know the 16 core
part is possible it's very possible but
that doesn't mean AMD should do it right
now and doesn't mean they will so we
have to they're going to read the market
conditions they're going to play things
the way they were going to play them
basically they know what they can do
they know what they have at their
disposal that they know and they will
execute in whatever way is best for them
and coming out right now the 16 core
part which they were suggested to do at
CES would have been a terrible move
because it neuters your thread Ripper
sales it kills your eyes and second
generation sales who's going to buy an
eighth the 2700 X or any of those parts
who's going to buy the six core parts
when we're getting a better six core
part for next to nothing so it would
have just effectively killed rise and
sales a lot of killed thread Ripper
sales so they were never ever ever going
to do that it was never going to happen
and we knew it was never gonna happen
for a few reasons
and Tim put them in a video foolishly
and Coptic endless hate for trying to
tell the truth I don't whine but Tim
never said that 16 cause wasn't possible
or wasn't going to happen yeah and I
think the question here was do those
rumors potentially harm a MDM yeah and I
think
it's possible it is because you think
it's definitely well does way more bad
than good
yeah gives you height for a product that
you know they didn't show and
potentially doesn't exist they were a
lot a lot of comments on our YouTube you
I am the undelivered again yeah under
Julia yeah Amy fails this and that way
think this is amazing you look at the
tech and you go yeah okay that's
actually a pretty significant step
forward considering how far behind a
2700 X is compared to now Andrew K then
the neck very next generation they have
matched that on performance and done it
at a much lower power that's very
impressive
but because people are expecting 16
calls to be unveiled right there and
then that people like oh well they
didn't show a 16 core part so that's not
what I was expecting that's not that's
not as impressive yep so yeah I think
these weeks do have an impact on these
companies and their launch plans and I
think that you know internally am do you
might not been too happy with some of
those things but it still just AMD like
we've seen that from time to time with
invidious leaks as well last year a lot
of people even with that leaks you know
people were sort of getting hyped up for
you know this major unveil of things and
you know you could see videos pretty
much every week of people sort of
speculating and guessing and leaking
information about what those cards would
be and that turns out that you know
while the 2080 I is you know faster that
you know the cards weren't as good value
for money as people were expecting from
some of that information yeah it happens
all the time every it's a difficult
position for us because we personally
don't like the leaks and rumors at all
but we get why you guys the enthusiasts
are interested in them get excited about
them and like to discuss them and I
think haven't having a healthy
discussion about this stuff is perfectly
fine but when someone says one thing and
then you know we got information and we
were told exactly what would be in the
keynote and what would be announced and
what would be teased and what would be
shown and when we sort of go home guys
like we had a lot of viewers asking us
for our opinion on this and we knew the
answer we couldn't say who told us or
how are you but we could just say well
temper your expectations because this
ain't happening
and then Tim got tons of hate for that
so we're well we've worked we've learnt
a lot from it rather than sort of dig
into these rumors and sort of prove
aspects of them right or wrong we're
just going to give our opinions that we
think is going to happen I think it's
probably the best way to go that you're
different
whether we make or not who knows but or
yeah you know share information relating
to these rumors and everything yeah
we're not sure but certainly we will
doing a bit of a different way I think
yeah we've definitely learned from it
and we will tackle it in a slightly
different way it's kind of annoying that
we have to I don't think that Tim did
anything wrong but just from the
reaction it was just something that we
didn't really want to deal with you know
so that's that
okay thank you for watching I am gonna
wrap this up real quick because my arms
are starting to stick to the table I'm
over it
done too long with the Q&amp;amp;A too hot but
yeah thank you for everyone who
submitted a question we had it yeah like
I said about over 300 I think it was
yeah and to really really call them down
this time which was yeah yeah even then
we've still got three parts yeah very
good so thank you again feel free to
like feel free to subscribe so you can
subscribe to patreon yes there and yeah
that's going to do it this one so I'm
your host Steve I'm use to me even
though I never say that in my videos
I'll see you the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
