Computex 2017 coverage today I checked
out the msi booth and found some very
impressive looking motherboards before
we get to that though a big THANK YOU to
msi for making it possible for me to
attend the event this year if you're in
the market for new Intel motherboard
check out their x99 z2 70 and h2 70
motherboards right now MSI is offering a
free you play game key for any new
purchase link is in the video
description MSI promise that have some
cool new products for me to check out so
without wasting any time today I made a
beeline for their booth and what an
impressive display I found I spent over
an hour checking out the harbour on
display and honestly I don't think I
managed to film everything there that
said what I did manage to film with some
very impressive shiny new motherboards
dotting the yet to be released
Intel X 299 chipset the first board I
happened upon was the X 299 gaming Pro
carbon ACC like all X 299 board that
will feature full support for Intel's
Core X series of processors which
includes an 18 core sky like X processor
as well as KB Lake X quad cores as you
can see the gaming Pro carbon a/c
features a mostly black design with a
few silver highlights look very nice and
this means it should suit most builds
very well the board was surprisingly
light on cooling no particularly given
it includes a 10 plus one plus one power
phase design offering features such as
load line calibration and MSI's turbo
socket the CPU is also fed additional
power via an 8 pin plus a 4 pin power
connector so I imagine will be more than
enough power delivery for maximum
overclocking Headroom there's no
shortage of Tim slots either in total
there's 8 ddr4 dimm slots allowing for a
maximum memory capacity of 128 gigabyte
there's a reasonable amount of storage
options as well in total I spotted 8
SATA 6 gigabits per second ports are u
dot 2 port and a pair of em 2 slots of
course there's a lot more to talk about
but I'll save that for the official
review before moving on though I did
find another X 299 gaming Pro carbon AC
board and this one was fitted with a
very impressive looking water block from
ek
the idea here was to design a block that
ties in with the motherboard design
rather than create a more traditional
looking square or rectangular water
block so ek is created an aggressive
looking water block for mo size X 299
boards and I have to say it does the
board justice the small port window is
also very cool as well anyway it's a
really cool looking motherboard and I'm
very keen to get my hands on one for a
review soon so take the hint MSI hey
let's move on and see what else we could
find there were some other exciting
looking MSI X 299 boards as well such as
the X power gaming AC and tomahawk
alongside those boards I also spotted
the new Z 270 godlike gaming and that's
a seriously beefy looking Z 270 board
for those of you interested in something
that's still very flashy but much more
affordable
the be 350 tomahawk Arctic may be of
interest this board would be a great
pairing with the risin 5 1600 priced at
120 dollars u.s. it's certainly one of
the pricier be 350 boards but hey just
look at the thing if you're wondering
what the tomahawk Arctic looks like Anna
build and check this out here we have a
fantastic white theme to build
supporting the Rison v 1600 processor 32
gigabytes of hyper X white memory and
MSI's rx 580 a graphics card displaying
all this hardware was a modified in win
303 and what an eye-catching build it
was but hey if why it's not your thing
then perhaps a PC that blends in with a
more temperate climate will entice that
is assuming your game outside here we
have a system featuring MSI's new camera
themed hardware on display is these ed
270 camera squad motherboard and GTX
1060 cameras quad graphics card like all
things it won't appeal to everyone but I
thought it made for a pretty unique
looking gaming system getting back to
the AMD AM for hardware I came across
the X 370 gaming Pro carbon AC which is
a relatively new model supporting
wireless AC networking support out of
the box but before I got a chance to
have a closer look at the board and
check out that wireless AC module my msi
contact shuffled me along to this board
now what we have here is a brand new
motherboard the x3
70 gaming m7 this board utilizes a
dedicated clock generator along with
ddr4 boost and game boost MSI tells me
that these features maximize the board's
overclocking potential allowing for
higher CPU and memory over clocks
something that really caught my eye was
a strange-looking heatsink on the bottom
of the board to me it look like it was
covering the m2 slots so was this some
kind of upgraded m2 shield well it turns
out that's exactly what it is once you
remove the pair of M 2 screws the
heatsink seems to lever up on what must
be a hinge and this allows the user to
install one or two m2 drives in what msi
calls the twin turbo m2 ports once the
drives are slotted into place the
heatsink simply clamps down on top of
them MSI claims this improves thermal
performance and protects against EMI
interference
once again I'm pretty keen to put their
claims to the test on a final note that
board is built with military Class six
components and uses an enhanced 13 phase
power design so yeah should be an
overclocking powerhouse overall MSI's
new X 370 gaming Pro carbon a/c looks
great and well you can add that to the
growing list of new products I want to
review when I get back from Computex
well it's been a busy down the showroom
floor and this is just a small sample of
what I've seen so far so expect much
more coverage MSI also had some really
cool desktop systems and graphics cards
on display but I'll feature them in a
separate video soon I wanted to get at
least one video online today for you
guys to enjoy I also checked out a
massive range of new and exciting
products from Aero cool as well as some
affordable new cases and cooling
products from deep cool so keep on out
for those videos as well as it is I'll
end up editing quite late tonight but I
hope to hit the showroom floor again
tomorrow after a bit of a sleep in all
right guys that's going to do it for
this one I'm your host Steve hope you
enjoying the coverage so far and I'll
see you again soon
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
