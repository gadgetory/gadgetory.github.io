familiar with the GeForce GTX to know
each AI and you know what it's all about
in terms of performance
I personally looked at multiple versions
here on the harbour unbox channel but
this new MSI Lightning Z version is by
far the biggest beefiest slot bendy
monster I've come across yet
like most behemoths we've come across
this thing will hug through expansion
slots but that is fairly typical and we
did see this with gigabytes or ass
extreme edition model however whereas
the Auris card tipped the scales at
fourteen hundred and sixty grams and for
that I called it a porker the Lightning
Z takes things to the next level at
sixteen hundred and seventy five grams
that's almost 1.7 kilos so needless to
say it's an incredibly big heavy
graphics card in terms of dimensions the
thing measures three hundred and twenty
millimeters long 140 millimeters tall
and 61 millimeters thick before getting
to the benchmark let's quickly tear down
the card and take a look at the design
also please note for this video I'm
going to be focusing most of my
attention on the thermal performance and
overclocking since these are the two
main points of interest for me with this
graphics card I assume it's probably the
same for most of you as well right soft
with the backplate first I have to say
the backplate on the Lightning's it
actually looks very impressive
I like the cutout vents the Lightning
branding with the RGB backlighting and a
copper heat pipe poking through those
few vents once off we can see the
backside of the plate now it does in
fact feature a flat copper heat pipe
running from end to end
towards the middle of the pipe a bit
off-center we find a thermal pad
actually a pair of thermal pads though
just one of them is on the heat pipe
these thermal pads are located over the
backside of the GPU so they're intended
to extract any built-up heat on the back
side of the PCB that leaks through from
the GPU but cut the heat pipe then
disperses this heat across the backplate
so it doesn't get built up it's an
interesting design I'm keen to try and
run the card with and without the
backplate to see what kind of difference
it does make next the massive heatsink
comes off in this section of the card
accounts for nine hundred and ninety-one
grams of
cards total weight here we find a large
nickel-plated copper base which comes in
direct contact with half a dozen
nickel-plated copper heat pipes in total
there are two eight millimeter pipes and
four six millimeter pipes MSI calls this
their super pipe design basically these
heat pipes are used to maximize heat
extraction from the base and spread
through the massive array of fins
cooling those fins are three stalks 2.0
fans the other two fans measure 100
millimeters in diameter while the center
fan is slightly smaller at 85
millimeters the fans feature a unique
blade design and double ball bearings
finally the last line of cooling Armour
is a thick base plate which directly
cools the memory and MOSFETs
there are also some unique looking fin
designs on the base plate or the heat
spreader if you will and again these are
designed to maximize the cooling
performance by increasing the surface
area and we even find another heat pipe
here
now we've worked our way to the PCB
where we find a few interesting things
the highlight here is the power delivery
design which sees 14 phases for the GPU
and three phases for the gddr5 X memory
there's also an insane tree of eight pin
PCIe power connectors each capable of
delivering up to 150 watts of power
input allowing overclockers to carefully
monitor the card's vitals are a series
of temperature probes covering things
such as the GPU memory and VRM these
probes can be monitored using msi
afterburner utility overclocking is
obviously what the cards all about and
included is an Allen to modes which
making this the perfect gtx 1080i for
breaking World Records msi says the ln2
mode apparently lets overclockers remove
things such as
power current and thermal limits and
this essentially means they don't need
to go and hard modify the cards for
themselves this is a feature MSI talked
quite a bit about at Computex
a few months ago now but in all honesty
it really means nothing for the vast
majority of people looking at buying a
lightning Z graphics card what I want to
know is how old is this crap his card
overclocked without having to flick it
over to the lm-2 mode after heading down
to your local convenience store for some
liquid nitrogen before we get to our
customer overclocking though what kind
of overclock has MSI applied from
factory honestly there have been
extremely conservative here per tick
given nothing else about the card is
even remotely conservative by default
the card runs at a base clock speed of
just fifteen hundred and eighty-two
megahertz granted that's roughly a
hundred megahertz over the Nvidia
default spec it's nothing we haven't
seen before in fact gigabyte went
slightly higher with their extreme
edition hitting sixteen hundred and
seven megahertz so out of the box the
GTX ten ATT whitening Z won't be blowing
any socks off in terms of fps
performance that said I do expect the
temperatures to be very low and the
operating volume to be even lower so
let's go take a look the first thing I
wanted to do before messing around with
settings and msi afterburner utility was
to see how hot the card ran in stock
out-of-the-box configuration so to do
just that I fired up the demanding and
still incredibly good-looking Crysis 3
of course with the lightning z version
of the GTX 280 at our disposal I didn't
mess around the resolution was cranked
up to 4k and the quality preset was
maxed out this allowed for a minimum of
49 FPS with an average of almost 60 fps
so not bad given the quality settings
what I was keeping it on here was the
GPU temperature and impressively it
never rose above 65 degrees we hit this
temperature at a fan speed of 1,250 rpm
which I would describe as silent
especially once the card is inside a PC
case after another hour of gameplay the
RPM did eventually hit 1300 rpm which it
didn't make any noticeable difference to
the operating volume this is an
impressive result especially given the
Auris gtx 1080i which did hit the same
temperature but it did so with its fans
spinning at 2,250 rpm while pallets
equally large super jet stream was only
a degree cooler at a much more audible
2200 rpm stock though the palette card
was much quieter though here it did
target 74 degrees so when it comes to
operating temperatures the msi lightning
Z is without question one of the best
gtx 1082 eyes on the market though
that's hardly a surprise given its size
expect other high-end models such as the
asou Strix or ms is own gaming ex for
example to run quite a few degrees
warmer one thing all aftermarket cards
have in common though is their ability
to run significantly cooler certain
videos own Founders edition model which
targets 84 degrees right so the next
step was to a little tinkering
and see just how fast we can make a
lightning Z so this I unlocked the core
voltage option in the MSI Afterburner
software cranked it up to plus 100 and
then maxed out the power and temp
sliders as well this allowed for a base
clock of sixteen hundred and fifty-one
megahertz which sir a GPU boost 3.0
frequency of over to do.you hats
at all times the gddr5 X memory also
accepted a frequency of six thousand one
hundred and fifty eight megahertz
resulting in a throughput of twelve
point three gigabits per second jumping
back into Crysis 3 the core clock speed
set for the most part at two thousand
and twenty five megahertz which sadly
isn't quite as high as the two thousand
and fifty megahertz the Auris extreme
gaming managed that said the card did
still only hit 65 degrees occasionally
peaking at 66 degrees for a second or so
before returning to 65 degrees I played
around with the fan speed profile and
found you could still maintain virtual
silence with the card overclock and
running at around 55 degrees then with a
fan speed maxed out for those of you who
play with headphones for example the
card hit just 47 degrees and frame rates
when our much closer to 60 fps for the
most part and the card seemed to hold an
operating frequency now 2015 megahertz
in Crysis 3 I also gave battlefield one
a shot for a few rounds and never saw
the GPU temp exceed 45 degrees again the
fan speed was still at a hundred percent
I wouldn't say the fan was ridiculously
loud either at that speed I should also
note that the vrm temps were also very
low of course we are running the fan at
full speed but still the temps maxed out
at just 56 degrees overclocked using the
default fan profile aver I'm did touch
on 80 degrees at times but even then
that's very manageable and well within
safe operating parameters much the same
we're seen when testing with dirt for
the GPU maxed out just 45 degrees this
time the VRMs have only just exceeded 50
degrees so overall things were running
very cool indeed before wrapping up the
temperature testing I webs out the
digital thermometer to see how hot
things got behind the GPU that is the
back side of the PCB with and without
the backplate installed so this test I
left the overclock in place but went
back to the auto fan speed profile so
this meant the GPU was running at 65
degrees with
out the back plate installed the PCB
behind the GPU measured in at 59 degrees
after about 20 minutes of gameplay in
Crysis 3 and this seemed about right
given the GPU was running at 65 degrees
with that massive heatsink on top of it
now with the back plate installed the
digital thermometer was now reporting a
maximum temperature of just 48 degrees
again after 20 minutes of Crysis 3 has a
massive 11 degree reduction in
temperature and I have to admit I wasn't
expecting to see improvement anything
like that unfortunately I did run out of
time I wasn't able to conduct further
testing msi really put me under the pump
with this one the turnaround time was
quite brutal so I am very keen to see
what others find wrapping up the testing
let's take a look at a few graphs
although I've already shown some
gameplay footage and performance here is
a look at how the msi gtx 1080i
lightning Z compared to the Auris and
found Edition models in battlefield 1 at
4k disappointingly in this title of
lightning Z was a frame or two slower
than the Extreme Edition and that's both
stock and with our custom overclock the
lightning Z pretty much matches the
extreme gaming in Far Cry primal so
pretty typical performance then for an
overclocked GT x 1080 TI finally we find
much the same when testing with Franta
again the 4k resolution was used but
there's not really much else to say here
so let's move on as you no doubt aware
by this point the lightning Z is a real
slab of a graphics card but unlike say
pallet super jet stream it does have
some flair about it front on the
graphics card looks very nice the
backplate looks great as I've already
said and I have to admit I love the RGB
lighting on this thing I'm generally not
a huge fan of RGB lighting I can
appreciate it when it's done well and I
have to admit it looks very awesome on
the Lightning's II take G skills RGB
memory for example that stuff looks
great
and when complemented with the lightning
Z which gives a similar effect you have
an amazing looking combo by default you
do get an RGB rainbow effect which is
very fancy however using the mystic
light software you can really transform
the cards look and have it match your
build there are heaps of cool effects to
choose from and you can also adjust the
speed and brightness as well there's
also 7 lighting zones that can be custom
and overall the software seems to work
very well it is a bit annoying though
that the software must be loaded each
time on startup for the color profile to
be loaded okay so it's time to wrap
things up what do I think of the msi gtx
1080 TI lightning zee it's a well built
graphics card design wise i see no flaws
and the build quality is excellent
having said that though weight might be
a concern i certainly wouldn't recommend
transporting a pc with this thing
installed sitting at my desk i didn't
see any signs that would damage a PCI
Express slot when mounted horizontally
but a decent bump like if you're driving
over a pothole with this thing in your
boot of your car that could be a real
issue that aside though the card looks
amazing runs very cool and performance
as well as any air-cooled GTX and ETI is
going to and from what I can tell the
backplate is more than just a fancy
sheet of aluminium with a cool-looking
RGB white strip the only problem with
these extreme GTX to neeti eyes is that
they don't really overclock any better
than a base model card at least when
using the stock air cooler or even a
liquid cooler for that matter the
Lightning's ii is however able to run
very cool and overclocked so that's
something in short do I like the
Lightning's II absolutely is it one of
the best gtx 280 eyes I've seen today
100% would I own it
well that all depends on who's paying
for it now doesn't it the gtx 980ti has
an MSRP of $700 us and you can purchase
certain models for that price right now
the more serious cards such as MSI
gaming or gigabytes or as Extreme
Edition cost a bit more at 780 dollars
u.s. then we have the EVGA hybrid gaming
and the gigabyte Oris extreme water
force other all-in-one liquid cooled
models and they sell for a little over
$800 the msi Lightning Z though well met
things going to make your eyes water as
it currently comes at an asking price of
870 dollars us here in Australia you can
pick up a GTX 1080i for a an asking
price of about a thousand 1100 ozzie of
the horse GTX 1080i extreme for example
that cost
$550 which my opinion is getting a
little bit pricey though sitting next to
the lightning Z it's a veritable bug and
down under the MSI monster starts at
$1500 and I'm not sure what else to add
to that really so on that note I'm going
to end this review by saying the msi gtx
980ti lightnings it is a superb graphics
card with an absurd asking price if you
