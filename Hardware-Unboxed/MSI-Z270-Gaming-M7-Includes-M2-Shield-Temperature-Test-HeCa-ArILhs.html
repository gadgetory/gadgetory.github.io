i have the new MSI's dead 270 gaming m7
motherboard on hand and I'm pretty
excited about it because this is my
first msi 200 series motherboard and it
looks to be a real weapon part of the
excitement is down to the fact that the
msi is dead 170 a gaming m7 just so
happen to be one of the best value
high-end is ed 170 motherboards I laid
my hands on back in its heyday this said
170 motherboard retailed for I believe
was around 210 u.s. or 320 ozzie and the
now updated then 270 version is selling
for 240 US or 400 Ozzy making it a good
bit more expensive
well when compared to the previous model
you do get quite a lot of extras the CPU
and ddr4 memory now features a digital
PWM there is an extra m2 slot AS media
lightning USB 3.1 7 controllable sound
headers compared to the previous two
upgraded audio and u2 connectivity there
are other upgrades as well so let's get
on with it
like all new motherboards priced over
$150 u.s. this thing has enough RGB LED
lights to put your Christmas tree to
shame there pretty much everywhere and
unfortunately though a lot of this
aesthetic goodness I feel comes at the
expense of performance take the 11 phase
power solution for example like most
motherboards the power delivery system
is cool via large passive heat sinks to
ensure optimal operating temperatures
under full load that's great in MSI's
military class 5 implementation features
fancy-pants titanium chokes dark caps
and all that good stuff however the
issue I have with this implementation is
that those nice big passive heat sinks
designed to keep the power delivery
stuff cool even when overclocking has
been covered or almost insulated in
plastic these passive heat sinks rely on
air movement generated by case fans to
keep them cool covering their entire
surface area and plastic seems somewhat
counterproductive it's a bit
disappointing to see form take priority
of a function here and especially on
such a high-end motherboard I decided to
check how much of an impact the plastic
shroud had on thermal performance with a
120 millimeter fan blowing air over the
motherboard the heatsink covering the
reach a temperature of 46 degrees
Celsius this temperature is recorded
using a non-contact infrared thermometer
the core i5 7600 K processor was also
overclocked to four point eight
gigahertz and placed on the full load
during this test so honestly a heat sink
temperature of 46 degrees isn't exactly
extreme I also measured the top of the
titanium chokes at 40 degrees removing
the plastic shroud and retesting so the
heat sink temperature 40 degrees the
chokes also drop from 40 degrees down to
37 degrees these are fairly significant
temperatures despite the fact that with
the shroud installed I wouldn't have
called the original figures dangerous
still the point of these high end
enthusiast grade motherboards is that
they come with the very best components
that are meant to offer greater
efficiency and therefore crucially lower
operating temperatures so again covering
them plastic seems to go against
everything this boards cancel thankfully
the heatsink cooling the said 270 chip
isn't also covered in plastic and
instead MSI has gone with an aluminium
shroud to house the LED lighting here
and the maximum system load this
heatsink reaches 34 degrees by the way
for those wondering the ambient room
temperature was just 21 degrees during
his testing so the plastic shroud could
become a bigger issue in warmer climates
the last of the RGB LED madness can be
found around the PCI expansion slots
here MSI has instilled what they call
matching gaming i/o and audio cover with
RGB LEDs the blinky doesn't seem to be
hurting anyone so I don't have a problem
with this light show an interesting
feature that upon first inspection I
thought hey that's pretty cool
is MSI's m2 shield MSI advertise this is
a device for keeping your m2 SSD cool
while also protecting it MSI says that
and I quote the m2 shield features
cooling pads to lower the temperature of
your m2 device and avoid any possible
throttling causing it to slow down
sounds simple enough and it sounds
pretty good however there are a few
glaring issues here firstly the heat
shield as they call it only makes
contact with the top side of the SSD so
for double-sided m2 SSD C's isn't
particularly useful though admittedly
the controller is usually found on the
top side the included thermal pad
appears woefully insufficient and it's
at this point you realize this might be
more
gimmick than anything else we're still
luscious locks Steve over at gamers
Nexus looked into the m2 shield and did
some really nice testing he found that
it actually increases the operating
temperature of MDOT two drives so it
seems like the m2 shield might just trap
heat and limit the air flow to your SSD
so that's unfortunate
after speaking with msi about this issue
they insisted that their internal
testing shows improved SSD thermals and
they were quick to point out that other
reviews such as the one over a bit tech
also found significant temperature
improvements with the m2 shield in fact
bit tech reported a 10 degree lower
operating tempo on their Samsung SSD 960
Evo with the shield installed and that's
pretty amazing so with that I had to
look into this further since bit Tech
used the Samsung SSD 960 Evo 500
gigabyte I thought I might as well do
the same on an open-air chest there with
no direct airflow so we are relying
purely on natural convection without the
shield installed the Evo got us hot at
71 degrees with the shield installed we
sadly didn't see temperatures drop by 10
degrees rather just a single degree
still it didn't make the SSD hotter like
the gamers Nexus results suggested that
said I ran a second test inside a
computer case with a fan directing air
flow past the graphics card and this was
sending some cool air the 960 gyros Way
operating temperatures were reduced
significantly the SSD was now peaking at
just 47 degrees with the shield removed
installing the shield under the same
conditions actually increase the
operating temperature to 49 degrees a
two degree increase and this is similar
to what Steve over at gammas Nexus or so
it seems when there is little to no
airflow the M 2 shield might be useful
or at least it doesn't hurt however with
a small amount of airflow the M 2 shield
seems to hurt thermal performance if
only slightly
ok so I'll admit this is all sounding a
bit negative so far but that's because
I'm waiting to get to the good stuff
which thankfully is pretty much
everything else with the M 2 shields
being a bit of a bust I recommend
removing it which thankfully can be done
quickly and easily in total there are
three m2 ports all offering pcie 3.0
times for bandwidth the first flight
situated up the primary PCIe x 16 slot
supports up to 110 millimeter long and
got 2 devices while the following two
ports will accept up to 80 millimeter
long
apart from the 3m to swatch you get the
standard 6 SATA 6 gigabits per second
ports along with a u2 connector MSI has
wrapped this connector with their steel
armor which is meant to increase
durability and reduce interference it
probably doesn't hurt that it looks kind
of cool as well
anyway this connector should come in
handy for those connecting
next-generation SSDs as it delivers up
to 32 gigabits per second of bandwidth
per device moving on from storage to
audio we find MSI's audio boost solution
whereas asrock employs creative Sound
Blaster cinema 3 software MSI is going
with nahee mix audio software cinema 3
worked well when I tested the asrock
fatalities at 270 gaming ITX motherboard
so I was keen to see how no hemic 2
compared sadly I never got the chance
the software simply wouldn't install
although the audio was working and the
latest real tech drivers were installed
as an anemic software install failed
claiming that the realtek audio driver
must be installed first so following a
tutorial in the new hemic forums are
used in uninstaller from iobit and
removed the real tech drivers then after
rebooting installing the real tech audio
drivers supplied by MSI I tried again
unfortunately this was to no avail as I
ran into the same error once again at
this point I tried a few other things
before giving up and moving on
it seems I'm not alone here either heaps
of MSI users are reporting trouble
getting their software installed there
is also a concerning amount of users who
have successfully installed the software
but climate causes our games to crash so
for now this doesn't look great for the
no hemic to software and I'll have to
look into this a bit later moving past
that disappoint we find that like as
rocks higher ends at 270 motherboards
MSO has isolated the audio Hardware on a
separate section of the PCB to avoid
interference they've also placed the
left and right audio channels on a
separate layer to reduce crosstalk
something rather unique and very odd
about MSI audio implementation is the
fact that it employs not one but two
Realtek a LC 1220 codecs moreover each
audio codec receive its own dedicated
amplifier so why is MSI dumbness as far
as I can tell this has been done so that
the user can simultaneously use their
speakers and headphones which is kind of
cool when it comes to USB 3 connectivity
these n270 gaming m7 delivers the i/o
panel supports a pair of USB 3
point one Jen to parts a type a and type
C port along with a pair of Jen ones
I've a ports for legacy support MSI has
included three rinky-dinky USB 2.0 ports
as well meanwhile I on board has it's
possible to add another four USB 2.0
ports two USB 3.1 ports and a single Gen
2 3.1 type C port I should note this
board doesn't use an Intel Thunderbolt
controller so sunder bolts three support
doesn't exist even MSI's USB
implementation gets a special touch up
from the marketing guys the two USB 3.1
gen2 on type a ports featured below the
Gigabit Ethernet port of V are ready we
are ready USB ports okay I'm starting to
get dizzy at this point connected to the
USB port is the VR boost chip msi claims
that traditional USB ports can suffer
signal drops significantly impacting the
performance of connected devices msi
also says that vr boosters are smart
chip them ensures a clean and strong
signal to the VR optimized USB ports
giving you an enjoyable VR experience
this is yet another feature we can't
really test so I guess we'll just have
to take their word for it also around
the i/o panel we find a single ps2 port
which we could happily drop in favor of
some extra USB 3 ports there's a CMOS
reset button DisplayPort and HDMI
outputs gear bit Ethernet connection
which is driven by a killer a 2500
controller and five audio jacks along
with an optical audio output as well so
that pretty much covers all the
important features let's take a look at
the UEFI BIOS for those of you wondering
this is a single BIOS job using a 128
megabit american megatrends UEFI BIOS
flash rom as we found when testing new
asrock z2 70 motherboards msi has also
gone with a very similar design layouts
that are there's at 170 models also like
the asrock boards MSI is now at an easy
bias mode which probably isn't necessary
on the enthusiast grade motherboard but
we have it anyway skipping the easy bias
mode lands us in the advanced bias and
now we can get things done as you might
have guessed all the real action takes
place in the OC menu now we could just
bump the CPU ratio up to 49 times and
then add a little voltage like we did on
a drop-dead 270 Mini ITX board but for
this review let's try an msi feature
called gain boost which is
essentially automated overclocking game
boos can be enabled at the BIOS level
and typically this is how I prefer to do
my overclocking but surprising this
feature doesn't provide much information
on what it's actually doing here for far
better control and information it's best
to install and use the msi command
center within windows I have to admit
while not a fan of overclocking and
tweaking within the Windows operating
system the msi command center is
brilliant the level of control that it
offers is impressive and users can
Turing their CPU DRAM and even
integrated graphics processor if they
wish the game Bruce menu provides more
detail on what it is that each setting
does with the core i5 7600 K and still
we have seven overclocking profiles that
are oddly numbered anyway each one steps
up the operating frequency by 100
megahertz my core i5 7600 K processor
failed the set eleven option which would
have seen it run at 4.9 gigahertz that
said the set 10 option works fine and
here the processors seem to operate it
between 4.7 and 4.8 gigahertz depending
on the load stability was excellent
though temperatures were high as this
setting applies one point 4 volts my
7600 Kage can run happily at 4.9
gigahertz using 1.3 volts so while the
game Bruce feature does work well you
are still best off fine-tuning the
overclock complimenting the command
center is the little MSI gaming app
which can be used to overclock your MSI
graphics card as well as tinker with the
LED lights
sadly the lighting options for the z2 70
gaming m7 are very basic which are seven
color choices and some boring effects so
the RGB lighting options and effects do
leave quite a bit to be desired
overall the MSI z2 70 gaming m7 is a
great motherboard despite the few
frustrating design flaws on that note I
have to say the marketing gimmicks or
jargon or whatever you want to call it
have gotten out of hand
have with the motherboard makers lately
and only added bling these days has made
it probably a bit harder to swallow or
at least take them seriously but let me
be clear I'm not singling MSI out here
they all do it I guess I'm just
disappointed that MSI has compromised on
cooling to look cool I should point out
though that asrock has also included
some a plastic shroud stuff over there
vrm heat sinks on the edge 270 extremes
for and then 270 gaming k-6 boards
though they
haven't covered them entirely so there
they are still getting a fair bit of
airflow and on the higher end gaming k-6
model they have used heat pipe to join
the heat sinks together which has
improved the thermal performance
actually it's interesting to think that
ten years ago copper heat pipes are all
the rage amongst motherboard makers
I remember boards such as the asou speak
a deluxe which were littered with heat
pipes the older viewers models to
remember a bit their IP 35 pro was
another Intel P 35 motherboard with an
interesting cooling stuff that took full
advantage of heat pipes back in the day
the heat pipe craze did get a little out
of hand thanks to the marketing machine
but for the most part they did help with
thermal performance so enthusiasts
welcome to them fast-forward to today
and it's all about flashy lights
honestly I don't really mind the RGB
craze that much and I have to admit the
MSI z2 70 gaming m7 is a very cool
looking motherboard certainly one of the
best I've seen I just wish the bling
didn't come at the expense of cooling
performance maybe I'm banging on about
this too much the temperatures certainly
never got out of hand and they didn't
compromise the stability of our core i5
7600 overclock I guess I just like to
see well refined designs with a highly
optimized for thermal performance the m2
shield is another pointless gimmick but
you can just use one of the other M 2
slots and leave it in place if you think
it looks cool of course if you wish to
install three m2 SSDs then you can
simply remove the shield altogether so
no hemic to software also looks a bit
dicey at this point but I would have
liked a chance to check it out for
myself I will try to resolve this issue
soon when I have a bit more time to
spend troubleshooting it still even
without the no hemic audio software
installed I can confirm that the MSI z2
70 gaming m7 provides exceptional audio
quality MSI zone software is excellent
as particularly impressed with the
command center they only let down here
was again the LED lighting sadly there
are just a few color options to choose
from rather than entire spectrum of RGB
colors with the exception of that
plastic shroud I have to say the board
design and layout is excellent the
gaming m7 also offers a very solid
feature set making it quite good value
at the $240 u.s. or $400 of the asking
price in a nutshell what I liked about
MSI Z 270 gaming m7 was the appearance
the dual audio codecs the 2 amp liquid
cooling pump out
all the steel armor bits they were nice
the Triple M to support the you to
connectivity the abundance of USB 3.1
port and that front panel USB 3.1 type C
headers nice the automated game boost
overclocking and MSI's commands and a
software right so I'm going to end this
review here please let me know what you
guys think about MSI Zed 270 gaming m7
as always I'm very keen to hear your
thoughts and I'm particularly interested
what you make of that plastic shroud is
it not really a big deal and you prefer
the lighting or is it something that
needs to go I'm your host Steve and I'll
catch you on the next one
you
