using a pair of Radian unknown nano
graphics cards in the Thermaltake or V
21 micro ATX case the plan was to make a
compact yet extremely powerful 4k
capable gaming rig that could be loaded
around 2 LAN parties for the most part I
was happy with the build when scaling
well the crossfire nanos packed a
serious punch the core b21 ended up
being quite a bit bigger than I was
expecting and it's box-like shape
actually makes it quite awkward to carry
so then back to the drawing board my
search has brought me to the reasonably
new fractural design to find nano s a
mini ITX case with a conservative twenty
six point eight litre capacity
complementing this build is fractal
design zone Edison M 550 watt power
supply and Kelvin s 24 liquid cooler at
the heart of this build would be
gigabytes impressive little z170 and
Wi-Fi motherboard which would be paired
with a core i5 6600 K processor and a 16
gigabyte kingston ddr4 memory kit
finally capping it all off will be the
gigabyte GT X 1080 g1 gaming graphics
card the fractal design nano ass is
available with all without a window and
it seems to be paying a very small
premium for the windowed version that we
have on hand currently it's selling for
very reasonable 70 US dollars or 125
Australian the case measures 203
millimeters wide 330 millimeters tall
400 millimeters deep and tips of scales
of 4.6 kilograms which isn't bad for a
mostly steel construction externally we
find a simple yet elegant design and I
like that not every gaming build has to
look like it's straight out of a Michael
Bay movie
the solid front and paddle might be
constructed from plastic but it's been
given a premium brushed aluminium look
removing the brushed plastic cover
exposes a large dust filter can play
with angular vents this is the hinged
panel that snaps into place using
high-powered magnets removing it reveals
a front-mounted dynamic gp1 for 140
millimeter intake fan the left and right
sides of the front panel a ventilated
allowing the front intake fan or fans
drawing plenty of cool air the top of
the front panel module features the i/o
panel and here users will find a pair of
USB 3 ports dual audio jacks along with
a nice big circular power button and a
much smaller reset button on top there's
a removable plastic panel known as the
mod you vent which features press clips
on the
side.now I actually prefer this to
magnets as it isn't constantly falling
off when you move the case around around
the back we see that the power supply is
mounted in the bottom of the case and
above that we have a mounting point for
a 120 millimeter fan which is occupied
out of the box underneath there are four
rubberized circular feed along with a
full length removable dust filter which
clips into place very well inside the
defined NOS looks fairly basic but there
are a few clever things going on in here
there's a number of pre-drilled holes
and slots for intelligently mounting
SSDs and hard drives along with pumps
and reservoirs
inside you'll find mounting positions
for two three and a half inch or two and
a half inch drives one with another two
dedicated for two and a half inch drives
in total there are six fan positions
though it is unlikely used them all
still on top of the front and rear
pre-installed fans it is possible to
install an additional front mounted
intake fan to top mounted fans and a
bottom mounted fan the defined Nano s is
the perfect case of this builders it's
fully compatible with high-end full-size
components such as the GTX 1080 I should
be able to get away with turning the fan
speed up a little to reduce the chances
of thermal throttling thanks to
practical designs use of sound dampening
materials - speaking of which CPU cool
is as tall as 160 millimeters are
supported while power supplies can also
measure 160 millimeters deep ads for the
graphics card there's 350 millimeters
worth of headroom even with the front
intake fans installed that said if you
install a front mounted radiator like I
plan to that measurement will be reduced
by the width of the radiator
alternatively if this is a problem
radiators as large as 240 millimeters
can be mounted in the top panel because
the graphics card does face onto the
power supply fractal design doesn't
recommend using cards wider than two
slots around the back behind the
motherboard tray there's between 17 and
35 millimeters of clearance routing
cables and velcro straps have been
included for easy cable management so
the first item to go inside the define
nano s is the nifty little gigabyte Zed
170 and Wi-Fi which has been
pre-installed with the 6600 K processor
and kingston ddr4 memory you might be
wondering why I chose this mini ITX
motherboard the primary reason is down
the cost at just 135 u.s. or 210 Aussie
it's by far the best values dead 170
Mini ITX motherboard available right now
out of the box that supports USB type-c
dual Gigabit LAN 802 point 11 AC
wireless plus bluetooth 4.2 a PCI e3
point-o x 4m - connector supporting up
to 32 gigabits per second throughput for
high-speed MB ma SSDs and dual side of
Express connectors gigabyte a squeezed
in a rather impressive audio solution
using the realtek ALC 1150 codec
boasting 115 decibels SNR HD audio with
the built-in amplifier and high quality
capacitors so all of which has been
placed on an isolated section of the PCB
featuring fancy trace path lighting at
first glance the board looks to be
lacking m2 support however flipping it
over reveals gigabyte has been quite
clever by placing it on the bare
underside of the board
although the board only supports a four
pin ApS power connector gigabyte is
still included a five phase power
regulation system so this shouldn't
inhibit those overclocks too much
cooling the 6600 K is the fractal design
Kelvin s 24 an all-in-one liquid cooler
featuring a dual 120 millimeter radiator
though there are 120 millimeter and 360
millimetre radiator versions as well
this product has been developed in
cooperation with alpha cool and makes
use of enthusiast grade components and
the price does reflect this price of 120
US dollars or 190 this is a premium
product so we're expecting to see low
temperatures on the core i5 processor
unlike most all-in-one liquid coolers
this isn't a closed-loop design and
instead can be expanded upon users can
in fact open it up to get the full
benefits of custom water cooling this
means the ability to add any components
you want to the loop such as an
additional water block for the GPU as an
example
once you discover things such as the
full cup of water block you begin to
understand why the Kelvin is 24 is so
expensive fractal design also tells us
that pump features the ceramic bearing
while the radiator has an innovative
construction of copper and nylon with
the nylon is placed on the outer parts
where he transferred doesn't take place
installation of the Kelvin s 24 is about
as easy as it gets supplied in the
package of custom mounting brackets for
AMD and Intel platforms naturally we
install the Intel mounts the block is
secured to the CPU using four
spring-loaded screws which attach to a
plastic backplate for this build I
really wanted to make sure we went with
a conservative power supply so no 1000
watt plus models them in my recent in
depth GD X 1080 review I found at no
point did the system consume over 280
watts and that included a core i7 6700 K
processor locked to 4.5 gigahertz
therefore the 550 watt
provides plenty of headroom for this
build even if we overclock the CPU and
GPU price of just 90 US dollars or 120
ozzie the fractal design edison m 550
watt is a cost-effective option will
ensure sufficient power delivery with
excellent reliability making the price
even more impressive is the fact that
this is an 80 plus gold certified power
supply backed by a five-year warranty
also used to japanese electrolytic
capacitors rated at 105 degrees celsius
the modular design makes the edison am a
perfect choice for this build and while
not fully modular I've never really seen
the point of being able to remove the
essential power cables keeping things
cool and quiet is a
temperature-controlled 120 millimeter
fan with quiet long life FDB bearings
capping this all off is the Gigabyte GT
x 1080 g1 gaming graphics card providing
the best single card performance
available today if you haven't already
checked out how the g1 gaming performs
you should take a look at my review for
the performance breakdown before
throwing all the case panels back on I
installed a pair of Samsung SSD 850 pro
2 terabyte SSD is for good measure well
there you have it I hope you enjoyed
this fractal design inspired build the
defined nano s will no doubt become
another huge hit for the company and
become the go-to case for enthusiasts
looking to build a portable powerhouse
the defined nano s Calvin s 24 and
Edison M 550 watt are all perfect
examples of why fractal designs become
such to love brand by enthusiasts rather
than rely on gimmicks the focus is
clearly on quality and features you
actually need on one not just that but
despite offering premium products you
aren't paying over exuberant prices the
defined nano s in particular is a great
buy seven US dollars or 125 ozzie anyway
enough for me I want to hear what you
guys think of the fractal design to find
nano ass and the build in general let me
know in the comments
I'm your host Matt as always and I'll
see you guys next time youtubers like</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
