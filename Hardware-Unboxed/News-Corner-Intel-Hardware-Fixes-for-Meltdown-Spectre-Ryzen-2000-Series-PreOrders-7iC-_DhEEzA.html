news corner this week's news recap is
probably going to be a bit shorter than
the previous episodes as two of the
major news stories that came out since
last week we've already covered on the
channel so in case you missed it go back
and check out our coverage of the NVIDIA
GeForce Partner Program and the
suspicious AMD security flaws unveiled
by CTS labs in this week's news corner
we'll be discussing a new tomb raider
game
intel's hardware fixes for spectre and
meltdown delays to those 4k 144 Hertz
and monitors you keep asking about Rison
2000 series pre-orders and more we'll
start with Intel's announcements
surrounding meltdown and Spectre and
specifically the changes they are making
to upcoming hardware releases to protect
against these nasty vulnerabilities the
basic gist here is Intel has developed
our Hardware fix for meltdown and one of
the two Spectre variants the one that
exports branch target injection these
fixes will be implemented into new 8th
gen processes that are set to ship in
the second half of 2018
along with cascade lake which is Intel's
upcoming Xeon an h EDT platform that
refreshes sky like X essentially on 14
nanometers Intel doesn't specifically
say what 8th gen process is set for
release in the second half of the year
we'll get these fixes but they're most
likely product line they're referring to
is Cannon Lake KB Lake G and 8th
generation
H series processors will likely miss out
on the fixes and they're scheduled for
launch in q2 intel also hasn't said how
we'll be able to tell what chips have
the hardware fixes for meltdown
inspector although they do want to be
transparent about it it's worth pointing
out that Spectre variant 1 the bounds
check bypass exploit will not be
addressed with hardware fixes so we'll
still be relying on software mitigations
to protect us from some aspects of
Spector it seems this particular exploit
is difficult to address so we could be
without a hardware solution for some
time naturally the biggest question will
be how performance is affected once
Intel rolls out hardware changes to
protect against these issues the
software solutions did result in a
performance in in some circumstances
with existing chips so there is a chance
these upcoming processes with hardware
fixes will not have the same performance
improvements that Intel will once
expecting and as a quick note Intel has
now released micro code updates that
address meltdown inspector for all
processes since Sandy Bridge and fixes
for even older CPUs are currently being
worked on in display news it's
disappointing to hear that the hotly
anticipated 4k 144 Hertz
HDR displays from a sous asa and AOC are
once again delayed this time through the
third quarter of 2018 this news comes
from TFT central and we've been able to
confirm it with our own sources that the
company's preparing to release these
monitors so these monitors are based on
a new AU Optronics panel and they were
originally announced at CES 2017 and
were expected to launch at some point
during 2017 then they were delayed to q1
of 2018 and now they've been delayed
further hopefully they are quality
monitors when they do come out as we've
been waiting a while now and the actual
models I'm referring to at the Seuss
page 27 UQ the acer x 27 and aoc AG 273
ug you guys have been asking me to
review these for months and you'll be
waiting here for longer now
unfortunately and on top of this the 35
inch 34 40 by 1440 200 Hertz HDR
displays the asou speed v vq and asa
ex35 are also delayed now to q4 of 2018
this is just speculation on my part but
I believe these monitors have been
delayed to coincide with the release of
invidious next-generation consumer GPUs
there were rumors for a while that
Nvidia would announce these graphics
cards at GTC this month which would have
coincided with the old q1 2018 launch
date for these displays now we're not
expecting next-generation GPUs from
Nvidia until the third quarter and guess
what these displays have been delayed
until q3 as well it could be a
coincidence for the first 4k 144 Hertz
HDR displays are g-sync compatible and
basically in video exclusive I believe
in video has acquired the launch rights
to these ao Optronics panels
these juicing displays which is why
there are no free sink alternatives are
now so they likely have the ability to
sink the release to the launch of their
new GPUs again just speculation but
that's probably what's happening here we
should be hearing more about rising 2nd
gen pretty soon but before AMD can
officially tell us anything pre-order
pages have appeared for the rise in 2000
series that spilled the beans on some
things like TDP and clock speeds at
least assuming the details are correct
so at the top we allegedly have the
risin 720 700 X and risin 720 700 no
2800 X here and these are the 8 core 16
thread options the 2700 X is a hundred
and five watt part up from 95 watts and
will apparently be bundled with a wraith
prism cooler clock speeds are looking
like 3.7 gigahertz base and 4.3 5
gigahertz boost no clock speeds listed
for the 2700 bits a 65 watt part and
comes with the Wraith spire cooler the 6
core 12 thread parts are the risin 520
600 X and risin 520 600 the 2600 X has a
95 watt TDP comes with the Wraith spire
cooler and has clock speeds of 3.6
gigahertz base and at 4.2 5 gigahertz
boost the 2600 is a 65 watt part and
comes with the Wraith stealth cooler a
release date is listed as April 19th on
one of these pre-order pages video cards
also have this slide that allegedly
shows pricing for these CPUs though the
embargo date listed on the sliders in
2017 so who knows whether this is
actually legitimate or not anyway that's
the situation with risin 2000-series
pre-orders and again we should be
getting some official news on that soon
more interesting display news this time
related to free sync new updates are set
at the Xbox one X and Xbox one s that
will bring support for free sync
allowing gamers to hook up a compatible
monitor and achieve adaptive synced
gameplay in Xbox titles now this isn't
as useful as free sync on PC as a lot of
console games are locked to either 30 or
60 FPS and keep the framerate pretty
consistent throughout gameplay however
for those tiles that are unlocked or
fluctuate below their target framerate
free sync will help to smooth things out
it will be a niche feature considering
most Xbox owners hook up their console
to a TV and basically no TV support
adaptive sink but it is neat to have
anyway and a nice inclusion considering
the Xbox uses AMD hardware support for
free sync when we roll that in a spring
updates the Xbox one ecosystem a future
update slated for launch later in 2018
will also allow the Xbox one to
automatically select low latency modes
on supported TVs again neat for those
console gamers out there in game news
shadow of the Tomb Raider has been
revealed in a short 23 second teaser the
sequel to rise of the Tomb Raider will
be fully revealed on April 27 and then
release of the world on September 14th
this year on PC Xbox one and PlayStation
4
there's no xbox timed exclusivity for
this game unlike with rise of the Tomb
Raider
there have been rumors surrounding
shadow of the Tomb Raider for some time
now which escalated when people
uncovered a launch date in a teaser
website ahead of the first reveal and I
say first revealed because there's
another reviewer coming in April as I
mentioned I kind of miss the days when
companies were just reveal games and
give us all the information in one go
rather than this drip-feed business but
I guess it's still good news to hear
about this game really not much else to
say apparently shadow of the Tomb Raider
will be the climactic finale of Lara's
origin story which of course tells us
nothing about whether this is actually
the final game in the series or not
after all it is just the finale - an
origin story in other game used the
crash bandicoot insane trilogy is coming
to PC on July 10th alongside Xbox one
and intend o switch if you interested in
the game which did exclusively launch on
ps4
last year then you won't have to wait
much longer to get it on PC and
fortnight as well that's also coming to
iOS and Android for those who love
mobile gaming with cross-platform
support for playing with console and PC
gamers moving into the quick fire topics
of the week I don't care much about this
story but President Donald Trump has
used his presidential powers to block
Broadcom from acquiring Qualcomm in a
117 billion dollar hostile takeover
welcomes executive team was against the
acquisition but shareholders were
largely in favor as Broadcom is offering
a bit more per share than the current
price then Trump heard about Broadcom a
company with ties to Singapore
and blocked the deal citing national
security concerns it's basically the
whole story with that one another
quickfire topic here google has
announced it will ban cryptocurrency ads
from June 2018 probably because most
crypto ads are super dodgy the ban
covers crypto currency exchanges wallets
trading advice services and initial coin
offerings in response cryptocurrency
prices fell across the board which I'm
sure will please a lot of you guys that
are hoping everything will crash so you
can buy graphics cards at a reasonable
price again
unless good news a power outage on March
9th at samsung's NAND manufacturing
plant in Pyeongtaek south korea has
caused a global reduction in output for
the month to the tune of 3.5% samsung's
upward specifically has dropped by 11
percent due to the incident with up to
60,000 wafers damaged it's not clear
whether NAND prices will be affected as
a result luckily we're talking about
non-volatile nanti rather than DRAM
which is already stupidly expensive but
it's never good to hear about production
capacity being affected and that's it
for this week's news corner as always if
you like this give it a thumbs up

every Friday
