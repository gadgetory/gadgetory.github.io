touch on is they don't interest me that
much more importantly the evidence would
suggest most gamers aren't that
interested either with very few choosing
to run more than one GPU though granted
the pricing is likely the ultimate issue
here my reasons for disliking SLI and
crossfire is simple in my experience it
just isn't a practical means of
accessing extra performance i'm not
saying either technology is bad but it
should be reserved for the most extreme
GPUs available at the time software
support plays a major role here and
quite a bit of work needs to be done by
both the game developer and NVIDIA to
allow their multi GPU technology to
scale well sadly this doesn't always
happen and gamers are often left with
less than desirable performance it's not
I guess lie is a new technology either
in fact scalable link interface
technology was first developed by 3d
effects back in 1998 when it was
introduced with the Voodoo 2 I might add
this was before I got into PC gaming -
but I was 10 years old so I feel like I
can be excused apparently back then
scaling was limited by CPU performance
and it wasn't until later in 2004 after
in-video acquired 3d effects that they
introduced sli with a GeForce 6 series
with a greater degree of success since
then SLI hasn't changed a great deal the
GeForce 8 series and they were scaling
beyond just two cards and that's
remained a feature right after the
GeForce 9 series now the recently
released GeForce 10 series saw a few
changes made to SLI the most noteworthy
of which is the new sli bridge which
uses both sli connectors or fingers to
connect just two cards this has been
done to increase the available bandwidth
between the two graphics cards by using
both connectors the new sli interface
runs a 650 megahertz and maxes 63
percent frequency bump over the old 400
megahertz bridges because both
connectors are now required to
efficiently connect to GeForce 10 series
graphics cards this takes three-way and
four-way support off the table there's
been a huge amount of confusion about
this topic but in short only to a sli is
now officially supported and frankly I
think that's a good thing full
disclaimer though it is possible to link
more than two GeForce 10 graphics cards
together using legacy SLI bridges but
other than showing how much money you
can
on your rig there really is a much point
invidious game ready drivers will
include three and four-way SLI profiles
to select benchmarking applications such
as fire strike Unigine and catzilla this
of course will allow in videos name to
remain high on the benchmarking charts
as for games though we really only
expect to see two-way support so then
you've decided to bite the bullet and
get yourself a pair of GT X 1080
graphics cards you've worked hard and
you deserve it the only question now is
do you shell out another 40 dollars for
the high bandwidth sli bridge or do you
stick with the one that came with your
motherboard having spent fourteen
hundred bucks on 1080 graphics cards
already
what's another forty bucks still it
would be nice to know if that fancy
looking bridge does anything more than
just look well fancy that's what I plan
to find out today as I stick a pair of
GD X 1080 and gtx 980ti graphics cards
together using the new sli bridge and
comparing it to the old single connector
flex bridge i got for free with a zeb
170 motherboard okay so for testing my
standard GPU testing machine has been
used and the latest game ready drivers
were used to test both the gtx 980ti
and GT X 1080 configurations I'll be
focusing on 4k performance as this high
resolution should push the bandwidth
across that sli bridge the results are
extremely interesting surprising and
perhaps even a bit confusing but before
we get to that let's start with what I
was expecting to see first up we have
ARMA 3 a game that plays well below
60fps on a single 1080 when using the
high-end game quality settings
adding a second 1080 boost performance
by an impressive 74% with the old flex
bridge using that new high bandwidth
bridge pushes that figure up to 79%
though I should point out it was just 2
fps this is pretty much of the margin of
error for testing even with a three run
average
honestly this is more or less the kind
of performance I was expecting to find
here we have another super demanding
game in Crysis 3 and while adding a
second 1080 allow for a 71 percent
performance boost using the high
bandwidth bridge didn't improve that
figure dirt rally only sees a 65 percent
performance boost when enabling SLI and
the GD X 1080 cards of 4k but to be fair
that sees even the minimum frame rate
stay about 100 FPS using the high
bandwidth bridge has no impact on
performance to you the 980ti sli cards
provides 69% more performance in Star
Wars Battlefront meanwhile GD
a DSLR scout even better of providing
88% more performance using the Flex
bridge the high bandwidth bridge allows
almost perfect scaling at 96% which was
impressive to see if I was ever gonna
see a reasonable game using the new high
bandwidth bridge I expected to see in
Far Cry primal as it turns out SLI
scaling for the 1080 s is pretty good
here we see a 76% performance boost
while the high bandwidth bridge isn't
able to improve performance further rise
of the Tomb Raider was another game that
I thought might show a real benefit from
having more SLI bandwidth despite only
seeing a 66% increase in performance
when adding a second GD X 1080 the high
bandwidth bridge only increased that
margin by 5% for an extra three fps
better than nothing I guess here we see
yes the light scales superbly well in
college ad black ops 3 as we go from an
average of 58 FPS for the single GTX
1080 to 104 fps using the Flex bridge
this is the nice 79% improvement despite
that great result we see the high
bandwidth bridge is able to improve
performance even further resulting in a
91% performance gain over the single
card configuration this is great stuff
and more than what I was hoping to find
okay so this is where things get
interesting using the Flex bridge the
GTX 1080s provides us 23% more
performance over a single card so pretty
abysmal scaling this is pretty much what
we've come to expect in Witcher 3 though
using these quality setting as the 980ti
sli cards with just 35% faster than
their single card configuration using
the high bandwidth bridge does nothing
to help the gtx 980ti graphics cards but
it works wonders for the 1080s here we
see a massive 26 percent performance
gain over the Flex bridge for an average
of 67 FPS 56 percent more performance in
a single 1080 still far from the best
scaling was seen but a massive
improvement over using a legacy sli
bridge connector if you lower the
quality settings to say medium sli
scaling picks up considerably in the
witcher 3 with the Flex connector so
this does indeed suggest that the poor
scaling it is a result of limited
bandwidth between the cards Tom Clancy's
the division has more interesting
results for us here we see a huge 33
percent performance game when using the
high bandwidth her sly bridge over the
Flex bridge here the Flex bridge allowed
the SLI 1080s to deliver just 13% more
performance while the high bandwidth
bridge allows for a 51 percent
performance boost again not the best SLA
scaling you get a set
but a vast improvement nonetheless with
the high bandwidth bridge CPU
utilization increased by over 30 percent
with a flex bridge we sought a 60%
utilization on the GPUs while near 100
percent usage was seen with the high
bandwidth bridge something worth noting
here is that the high bandwidth bridge
also boosted the performance of the gtx
980ti graphics cards providing an 11
percent performance boost granted that
isn't nearly as significant as what was
seen with the 1080 graphics cards but to
my knowledge the high bandwidth bridge
isn't meant to help the Maxwell GPUs in
SLI one game that constantly throws up
unusual results is fallout 4 in keeping
with tradition it has the most extreme
legacy versus high bandwidth SLI bridge
results yet fallout 4 is a bandwidth Pig
but a 42% performance game when going
from the legacy to the high bandwidth
bridge is massive this means while I
slide only scaled by 20% previously it's
now showing a 71 percent performance
improvement with the high bandwidth
bridge over a single 1080 card
configuration unfortunately the high
bandwidth bridge doesn't help the
Maxwell base gtx 980ti graphics cards ok
so the mission here was to try and
determine if there's a tangible
difference between the legacy bridge
that you probably got for free with your
motherboard an expensive 40 US dollar
higher bandwidth bridges that have video
claims you now need also while I do plan
to run the SLI 1080s and eventually ten
70s through my 20 plus game gauntlet
that wasn't required for this video
instead the 10 game sample will painted
a rather interesting picture of course
of the ten games tested the high
bandwidth bridge only showed noteworthy
gains and just Raven that said we
essentially went from a situation where
SLI was almost broken to one where it
was scaly and over 50 percent that extra
performance was very welcome to 4k I
have to admit I was a bit hesitant to
publish these results at first I wasn't
convinced there wasn't something
unforeseen influencing the results but
after countless back and forth between
the Flex bridge and the high bandwidth
bridge the results were confirmed
reconfirmed reconfirmed again and a few
more times before I accepted what the
test system was giving me with nothing
else being changed here the performance
difference had to be coming from the sli
bridge some users have been reporting
performance gains when using two single
bridges for their 1080 sli setup to my
knowledge this caused issues with the
maximal base cards but I decided to give
it a shot after completing all the
testing previously to my surprise with
the two
flex connectors installed I received the
exact same performance boost in The
Witcher 3 division and fallout 4 as I
did with the high bandwidth bridge so it
seems if you have two legacy connectors
you don't actually need a high bandwidth
bridge surprisingly despite others
running GD X 1080 SLI tests no one else
seems to have compared the high
bandwidth bridge with the legacy bridge
