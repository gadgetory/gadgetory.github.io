unboxing boxes with Matt we're now at
episode 12 and today from all days I'm
hoping to get all the bits and pieces
that I need to finish that $1,200 build
and I'll aim to get that up later this
week unless exciting news there's this
Friday I have to get ACL surgery on my
knee so probably gonna be out of action
for a little bit but we do have some
videos in store and I'm working on
something else to keep the content
coming so stay tuned and you'll find out
what that is so for now let's get stuck
into it let's start with this little box
it's from pet circle come today you
release the boxes yeah go to Western
Digital for terabyte sshd
so this isn't the exact hard drive are
you going to be recommending the $1,200
build however this would be even better
to include if you could afford it so
it's gonna make my build even better and
this is the one I could get my hands on
so you'll see that in there and really
not sure what kind of pets would be
using a hard drive but anyway that's
that all right next up this little green
boxy box here
next is last box and massive letters so
maybe it's a sign I was meant to leave
it to last so this is a little micro ATX
H 110 motherboard from asrock don't have
plans to pull anything out super soon
with this buddy is I am working on
something for the future so this will
come in very handy they're very light
tiny package here is a very essential
part of that twelve hundred dollar bills
okay obviously a skylight core i5
processor so much to say about that but
it will be the part of the brains of the
build
alright two big boxes to go this is big
but quite light very inefficiently
packed so that is courses mm 800 RGB
Polaris Mouse cards so one of the cooler
mouse pads going around these bright RGB
fossa furious hull lights on it let's
open it up and have a look there it is
somebody mouse pads if to plug in
plastic she's really shuffle just grab
my laptop there you go sure how well you
guys can see that but it's pretty cool
rainbow effect going on the outside
really grippy underside and at the back
you can plug a USB mouse in here so
obviously this acts as a pastor as well
so that'll be pretty cool on your desk
love to get the desk mat version
and the tops it's not like a fabric
which I'm used to using it's it's more
like a hard plastic so they're quiet
that would be it's pretty loud moving
your mouse across it but it is pretty
smooth that's a pretty cool one from
Corsair on to the last box all right so
two of the last essential pieces is my
$1,200 build we've got Kula masters g5
50m power supply and their high power to
1/2 X cooler so very much looking
forward to strapping all this stuff in
and uh getting that system off the
ground all right so I've got pretty much
everything I need now for that $1,200
builds so I'm really hoping you get it
all together before I go into the knife
on Friday for the ACL surgery so stay
tuned for that
I've also pre-recorded a bunch of videos
so there will be content going out over
the next few weeks while I'm off my feet
after their surgery and I'm also working
on getting a special guest to come in
and run the unboxing boxes series and
keep it alive so keep your eye out for
