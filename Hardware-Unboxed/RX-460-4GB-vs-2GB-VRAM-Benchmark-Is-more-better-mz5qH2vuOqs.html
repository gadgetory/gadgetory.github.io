first plus 11 part the RX 416 like the
RX for 80 gamers have the option of two
different memory configurations for the
RX 460 though they aren't for given a
key but options rather than graphics
cards featuring this GPU will come with
either 4 gigabytes or 2 gigabytes of
memory for our launch day review we have
the sapphire nitro model on hand which
came loaded with 4 gigabytes of vram the
only issue with this being the 4
gigabyte models feature an MSRP of 140
dollars while the 2 gigabyte models come
in at 110
price the 110 the Ark's 460 is decent
value as it comes in at similar cost per
frame is the more expensive rx for 70
however the 4 gigabyte model at 140
dollars is horrible value at roughly
just 20% cheaper than the rx 470 it's a
little over 40% slower the choice then
seems obvious get the 2 gigabyte model
and be done with it that said if you ask
the question should I buy the 2 gigabyte
or 4 gigabyte rx 460 on a tech forum or
even the youtube comments section you'll
quickly find yourself in murky waters on
my own rx 460 review a few brave souls
ask that very question and a torrent of
answers poured in many of them backed by
strong opinions on the matter you'll
hear things like 2 gigabytes isn't
enough for 1080p gaming anymore avoid
the 2 gigabyte model as it won't last
four gigabytes is future proof and so on
rather than just assume I know the
answer I want to do some in-depth
testing and a range of games to find out
if there really is a difference if there
is under what conditions and does the
evidence suggests that the larger model
will see you off into the future with
that let's jump into the benchmarks for
this test I've dropped my sensible sky
core i3 test machine and gone for the
skylight core i7 machine to remove any
possible system bottlenecks that might
shape the results both the RX 460 models
have been clocked according to the AMD
specification this means a core
frequency of 1.2 gigahertz and a memory
frequency of 17 50 megahertz
the graphs have been labeled with the
maximum memory allocation seen when
testing when the 4gb RX 460 model this
provides a rough indication as to how
much via Ram might have been used and
I've done my best to test these games at
1080p using realistic quality settings
ideally I like to target 60fps though
given the settings used this wasn't
always possible
in some games I didn't relax the
settings too much in order to achieve a
60 FPS average and while we're there
doing so would come with a certain
degree of criticism as it would appear
as though I'm trying to avoid filling
the vram so keep that in mind when
you're seeing average frame rates
dipping down the console levels of
performance if the two gigabyte and four
gigabyte cards do deliver the same
performance when forced to such low
frame rates it's safe to assume there'll
be no difference with the relaxed
settings targeting 60 FPS performance
first let's start with the witcher 3
again that doesn't even exceed 2
gigabytes of vram when run at 1080p
using the high quality settings with
hair works disabled here we saw no more
than 1.7 gigabytes of memory allocated
during our test you might think this is
a pointless test then given it doesn't
exceed the capacity of the 2 gigabyte
model I find this a very valid test as
The Witcher 3 is very well-put-together
title boasting incredible visuals not
only that but at 1080p using the high
quality settings the RX 460 is only good
for a little over 30 fps naturally
gamers are going to want to reduce the
quality settings further for us to me
the more desirable experience and doing
so will reduce the memory capacity
requirements Mirror's Edge catalyst
might be an extreme memory Pig when
using the hyper quality settings but
that won't fly here even with the medium
quality settings we weren't able to
achieve a 60 FPS average still 50 FPS on
both the 2 gigabyte and 4 gigabyte
models is very playable note the maximum
memory allocation seen here was 1.9
gigabytes the massively popular online
first-person shooter overwatch is one
game you wouldn't expect to be very
demanding on the memory and well it
isn't in fact the 2 gigabyte model came
out slightly ahead after taking the
average of three benchmark runs but one
to two FPS is well within the margin of
error using the medium quality settings
we reached a 60 FPS average and just one
point seven gigabytes was the maximum
memory allocation seen the two gigabyte
model was 1/2 FPS slower here but again
that's considered to be within the
margin of error
grand theft auto 5 saw an allocation of
exactly two gigabytes using the high
quality settings at 1080p here both the
two gigabyte and four gigabyte models
provided exceptional performance pushing
well beyond 60fps another game to
allocate up to 2 gigabytes of memory was
the division using the medium quality
settings both models averaged 52 FPS
which allowed for very smooth gameplay
out of interest I cranked up the quality
settings too high and ran the test
again the memory allocation only
increase to 2.1 gigabytes and this
wasn't enough to upset the to cuba card
as it again provided the exact same
performance the latest game to be
featured in this comparison is Deus Ex
mankind divided using the medium quality
settings the RX 460 is only able to
average 34 FPS at 1080p as you can see
the 2 gigabyte and 4 gigabyte models
provided the exact same experience
although the performance of both RX 460
models is weak when using the medium
quality settings we decided to check the
high quality performance here the
average framerate dip below 30 fps and
yet the 2 gigabyte and 4 gigabyte models
deliver the exact same performance
Assassin's Creed syndicate is known to
be a bit of a memory hog and we can see
that when using the medium quality
settings at 1080p
here we find a maximum allocation of 2.7
gigabytes which is quite a bit more than
the 6 games we've already looked at
despite that the RX 460 performs much
the same with either 2 gigabytes or 4
gigabytes of memory when looking at the
average frame rate that's said if we
look at the frame time results here we
see the 2 gigabyte model does start to
lag behind a bit the 1% data isn't that
bad and really either is the point 1%
data that said the bigger variants here
does mean the gamers will see slightly
choppy performance at times of course
with an average of just over 40 fps some
games would want to reduce certain
quality settings which will somewhat
alleviate the strain on the VM Middle
Earth shadow of mordor was tested using
the very high quality preset which saw a
memory allocation reach 2.6 gigabytes
the average and 1% frame time
performance was much the same on both
the 2 gigabyte and 4 gigabyte models
however the 0.1% performance of the 2
gigabyte rx 460 took a serious nosedive
that said when playing the game I
honestly couldn't tell these cards apart
the to give our model certainly didn't
appear to suffer from frame drops
boosting the quality preset to ultra saw
the game maxed out the 4 gigabyte rx 460
with an allocation of 3.9 gigabytes this
did see the average performance of the 2
gigabyte model fall away and again the
frame time performance also suffered the
4 gigabyte model did play noticeably
better than the 2 gigabyte model now
still if you're a gamer who targets
60fps and it has to be said that the 2
gigabyte rx 460 will work just fine in
this game surprisingly Star Wars
Battlefront allocated up to 2.9
gigabytes worth of VRAM
during our test using the high quality
preset at 1080p yet despite that we saw
similar performance on both models in
fact here the two GUI card came out
slightly ahead Far Cry primal is another
game that provided surprising results
with the HD texture pack enabled along
with the very high quality settings the
game allocated up to 3.6 gigabytes of
vram yet despite this both the two
gigabyte and 4 gigabyte rx4 60 models
delivered similar results while the
in-game performance was
indistinguishable Batman Arkham Knight
allocated up to 3.4 gigabytes of vram
using the high quality settings though
do note that the game works options were
disabled the 2 gigabyte model did
provide slightly slower performance
though it has to be said I honestly
couldn't tell the difference between the
two models here although slow out the 2
gigabyte model didn't appear to suffer
any stuttering issues finally we have
doom and this game is in no way two
gigabytes of vram friendly note frame
time results aren't included here due to
the way I have to test on the Vulcan API
although the experience on the two
gigabyte card wasn't horrible is the
frame rate never dipped below 31 fps it
wasn't nearly as smooth as it was in the
four gigabyte model in fact the four
gigabyte version was almost 50 percent
faster when comparing the average frame
rates and more than twice as fast from
looking at the minimums this is the
shocking performance variation
especially given the game never called
for more than 3.1 gigabytes of vram it's
worth noting by lowering the shadow
quality to at the lowest value the
average frame rate of the 2 gigabyte
card jumped up to 66 FPS with the 61 FPS
minimum so what can we conclude based on
these results well a good number of
things really something I'd like to
point out right off the bat is the fact
that I did test using a high-end core i7
test system and while the results are
valid I almost regret this decision now
the impact of having to swap data out of
the vram to the system RAM or page file
is less than when using a high-end
system complete with high clocked ddr4
memory and SSD storage so therefore
while still valid I am keen to recreate
this comparison in my core i3 test rig
to see if the results change much this
is something I plan to do over the next
week and if the results are different
expect a follow-up video with that
little disclaimer out of the way what
did we find
regardless of the test system use what
we can walk away knowing is that for the
most part the RX 460 is going to deliver
the exact same performance with the true
gigabyte or 4 gigabytes via Ram
an over 90 percent of the games out
there games such as The Witcher 3
Mirror's Edge catalyst overwatch rise of
the Tomb Raider Grand Theft Auto 5 Tom
Clancy's the division Far Cry primal
Batman Arkham Knight and Star Wars
Battlefront for example all played
exactly the same on both the 2 gigabyte
and 4 gigabyte rx 460 models most of
these games were tested with the average
frame rate well below 60 fps this means
that those targeting 60 fps with even
lower quality visuals certainly won't
find a performance difference between
these cards Middle Earth shadow of
Mordor and Assassin's Creed syndicate
are examples of games that do see a
slight performance advantage in favor of
the larger 4 gigabyte card though both
were tested with averages south of 60fps
new near the case with the 2 gigabyte
model noticeably slower in fact the only
exception through my testing was doomed
this game looks to require at least a
three gigabyte frame buffer for optimal
performance though I should point out
that two gigabyte RX 460 was still able
to deliver playable performance and with
a few tweaks was able to maintain over
60 FPS at 1080p so this is hardly a
deal-breaker given the data at hand I
find it very difficult to recommend the
4 gigabyte rx 460 to anyone it just
seems like a waste of money for a little
extra cash and we're talking around 40
us yeah you can land yourself a
considerably more powerful graphics card
in the RX 470 AMD is targeting eSports
game is with the rx 460 and if you find
yourself predominantly playing titles
such as Counter Strike global Offensive
rocket League dota 2 and overwatch for
example then without question get the 2
gigabyte model as for future-proofing I
personally don't subscribe to that
theory if you're buying a sub $200
graphics card for to last generation
after generation the new standards
aren't particularly hard to begin with
but that I mean you'd have no problem
reducing a few quality settings to
achieve playable performance down the
track spending 20% more now to enjoy
almost no performance advantage simply
doesn't make sense to me I kind of
mentioned the logic behind spending at
least $30 more and what would otherwise
be a 110 dollar graphics card game
potentially nothing put that $30 in the
bank
it'll come in handy in the year or twos
time for their next year for you upgrade
