unboxing boxes on deck today we have one
two three four and five boxes well four
in a package satchel thing yes so
without wasting any time let's get into
it no silly intros this time we don't
have time for that plenty of testing at
the moment but I thought we should get
into these there's actually a few things
and a couple of these boxes I need for
some reviews and videos and things next
week that's a really large but light box
it's a case box for a case we reviewed a
while ago on the channel so and I think
the case is in there because it is very
light probably look at that one last
that one's also light okay so this is by
far the heaviest package we have where's
my knife got it so good you can stop
looking so we'll start with what is the
heaviest package and we'll see if
there's anything good in it you ready
thankfully these aren't breakable what
they are giant lumps of metal I believe
aluminium to be precise these are the
new Noctua coolers for the tr4 socket
which is thread ripper so we have a 14
millimeter 12 millimeter and looks like
they're probably a 90 millimeter cooler
so not too it just sent these over I
don't believe they're on sale yet so I
don't have pricing information I'm not
sure when you'll be able to buy them but
these are looks like full retail
packaging so they can't be too far away
let's take a look shall we will start
with the biggest one which is the Nhu 14
str 4 - SP 3 we have the standard sort
of off brown / brown very sexy
color theme from Noctua their stock
standard so in this little kit comes
with it do you get a very large tube of
thermal paste which is awesome looks
like a fan limiter couple of rubber
mounts and you also get a hex driver for
installing the CPU in the socket though
it's not a torque driver so you sort of
got to be careful with how much or how
much you tighten the socket you don't
over tighten it anyway so you're like
we're thinking well apart from the fact
that this is a very big air cooler what
makes it a thread Ripper air cooler and
again as some of you probably know the
thread Ripper CPUs are simply massive
they've got a huge heat spreader on the
mouth you can see that one there but
anyway they're very big and most of the
coolers only cover about 50 percent of
the surface area on the top of the
cooler which they still run at
reasonable temperatures but obviously if
you can cover the entire heat spreader
with a base plate that's the way to go
and that's why the base plate on these
things is thread river massive because
they are so big though you can't install
these on other platforms so they will
only come with a Tier four mounting kit
which as you can see is pre-installed
already I've given you guys a little bit
of misinformation this isn't for this
isn't for installing thread Ripper so
forget everything I said about this
because you know I don't read manuals
and stuff this is quite clearly too
small for that I thought that when I
said it but of course I just said it
anyway
this is actually for securing the
heatsink to the socket mounts so like a
so it goes on these so it's quite tight
on the edge of the heatsink there but it
looks like you can get to it so anyway
you don't try and use that for
installing the CPU on the socket because
it just won't work I just spin around do
nothing
so the heatsink does stand a hundred and
fifty eight millimeters tall I'm not
sure if that includes the fan or not
install because it is fan does poke a
fair bit above and it is quite tall
it's basically 700 grams 695 grams so
it's a heavy sucker but yeah basically
I'm very keen to cover this thing and
that will paste whack it on the thread
Ripper CPU and see what kind of
temperatures we get at 4 gigahertz on
something like these 69 50 X with all
cores running at 4 gigahertz all right
so we're now getting into the Nhu 12s
tier 4 SP 3 so this is the slightly
smaller version of what we just looked
at if I can get it out of the box so far
I can't
no wonder the cameras ran out of
batteries during these unboxing boxes
episodes I'm sure there's an easier way
to do that but whatever that was the
hard way to do it so you get the same
little accessories package you get a
nice big thing of thermal paste and you
get this little allen key thing which is
for installing the cooler to them the
mounting so yeah that's what that's for
anyway I'm an alpha I just realized
and you guys are probably well aware I
was reading the specifications for this
off the wrong box oh I need to get some
sleep okay rewind quickly this cooler is
actually 865 grams without the fan and
1030 grams with the fan so is in fact a
kilo I thought it felt like it was at
least a kilo so it is a smidgen over and
it is taller than 150 millimeters like I
thought it was it's 165 millimeters so
yeah my review on that a second ago was
completely wrong 165 millimeters tall
and it's a hundred and thirty grams of
the fan installed obviously a 140
millimeter fan anyway moving forward
this one which I just told you the
specifications for 870 grams in total
158 millimeters tall and it's the 120
millimeter version so a bit more compact
one two three four looks like we've got
five heat pipes on this one I think
they're a bit thinner as well mmm
no they're much the same I think just
one less heat pipe but of course the
base plate is the same big nice thread
with a base plate so now that I've
perfectly executed those first two
products I'm absolutely gonna nail this
third one okay so this is a you type
cooler with a 92 millimeter fan of the
u9 this one so it'll have a cute little
fan compared to the other ones similar
accessories package it looks like
there's a few
a fan's splitter in there but other than
that all the same this looks much more
like what you would find in a server
again you gets again it's a thread
Ripper only works on thread Ripper
sockets tr4 socket so you have the huge
baseplate that's great to see that
should work well Tanna heat pipes one
two three four via six in total so it's
just old wall of wall of heat pipes
under this thing pair of 92 millimeter
fans in push-pull so that'll push and
pull lots of air through that array of
fins should do a good job I'm also keen
to see how how loud this is and how much
of it how good of a job it does on
thread group row say the the sixteen
core model with all cores at four
gigahertz that would be interesting to
see of course I will test all three of
them so you will see exactly that okay
so there's the new knocked over coolers
sorry about the mix ups there and the
misinformation wasn't on my a-game I'll
admit probably one of my worst happen
boxing so they didn't come out too
poorly but I have a few more boxes to
redeem myself hopefully we can get this
show back on the road
I'm gonna sit these down there alright
time to make a much-needed recovery will
go for this big box hopefully it's got
something in here that can save me
alright I haven't had a look inside this
yet let's do it together we'll go for
the money shot let's look at alright
that's looking pretty good what have we
got here
Boris graphics card with gtx 980ti thank
you very much
extreme edition we've already looked at
this extreme edition so that's
interesting hmm hopefully it's not
something else they've just used this
box
slightly concerned Oh does it not say
that on the front hang on I don't to
mess this up
ah yes okay this is a very important
thing to note here there's a little icon
logo thing here and it says water force
this is the water force version of the
extreme edition I don't know why that
isn't more obvious on the box it doesn't
really say it there either but I did
spot a picture on the back here that
says it is the all-in-one cooling system
water force version so that means it's
got a 120 millimeter radiator all in one
I'll stop talking about let's get it out
and take a look I've been trying to get
my hands on a card like this or this
particular model for quite some time has
not been easy you guys keep saying me
Steve can you review some realistic
cards we can afford I'd love to but at
the moment all I can get is 1080 tea
eyes they're actually easier to get to
full review right now than an rx 580 or
anything pretty much
Radeon based so we're stuck with 1080
TOI reviews for now but I'm quite happy
with that it's uh let's get this sucker
out even gtx 1070 s very hard to come by
so yeah hopefully we'll have some board
partner vega cards coming soon that'll
be exciting all right it is indeed the
water force card well that looks a bit
special now doesn't it there you have it
and all in one liquid-cooled 1080 TI so
it's obviously still a dual slot card
it's got a quite a large pump and block
on top of where the GPU would be looks
like a very big copper base plate as
well with so there's at least one copper
heat pipe there which covers
the VRM so it goes from next to the GPU
water block to the vrm so it's
definitely an all-in-one cooled solution
there are actually no fans out along
this one so yeah the radiator is cooling
everything on the card well this was a
nice surprise I was not expecting this
card at all I've been asking gigabyte
for a while but didn't know it was
coming
I believe 1500 ozzie dollars is what you
can expect to pay for this guy it's
about eight hundred and twenty dollars
u.s. so the MSRP is seven hundred
dollars u.s. so obviously you're paying
a premium at this card but it is a
liquid-cooled it's going to run
extremely cool extremely quiet I'm not
sure if that will allow us to overclock
at any further you should definitely be
able to run the card at two gigahertz
with all those CUDA cores and yeah it'll
do that while being quiet so that's
obviously a big huge bonus they're
probably worth paying their premium for
especially if you like a high-end bit
quiet system so as I mentioned it does
have a copper cold plate copper block it
is a two slot design it has a 12 plus 2
phase power design I believe I'm quoting
that correctly out of the box it will
run at a boost frequency while quoted
boost frequency of 17 hundred and twenty
one megahertz it'll naturally run much
higher than I expect at least 1.9
gigahertz and the base frequency is
sixteen hundred and seven megahertz so a
little factory overclock there that's
with the gaming mode now and a really
cool thing about this cart that is in
the performance specifications is the
fact that it comes with a four year
warranty so that is very nice indeed you
can see here it's got a pair of eight
pin dual 8 p.m. hour inputs so that's
more than sufficient for a 1080 TI looks
like we've got a HDMI output on the rear
of the card so you can use that for VR
link and stuff like that there's another
two HDMI on the IO and DVI port and
three DisplayPort so he goes triple
display what monitors if you want to
it's got a plastic shroud on it isn't
the usual sort of aluminium that you
find on the extreme cards so a little
disappointing but it looks fine anyway
and really
I'm more interested in how cool and
quiet runs decent backplate it's not the
extreme back plates you normally see on
the extreme edition cars it's more of
the sort of I think we saw that on the
lowering like the 1016 I rx 580 but with
this thing sucking so much of their heat
away from the card it's probably not
that important probably not much else
needs to be said about this for now very
excited to have it I don't think I
messed any of that up too much well sit
that aside for that moment let's have a
look at this little white weightless box
what we've got found it very good I need
this actually this is going to come in
very handy when I test all those heat
sinks because I'm going to need a
truckload of it so I know I've got at
least one tube in here so this is
thermal Grizzly's thermal paste this was
provided by PC case key so big thanks to
those guys for sending that over timing
could not have been better on that one
so I haven't actually used this
particular type yet I think it is liquid
metal it is indeed liquid metal sort of
not that keen on liquid metal at the
moment yeah I'll talk about that a bit
later but I'm keen to give this stuff a
try anyway don't know if I'll use it on
those heat sinks they'll probably go for
your more traditional thermal paste but
anyway I will be doing something with
this stuff soon I'll check it out and
let you guys know what I think of it and
this is kind of an important one don't
use with aluminium heat sinks it will
eat away at them so although that's a
nickel plated copper base I'm not sure
how it goes with that stuff the new Clio
stuff it's probably okay but anyway I'm
not really a fan of liquid metal I
prefer I believe the thermal Griezmann
will grizzly brand make awesome thermal
compound stuff so I'll speak to the guys
at PC case Kia and yeah I'll get back to
you guys on that anyway we'll move right
along
we'll go for this one because this is
actually another item sent from PC case
gear I purchased this through those guys
last week so they were pretty quick to
fulfill that order so that's nice and
this is one that you guys have been
recommending or not recommending and
this is one that you guys have been
requesting I look at for quite some time
and I just happen to buy them but
they're in stock now and what is it you
ask it is the new AP use what's not
technically the newest ap use we're
still waiting on Zen based ap use in
architecture ap use it isn't based on
the Zen architecture so it still uses
excavator cause excavator architecture
but it is able to be installed on an AM
4 motherboard so you can take advantage
of the new be 350 chipset for example
you can overclock it on that and you can
also use ddr4 memory which will no doubt
help with the Radeon r7 graphics which
is integrated into the chip because it
is an APU and it runs at up to 4.2
gigahertz out of the box I believe it
has a base frequency of 3.8 that isn't
written on the box but I think it's
three point eight and they advertise
it's an 8 compute unit GPU so I think
that's 512 stream processors as you can
tell I don't know too much about it yet
but I did buy it because you guys are in
requesting I review it sold all the
appropriate research soon chuck it in a
system test it out and see if it is
worthy of the asking price I think it's
worth about 110 us and about 150 Ozzy so
very entry-level affordable for what it
offers CPU and sort of GPU solution in
one integrated GPU yeah so I'm glad to
have that more testing to be done
ok well got some pretty good product so
far it's all stuff I plan to test on the
channel the next week or two I really
want to get on to those new thread
Ripper heat sinks ASAP very keen to test
this out hopefully I'll get to that soon
and then obviously this one which has
been heavily requested I'll have to go
into that as well probably do a build
with that as well using low end in a.m.
for motherboard and stuff like that
alright anyway last box on today's
agenda the mystery box what do we have
in here okay firm oh I've been waiting
for this for a while it's a dusty
threadbare package so thread Ripper box
and I've been waiting for this for a
while I want to use this in my personal
rig which will be using the MSI x-ray
neuron carbon robot which I've shown on
the channel before but that will be
going my personal rig so this will be my
new editing build new processor for my
editing rig so the board I'm speaking of
is this guy right here very sleek and
sexy looking x3 99 motherboard from MSI
it's got a pair of eight pin power
inputs it's actually really well priced
this board it's one of the cheaper x3
nono boards on the market I think it's
350 us which is obviously still makes it
a pricey motherboard but as far as x3 99
boards go it's actually quite affordable
especially considering it has a heap of
really nice features pretty much
everything you need on one of these
boards yeah definitely covers everything
I'm gonna need so yeah that's the board
I'll be using and finally I now have the
CPU I'll be using because I can't just
throw in the 1950 xcp I already have
because I can't really benchmark my
editing rig it doesn't really work that
way
so I need two of these so here is number
two um you've already seen me unbox this
on the channel so there really isn't
much point doing it again though I am
keen to have a look inside maybe we'll
do a technically correct unboxing
because the fun unboxing is that a few
guys like myself and J and other
youtubers did upset they triggered a few
people that didn't like watching us
fumble around and try
be entertaining so we're gonna do this
I'm gonna do this correctly and see if
that helps set the record straight so
here we go thread ripper box there is a
thread ripper cpu inside and we're going
to take it out in a sensible and
efficient fashion so rather than tear
this all we've got this knife handy here
so we're just going to run that through
there like so beautifully done stayed
within the lines you know just going to
go out leave that grab the tab and it
comes out like that it doesn't get any
easier so so far we're doing really well
here so now you don't I know it says
unlock the power it's so tempting just
to go off and lock the power I'm excited
I've got a new thread Ripper CPU let's
do that first if you do that you're an
idiot
idiots do that I just want to make that
clear don't do that alright what you
want to do is once you've taken the
exterior cardboard paper ething off you
want to lift that's all you want to do
just lift like that that's how it's done
put that aside somewhere safe out of the
way
next step because it next step it's
quite simple this just lifts out now if
you've already undone this as soon as
you lift this out its gonna fall out
it'll look bloody stupid so you don't
that to happen
so now look at this look how smoothly
this is all going now what you want to
do is lay it down flat just carefully
now unlock in the direction it tells you
so anti-clockwise and voila just comes
out like that you don't drop anything
and look like a turkey these things now
you don't need that and you've got this
okay now lay it down flat because you
don't want to be holding it and risk
dropping the processor out and looking
like a buffoon grab the metal tab pull
that out and like that that's it
easy then you just grab there got to be
careful lifting you because this could
fall apart right now because we've taken
the safety tab off you want to grab
these two side tabs press them down and
that pops off like that you want to make
sure that's laying flat so that doesn't
fall out and then this is crucial make
sure you do this right you grab this
orange tab and you just lift up and then
pull and there you go
pops out so a little aggressive it's a
little crude but it comes out like that
and then there you go you've got your
thread receiver you can put that aside
now
and that is unboxing complete
start-to-finish nailed that absolutely
perfectly now the temptation here is to
go wow that's a sexy-looking processor
but it's in an orange caddy and that's
just gross oh I don't want to do my
b-roll with that gross or interesting
around let's take it out don't do that I
know the temptations there you do that
you're going to trigger the whole
internet people are going to tell you
that you're a moron because you need
this orange thing to install it I don't
care if you put text on the screen
saying be careful with the orange thing
don't throw it away because it's
important don't just don't take it out
there's no need all right just put up
with it being there and that's what
we're going to do so there is my 1950 ex
in the orange plastic caddy thing we're
not going to take it out and whatever
you do don't touch any of the contact
pads on the back that is absolute vital
you do that to see if you miles will
throw it away so there we go
we're going to install that later do
some benchmarking and we've done that to
perfection now in case you don't know in
the bottom here you've got an
instruction manual I've already done
that so I've learned my lesson
torque screw for doing it up no worries
and then a bracket if you have an Asus
tech all-in-one liquid cooler which we
probably won't be using because we've
got the Noctua coolers now I'm messing
this up there we go got it out starting
to sweat alright so there it is
bad unboxing thread Ripper thing of the
past hope you guys enjoyed this episode
of unboxing boxes started off a bit
shaky but I think we've kind of got
there in the end it's a yeah different
kind of episode but I needed a break
I've actually been just going my brain
is a bit fried because I've been going
through entry after entry for upgrade my
PC please don't get me wrong I'm super
super happy very stoked and pleased that
so many of you guys have taken the time
to put really good high-quality
submissions in we're still trying to
push for quite a few guys to provide
better photos but some of you are coming
through with those but I've just been
we've had over well over 500 submissions
now and a lot of them are very good so
I've been spending hours and hours and
hours going through them and narrowing
the list down for the first episode and
you know we'll use them throughout the
season of course you can keep submitting
you
PC to be included and upgrade my PC
please as the season goes on so the
submissions won't close you can add them
whatever but if you are going to provide
a submission really high quality photos
go for I mean even if you only have a
smartphone or something take the
computer case outside use natural light
it'll improve it massively we're getting
so many high iso photos that are just
black basically so take the time wait
till the next day if it's at night when
you're doing your submission you can add
the photos in it anytime we're talking
to you guys it's a private thread with
just you and the staff so yeah anyway
that's pretty much why I'm a bit
exhausted because that's harder than
benchmarking going through all those
submissions but I really appreciate all
the guys that have submitted their stuff
and yeah it's really good hopefully we
can have a successful first episode in a
few days time anyway that does it for
this episode of unboxing boxes I'm your
host Steve I'll see you again soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
