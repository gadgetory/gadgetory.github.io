milk the call of duty franchise for all
it's worth yet again we find ourselves
the futuristic shooter but this time
there's a crazy twist it's in outer
space anyway I won't rip on the game too
much the single-player campaign actually
looks pretty good at least from what
I've seen so far the professional
reviews are also mostly positive from
what I've seen though gamers themselves
are having fun tearing every aspect of
the game to shreds quite a few of you
have asked for performance video showing
how the current and previous generation
AMD and NVIDIA GPUs handle this new Call
of Duty tile well ask and you shall
receive I've tested 23 GPUs and our core
i7 test rig using the latest drivers
from both teams by now I'm sure you guys
know the drill so before we get on with
it here's a quick look at the quality
settings use for testing essentially
we've maxed out every quality setting
SMA 82 x was the anti-aliasing method
used while options that could be set to
ultra and extreme were testing takes
place at the start of the black sky
mission and well rather than describe
the run let's just take a look
sent def is using our latest guns to
shoot down the fleet
I'm really not sure what's going on
lately with AMD in their directx 11
performance but they have been kicking
some serious goals the gtx 960 just
managed to live on what we feel is
acceptable performance while the r9 380
offers a much smoother experience at
1080p likewise a 390 was considerably
better than the GTX 970 even at the top
end of the food chain we see that the
fury x is able to edge out the gtx 980
TI allowing it to rub transistors with
the Titan X moving to 1440p the r9 390 X
is required for a 60 FPS average while
nvidia's gtx 980 averaged 51 frames a
second the GTX 950 and 960 fellow a to
unplayable frame rates while the r9 380
and 3 DX hung in there again the fury x
can be found alongside the 980 TI and
tight necks the previous generation GPU
struggle at 4k and while a few quality
settings can be downgraded without
impacting the visuals too heavily we
recommend gamers look to the current
generation lineup for 4k gameplay even
with the current generation GPUs we find
AMD has a significant performance
advantage in this title the RX 480
easily disposed of the GTX 1060
delivering ten percent more performance
at 1080p meanwhile the RX 470 was
fifty-five percent faster than the new
gtx 1050 TI so a bit of a slaying there
then although both were very playable it
is crazy to see the gtx 1070 offering
just ten percent more performance in the
RX 480 those are all in a game at 1440p
can do so with the RX 474 80 or gtx 1060
the three gigabyte 1060 did dip
noticeably lower at times but issues
such as stuttering wasn't seen
impressively the RX 480 is still
averaged over 60 FPS at this resolution
ideally gamers will want the GD x 1080
for a smooth 4k gaming experience and if
you can afford at the Titan XP is
naturally the most powerful option here
delivering almost fifty percent more
performance in the gtx 280 throwing
young and old together we end up with
this mess the fury ex looks mighty
impressive sitting alongside the gtx
1070 and as we previously saw also the
maxwell tight necks the RX 470 has no
trouble crushing the highly popular gtx
970 while almost matching the gtx 980
at 1440p we find a few variations in
performance the RX 470 is now able to
not just out class the GTX 970 but also
the 980 and buy a fairly significant
margin I might add for now AMD lacks the
GPU firepower to fight the 4k battle and
although the fury x did pull ahead of
the gtx 1070 neither is really fast
enough here the GTX 1080 on the other
hand scraped by while the Titan XP
obliterates everything with next level
performance like titanfall 2 we find
that call of duty infinite warfare isn't
particularly demanding on the CPU using
our core i7 6700 k test rig utilization
rarely exceeded thirty percent during
both the single-player and multiplayer
portions of the game core i3 users have
been reporting high frame rates and
given what we've seen here I'm not at
all surprised well the good news being
that gamers won't require hideously
expensive graphics cards such as the
feller i have here to my left to enjoy
smooth consistent playable frame rates
at resolutions up to 1440p the best
value option by far looks to be the RX
470 though the GTX 1060 holds its own
well enough optimization for the current
and previous generation GPS is very
impressive and they really took it to
the competing Maxwell and Pascal GPUs
along with the mild GPU requirements the
game will also run happily on a core i5
or FX series processor of course we
always expected 2016 full of duty going
to be relatively hardware friendly given
the graphics aren't anything special
assuming the game was optimized well
enough it was always going to run on
mid-range hardware and thankfully this
is in the case graphically the game
doesn't look too bad but it pales in
comparison when compared to battlefield
one for example well that wraps up our
performance coverage of the latest in a
long line of Call of Duty games infinite
warfare being what is it the 13th
installment now in the series at this
point you really have to wonder how many
times a game can be recycled so what do
you guys think will you be investing
your money in this title I'm very very
keen to hear what you have to say this
has been Steve bringing you another
performance breakdown I hope you enjoyed
it and I'll catch you guys next time
