product from Razer it's called the
turret and it's absolutely named because
if it works well we should finally never
have to move again the Toyotas are small
all-in-one mouse keyboard and mouse pad
designed so you can comfortably use your
PC from the couch just free a couple of
months ago I looked at the Corsair lap
dog which served a similar purpose but
in a very different way the laptop was
big padded bulky and you need to supply
your own mouse and keyboard the turret
is small thin Wireless and includes
everything you need to start controlling
your PC immediately but that doesn't
necessarily mean it's better let's take
a closer look the turrets body is a 10
Kahless laptop style chiclet keyboard
with the mousepad attached there's no
backlighting on this bad boy and those
the hate laptop keyboards will probably
hate this thing - to be honest in an
effort to save space a lot of the keys
aren't standard size either and the
arrow keys are crammed into the bottom
corner overall it's just under 21 inches
long and four point eight inches wide so
it'll fit on even the smallest of laps
for me this makes it suitable for
convenient couch browsing but any sort
of decent gaming is a real stretch the
fold-out mousepad is convenient though
left-handed users can write this one off
it's stuck on the right-hand side the
surface is a nice smooth plastic and it
felt nice under the included mouse which
is extremely similar in design to the
Orochi bluetooth mouse that I take
around with my laptop the only
difference is that it forgoes the rubber
grips on the side and the RGB lighting
which I'm sure most users can do without
this isn't ambidextrous Mouse but as
mentioned the mouse pad is stuck with
the right-hand side so that features a
little redundant I love me a mechanical
keyboard but sometimes actually don't
mind the speed and responsiveness of the
little Chiclets it's a big shift from a
full-sized mechanical keyboard but I
didn't find the turret keyboard too bad
to use especially if you're just
browsing around as mentioned one issue I
found using it on my lap was that with
the mousepad folded out you kind of have
to have the keyboard off-center due the
way it balances this wasn't too much of
an issue for the most part and I
actually ended up using it on my coffee
table rather than my lap a fair bit
anyway but this isn't really what it's
designed for the wireless performance of
the turret was good and you've got the
option to choose between Bluetooth or
using the
included 2.4 gigahertz dongle to connect
the device to your PC I didn't have any
issues with the signal at all and I'm so
glad wireless tech has come so far over
the last decade battery life is rated at
40 hours on the mouse which might be a
little lacking and 4 months on the
keyboard which is obviously plenty the
turret comes with its own charging
station - which holds the mouse and
keyboard vertically this looks pretty
cool in my opinion
Razer synapse software is used to
control the turret and as we know it's a
well-polished suite all of the keys on
the keyboard are programmable and as
always you can set profiles for
different games and applications the
mouse's dpi can also be adjusted
anywhere from two hundred to three and a
half thousand which should be adequate
for large resolutions the turret is a
really cool product overall but for me
it's not something I'd really use very
often I'll be happy spending a lot of
money on sure it's an elegant solution
for those who like to browse from their
couch but I really found my cheaper
Logitech wireless mouse and keyboard on
the coffee table almost as satisfactory
the built-in mouse pad is a nice touch
as is the charging dock but for me
playing any games other than the
absolutely most casual would really be
too much of a pain on the compromised
keyboard and very small mouse pad
there's really not much of a comparison
to the Corsair lapdog I mentioned at the
start of the review for me there's
served very different functions the luck
dog has a solid crack at being a legit
couch camera solution while the turrets
is browsing very well and very casual
gaming - like almost all Razer products
does look nice and the build quality
feels good as always
coming in at $150 on Amazon it's the
same price as the lap dog except you
don't need to supply your own mouse and
keyboard after that so it's really a
much more cost-effective solution my
wireless mouse and keyboard in living
room is twenty five Australian dollars
though and in Australia the tardis two
hundred and twenty dollars so whether
it's worth paying nearly $200 more for
is really up in the air what are you
