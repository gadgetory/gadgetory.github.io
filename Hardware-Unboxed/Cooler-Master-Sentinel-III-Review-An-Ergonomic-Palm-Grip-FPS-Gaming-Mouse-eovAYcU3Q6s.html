gonna be taking a look at cooler masters
new gaming mouse the Sentinel 3 this is
the first time I've had the pleasure of
checking out a cooler master mouse on
first impression it looks like I'm onto
a good one I'm more of a clogged up
using myself and the Sentinel is
specifically a palm grip mouse but I'm
still finding it pretty comfortable to
use to me it's a cool looking Mouse to
play new futuristic flashy with sleek
and smooth shapes the body of the
Sentinel is sandy looking with smooth
feeling charcoal all over and the
buttons are a slightly darker black
color the center of the mouse features a
clear plastic with a transparent a
honeycomb pattern that reveals an RGB
illuminated chamber inside as well as a
black panel that will come back to you
shortly coming around to the front of
the mouse or two embedded headlights the
color and light up the mousepad ahead of
your hand which is a pretty cool effect
as mentioned it is a palm grip Mouse and
as such the body is reasonably big but
definitely not overly so and the left
side features a good sized groove for
your thumb
finally the underside of the mouse
features four mouse feet for smooth
gliding and the compartment of the back
with five four and a half gram weights
can be placed now that black panel in
the very top middle of the mouse that I
mentioned actually contains an LED
display that shows you which profile you
have selected the current dpi setting
and you can also add a custom 32 by 32
logo at the back this is definitely a
cool touch but I really liked being able
to see exactly which dpi setting and
profiles on without having to remember
which color is which or quickly swing
the mouse around to feel the dpi change
I quite liked the button layout of the
Sentinel 3 to the left and right mouse
buttons are nice and long the other
buttons that control the profiles and
dpi levels on the fly are flattened out
of the way the two dpi shift buttons are
tucked behind the mouse wheel and one
has a protruding dot on it so you know
which one you're touching without
looking down the profile switch button
is right at the front of the mouse ahead
of the scroll wheel finally the back and
forward buttons are high up on the left
side of the mouse so to use them you do
need to lift your thumb right up off the
thumb rest a high-end gaming mouse
wouldn't be nearly as powerful without a
solid accompanying software and
coolermaster certainly have one The
Sentinel 3 control panel is just under a
10 megabyte download and after a quick
installation you'll have full control of
the mouse's function and RGB LEDs in the
main control panel you can customize
an assignment assigned secondary
functions with cooler massive storm TX
mode black Rockets easy shift + change
the LED colors and mode customize the
sensor with dpi levels angle snapping
lift off distance and angle tuning and
finally control your operating system
sensitivity settings in the macro tab
you can create just that macros and the
library tab allows you to store and load
as many profiles and macros as you'd
like in case you have more than 5 lastly
the support tab gives you access to
updates and online support something
else I liked about the software was that
no matter what tab you're in the 5
profiles on the mouse can quickly and
easily be accessed at the bottom of the
screen and you can assign icons to them
too
I found this central 3 comfortable and
accurate to use in a variety of games
and in Windows I wouldn't say I was
instantly my favorite ever Mouse to use
but I'm extremely used to using either
the my onyx caster or the Logitech G 403
so would take quite an adjustment period
to get my am dial right in with a new
Mouse having said that it's definitely a
very good Gaming Mouse and you can trust
the matte UV coating 20 million clicks
switches 32-bit Aaron processor and a
vago 39 88 sensor they're both lost the
distance and give you very reliable
consistent and accurate tracking
combined with cooler masters impressive
and powerful software this is a package
that was certainly satisfied
right-handed palm grip gamers would like
be able to tweak and customize their
sensor to their heart's content coming
in at 60 US dollars I think this mouse
is extremely well priced in the States
and delivers excellent value and
features for the price point in
Australia you can pick up the Sentinel
for 80 bucks
which is quite a low Australia tax
compared to a lot of other products I've
looked at making this one of the best
gaming mouse purchases in the region let
me know what you guys think of the
Sentinel 3 in the comments
I'm your host Matt as always and I'll
see you guys next time you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
