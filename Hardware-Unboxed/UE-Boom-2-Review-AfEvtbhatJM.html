speakers on the market today and I've
had the pleasure of reviewing a few of
them one of my favorites was the Yui
roll a compact and uniquely designed
disc shaped Bluetooth speaker that was
completely waterproof and offer great
sound for its small size today I have on
hand its bigger brother the UE boom -
it's very unique and frankly awesome
packaging as the name suggests the boon
2 is the follow-up from you is very
successful original boom at first
impression the design looks very very
similar keeping the same cylindrical
shape and wrapped in a similar but
tighter fabric weave with rubber
features it measures in a 180
millimetres tall with a diameter of 6 to
7 millimeters so it's small enough to
sleep in the most active wear pockets at
one rubber end you'll find the dimple
power button along with a little
mosquito bite Bluetooth button this
rubber continues down the length of the
speaker covering one side and this is
where you'll find the large of volume up
and down buttons next to the ue logo and
what i'll call the bottom of the speaker
you'll find the waterproof ports one
micro USB port for charging the device
and one three-and-a-half millimeter
input jack for wired connectivity these
ports are both concealed behind a
waterproof rubber flap that can be
completely removed for cleaning by
removing a little UE brand of black
screw the battery is a real strengths of
the boom - despite its relatively small
size and weight it boasts 15 hours of
playback at moderate volumes which is
great for those that want to use this
rugged little speaker on the go
the device charges up in two and a half
hours and you can request a battery
check from the lady inside the room - by
pressing and holding both volume buttons
at once 50 percent charge now let's
mention the boom - is this time around
waterproof with an ipx7 rating this
means it can be dunked in water up to a
meter deep for up to thirty minutes
without any concerns whatsoever this is
great to have on a supposedly rugged
speaker as often times it's going to be
used out and about outside near water
and possibly children and it means
there's no need to worry if little
Johnny boots it into the pool now like
the UE roll an original boom before it
there are no media buttons on the device
but the boom - has something even more
clever up its sleeve to pause and play a
track you can simply tap the top of the
device once and you can give it to Creek
tabs to ski
to the next song I really like this is
it's much quicker and easier to do than
picking up your phone unlocking it and
then performing either of the two
aforementioned functions it's really
handy when your hands are wet too the
Bluetooth performance is great again
just like the other Yui models and I
found I was able to walk at least 10
meters away with uninterrupted streaming
with Yui claiming reception over 30
meters as well of course depend on your
streaming device too but as far as the
bloom tours concerns the performance is
great the broom toe is also able to act
as a speakerphone and does include an
integrated microphone that works about
as well as you'd expect on the inside
there's two one and three-quarter inch
drivers and two three-inch passive
radiators responsible for the sound of
the boom tube produces you reclaim that
25% louder than the original boom and
while I don't have one here for
comparison I can say the broom 2 is
quite loud especially for its size the
sound is about as good as you could
expect from such a small package
performing best at moderate allowed
volumes where I think most people will
be using it you a also provide a UE boom
smartphone app within which you're able
to update the firmware remotely set
alarms using your music library play
with the EQ check the battery level and
connect to UE speakers to play audio
from the same source there's a few extra
options in the settings menu - where you
can change the name of the device change
the alert language turn off the alert
sounds and a few other things the
interface of the app is really nice and
it's a great feature that really expands
the functionality of the speaker overall
the UE boom 2 is a really great portable
rugged Bluetooth speaker it's made real
improvements from the original boom and
I've seen it on Amazon for 150 USD at
this price it's a fantastic buys the
original boom is still sitting around
100 to 120 dollars in Australia you can
pick up the boom - for 160 dollars this
represents even better value considering
the current exchange rate so if you're
looking for a great all-round rug your
Bluetooth speaker I can almost guarantee
you won't be disappointed with the UE
boom - I'm your host Matt as always and
I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
