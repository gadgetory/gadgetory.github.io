and graphics cards are just too big we
don't like fat graphics cards three
slots really well for those of you who
let your graphics cards are lean and
still very mean I have just the product
for you meet the new Galaxy at onna a
gtx 1070 that keeps its elbows tucked in
welcome back to harbor unboxed yes it is
finally time for a deluxe katana review
back in april when word broke that Galax
would be introducing a single slot
geforce gtx 1070 graphics card I just
knew I had to have one thankfully Galax
agreed and promptly sent one over ok
enough bragging about my new gtx 1070
graphics card time to find out if it is
actually any good but before we do jump
to the benchmarks let's quickly go over
the card and strip it down for some sexy
PCB shots yeah i really need to get out
more anyway down to business
so obviously the galaxy toner is a bit
special as there are very few single
slot gaming graphics cards on the market
these days but certainly a rare find in
fact to my knowledge this is the only
single slot air-cooled gtx 1070 in the
world
generally speaking anything sporting a
thermal design power rating that's
greater than 75 watts features a dual
slot cooler strapped on to it as the
larger coolers dissipate the added heat
more efficiently this is a practical
solution as it greatly reduces not just
the operating temperatures but also the
volume not only that but for years now
desktop systems have been designed with
dual slot graphics cards in mind so you
might be wondering why bother making a
single slot card at all then without
question the gtx 1070 katana is a niche
product that said though there are those
out there who will love what this slim
down graphics card has to offer there
are compact small form-factor systems
that can't afford to sacrifice expansion
slots as their owners wish to install
additional adding cards such as a sound
card nvme SSD Thunderbolt 3 controller
additional SATA ports and so on it is
also worth noting that you will only
require a single slot between the cards
for SLI support rather than the typical
two slot spacing this means you should
actually see better operating
temperatures
with a pair of katana cards when
compared to bigger dual slot cards on a
board such as the Isuzu ROG Strix to 70g
gaming or the as rockers and 270 m
Xtreme for for example a few of you in
the comments section of my latest
unboxing video where I discovered the
katana for the first time so that this
is the card you would actually like to
use in your workstation maybe even quite
a few of them so that's an option as
well anyway as I said this is a niche
product and it certainly won't be for
everyone but for those who have been
seeking a relatively high in graphics
card that only takes up a single slot
then the katana will be a godsend as a
single slot solution the katana measures
just sixteen millimeters thick
not bad given the pallet gtx 1080i that
i just reviewed measured three times as
wide even though this is a thin card
it's still quite long measuring 254
millimeters and to end that said the PCB
accounts for only 67% of the cards total
length covering the entire front sight
is a pancake like aluminium fan shroud
which has been painted gunmetal grey
towards the io end we find some cutouts
in the fan shroud which are meant to
help with cooling and at the opposite
end we do of course find a 17 millimeter
blower fan the fan pushes air over what
Galax call a turbo radiator this is an
all copper heatsink featuring advanced
vapor chamber being that it is
constructed entirely from copper it's a
bit of a heavy sucker tipping the scales
at 329 grams just for the heatsink in
fact for a compact single slot card the
katana is surprisingly heavy weighing
603 grams in total finally under the
cooler we find a custom-designed PCB
housing the gtx 1070 GPU and eight
gigabytes of gddr5 memory gallic says it
uses higher quality components in the
construction of this card but doesn't go
into detail other than assay it features
an optimized electrical circuit what we
do find under the hood is a 4+1 vrm
which is the same configuration used by
in videos found edition model though the
vrm has switched sides of the GPU and is
now placed behind the display outputs
this layout means that the collects the
GPU section of the heatsink first and
then cools the inductors MOSFETs and
capacitors of the VRM
which can happily handle higher
operating temperatures because Galax has
gone with frequencies that are very
close to in videos or in specific
Asian they have stuck with the standard
single a pin PCIe power input
speaking of frequencies as the Box Galax
has pushed their base frequency to 1518
megahertz and this is a very small
increase over the stock fifteen hundred
and six megahertz frequency this has
resulted in a boost frequency at least
seventeen hundred eight megahertz though
of course GPU boost 3.0 will push the
frequency higher when gaming for example
the frequency was often seen hovering
around seventeen hundred and seventy two
megahertz but at times did drop down to
seventeen hundred and thirty four
megahertz when it comes to the splat
puts Gaelic has had to make a few
sacrifices due to the single slot design
here we find just a single DisplayPort
1.4 output typically you can find three
of these on a gtx 1070 accompanying that
single DisplayPort connector is HDMI 2.0
B and a dual link DVI output if you are
able to utilize all of these three
outputs then you still can support three
monitors simultaneously okay so that
about covers everything it's time for
the benchmarks please note our cable a
core i7 7700 kg system was clocked at
4.9 gigahertz and we did test the gtx
1070 katana both in its out-of-the-box
configuration as well as a custom
overclocked overclocked we push the core
to a base frequency of seventeen hundred
and nineteen megahertz and the memory
went to two thousand and two megahertz
that's a 13% increase for the core and a
10% increase for the memory this
overclock resulted in actual operating
frequency of 1949 megahertz when gaming
though we did have to increase the fan
speed to eighty percent and this did
make the card a bit loud anyway on to
the results as expected the gtx 1070
katana was a few frames filed in the
bigger beefier dual and triple slot ten
70s from pallet gigabyte and a soos that
said out of the box the performance is
still very respectable as the katana set
a few frames ahead of the founders
edition model not only that but
rendering an average of 90 FPS in
battlefield 4 at 1440p using the ultra
high quality settings is nothing to
sneeze at especially for a single slot
card moving a Far Cry primal would find
much the same the katana is able to best
the found Edition once again while
there's just a few frames we hung the
bigger partner card models something I
didn't point out previously is how the
car performs once overclocked
it's not going to beat Nova Club fuel
slot card but still hitting 60fps in
this test was impressive all the same
though again it was a bit loud with our
overclocked Star Wars Battlefront
doesn't provide anything we haven't seen
already so I'll wrap up the benchmarks
here score at least the graph results
and I'll move on to a few minutes of
gameplay then after that we will check
out the Federals and power consumption I
had a quick player in with battlefield 1
doom and pray let's see how the katana
got on
I didn't really know exactly what to
expect from the galaxy gtx 1070 katana
when it came to temperatures other than
I expected them to be high just how high
though was hard to say
however a two degrees I was pleasantly
surprised out of the box the card wasn't
even that loud the fact that it came in
a degree under the founder decision
while providing slightly better
performance is mighty impressive
overclock the card also hit 82 degrees
though the fan speed was increased quite
a bit and while far from reference card
layout it was still pretty loud for
those wondering I did check surface
temperatures with an infrared heat gun
and found the shroud towards the center
of the cartridge 44 degrees which was
surprisingly cool the cutouts are the
fan shroud where the hot air exits the
card did hit 56 degrees but even then
that's very reasonable now here are some
samples of the operating volumes
when it came to power consumption the
katana was very respectable consuming
only slightly more power than the
founders edition model even overclock it
still consumed less power than most
custom bored partner cards do out of the
box so a good result here well there you
have it the Galaxy etx
1070 katana a small or rather thin
graphics card that still gets the job
done while very impressive I guess it's
not totally surprising given they are
now cramming gtx 1070 and even 1080 GPUs
into laptops but hey it's still one of a
kind currently pricing is a bit of an
unknown you can buy it directly from the
Gallic store in the US for four hundred
and twenty dollars which isn't too bad
though the cheapest 10 seventies are
currently selling for around $380 right
now still given this is the world's only
single slot gtx 1070 you can't really
complain about the price it's hardly a
huge premium to pay anyway also keep in
mind once availability does improve
pricing will likely as well overall I
found the operating temperature and
volume very acceptable as the Box
performance is also great and the card
itself does look quite smart for those
seeking a slim high and graphics card
there simply is no better option I guess
you could argue those because there is
no other option but still it is a good
graphics card so that's it for this one
I'm your host Steve and do stay tuned
because tomorrow we will have that rise
in 1400 1600 and 1700 comparison I'll
see you guys then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
