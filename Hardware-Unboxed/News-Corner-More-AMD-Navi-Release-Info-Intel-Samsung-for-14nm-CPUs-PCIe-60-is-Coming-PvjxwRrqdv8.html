welcome back to the hardware box news
corner it's Friday so that means it's
time to go through the week's news and
just have a chat about what's going on
in the PC hardware space right now but
before that if you are a patreon
subscribe but I highly recommend
watching the latest behind the scenes
videos that we published this week
there's one each from Steve and myself
where we just discuss a whole bunch of
stuff related to the channel it seems
like people are enjoying them so go
check that out but yeah now let's get
onto the news the first story I want to
cover it relates to AMD's Radeon RX 5700
xt 50th anniversary edition which is
quite some mouthful of a cheap you name
if you remember this is aimed a special
edition of the RX 5700 xt that ships
with a black and gold cooler design and
comes slightly factory overclocked it's
set to cost 499 US dollars a $50 premium
over the regular version of the card now
I saw a news story this morning claiming
that the 50th anniversary edition of
this card will only be sold to those in
the United States and China through AMD
comm the source for this story seems to
be the French tech site Cal Copland
however in good news for those in other
territories I have confirmed with AMD
that the story is not true the 50th
anniversary edition is still a limited
additional product and it won't have
wide availability for example we won't
be able to buy one here in Australia but
it will be available to more than just
the United States and China in fact AMD
provided me with the full list of
countries most of European we have
Austria Belgium Czech Republic Denmark
Finland France Germany Ireland Italy
Luxembourg the Netherlands Portugal
Spain Sweden and in
kingdom and of course there's also
Canada I'm sure some people will be
disappointed that their country isn't in
the list AMD says that they are working
on expanding sales through OMB comm into
other countries but it doesn't sound
like this will happen for this watch
still significant parts of Europe should
be happy that the card isn't just
restricted to the US and China like that
report seemed to suggest Intel have
launched a new one-click
overclocking tool for their ninth gen
process is called the Intel Performance
Maximizer the idea of this utility is to
make it easy for owners of K suffix CPUs
to overclock and get the most
performance with that fiddling around
with the BIOS settings it works through
a fairly standard method of slowly
ramping up clock speeds and validating
each step through a stability test when
the CPU eventually crashes the software
drops down to the previous stable step
and tries it all again with voltage
tweaks until it finds that optimal
stable point all this is achieved
through a single button at this stage
it's only compatible with six ninth gen
processes the kora 9 in 9900 K in 1900
KF the core i7 9700 k + 9700 KF and the
core i5 9600 k + 9600 KF you also need
an overclocking capables n series
motherboard like I said 390 I'm not sure
why Intel's own 9th Gen Core i3
9350 KF 4 or older coffee like 8th gen
parts aren't compatible with the tool it
doesn't seem like these parts shouldn't
work but Intel does like to lock stuff
down to encourage upgrades to the latest
generation when using this tool Intel
warns you that overclocking is not
supported by the processors warranty and
then offers you what they are calling
the performance tuning protection plan
for 20 US dollars this plan gives you a
one-time return for any processor killed
through overclocking provided you bought
the processor as a boxed model from a
retail store those that have tested the
tool say it works well often pushing the
99 100 K up to a 5 gigahertz or Core
overclock depending on the silicon
lottery of course and often at
relatively low voltages Intel's future
plans for the tool include supporting /
core overclocking for optimizing
performance further and support for
future CPUs including those in the H ADT
line it's probably not something
enthusiasts overclockers will use over
manual tweaking but the tool
sound promising for those with current
Intel processes that can't be bothered
doing all the tweaking required to get a
good overclock while PCIe 4.0 is only
just now rolling out with Amy's third
gen rising processors and x5 70
motherboards the specification is
pushing ahead to PCIe 6.0 that's right
6.0 in 2021 PCIe 5.0 has just been
finalized in the last few weeks so it
makes sense that the PCI special
interest group is already at work on the
next generation of PCIe the key
improvement to PCIe 6.0 is a doubling of
bandwidth once again psi a 4.0 doubled
bandwidth from eight Giga transfers per
second per Lane to 16 Giga transfers per
second allowing for transfer speeds near
32 gigabytes per second with the time 16
device psi a 5.0 doubles it again to
32gb transfers per second which means
PCIe 6.0 will bring us up to 64 Giga
transfers per second so for PCIe 6.0 x
16 devices we're looking at 128
gigabytes per second of bandwidth the
development of PCIe has definitely
accelerated in the last few years well
we've been stuck with pcie 3.0 for years
now the spec was finalized in 2010 and
it took until 2017 to get PCIe 4.0 so
while the last spec upgrade took seven
years these days in just four years
we're looking at jumping up two whole
revisions it typically takes
manufacturers around two years to take
the PCIe specification and implement it
in new products psi 4.0 was released in
2017 and in 2019 we're seeing the first
products to use it starting with AMD
meanwhile intel has promised a piece a
5.0 chips in 2021 which is two years
after the specs released this year so if
a PCIe 6.0 we're looking at around 2023
for retail products with the spec being
finalized in 2021
if you're after more technical details
on what PCIe 6.0 is set to bring once
again I'll point you to an antique who
have all the relevant details they also
have a great article detailing the new
changes in another spec update nvm e 1.4
which I'm not going to cover here
Samsung are the first company to
announce a gaming monitor with a 240
Hertz VA panel the C 27 RG 50 is a 27
inch curved monitor with a 1080p
resolution and an eye
watering 240 Hertz refresh which is
certainly going to push the capabilities
of VA technology typically known for
slow response times to its absolute
limits I'm interested to see how this
panel will fare in the testing labs and
how close it gets to true 240 Hertz in
reality especially as Samsung according
a four millisecond response time which
is just barely fast enough for 240 Hertz
other specifications include support for
free sync plus Nvidia g-sync
compatibility it's a 1500 hour curvature
3020 contrast ratio and no HDR or wide
gamut support Samsung and launching the
panel mid July like a lot of new display
releases and it will be priced around
four hundred US dollars EA is a
never-ending source for great stories
just this week
EA VP Kerry Hopkins fronted up to UK
Parliament to discuss issues like loot
boxes and gambling in video games and
delivered this absolute gem of a quote
if you go to I don't know what your
version of target is a store that sold a
lot of toys and you do a search for
surprise toys you will find that this is
something people enjoy they enjoy
surprises it is something that has been
part of toys for years whether it is
kinder eggs or hatch normals or loss
surprise we think the way we have
implemented those kinds of mechanics and
FIFA of course is our big one our FIFA
Ultimate Team in our packs is quite
Ithaca land quite fun it is enjoyable to
people here trying to spin loot boxes is
merely surprise mechanics and climbing
that is quite a fickle and quite fun is
definitely a new I'm not sure I'll it'll
pay off for EA but hey at least they
tried Intel are not outsourcing some 14
nanometer CPU production to Samsung a
story did the rounds this week claiming
the Intel were in negotiations with
Samsung to produce 14 nanometer rocket
Lake processes in Samsung's fabs for
release in 2021 the reasoning behind
this was supposedly to alleviate some of
the strain on Intel's 14 nanometer
manufacturing facilities which are well
known to be at capacity and struggling
to keep up with demand but as it turns
out as confirmed by Tom's Hardware Intel
are not negotiating with Samsung to
manufacture CPUs they are in talks with
the company to shift some of their less
performance critical products over to
Samsung's fourteen animated tech like
chipset
for example but CPUs are not part of
this discussion and to be honest this
makes a lot more sense than in telling a
CPU line probably one that's been
designed specifically for Intel's fab
technology over to a third party Intel
has already rolled some chipsets back to
22 nanometers in the wake of 40
nanometer shortages last year and has
allegedly used TSMC for some outsourcing
in the past any time you told users of
third-party for manufacturing the deals
and details that typically kept secret
but the company has confirmed these
sorts of agreements have been happening
for some time anyway Intel's ongoing
challenges with their fabs continue to
be an interesting story and I'm eager to
see what happens when the company can
finally start shipping some chips on 10
nanometers which is supposed to happen
later this year final topic for this
week we have pricing information for
courses upcoming MP 600 PCIe 4.0 SSD
which gives us a bit of a taste of where
premium high performance SSDs will sit
in the market according to Cal Cal and
the MP 600 in its one terabyte capacity
has a price tag of 249 euros while the
two terabyte model sits at 449 euros
including tax this is in contrast to 160
euros for Corsairs MP 510 960 gigabyte
model and 320 euros for the 1920
gigabyte model so we're looking at a 35
to 40 percent higher price which I guess
isn't all that surprising given the
performance Coursera promising including
sequential raid speeds of up to four
point nine five gigabytes per second
whether or not you'll actually need this
sort of performance is another question
and I guess what to determine that and
based it on the workloads that you guys
are using that's it for this week's news
