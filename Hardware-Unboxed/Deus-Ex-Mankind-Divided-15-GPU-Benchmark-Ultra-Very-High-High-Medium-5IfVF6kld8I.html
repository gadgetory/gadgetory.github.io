introduction presumably if you hear
seeking the benchmark results then I
don't need to blab about the game or its
history so I won't instead let's get
down to business as quick as possible
this will be my most comprehensive
benchmark video of a new released title
yet really I'm hoping it'll be one of
the most detailed modern GPU performance
analyses you'll come across a few solid
days of benchmarking you went into this
so I hope you guys enjoy it
the focus has been on the built-in
benchmark tools since it does a pretty
good job of replicating actual gameplay
performance and the 90-second past is
very extensive it also makes the
benchmarking process much easier then
the annoying issue being that I have to
reboot the game every time the texture
quality was changed and since I've
tested with four different quality
presets I'd be completely exited game
four times to test each GPU on that note
I've also tested at 1080p in 1440p the
average of three runs was taking the
minimum frame rate to be very accurate
at this point I'm pretty much over the
built in benchmark having run the test
almost 400 times now anyway my standard
core i7 test rig has been used and I've
done my best to test all the current and
previous generation AMD and NVIDIA GPUs
the latest version one build five to
four point seven was used for testing
along with the latest AMD and NVIDIA
drivers for Windows 10 there's plenty of
data to get through so let's get into it
first let's see how mankind divided runs
when maxed out at 1080p
please note MSAA hasn't been used in any
of the tests in this video already we
start to get a sense of just how GPU
demand in the game is the gtx 1080 for
example average 262 FPS and remember
this is at 1080p something else you
might have noticed is how well the AMD
GPU is performed the Nano and fury acts
are both seen outperforming the gtx 1070
moving down the food chain we find that
those running previously powerful
graphics cards such as the Radeon r9 390
and GTX 980 will struggle with just over
30 fps moving to 1440p it becomes quite
clear that the gtx 1080 or fury actually
required for smooth performance even
then the fury axe does at times dip
below 30 fps pretty shocking performance
here for 1440p gamers but again keep in
mind how impressive the game looks
reducing the quality to very high does
boost performance noticeably the me
gpus such as the RX 470 unable to stay
about 30 FPS and deliver a decent 43 FPS
average still to break the 60 FPS
barrier for the average gamers will
still require the fury ax or GT x 1080
playing in 1440p using the very high
quality settings still wipes out most of
the graphics cards tested in order to
stay at or above 30 FPS at all times
games will require the gtx 980ti
gtx 1070 or nano high is what the
developer recommends all game is rocking
high and hardware used as a starting
point this makes sense because here the
RX 470 gtx 980m gtx 1060 averaged 54 FPS
while the 390x and gtx 980ti
are able to break the 60 FPS barrier at
1080p even with a high quality preset
enabled the GTX 1080 isn't able to
average 60 FPS at 1440p meanwhile
previous generation GPUs such as the GTX
980 and 9i 390 or force down to 30 FPS
at times those running GPUs on the lower
end of AMD and NVIDIA mid-range lineup
will ideally be looking at the medium
quality settings here the gtx 960
averaged 34 FPS while the RX 460
averaged 36 fps meanwhile the r9 380 X
in GTX 970 you were pushing around 50
FPS the new gtx 1060 in our X 480
average a little over 40 FPS at 1440p
using the medium quality settings while
the gtx 1070 and nano delivered over 50
fps here we've compared directly how the
gtx 1080 of pure EF scale using the four
tested quality presets in the case of
the 1080 we see a 23% increase when
going from ultra to very high then from
very high to high we see a further 14
percent performance boost finally from
high to medium we say our largest
performance gain yet a 24% jump
interestingly the margins on the fury X
are quite different from ultra to very
high just 13% more performance was found
meanwhile from very high to high we see
huge 28 percent performance gain and
then from high to medium a mild 9%
performance game before moving on let's
just take a look at how the slightly
lower end gtx 1060 and rx 470 scaled
again we see quite consistent scaling
from the GeForce graphics card the gtx
1060 found 19% more performance when you
only from ultra to very high a further
26% was found when going from very high
to higher and another 11% performance
from high to medium
the RX 470 for the most part offered
very similar performance and scaling
right now there are more than a few
gamers upset that their rigs can't
provide playable performance when using
the ultra quality settings
honestly the visual quality difference
between ultra and very high is almost
non-existent this is what I'd be aiming
for
however as suggested by the developer a
good starting point will be the high
quality settings here we found playable
performance with pretty much all the
GPUs tested at 1080p and even 1440p the
GTX 960 was the only graphics card to
really drop down to unplayable levels
and I hope this is just some kind of
driver bug on the whole the GeForce
performance was lacking though given
Deus Ex mankind divided is named a
sponsor title this isn't entirely
surprising still it's great to see a
modern cutting-edge game where AMD is
extremely competitive this is all the
more impressive given for now we can
only test using DirectX 11 though
DirectX 12 support is expected to be
patched in early next month unlike games
such as fallout 4 I've noticed that
mankind divided isn't a system resource
hog providing you have a modern
quad-core processor chances are the CPU
utilization is going to be very low as
the game isn't very demanding on the
processor the vast majority of the
strain is on the GPU given the game's
level of detail and overall image
quality the super demanding ultra and
very high quality settings don't
surprise me hopefully DirectX 12 can
help improve performance though I'm not
expecting any miracles so short of
running a high end GPU it doesn't look
like the ultra quality options are going
to be usable and I'm ok with that
we need more PC games pushing the limits
of the hardware and I feel that's what's
going on here rather than back to the
developer and call the game of rubbish
PC port I feel like the ultra setting
image quality does justify the
performance we're seeing what do you
guys think of these results are you
surprised by how demanding the game is
