updating my top 5 best CPUs list the
last time I made a video in this series
was six months ago and while I try to
update this series at least once every
six months so I suppose we're right on
time it worked out well actually as I
was waiting for the 9th gen core series
from in total and before making the
update and then I guess the Scarlet X
refresh that we pretty much knew what to
expect with that one so we now have a
few new 9th gen CPUs from Intel a few
new thread Ripper CPUs from AMD and even
a budget Athlon cpu as well we so many
options to choose from picking a CPU can
be a little hard so hopefully this video
will help the 5 categories are best
budget CPU best value all-rounder
desktop CPU a best value productivity
CPU a best performance gaming CPU I
can't really do 4 fingers that well and
then the best extreme desktop CPU so
let's get into the pics
first up we have the best budget CPU and
nothing has really changed here I'm
still sticking with my may pick the
horizon 322 energy before that back in a
June of 2017 I was recommending the
amazingly good value at least at the
time the intel pentium g 45 60 but of
course
times have changed in a rather big way
and ii recently released a $6 dual-core
of their own the Athlon 200 GE but it's
a bit of a lackluster part in my opinion
it does beat out intel's current pentium
lineup but the fact that it's a locked
processor and I'm not a particularly
impressive clock speed yeah the
performance isn't great I've recently
found that spending the extra forty
dollars to secure the 2200 G is a much
wiser investment as you get
significantly more performance for that
small increase in price and the
dual-core SMT enabled Athlon CPU it has
very little a Headroom and it's
virtually useless with a modern
mid-range GPU and therefore you will get
considerably more mileage with the rise
and three model of course the real
competition for the 2200 G comes from
the core i3 8100 which right now costs
about $30 more and it gets smoked
without a discrete graphics card and
then if you want to use something like a
GTX 1060 or rx 580 they both seem like
appropriate graphics cards for such a
CPU well they both deliver a similar
gaming experience then for productivity
workloads and general usage they're
pretty evenly matched
though once overclocked the 22 energy
generally comes out on top so for me the
fact that the Rison 322 energy is an
unlocked part and therefore can be
overclocked on an affordable motherboard
a can take advantage of higher clocked
memory packs a powerful integrated GPU
and is slightly cheaper than the core i3
8100 that makes it my number one budget
CPU Pig
well at the risk of being a bit boring
for this one I will be sticking with my
six-month-old pick once again this time
for the best of value all around a
desktop CPU last update I picked to the
horizon 520 600 or 2600 X over the core
i5 8400 and before that I went with the
horizon 5 1600 and that was in last
year's update so if you've got around
$200 to spend on a new CPU and you want
something that can handle any and all
tasks you throw it up with maximum
efficiency then the Rison 5 2600 really
is a must
back in May I noted that the core i5 I
was still an attractive alternative and
I said that it was a little cheaper as
it was at the time and it arguably
provided a better gaming experience or
at least better gaming performance I
suppose with certain graphics cards the
experience would be much the same anyway
it's crazy to look back on that because
today the Rison 5 2600 cost just 106
dollars u.s. while the core i5 8400 is
retailing for at least 220 dollars u.s.
making the Intel CPU almost 40% more
costly so again pretty crazy that it's
almost 40 percent more expensive given
that it was actually cheaper last time I
did my top 5 best gaming CPUs or top 5
best desktop CPU video so yeah that
choice is very obviously now the horizon
5 therefore right now I'm recommending
the Rison 5 2600 and I'm doing that
actually over the 2600 X you can still
go with the 2600 X but I think right now
the ultimate value best all-rounder is
the 2600 as a cost just 106 dollars u.s.
opposed to $220 that you'll pay for the
X model and with that massive saving I
recommend spending a bit more money on
your motherboard you could upgrade the
cooling and go for overclocking that's
also a valid option there but by getting
a better motherboard you will set
yourself up for the more serious 7
nanometer AMD CPUs next year so in short
nothing and I mean absolutely nothing
can hold a candle to the value of the
Rison 5 2600 at that hundred and sixty
dollar US retail price
it's absolutely bonkers how good value
this thing is right now so yeah if
you're after
a good value processor that's the one
I'd be getting well this is a bit
awkward six months ago now I picked to
the AMD Rison 720 700 or 2700 X is the
best of value productivity CPUs and
today I'm picking well just the 2700 C
that's a bit different right here you
can pick up the 2700 for it's about $50
US less than the 2700 X and with that
saving you can get a decent cooler and
that will allow you to get the most out
of the CPU that said I should just
quickly note that you don't need to
really overclock the 2700 X so you could
just get that and run it stock and not
mess around with overclocking and
upgrading coolers and whatnot or you
could just say $50 and forfeit a tiny
amount of performance and then get a
better quality motherboard which is what
I suggested with the 2600 and then
that's a pretty good plan for supporting
those upcoming seven nanometers in two
CPUs so in short for 270 dollars u.s.
the horizon 7 2700 pretty much smashes
anything and everything intel has to
offer in this price range especially
when it comes to productivity and the
core i7 8700 series still holds an
advantage in lightly threaded workloads
thanks to a clock speed advantage but
for seriously taxing a time-consuming
productivity workloads the extra cause
of the 2700 will hand it a real
advantage
the second gem rise and CPUs also took a
decent step forwards when it comes to
gaming performance and here the 2700 is
very respectable especially when paired
with the right memory as applications
continue to make better use of Rison
sevens many threads applications such as
Premiere Pro CC as an example we're
going to continue to see rising walking
away with it of course Intel now also
offers eight core 16 thread desktop CPUs
well they offer the 900k you can't buy
it it's really expensive but they do
offer it but the point is the horizon 7
2700 is just world's better value it's
almost half the price so because of that
and then AMD's commitment to the am 4
platform I feel like right now the Rison
7 2700
the risin 7-series really offers
shoppers the most bang for their buck
okay so the best performance gaming CPU
and obvious wean here for Intel but the
question is which Intel CPU do you pick
technically speaking the core Oh $9.99
or okay offers the highest level of
performance for gamers so I guess it
wins this category that said it all so
well you can't buy it so in order to
qualify for this category you first have
to be able to buy it and then secondly
it actually has to make sense and right
now you certainly can't buy the nono
okay at least not easily and it's
debatable as to how much sense it makes
at the $500 u.s. MSRP pricing really is
the main issue here and Intel fans don't
really seem to understand my position on
this one for gamers the 99er okay
doesn't really offer anything new or
anything extra in terms of formats at
best it's a few percent faster than the
8700 K and that is into obviously
today's games so they can't test future
games but those two extra cause it's
kind of a rise in seven situation it's
going to be a while before they become
useful and by the time they do they'll
be much better processors to buy so it
doesn't really justify the 35% increase
in price if you can buy the nine
Schneider okay at the $500 u.s. MSRP the
1900 Calladine motherboard and if you
want to achieve maximum performance
you'll also need to get a really good
cooler as well because it does run quite
hot when trying to hit the multiplier
table rather than being limited to the
95 watt TDP and I should just note at
the 95 watt TDP while it does run very
cool and extremely efficient more so
than the rise in seven processors it's
not really an upgrade over the 8700 K
for gaming of course if money's not an
issue and you just want a blazing fast
rig the most blazing of blazing fast
rigs possible then I guess the 9900 K is
the option to get however if you're
after a high-end gaming rig but it also
has to make sense then well you've got
to get the 8700 okay
it's really a much more practical cpu
and it's what I'd get if I was building
a new gaming system so I'm going to
continue recommending the Intel Core i7
87 or okay for now as the best gaming
CPU okay
finally a category with an updated pic
though it's not exactly radically
different
so in June 2017 I went with a core I 970
900 X though I did make it clear at the
time that I didn't actually recommend
buying that processor until AMD's thread
Ripper series arrived and we had a
chance to evaluate it but I did conclude
by saying if you must buy now and you're
aware that there is a competitor
incoming and she'll get the 1700 X it's
still a beast of a CPU long story short
the thread repair 1950 X arrived a few
months later and it became without a
doubt my number one pick for the best
extreme desktop CPU category it's true
that these 16 core 32 thread Koro 970
960 X is at times faster but it also
costs 100% more so you're paying 100%
more for roughly the same performance so
yeah I don't want to pick that one on a
technicality that it is technically
better because I wouldn't buy that CPU
then we have Intel's refresh the sky
like X refresh and the core I 998 20x
really isn't much better an $890 us it
can't hold a candle to the $900 thread
Ripper 2950 X which is the well the
thread refer refresh I suppose though
it's a bit more impressive them the
refresh that Intel is offering so anyway
the 2150 X is now my new pick for this
category that said I should just note
that the 1950 X is currently selling for
$600 u.s. and that is without question
the best value extreme desktop CPU right
now so if you can get one of those for
$600 u.s. or whatever equivalent that is
in your currency then I would certainly
recommend getting that as the 2950 X
really isn't that much faster
well there you have it my CPU picks as
of November 2018 the horizon 322 energy
is still the best choice for budget
shoppers there isin five twenty six
hundred
very obviously the best choice right now
in terms of price performance and
everything else hundred $60 us for a six
core 12 thread CPU is absolutely amazing
so yeah best value desktop CPU
hands-down then we have the horizon 7
2700 and the 2700 X and they really make
the most sense for those wanting to get
some real work done then for the
ultimate no compromise gaming experience
there's really nothing better than the
core i7 8700 K you could argue that
under most conditions it's not that much
different than the Rison 7 2700 X but if
you want to ensure maximum performance
in all gaming titles no matter what the
8700 K is the CPU to go for then for
those after extreme desktop CPU we have
the third group of 2950 extra place in
the outgoing 1950 X now as I mentioned
just a moment ago if you can snag a 1950
X for $600 US or whatever the equivalent
value is in your currency then that is
absolutely the CPU to be getting that's
an insane bargain anyway I hope these
picks have helped any of you who are
looking to buy a new CPU and let me know
if you agree or disagree with any of my
picks and you can do so down in the
comment section below I'll make sure I
read all of them anyway thank you for
watching I'm your host Steve see you
