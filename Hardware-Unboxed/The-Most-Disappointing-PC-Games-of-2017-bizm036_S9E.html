couple of days ago you might have seen a
video on the best PC games of 2017 and
if you haven't there will be a link to
watch it below it's nice to talk about
all the great games that were released
this year but we're also not going to
let's play the games that really
disappointed us and there's a few that
stick out this year like a sore thumb
once again we asked you guys what you
thought were the most disappointing PC
games of 2017 and we got a ton of
responses I've narrowed the list down to
five worthy contenders most of which
I've personally played extensively which
I'll be going through in no particular
order and king of this time is a doozy
easily the most controversial game
released in 2017 Star Wars Battlefront 2
when talking about battlefront 2 I do
want to mention that some aspects of
this game are genuinely fun the
multiplayer gameplay itself is a blast
and the presentation captures the
essence of Star Wars in such a brilliant
way there's a lot more content to enjoy
than its predecessor - which was
arguably a worse game in terms of its
gameplay but the problems with
battlefront 2 are numerous the
much-hyped single-player campaign is
very short and just complete garbage if
our modes is actually not worth playing
and the multiplayer progression system
is one of the worst in modern
multiplayer shooters it's confusing and
unnecessarily complicated with items
abilities and upgrades for both walked
behind odd barriers as a regular player
the progression system just doesn't feel
rewarding and doesn't do a good job of
incentivizing goals or unlocks and let's
not forget the pay2win system that EA
nearly thrust on us all if it wasn't for
the enormous outcry from the community
loot crate's you can buy with real money
they give tangible in-game advantages to
players have no place in competitive
games
it's a disgraceful money grab
particularly when the game itself
already cost $60 or more and while EAD
temporarily remove the ability to spend
real money on loot crate's at watch
there is no doubt you'll be able to pay
to win at some point in the future this
would have been a good game if the
progression system was completely
reworked without the focus on pay to win
mechanics instead EA chased the dollar
II dues and ruined the hard work of the
developers much to their annoyance I'm
sure
Mass Effect Andromeda disappointed
almost every Mass Effect fan looking
back I'm not quite sure why I played 50
hours of this game because it really
isn't that good the main story in
particular just wasn't that interesting
and butchered what could have been a
really interesting premise it takes a
long time to kick into gear as well the
best parts and most interesting worlds
are reached after around a 15 hour
opening slog which no doubt led to many
players giving up early into the game my
main issue with Andromeda is that in
many ways it just didn't seem like a
true
Mass Effect game the characters were
weak wooden and hard to care about not
helped by port animation the choices you
made throughout the story seem to have
very little impact and there weren't
enough of them and the game was also
padded out with tons of boring fetch
quests rather than compelling side
stories and its side quests that make or
break a strong RPG a huge disappointment
from EA and buy away in the end and
there's no doubt that the game suffered
from a horrible and painful development
cycle Middle Earth shadow of war is a
boring game the story is boring the
combat is dull and repetitive
particularly if you played its
predecessor shadow of mortal and the
ending is downright disgraceful oh and
there's lots of loot boxes with
microtransactions - to enjoy just to cap
off one of 2017 s great disappointments
it's a real shame shadow of war turned
out in such a mediocre state because
shadow of Mordor was a fantastic
innovative game that could have led to
an interesting equally inventive sequel
instead shadow of war is basically a
stretched out shadow of Mordor with a
couple of minor gameplay additions siege
battles are a lot of fun by far the best
aspect of the game and
was nice to see a larger variety of
environments but the Nemesis system
feels stale and the story isn't
interesting in the slightest and let's
take a moment to talk about the ending
for no other reason than to pad out the
game and incentivize lootcrate purchases
shadow of war gives you 20 consecutive
fortress defenses of increasing
difficulty 20 it's a 5 plus hour
repetitive grind you're better off just
watching the final cutscene it unlocks
on YouTube I'm not sure who thought this
ending was a good idea but it's a
disgusting finish to a very
disappointing triple-a game of 2017
everyone's least favorite game publisher
has entered this list for a third time
with Need for Speed payback so I guess
it's congratulations EA for having three
of 2017 s most disappointing games in
fact I'm not quite sure why EA continues
to make Need for Speed games as it feels
like the last decade of entries has been
subpar payback could be the worst entry
yet the story is laughably bad with
terrible characters though I guess that
isn't all that surprising for a racing
game the worst part of payback is that
it's not a very satisfying driving
experience especially compared to the
better racing games of 2017 and it
compounds that with grind filled
gameplay and a bad upgrade system it's
the last racing game you should play in
2017 if you're a fan of the genre and to
be honest EA should retire the series
for a while if it can't make good
entries anymore wait what you might be
wondering why we've put player unknowns
battlegrounds in our most disappointing
games list especially after we also
included it in our best games list of
the year well before you start slamming
the dislike button pub G was one of the
games you guys heavily nominated for
both the best and worst PC game of 2017
particularly on Twitter it's also a
great example of a game that gets a lot
of things right but lets down players in
other areas one of the key issues with
pub G is optimisation the
is not the prettiest and for some reason
even with the latest release runs
surprisingly poi on a range of hardware
AMD uses I hit the hardest whether they
have Rison CPUs or Radeon GPUs and while
those with Nvidia Intel systems fit a
bit better the frame rates you get out
of this game aren't great to say the
least it was easy to forgive pub G fees
issues in early access but despite a
large development team and plenty of
resources the game is still poorly
optimized even at the official launch
pub G also suffers from technical issues
and bugs
many of which seem connected to the
network code stuttering and rubber
banding is reasonably common at least
the last time I jumped in and there's
also problems like texture pop-in and
random graphical glitches pub G still
needs a fair bit of work to improve how
performs though the current technical
problems are not exactly going to stop
people from playing it's a ton of fun
despite the problems that's for sure and
I guess it's time to go into some
dishonorable mentions I'd guess you have
to call them you guys nominated a number
of other games for most dissapointing
including things like Call of Duty World
War 2 Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon wildlands
lawbreakers agents of mayhem which I was
looking forward to and just didn't seem
to be that good in the end and even
destiny too so there was no shortage of
games that failed to live up to the hype
in 2017 at least in your guy's eyes
maybe nothing quite as bad as the no
man's sky disaster of 2016
though loot boxes and microtransactions
certainly dominated discussions this
year hopefully a lot of the games we are
all looking forward to next year don't
turn out as disappointing as some of
this year's tiles I've just been talking
about if there's anything we've missed
I'm sure you'll let us know in the
