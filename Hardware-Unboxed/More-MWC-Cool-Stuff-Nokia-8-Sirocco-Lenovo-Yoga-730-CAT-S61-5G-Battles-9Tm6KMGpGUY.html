Congress roundup / hands-on video
covering the rest of the exciting stuff
on show in Barcelona to kick things off
in between a bunch of meetings I managed
to get some hands-on time with the
latest devices from hmd global under the
nokia brand while a previous Nokia
handsets since they entered the android
market haven't really caught my eye this
new set of phones which include the
nokia 8 Sirocco the nokia 7 plus and
nokia 6 are by far their best hardware
yet let's start with the nokia 8 Sirocco
which features a striking design with a
curved OLED display on the front and
curved clasp on the back the display
isn't 18 9 or any other fancy aspect
ratio instead of sticking to a 5.5 inch
2560 by 1440 panel but the bezels on
this device is still very slim while the
phone looks awesome the glass panels on
both sides are so aggressively curved
that the metal rim around the edge has
become very slim and quite sharp as a
result the phone is a bit hard to hold
and very slippery similar to the early
curved edge designs from Samsung I also
have a few concerns about the hardware
inside the phone has a retail price set
around 750 euros so definitely at the
high-end level however the Nokia 8
Soraka only uses a Qualcomm Snapdragon
835 rather than the new Snapdragon a 45
though you do get 6 gig of ram and 128
gig of storage as standard plus a 3.5 ml
headphone jack microSD card slot and
ip67 water resistance for the camera
were looking at a 12 megapixel
wide-angle primary camera with an F 1.7
lens plus an additional 13 megapixel
telephoto with an F 2.6 lens both with
exclusive zeiss and class inside the pro
camera mode is pretty neat but it's hard
to draw any conclusions about a camera
from such a short hands-on experience I
was pleased however the the Nokia 8
Sirocco and the entire line of new
devices uses stock Android 8.0 Oreo aka
Android 1 with 3 years of promised
updates perhaps the most attractive
device Nokia had on show both from a
visual and value perspective is the
Nokia 7 plus this is a 6 inch handset
with an 18 9 1080p
a display and a price tag of 400 euros
put it in the mid-range bracket
however the all-metal fasces is one of
the best I've seen with the beautiful
easy to grip black finish and
astonishing copper highlights this wood
really doesn't do the phone justice it
really has one of the best designs I've
seen in this sort of mid-range product
in the hardware inside isn't gonna wow
you with the Snapdragon 664 gig of ram
64 gig of storage and a large 3800
milliamp hour battery plus things like
you know USB C and a headphone jack it's
all typical mid-range phone components
here
however the camera is largely the same
as the Nokia 8 Scirocco aside from some
very minor changes the front-facing
camera though is actually better than
the Sirocco at 16 megapixels with a neat
low-light feature that combines four
pixels into one for bright imagery in
challenging conditions it might be
slightly too expensive compared to last
gen flagships and the bottom end of the
flagship spectrum but it is a really
nice piece of hardware
rounding out the rest of the main Nokia
phones on show is the Nokia 6 280 us
here we're looking at standard stuff 5.5
inch 1080p screen and a base 32 gig
storage with 3 gig of ram the rear
camera is just a single unit not
unexpected for a budget handset at 16
megapixels the build quality is also
very good though my preference does go a
little bit to the Nokia 7 plus here this
device could sell well though in the US
depending on the pricing over there and
expect these handsets to become
available in a few months time on the
laptop front lenovo were showing off
three new devices the yoga 7:30 in both
13 and 15 inch configurations along with
the yoga 530 otherwise known as the flex
14 in some markets compared to the
previous models in these series the main
upgrade here is the shifter intel's
eighth generation cpus which shouldn't
come as a massive surprise the 13-inch
yoga 730 model whacks a discrete GPU
while the 15 does get a gtx 1050 in some
configurations the yoga 530 uses an MX
130 again only in some configurations I
had some hands-on time with all three
laptops and the build quality of the
yoga 730 miles in particular really
impressed me the full metal chassis is
exactly
look for in top-tier laptops yet Lenovo
provides this at a sub $1,000 price
point in fact pricing starts at eight
hundred eighty dollars or nine hundred
dollars depending on whether you're
after the 13 or 15 inch models that is a
decent starting price though Lenovo
didn't confirm the actual base level
hardware you'll get instead mentioning
things like you can get up to a core i7
and a 4k display again the build quality
is quite impressive and the 360-degree
hinge has been reworked a little to make
the tablet mode more comfortable to hold
that said its primary use case is as a
laptop and even lenovo confirmed this is
what users prefer to use the vast
majority of the time both the yoga 730
models feature thunderbolt 3 though
oddly you get two of these ports on the
13-inch and just one on the 15-inch the
13-inch also charges through USB see
where the 15-inch does not due to its
discrete GPU options the 14-inch yoga
530 is naturally less impressive than
its more expensive brothers though
that's no surprise at its $600 base
price here we're getting a core i3 CPU
though the inclusion of an optional
NVIDIA MX 130 discrete GPU is great in
its 14 inch chassis it's a shame Lenovo
couldn't fit this into the 13-inch EOKA
730 the build here is mostly plastic
with metal around the keyboard and while
it looks nice most of the design degrees
have gone into the yoga 730 and also of
course the more expensive yoga 930 the
official launch date for these products
is just around the corner and it's also
worth mentioning I guess that you know
Amazon Alexa will be about 1 in some
markets if you care about that sort of
thing earlier I touched on the new Nokia
lineup and the budget Nokia 6 well ZTE
also announced a budget handset at MWC
the blade v9 which competes in the same
price bracket at 270 euros like the
Nokia 6 the build quality of the blade
v9 is very good for a budget handset in
my limited hands-on time with the phone
it feels really good and includes an 18
92160 by 1080 display where a lot of
budget phones are more sticking to 16:9
at the moment along with dual cameras on
the rear the blade v9 differentiates
itself by hitting all those 2018
smartphone buzzwords speaking of the
camera the blade v9s rear unit
a 16-megapixel main unit with 1/8 1.8
lens along with a 5 megapixel additional
camera for depth and detail information
again it is a bit hard to tell just how
good this camera is with that extended
hands-on time but it's good to see a
dual camera solution come down to this
sort of price point for phone that cost
more than 250 euros I was a bit
disappointed to see just a Snapdragon
450 SOC inside rather than something
from the 600 series storage and RAM do
start at 32 gig and 3 gig respectively
plus there is a 30 100 ml and power
battery those the ones something cheaper
can get the 180 euro blade v 9 Vita
instead with a 5 point 4 5 inch 18 9
display again and just a Snapdragon 435
SOC there is however still a dual camera
solution though we're now looking at a
13 + 2 megapixel combination neither the
blade v9 nor the v9 v 2 are slated for
launch in the United States currently
been Europe and Asia are in the launch
calendar Kat and Fleur seem to pop up at
MWC every now and then with a cool
product this time the cat s 61 which
improves upon the previous cat s 60 by
upgrading the thermal imaging camera and
adding additional sensors and features
for those that aren't aware the cat s 61
is a ruggedized smartphone designed for
workers with a built-in thermal camera
air quality sensor and laser distance
measuring tool the thermal camera from
Fleur now supports a wider range of
temperatures between minus 20 and plus
400 degrees Celsius and is a very handy
tool for those that need to find hot
spots in their work on the go
the air quality sensor properly known as
a volatile organic compound sensor
measures dangerous particles in the air
and provides a readout and warnings when
certain levels are reached or exceeded
there's also a temperature and humidity
readout pretty handy there the laser
distance tool is also very neat and
works with distances up to 10 meters and
provides accuracy to a tenth of a
centimeter with a plus minus 2 percent
tolerance these sensors and tools are
clearly the standout selling point
because the rest of the hardware isn't
that impressive using just a 5.2 inch
1080p display and a Snapdragon 630 SOC
though there is a 4500 milliamp
battery the phone itself is very chunky
as you'd expect for something ruggedized
and its price tag of 900 euros or a
thousand US dollars definitely makes it
a niche device for those that really
want those cool features and don't
really care about having you know
Snapdragon 800 series SOC is for example
a quick note on the HTC vive pro here
while the vive pro was announced at CES
2018 I did have a chance to use it in
conjunction with HTC's wireless adapter
and these two things were being shown
together for the first time at MWC the
headset is very impressive and the
wireless connection that seemed to work
pretty well you know with the increased
resolution and things that need to be
accommodated with the vive pro there
were a few glitches and stutters but you
know not too bad in general while Svea
is definitely the way to go with these
sort of things so I'm quite excited for
these products to hit the market and for
VR to continue although momentum has
slowed a little bit in recent years the
pro in particular with high resolution
displays awesome and the screen door
effect isn't nearly as pronounced as the
older vibe of course still no word on
pricing or a launch date here
rounding out the more interesting things
I saw at MWC there was naturally a lot
of discussion in demo surrounding 5g
what I found particularly funny it was
the battle between Intel and Qualcomm
with their 5g technology Qualcomm was
showing off an engineering prototype
phone with a millimeter wave 5g modem
transmitting data at more than four
gigabit per second the small antenna was
clearly visible on the device and
occupied just a fraction of the device's
overall sizes you can see here Intel
were also showing off a why 5g demo
their prototype connected tablet looked
very strange with massive flaps all over
the place which also apparently doubled
as antennas the guy at the demo booth
claimed these flaps were there as
kickstands or something but clearly they
were needed to be pointed in the general
direction of the antenna so not quite
sure whether he was telling the full
truth there Intel's prototype didn't
look as much like an engineering sample
as Qualcomm prototype it seems to be a
more finalized and device at least far
as these things are concerned but the
flaps weren't impressive to say the
least
Intel were also only using their 5g demo
to transmit a 4k video we
is something currently possible over
gigabit LTE and didn't really show off
you know the actual true capabilities of
5g in these next-gen networks just on
these demos it is pretty clear who has
the leading 5g modem technology at this
stage as we progress to 2019
availability anyway that's it for this
second and final round up from MWC that
we'll be doing this year perhaps not as
many launches and cool consumer
technologies as previous ease but
definitely still a few interesting
things on the show and we hope to get a
lot of the products that we've talked
about in these couple of videos in their
hands for review very shortly but until
then I'll catch you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
