corner it's been another big week of CPU
and GPU testing around here that tends
to be the case when a bunch of companies
launch products at the same time we
still got a ton of content coming up
over the next few weeks on some hotly
requested topics so stay tuned for that
but for now well let's look at some news
stories first up I wanted to take a
brief look at the CPU market and see our
prices for parts are stacking up after
the launch of AMD's third gen rising
series it's also good we're running this
segment on Friday and on earlier this
week because that's where a number of
CPUs got discounted for Amazon's prime
day so I think we're seeing well at
least what we see today is going to be
more representative of how these CPUs
will be priced over the coming weeks
what I'm happy to see is that rise in
3000 series CPUs are selling at their
MSRP we've seen from several Intel
launches in the past that low supply and
high demand can push up the pricing on
parts like the core i5 8400 or Core oh
nine nine to 900k but that isn't
happening with these rising chips a
quick browse on Amazon shows all parts
sewing at their MSRP although right now
the 3900 X is out of stock with a
similar story at new egg for older isin
parts the Rison 720 700 X did briefly
drop to $200 before the last week has
remained steady at two hundred and fifty
dollars meanwhile the rise in 727
hundred is two hundred dollars at
several retailers and dropped briefly to
one hundred and fifty dollars at Newegg
these prices are basically pinning AMD's
second gen eight core chips against
their gen 6 core CPUs which makes them
decent options for productivity but
perhaps not quite as good as third gen
for gaming horizon 520 600 is available
for around 125 US dollars which is a
great price for a 6 core CPU as is the
Rison 5 1600 for just a hundred and five
dollars both of these options will be
really suitable for budget builders that
just want to jump on the aim for
platform now and give themselves an
upgrade path to 3rd gen rising when they
can afford it or perhaps even future
CPUs we've only seen these low prices
for the past week or so and while that
won't give the same performances third
gen they're still a great option Apple
hundred and fifty dollars on the Intel
front the Koran nine ninety nine hundred
KF has been on sale at new week for four
hundred and twenty dollars but by the
time this video goes live I think that
sale will have just finished so yes at
times if you wanted Intel's eight core
CPU with no I GPU however it was only
last week that we saw the CPU hit four
hundred and forty dollars in a brief
sale so who knows maybe we'll drop in
price again the other big one to look
out for right now is the core i5 ninety
400 F which to be fair has been sitting
around one hundred and fifty dollars for
a while now at some retailers but
considering the standard list price is
more like hundred eighty dollars it'll
be an interesting battle between it and
some of the Rison parts the cry 5 9600
KF has dropped down to two hundred and
thirty dollars from its standard two
hundred and sixty dollar price in the
last few days at Amazon and Newegg
as well although again that sale might
be ending soon meanwhile the non F
models don't seem to be getting much
love on the price drop front in general
I think it's safe to say burn a great
time for buying CPUs and PC building
with prices like this hopefully we do
see more competition and price drops as
the year goes on I definitely think that
will be the case at this week's fortune
brainstorm tech conference Intel CEO
Robert Swan has talked more openly about
the reasons behind the company struggles
with delivering 10 nanometers on time as
many analysts have expected and known
about for some time someone admits that
Intel being overly aggressive with their
design for 10 nanometer led to delays
and issues Swann is quoted as saying the
delay was somewhat a function of what
we've been able to do in the past which
in essence was defying the odds at a
time when it was getting harder and
harder we set a more and more aggressive
goal from that it just took us longer he
also said that Intel prioritized
performance at a time when
predictability was really important
specifically someone said that the end
goal for 10 nanometer ended up being a
2.7 times improvement to transistor
density over last gen 14 nanometer nodes
which was a significant step above
intel's usual 2.0 x target over two
years having faced lengthy delays with
this sort of goal Intel is getting back
to 2.0 X scaling with their 7 nanometer
parts which Swann confirmed will be
available in two years in their belief
there is lots of road left in Moore's
law but as well
Intel looking at
ways to package chips for additional
gains some of that tech we've already
seen bit so there are still huge
question marks over how ten nanometer
will perform in its final iteration the
current theory is that there will be
some gains for low-power processes for
things like laptops and so on but it
seems that Intel might not be able to
clock these parts as high as with 14
nanometer which won't make 10 nanometer
all that well suited to high-performance
chips for desktop users still 10
nanometer CPUs in some form will
definitely be available later at this
year so yeah I'll be interesting to see
what they bring this next story is very
straightforward tweak town asked
invidious Jeff Fischer at the launch
event for the company's new g4 super
graphics cards whether there would be a
geforce r-tx 28 ET i super the answer
was there would not be so the 2082 i
super does not exist and this does make
sense
Nvidia already sells the titan ITX as a
super expensive higher tier version of
the 2080 ti with the 28 ET is sitting at
4352 cuda cores and the titan i TX at
4608 there wouldn't have been a lot of
room to move for the 28 ET i super other
than maybe offering the titan the ITX
core with 12 gigabytes of gddr5 or
gigabytes there were some rumors
suggesting a super skew for the 2080 TRR
in production but clearly this won't
eventuate into an actual product because
we seem to have an official word from
nvidia on this matter for some reason
once again stories of motherboard
vendors enabling PCIe 4.0 on older a m4
400 series motherboards are doing the
rounds while it does seem that some
currently available BIOS versions for
boards such as the tough B 450 pro
gaming from a soos do have PCI 4.0
enabled this is not officially supported
by AMD and will be blocked with future
buyers and a GC revisions so people with
these boards will soon be stuck in a
situation where they'll have to choose
between the latest optimizations for
Rison processes and PCIe 4.0
compatibility aim these official
position remains that PCIe 4.0 is
exclusive to x5 70 boards as they cannot
guarantee the 400 series boards will
have their required signal reliability
for PCI 4.0 to function correctly over
time we expect that these motherboards
will have PCI 4.0 disabled with already
BIOS so it's nothing to get excited
about and certainly we choose the ladies
of G subversions
over PCI 4.0 for most people Toshiba
memory is getting rebranded with a new
name of cheok SIA at the start of
October yep a brand that has a fair bit
of traction in the memory market will be
completely erased and replaced with some
random name that no one has ever heard
of Toshiba do say the new name is a
combination of the Japanese word for
memory which i think is pronounced
kkeok sue and the Greek word for value
which is Axia but still to me it doesn't
seem like a great name so kkeok SIA is
the new brand name for the second
largest nan manufacturer in the world
there are also plans for an IPO in the
works after the company was sold to Bain
Capital in 2017 for a massive 18 billion
dollars Toshiba memory also still
recovering from a significant power
outage that affected a huge amount of
non production that we covered in news
corner not that long ago Igor from
Igor's lab has managed to get a Radeon
rx 5700 XT running at 2.2 gigahertz
through an SP PT mod SP PT is short for
soft power play table and using it is
kind of an interesting way to overclock
basically AM buddies driver reads a
power play table from the bios of the
GPU and writes that into the Windows
registry to form a soft power play table
from there you can go in and modify the
SP PT 2 raised power limits which lead
to higher clocks of course with this
sort of mod you should have a highly
capable cooling solution like a liquid
cooling box that you don't run into any
film problems when you do raise that
Powell in it Igor playing around with
the plus 95 percent power limit on the
RX 5700 XT as well as a hike or
overclock although despite being listed
as plus 95 percent it didn't actually
double power consumption instead there
was only a small game to around 250
watts under load up from 215 watts and
in his shadow of the Tomb Raider
benchmark this was enough to take the RX
5700 XT from performing below in RTX
2070 super to performing near the level
of the r-tx 2080 founders edition stock
this sort of overclocking ya won't be
for the faint-hearted but it just goes
to show how much is still left in the RX
5700 XT if you have the cooling capacity
final topic of this week intel has been
secretly offering a super high
performance version of this
on platinum server processes but it
hasn't been visible in the intel's arc
unless you know the specific model
number only search for it officially the
highest part intel lists is the xeon
Platinum 80 to 80 a cascade Lake server
chip with twenty eight cores a base
frequency of 2.7 gigahertz and a maximum
turbo clock of 4.0 gigahertz it is a two
hundred and five watt TDP and retails
for a touch over ten thousand US dollars
unless you need the models with higher
memory support which cost even more
however as it turns out there is a
higher model available the xeon Platinum
8284 it provides a 300 megahertz
increase to the base clock and in doing
so raises the TDP to 240 watts however
for the privilege of this small clock
speed increase you'll be slugs for at
least a 1 K unit price of fifteen
thousand four hundred and sixty dollars
so yeah it costs roughly five thousand
five hundred dollars for that frequency
pump given the chip is not in Arkham
less you know the exact model number
this is typically going to be available
only to select customers perhaps even as
a custom order the pricing might also
sound ridiculous and in some ways it is
but serve the customers can be willing
to pay enormous prices for small
performance improvements depending on
their setup and needs that's it for this
