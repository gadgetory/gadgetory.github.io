speaker market it's tough to take a look
at any new product and say wow this is
really more than a Bluetooth speaker at
a glance the IRA on deck looks kind of
just like a black and orange e gold
color drawer - with a new ring on top
however I know to expect much more as
creative a claim that this is the most
intelligent speaker on the planet with
twice the power of the original roar and
twenty hours battery life now amazingly
the frontal lobe of this mobile
operation is the same sound blaster a
double x1 digital audio processor that's
found in the creative sbx family of
sound cards and speakers meaning we've
got some serious high-quality digital
processing onboard this equipment allows
the eyeball to do fancy things like make
real-time adjustments to the sound
expand and partially rebuild compress
audio and deliver optimized low-end of
various volume levels on top of this
it's all programmable creative or even
providing a software dev kit that allows
artists and producers to provide
listeners with a small file that can
customize the irods audio processing and
performance at the lowest level pretty
amazing this high in sounds then
delivered to its environment through a
set of creatives all new drivers up
front there's two lightweight one and a
half inch mid and high range drivers and
then handling the low end is the
dedicated upwards facing two and
three-quarter inch sub woofer driver
rounding out the sound delivery are the
two passive radiator drivers found at
each end of the speaker's similar to its
predecessors these new drivers use
neodymium technology with more efficient
magnets which help keep the iris size
down this is all in case in the
pneumonic oak or one-piece endoskeletal
chasis to ensure there's no I wanted
vibrations or shaking impressively all
this audio Hardware amounts to a package
of the way isn't it just 1.1 kilos or
two-and-a-half pounds making a very
portable unit overall to me the IRA
really does look like a future iteration
of the raw and raw to before it it's
like the porch to the predecessors
Volkswagens the overall shape is rather
similar but there are some distinct
differences
probably most notably the passive
radiator panels that once were have now
been replaced with a slightly receded
speaker grille that matches
the front and top of the speaker this
means that you don't get that cool
visual effect during heavy bass but it
looks nice overall I think we can live
without it on top the uninterrupted
speaker grille has been saddled with a
large black ring that allows easy and FC
pairing and it lets us know that it's
designed by creative to control buttons
at the top rear have been upgraded to
adaptive and contact sensitive
intelligent touch controls meaning
depending on the selected mode of the
speaker the applicable buttons will
light up and offer their functions first
is an actual pressable power and
bluetooth pairing button followed by
mode switch full playback controls and a
record button the Royal button is next
followed by mic beam mic mute phone dial
and end and finally the volume controls
all of these touch buttons are
responsive and work rather well they
certainly make the entire device look
and feel more premium to completing the
top of the device is a subtle hot blow
LED display that shows you what's
happening on the device at the time
along with dual array microphones for
recording and phone calls around the
back you find the remaining inputs and
outputs at the left is the power input
followed by the USB audio port next to
that we have the micro SD card slot and
a toggle for shuffling or simply looping
the media on it there's a three and a
half millimeter audio in Jack and
optical import and finally a
one-and-a-half amp USB charging port for
charging other devices such as your
smartphone it's cool to have all these
options for import especially the
microSD card and optical jack in my
opinion the overall look and style of
the IRA is great it's stylish and
professional and Friends that I showed
the speaker to were immediately
impressed the IRA manages to look as
premium as it is it only comes in one
color way at this stage and it's a
colorway that I'm honestly a big fan of
the deep blacks are sleek and the
metallic orange features really set the
design off the red featurettes are the
final fierce touch on an all-around
impressive design the self-proclaimed
smarter speaker in the world comes with
the wealth of features as it expect and
customization is the name of the game
most of the control and interaction is
handled by the AI ROI Android and iOS
apps we were able to do a multitude of
interesting things first there's a group
of pre-configured profiles to suit audio
situations such as game on for gaming
audio file blitz but unmodified music
Cinemania for movies and a couple of
others using the equalizer function you
can also quickly slide bass and Trevor
levels up and down to suit your audio in
your personal preference on the flyer
with the immersion function you can
control how directional the sound spread
is which I don't find too useful
personally there's a dialog + function
that improves speech clarity in
particular for podcast movies and games
to the smart volume menu offers two
pretty cool functions also auto mode
makes sure that playback is always at a
consistent volume even at low levels and
night mode makes midnight movies less
disruptive to your household by reducing
the impact of explosions and other loud
events but also keeping dialogue and
other sounds of an audible level there's
also a variety of add-ons you can
install through the IRA app too with
these you can enable functionalities
such as an alarm clock a metronome a
jukebox and more creative has a software
development kit the eye roll - that will
hopefully lead to some talented
developers creating some pretty cool
apps and add-ons for IRA users quite
interestingly the IRA has its own PA
function so long as you opted for the
extra IRA or mic which is available for
80 US dollars the mic is small light and
can conveniently clip onto your shirt or
pocket easily you can also connect an
external mic through a little input jack
on the bottom of the mic - if you've got
another mic that you want to wirelessly
transmit to the speaker the mic
functionality doesn't end there either
there's a line import - so you can play
music through the mic wirelessly to the
speaker and lastly port wise is the
micro USB charging port the face of the
mic features speaker volume controls mic
sensitivity controls and finally the
emerg button the battery in the mic
should last 10 hours and you also get a
little foam windscreen to plug onto the
top of the mic this cleverly stays put
with a small magnet
performance-wise the mic was pretty cool
I did have some feedback issues if I was
too close to the speaker however and I
could see this being a potential issue
if you're going to use it to make your
presentation for example in some ways
this PA function is a really cool
feature but I do struggle to see
situations where I personally find it
very useful it is fun to mess around
with and with the emot-- button you can
put your voice through a variety of
pretty funny filters including chipmunk
orc alien emo and more if you're into
karaoke then you might have fun with the
mark but in terms of using it as a
hey the speaker is not really loud
enough to cover a large area more than
most people could just yell instead the
ten meter range of the mark means you
can't really use it to communicate from
afar either
for me the best use I can think over the
PA function was to hide the speaker
behind the couch or under the bed and
prank people with a chipmunk voice funny
a couple of times but maybe not worth
the $80.00 however a separate app named
remote assistant allows you to access
and control media stored on the micro SD
card connected to the speaker itself
this is pretty nifty as before your
limiters are simply the media playback
buttons on the speaker itself with no
ability to see track names select
individual songs or see what's playing
next in terms of the SD card you can
also record your voice to it directly
and access these recordings through the
app - now let's talk about the sound
performance as mentioned the IRA
features five drivers powered by one amp
to one and a half inch front-facing
drivers handle the majority of the mids
and highs and powered by separate amp is
a two and three-quarter inch upwards
facing driver that handles most of the
low range additionally to passive
sideways facing drivers help deliver
more bass and more spread of sound
admittedly I haven't tested a lot of
Bluetooth speakers in this sort of price
range however I can comfortably say the
I row is the best portable speaker I've
ever heard
the sound produced is nice and even with
a good spread amongst lows mids and
highs and the sound dispersion is
excellent you don't need to be sitting
in the exact right spot in the room to
get the right sound above around 75%
volume the low-end sound becomes a bit
lacking but having said that this is a
very loud speaker and the high quality
sound lasts into much higher volumes
than you'd expect from a speaker of this
size one thing we didn't have on hand to
test was the eyebrow Rock an external
sub woofer the IROC can quickly and
easily dock onto through a connector on
the bottom of the device this is a cool
option to have and I can imagine users
leaving the subwoofer in their living
room and docking the IRA for added bass
and full-bodied sound for movies and
music in particular the eye-roll packs a
mighty battery inside to 9,000 milliamp
hours will give you up to 20 hours of
play time depending on volume and mode
and you can also charge your phone or
the I roll mic for example from a - as
mentioned all-in-all the IRA is a pretty
amazing piece of hardware on the back of
the sound quality and appearance alone
it was an absolute pleasure to use and I
was very keen to show it off to everyone
in anyone with
in earshot the functionality of the Iero
is unprecedented as far as I know and
the ability to customize the sound and
more through the mobile apps is really
quite cool the eyebrow is listed on
creators website for three hundred and
seven US dollars and six hundred dollars
in Australia so it's far from cheap this
is not the speaker for the non
discerning listener that just wants a
quick sound solution however it is the
solution for the audio enthusiast wants
a wealth of customization an exceptional
digital audio processing and their
fingertips so is the eyebrow a Bluetooth
speaker you'll be considering why why
not let me know in the comments or an F
format Hardware on box comm thanks for
tuning in for another product review
I look forward to seeing you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
