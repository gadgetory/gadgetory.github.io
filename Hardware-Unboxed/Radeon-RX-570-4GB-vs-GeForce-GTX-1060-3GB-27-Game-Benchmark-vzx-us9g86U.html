revisiting another mid-range GPU battle
this time between the Radeon rx 574 gear
button geforce gtx 1063 gigabyte it's
been a little over a year since we last
compared these two in an epic
head-to-head battle so I thought it was
about time we took another look since
the original comparison we've received a
multiple driver and game updates as well
as quite a few new games which we've
been able to add to our benchmark list
of the 27 games that we'll be testing in
this video just half a dozen of them
were featured in last year's battle last
time at the Radeon rx 570 was 2 percent
slower overall so a very even fight
there currently the RX 570 does cost
around $10 us more than the 3 gigabyte
version of the gtx 1060 and for
reference it should cost 170 dollars us
while the gtx 1060 should cost $200 us
today though the 1060 starts at $230 us
while the 570 starts at $240 us so like
all graphics cards they were actually
better priced a year ago representing
the green team is the msi geforce gtx
1063 gigabyte x3g and for the red team
the msi radeon RX 570 gaming x 4g
although both models are pretty heavily
overclocked down in the box we're still
going to squeeze every last bit of
performance from them with a custom
overclocked stock the RX 570 game X
comes clocked at 1280 one megahertz for
the core and 17 hundred and 50 megahertz
for the gddr5 memory we were only able
to increase the core clock to fourteen
hundred and thirty five megahertz a 12%
core overclock and the memory to 1900
megahertz a nine percent overclock and
just as a side note under vaulting
didn't help us achieve a greater
frequency or hold higher boost
frequencies as for the gtx 1060 gaming
x3g it comes with a base core clock of
fifteen hundred and sixty nine megahertz
and in the gddr5 memory is clocked at
two thousand and two megahertz we were
able to hit 770 megahertz for the core
and this resulted in a boost frequency
of about two thousand one hundred and
fifty megahertz depending on load the
memory also achieved 2,275 megahertz
so a 13% core overclock and a 14% memory
overclock now as mentioned earlier we
have 27 games in total all of which have
been tested at any pay using both stock
and overclock configurations however I'm
only going to discuss the results for
eight of the games and then jump into
our performance breakdown the rest of
the grass will be available for free on
our patreon page and the link will be in
the video description I'll probably also
add it as a pinned comment as usual our
course our GPU test rig built inside the
crystal series 570 X has been used and
inside we have a core i7 8700 K clocked
at 5 gigahertz with 32 gigabytes of ddr4
3,200 memory I realize this hardware
configuration is overkill for these GPUs
the idea here though is to remove any
potential system bottlenecks that might
mask GPU performance ok
so I think that's about everything let's
get to the good stuff first up we have
the battlefield 1 results and here the
gtx 1060 was 6% faster out of the box
and 11% faster once overclocked so a
clear win here for NVIDIA but it has to
be said the RX 570 still puts on a show
delivering well over 60 FPS at 1080p
using the maximum in-game quality
settings
unfortunately Nvidia still hasn't
addressed their underwhelming breakfest
performance now this is allowed AMD to
rear end of them in brutal fashion as
the RX 570 provides up to 45% more
performance more critically the RX 570
average 60 FPS out of the box whereas
the GTX 1060 3 gigabytes struggled to
break the 40 FPS barrier moving on we
have Tom Clancy's Rainbow six siege and
this is another title that really favors
the red team here the RX 570 beat the
GTX 1060 by a 36 percent margin out of
the box
Varian video was able to reduce that to
a twenty seven percent margin in favor
of the RX 570 once both GPUs were
overclocked although far cry 5 is an AMD
sponsored title we saw a little to no
bias upon release both the Radeon and
GeForce GPU is performed as expected
here we see the GTX 1063 gigabyte is
slightly faster in the RX 570 out of the
box and 11% faster once overclocked
Fortnite is built upon the Unreal Engine
4 and therefore has a natural tendency
to favor hardware from the green team
here we see the GTX 10
providing 15% more performance stock and
then 17% more once overclocked still
it's worth keeping in mind that we are
using the maximum in-game quality
settings at 1080p and still seeing well
over 60 fps
at all times using the rx 570 Total War
saga thrones of Britannia is a newly
released title it plays very well on
both AMD and NVIDIA hardware that said
the GTX 1063 gigabyte has a reasonable
performance advantage as it provided 11%
more frames out of the box and 16% more
once overclocked still it has to be said
there was no shortage of frames at 1080p
using either GPU moving on we see that
AMD's ARMA 3 performance has improved at
a site in the past year and although the
rx 517 was slower than the GTX 1063
gigabyte it was only seven percent
slower out of the box and provided well
over 60 FPS at all times the last game
that we're going to look at is Warhammer
vermintide 2 and this is another title
that plays nicely with AMD Hardware here
the RX 570 sped out 70 FPS on average
out of the box and that made it 13
percent faster than the GeForce GTX 1063
gigabyte when it comes to power
consumption the rx 570 does suck down a
little more than the GTX 1060 it's at a
natural disadvantage here being the die
is 16% larger so not that surprising
that we see a 19% increase in total
system consumption still even when
overclocked we're only seeing system
consumption hit around 332 watts and
that includes a core i7 87 okay clocked
at 5 gigahertz so with a lower end CPU
it's unlikely you're gonna see system
consumption climb above 300 watts ok so
from that small act game sample we did
see a bit of back and forth which is to
be expected now though it's time to get
the full picture by looking at the
results across all 27 games okay so in
stock out of the box trim the GTX 1063
gigabyte was on average 4 percent faster
than the rx 570 not a big margin that
but it has grown by a few percent since
we last compared the two so the 3
gigabyte 1060 is still kicking along ok
at 1080p the 1060 enjoyed solid wins in
GTA 5 Warhammer - Assassin's Creed
origins and battlefront - it was less
impressive when testing with rat fest
and Rainbow six siege then with both
graphics cards overclocked the GTX 1063
gigabyte extended
lead after 8% I was now able to deliver
considerably more performance in six of
the title's tests in providing in excess
of twenty percent more frames we also
see that losses in titles such as rec
fest and Rainbow six siege were also
reduced so if you plan on overclocking
your graphics card the 1060 is a very
attractive it also consumes less power
and because of that it does run at lower
temperatures though the temperatures
will vary from one model to another so
we haven't focused on that data here
again for those of you who are
interested in seeing the actual frame
rates for those 19 games that we didn't
look closely at please check the link in
the video description which will point
you in the direction of our patreon page
and it is free to access all the graphs
there as for picking one of these GPUs
and working out which one's best for you
well it's probably going to come down to
the games you play as one model might be
a little bit better than the other
depending on the game a bit overall the
experience was very similar in almost
every title we tested that being the
case last time out I did say there was
no right or wrong choice yeah it's just
too close to call and that is indeed the
case again in 2018 so really I would go
with whichever one is cheapest that
being the case I do personally gravitate
towards the GTX 1063 gigabyte at the
moment and that's for a few reasons and
I'll admit part of me is a little bit
annoyed about this because I'm not happy
about the naming of the three year byte
model it's not merely a gtx 1066
gigabyte with half the memory it's
missing an sm unit which takes the
cruder coil count down from 1280 to
eleven hundred and fifty-two this means
despite having the same name it actually
features 10% for your cause I've
expressed my dismay for this quite a few
times in the past so I won't bang on
about it here as frustrating and
misleading as it is it doesn't change
the fact that the three gigabyte 1060 is
actually still a really good value
product a fact is right now it is
slightly cheaper than the rx 570 while
offering slightly better performance in
our tests so if I had a little over $200
u.s. to spend on a graphics card right
now that is the model I would be getting
as a side note if you can afford to pony
up the extra $50 or so for a fully
fledged 6 gigabyte model then by all
means do so but at 1080p there's no
chance you're going to see 20% more
performance so in terms of cost
frame the three gigabyte version really
does offer much more value and finally
if you'll want to take advantage of
adaptive sync technology then the RX 570
makes more sense as free sync is more
affordable but as Tim has found in the
past your experience may vary from
display to display so make sure you do
your research and that is going to do it
for this one if you did enjoy the video
