your host Matt and today we're looking
at logitech's flagship surround sound
speaker system Bizet 906 I've personally
been a longtime user with Logitech's
previous flagship model deserve 5500
it's been really good as a
one-size-fits-all solution for gaming
movies TV music basically anything I
could throw at it
admittedly I'm not a massive audiophile
but I do like a good system when I hear
it and I do love having plenty of volume
at my disposal Zen 9:06 is ready to walk
in 500 watts RMS which is going to be
plenty for anyone in that bedroom or
living room I know the Z 5500 is
happening for me let's open up the box
now take a look inside as you can see
it's a pretty big heavy box up top we've
got just the instruction manual it's
pretty smart packaging so a little bit
of cardboard here holding it together
and then you've actually got two handles
so you can slide out the subwoofer box
pretty easily so take a look at that
first
alright now let's take a look at the
subwoofer itself so it's actually it's
an 8 inch side firing port and subs
wow this is actually 2 inches smaller
than theirs at 5500 which was a 10 inch
sub it's actually got slightly less
power as well rated it's 165 watts
compared to the 187 on the z 5500
fitting it round get all your inputs
along the back and the color-coded
speaker wires and you'll also notice
compared to the 5500 you don't have the
amp and the big heat sink on the outside
that have actually fitted that inside
the box this time and hopefully there's
no heat issues we've got the power cord
just pretty much it so it's a little
understated nice black sleek design
which should fit into your living room a
little more subtly than the out of their
5500 box did popping open the other
internal box so on top we've got a
little remote control so only a few
buttons on this guy and honestly it's
really light pretty well very cheap
feeling if I'm honest just sort of matte
smooth plastic and it takes three Triple
A batteries which is quite a lot good
news logitech has included the batteries
funds you've just got level volume up
and down affect power in select input
and the mute button and that's it
here's the bundling speaker wire it is
only 18 gauge speaker wire however you
can slot in thicker wire if you wish
over 18 gauge can be plenty for
mainstream users which is product is
aimed at here the speaker's themselves
satellites and the centre's
so um I was pop one out of the plastic
just 335 watts RMS coming out to these
five speakers which is a lot it should
be plenty it's more than theirs at 5500
ton
design-wise I like these these are nice
so on the bottom we don't have feet um
or stand there's just these two smooth
rubber pads which is nice design is all
black and it matches the sub this should
fit into your living room a lot better
than there's a 5500 stood they don't a
silver and try to sort of I don't
they're going for a fancy look but they
don't really look like sleek and premium
this will fit in with into your living
room a lot better I feel yeah quite
weighty and on the back is active
actually included a bit of screw thread
so you can mount them to wall if you
wish although there's a mounting gear
included we have to supply that yourself
we've also got just the plain three and
a half mil audio jack cables here and
lastly we've got the center console
control so pop that open for you so what
I do like is this is stackable with all
your other entertainment units so the
longer platter some portrait design
Funds wise we've got power you can
select your input here so there's six
you can have up to six inputs which is
pretty cool you can choose the effect so
if you select in the decoding system
there we've got a mute button and level
there are some LED lights in there all
orange on this device this actually
shows you which of the speakers this far
away and of course we've got just a
volume control in the middle so it
matches the rest of the styling just
sleep black pretty subtle and
which is nice now the moment I've been
waiting for let's plug these in see how
they sound if you are going to set up
the system in your living room and watch
movies in the dark then you might find
the standard LEDs a little bit brighter
than the center console and be
distracting I thought if they're going
to go with the premium sort of advanced
field and an LCD screen like on their
5500 probably would have been a better
choice my only other complaint usability
wise was the remote control like I
mentioned earlier it's pretty ugly cheap
and tacky feeling and I thought Logitech
could have done better
performance-wise Z 906 as much as you'd
expect from Logitech and I thought it
really fits the current 330 dollar bill
you have plenty of base clear mid-range
and more distortion feed volume than
you're ever going to need in your
bedroom features wise while 6 inputs was
plenty
I thought the lack of a HDMI
pass-through was real that down in an
oversight by Logitech especially on a
product that's trying to infiltrate the
living-room screw threads on the rear of
the speaker was a nice touch you could
improve it on the dead 5500 and I also
like the Logitech stuck with standard
speaker wires overall you're looking for
a powerful system to use with your PC
you could also use in your living room
if you aren't expecting movie theater
quality and the Zen 9:06 could be the
way to go this has been Matt from
