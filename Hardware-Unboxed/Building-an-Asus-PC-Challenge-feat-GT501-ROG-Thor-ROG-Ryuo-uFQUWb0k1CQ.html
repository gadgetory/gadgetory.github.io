we're going to be making a gaming PC not
quite sure what kind of gaming PC but I
do know it will have a heck of a lot of
suits hardware so that being the case
firstly let me just get this other way
this is not sponsored content a soos did
provide the hardware for free but that
is the extent of it so they approached
me said would you like to build a PC
using a lot of our new hardware and yeah
I said what sounds like a lot of fun so
let's do it better be crystal clear I
was not paid to make this video but stay
if free hardware is getting paid well
then if that's the case then I guess we
have been paid for almost every video
we've ever done on the channel so yeah
sure let me be a little more specific on
that one we aren't getting paid using
any recognized currency and we can do
whatever the hell we like with this
hardware that is to say there's been no
rules or guidelines set by a soos and
let's be honest I always do whatever the
hell I want anyway so getting to the
actual build on hand I have what looks
to be a rather somewhat random
assortment of hardware like I said a
soos just approached me they said we
have a new case we have a new all-in-one
liquid cooler and a new power supply and
yeah we'll put that together with some
other hardware that we're quite well
known for such as graphics cards and
motherboards and you can do a build so
yeah that's pretty much what's landed us
here but yeah they throw in the tough
Zed 390 + gaming Wi-Fi so a motherboard
that supports Intel processors and then
the ROG Strix gtx 660ti which is a
graphics card that supports games does
so quite well and then they've also
teamed up with team group we would like
to do a lot of yeah I won't use that
that pun anyway this provided some tough
RGB memory so that should go pretty well
with our tough motherboard and then we
have a tough SSD so yeah it's gonna be
pretty tough and since we do have an
Intel as it 390 motherboard and a GTX 16
DTA I thought probably a perfect pairing
for this kind of hardware combo would be
that new core i5 9500 F processor that I
just purchased for the comparison with
the horizon 5 2600 so that would be a I
think that's fair to say that would be a
perfect fit for this build but then I
realized we have this guy a 240
millimeter all-in-one liquid cooler and
it doesn't really make sense to throw
one of those on a locked Intel CPU will
be nice and cool and quiet but probably
overkill a 20-dollar air cooler will
achieve pretty much the same thing on
that part so that being the case I
sprung for another new processor the
core i5 9600 K and quite shockingly I've
never actually tested or reviewed that
CPU before so yeah I thought this would
be a pretty good opportunity to snag one
for future testing with that sorted it's
time to get building so while I put this
thing together I'll talk about the parts
used rather than play some background
music first up let's talk about the
tough gaming GT 501 case this thing is
an absolute beauty and despite being
released late last year I really haven't
seen that many reviews or builds using
it so I'm glad we can check it out
obviously looks are subjective but for a
gaming focus case I really do like the
look of this thing what's not subjective
though is the price and at 140 dollars
u.s. it's certainly not cheap but for a
case of this build quality size and
design it's not outrageous either
granted something like the fractal
design mesh fic is much cheaper at
around $90 u.s. but you don't get quite
the same level of features inside the GT
501 comes with three 120 millimeter or
RGB fans pre-installed and there in the
front there also rated for 1,200 rpm and
then there's a single 140 millimeter PWM
fan in the rear you can also expand upon
this setup with 3 120 millimeter fans or
2 140 millimeter fans in the top of the
case as for radiators you can fit up to
a 360 millimeter out in the top or front
with a 140 millimeter rad in the rear if
you're not interested in liquid cooling
then the case can support up to a 180
millimeter tall air cooler as for the
graphics card there's really no length
limit here as you can put graphics cards
as long as 420 millimeters and the same
kind of applies for the power supply 240
I will fit just fine for storage there's
for two and a half or three and a half
combo drive cages and then adjacent from
the motherboard tray there are three two
and a half drive bays oh and for the
motherboard you can fit up to a 12 inch
by ten point nine inch extended ATX
motherboard a soos calls this thing
their mobile battle station and despite
weighing almost eleven kilos and that's
empty they encourage you to Logan around
with a pair of woven cotton carry
handles and they say these are safer
transport up to thirty kilograms so who
said computer nerds don't workout
getting this build started I quickly
installed the core i5 9600 k processor
onto the asou stuff is added 390 +
gaming Wi-Fi motherboard along with the
16 gigabyte kit of team groups T force
Delta tough gaming RGB ddr4 3200 cell 16
memory the mother board costs $180 us
and only features a basic four phase vrm
and for less the gigabyte Zed 390 or SLE
it offers a true six phase vrm so I'm
not necessarily recommending the tough
model especially at this price point but
it is what we're using for this seuss
theme to build I haven't personally
tested this motherboard but that is
something I can do in the future with
the motherboard processor and memory
install I decided to hook up the Isuzu
ROG Ryu 240 millimeter all-in-one liquid
cooler since we already have three fans
pre-installed in the front of the case
and the GTX 1660 Ti doesn't really dump
that much heat I've decided to top mount
the radiator forcing the heat generated
by the Core i5 processor at the top of
the case the cooler is another
reasonably expensive item costing 155
dollars u.s. though to be fair that
makes it cheaper than similar specter
items from Corsair there are cheaper
models though available from the likes
of Coolermaster deep cool EVGA and a Max
and Thermaltake for example so make sure
you check reviews comparing those models
then powering everything is the lowest
end power supplier soos offers the
beastly rog Thor 850 it's an 80 plus
Platinum 850 watt fully modular RGB
power supply with a live - OLED panel
and a 10 year warranty so naturally it's
not gonna be cheap two hundred and five
dollars for this one so yeah certainly
not cheap if you want a cheap 850 watt
power supply again get something like
the
horse scx 850 MV 2 or the BitFenix
whisper em they both cost just $90 and
even if you want a platinum rated model
there are much cheaper options such as
the g.skill PS 850 p or the corsair HX
850 both of those cost just one hundred
and forty dollars us for around the $200
mark so the same price as the Isuzu unit
you can get 1200 watt units from FSP and
Thermaltake such as the tough power
grant RGB 1200 watt that said none of
these units have an oled display so
depending on how much importance and
value you place on that
the ROG thought might be worth the
asking price next i installed the team
group t force delta s tough gaming RGB
SSD into the bottom mounting position
for this build we only have the 250
gigabyte version and it sells for around
$50 u.s. that said though I'd never
personally buy this particular model as
you can get twice the storage capacity
for $20 more so a 40% increase for a
hundred percent more storage so yeah
just get the 500 gigabyte version of the
T force Delta s but it is a pretty cool
SSD with the RGB lighting I kind of
mocked the whole are GB SSD thing with
Tim when he first used it but in this
case it does look kind of cool and be
kinda nice if we had three because I
think that would look pretty spectacular
in this one then lastly I hooked up the
ROG Strix gtx 660ti this is an awesome
quality 1660 TI that I have reviewed on
the channel though again it is a premium
product in at 325 dollars u.s. it is a
bit of a tough sell anyway we've now
pieced this thing together it's time to
run a few stress tests and see how it
performs okay so here's my complete all
seuss build or at least as a soos as you
can possibly make anyone build and I
think it looks pretty good I think most
of you guys will agree it's not too
over-the-top not too gamer II but it is
meant to be pretty gamer ish and I think
it's yeah kind of a nice balance there
it's not yeah too ridiculous anyway I
quite like it let me know what you guys
think in the comments section below if I
were building this computer here or a
similar computer for myself or for a
friend
change too much but I would change the
power supply
the ROG thought 850 it's a really
nice-looking power supply actually it
looks quite spectacular really even when
it's not turned on but as impressive as
it looks
well it's pointless in this build isn't
it because as you can quite plainly see
or can't see there's a plastic shroud
over the power supply and you could opt
to not use the plastic shroud but this
one of the advantages of this case is
that big basement section I was pretty
pretty loose and wild with the cable
management on this one just quickly put
it all together and shoved everything
down there on the back side of the case
with the door off it looks quite good
because everything's just stuffed in
there so you have to spend a lot more
time and energy making all the cables
nice and neat if you wanted to show off
your power supply but yeah anyway I
think in this build it is just way too
expensive and yeah a bit pointless
because you can't see it anyway as far
as I can tell the power supply is very
higher-quality so if you're building a
higher end more expensive rig then it
probably would make sense to use
something like the ROG thought but in
this instance you can easily buy a
similar quality power supply for about
half the price and that being the case
that's what I recommend you do
especially for a PC like this that's
worth around $1500 us I was pretty
impressed with the all-in-one liquid
cooler that's got some neat features you
can see the temperature here that looks
kind of cool really high-quality
resolution there and yeah you could
change the logo and do a few things but
that and performance was great so the
system peaked at 88 degrees in a 20
degree room and that was after an hour
of prime 95 and most crucially I should
note that that was with the 9600 K
overclocked to 5 gigahertz seemed to do
that really easily and yeah I think 88
degrees in prime 95 after an hour with
the 9600 K at 5 gigahertz is a pretty
respectable result from a 240 millimeter
all-in-one liquid cooler after I mean I
was in a bit of a hurry to get this
build done so I could move on to other
things so I just applied the 5 gigahertz
profile in the tough is ed 390 + gaming
Wi-Fi motherboards by ah
and that worked really well just applied
that one setting Reber of the system and
I was at five gigahertz it did apply at
one point two seven volts that's it was
perfectly stable there but you could
probably get that 88 degree load tamp
down a little bit with a bit of voltage
tuning because I reckon it would run
with a bit less voltage but anyway for a
one sort of click tune option that's
pretty impressive and you could run this
system 24/7 with that overclock applied
without a problem
as for the ROG Strix GTX 16 60 TI well
that thing ran really cool as expected
because it has well it has an extreme
overkill heatsink on it really it's just
a massive gtx 1660 Ti and I have
reviewed it so we know what that one's
all about it ran at 57 degrees and full
load after hour of gaming and the vrm
hit 43 degrees so very very cool card
there that's a few degrees cooler than
what we got in a Corsair crystal 570 X
test case but the room temperature was a
few degrees cooler as well so basically
the same results we saw in our review of
that card so yeah really cool and quiet
card there whether it makes sense
spending that much on a GTX 1662 oh well
that's a completely different matter we
discussed that in the review so if you
want to know more about this card then
check out our review of it as for gaming
benchmarks not going to bother with any
of those because well spoiler alert the
GTX 1660 Ti performs like a gtx 660ti
and we've done plenty of gtx 660ti
benchmarks on the channel so I don't
think we need any more when paired with
a core i5 9600 K at 5 gigahertz there's
no CPU bottlenecks there so you can
expect the full performance that we've
shown on the channel already in the end
some really great temperature results
there I don't believe this case has any
air flow issues seem to pump a lot of
cool air through it and coming out the
back there and as I said everything
around nice and cool so yeah personally
I really like the gt500 one really nice
case getting a little bit pricey
probably not the most competitively
priced case and it's sort of mid tower
range but it's unique looking the build
quality and design are excellent and
it's extremely easy to work with like I
said that big
shroud the basement section that made
cable management very easy these plenty
of cable management room on the back as
well comes with lots of fans
pre-installed and ya ever I think it's a
pretty solid offering from a soos I
think this might be their first ever
standalone case but not home resent sure
on that one anyway it's quite a good
offering and yeah with these little
handles on top it makes makes
transporting it relatively easy I mean
it is a complete this is just over 20
kilos but yeah you can uh you can pick
it up and carry it off with relative
ease and that is going to do it for this
video hope you guys enjoyed my all soos
build challenge thing yeah turn down a
bit better than I thought was going
until I thought we had a real mismatch
of components there but the 9600 K with
the gtx 660ti it's not a bad combo you
could go with an RT X 26 DNR TX 2070 or
even an RT X 2080 with that CPU and get
pretty good performance again it's
probably not my first pick for a CPU I'd
probably rather save a bit of money in
this price range again something like
the rise in 520 600 X makes a little bit
more sense and it's got 12 threads so it
may age a little bit but anyway that's a
that's a whole different thing that I
don't want to get into for this one
enjoyed the build it was a lot of fun
and it's certainly a really good gaming
system so you wouldn't be disappointed
with that but not really a build guide
either because like I said I wouldn't
use that power supply a few other things
but anyway that's that's really it for
this one I'm looking forward to going
back through some benchmarking we have a
really cool livestream coming up later
in the week if Tim can get better
you guys might have missed news corner
on Friday a few other videos were meant
to come out from Tim but he is very very
sick at the moment poor little guy
hopefully he will be better soon of
course I'm giving him lots of support
and all that sort of stuff but yeah
hopefully he'll be better because
Thursday we want to do a live stream
build off we're going to do we're gonna
build a system each for Computex that
we're going to take in a bags a carry-on
luggage so a desktop computer now that's
going to be interesting a whole lot of
fun and hopefully Tim recovers so we can
do that Thursday because it was meant to
happen today but it didn't so
thank you for watching if you liked the
video like it subscribe do all that
stuff I'm your host Steve and I'll see
you again next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
