Lee processes landed and sadly it hasn't
all just been a mistake 1750 US dollars
is the correct price for the 69 50 X so
that's disappointing to say the least
thankfully there are alternatives with
those seeking core heavy machines and
there's they on e5 2670 that I looked at
more than three months ago now is still
one of the best options given processes
can be had second hand for as little as
60 us or 80 Australian dollars each and
there's still a massive oversupply I
recently landed a pair for 150 Ozzy
which included shipping additionally I
spent five hundred seventy dollars plus
shipping on a brand-new dual socket
Super Micro
ME dx9 dr3 motherboard from newegg.com
and a further two hundred dollars on 32
gigabytes of ddr3 1866 memory all up the
guts of this workstation builders
totalled nine hundred twenty dollars so
not bad given the 59 60 X cost $1500
alone and the new 69 50 X is staggering
2550 for my American viewers the bulk of
the dual xeon e5 2670 system came to a
total of six hundred and sixty dollars
so the question that remains now is how
well do the dual xeon e5 2670 s tackle
professional level video editing and
premiere pro CC let's find out these
results are based on a Premiere Pro CC
workload provided by Intel based on
professional level video editing using
4k 30fps h.264 mp4 footage recorded a
bit rate of approximately 80 megabits
per second the input file sizes total
1.9 gigabytes in total 2 minutes and 21
seconds the audio stream is 1536
kilobits per second 48 kilohertz 16-bit
stereo and wav format the performance
test measures the time to export the
entire clip to a 4k h.264 mp4 format and
the output is a high quality 4k video
file the benchmark is GPU accelerated
using the new geforce gtx 1080 the
results while not mind-blowing are
impressive for roughly the asking price
of the car 750 960 X it's possible to be
able to complete joule xeon e5 2670
workstation receive a similar level of
performance in total we were only seeing
around 60 to 70 percent CPU utilization
on the dual Xeon system so there's more
performance to be had in applications
that can take advantage of all 16 cores
with the hyper-threading support clearly
the 69 50 X is a better option in terms
of performance when compared to the dual
Zeon's its hands down faster more fuel
efficient and of course can be
overclocked for even greater results
still as I've made abundantly clear by
now the price is a real stinker and as
such the 69 50 X is far from a
cost-effective means of arming a
workstation with more than eight cause
this is where the dirt-cheap xeon e5
2670 processors come into play still in
order to really take advantage with the
extra processing power you'll want to be
working with very high quality source
files professional-grade stuff really
the 6950 x becomes an even harder sell
when you factor in the full system cost
of the dual xeon build everything's
shown in this video is in the xeon build
total just shy fourteen hundred US
dollars or two thousand Australian
dollars that includes two xeon e5 2670
processes the Super Micro dual soccer
motherboard to knock to AU 12 DXi for
coolers 32 gigabytes of ddr3 memory
Silverstone ST ADF power supply and the
massive landlady a thousand workstations
chassis so you could build this system
or pull out another four hundred dollars
out of your wallet to buy the kora 769
50x and of course that buys you just the
processor anyway thanks for tuning in to
your another Hardware unbox video let me
know what you guys think in the comments
I'm your host Matt as always and I'll
see you guys next time youtubers</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
