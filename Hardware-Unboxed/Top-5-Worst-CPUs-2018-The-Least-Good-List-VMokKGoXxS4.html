weeks ago now I put together a top 5
best CPUs video at the time hinted at
the possibility of a follow-up top 5
worst CPUs video I did know at the time
though that I didn't really feel like
there was enough bad CPUs to justify
that content but boy was I corrected in
the comments section
quite a few of you also pointed out the
CPUs don't necessarily have to be bad
rather it could be a list of the top 5
least good CPUs currently available and
that didn't really have the same ring
so I've stuck with the top 5 worst title
which essentially means the same thing
it's worth keeping leashed good in mind
though is almost none of the CPUs tagged
in this video are actually bad and
they'll likely have something about them
that isn't particularly consumer
friendly or there's just better options
currently available remember this is
just a bit of fun if you have one of
these CPUs don't be offended we're not
saying you're stupid or anything like
that for buying one I'm sure you have
your reasons you big dummy
anyway remember it is just a bit of fun
so let's get into it
we didn't tell release the coffee like
series or at least part of it back in
October last year everyone was focused
on the core i7 8700 km core i5 8600 ok
mostly because those are the two main
parts that Intel sampled the core i5
8400 was also creating a bit of buzz but
I always came to check out the core i3
range which were essentially 7th gen
Core i5 s so i pre-ordered both the core
i3 80 183 50k and this allowed me to get
the first review online for these
cheaper coffee-like CPUs I concluded
that review by saying even considering
the overclocking abilities the 83 50 K
is a poor value proposition priced at
170 dollars u.s. it really wasn't much
cheaper than the core i5 8400 and in
fact it cost more once you factor in the
price of a basic air cooler making
matters worse is the fact that a basic
air cooler won't actually allow you to
achieve the 4.9 gigahertz overclock that
I did given the low temps I was seeing
4.5 gigahertz seemed more reasonable
with the basic air cooler and that's
just a mere 13 percent bump in frequency
from stock so at best it will match the
core i5 8400 while ultimately costing
more consuming more power and running
much hotter I also noted that this makes
the core i3 83 50k a worthy successor to
the 73 50k they both sucked equally and
respect to their own private lines you
could argue that for those that only
require 4 or less high clocked high IPC
cause the 83 50k is the perfect solution
and while that's a reasonable case to
make I feel like for the vast majority
there are much better buyers to be had
for around $200 u.s. such as the core i5
8400 or now horizon 5 2600
obvious choice I know but I just had to
include at least one KB like X processor
especially now that intel has axed this
cpu series less than a year after
release I don't really recall the last
time Intel or AMD discontinued a cpu
model less than a year after release of
course this move probably surprises very
few of you as the core i5 7640 X and
core i7 7740 X within most pointless
CPUs released possibly ever although
both KB Lake X models or a complete joke
the core i5 70 640 X was a real rube
particular you know that core i3 8350 K
that I just finished ripping into well
today the 70 640 X is essentially that
CPU on Intel's high-end desktop platform
so that means you have the ability to
put what is essentially a 170 dollar CPU
on a 200 dollar plus motherboard but of
course unlike the id3 50k the 70 640 X
doesn't cost 170 dollars nope
it costs 250 dollars u.s. boy that
cracks me up every time I say it 250
dollars u.s. for a fork or for thread
CPU it's not just the price or the fact
that we're talking about putting a quad
core on a high-end desktop motherboard I
mean yeah those two things alone are
hilarious but the real gold comes when
you realize the fact that only half the
memory dims on that expensive x29 board
can actually be populated and you have
just 16 PCIe lanes to play with and not
the 28th or more you get with a scar
like X CPU
speaking of sky like X let's move on
I have to admit I never really did like
the core i7 Serac's that much and as of
October 2017 it was rendered completely
pointless by the faster cheaper and more
efficient core i7 8700 K the only
advantage of the 700 X over the 8700 K
are those extra PCIe lanes but few users
will notice or probably more to the
point take advantage of them it's more
likely that you'll see those using a
core I 9 processor running multiple
expensive nvme SSDs and raid 0 for
example anyway with the exception of the
PCIe lanes daddy 700 K really is a much
better CPU and the low latency ring bus
method of connecting cause makes it a
vastly superior choice for gamers if you
do want to jump on the Intel high-end
desktop platform then you really should
ignore everything below this 78 20x but
even that chip does come under heavy
fire from the horizon 720 700 X and at
that price point I do much prefer the
thread Ripper 19:50 X and while I
actually prefer that chip to pretty much
anything Skylar X promise I'm not trying
to trigger Intel fans but I am aware of
how this video is shaping up
finally a bit of AMD hey-oh I was
worried about how this was going I admit
this one pic probably isn't really going
to level the playing field but not
really interested in that I was tossing
up between the risin 5 1500 X thread
Ripper 1900 X and of course the entire
Bristol ridgeline up from 2017 which for
some reason AMD refreshed on the am4
platform last year I know quite a few of
you do like the 1900 X but for me it's
never really made sense at $450 us there
I just find it a seriously tough sell
then we have the four core eights red
rose and five 1500 X and I tested the
hell out a thing I launched and found
that the horizon 5 1400s was just a much
better buy and today it probably makes
even less sense 160 dollars us that's
the 1500 X because we have the risin 5
2400 G which admittedly in its own right
doesn't make a huge amount of sense but
it is still a better buy than the 1500 X
and that is because you get the
integrated GPU that packs entry-level
discrete graphics card performance
anyway before I risk confusing myself
any further the real stinker here from
AMD was the a12 900 and by extension the
entire bristol ridge lineup which
included parts such as the athlon x4 and
970 950 and 940 let's not sugarcoat it
they sucked big time and made almost
less sense than the core i5 7740 X quad
cores might be going out of fashion fast
right now but for cause based on the
excavator architecture came in and went
out of fashion in 2016 the only plus
side being they've saved quite a few
users thanks to Amy's boot program for
those of you that have bought a new AMD
Rison CPU with a motherboard that hadn't
been updated to support the accompanying
processor aimed he decided to mail out
one of their almost useless bruh storage
APIs to boot the system up so you could
update the BIOS and then use your eyes
and CPU so I'm sure Bristol Ridge has
managed to save the day a few times but
for those who actually bought one well
they're probably a bit less impress
now this is a pic that I expect to set
the comment section alight and submit my
status with some as a true AMD fanboy
I know risky stuff this but I'm going
for it anyway and if it plays out poorly
I can always blame patron member salcat
for talking me into it I have to admit
though he put forth a good case for the
locked core i7 processor and this is
something I think everyone AMD fans
Intel fans and more importantly those of
you like myself who were just passionate
about PC Harbor in general but don't
want to see the consumer taken advantage
of so the key issue here is the
worthless box cooler which sees the 8700
throttle even under ideal conditions as
a result for most there are better ways
to get the same level of performance
while spending less
I think the arisin 5 2600 X for example
for those of you unaware I did take an
in-depth look at the 87 or outperforms
with the Box cooler and a video not too
long ago with no limits imposed by the
motherboard the Box cooler will allow
the 8700 to reach over 90 degrees in a
room with an ambient temperature of just
21 degrees this becomes a serious
problem as most motherboards
tug around 80 degrees particularly the
blower and more affordable boards and
this means the 8700 thermal throttles to
maintain temperatures and I found this
reduces performance by as little as 10%
but as much as 20% of course this issue
can be solved with a $20 air cooler so I
know there'll be many of you that are
like Steve what's the big deal and well
I get that but even so I'm not gonna let
Intel off the hook on this one I need to
start pairing their CPUs with coolers
that allow for maximum performance and
while decent operating temperatures so
this pick is more about the Box cooler
bundled with the six core 12 thread CPU
than it is about the core i7 8700 well
there you have it my least good CPU
picks for 2018 the only truly awful CPU
to make this list in my opinion was
aimed as a 12 900 and by extension the
entire Bristol ridgeline up I mean just
imagine buying an a 12 900 for 110
dollars us late last year only to
discover the rise and 322 energy a few
months into 2018 that's almost a worse
place holder than the Intel KB Lake
x-series when it comes to terrible
values though the overpriced Core i5 70
640 X really
just take the cake that's an ultra
expensive placeholder with terrible
resale value just a handful of them have
been sold on eBay in the past month and
they fetched less than a hundred and
forty dollars u.s. ouch
at least the core i3 eighty-three fifty
K has some kind of upgrade path but it
is hard to argue that the 8100 wasn't a
better investment if you do plan to
upgrade to a Core i5 or i7 processor in
a year's time then we have the core i7
700 X which is obviously quite capable
it just got completely mugged on both
sides by the 8700 K and r7 2,700 x or
the 2600 x if you want to save a bit of
money again the core i7 8700 is also a
great processor sadly though it's let
down by the industry's worst box cooler
I mean come on Intel it's time to pull
your finger out and come up with
something better I'm sure it won't take
too long and that is going to do it for
