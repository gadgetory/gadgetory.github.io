today's video we are revisiting an old
friend
ahem DS radeon r9 290 hard to believe
it's four years old now of course a lot
has happened in that time but I can
still recall testing the 290 for the
first time like it was yesterday
AMD handed me what was at the time a
very aggressive looking graphics card
back in October of 2013 and having been
hugely impressed with their Kepler based
Titan crusher for 290x just weeks prior
I was keen to see what their much more
affordable 290 had to offer
in short AMD did end up cutting their
lunch a bit on that one as they usually
do they went after large volume sales
rather than large profit margins and I
guess that's why most enthusiasts love
AMD in summary the 290 X and it's 550
dollar US MSRP was already considered to
be shockingly low at the time it was 15%
cheaper than the GTX 780 despite being
10% faster in addition to costing 45%
less than the GTX Titan that right there
looked to be a solid win for AMD yet
despite that just week later they drop
to the 290 which consequently dropped
the 290 X from the wish list of MOS
enthusiasts the unknown 290 came in an
MSRP of just $400 US making it 27% more
affordable than the 290x that made a
fantastic W when you consider the r9 290
should never be more than 9 percent
slower than the r9 290x in fact it was
on average just 5 percent slower
according to my own testing so in a
sense the r9 290 made the r9 290x
redundant much like the GTX 780 did -
the Kepler based GTX Titan as good as
the 290 was it wasn't without a few
shortcomings IMD's new 290 series ran
very hot hitting temperatures as high as
95 degrees after just a few minutes of
gaming naturally this caused the cards
fans to spin up and if they couldn't
deal with the thermal load the cards
throttles and this means they down clock
themselves to reduce the thermal output
that consequently reduced performance at
the same time this issue was mostly
solved by the board partner cards and a
good example of such a card is the
gigabyte are known to 9
Oh see that I have on hand gigabytes
massive wind force 3x jewel slot cooler
was capable of dissipating up to 450
watts of heat so back in 2013 the r9 290
went on sale for the then low price of
$400 u.s. now four years later they can
typically be purchased on the
second-hand market for around 150 to 200
dollars u.s. the question is though
should you purchase one for that price
and how well does it handle today's
games well in an effort to find out
we'll be taking gigabytes model and
throwing a dozen games at it
testing will take place at the 1080p
resolution using high to ultra higher
quality settings four six or twelve
games tested we do have hard data which
can be compared to similar new graphics
cards while we just showing gameplay for
the other six games please note the
gameplay footage shown was recorded
using a capture card on AMD Verizon v
1400 test system overclocked to four
gigahertz meanwhile the data you see in
the graphs was recorded using the cable
eight core i7 77 Eric a test system
clocked at 4.9 gigahertz apart from the
use of different hardware there is also
joining the graphs and actual gameplay
footage can't be directly compared as
different quality settings were often
used while different sections of the
games were also used for testing keeping
that in mind let's move on to see what
we found first up we have battlefield 1
and here the r9 290 was good for an
average of 80 FPS at 1080p using the
ultra quality preset that's a seriously
impressive result and it meant the 290
was still quicker than the RX 470 and
GTX 970 if only by slim margin it
crushed the war budget focused gtx 1050
Ti and wasn't a great deal slow in the
GTX 1063 gigabyte and rx 484 gigabyte
graphics cards moving to actual
multiplayer through John the Rison v
1400 test system we see the frame rate
top at somewhere between 65 and 75 FPS
for the most part let's watch a little
more battle till one action before
moving on
enemy team is in the lead the r9 290
does struggle a little in Mass Effect
Andromeda using the ultra quality preset
though with an average of 45 FPS the
game while still playable still the r9
290 does trail the RX 470 in this style
that was still a good bit faster than
the GTX 750 Ti as you would expect given
it is a much larger GPU that consumes
much more power anyway moving on to the
single-player footage on the horizon v
1400 test system I reduce the quality
settings to the higher preset frame
rates did still dip as low as 45 fps
though this was previously the average
frame rate and the average is now 55 FPS
which did allow for a smoother
experience and you fucked up use the job
jet to be happy and celebrate we could
rather fool again seek my life give it a
minute we can probably do both I'd make
that fight here I was a cop in crisis
response yeah how'd you over a beer
sometime
testing with overwatch saw the r9 290
match the RX 470 and come in just behind
the eye rx 484 gigabyte so a decent
result remember testing done here was
recorded on the core i7 77 RK clocked at
4.9 gigahertz so the footage you're
about to see using the much cheaper
Rison v 1400 won't be seeing the same
frame rates anyway let's move on and
check out some multiplayer footage which
I recorded with me running around as
soldier 76
I don't play overwatch so I'm not the
best sadly I just don't have time to
play games at the moment anyway as you
can see frame rates are a bit lower in
this multiplayer test using the Rison v
1400 clocked at 4 gigahertz still we did
see an average of 110 FPS and this is
still a very respectable result and
obviously the game was very playable and
extremely smooth
goodbye break I've got you in my eye
using the core i7 7700 key test system
the r9 290 did very well in rise of the
Tomb Raider rendering 91 FPS on average
this placed it alongside the GTX 970 GTX
1063 gigabyte rx 480 and well ahead of
the RX 470 moving on we have some
gameplay footage from a much more
demanding section of the game called
geothermal Valley even so the r9 290 was
able to push over 60 FPS for the most
part and again gameplay was very smooth
the division is a very demanding title
with the ultra quality preset enabled
here the r9 290 average is 53 FPS but at
times did dip as low as 31 fps this
placed it on par with the GTX 970 which
is a solid result despite trailing the
newer mid-range GPUs since the ultra
quality presets seem to be a bit much I
have downgraded to the higher quality
preset and this made a huge amount of
difference in game frame rates now
remained above 70 fps and where for the
most part seen hovering between 80 and
90 fps so another impressive result for
the r9 290
maxed out the UH nine to ninety was very
competitive in titanfall two with an
average of 83 FPS which placed it on par
with the EVGA GTX 1060 for the wind plus
model along with the rx 470 the 290
never dipped below 60 FPS so performance
was very smooth as you're about to see
the previous results were based on the
single-player portion of the game which
surprisingly seems to be more visually
demanding than this multiplayer map so
the most part frame rates did stay above
100 FPS though at times did briefly drop
down to 80 fps overall a very smooth and
satisfying gaming experience was hard
with the 290 in titanfall 2
wrapping up the testing here is six more
games I quickly looked at they include
warframe Ghost Recon wildlands The
Witcher 3 dawn of war free csgo and prey
reinforcements we need that
a channel
Teno you cannot survive without arming
yourself choose a weapon before we
continue
I'm not sure what Bohr has done to your
warframe
yes
creates element occitan any magic ones
are cheeky gear off today tomorrow
I'm lollygagging
two of you
I keep it safe
scout Marines employing blight grenade
when favorite Hey
an example to the rest repositioning
with me Scout buries chapter master to
battle barks dauntless I required a
tactical marine squad drop to my
position incendiary
Blake couch MOOC content eerie throwing
fire
tract of alien material as you might
have noticed when watching the gameplay
food for the gigabyte r9 290 it still
runs quite hot at around 80 to 84
degrees that said the card was very
quiet the entire time and couldn't be
heard over the case fans which are also
very quiet also that temperature means
that it's at least 11 degrees off the
throttle temperature so performance
isn't going to be compromised
the reason the r9 290 is a bit of a hot
item other than the price is down to the
power consumption
here we see total system consumption
what's 50 Watts higher when compared to
the GTX 970 in the same system the
system of course was our core i7 7700 a
week which again is overclocked to 4.9 G
goats
so overall consuming just 321 watts is
hardly extreme for what is otherwise a
high-end system that said you can save
100 watts by going with the GTX 1060 for
example overall the r9 290 offered game
is a serious bang for their buck four
years ago when it was first released and
we find today little has changed for
those wanting to build a new rising
system for as little as possible with
the r5 1400 they could look to the r9
290 as a possible pickup adding that GPU
infra red $150 us would be an awesome
pairing for the hundred and seventy
dollar CPU and you'll end up with a very
capable 1080p gamer comparing a
second-hand r9 290 to a current
generation GPU with a similar price tag
you'd be looking at something like the
GTX 1050 Ti and as you just saw the
performance on the four-year-old model
is considerably better that said though
you are paying for the performance in
the form of extra power consumption that
I feel for most gamers this won't really
be an issue anyway let me know what you
think of the r9 290 I can't wait to see
all those fine wine comments seriously
though the r9 290 has aged very well and
it's a great value
option in my opinion I'm no slave they
again suing guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
