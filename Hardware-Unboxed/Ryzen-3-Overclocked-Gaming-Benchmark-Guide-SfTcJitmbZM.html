2 of our rising 3 the ultimate gaming
benchmark guide overclocking edition
previously we looked at how the horizon
3 1300 X and 1200 compared to the risin
5 1400 Core i5 7400 and pentium g 4560
and all the process in that video were
tested at best stock out of the box
clock speeds as promised in that video
what overclock the unlocked arisin 3 and
5 CPUs and then retest them against the
locked Pentium and Core i5 CPUs so
that's exactly what we're here to do
please note though I have dropped to the
horizon 3 1300 since it hits the same 4
gigahertz frequency is the cheaper our 3
1200 and at that speed they both deliver
the same performance so there was no
point testing them both as you would see
just the same figures on the graph so
got rid of 1300 X I hope that clears
that up in my opinion if you plan to
overclock then the r3 1300 X is a bit of
a bad buy instead I recommend save
yourself to $20 and get the r3 1200 so
we have the r3 1200 both stock and 4
gigahertz along with the r5 1400 which
has also been tested at 4 gigahertz and
they will once again be compared to the
core i5 7400 and Pentium G 4560 also
once again I have tested using the
geforce gtx 1060 1070 and 1080 at the
1080 p resolution yes i know you will
want a version with the Radeon rx 580
Vega 56 and Vega 64 and yes I'll get one
done soon although I'm only testing a
single resolution the fact that we do
have three different performing GPS will
give you an idea of how things should
scale it also give those sensible folks
pairing a budget CPU with a budget GPU a
real idea of what to expect meanwhile by
including the GTX 1080
you can see what kind of performance a
faster processor might enable should you
have the CPU power to take advantage of
it right let's check out the results and
then we'll discuss a few things at the
end of the video through the benchmarks
first up we have battlefield 1 and here
we see when using the gtx 1060 we do run
into a severe GPU bottleneck that limits
the average frame rate to 80
PS and the minimum to around 71 fps
these figures were achieved by all five
CPU configurations increasing the
rendering power with the geforce gtx
1070 we see that through overclocking
horizon 3 1200 is now just 4% faster for
the average frame rate but 7% faster for
the minimum the overclocked are 3 1200
was also 15% fast and the g 45 60 when
comparing the minimum result and it was
also two percent slower than the core i5
7400 not bad given the cost saving here
now in the unlikely scenario that you do
run with a gtx 1080 we see at the
overclocked r 3 1200 boost the minimum
result again by 7% though this time the
average was increased by 15% even with
the mighty GD x 1080 dr 3 1200 is able
to match the i5 7400 once overclocked
meanwhile the r5 1400 streaks ahead and
looks quite impressive here alright so
moving right along next up we have f1
2016 quite surprisingly we find more
extreme margins when compared to those
previously seen in battlefield 1 having
said that the gtx 1060 results are much
the same and it's not until we upgrade
to the gtx 1070 that we start to see a
separation between the quad cores and
the dual core quite shockingly the
overclocked Rison 3 1200 at 4 gigahertz
is 35 percent faster than the pentium g
45 60 when comparing the minimum frame
rate and this rather large margin is
thanks to an increased 9% bump in
performance from the overclock this also
meant that the overclocked r 3 1200 was
able to with a similar performance the
more expensive Core i5 7400 then when
paired with the GT X 1080 the
overclocked r 3 1200 became 44% faster
than the pentium g 45 60 and even edged
ahead of the core i5 7400 by 7 percent
margin for the average frame rate
perhaps even more impressive is the fact
that the R 3 1200 match to the R 5 1400
so a very solid result for AMD's new
budget champ
shuffling right along we find the Far
Cry primal results and as a mostly GPU
bound game it's not too surprising to
find that all CPU configurations deliver
the same numbers with the geforce gtx
1060 once again moving up the food chain
we found the gtx 1070 and here you
things start to get a little bit
interesting
overclock to the Rison three 1200 is now
able to deliver six percent more frames
on average and 11 percent we're looking
at the one percent lows more importantly
the overclocked are three 1200 once
again matches the core i5 7400 once we
step up to the GeForce GTX today the
Rison 3 1200 pulls comfortably ahead of
the core i5 7400 once overclocked and
there's also 18 percent faster than the
G 4560 not a bad result for AMD in a
mostly GPU bound title now for some
DirectX 12 action we have total war
Warhammer and for the first time we see
some variance between the results when
using the gtx 1060 the main thing to
note here is that it is the pentium g 45
6 that falls late in this very CPU
intensive title overclocked the r3 1200
makes up the small amount of ground at
trailed from the r5 1400 and i5 7400
once we upgrade to the gtx 1070 we find
that even overclocked to the r3 1200
does trail the core i5 7400 albeit the
margin is quite small overclocking does
boost the average framerate of the
rising three CPU by an impressive 11%
finally with the GT x 1080 installed the
overclocked r3 1200 actually catches up
and we seen this quite a few times
already in the other titles tested it's
now able to deliver Core i5 7400 light
performance while crushing the cheaper
Pentium G 4560 overwatch is another CPU
intensive title and here all 5
configurations were able to max out the
GTX 1060 with an average of around 147
FPS for this title I do use our 12
player bot match so these are some very
impressive numbers particularly from the
lowly g45 60 now with the gtx 1070
installed the overclocked r3 1200 goes
from 147 FPS to 187 fps that's a decent
27% boost that said it pales in
comparison to the r5 1400 which saw a
very healthy 37% boost
still we are three 1200 did match the
more expensive Core i5 7400 so an
impressive result here for the plucky
little rise and three CPU now with the
GT X 1080 installed we find that once
again the over the punch r3 1200 is able
to outperform the core i5 7400 it's well
worth noting the risin 3 CPU was able to
maintain over
180 FPS at all times in this very CPU
intensive game The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt
leans heavily on both the CPU and GPU
though using the ultra quality settings
like I have it's generally more GPU
dependent even at 1080p as you can see
with the gtx 1060 installed there isn't
really much to talk about all 5
configurations maxed out this mid-range
GPU the same is also true for the gtx
1070 though here we do see the pentium g
4560 falling behind a bit for the 1% low
results even with the gtx canadian sold
we don't have too much to talk about
that said here the overclocked r3 1200
is able to hunt down the core i5 7400
and once again match its performance
next up we have Rainbow six siege and
here the rising 3 CPU did offer slightly
better numbers with the gtx 1060 when
compared to the pentium g 4560 and even
the core i5 7400 jumping to the gtx 1070
we see competitive performance across
the board though it has to be said the g
4560 it does still hang in there quite
well however with the GTX 10 a taking
care of the rendering work at the
overclocked Arthur 1200 makes up
significant ground as it was 19% faster
once overclocked the minimum frame rate
was also 9% greater than that of the
core i5 7400 so a super result here for
AMD's budget rise and 3 series another
popular title we're looking at is World
of Tanks and previously the horizon 3
1200 did fall quite far behind the core
i5 7400 when testing with this game of
course the horizon 3 CPU is much cheaper
but still I felt once overclocked it
could probably make up the difference
and while we're certainly seeing that
here even with the gtx 1060 is the r3
1200 has now caught up and matches the
other cpus tested increasing the
rendering power with the gtx 1070 the r3
1200 gains a massive 24% more
performance as now 7% fast in the core
i5 7400 when comparing the minimum frame
rate
interestingly it also matched the r5
1400 both were of course clocked at 4
gigahertz but as you guys probably know
the r5 1400 does have SMT for a total of
8 threads increasing the rendering power
once again with the GTX 280 we find that
in this title we are indeed heavily CPU
limited and as a result no real extra
performance was had finally we have the
very popular
Counter Strike global Offensive and in
part one of this series I hinted at the
fact that the overclock rise and three
CPU did match the core i5 7400 in this
title and here you can see evidence of
this whereas the stock r3 1200 was only
able to match the Pentium G 4560 once
overclocked it was I want to match an
even slightly edgy at the core i5 7400
so another super result here for AMD's
affordable $110 u.s. quad-core CPU ok so
you've had a good look at the data from
the nine games tested time for a quick
cost per frame comparison first up let's
look at an average of the average frame
rates across the nine games tested and
discuss the cost per frame please note
the prices I'm basing this comparison on
are next to the process and model names
you will notice that I'm pricing the G
4560 at $90 us rather than the $64 MSRP
and this is because for now it looks
like this is the new price for the CPU
I'll discuss that a bit more later on
anyway let's discuss what's going on
here using a graphics card like the
geforce gtx 1060 the pentium g 45 60
even at the higher retail price still
represents the best value costing an
average of 81 cents per frame whereas
the overclocked are through 1200 costs a
little bit more at ninety cents per
frame still it's significantly more cost
effective than the r5 1400 and the core
i5 7400 both costing well over $1 per
frame with the gtx 1070 we fight the
overclocked r3 1200 and g40 560 are
quite similar in terms of value horizon
3 cpu now costs just 5% more that's not
bad given you do get a good boost in
overall performance
meanwhile the r3 1200 is 42% cheaper
than the core i5 7400 in terms of cost
per frame and that lines up well with
the overall price as it is 42% cheaper
now with the GT X 1080 installed the
overclocked r3 1200 is just able to edge
out the G 45 60 and is 44 percent more
cost-effective than the core i5 7400 so
a super result for the overclocked
horizon 3 CPU the average frame rates
are one thing that the CPU has a better
chance of making a real difference when
it comes to the 1% low performance that
said though the average minimum results
across the nine games tested much the
same and we
the G 45 16 / 5 2 r 3 1200 delivering
similar value once again out of our
interest I thought we should probably
look at the cost per frame for a single
tile one where the CPU is quite
important so I grabbed the overwatch
minimum frame rate results as you might
expect given what we've seen so far the
GeForce GTX 1060 and Pentium G 45 60
combo do provide the best value here
however once we step up to the more
powerful GTX 970 the G 45 60 is now on
par with the Rison 3 CPU then once we
call the gtx 10a the overclocked r 3
1200 delivers the best value overall as
it delivered 12 percent more bang for
your buck when compared to the g 45 60
and 45 percent more value when compared
to the core i5 7400 there are a few ways
you can look at the overclocked horizon
3 performance initial impressions might
seem underwhelming especially when
looking at certain tiles I don't know
myself despite being a big fan of
Verizon 3 I have to admit at first
glance the results for popular titles
such as overwatch battlefield 1 and
Counter Strike global Offensive they did
seem a bit disappointing at least as I
said that was my initial reaction once I
sat back though and thought about the
results for a minute I quickly realized
they weren't really disappointing at all
yes you do have to overclock the Rison 3
to 4 gigahertz assuming that you can but
even so the numbers at 3.9 gigahertz for
example would be much the same anyway I
think we can agree you'd have to
overclock your eyes and tree quite
heavily just to match the core i5 7400
and that does seem like a lot of messing
around just to match a stock Intel CPU
however it was then that I realized well
isn't that what overclocking is really
all about for an enthusiast on a budget
personally this is what got me
interested in computers to begin with
all those years ago when I built my very
first system using the Celeron 300 a
Fermi overclocking just isn't about
world records
yes mega / clocks are impressive and all
that but that's not really what excites
most of us now is it rather what gets me
and probably most of you enthusiastic
about overclocking is taking an ordinary
affordable CPU and turning it to
something more just like what I did
almost two decades ago with my beloved
seller on 300 a for the first time in a
long time now we have an affordable CPU
that can be overclocked and is worth
buying
kind of like the pentium G 32:58 but
unlike the dual-core it'll be good to
gain beyond next week circling back my
point is that the risin 312 and Rho cost
just a hundred and ten dollars u.s. and
can hit at least three point eight you
guys using the stock cooler and a cheap
be 350 motherboard 3.9 gigahertz really
should be achievable and if you're lucky
4 gigahertz won't be a problem either
and this was certainly the case with my
chip Brian over at Takeo City also
recently got his r3 1202 4 gigahertz in
a video he did so if you haven't checked
that out it is worth checking out and he
found under loaded hit just 76 degrees
so others are certainly finding similar
results as well meanwhile the locked
core i5 7400 CPU while less messing
around or suppose depending on your
point of view can be seen as less fun it
does cost $190 u.s. so if you're willing
to embrace the overclock then you can
achieve a similar level of performance
while saving just over 40% on the CPU
purchase alone I personally would much
rather saver the money you do the
tinkering in the bias and enjoy the
sensor pride you get when you know
you've done the research save the money
and managed to achieve the same
experience although I was only around 15
years old at the time I still remember
that feeling when I got my seller on 308
of 400 50 megahertz using an eye open
motherboard memories finally in my
opinion what these results tell me is
that although you're paying more for the
horizon 3 1200 over the Pentium 3 45 60
in the long run it will end up being a
better value purchase and we see this
one looking at the GTX 280 results where
the overclocked r3 1200 often pulled
miles ahead of the G 45 60 and offered a
much better cost per frame ratio still
as good as the r3 1200 is and it is
mighty good especially if you plan to
overclock the Pentium G 45 60 for $90
u.s. right now it's still a very good
buy but particularly if you're using
something like a geforce gtx 260 or a
Radeon rx 580 or of course anything
slower and if you can somehow get the G
45 60 for the $64 u.s. MSRP then I
highly suggest doing so especially if
you're on a tight budget because that is
just still an amazing deal anyway that's
going to do it for this one if you like
the video then you know what to do and
the good news is part three of the
series will be
coming next week as I include the
overclocked core i5 2500 K and AMD FX
8350 s I'm your host Steve see again
soon guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
