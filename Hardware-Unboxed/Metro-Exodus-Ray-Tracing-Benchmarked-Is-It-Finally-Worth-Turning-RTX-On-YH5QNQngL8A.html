time for us to once again talk about
ray-tracing everyone's favorite
technology to talk about this time in
Metro Exodus which is the latest game to
integrate support for invidious r-tx
technology last time we checked out
ray-tracing
in battlefield 5 and we were bit
disappointed with implementation news
ray-tracing reflections didn't add a
whole lot visually there were issues
with noise and the performance it was
pretty severe considering the game is
reasonably fast patience competitive
shooter all that sort of thing rate
racing in that game it just really isn't
worth it but things are pretty different
when it comes to Metro Exodus this isn't
a competitive online shooter instead
it's a slower paced open-world single
player survival shooter rate racing is
implemented as global illumination not
reflections and the game is launching
with optimized rate racing and do SS
from day one in this video we'll be
looking at both the quality differences
between RT X on and off for this title
as well as the performance hit across
all four NVIDIA GeForce RT X and
graphics cards at a range of resolutions
I'll spend a brief bit of time talking
about how do SS can be added to the
mixer you'll get a usual comprehensive
coverage of RT X in this game today so
what is global illumination to answer
that I'll start by talking about how
lighting works without global
illumination as is the case in well
pretty much a lot of games without GI
you're left with just direct
illumination so if there's a light
source anything that falls in the path
of that sources lighting will be
illuminated and will cast shadows but
this sort of lighting is limited and it
lacks realism and depth the reason why
it lacks realism is because this sort of
lighting does not include indirect
illumination in real life light doesn't
just emit from surfaces hit something
and then just disappear instead light
reflects off surfaces onto other
surfaces this is what global
illumination provides with this lighting
system enabled light bounces off
surfaces creating greater depth and if
light interacts with cold surfaces along
the way this can lead to coloured
reflections caustic effects are also
possible
so overall the lighting system becomes
better and more realistic global
illumination is also not new to ray
tracing is something that has been
possible previously with other
techniques however ray tracing allows
the effect to be more accurate more
realistic and more comprehensive across
a given scene in Metro Exodus ray traced
global illumination is available in two
modes there's a high mode and an ultra
mode
there's no low mode here is straight too
high for the base implementation and
then ultra I believe it adds further
reflection steps to the computer to
global elimination paths we're not sure
on that one and you do also need direct
x12 to be enabled to gain access to ray
tracing this isn't a big deal because in
our initial testing there's been no
performance difference between D X 11
and D X 12 and you can also enable and
disable ray tracing at any time without
restarting the games that's nice to see
in terms of the visual difference
ray-traced global illumination can be
subtle it can be obvious it all depends
on the scene and what you're looking for
however in general the improvements ray
tracing makes to Metro X's are far
greater than the improvements decks are
reflections brought to Battlefield 5 in
this scene you can immediately see the
differences between RT x on and RT X off
the scene has more depth and realism to
the lighting system it may not be
obvious at first but with global
illumination disabled some areas of the
scene are illuminated where really they
shouldn't be for example with our TX off
the boxes under the desk are illuminated
by pretty much a non-existent light
source here with our TX on these areas
are correctly presented in shadow it's a
similar situation with the back of the
lamp on the desk and the ceiling light
realistically very little light should
be hitting these areas and with global
illumination enabled that's what you're
getting it's a similar situation in this
scene with our TX off it looks a bit
weird having the bright wall and the
dark pipes with the lighting present
here you might not have ever noticed an
issue until you turned on our TX where
the lighting is better interacting with
these two elements yes it is darker but
it's more realistic and then answer the
atmosphere the effect is more subtle in
this scene but again the areas that
shouldn't be illuminated and illuminate
have visible the changes are I guess it
depends on the lighting the objects in
at the angry viewing and so on this is
one of the scenes where you won't see as
drastic of a change but when you step
into the above ground areas
of the game particularly during the day
RT access some of the biggest changes
I've spotted here it has almost the
opposite effect of the darker
underground sections rather than
removing light from surfaces that
shouldn't have it global illumination
outdoors tends to add light to where it
should be this scene for example has
lots of points of reflection including
the snow and several walls behind the
camera so again it makes sense that it's
brighter with less shadowed areas and
better surface interactions another
interesting note to make about this
scene is the tone the r-tx
soft environment has a slight yellow
tone due to the color of the Sun but
with r-tx off is whiter thanks to the
light reflecting off white and gray
walls and snow this is one of the other
advantages to global illumination this
is another scene where there is a
significant difference between r-tx on
and off ITX off feels like it has a
general ambient light from a
non-existent source whereas the r-tx on
footage says it's light comes solely
from the windows and overhead lights
which creates a darker though more
natural-looking presentation look at the
soldiers on the right in particular with
our Tiff's on they are more illuminated
than the two central characters as
they're standing directly under a light
whereas the central characters are not
so when you turn RTX off the scene is
lit more evenly the central characters
are roughly as bright as the soldiers on
the right which really doesn't make
sense given the position of the light
sources most of the other scenes I
captured just continue to show off the
aspects I've already mentioned
throughout most of the game these are
fairly significant and visually obvious
changes to the lighting system from what
I've seen the lighting appears more
realistic and more in line with what
you'd expect when considering where
light sources are placed and so on to me
there is greater depth and a more
natural look but it's also no definitive
case of r-tx on being better with
reflections aside from the noise issues
it was clear that raytrace reflections
were superior to screen space
reflections from a visual standpoint
with ray-traced global illumination
while I feel the lighting is more
realistic and has more depth it is a bit
more of an artistic change some people
may like the RCX off presentation more
if they prefer brighter scenes in dark
areas and more shadowing and bright
outdoor lighting there are a few more
points I want to make on the visuals
before diving into performance I found
it very difficult to spot any changes
between the high and ultra mode
sometimes I thought there was a small
difference only to discover the
differences were more down to the games
dynamic slightly changing lighting
system rather than the jump from high to
ultra r-tx so without looking at
performance it's pretty safe to say that
high is the way to go here there is no
noise present anywhere with raytrace
global illumination at least that I
could see this was a big issue with
reflections but it's not visible in
Metro Exodus that's well it's quite
clearly a fantastic thing because in
some scenes the noise and battlefield
fires of raytrace reflection was
extremely noticeable and could look
worse than with ray-tracing disabled in
Metro it's pretty much a non-issue it's
also important to note that the game
doesn't feel like something is missing
from the lighting system when r-tx is
disabled it's not a situation where the
developers have removed an effect from
the non r-tx version of the game only to
bring it back through ray tracing the
game still looks phenomenal with r-tx
off it's just at least in my opinion
looks even better and more accurate with
RT x on then is the question could for a
games the developer of Metro Exodus have
achieved the same global elimination
effect with that race race this is it's
quite tricky to answer because there's
no switch to simply enable a non
ray-traced global illumination in this
game to make a nice comparison I haven't
looked extensively into its
implementation other games but my feel
is that Metro Exodus is r-tx based gob
elimination is more accurate and more
comprehensive it definitely looks pretty
good here it's probably the most
accurate lighting system I've seen also
global illumination through other
techniques already tends to be a fairly
computationally intensive effect turning
ray tracing on does come with a sizable
performance hit as we'll see in a moment
however this has tended to be the case
with other games that use global
illumination as well
the r-tx penalty it is most likely going
to be larger however it's also a better
implementation so I'm not as concerned
with this being a pointless
reengineering of global illumination as
I was with reflections if we remember we
saw a reflection is done really well
without ray tracing in a much lower
performance cost in hitman 2 examples of
global illumination done as well as
Metro Exodus with a much lower
performance cost well that's a lot of
rare-earth not not possible and there's
a chance that using ray tracing is
easier for developers than other
technique
which could mean better visuals from
fewer development resources so moving
into performance probably should go over
the test setup before I get into the
numbers I've tested all the r-tx GPUs
using my Intel Core oh nine ninety nine
hundred K test rig although the CPU it
really doesn't matter here because the
game is very cheap you demanding latest
drivers will be used so that's in videos
for 1891 the day one drivers for Metro
Exodus I also tested with both the
pre-release and day one versions of the
game and I found no difference in
performance there the performance data
is from Metro Exodus --is built-in
benchmark tool this really helps to
simplify the testing process and make it
highly repeatable but I want to put a
big warning sign somewhere here on the
screen because there's a very important
few things to note about metros
benchmark tool I've played a few hours
of the game as well and so far the
benchmark tool represents performance in
the most intensive areas of the game in
fact if anything the benchmark is more
intensive than the game itself
throughout most of the game you can
expect performance better than the
benchmark tool shows however in those
really intense areas the benchmark is I
guess a reasonable reflection of in-game
performance if anything I feel the
benchmark does a better job of showing
performance with r-tx on while under
representing r-tx off performance
somewhat I'll elaborate this a little
bit after the charts but the margins
between our techs on and off in the
benchmark are usually slightly smaller
than the margins you'll see in the game
itself however the tool also tests areas
in the game I haven't personally gotten
up to yet so I'm not sure whether there
are more intensive scenes to come I
simply have no time to you know play the
game to actually get to any more
sections all of the settings with her to
ultra in the benchmark the only setting
I changed was rate racing there is an
extreme preset above ultra but I felt
ultra was the better balanced several
settings are not encompassed in the main
preset I guess you'd have to say and
these are all enabled with motion blur
set to normal
tessellation on full and both physics
and hair works enabled yes both those
features are included here DLS s-works
disables so we'll start with the 1080p
dot here immediately from the r-tx off
data you can see the game is very
intensive in its worst case scenarios
Steve will go into more detail on this
in his full metric
this GPU benchmarking at coming days but
at least you get a little bit of a sneak
preview of some of the results here an
ITX 2070 is required for a 60 FPS
average in the benchmark at just 1080p
while the most intensive parts of the
tool see that performance dip to near 30
FPS so yeah it's a bit painful but again
throughout most of the game I've played
you'll see performance higher than this
a good example is the ITX 2080 TI which
averages 90 FPS here but for many
sections of the game this is up more
around 120 fps aside from some of the
most intense scenes the good news is
enabling ray-traced global illumination
doesn't tank performance to anywhere
near the degree of raytrace reflections
in battlefield 5 looking at the RT x
high results we only saw a 17% increase
in performance from disabling our techs
at 1080p for the r-tx 2080 TI this grows
slightly to 21% for both the RT x 2080
and RT x 2070 and 24% for the RT x 2060
and the margins are smaller again we're
looking at 1% lows so it's clear that in
the very most intensive areas of metrics
it's not ray tracing that is causing
that extra performance drop the ultra
setting is more intensive again there's
around a 10% gap between the two modes
so for the Arctic's 20 a DTI
turning ray tracing down from ultra to
off sees a 26 percent performance
improvement rather than 17% from height
off considering there's almost no visual
change between high and ultra I really
don't see why you would use the ultra
mode here with battlefield 5 the
performance you gain from turning DX are
reflections from just the low mode to
off hovered between 50 and 60 percent
for most GPUs at 1080p with metro Exodus
going from high to off it's more like 20
percent so it's clear the performance
impact here is nowhere near the level of
battlefield 5 however with the RT X 2060
hovering around 41 FPS on average with
ultra settings at 1080p and using the
high r-tx mode I feel that rate rating
still isn't well suited to invidious
lowest level card capable of raytrace
again it is a worst case scenario but
that level of performance is quite low
especially with the 1% lowest below 30
FPS at 1440p the margins do grow a bit
compared to 1080p here the ITX 20 ATT is
a 25% uplift switching from high to off
that margin is up around 28% for the
2070 and 2080 while between 60 sees a
36% performance gain the ITX 2060 does
not perform well at 1440p with
ray-tracing here so it's not something
I'd recommend even the ITX 2070 is a bit
borderline in the benchmark
meanwhile the are chunks of 2080 and
r-tx 20 atti are at acceptable levels of
performance moving to 4k and this is a
resolution that simply wasn't worth
using with ray-tracing battlefield 5
with Metro Exodus it's borderline the
ITEX 2080 I see is a 38 percent
uplifting performance at this resolution
with r-tx disabled so much higher than
1440p and 1080p this shows once again
that rate racing doesn't scale nicely
with a resolution the performance impact
is higher with each resolution jump
especially when going all the way to 4k
the 2080 and 2070 get hit harder again
but both cards aren't great for 4k
gaming in this title to begin with
especially the 2070 meanwhile the art
x20 atti is really the only GPU I'd
consider using for high rate racing in
this game at 4k and even then I'd feel
the performance impact is probably too
large for most gamers going from a 47
FPS average which isn't amazing but
playable for this sort of game to a
mid-30s framerate is not great with that
said you will get better frame rates
with r-tx on at 1440p then you will with
r-tx off at 4k so again unlike with
battlefield 5 there's not the same level
of trade off between resolution and rate
racing as I mentioned earlier the
benchmark is a bit of a worst case
scenario for performance in general but
it's also typically a best-case scenario
for the margin between our techs on an
RT X off it's a bit weird in that regard
I find the opening few sequences of the
game twice with both our techs on and
our techs off and the margins between
the two playthroughs at 4k was sort of
35% on the low end but as high as 60% or
more in some areas it can vary a bit
between scenes and level so it's hard to
nail down an exact figure that's
representative of the game however the
benchmark delivered a 38% margin which
typically was on their better end of the
performance impact scale with that said
typical in-game margins looks more
reasonable at 1440p at 1080
with the benchmark showed a 17 to 25
percent gain from disabling ray-tracing
where is in the game itself up to a 30
percent gap is what you can expect in
the worst cases for ray-tracing
aside from playing at 4k you won't see
50 percent margins which was a key issue
with battlefield 5s ray-traced
reflections will deal SS improve upon
these performance numbers well yes and
no yes in the sense that enabling DSS
with RT X on takes performance back up
to around the level of RT X off in fact
RT X on with the high mode plus DSS was
around 8% faster at 4k than RT X off
although performance was 12 percent
lower than just running the game at
1440p with RT X on DSS at 1440p with RT
x on was actually a little slower than
RT x off though but it's also not an
improvement because the visual quality
is not equivalent the 4k DLS s
presentation is noticeably softer and
blurrier than native 4k I have more
thoughts on DL s s in a separate video
looking at battlefield fires
implementation as well but to me if I'm
playing in 4k I want the native sharp
image which is especially nice in Metro
Exodus and you simply won't get that
with DL SS enabled all right so that's
another ray tracing investigation
complete you might have noticed there's
a bit of a different tone to this video
compared to the last one in battlefield
5 there this really hasn't been another
video where I guess we take a dump on RT
X from a great height it's actually
genuinely quite different in Metro
Exodus so I wanted to come at this one
with a fresh perspective the big
question here is should you turn on RT X
and the answer is well it depends it's
not a universal recommendation but that
is an improvement from where things were
out with RT X in battlefield 5 with DXi
reflections I really could not recommend
anyone use the feature and it really
didn't do a good job of selling the
benefits of ray tracing
but with Metro Exodus there are some
cases where actually makes sense to turn
RT X on one of the key differences is
the game itself Metro is a slower
single-player game yeah you'll still
want good performance but part of the
games experience is in the breathtaking
visuals there's not as much to gain from
playing Metro Exodus at above 100 FPS
compared to a competitive multiplayer
shooter like battlefield then there are
2d
small factors that make this
implementation better than battlefield 5
firstly the visual changes larger may
not be subjectively better for every
person your opinion on how it looks may
vary even depending on the scene but I
found the differences were more
noticeable throughout the game on the
whole with reflections it was only some
areas where you couldn't spot the
effects of ray tracing and in some
instances it was horribly noisy but with
ray traced global illumination almost
every environment in the game is lit
differently and in my opinion more
accurately to me art exon looked better
most of the time sometimes substantially
so and then there's the performance it's
not as bad as DXi reflections either the
hit is still there especially at 4k but
it doesn't feel like we're in crazy
territory anymore a 20 to 30 percent
improvement from disabling the effect is
still one of the larger hits for any
individual graphics effect but it's not
fifty to sixty percent clear it was with
reflections it's also in line with some
of the larger performance hits we've
seen from non r-tx effects in games over
the last few years so again nothing
crazy when you combine all of these
factors RTX global illumination in Metro
Exodus is looking a lot more favorable
it's a game that benefits from stunning
visuals r-tx on looks better most of the
time and the performance hit is
manageable this is really how our techs
should have launched to the public if
this is what gamers got the first time
they saw ray-tracing in person I think
people's impressions would have been a
lot more positive but again it does
depend on your situation as to whether
r-tx is a feature worth enabling in the
game at 4k the higher than usual
performance it makes RT X not worth even
with an RT X xx atti you're only going
to get a 60 FPS experience with RT X off
at 4k within videos flagship GPU cutting
into that performance significantly is
really not a choice I'd make
I'd also tend to earn the side of not
using RT X for any configuration where
you're not already hitting a 60 fps or
there abouts especially if you don't
have an adaptive sync motor so this
would include the RT X tween 60 at 1080p
or the RT x 2070 at 1440p I feel the
experience with our techs off at 60fps
is better than our techs on it maybe 45
to 50 FPS or so in both instances but if
there's Headroom to spare and you're a
gamer that loves improved visuals then
yeah there is something to be gained
from playing with RT X enabled what
would be the r-tx 2080 at 1440p from
what I've experienced that card runs
metro comfortably above 60fps at that
resolution aside from the most intensive
situations you turn on ray tracing and
the game is still 60 FPS experience with
improved visuals if you love graphics I
don't see how that's a bad theme when
you're still achieving strong
performance in this title I do hope
though that one day we're in a situation
where using ITX can be a recommendation
in all situations but from a
first-generation product with the second
game to include the feature it really is
a lot more promising than I originally
thought it still shouldn't be used as a
factor in buying a new graphics card
because there are still so Hugh came
even announced to support the tech but
those that get a good deal on an RT X
GPU can enjoy this as a little bonus and
that's it for my thoughts on Metro X's
ray tracing I think the game comes out
today for the general public
it looks seriously good so this is one
of those tiles I think that PC gamers
will be loving aside from the whole epic
game store thing which yeah it's a bit
disappointing that happened around the
launch of this game but yeah the game
itself seems to be really good we'll
have a few follow-up pieces in the next
few days that are definitely worth
subscribing fault will have a full GPU
benchmark from Steve there's also an
optimization guide in the works and a
further look into DL SS along with DSS
and battlefield 5 which also launched
recently so stay tuned as we work on
those consider supporting us on patreon
it takes a long time and many extra
hours to produce these sorts of videos
in a timely manner so we really
