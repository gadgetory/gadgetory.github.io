we're answering one of the most
frequently asked questions we see about
PC gaming how many frames per second do
you need should you be running at the
same frame rate as your Manos maximum
refresh rate say 60 FPS on a 60 Hertz
monitor or is there a benefit to running
games at a much higher frame rate than
your monitor can display like say 500
FPS to answer this question we have to
talk a bit about how GPU and display
work together to send frames into your
eyeballs and how technologies like vsync
function but the bottom line is running
games and extremely high frame rates
well above your monitors refresh rate
will lead to a more responsive game
experience with lower perceived input
latency
that's instead of the question for those
that don't want to wait until the end
now let's talk about why this is the
case so let's assume that we have a
monitor with a fixed refresh rate of 60
Hertz in other words the monitor is
updating its display every one sixtieth
of a second or every sixteen point seven
milliseconds when running a game there
is no guarantee that the GPU is able to
render every frame in exactly sixteen
point seven milliseconds of time
sometimes it might take twenty
milliseconds sometimes it might take
fifteen milliseconds sometimes it might
take eight milliseconds that's the very
nature of rendering a game on a GPU with
this varying render rate there is a
choice of how each rendered frame is
passed to the monitor it can pass the
new frame to the display as soon as it
is completely rendered commonly known as
running the game with vsync or vertical
sync off or it can wait until the
display is ready to refresh before
sending the new frame that's a technique
known as vsync on using the first method
vsync off causes tearing this is because
a display cannot update its entire in
Ã¤j-- instantaneously instead it updates
line by a line usually from the top of
the display to the bottom and during
this process a new frame may become
ready from the GPU and as we're not
using vsync the frame is sent to the
display immediately the result is that
midway through a refresh the monitor is
receiving new data and updates the
remainder of the lines on the display
with this new data you're then left with
an image
the top half of the screen is from the
previous frame and the bottom half is
from the new freshly available frame
depending on their content being
displayed this split between new and old
frames in the 1 refresh presents itself
as a tear or visible line between the
old and new frames usually it's most
noticeable in fast-moving scenes where
there is a large difference between one
frame and the next while leasing off it
does lead to tearing it has the
advantage of sending a frame to the
display as soon as it is finished being
rendered for low latency between the GPU
and the display so keep that in mind for
later the alternate way to display an
image is with vsync on here instead of
the GPU sending its new frame to the
display immediately it shuffles each
rendered frame into a buffer the first
buffer is used to store the frame being
worked on currently and the second
buffer is used to store the frame the
display is currently showing at no point
during the refresh is the second buffer
updated so the display only shows data
from one fully rendered frame and as a
result you don't get tearing from an
update midway through the refresh the
only point at which the second buffer is
updated is between the refreshes to
ensure that happens the GPU Waits after
it completes rendering a frame until the
display is about to refresh it then
shuffles the buffers begins rendering a
new frame and the process repeats there
are two problems with vsync firstly if
your GPU rendering is too slow to keep
up with the display to refresh rate say
it's only capable of rendering at 40 fps
for a 60 Hertz display then the GPU
won't render a full frame in time to
meet the start of the displays refresh
so a frame is repeated and this causes
stuttering as some frames are displayed
only once while others are displayed
twice the second problem occurs when
your GPU is very fast and is easily able
to render a frame within the refresh
rate interval let's say it can render at
200 FPS producing a new frame every 5
milliseconds except you are using a 60
Hertz display with a 16 point seven
millisecond refresh window with vsync on
your GPU will complete the next frame to
be displayed in 5 milliseconds then it
will wait for 11.7 milliseconds before
sending the frame to the second buffer
to be displayed on the monitor and
starting on the next
this is why we vsync on the highest
frame rate you'll get matches the
refresh rate of the monitor as the GPU
is essentially locked into rendering no
faster than the refresh rate now it's at
this point that there's often a lot of
confusion I hear things like locking the
GPU to my monitors refresh using vsync
is great because if it renders faster
than the refresh rate those frames are
wasted because the monitor can't show
them and all they get is tearing and a
lot of other people point to power
savings from using V sync your GPU
doesn't need to work as hard there's no
benefit to running at frame rates higher
than the monitors refresh rate so you
can run at a loc'd fps and save some
power I can see why people would come to
this conclusion and there's some bits of
truth there but it's not accurate in
general and the reason for this is that
you're not factoring in the time at
which inputs are processed and how long
it takes for those inputs to materialize
on the display to explain why this is
the case let's go back and look at the
vsync on diagram but overlay the diagram
with the input from your mouse and
keyboard which is typically gathered
every one millisecond let's also use the
same example where we have a GPU capable
of rendering at 200 FPS with the 60
Hertz display with a vsync and a simple
buffer system in this simplified
explanation the GPU begins rendering a
frame corresponding to your mouse input
as soon as it receives that input at
time zero it then takes five
milliseconds to render the frame and
awaits a further eleven point seven
milliseconds before sending it to the
display buffer the display then take
some time to receive the frame to be
rendered and physically update the
display line-by-line with this
information even in the best-case
scenario we're looking at a delay of at
least sixteen point seven milliseconds
between your input to the game and when
the display can actually begin showing
you the results of that input to you
when factoring in display input lag CPU
processing time and so forth the latency
between input and display refresh could
be easily more than 50 milliseconds now
let's look at the fee sink off diagram
the GPU continuously renders regardless
of when the display is refreshing taking
five milliseconds to turn your input
into a complete frame the display can
then begin displaying that new frame
immediately albeit it might be only part
of that frame the result is the latency
between your input to the game and when
the display can
begins showing you the results of that
input reduces from sixteen point seven
milliseconds to around just five
milliseconds and there won't be any
additional buffers in real-world
implementations it's as fast as that
plus your monitors input lag and that's
where you get the advantage in this
example running at 200 FPS with vsync
off on a sixty Hertz monitor reduces
input latency to five milliseconds where
with vsync on that latency is at least
sixteen point seven milliseconds if not
more even though the display is not able
to show all 200 frames per second in its
entirety what the display does show
every one sixtieth of a second is
produced from an input much closer in
time to that frame this phenomenon of
course also applies with high refresh
monitors at 144 Hertz for example you
will be able to see many more frames
each second so you'll get a smoother and
more responsive experience overall but
running at 200 FPS with vsync off rather
than 144 FPS with vsync on will still
give you a difference between 5
milliseconds and upwards of 7
milliseconds of input latency now when
we're talking about millisecond
differences you're probably wondering if
you can actually notice this difference
in games depending on the game you're
playing the difference can be anything
from very noticeable to no difference
whatsoever a fast-paced game like csgo
running at 400 fps on a 60 Hertz monitor
will produce input latency at best
around 2.5 milliseconds and that will
feel significantly more responsive to
your mouse movements than if you are
running the same game at 60fps with 16.7
milliseconds of latency or more in both
cases the displays only shown you a new
frame 60 times a second so it won't feel
as smooth as on a 144 or 240 Hertz
display but the difference in input
latency is enormous running at 400 FPS
allows you to get your inputs to the
display nearly seven times faster if not
more compared to running at just 60 fps
it's hard to convey the difference on
camera but if you try it out for
yourself you're bound to feel the
difference in responsiveness and I
haven't just pulled this explanation out
of nowhere in fact NVIDIA knows the
limitations of vsync in terms of input
latency which is why they provide an
alternative called fasiq this display
synchronization technique is like a
combination of vsync on and facing off
producing the best of both worlds
fast sync works by introducing
additional buffer into the vsync on
pipeline called the last rendered buffer
this allows the GPU to continue
rendering new frames into the back
buffer transitioning into the last
rendered buffer when complete then on a
display refresh the last rendered buffer
is pushed to the front buffer that the
display accesses the advantage this
creates is the GPU no longer waits after
completing a frame for the display
refresh to occur like is the case with
vsync on instead the GPU keeps rendering
frames so that when the display goes to
access a frame at the beginning of the
Refresh period that frame has been
rendered more closely to the refresh
window this reduces input latency
however unlike with vsync off fast sync
delivers a completed frame to the
display at the beginning of each refresh
rather than simply pushing the frame to
the display immediately and it's this
technique that eliminates tearing fast
sync is only functional when their frame
rate is higher than the displays refresh
rate but it does succeed in providing
more responsive game experience without
tearing and of course Andy has an
equivalent called enhance sync so all of
this has hopefully explain why running a
game above your monitors maximum refresh
rate does deliver a more responsive game
experience and while the ability to run
games at higher frame rates is always an
advantage even if it might appear that
your monitor can't take advantage of it
the final thing I want to say is this in
this video I haven't talked about
adaptive sync technologies like g-sync
or free sync and that's because I've
been mostly talking about running games
above the maximum refresh where adaptive
sync does not apply there's a lot of
different syncing methods out there but
adaptive sync is very different to vsync
and fast sync that we've been talking
about and at least for this discussion
it isn't really relevant that's it for
this one hopefully I won't need to
answer any further questions about this
in a Q&amp;amp;A videos because we've been
getting questions on this for months if
