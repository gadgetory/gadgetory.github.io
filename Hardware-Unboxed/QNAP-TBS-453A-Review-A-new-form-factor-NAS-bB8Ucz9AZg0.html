today I'm checking out an extremely cool
NASA product two naps TBS for 5:30 a now
I felt the need to specify it was indeed
an ass because on first impression the
unit's pretty unrecognizable as a
network attached storage device juniper
given this new form factor in the
moniker Nass book and like a notebook
computer it can be tucked under your arm
and carried around with these the idea
behind this is that you can quickly
unplug the four five three a put it in
your laptop bag and take it to events
such as meetings and presentations to
display stored files and high-definition
multimedia content adding to its
usefulness for these sorts of scenarios
the device is extremely quiet mostly
thanks to the fact that it utilizes m2
SSD storage now I know what you're
thinking m2 storage isn't cheap but
these days you can pick up a terabyte of
m2 is storage for a little over 250 US
so it's becoming more affordable having
said that it definitely would come at a
pretty big cost to equip this thing with
a serious amount of storage but I don't
think that's what this NASA POC is
designed for rather the TBS 4 v 3a is
designed to be in all occasions portable
storage server land switch home theater
PC replacement and much more through its
try and improving qts software which
I'll look at a little more closely later
now though let's check out the physical
design and features you can see here how
small the device is and trust me the
thing is light it's just 724 grams with
no storage inside and seriously how much
does an m2 SSD weigh close to nothing so
fully stocked with four m2 drives the
weight difference isn't even noticeable
it's small - coming in at just 230 mil
wide 165 mildy and it's just 25
millimeters thick mini will easily fit
in most laptop bags as I said now let's
check out the connectivity starting at
the back there's an impressive range of
options including two HDMI ports two USB
3 ports an audio out jack 2 mic jacks
for karaoke action for gigabit networks
switch ports and a final standalone
Ethernet port right by the DC input
which is interesting in its own right
this device can accept DC input anywhere
between 10 volts and 20 volts this
supplied adapter is 65 Watts 19 volts
b'keen app says the flexibility makes it
for industrial factory and other
environments that require different
voltages moving to the side there's a
cleverly placed USB 2 port that's
extremely handy for plugging in your
wireless mouse and keyboard receiver
beside a long cooling then lastly at the
front of the device there's a USB
OneTouch copy button at the far left
which allows you to quickly copy data
from a portable USB storage device
followed by 2 USB 3 ports and an SD card
reader there's three green LED
indicators in the middle and handily on
the far right we have volume controls
and lastly the power button now the TBS
4 5 3 8 isn't just limited to the m2
storage inside rather it can be expanded
upon greatly by connecting to not
separately purchased expansion
enclosures which connect by a USB 3.0 at
the moment there's an option for either
an 8 bay or 5 bay expansion that will
allow you large amounts of storage and
will perhaps be suited to staying at
home ready to be reconnected when you
take the NASA book out for an adventure
there are two network modes supported by
the device 2 firstly network switch mode
where it simply acts as a switch to
share internet and gnash resources and
then also a private network mode where
you can create secure environments for
functions such as recording CCTV footage
and the like at the heart of the device
this entails impressive 14 nanometer
cell Ron and 3150 SOC which is a quad
core that operates at 1.6 gigahertz with
a boot clock of 2.0 8 gigahertz equipped
with the Intel HD graphics engine
utilizing 12v use clocked at 320
megahertz with a 640 megahertz burst
rate the TDP for the CPU is an extremely
low 6 Watts in terms of memory there are
two options out of the box 4 gigabytes
or eight gigabytes and that's per usual
you'll pay a hefty price premium for the
larger memory option the difference is
actually a hundred and fifty US dollars
and this seems like a bit much but also
seems to be the way of the industry I'm
actually surprised not to see a 16
gigabyte option but I believe the
processor used can only support up to an
8 gigabyte maximum storage wires as
mentioned you can only crown m2 SSD is
inside and we've got space for four of
them these utilize the SATA interface so
bandwidth is limited to 6 gigabytes per
second rendering nvme drives redundant
but hey so do the gigabit network
connection anyway but this is still fast
enough for most use case scenarios
including streaming 4k video for example
QNAP software is some of if not
the best nasty vice software going
around so I expected installation to be
a walk in the park and it was with
internet available in the NASA connected
to your network you simply visit start
Coon opcom and follow the simple
on-screen prompts from there once
installed the qts software is both
beautiful and intuitive acting and
appearing quite similar to a standard
Windows OS environment there's the
familiar taskbar and desktop icons which
can be grouped and there are three modes
to switch between based and what device
are using to access the software tab for
tablets window and frameless the overall
look and feel of the qts software is
great and it really goes a long way to
making the entire device scene premium
there's seriously a ton of software
features and I won't go over all them in
detail we might literally be here for
days let's look at some of the key ones
there's a cool dashboard which gives you
important hardware statistics as well as
a resource monitor and all of these
Dashboard widgets can be dragged and
dropped onto the desktop the control
panel is powerful - here you can access
things like system settings privilege
settings network services and
application settings there's a storage
manager of course and this allows you to
identify format and check on drives as
well as pick the raid level that suits
your needs here you can also create I
scuzzy storage arrays and add targets of
other key nap nas devices to the NASA's
virtual disks QNAP snapshot feature is
also a brilliant backup system allowing
you to recover specific files in a
folder or an entire folder without
having a time-consuming you recover an
entire data set as well as other
powerful functions controlling Nass
basics such as external devices network
settings network services shared folders
and more is simple intuitive and
powerful in the qts software - but
perhaps the best part is Qun apps apps
enter here you can quickly search the
library install remove and update
existing apps and browse categorized
apps including to nap zone
recommendations think Google Play for
your Android there's a huge range of
apps and Coon app even goes to the
effort of certifying apps you know
you'll have no issues if there's a lot
of interest I can go further into the
software features included but most of
fairly self-explanatory including
download station video stations
surveillance station and more the last
software feature that's certainly worth
mentioning though is the Linux station
this allows you to quickly and easily
turn the nasa into a pc with a
pre-configured Ubuntu distribution and
the entire process is just about
idiot-proof
even I did it for
marking NASA products we use the Intel
NASA performance toolkit if you haven't
seen or heard of NASA PT before it's the
file system exercise or an analysis tool
designed to enable direct measurement of
home network attached storage this tool
emulates the behavior of an actual
application to provide real-world
workloads of typical data applications
used by home users for testing this Hebe
s45 3a has been configured using a
single transcend MTS 800 512 gigabyte
Drive unfortunately I don't have more
than one of these drive spare at the
moment so I couldn't test raid
nevertheless the performance of the TBS
4 v 3a is very strong and we can see
that in many of the tests it's able to
max out the gigabit network connection
with performance just north of a hundred
megabytes per second taking a look at
the application performance receive an
impressive performance in all four tests
and the photo album and office
productivity performance was very strong
now when looking at the file and
directory copying results we see the TBS
453 a again does very well especially
given us being compared to some pretty
stiff competition the download are from
NASA performances Intel labels that was
most impressive
the qnap TBS 453 a sure is different
it's a pioneer of sorts and its form
factor and function and ultimately a
very niche product as is often the case
with niche products the TBS 4 v 3 is a
little on the expensive side the compact
form factor comes in an obvious storage
capacity trade-off too but this can be
somewhat worked around with kynapse
expansion units but again these come at
a cost the device presents itself as the
ultimate solution for those seeking a
portable NASA with awesome multimedia
options that's strangely but also oddly
conveniently you can double as a network
switch as stated the qnap software is
best in its class this is always a
strong Pro in favor of any QNAP device
on the downside though the boot time is
curiously long and the $150 premium for
the privilege of a 4 gigabyte of RAM
upgrade is very steep and that's us
prices the 4 gigabyte version goes for
450 US dollars while the a gigabyte can
be had for a whopping 600 USD meanwhile
in Australia we get stung even harder
the 4 gigabyte model were brand new $700
and the a gigabyte model starts at 950
ouch don't forget to add shipping so all
in all this is a damn cool powerful fast
and feature-rich device just be prepared
to pay for it it'll be interesting to
see the markets response
this kind of device and to see where the
other companies come along with similar
solutions with this kind of NASA suit
