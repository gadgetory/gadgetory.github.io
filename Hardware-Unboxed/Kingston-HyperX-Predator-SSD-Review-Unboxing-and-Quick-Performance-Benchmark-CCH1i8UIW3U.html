hardware on box
I'm your host Matt and today we've got a
product that I'm very excited about
we've got on hand Kingston's fastest
ever SSD the HyperX predator now unlike
most SSDs on the market the HyperX
predator doesn't use the serial ata
interface instead it uses PCI Express
which provides a lot more bandwidth as a
result performance is measured in
megabytes for this one the HyperX
predator provides an awesome 1.4
gigabytes per second read coupled with
volume gigabyte per second write these
stats are all advertised in the box
we're going to few other technical
specifications luckily enough in my hand
right now I've got the 480 gigabyte
model as it stands this is the largest
available in the market right now
alright guys and their time for the
unboxing
alright so Kingston's included a nice
little shiny sticking through case we've
got a very tiny instruction manual it's
pretty much I'm Reba and you just got
the Kingston software activation key
peel away this very sexy HyperX firm and
we got the product itself almost systems
have a PCI Express slot how are they
doing all off a tend to support the
privet is actually an m2 SSD it's been
fitted to a PCI Express adapter card
Kingston will have most likely gone down
this route to improve compatibility on
the box the predator comes fitted with a
full hot bracket the conveniently
included is a hot by bracket alert
protocol systems to the predator is a
PCI a gen to Todd and this is the time
support connector which allows for a
pigpen is about 2 to 2 bytes per second
this is plenty of headroom because the
card is only rated for up to 1.4
gigabytes per second alright guys one
little thing we noticed about the HyperX
and maybe a little bit different to most
m2 cards that come with a PCIe adapter
is it looks like you can actually remove
the card from the adapter without where
the warranty sir stick it up say
warranty void if removed but as far as
you can tell it was absolutely no way
that you hadn't heard you've done it so
you can just unscrew it from the adapter
like so slide it into your motherboard
and screw it in and there's no way
Kingston could be any the wiser now you
know how we run box we never leave
behind drive without a performance tests
and seeing the card in the system so
we've moved the old dusty type necks out
of the way so you can see how it's
locked in so just straight into the PCIe
slot there all you have to do is screw
it in now let's go and give it a test
run
now benchmark by default we've got C
Drive selected but we want the second
routine drivers this is the predator
now let's it stop so first we have the
sequential ride test and here we see the
predator gets very close to the chord of
one gigabyte per second hitting 894
megabytes per second now sequential read
and the gambia close to the advertised
speed of 1.4 gigabytes per second with
1369 megabytes per second the random 4k
performance is very good and the right
result is certainly much stronger than
any SATA SSD we've seen including the
samsung SSD 850 Pro although this isn't
an nvme SSD the predator delivered
pretty exceptional threat of performance
and finally we have the access time
results everything looks great here as
well the read access time is a
blistering fast point zero 40
milliseconds before wrapping things up
we're going to take a quick look at the
copy benchmark - here we have a
compressed iso file test as well as a
program game of your test so let's start
the iso file test took less than a
second hitting disturbing gigabyte for
seconds the program tests which features
many more smaller red rice took a bit
longer they were still managed to
healthy 450 megabytes per second which
is again much faster than any start a
SSD we've seen
lastly the game copy benchmark took less
than two seconds and got just over 700
megabytes per second this has been
another unboxing and quick product
preview from Hardware unbox if you liked
it hit like you disliked it it dislike
but most importantly hit subscribe
