time for another update to our series
that explores current graphics card
prices we must provided you with a look
at the market in October and well we're
back today with a December overview of
how prices have changed what to expect
in the future and the current best value
cards in terms of value what you'll see
in this video isn't gonna differ greatly
from steve's top 5 best graphics cards
video he published a couple of weeks
back but it will provide a bit of extra
information and there has been a few
interesting trends to emerge in this
last month in terms of pricing so let's
start this exploration with a look at
invidious current GPU liner in this
table you can see the lowest available
prices for graphics cards across the
year from May July October and now
December Plus each cards MSRP all in US
dollars what you'll notice immediately
is that most cards have come down in
price since October when we get the data
just after the release of NVIDIA GeForce
r-tx 2017 the GTX 1050 Ti hasn't changed
all that much but both gtx 1060 s are a
good 10% cheaper while the gtx 1070
against a hefty 12% reduction meanwhile
the gtx 1070 TI which has been great
value for months now has only dropped in
price slightly which isn't a surprise
considering a lot of people have been
recommending them the big thing is to
know it from Nvidia is Pascal cards are
firstly that the gtx 1070 is now more
appropriately priced back in october
there was only a $10 or so difference
between the 1070 and 1070 TI which
didn't make it worth buying a 1070 today
that difference is more like $45 which
brings the 1070 back into discussions
but the bigger news is the exit of the
gtx 1080 and gtx 1080i from the market
in october both these cards were readily
available and competing very strongly
with the RT x 2070 and RT x 2080
respectively in both cases we
recommended the older pascal cards over
the new truing products as i simply
provide a better bang for buck today
both the 1080 and 1080 TI are basically
gone from the market there are a few
available at retailers like Newegg and
amazon but very inflated prices and the
cards will not be restocked when sold
out this isn't a huge surprise in video
we'll have been
wanting to get rid of 1080s and 1082
eyes in the market as quickly as
possible leaving their new r-tx cards
unchallenged by older products those who
were able to purchase either a 1080 or
1080i before they saw that got a
fantastic deal anyone wanting that sort
of performance today is essentially
stuck with the r-tx line that isn't
necessarily bad news though because both
the RT X 2070 and RT X 2080 are now
available at their MSRP of five hundred
and seven hundred dollars respectively
the art X 2080 coming down to seven
hundred dollars is relatively new
development the RT X 2070 has been at
five hundred dollars for a little while
now but the 2080 has been very slow to
reach its MSRP and at seven hundred
dollars the twenty eighty isn't offering
amazing value but it's at least now
matching where GT X 1080 eyes were
priced at the end of that Pascal cards
life however the RT x 2080 Ti is still
massively overpriced no card has ever
been seen at the $1,000 MSRP in fact
since October prices have actually gone
up with the cheapest cards now sitting
around $1,300 so $100 above the founders
edition price the reason for this
inflated price still seems to be related
to stock there just aren't enough 2080
guys being made so we'll be stuck with
high prices for a while to come it's
also worth remembering that there's a
reason why cars like the GTX 1070 and
gtx 1066 gigabyte are currently priced
below the MSRP that's because we are
expecting in video to launch their
successors in the 2060 and 2050 in
january the 2060 looks to be replacing
the 1070 and the 2050 replacing the 1060
so while you can get a good deal on
those Pascal cards now like with the
1080 and 1080 TI we don't expect the
1060 or 1070 to be around that much
longer but that does bring up the
question should you buy a card like the
GTX 970 now or wait until we see what
the 2060 is going to provide I'll leave
that one up to you guys but considering
you shouldn't have to work too much
longer it might be worth simply waiting
and seeing what NVIDIA has in store in a
month or so I think discounted Pascal
cards will still be available around the
launch of mid-range cheering cards as
well all right let's talk ambi GPUs now
and it's here that we have some great
value in the mid-range the RX v 7t and
rx5 a have been available below the MSRP
s for the last month or so now
both offers screaming good value the RX
570 at $150 is an absolute steal and has
come down and price by $10 since October
while the rx 588 gigabyte has received a
significant 20% price cut pushing it
under $200 for the first time either our
phenomenal value right now however it's
not as good news for the rest of AMD's
Linna Vega cards have actually increased
in price slightly up 4% since October I
suspect that's due to Vega cards
receiving nice discounts around the
launch of invidious r-tx line now that
those discounts are no longer in effect
both cards are back around or slightly
above the MSRP meanwhile the freshman
released rx 590 is still 280 dollars
which is nowhere near a good price for
that card at this stage we're not
expecting any new ambi GPUs in the near
future so I hope AMD can continue to
price the RX v 7t and rx 580
aggressively and keep stock at healthy
levels they're pretty much crushing
Nvidia in that 150 to 250 dollar
mid-range space right now though that
could change come the release of
invidious nuturing based mid-range
offerings the next big release from AMD
should be Navi GPUs manufactured using
TSM sees seven nanometer technology
we're hoping those GPUs provide
competitive options through the high-end
as well as a flagship GPU to compete
with the art x20 ATI but really we don't
have any idea what the lineup will look
like at this stage in any case if you
want to buy a GPU right now there's not
much point waiting to see what Navi will
bring because you might be waiting a
little while there right I've already
talked a bit about which products in
these lineups offer the best value but
let's now take a look at some cost per
frame charts across five recently
released titles using 1440p noxious
settings starting with the Assassin's
Creed Odyssey we see both the RX v 7t
and rx 580 providing elite value at the
top end of the charts beating out both
the GTX 1063 gigabyte and six gigabyte
variants the rx 570 is slightly better
value but either option is great for
1080p gaming meanwhile the RX 590 is
worst value than the ITX 2070 here 1440p
gaming it's the gtx 1070 beating out the
gtx 1070 TI and vega 56 at the moment
previously vega 56 was quite competitive
with these cards but that's not really
the case anymore the top-end in this
tile unfortunately in Vegas 64 isn't
great value up against the RT X 2070 or
ix 2084 horizon for is a much more
optimized higher than assassin's creed
in here we're seeing the arts 570 and
580 taken even stronger lead while the
RX 590 is OK value but still not worth
recommending over the 580 then for 1440p
class gaming Vega 56 is very competitive
but it's edged out in terms of bang for
buck by the gtx 1070 vega 56 is faster
but also $80 more expensive there that
said in this town Vega 56 is the way to
go compared to the 1070 TI Vega 64 is a
better buy than the RT X 2017 this title
both cards of the same price but Vega 64
is faster while the RT x 2080 and 2080 I
are unchallenged in terms of the
performance in battlefield 5 we're
looking again at the RX 570 in arts 580
destroying the rest of the field here
while invidious upper mid-range cards in
the gtx 1070 and 1070 TI form the best
options around that 300 to 400 dollar
mark then at the upper end it's a close
call but the RT x 2070 is just slightly
better value than Vega 64 though you
could go either way here hitman 2 is
again very favorable to the RX 517 RX 5
value they are much better value than
the gtx 1060 in this title
however Vega isn't as strong here the
gtx 1070 and 1070 to offer better value
than vega 56 while the RT x 2070 gets
out not over Vega 64 finally we have
just called for the least optimized
tariffs in this selection of games and
well it's really no different to what
I've been saying
Ami's players cards take the mid range
crown while NVIDIA is better value in
the upper price brackets again all this
data aligns perfectly with what Steve
showed in his top 5 best GPUs video he
recommended both the RX 570 and I ox 580
in that $150 to $250 range and the gtx
1070 TI at around $400 I also throw in
the gtx 1070 at $340 which is come down
in price since our top 5 video and
across a handful of today's games is now
slightly better value than the 1070 TI
about that price to your value starts to
drop away and you're left with
diminishing returns for every extra
dollar you spend
these days the RT x 2070 isn't a
terrible deal at $500 in most games it's
a better choice than the identically
priced Vega 60 for me
while both the r-tx 20/80 and especially
the r-tx 20 atti
are the least attractive cards in terms
of bang for buck but they're also
completely unchallenged in terms of
performance so if you want that level of
power you'll have to spend be whoever at
least it's nice to see the artex 2080
now sitting and it's MSRP some models I
guess that's it for this one as we've
been doing all year we'll continue to
monitor graphics card prices into 2019
and revisit this topic early next year
likely with a few new GPUs on the market
