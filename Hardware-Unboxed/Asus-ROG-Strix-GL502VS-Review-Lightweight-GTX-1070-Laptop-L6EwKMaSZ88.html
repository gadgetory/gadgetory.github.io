unbox today I've got a video for you on
a gaming laptop so you guys actually
might consider buying this time it is
the asus rog Strix GL 502 vs this is a
15.6 inch gaming laptop powered by the
nvidia geforce gtx 1070 so it comes on
the upper end of the performance and
price scale but is certainly very well
suited to 1080p gaming at above 60
frames per second before I dive into the
design I will just talk briefly about
the hardware in my review 'not here this
is an Intel Core i7 7700 HQ processor
with 16 gigabytes of ddr4 Ram there's
also a 256 gig SSD pad with a one
terabyte hard drive and of course
there's the gtx 1070 in there ports and
GPU power this is the only configuration
available to you in australia if you're
in the united states again there's just
one configuration but the 256 gig SSD is
swapped out for a 128 gig SSD instead as
this is a 15.6 inch laptop it's
reasonably portable as far as gtx 1070
gaming laptops are concerned it's 30
millimeters thick so that's around the
same thickness as comparatives from MSI
and gigabyte and even Alienware but it's
actually a quite a lot lighter at just
2.2 kilograms
where most other laptops of this class
are pushing up to v3 kilogram mark so
you definitely get a more portable
experience and you'll find from some of
the other options available and of
course it's not a 17 inch laptop so you
might be able to actually fit it into
your backpack but don't forget that if
you are taking around this laptop you
will have to carry the 200 plus what
power brick which clocks in at 650 grams
so that adds to the heft of this unit a
little bit but you'll find that on all
gaming laptops with such powerful
hardware inside a suit has used a
primarily plastic construction for the
GL 502 vs to keep its weight down but
this leads to a look and feel that is
just a little bit cheap especially
compared to its competitors that use a
lot more metal around the body there is
some metal to be found on this laptop
the lid is quite a nice brush black
design but a Sousa has tried to imitate
this with the plastic used around the
keyboard and it doesn't quite hit the
mark here at least in my opinion I quite
like the use of a black base color with
some vibrant orange highlights it is
pushing into the gamer style territory
especially when you factor in those odd
patterns that are sources used here in
some of the awkward angles but compared
to the silver model that is available
for the gel 502 vs I definitely prefer
this black and orange design it's
reasonably good as far as gaming laptops
are concerned what I wasn't as impressed
with is the keyboard which has a
surprisingly shallow travel distance in
a laptop that's 30 millimeters thick
all of other gaming laptops tend to push
the boundaries as far as travel distance
is concerned and that gives you a better
tactile experience while gaming but the
GL 502 vs has pretty much an ultrabook
keyboard I don't think that gives the
best experience in gaming it also has a
reasonably cramped arrow key so they've
shoved in between the right modifiers
and the numpad the inclusion of a numpad
is quite handy on a 15.6 inch laptop but
I wish they would have pushed some of
the travel distance up a little bit so
that it gave you a better feel in games
the trackpad it's not too bad it has a
decent tracking experience and a
reasonable click to it I don't expect
anyone will be using it for gaming but
it's nice to know that it works
effectively for the times that you are
not using this laptop with an external
mouse the i/o on the GL 502 vs is pretty
standard on the left hand side you'll
find mini DisplayPort HDMI Ethernet USB
3.0 and a USB 3.1 gen2 type-c port on
the right hand side there's an SD card
slot to further USB 3.0 ports and a
single 3.5 no audio jack I probably
would have liked to see Thunderbolt 3
here as well as an additional 3.5 an
audio jack but I think the range of USB
ports and display outputs will satisfy
most gamers here I'm pretty happy with
the display that a suit is opted for
here is a 15.6 inch TN LCD with a
resolution of 1920 by 1080 because it's
TN you can't expect fantastic color
performance or viewing angles and that's
certainly the case with this particular
laptop it doesn't quite hit the marks in
terms of our color performance tests but
the key feature here is it's 100
Hertz refresh rate and support for
g-sync the gtx 1070 in this laptop can
often push frame rates above the 60fps
mark so the back of this laptop can run
at 120 Hertz with some nice smooth
adaptive sync means you were getting a
really good gaming experience if it
comes at the expense of slightly weaker
color performance you still get 313 it's
of brightness and a contrast ratio of
around 1200 to one but again I wouldn't
be using this laptop for color accurate
work and now it's time for the section
that all you guys are interested in the
performance and we'll start off by
diving straight into our PC mark
workloads starting off with the home
sweet here as you can see here the ROG
GL v o 2 vs performs quite well with its
i7 7700 h2 and the sort of lead that
you'll see over some gtx 1060 laptops is
carried over into the creative workload
which is a bit more GPU bound some of
the other pc mark workloads we're going
to be work score and the rog GL 502 vs
disappointed a little bit here if it's
score of under 3000 taking a look at the
results in Cinebench and again you'll
see very similar performance from VI 770
782 in this laptop compared to some of
the other gang laptops we've reviewed
with the CPU inside this is a pretty
similar scenario that you'll see in our
x264 encoding benchmark again this
laptop obliterates some of the
ultrabooks you'll see thanks to its
extra cores and you know it's a
multi-threaded workload so you'd expect
to see very strong performance on the i7
7700 HQ moving on to win raf again you
see very similar performance from the i7
7700 HQ here compared to some of the
other gaming laptops we reviewed with
this cpu inside and a very similar
situation in matlab as well taking a
look at our simulation workloads which
are mostly single threaded
this laptop performs very well here
thanks to its high clock speeds on the
i7 7700 HQ before we dive right into our
gaming benchmarks and we'll take a look
at one 3dmark workload and we've chosen
time spy because it is the most
intensive workloads that you will find
it's score of over 5,000 is pretty
decent for a gtx 1070 and laptop it
comes in 50% faster than some of our
x10 60 laptops and just 18% slower than
our GT X 1080 laptop so this is pretty
much what you'll expect to see in the
most GPU bound games that you'll find
today such as rise of the Tomb Raider
which we'll talk about a little bit
later
moving on to games performance now and
one thing that you guys have been
requesting is 1% low results for laptops
and this is definitely something I've
been working on I don't have enough data
to put up comparisons just yet but I
will be stating the 1% lower results for
all of the games that you'll see here
today starting with Tomb Raider an older
tile which pushes 80 frames per second
on average making it 46 percent faster
than our GTX 1060 laptops and a 1% lower
result of 60 FPS makes it quite smooth
gaming performance overall
moving on to Metro last light is very
high benchmark and we're looking at over
100 FPS average here which is 31% faster
than our GTX 1060 laptops with a 1%
lower result of 50 FPS so a bit of a low
1% low result here that's pretty typical
for laptops that we've seen revealed to
BioShock Infinite and we're starting to
see a small CPU bottleneck here
126 FPS average at its maximum 1080p
quality settings 26% faster than the GTX
1060 and a 1% lower result of 56 fps
Middle Earth shadow of Mordor again it
tends to perform quite well on laptops
124 FPS average here 40.6% faster than
the GTX 1060 with a 1% load of 80 FPS so
a really strong performance here in this
game movie oh do Grand Theft Auto 5 and
another strong result for the gel 502 vs
with an average of 86 frames per second
making it 38 percent faster than our GTX
1060 laptops and a 1% low of 58 FPS is
very respectable here in Batman Arkham
Knight 78 FPS average meaning that it is
39% faster than our GTX 1060 laptops and
that 1% lower rate of 43 is pushing it a
little bit low in this title but it's
not too bad nonetheless concern
Jessica laptop rise of the Tomb Raider
the most intensive title in our
benchmark suite we're looking at a 48
FPS average in the dx12 mode which makes
it a huge 63 percent faster than our gtx
1060 laptops however the one percent low
FPS count of just 21 means that we're
not seeing too smooth performance ii and
you will want to bring that quality sand
down to about a high level which results
in 1% low 45 FPS in our testing if you
want to play this game or sort of the
more smooth the frame rates that you'd
expect from a pc gaming experience Deus
Ex mankind divided ultra settings
average frame rate hear of 57 fps making
it 43 percent faster than our GTX 1060
laptops and a very strong 1% low result
here at 47 fps so not too far away from
that average result and again it's
strong performance here from the gtx
1070 we don't have too much comparison
data for the following games but you can
enjoy some in-game footage here as we go
through some results in a hitman 94 FPS
average with a 1% low of 57 FPS and it's
1080p ultra settings in DirectX 12
senses a game that runs really well on
the GL 502 vs civilization 6 CPU limited
here so we can't expect too much from
your i 770 700 HQ but as 1080p maximum
quality settings in DirectX 12 we can
still see a 53 FPS average with the 1%
low of 38 fps goo results here in this
game and one of the most intensive
titles except for either the tomb raider
watchdogs 2 and it's 1080p ultra preset
and average FPS of 51 and a 1% low of 37
so if you have it edit ultra preset
you're still getting a good gaming
experience in watchdogs to opt for
quality settings and gsync helps out a
little bit to make that experience nice
and smooth one thing you may have
noticed across all of our benchmarks is
we do have another gtx 1070 laptop to
compare it to and in general the gel 502
vs was around 2 to 7 percent slower that
other Asus laptop
you see there has a more powerful CPU
and that can result in slightly higher
framerate on average but a strong
performance results from the gel 502 vs
nonetheless and just briefly let's take
a look at the SSD performance it was
disappointing to discover that it uses
just a micron 1100 SATA drive so not a
PCIe nvme SSD like we see in a number of
other gaming laptops and this leads to
limited sequential performance e
sequential read speeds of just 435
megabytes per second it's quite a lot
lower than some other gaming laptops
that we've seen and you'll see similar
performance results in our random
results again performance profiling a
little bit below what would expect from
other gaming laptops now as we've
covered the before let's just take a
look at how this laptop performs from a
cooling standpoint and we opened up the
GL 502 vs I was surprised to discover
how small the heat sinks are considering
there's a gtx 1070 inside it seems the
de Souza's opted for a fast fan design
that pushes air aggressively through
that small heatsink which is attached to
the GPU and CPU through some pretty
massive heat pipes surprisingly though
this laptop isn't too loud under load
it's certainly no louder than any other
gaming laptop I've used and the fan
noise profile is reasonably Pleasant
meaning that there's no high pitched jet
engine whine and if you're using say
external speakers or you know a good
pair of headphones you won't notice the
fan noise too much over your ingame
audio and that's a pretty decent result
from this gaming laptop as far as
thermals are concerned in the intensive
I 64 stability test with both the CPU
and GPU being Werner choosing Mac's the
CPU sits at around 90 degrees Celsius
and the GPU at 80 degrees Celsius with
only limited CPU throttling this
represents a very very intensive and
worst-case scenario for the GL 5 OG vs
and in actual games like watchdogs to
the CPUs it's more like 80 degrees
Celsius with the GPU as well and 80
degrees Celsius with no thermal
throttling in sight so despite the fact
that those heat sinks are quite small
the actual thermal performance of this
laptop in games is very decent and I
don't see any reason for complaints as
far as the design of the cooling
solution is concerned perhaps the most
attractive aspect of the GL 502 v8 is
its price at
1,700 US dollars this is the cheapest
current-generation gtx 1070 laptop you
can get and this is mostly due to the
use of a 128 gig SSD compared to 256
gigabytes in competitors from msi
gigabyte and so forth
with those laptops costing around 100 US
dollars more so if you want to really
tight budget and you can't simply spare
that extra 100 bucks the GL 502 vs is
the best option and for those of you in
Australia it costs around $3,000 redo so
again a pretty competitive price point
in my local region and this price point
you get a very decent gaming experience
I was a bit disappointed with the SSD
performance but the core i7 7700 HQ and
the gtx 1070 are well suited to playing
today's games at 1080p Ultra settings at
frame rates above 60fps the display it's
a 120 Hertz g-sync panel so again very
well suited to this gtx 1070 laptop
because often you'll be pushing those
frame rates above 60fps that's where the
120 hertz refresh rate really comes into
its own I was reasonably impressed with
the cooling solution despite the fact
that inside it's actually a pretty tiny
heatsink and the main downside I guess
this laptop is it's designed not too
much of a fan of the plastic body that
they've used here and even though it is
reasonably lighter just 2.2 kilograms in
fact it's the lightest gtx 1070 laptop
on the market i just wish that the
design was a little bit more premium for
this price point but that said again
you'll be mostly concerned with the
hardware in the GL 502 vs and a soos has
really delivered a great gaming
experience on this laptop here anyway
