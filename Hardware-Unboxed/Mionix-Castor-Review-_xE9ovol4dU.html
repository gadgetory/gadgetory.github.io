i'm your host Matt and today we're
taking a look at the new cast a mouse
from my onyx Swedish manufacturer my
onyx that a bit of a cult following with
their self-proclaimed expertly crafted
gaming peripherals not the least of
which are their gaming mice the caster
is the latest addition to this pretty
extensive range and it's designed to
suit three different mouse group styles
a palm grip fingertip grip and claw grip
the caster is rather small Mouse overall
and its constructions forged from
plastic four layers of rubber coating
which hopefully won't rub off after a
few intense gaming sessions with the
lights off the designers sleek and
subtle black around including the
braided cable all the way up to the gold
plated USB connector the interior leds
light up the mouse kind of Tron style
around the mouse wheel in the my own
o'clock oh and these can be set to any
color you like as well as pulsating
blinking and breathing effects the mouse
is also specifically designed to
economically suit right-handed users
with specific grooves for your thumb as
well as ring and pinky fingers on the
technical side of things the cast was
loaded with a 32 bit erm processor so
you should never have any troubles with
responsiveness lag or quickly changing
settings in a game and it also uses the
PMW 3310 gaming grade optical sensor
which is apparently the choice of the
world's top pro gamers this sensor in
the caster offers one-to-one tracking
with a zero acceleration sensor that
offers no positive or negative hardware
acceleration and can be configured up to
10,000 dpi there's also a 128 kilobytes
in memory to store up to five macro
profiles and all six buttons are fully
programmable there's also a bunch of
software features if you really want to
get your mouse note on you can adjust
the XY axis change the pooling rate use
the surface quality analyzer tool and
calibrate the liftoff distance basically
anything you want to calibrate you can
the cast is a really nice feeling mouse
it's quite light weighing it just 93
grams
including the cable and really glides
across your mouse pad pretty
effortlessly if you have someone that
likes away to your mouse though you
should probably look elsewhere the four
layers of rubber coating feel great in
the hand and the kind of squishy feeling
textured rubber thumb grip does to the
mouse wheel is quiet and scroll softly
with a dull sort of thudding feel as a
person the clicky feedback that you
might get on the Logitech mouse or
similar personally I found all the
buttons are pleasure to use the back and
forward buttons on the side we're
exactly where I'd like them to be there
was no reaching with my thumb and the
right and left mouse button clicks a
sharper quieter and less hollow sounding
than that of my g502 once i got my
sensitivity dialed in I found the cast
too great to use for gaming as well as
comfortable and easy to use in windows
overall there's nothing I could fold
about the mynocks caster and both
hardcore followers of the brand as well
as newbies we greatly satisfied with
their investment if they choose to get
one thanks for watching hardware on box
i'm your host Matt let me know anything

time yeah
