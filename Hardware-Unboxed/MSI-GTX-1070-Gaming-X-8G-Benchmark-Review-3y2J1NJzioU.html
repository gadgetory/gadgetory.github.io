gaming x 8g using the company's latest
twin frozen six cooler there are three
twin throws of six models which are
called the gaming 8g gaming x ag and
gaming z 8g the standard gaming model
apparently misses out on the IDB
lighting and operates at the reference
clock frequencies then we have the
special x and z models both of which
feature fancy lighting and come factory
overclocked you might assume that the x
version is the more extreme of the two
but that isn't the case the set actually
comes at the highest clock speeds but
before we check out the clock speeds
let's take a look at the 1070 gaming xhe
board design and cooler the latest
generation twin frozen features tox 2.0
fans zero frozen stay smooth heat pipes
and air flow control technology okay so
he for marketing nonsense there but what
does it all mean the talks 2.0 fan
feature means there are two fans working
together to cool the 1070 game eshg
the fan blade design is said to generate
22% more air pressure which improves
cooling performance and reduces the
operating volume every second fin
features a steeper curved blade which
accelerates the air flow apparently
increasing its effectiveness
the fans are supported by double ball
bearings - which - improves your ability
longevity and help to reduce the
operating volume zero frozen technology
eliminates fan noise and low load
situations by stopping the fans when
they're not needed GPU temperatures can
rise up to roughly 60 degrees before the
fans are become active unlike some of
the extreme cards we've seen from the
likes of gigabyte in game with the 1070
gaming xhe isn't a triple slot card
instead we have a 42 millimeter wide
dual slot card and despite that it still
manages to squeeze in two large fans on
top of a rather big heat sink which is
supported by a squad of five nickel
plated copper heat pipes these heat
pipes have been smooth on the base of
the heatsink to ensure maximum contact
with the copper base plate which has
also been nickel-plated MSI tells us
that a premium thermal compound has been
applied to ensure optimal heat transfer
from the GPU to the base plate it looks
like pretty standard stuff but then I
guess you can't really tell how premium
a thermal compound is by just looking at
it so we'll have to take that word on it
covering the heatsink is an impressive
red and black theme fan shroud that
comes even more impressive once the
cards been powered up once active the
embedded LEDs make this graphics card
come to life the lighting can be
controlled with the MSI gaming app and
there's a few pretty cool effects on
offer here too
the shroud just overhangs the PCB taking
the card to a total length of 279
millimeters so pretty standard stuff for
a gtx 1070 graphics card however what
isn't standard is the height this thing
stands 140 millimeters tall thanks to a
super-sized PCB that we'll look at now
on the rear of the card we find a full
size black back plate which features
some neat looking cutouts along with a
cool silhouette of a dragon the
backplate doesn't feature any
backlighting on the X model whereas on
this dead model it does removing the
bulk of the cooling we find two
additional heat spreaders covering the
gddr5 memory as well as the vrm area so
that's great to see with a 1070 gaming
xhe strip completely naked we get a good
look at the massive PCB and how msi is
designed this graphics card as is often
the case with high-end MSI graphics
cards their military class 4 grade
components have been used this is
another marketing exercise for the most
part but there's still some good stuff
here such as the super farad chokes and
the component selection does follow mal
STD 8 100 G certification speaking of
chokes we find a 10-plus two-phase
design on board which when coupled with
an additional 6 pin connector will be
able to keep gtx 1075 with enough power
to maintain those 2.1 gigahertz
overclocks
out of the box the card operates at a
base clock of 1582 megahertz with a
boost clock of 1771 megahertz which is a
mild five percent overclock using the
msi software gamers can switch to an OC
mode setting which improves the base
clock to 1607 megahertz for a boost of
1797 megahertz of course thanks to
invidious unpredictable GPU boost 3.0
technology the card will likely run
higher than the 1797 megahertz for the
most part for quick and easy
overclocking gamers can refer to the MSI
gaming app which allows for quick
switching between the various operating
modes games can also control the LED
lighting here as well and it's possible
to enable on-screen overlay information
too then for some serious overclocking
MSI has their separate afterburner
utility afterburners a program I often
use for GPU overclocking but it's nice
to actually use it to overclock an msi
card with afterburner we increase the
voltage percent to plus 100
the power limit to 126 percent this
allowed the core clock to be increased
by 140 megahertz and the memory clock by
600 megahertz gpu-z tells us this is a
17 47 megahertz base clock and a 1937
megahertz boost clock which seems much
lower than what we're able to do with
the gigabyte 1070 extreme gaming of
course to do invidious GPU boost 3.0 we
know the car can run faster than the
suggester boost clock if kept under the
thermal and power targets in the case of
the extreme gaming this allowed the card
to hold an operating frequency of 20 139
megahertz after 20 minutes stress test
which is bloody awesome the msi 1070
gaming x 8g was just as impressive in
fact more so held a frequency of 20 167
megahertz during the same stress test so
then I guess it's time to see how
performs let's jump into the benchmarks
and see how it got on out of the box the
gaming acts with just a single frame
slower than the extreme gaming and 5 fps
faster than the fans Edition so a good
result for MSI however better still of
the customer clocking results is the
gaming expect the extreme gaming by four
fps margin to get within 7 FPS at the GD
X 1080 founders Edition graphics card
again out of the box the gaming ax is
just a single frame slower than the
extreme gaming yet once overclocked it
overtakes the extreme gaming by a
convincing margin with a 73 FPS average
that's a decent 12 percent boost over
the factory overclock and 20% faster
than the founders Edition graphics card
this time the gaming X was 2 FPS slower
than the extreme gaming out of the box
there was 5 FPS faster than the founders
addition once overclocked the gaming X
again came on strong sustaining an
average of 92 fps making it for FPS
faster than the extreme gaming this was
a 7% boost over the overclocked founders
Edition and 19% faster than the stock
reference graphics card which is really
impressive now this is where things get
interesting
the gtx 1070 founds Edition consumes
very little power our entire test system
consumed just 236 watts on average while
gaming with it installed and overclocked
the founders edition raised the total
power usage to just 245 watts out of the
box the MSI gaming acts push the system
consumption to 254 watts an 8% increase
over the Nvidia reference card compared
to the extreme gaming the MSI model only
increased the total system consumption
by 2 percent nothing to write home about
here however once we take our maximum
custom overclocked results into account
we find a different story when I
reviewed the gigabyte 1070 extreme
gaming last week I was surprised by how
much power consumed to an overclocked
pushing the system usage 272 watts the
MSI model smashes that figure reaching
295 Watts virtually the same power draw
scene when using the gigabyte GT X 1080
Xtreme gaming this that explains why the
MSI gaming X is able to produce such
impressive results when overclocked
still this makes me wonder how the third
was impacted as well as the operating
volume surprisingly despite the
increased power draw when overclocked
the gaming acts only around two degrees
hotter than its out-of-the-box
configuration at 68 degrees the car was
obviously quite cool when compared to
the stock 77 degree operating
temperatures of the founders edition
still it did run quite a bit hotter than
the massive gigabyte extreme gaming card
which just managed to keep below 60
degrees when using the factory overclock
what's interesting or rather surprising
is that the 1070 gaming s didn't
generate any more noise once overclocked
the card remained whisper quiet as the
fans continued to spin it just 1,100 rpm
this is an incredible result especially
considering it allowed the card to
maintain a clock speed in excess of 2.1
gigahertz ever sized delivered what I
expect to be one of the very best
geforce gtx 1070 graphics cards around
out of the box the gaming has pretty
much matched the frame rate performance
of gigabytes extreme gaming the thermals
weren't as impressive despite being a
big improvement over the fans edition
still it's worth noting that the extreme
gaming does take up three slots whereas
the gaming x is a more traditional two
slot card the higher overclocking temp
the gaming ax didn't impact the
overclocking performance either in fact
we're able to extract around 20% more
performance when compared to the stock
fans edition which was mighty impressive
the only potential blemish on an
otherwise perfect report card is the
power consumption overclock the gaming X
was a bit of a power Pig consuming
almost 30 watts more than the 1080
founders Edition roughly 60 watts more
than the 1070 founders edition it also
consumed a little over 20 watts more
than the overclocked extreme gaming
out of the box the power consumption was
very similar to the extreme gaming's
there isn't much of an issue there even
so our custom overclock didn't push the
total system draw above 300 watts and
that includes a core i7 6700 K processor
clocked and locked at 4.5 gigahertz so
in reality the power consumption
shouldn't be an issue particularly given
how cool
and quiet the gaming X runs on
overclocked the only other potential
issue is the design how the card looks
personally I really like it though I
recognize you ideally want to have a red
and black theme going on which
thankfully for MSI seems to be 97% of
all gamers the LED lighting is cool
though the RGB side logo is a little
pointless given the LEDs on the face of
the card can't be changed from red
price-wise the 1070 gaming ax is
currently 460 u.s. or 750 ozzie right
now the lowest asking price for a 1070
on newegg.com is 430 us nut card happens
to be the msi 1070 r murrow c so they
really aren't charging much of a premium
for the gaming X in a nutshell the msi
gtx 1070 gaming x 8g is quiet
overclocked swell provides excellent
out-of-the-box performance operates at
sub 70 degree temperatures doesn't throw
it well even when overclocked and only
takes up two slots so in other words
it's a real winner what do you guys
