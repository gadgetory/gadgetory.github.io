mechanical keyboard I really wanted to
have everything and it looks like the
g.skill ripjaws km 780 RGB might just
tick all the boxes g.skill of course
typically known for their high
performance memory but last year they
entered the peripherals market and today
I'm gonna find out whether they're a
real player the km 780 is a pretty cool
looking keyboard in my opinion it's a
full sized full layout board with a
wealth of extra keys including 6g keys
which Logitech might have something to
say about lining the left-hand side of
the keyboard
which can of course be assigned to any
function there's for macro control keys
at the very top left followed by a
Windows lock key to disable the Windows
Keys during gaming a three step
backlight brightness toggle and
something I haven't seen before in a
keyboard a timer key with g.skill
software installed this allows you to
set a quick time and a remind you of
anything you want with lighting effect
on the keyboard in the top right hand
corner there's also five media control
keys with the volume wheel and a volume
indicator showing you your current
windows volume level pretty damn cool
the only downside to this is these
lights are stuck on red so you can't
make them match the rest of your
keyboard if you're not using an
all-around red design the overall feel
of the design is industrial I'd say the
backplate is nice looking brushed
aluminium with the g.skill logo at the
top center either side of the keys or
two brackets which support the pipe that
wraps around the sides and back of the
keyboard this pipe isn't just for looks
either it actually holds the custom key
cap case and the mouse cable guide both
of which can be slid along this pipe to
a location of your choice a large
removable wrist rest can be attached at
the front of the keyboard and this
features a nice texturized plastic
insert the underside of the keyboard is
simple just between two flip-down legs
to prop up the keyboard the braided
cable for the km7 80 is thick thick
enough to carry USB and audio
pass-through and splits off at the end
for these functions the ports which can
be found at the right back of the
keyboard
these are inclusions that I love to see
and I find USB pass-through extremely
handy though it'll be great when we
start seeing USB 3.1 onboard I mentioned
earlier a custom key cap case
cheese coolers included bright red
texturized and aggressively shaped keys
for gamers that like to feel the
difference between
they go to keys and the others the WASD
keys are extremely aggressively shaped I
personally found these pretty annoying
for you some general typing and even
gaming if I'm honest they take a lot of
getting used to but we can only
compliment you skill for this extra
inclusion really the included key cap
removal tool is great to have to a
neutral color for the keys may have
worked better too since this is an RGB
keyboard g.skill seems to live red the
key caps are also slightly different
heights for a slightly contoured outlay
which I personally didn't notice very
much at all
but it felt good so I suppose I liked it
there isn't too much to say about the
switches that hasn't already been said
the Cherry MX browns and of course
there's some of the best you can buy the
keyboard also comes in Cherry MX red and
blue the lighting behind these switches
is pretty good it's not the brightest
I've seen but it was definitely
satisfactory and created a nice glow
around the keys on the military grade
aluminium backplate here's how the keys
sound when typed on for those interested
the software that goes with this
keyboard is serviceable it's definitely
nothing special and it took me a little
longer than normal to figure out how to
do things so a little work can be done
on the UF side of things but it
definitely serves all the purposes it
should and I don't have any specific
complaints one thing I really liked
about this keyboard is the fact that the
profiles can be saved directly to the
device this means you don't need to have
the software constantly running and when
you switch PCs your lighting and macro
settings come with you overall I love
what G school have done with this
keyboard for once I'm not reaching this
conclusion section with a list of
features I wish have been included this
thing really has it all and then some
extras like the key caps case and
removal tool Mouse cable router LED
volume indicator and timer key are all
features I could comfortably go without
but I'm certainly happy to have them USB
pass-through the big wrist rest and
Cherry MX switches are all features that
I personally love to see included though
I have been impressed with custom
switches from other manufacturers lately
so with all these features included this
keyboard must cost an absolute fortune
right wrong in Australia you can pick it
up for 109
from a few online retailers and if you
don't care about RGB and get the km7 a
dmx LED for a hundred and fifty nine
dollars this is a pretty unbelievable
price for a flagship keyboard of this
caliber and with this feature set Amazon
has the keyboard for 140 US dollars and
if someone can point me to a similar
keyboard for around this price and
please do so thanks for joining me for
