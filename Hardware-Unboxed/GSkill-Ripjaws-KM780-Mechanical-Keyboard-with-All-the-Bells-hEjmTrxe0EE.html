mechanical keyboard I really wanted to
have everything and it looks like the
g.skill ripjaws km 780 RGB might just
take all the boxes g.skill of course
typically known for their high
performance memory but last year they
entered the peripherals market and today
I'm going to find out whether they are a
real player the km 780 is a pretty cool
looking keyboard in my opinion it's a
full-size full layout board with a
wealth of extra keys including 6g keys
which logitech might have something to
say about lining the left hand side of
the keyboard which can of course be
assigned to any function there's four
macro control key is at the very top
left followed by a windows lock key to
disable the windows keys during gaming a
three-step backlight brightness toggle
and something I haven't seen before in a
keyboard a timer key with g.skill
software installed this allows you to
set a quick time and a remind you of
anything you want with lighting effect
on the keyboard in the top right-hand
corner there's also five media control
keys with the volume wheel and a volume
indicator showing you your current
windows volume level pretty damn cool
the only downside to this is these
lights are stuck on red so you can't
make them match the rest of your
keyboard if you're not using an all
round red design the overall feel of the
design is industrial I'd say the back
plate is nice looking brushed aluminium
with the g.skill logo at the top center
either side of the keys or two brackets
which support the pipe the wraps around
the sides and back of the keyboard this
pipe isn't just for looks either it
actually holds the custom key cap case
and the mouse cable guide both of which
can be slid along this pipe to a
location of your choice a large
removable wrist rest can be attached to
the front of the keyboard and this
features a nice texturized plastic
insert the underside of the keyboard is
simple just featuring to flip down legs
to prop up the keyboard the braided
cable 4km 780 is thick thick enough to
carry USB and audio pass through and
splits off at the end for these
functions the ports which can be found
at the right back of the keyboard these
are inclusions that I love to see and I
find USB passthrough extremely handy
though it'll be great when we start
sending USB 3.1 on board I mentioned
earlier a custom key cap case g.skill is
included bright red texturized and
aggressively shaped keys the gamers that
like to feel a difference between
they go to keys and the others the WASD
keys are extremely aggressively shaped I
personally found these pretty annoying
for use in general typing and even
gaming if I'm honest they take a lot of
getting used to but we can only
compliment g.skill for this extra
inclusion really the included key cap
removal tool is great to have to a
neutral color for the keys may have
worked better too since this is an RGB
keyboard g.skill seems to live read the
key caps are also slightly different
heights for a slightly contort outlay
which I personally didn't notice very
much at all but it felt good so I
suppose I liked it there isn't too much
to say about the switches that hasn't
already been said the cherry MX browns
and of course there's some of the best
you can buy the keyboard also comes in
Cherry MX red and blue the lighting
behind these switches is pretty good
it's not the brightest I've seen but it
was definitely satisfactory and created
a nice glow around the keys on the
military grade aluminium backplate
here's how the keys sound when typed on
for those interested the software that
goes with this keyboard is serviceable
it's definitely nothing special and it
took me a little longer than normal to
figure out how to do things so a little
work can be done on the US side of
things but it definitely serves all the
purposes that should and I don't have
any specific complaints one thing I
really like about this keyboard is the
fact that the profiles can be saved
directly to the device this means you
don't need to have the software
constantly running and when you switch
pcs your lighting and macro settings
come with you overall I love what
g.skill have done with this keyboard for
once I'm not reaching this conclusion
section with a list of features I wish
have been included this thing really has
it all and then some extras like the key
caps case and removal tool mouse cable
router led volume indicator and timer
key are all features I could comfortably
go without but I'm certainly happy to
have them USB passed through the big
wrist rest and cherry MX switches role
features that i personally love to see
included though i have been impressed
with custom switches from other
manufacturers lately so with all these
features included this keyboard must
cost an absolute fortune right wrong in
australia you can pick it up for 109
nine dollars from a few online retailers
if you don't care about RGB and get the
km 7 a dmx LED for 159 dollars this is a
pretty unbelievable price for a flagship
keyboard of this caliber and with this
feature set amazon has the keyboard for
140 US dollars and if someone can point
me to a similar keyboard for around this
price and please do so thanks for
