on the channel I find myself talking
about high end laptops like beefy gaming
machines or sleek ultra portables well
today we're going to the complete
opposite end of the spectrum to talk
about an entry-level laptop that was
sent to me out of the blue by Chinese
OEM Chewie at least I'm pretty sure
that's how it's pronounced anyway the
laptop in question is the Chewie lap
book air which is built as an ultra
portable like 14 inch machine with a
price tag of just 430 US dollars this
puts it in the realm of some of the
cheapest Windows laptops on the market
of this display size Chromebooks are
also available for 400 bucks or less but
we'll just keep those over the dance
corner for now because we're mostly
interested in true Windows systems here
so what does 430 bucks get you well if
you're more familiar with top-end
Hardware you might have heard of the CPU
used in the lap book air it's the Intel
Celeron n 34 50 and Apollo Lake SOC that
uses Intel's gold monster
microarchitecture which is designed for
low end power efficient systems it's a 6
watt SOC with 4 CPU cores and 4 threads
clocked up to 2.2 gigahertz with a 1.1
gigahertz base plus Intel HD graphics
500 which has 12 execution units clocked
up to 700 megahertz the lopaka also
packs 8 gig of ddr3 RAM and a 128 gig
SSD both of which are not bad inclusions
at all in an entry-level system along
with a 14 point one inch 1080p IPS LCD
it's all sounding pretty good so far and
it gets even better when you take a look
at the design if you've seen entry-level
notebooks before most of them pack a
bland plastic and generally terrible
designs they're really built just to
contain the hardware and screen for the
lowest possible cost but that's not the
case at all with the lap book air is
what we're getting here would be
acceptable even on a high-end system the
build here is fairly basic from a visual
standpoint with nothing unique or stand
out in that regard but the key feature
here is the use of metal on all sites
along with glass protecting the display
it's
ready to see this sort of quality
materials used on a low-end machine so
chewy is definitely targeting those that
want a beautiful design for the lowest
possible price
however Chuy's marketing materials do
exaggerate the dimensions of this laptop
to the point where it's almost false
advertising it is a pretty slim machine
at this price point but it's nowhere
near as slim as the product pictures
make out the images make it seem like
the front end of the wedge design sits
flush on your desk when in fact it's
raised up by a bulge that chewy has
attempted to disguise through curves and
other standard visual trickery later on
they claim this front section is just 6
millimeters thick which I guess is
technically correct if you don't count
the Bulge but my measurements put the
real thickness at more like 14
millimeters which again it's pretty good
for an entry level system but it would
have been nice if truly presented a more
realistic picture of the machine on
their website though this isn't the only
dodgy thing you can find on their
website in the performance section they
talk about the glod Mont architecture
and how it performances faster and later
on their show images that clearly
misrepresent the bezel size again the
bezels are quite reasonable for an
entry-level product but on Chuy's
website they are shown to be much
slimmer than in reality aside from that
dodging is though the rest of the design
is filled with decent inclusions there's
two USB 3.0 ports a mini HDMI port a
micro SD card slot and a 3.5 mm jack
along with a proprietary power connector
I would prefer a full sized SD card slot
over micro SD but that's just a bit of a
nitpick to be honest the keyboard it's
great too with a surprisingly large
travel distance and great clicky
response or what I imagined definitely
isn't the most expensive laptop keycaps
you can buy each key is appropriately
sized and I appreciate the large
modifiers and full-size error Keys
having page up page down and so forth on
the right of the enter and backspace
keys it's a little annoying but in
general the typing experience is great
it's even backlit and that's a feature
that's often cut from budget systems the
trackpad on the other hand is pretty bad
it lacks precision for fine movement
and it feels quite sluggish to use as if
the polling rate isn't quite high enough
for typical usage I didn't expect every
aspect of this laptop to be amazing and
it's clear the track pairs one
department that's received a few budget
cuts I wasn't expecting the display to
be particularly amazing though in some
aspects this IPS panel did perform
better than I anticipated especially as
it has a 1080p resolution brightness
could be a bit better though 266 nits
isn't bad and you do get a decent
contrast ratio around 1150 to one and
great viewing angles
chewie have also done okay in terms of
white balance and greyscale leading to a
70 100 K temperature average and a three
point zero to Delta a average that's
better than a lot more expensive
notebooks the problem comes with gamut
coverage and this is a standard area
where manufacturers look to cut costs
rather than producing a hundred percent
of the srgb spectrum like you'd want
from a decent display the lapdog air
hits just 67 point four percent so
colors look muted and under saturated if
this was a high-end device I would slam
it a bit for poor color performance but
a lot of entry-level laptops suffer from
the same camera issues so it's hardly a
big problem in this class of device so
let's talk about performance because the
lap book air with its Celeron n 3450
isn't a speed demon by any means even a
regular pace of demon instead the n 3450
is pretty slow and that's not at all
surprising considering it uses gold
montt cause rather than skylake or kb
lake from the moment you power and use
this device for the first time is clear
you won't be using this laptop anything
outside of light web browsing and
document creation it's here you'll
really be reminded that despite that
pretty exterior the insides are
definitely low-end I'm not going to
focus on any one benchmark in great
detail but across the charts you'll see
over the next few minutes you'll see the
n 3450 compared to other mobile chips
like the cherry trail x5z 8550 which
uses air mont cores from the generation
before goals mont along with more recent
skylake and cable eight core m core i3
and core i5 cpus i have left out the 8th
gen k blake refresh here because you
won't find those chips in any product
even remote
closing price to the black book the
basic story here is the N 3450 is very
slow it's similar in performance to the
x5z 8550 but a long way behind most
other CPUs even Core M processes that
have a low at ATP something like the
core m36 by 30 is around twice as fast
and single thread workloads and in the
range of 45 to 60% faster when all
caused a hit and the M 360 Y 30 isn't
exactly a fast see for you it gets even
worse looking at the skylake core i3
6100 u which is in the range of two
point one to two point two times faster
on a single core and eighty to ninety
percent faster on all coarse move up the
chain to the i-5 7200 U and it gets a
dire for the N thirty four fifty as it
gets bullied with up to 2.9 times the
single core power and at least twice the
multi-core power and when we're talking
about performance limited mobile chips
getting smashed in this way is not good
news now you're probably thinking why
have I compared an entry-level n 3450 to
something like the core i5 7200 u or
Core i3 6100 year when it's obvious
these CPUs will be significantly faster
well the reason is simple in the $400 to
$500 price bracket where the chewy lap
book air sits you can buy laptops that
include processes like this which
provides significantly more performance
this dell inspiron 13-inch convertible
for example cost the same amount as the
latter book aid yet it features a core
i3 70 100 you which would be a decent
alternative if you want something
portable but crave decent performance
instead if you care less about the form
factor asa has a 350 dollar 15 inch
notebook that gives you once again the
core i3 70 100 you or for $40 more you
can get this HP system with a core i5
7200 you now granted these aren't
equivalent systems the Acer and Dell
models I mentioned pack just four
gigabytes of RAM while the HP system
doesn't include a 1080p display and all
use one terabyte hard drives instead of
the 128 gig SSD in the lap book air
but if you're looking at getting the
best performance for your dollar all
three models provide a lot more
performance even when hampered by a hard
drive and it's much easier to swap out a
slow higher drive for an SSD then it is
to swap out a slow CPU for something
faster and that's the real crux of the
problem with the lap book air the
Celeron and 3450 isn't meant for this
price point it's more commonly found in
sub $300 laptops where cost-cutting in
every aspect is commonplace for four
hundred and thirty dollars it's all well
and good to have an excellent design but
not before you deliver a reasonable
level of performance at the price now I
do like some things chewy has attempted
here the SanDisk DF 41:28 SSD isn't
gonna blow you away with speed but it
does provide a noticeable upgrade over a
hard drive and there's even an
accessible end up to expansion slot for
adding more storage in the future
getting Intel a Wi-Fi AC in this sort of
system rather than a dirt cheap Wi-Fi n
module is a nice bonus too but some
extra cash could have been put into the
processor had Chewie opted for say four
gig of ram instead of eight gig because
a gig has little benefit over four gig
with such a slow CPU and again Ram is
easy to upgrade than a CPU one thing I
haven't talked about yet is the battery
life and with a 33.7 one hour battery
inside you shouldn't expect anything
amazing even with the slow in 34:54
video playback I changed around 5.5
hours which isn't surprising for this
sort of battery capacity and this
similar sort of performance carries over
to the other benchmarks you certainly
won't get ultra portable class battery
from this sort of system but it's
serviceable enough from an entry-level
device at the end though it's hard to
recommend the system to most people
because the performance simply isn't up
to scratch for the asking price this
isn't a bad laptop at all the design is
fantastic the keyboard is great there's
decent features for an entry-level
laptop and the display is an awful by
any stretch but it should cost either
fifty to a hundred dollars less or it
should come with a faster processor it's
pretty much as simple as that as it
stands right now I can only recommend
the lap book err to those who value
design and portability above all else
other buyers looking to spend around
four hundred and fifty dollars should
look into some of the systems from Dell
HP
aisa I mentioned earlier links to which
you can find in the description below
the best wishes to Chewie though as I
think with a bit of refinement a system
like the lateral care could be a
standout option in the budget laptop
market it's just not there at the moment
but that's it for now back to the
benchmark lab for me and I'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
