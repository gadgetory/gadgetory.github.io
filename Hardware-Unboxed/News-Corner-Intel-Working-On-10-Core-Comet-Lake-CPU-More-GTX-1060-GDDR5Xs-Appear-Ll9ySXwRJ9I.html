news corner it's good to be back for the
second week in a row in our usual Friday
slot but perhaps there hasn't been as
much news this week as we'd normally see
I guess that's what tends to happen when
we get close to December the news gets
dried up a little bit as companies
mostly focus on holiday sales and
preparing for bigger events in 2019 like
see yes still a few interesting stories
though so let's kick things off first
story from this week is more of a rumor
that I wanted to get out of the way
early because it's generated a bit of
discussion according to some random
person on a Taiwanese forum as person on
wucf tech Intel is working on a new
generation of s-series desktop
processors called common lake that will
bring 10 cores manufactured using 14
animators the CPU is also said to use a
dual ring bus interconnect and that's
basically all the information that was
shared down face value this seems
reasonable over the past few years
intel has been steadily increasing the
core count of their flagship desktop
CPUs from four cores with seventh gen
processes up to eight cores with current
ninth gen parts so moving to 10 cores
with the future processor sounds about
right
Manufacturing the chip on 40 nanometers
also is a possibility given Intel
struggles with 10 nanometers and without
any architectural changes to drive
performance improvements simply adding
more cores is one way to speed up a new
chip in multi-core workloads Intel of
course we'll need a new CPU to compete
with third-generation AMD rising CPUs
which have been built on 7 nanometers
and we use the company's overhauled Zen
2 architecture there's the possibility
these CPUs will pack up to 16 cores with
higher clock speeds and major
improvements to make them more
competitive with current generation
Intel silicon so if Intel can't get a 10
nanometer chip out they're basically
left with no choice but to add more
cores on 40 nanometers but like with a
lot of rumors this one is filled with
red flags firstly it's a random post on
a Taiwanese forum I mean come on that is
not some sort of verified source that
has delivered accurate information in
the past literally anyone can post any
rubbish on a foreign language forum that
doesn't mean it's
gentlemen and secondly while the fate of
Intel's 10 nanometers is still up in the
air the word from the company at the
moment is they are on track to ship 10
animated products in 2019 whether that's
a cut down version of intel's original
10 nanometer plans or the real 10
nanometers is unclear but at this stage
we're expecting something 10 nanometers
next year plus it seems Intel has done
already all it can do on their 14
nanometer plus plus note the current
core o 919 900k runs hot and consumes a
ton of power and that won't get any
better if you try and shove another two
cores into the mix so this woman doesn't
smell quite right to me I'd certainly be
waiting until 2019 to see what Intel has
in store there's another reason why
waiting until 2019 might be a good idea
Intel is set to discuss their
next-generation CPU architecture at an
event on December 11th if Intel are
ready to talk about the next
architecture it would certainly be
strange to then go and race a new
comet-like processor on 40 nanometer
plus plus that basically it just adds
two more cores with roughly the same
architecture as Skylink of course
comet-like could be using an overhauled
architecture on 14 nanometer that's a
possibility
if Intel are going to use a dual ring
bus design but in the past Intel haven't
bothered to hold architecture events to
talk about the minor differences between
skylake cable a canned coffee like
instead leaving most of those
announcements to the actual product
unveils later in the year you'd think if
Intel we're holding an architecture
event this far ahead of any new CPUs
there would be something interesting to
talk about in any case the fact the
event is relating to CPU architectures
means the event is not about GPUs there
were some rumors floating around that
Intel would use their december event to
unveiled their discrete GPU architecture
but those rumors were a load of BS
because interests confirm the event is
solely about CPUs with Intel still
targeting 2024 GPUs it would certainly
be too early to be talking about GPS at
this stage there naturally there's a lot
of excitement about what Intel will do
in that space samsung has launched a new
affordable SSD line called the 860
couvreux yes QV oh these drives are
available in a 2.5 inch form factor and
interface over SATA offering acceptable
performance for a budget drive that
slots in below the 860 Evo
the name couvreux refers to the fact
these drives are using new qlc memory
which can store four bits per cell and
is set to become the standard across
cheaper drives the cool thing about the
eight-six DQ bro line is the drives come
at a cost of just fifteen cents per
gigabyte and are available in 1 2 and 4
terabyte capacities so the one terabyte
model is one hundred and fifty dollars
the two terabyte $300 and the four
terabyte is $600 right speeds aren't
fantastic due to the nature of qlc but
it's hard to pass up that sort of value
if you need a high-capacity affordable
SSD AMD has launched a new CPU and cool
a bundle that gives buys the beefier
wraith max cooler with either the risin
5 2600 x or the risin 7 2700 these
processes normally come with the wraith
spire or wraith spire LED coolers which
are decent enough for a box cooler but
the max is a fair bit larger and handles
overclocking better thanks to its 200
watt heat dissipation rating in the UK
the wraith max bundle costs around 15 to
20 pounds more than the cpu with the
standard box cooler the wraith max alone
cost 50 pounds so it's decent value if
you were after a better air cooler for
your rice and processor the bundles are
also expected to hit amazon Newegg and
other retailers soon both MSI and ZOTAC
have jumped onboard the geforce gtx 1060
with gddr5 x memory bandwagon
these cards are basically the same as
the existing gtx 1066 gigabyte right
down to core configurations clock speeds
and even memory clock speeds so despite
the cards using gddr5 X instead of gddr5
they're still clocked at 8 gigabits per
second on the memory in some ways that's
good news for consumers as there should
be no performance difference between the
gddr5 and gddr5 X versions of the GTX
1060 what these new versions will
provide is extra memory overclocking
Headroom the cards also reportedly using
GP 104 silicon rather than CP 106
although again Nvidia is cutting this
GPU down to GTX 1060 size anyway so
there's no real difference here the MSI
model is called the GTX 1066 gigabyte
armor ocv 1 while the zotac version has
the catchy name of gtx 1066 gigabyte g5x
destroyer
as rock has launched a new mid-range x3
99 motherboard called the phantom gaming
6 this new board is designed to sit
below the x3 99 Taichi and as rocks Lana
but it still includes good features like
support for up to 3 Way SLI and
crossfire 3 m dot 2 slots Jul 8 p.m.
hour inputs and USB see the vrm is
perhaps the biggest area where as rock
has cut down compared to the Taichi here
we're looking at according to as rock
and 8 phase design however as Drock
makes it clear in their marketing
materials that this board is only
designed for AMD's 180 watts thread
Ripper CPU so that means everything up
to the 16 chord 2950 X the more
power-hungry 250 watt 32 core 2990 WX is
not meant to be used with this board
which isn't surprising considering the
mid tier vrm although you would have to
wonder how 29 50 X overclocking would go
on this 8 phase design there's no word
on pricing or availability at this stage
though a suit is set to launch a new
display called the ROG Strix XG 32 bqr
shortly packing a 2560 by 1440 V a panel
a maximum 144 Hertz for a fresh straight
and free sync to HDR certification
however I don't expect the HDR
experience to be all that good
considering the panel only conforms to
the Vaser display hgr 400 specification
and doesn't appear to have local dimming
of any kind peak brightness only tops
out at 450 nits though there is 94% DCI
p3 coverage so it will be a wide gamut
monitor no word on pricing at this stage
though these specs were probably looking
around the 400 to 500 dollar mark final
story for this week concerns
AMD's Radeon rx 580 2048 SP which we
first covered on the channel in news
corner a fair while back well I met over
at gamers Nexus managed to get hold of
one of these 2048 SP models and confirm
that it is indeed just a pre overclocked
rx 570 the box even lists rx 580 on it
despite performing like the rx 570 so
it's very deceptive to say the least not
good stuff an AMD though if you are
interested to see how the rx 580 2048 SP
ended up here over the game is Nexus and
check out their full review that's it
for this week's news corner before I go
just want to say a big thanks to
everyone that supported the channel over
the last few years we've just passed
300,000
subscribers which is a neat little
milestone for hardware our box would
have been possible without you guys
