today I have Intel's new core i3 73 50k
on hand that's right an unlocked k
processor the first ever for the core i3
series technically these cable 8 chips
aren't being released until early next
month but at this point Intel's latest
seventh generation series is anything
but a secret for the past few weeks I've
been slaving away at the benchmark rig
gathering results for the upcoming Core
i5 7600 K and core i7 7700 reviews for
next month's release in that time
countless reviews or previews as they're
often being referred to have been linked
making our release day coverage next
month a bit pointless Intel tells me
that the reviews have been released so
far have been based on CPU sourced
anonymously and not supplied directly
from them well hell my i5 7600 and I 777
arcade chips work supplied by Intel
either so I guess I have to ask myself
why I've been waiting till the official
release next month to release my review
honestly I just didn't expect Intel to
sit on their hands and do nothing about
all these leaked reviews that said they
probably aren't too fussed about this
release it's not exactly anything new at
this point we know KB Lake is well a
huge disappointment when compared clock
for clock with sky lake there is quite
literally no difference in performance
and efficiency has only been mildly
improved the kind of improvement you
might expect to see with a more mature
process the new motherboards we've seen
so far look great but truth be told the
new Intel 200 series chipsets really
don't offer anything new either so with
the combination of all the leaked
benchmarks and the fact that KB Lake
just doesn't deliver I was struggling to
find motivation to finish my own
coverage then out of nowhere a pair of
core i3 73 50 K processes landed on my
lap and with no NDA in sight I thought
what the hell let's take a look
obviously when match o'clock 4 o'clock
with a skylight core i3 process so there
isn't going to be anything new here just
the same performance we've come to
expect from a modern core i3 however
this little fellow features an unlocked
clock multiplier just like the skylake
core i5 6600 K or Core i7 6700k
assessors so what we have here is a core
i3 processor featuring two physical
cores but of course like all core i3
processors hyper threading is enabled
here allowing for four threads out of
the box they are clocked quite
aggressively this chip runs at 4.2
gigahertz but it can step down below
that to save power when at idle if the
speedstep technology is enabled at the
bias level and of course it can also be
boosted up higher because this is an
unlocked chip finally like the previous
generation ships or the majority of the
previous generation Core i3 chips the
higher end ones this does have a four
megabyte level three cache last
generations core i3 6320 was the fastest
i3 model we'd seen thus far clocked at
3.9 gigahertz it got along quite well
that said at a cost of around 160 us one
could argue that spending around say $20
more on the core i5 6400 was a much
smarter investment anyway we'll talk
more about that later in the video for
now let's talk about testing since the
200 series boards are still under NDA we
decided to test using an updated z170
motherboard the asrock fatalities at 170
gaming k-6 plus it's proudly in our core
i7 6700k test machine and with the
latest biased revision support to these
70 350 K so we swapped out the 67 okay
and got to it as you might imagine the
i3 73 50 K isn't exactly slow at 4.2
gigahertz but I was keen to see how much
higher the chip could be pushed using
the thermal right exp 200 our CPU cooler
I reached a 100% stable overclock of 4.8
gigahertz not bad but not amazing either
this overclock was stable using 1.3
volts and temps never went above 65
degrees for those wondering I was able
to boot into Windows with the chip as
high as 5 gigahertz but it failed to
pass the more stressful tests the 73 50k
enjoyed a memory bandwidth of 32 point 8
gigabytes per second and ours at 170
tests machine using ddr4 3,200 memory
this is slightly more bandwidth than
these skylake processors had at their
disposal despite using the same
configuration
using Cinebench r15 let's take a look at
the single and multi-threaded
performance of the 73 50k at the stock
4.2 gigahertz frequency it roughly
matches the multi-threaded performance
of the much-loved 2500 K which is of
course a true quad-core processor
albeit an almost six year old one now
thanks to that high operating frequency
the single threaded performance is quite
strong overclock the score is boosted by
13% and while this is a decent
improvement it doesn't really help the
73 50 K close in by a meaningful margin
on the more modern Core i5 processors
before jumping to the gaming and
application results here's a quick look
at the PC mark 8 creative benchmark here
the overclock netted us 9% more
performance resulting in a score of 8410
points that's actually higher than the
stock clocked Core i5 processors still
this is of course a synthetic benchmark
so let's not read too much into those
results just yet out of the box the 73
50k was surprisingly capable in Gears of
War for delivering an average of 96 FPS
overclock the frame rate was boosted by
14% 209 FPS which was enough to overtake
the stock clocked core i7 2670 8 percent
faster than the previous generation 6100
model which makes sense given it has a
30% clock speed advantage testing
overwatch saw the overclocked 73 50k
boost the average frame rate by 16%
allowing it to reach 219 FPS this made
it a good bit faster than the stock core
i5 2500 K but still quite a bit slower
than the 46 70 K at the stock clock
speeds I did notice occasional
stuttering with the 73 50k in
battlefield 1 this is despite pushing
well over 60 FPS at all times
overclocking the CPU to 4.0 gigahertz
seemed to solve this and we're now
achieving a 130 FPS average matching the
core i7 2600
the last game I tested was the CPU
intensive watchdogs to hear the 73 50k
only allowed for an average of 46 FPS
out of the box
dipping down to 37 fps
time's the game didn't appear to suffer
from stuttering issues that said
stuttering was a major problem with the
2500 K at its stock clocks we'd
overclocked we extracted 30% more
performance out of the core i3 processor
and it was now delivering a very smooth
experience moving on from gaming we have
the Excel Monte Carlo workload which
took the 73 50k a total of seven point
six seconds to complete overclocking
reduced that time to 7.2 seconds and
this is a 6% reduction but you aren't
exactly going to notice it this also
only placed the 73 50k alongside the
stock 2500 K in terms of performance
okay so how about content creation on a
budget once again we find when
overclocked these 73 50k is only able to
match the stock 2500 K and AMD FX 8350
kind of encoding work you're best off
getting a true quad core processor as
we've come to expect from Intel's Core
i3 range the 7350 K is very efficient
overclocking kills efficiency with that
added voltage we saw an 81% boosting
consumption for a 14% increase in
frequency similar results can be seen
when testing with prime95 here the
consumption increased by 66% placing the
one sufficient 7350 K alongside the much
more powerful core i7 processors in
terms of power usage for the longest
time now myself and many others have
been asking Intel to release an unlocked
core i3 processor finally the time has
come and I'm starting to think you
should be careful what you wish for
actually in this case it really is just
a matter of too little too late
an unlocked Ivy Bridge core i3 would
have been amazing and unlocked as well
would have been pretty cool as well and
unlocks sky like maybe but for what's
going to be a 2017 release and unlocked
dual core with hyper-threading support
is pretty underwhelming in terms of
performance it isn't exactly slow though
having said that for the most part it
only kept pace with these stock clocked
Sandy Bridge chips which as I said
earlier they are approaching the
six-year-old mark and in the life of a
CPU this pretty much makes them
great-great-grandparents
that kind of performance becomes an
issue when you take cost into account
and I'm not just talking about the price
of the 73 50k though that in itself
could be a real issue as well the
previous generation i3 6320 currently
costs a hundred and sixty us and we can
pretty much guarantee Intel will
introduce the 73 50k at a ten to twenty
dollar premium but let's give them the
benefit out and say $10 at a hundred and
seventy u.s. that is a mighty expensive
dual-core processor and for roughly ten
dollars more you can land the core i5
6400 keep in mind we did test the 6600 K
at its stock frequency and here isn't
much faster than the 6400 so you can
safely assume the 6400 is going to
demolish an overclocked 73 50 K making
matters worse the core i5 6400 doesn't
require an aftermarket cooler to achieve
maximum performance the stock box cooler
is ample here
it also doesn't require an expensive ZD
Series motherboard a cheap h1 10 board
will work fine since the z2 70 boards
are the only models with overclocking
support I have to imagine this is what
the 70 350 K will require then throw in
another $30 or so for a decent air
cooler and you are now head and
shoulders above what an entry-level core
i5 setup would cost then there's that
little matter of power consumption
overclock those two cores drink like
it's their last night on earth so taking
all that into account what do I think
about the new KB lake core i3 processor
particularly this unlocked model well I
think you guys ought to steer clear of
it anyway that's my opinion what do you
guys think let me know in the comments
below I'm your host Steve and I'll catch
you guys next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
