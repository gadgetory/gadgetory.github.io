I'm your host Matt and this right here
is the new rival 100 gaming mouse the
low cost high performance solution from
SteelSeries at just 40 dollars the rival
100 aims to be the best of its budget
gaming mice class many all the
necessities for basic gaming without
including expensive additional features
that would drive the price up
appearance-wise the rival 100 is quite
nice actually think it's better looking
the summer SteelSeries other more
expensive - such as the sensei I prefer
the non pixelated SteelSeries logo and
all-around look and symmetrical contours
this nice appearance is aided by full
RGB lighting that illuminates both the
aforementioned logo and either side of
the scroll wheel
rounding out its looks is a dotted
texture grip pad on both sides of the
mouse as you can see on here we have the
black editions but you can now choose
from six other colorways including white
red green yellow purple and even gold
the only non symmetrical part of the
mouse are the browsing some buttons on
the left side the render are more suited
to right-handed users these buttons give
a satisfying tactile click as to the
left and right mouse buttons the scroll
wheel rotates relatively softly and can
also be of course clicked the final
button on the mouse is a dpi switch that
can toggle between just two dpi settings
on the go the cable is light but not
braided and replaceable Teflon feet
underneath provides smooth Glide the
sensor featured on this mouse is a
custom optical sensor specifically
engineered for the rival 100 by steel
series in hand with Pixar is 305 9ss
optical Gaming sensor is not accelerated
that anyway can move between 8 and 4,000
counts per inch and read acceleration up
to 20 G it also offers a lower lift off
distance without sacrificing accuracy
you will of course need to use the right
100 a suitable obstacle friendly surface
anything glossy or white weren't work
well at all this is where our steel
series qck double XL comes in
I love these food s mouse pads and the
steel series paid to live
at 900 by 400 millimeters it's bigger
than some comparable fool desk pads and
as such the sample size to even the
wildest Mouse play love and I really
enjoy being able to move my keyboard
around without it running into the edge
of my mousepad up top the pad is really
nice simple black colored fabric that's
really quite comfortable to lean against
with a white SteelSeries logo at the
bottom right this material is made to
suit both laser and optical mice and
I've heard that it even works with the
ball mouse if you're still gaming in the
90s a rubbery non-slip base provides
plenty of grip not that sliding around
is really ever an issue with these large
mouse pads and the bottom is patterned
with the SteelSeries logo - all around
it's a great mousepad and it even comes
with some SteelSeries stickers to boot
the SteelSeries Engine 3 is the software
suite that pairs with the rival 100 and
the UI is intuitive simple and tractive
you can remap the buttons as you please
as well as the RGB lighting though
unfortunately if you're someone that
likes to finely tune your DPI you'll
only be able to adjust in 250 dpi
increments the liftoff distance can't be
changed the game is the do lift off
regularly this could be an issue is the
optical sensor will start tracking when
you're within about a centimeter of the
pad and move the cursor slightly not
much of an issue in Windows but it
definitely can be when gaming overall
the SteelSeries rival 100 is a pretty
fantastic budget Gaming Mouse
I liked the inclusion of RGB lighting
and the two rubber group pads on the
sides it gave it a more premium feel it
would have been nice to have a couple
more powerful options in the Engine 3
software but clearly these features are
being reserved for SteelSeries more
expensive models the qck double XL
mousepad is huge and delivers on all
fronts and it's just $40 the rival 100
is one of the best budget gaming mice
available right now thanks for checking
out the SteelSeries rival 100 Gaming
