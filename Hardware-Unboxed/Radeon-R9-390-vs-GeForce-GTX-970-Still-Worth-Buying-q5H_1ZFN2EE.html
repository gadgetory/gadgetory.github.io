actually I'm not even I'm not sure that
I did it all right how's my hair look is
that all right good welcome back to
harbor unbox for a video I promised
about two months ago now normally I'd
like to leave you guys hanging but with
the arrival of Verizon 7 followed by the
GTX 1080i then Rison 5 Verizon 5 and
well more horizon 5 that brings us to
today anyway back in February I
revisited the geforce gtx 970 to see how
the video is hugely popular maxwell base
GPU was getting on in modern titles the
970 has been heavily criticized for the
whole three and a half gigabyte memory
debacle and many claimed it would fall
in a heap before too long making it a
bad buy especially for second-hand
shoppers what I found though was quite
the opposite the 970 proved very capable
at iupi and even the 1440p resolution
out of the box it was on par with the RX
470 though once overclocked we did see a
performance boost of 12% on average
which allowed it to match the our
explore oh you four gigabyte while
falling only slightly short of the gtx
1066 gigabyte in the end I recommended
second-hand shoppers try and find a GTX
970 for around $150 us or say two
hundred and fifty dollars ozzie of
course if you can snag one for less
that's even better
following that video the plan was to
revisit the r9 390 to see how AMD's
counterpart gets on in today's games and
how it compares to the GTX 970 so that's
exactly what we're doing
lined up I have 22 games on the menu
most of which are very recently released
titles and all have been tested at 1080p
and 1440p for comparison we have not
just the GTX 970 but also the gtx 1070
1060 1052 i RX 480 and RX 470 so we
should be able to work on exactly where
the r9 390 slots in today's landscape
for testing I've taken my old hrs Radeon
r9 390 Ice q 2x OC
this card benchmarked in that
out-of-the-box configuration and then
again with a custom overclock
out-of-the-box the card features a core
clock speed of 1020 megahertz which is
an insignificant 2% boost over the AMD
reference clock speeds I was able to
manually raise the clock frequency or
eleven hundred and twenty megahertz
which was a further ten percent
overclock finally by default the gddr5
memory comes clocked at 1500 megahertz
and for our custom overclock I pushes up
to 1700 megahertz for throughput of 6.8
gigabits per second finally all testing
was conducted using our core i7 7700 K
test system overclocked to 4.9 gigahertz
with 32 gigabytes of ddr4 3000 memory
first up we have rising the Tomb Raider
here the r9 390 is able to match the RX
470 and while an 82 FPS average is
certainly very playable that did make it
quite a bit slower than the GTX 970
overclocked it gains an additional 5
frames at least placed it on par with
the RX 480
still even overclocked the r9 390
couldn't catch the GTX 970 in this title
moving to 1440p we find similar margins
though the r9 390 does close in a little
bit on the GTX 970 of course rise of the
Tomb Raider isn't in video sponsored
title and therefore tends to favor the
green team a little bit more
still it's a visually impressive game
it's well worth including and with over
21 other games to look at it's not going
to screw the results by a meaningful
margin interestingly the r9 390 performs
like a champion Far Cry primal leaving
the R X 480 behind and comfortably
beating the GTX 970 that said even
factoring overclocking in the r9 390 has
just enough Headroom is stay ahead of
the overclocked GTX 970 moving to 1440p
the r9 390 remains very strong pushing
48 fps
while the overclocked GTX 970 does fall
away managing just 43 fps it would seem
that the larger memory buffer of the r9
390 is playing to its advantage here
that said though both cards did play
much better at 1080p
the division is a very visually pleasing
game using the ultra quality preset but
even so the r9 390 makes out very well
and once overclocked averaged 58 FPS
at 1080p this made it slightly faster
than the GTX 970
for good measure now 1440p gamers will
want to reduce the quality settings
slightly that's 43 FPS on average with
dips below 30 fps is an ideal the same
will also be true for GTX 970 owners as
you would expect the r9 390 performs
very well in hitman and once overclocked
it came second only to the gtx 1070 as
this is an AMD sponsored title it wasn't
surprising to see the r9 390 crushing
the GTX 970 here we find much the same
story at 1440p here the 390 managed to
average 60fps while the overclocked GTX
970 struggled to average 50 fps quantum
break is in the game AMD fans like to
see included but it's not that old yet
so expect to see it hanging around till
later this year
anyway the r9 390 averaged over 60 FPS
with the game maxed out at a DP so there
isn't much to worry about here not only
that but it managed to stay ahead of the
GTX 970 overclocked to the GTX 970 does
catch up at 1440p though wasn't able to
match the r9 390 once it was overclocked
similar to games such as hitman in the
division you will want to sacrifice
visual quality ever so slightly at this
resolution for smoother frame rates
unsurprisingly the r9 390 handles
overwatch at 1080p with ease delivering
a silky smooth 155 FPS on average and
165 fps once overclocked it might have
been a bit slow on the GTX 970 in this
style but with well over 100 FPS at all
times it hardly matters moving a 1440p
we do see framerate drop as you would
expect
and now the GTX 970 isn't that much
faster than the 390 in fact the minimum
frame rates are very similar indeed like
overwatch we find high frame rates in
Doom as well though this time the r9 390
is ahead quite a bit once overclocking
factored in moving to 1440p again
reduces the frame rate quite a bit and
now the r9 390 and GTX 970 s performance
is fairly similar though the radeon GPU
is of course still faster as you can see
the r9 390 handles total war Warhammer
with relative ease maintaining over 60
FPS at all times in its out-of-the-box
form meanwhile overclocking helped us
squeeze a few more frames out of the
card once again though in terms of
performance it was very similar to the
GTX 970
at our DP River in a 1440p
gives the r9 390 the edge over the GTX
970 though I should emphasize that it's
only a very slight edge with nothing
more than the factory overclocking in
play we set the H is 390 and game with
GTX 970 are neck and neck in Mirror's
Edge catalyst overclocked the 970 does a
little better but the margins are hardly
extreme jumping the 1440p helps out the
r9 390 and its battle against the 970
though once again the margins are very
minor race fans will enjoy slightly ever
so slightly better performance with the
GTX 970 as the r9 390 trails by a few
frames a second at 1080p and much the
same as also found as 1440p still both
graphics cards enabled smooth gameplay
performance in this title using the
maximum in quality game settings the r9
390 did very well in Deus Ex mankind
divided matching the 4 gigabyte 480 out
of the box while I match the a gigabyte
version once overclocked this made it a
good bit faster than the GTX 970 even
with the Maxwell part overclocked of
course mankind divided is an AMD
sponsored title so the findings here are
totally surprising moving a 1440p we
find much the same though no the
graphics cards tested were particularly
impressive in terms of performance using
the very high quality preset pushing
over 60fps at all times in battlefield 1
isn't particularly difficult with modern
mood range hardware which speaks to how
well the games optimize even with the
ultra quality settings in play the r9
390 sped at over 80 FPS on average at
1080p moving to 1440p we still saw an
average of over 60 fps and once
overclocked the r9 390 and GTX 970
delivered very similar performance mafia
3 is still inexplicably demanding using
the high quality preset though the game
does tend to favor hardware from the
green team as a result the GTX 970 was
found to be slightly faster than the r9
390 at 1080p
now 1440p you can forget about the
higher quality settings even a medium
the game is extremely demanding anyway
here we see the 390 and 970 delivering
the same performance the HIAS r9 390 was
good for an average of 77 FPS at 1080p
when playing Gears of War 4 making it a
few frames faster than the game would GT
X 970 overclock the 970 does pull a few
frames ahead so the roles are reversed
jumping to 1440p again plays in favor of
the r9 390 and here we see both previous
generation GPUs render 52 fps on average
which is quite impressive given we using
the ultra quality preset titanfall 2
fans will enjoy the fact that the
previous generation graphics cards are
still able to deliver exceptional
performance in this title the 390 was
also fast in the 970 in both the
out-of-the-box form as well as with the
custom overclock the margins did close
up at 1440p though it was interesting to
note the r9 390 offered exceptional
minimum frame rate performance beating
the 970 by 6 FPS out of the box
granted higher frame rates aren't
necessary will enjoy Civilization 6 but
it's nice to see the r9 390 providing
strong results all the same averaging
over 60 fps at 1080p will ensure smooth
animation in this title as the game is
primarily CPU bound we find only a
slight dip in framerate performance when
jumping from 1080p to 1440p call of duty
infinite warfare is another modern title
it's not particularly demanding though
you could argue that down to the
somewhat dated looking graphics anyway
the 390 was good for at least 73 FPS on
average allowing it to match the GTX 10
63 gigabyte while overclocking put it
within striking distance of the 6
gigabyte model moving to 1440 peter 390
can be seen leading the gtx 970 and the
margin is reasonably large when
comparing the out-of-the-box performance
watchdogs 2 provides similar results
between the factory overclocked gtx 970
and r9 390 both averaging around 55 FPS
at 1080p
this meant custom overclocking gave the
GTX 970 the edge but the margins were
far from extreme now 1440p the
overclocked GTX 970 pulls further ahead
hitting 47 fps to the r9 390 s 41 fps
ideally gamers will want to lower the
quality settings here to achieve frame
rates closer to 60 FPS for those of you
unaware using very high quality settings
makes Resident Evil 7 a massive vram pig
and as a result even at 1080p the r9 390
is able to pull ahead of the gtx 970 or
well ahead out of the box the 390 was
almost 40% faster than the 970
that's a devastating margin right there
increasing the resolution only makes
life harder for the gtx970 as the r9 390
is now 47% faster whereas the r9 39 is
good for at least 66 FPS the 970 can
only muster 45 FPS for those of you who
like to cross swords we have for honor
and here we find not the dingdong battle
between the r9 390 and gtx 970
out of the box the r9 390 was a smidgen
quicker while the 970 pulled a fraction
ahead once overclocked we find much the
same story at 1440p between the 390 and
970 still the 390 looked good
overclocked matching the RX 488 gigabyte
we're getting there people second last
game and its prey here the 390 turned
out an impressive 95 FPS on average
which placed it on par with the gtx 970
moving to 1440p the 390 again matched
the 970 out of the box so i overclocking
did hand in the 970 a rather massive win
over the 390 still both will good for
over 50 fps at all times using the very
high quality settings all right we made
it
dawn of war 3 the last game tested right
so at 1080p the 390 was good 473 FPS on
average which is essentially what we saw
from the 970 once again overclocking
help the 970 snag the leaders at 85 FPS
to the 76 FPS of the overclocked 390 on
the other hand the 1440p resolution once
again helps out the r9 390 allow it to
close in on the overclocked 970 in the
engine average of around 50 FPS is
plenty for smooth player performance in
Dawn of War 3 the power consumption for
the r9 390 isn't as bad as I recall
total system consumption only increased
by 13% over the gtx 970 so really that's
not a big issue at all not only that but
with a high-end overclocked core i7 7700
k cpu the entire system consumed well
under 400 watts when gaming overclocking
the r9 390 did push consumption up to
351 watts for the entire system but even
then that's still very manageable
of course when compared to current
generation GPU such as the gtx 960 or
the RS 480 the r9 390 does look like a
bit of a power Pig alright
whole 23 games and
the bag it felt like for the most part
the r9 390 and GTX 970 were pretty well
neck-and-neck often trading blows
depending on the title but which one
came out on top overall and by how much
well let's go take a look shall we well
out of the box the r9 390 was 7% faster
than the GTX 970 producing on average 80
fps at 1080p and the margin grew to 8
percent at 1440p overclocked to 390
enjoyed a performance boost of just 5%
on average and this was seen at both
tested resolutions meanwhile the GTX 970
did much better through overclocking and
joying on average a 12 percent boost in
performance surprisingly however even
with this massive boost the GTX 970 was
still only able to match the 390 with
both GPUs overclocked what's really
interesting to note is that almost two
years ago back when Matt was presenting
on the channel in this beautiful blue
top we put together a 22 game battle
between the r9 390 and GTX 970 and not a
single game featured back then was
featured in today's video back then we
found both graphics cards to live at
identical performance across the 22
games tested at 1440p in the comparison
we picked the GTX 970 / the r9 390 so
the simple fact that it consumes less
power and overclocked considerably
better as you might imagine we did quite
a bit of flak for picking the GTX 970
mostly because that whole like I said
3.5 gigabyte memory device and at the
time most reviewers were going with the
safer option which was the r9 390 quite
a number of viewers claimed that within
a year the GTX 970 would fall on a heap
as newer more demanding titles were
released allowing the 390 to take charge
and therefore making it a wiser
investment well here we are well over a
year later with 22 new and much more
demanding games and as you've just seen
it's still neck and neck
the r9 390 has made up some ground
though that's not entirely surprising as
a MIDI has made significant strides in
their driver development otherwise known
as fine wine technology
it's a funny spin that anyway
overclocked both graphics cards now
deliver similar performance overall
while the GTX 970 still remains a little
more power efficient so picking between
the two is just as hard in 2000
17 as it was back in 2015
thankfully you don't really need to
worry about which one to get as much
these days I would simply go with the
best second-hand dealer you can find
with out-of-the-box performance similar
to that of the rx 470 or GTX 1060 which
cost around a hundred and seventy
dollars u.s. or two hundred and forty
dollars Australian you won't want to
spend that much on a second-hand GTX 970
or r9 390 given they are secondhand and
that means that there isn't going to be
any kind of warranty couple that with
the fact they do consume more power
I would aim for a maximum purchase price
of one hundred and fifty dollars u.s. or
around two hundred dollars Ozzie it
might be hard to find these graphics
cards for those prices though is they
have held their value very well that's
probably because of the performance just
seen that said though I recommend you
look to spend about a hundred and twenty
dollars u.s. or 180 dollars Ozzie at
those prices you will be getting a
really good deal well that's going to do
it for this one hope you guys enjoyed
the comparison and I'm keen to see how
these two GPUs compare in another year
or so for pricing please check the links
