are checking out GPU performance in
battlefield 5 the official release
version of the game because if you're a
call back in early September we did give
the beta version of the game a well and
found some pretty solid performance from
both AMD and NVIDIA the only problem was
back then we could only benchmark using
the multiplayer portion of the game and
that does make gathering accurate and
reliable data quite difficult for
testing a single hardware configuration
the multiplayer portion of the game is
actually quite useful as it's very
taxing and it will give you a good idea
of how certain setup will handle the
game but directly comparing that data
with the second system is very difficult
and extremely time consuming to do
accurately the margin of error also
becomes very large therefore comparing
half a dozen or more hardware
configurations isn't really a viable
option using the multiplayer portion of
the game therefore for this test I'm
using the single-player campaign and
since we're looking at GPU performance
for now this shouldn't really be an
issue what has allowed me to do is
benchmark 38 new and previous generation
GPUs from both AMD and NVIDIA I've
selected operation Dragoon for this
benchmark session and the test starts at
the checkpoint where the objective is to
destroy the anti-air positions and the
test runs for 60 seconds I begin by
taking a few shots with a sniper rifle
and then moving left and taking a path
up the left side of the base and from
there I take a few more shots and then
continue to move along the edge of the
base the results shown here have been
taken from an average of three runs
testing takes place at 1080p 1440p and
4k using the ultra quality preset with
DirectX 11 we found earlier during the
game's beta phase that D X 12 causes
frame time issues leading to very
noticeable stuttering and unfortunately
this appears to still be the case so
that's terrible news for anyone wanting
to take advantage of the yet to be
included rate racing technology for this
benchmark I'll be using my updated GPU
test rig which is built inside the
corsair crystal 570 EXA comprises of a
kora 999 hurricane clocked at 5
gigahertz with 16 gigabytes of ddr4 3400
memory
the GeForce GPUs driver version for 1681
was used and for AMD the Radeon
adrenaline 18 11.1 driver okay so I
think that's about everything let's get
into the results starting with the
previous generation GPUs we find for an
average of 60 fps at 1080p you'll need
either a Radeon r9 390 or GeForce GTX
970 graphics card if you want to keep
frame rates above 60 fps at all times
the r9 390x or gtx 980 will be required
and interesting that we are seeing a
very even performance between the older
AMD and NVIDIA GPUs in battlefield 5 in
fact I have to say the Maxwell
optimization seemed a bit better than
what we've been seeing in other recently
released games so that's great to see
jumping up to 1440p and we find a very
console --is-- 30 FPS for the gtx 960
and r9 380 the r9 390 and GTX 970 are
about as slow as I'd consider going here
and even then I'd probably drop the
quality preset down to a high at 1440p
for a much smoother experience you will
require a fury or gtx 980ti GPU oddly
our nano graphics card which shouldn't
be that much slower than the fury was
performing quite strangely in
battlefield 5 and it can be much slower
than expected so I'll have to
double-check these results as soon as I
can but for now unfortunately I am
locked out of battlefield 5 on every
Origin account I have access to due to
excessive hardware changes so cheers for
that EA moving on we have the 4k results
unsurprisingly the flagship GPUs from
2014 and 2015 I really aren't cutting it
here at least not with the ultra quality
preset enabled so let's move on a check
out some much newer GPUs ok so please
note I'm not including the Radeon rx 400
series GPUs as for the most part they've
just been rebranded to the rx 500 series
so for an average of 60 FPS you'll want
a GTX 1063 gigabyte or rx 570 both did
very well at 1080p that said with the RX
570 selling for as little as 150 dollars
u.s. right now that would be my go to
budget option for battlefield 5 right
now then for those that want to keep
frame rates above 60 fps at all
the GeForce GTX 1066 gigabyte or Radeon
rx 580 will do the trick nicely beyond
that we are starting to get into I
suppose what you could call overkill
territory for a lot of gamers that said
I'd be targeting something like the GTX
1080 or RTX 2070 or perhaps even Vega 64
for 1080p higher refresh rate
battlefield 5 action then at 1440p
you're really going to need at least the
six gigabyte 1060 or an Rx 580 and in
fact the radeon GPU looks to be the
preferred option here as it delivered
16% more performance we also see vega 56
beating the gtx 1070 by 9 percent margin
while vega 64 matched the gtx 1080 and
our TX 2070 still if you want big frame
rates then you can't go past the r-tx
2080 or gtx 1080i and then of course
there is the absolutely insane
RTX 20 80 TI the GTX 1080 TI and r-tx 20
80 also do quite well at 4k but this is
really where the artex 20 80 TI comes
into its own delivering well over 60 FPS
at all times making for a breathtaking
4k gaming experience I've said it before
and I'll say it again the r-tx 2080 TI
is really something else for 4k gaming
admittedly it is a stupidly expensive
GPU but it's the only r-tx model that
makes an ounce of sense in my opinion
given that it can enable an experience
that's seen by no other GPU then tossing
all 38 GPUs together gives us this micro
font graph the r-tx 2080 TI is still a
big stand out though even at 1080p
anyway if you want to examine this graph
in a bit more detail and feel free to
pause the video as I'm just gonna skip
through these graphs that include all
the results and here we can see the
1440p numbers and please note any GPU
that couldn't push over 20 FPS was
dropped as the results are somewhat
useless then finally we have the 4k
results and again any GPU that couldn't
average at least 20 FPS was dropped from
the testing for this resolution capping
off the testing I've got some quality
scaling performance with the GTX 1066
yearbut and rx 588 gigabyte dropping
down from ultra low high boost
performance of the RX 580 by 22% while
we see a slow
large of 25% gain for the gtx 1060 then
from high to medium sees a massive 33%
boost for the gtx 1060 and 34% for the
RX 580 and at this point there isn't
much need to seek out the low quality
preset all right so normally I also test
about a dozen really old GPUs at 1080p
using the medium quality preset and I'll
do this to give those of you running
older hardware a good idea of what to
expect
unfortunately I've not been able to
include that data this time due to a
EA's ridiculous hardware limitations
I've talked about this before but EA has
this stupid activation limit that
doesn't allow for more than 5 hardware
changes for a typical game of this
really isn't an issue so I guess fair
enough but for those of us testing the
game to show you how it performs it
really is a big problem basically after
testing 5 GPUs the account gets locked
out for 24 hours and sometimes I've
found as little as 3 hardware changes
will trigger this lockout so it means we
have to purchase multiple copies of the
game in this case pay a month's worth of
EA Origin access premier on multiple
accounts on that note I would like to
just take a moment to thank the Patriots
who sacrifice their accounts for the
good of the benchmarks very much
appreciate that you guys really are the
lifeblood of the channel I will continue
to test more configurations over the
coming days and I also want to work out
what's going on with my new narrow
graphics cards so expect some updates on
that and then of course we will
transition into quite a bit of CPU
testing as I know you guys always want
to see some CPU benchmarks for now I can
conclude that those of you wanting to
play battlefield 5 at 60fps and all of
its glories that is to say using the
ultra quality preset and you want a game
at repe then you really need nothing
more than a GTX 970 three gigabyte 1060
the r9 390 or even the RX 570 that card
is particularly good value right now and
then for those of you wanting to play at
1440p the fury fury x not sure what was
going on with the nano there but the
fury in fury x definitely worked well as
did the RX 580 the gtx 980ti and the gtx
1066 gigabyte at about what you'll
require for yes
60 FPS on average honestly though given
how great the game looks I don't feel
like that's a very tall order at all
we've seen games that look much worse
than battlefield 5 and had required
things like you know a gtx 1070 or vega
56 for example that said we are talking
about the direct x11 performance the
direct x12 implementation still appears
to be a bit buggy which is what we saw
in the be nuts actually what we saw with
battlefield 1 and it didn't really get
fixed that well as the game went on
there was still some odd stuff there
throughout decks 12 so that is a bit
concerning for those of you hoping to
take advantage of rate racing in this
title
whenever rate racing is supported by
this title and on that note I am going
to end this one sorry again that the
testing wasn't up to our usual standard
yeah
hasn't really made it easy for us
unfortunately with that five hardware
limitation business if anyone watching
this video
knows anyone at EA that could help us
out with removing that from our account
because apparently for certain media
outlets and testing and that some people
claim it you can remove from the account
I haven't actually got proper
confirmation about that but I've tried
to contact EA and you haven't got too
far yet but if anyone knows anyone AAA
or anyone from watching this video by
chance and you can help us out please
contact just because yeah it would make
doing this testing a hell of a lot
easier for you weren't limited to five
Hardware changes per account it's a bit
of a nightmare
anyway I hope you still enjoyed the
video remember to subscribe for more
content and if you appreciate the way we
do our box then can see it up supporting
us on patreon thank you for watching I'm
your host Steve see you next time
