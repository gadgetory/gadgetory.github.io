have a bit of an odd release to cover
Intel's new Zed 390 chipset there's
nothing particularly odd about the
chipset itself or the motherboards that
it's featured on though MSI's godlike is
a little bit outrageous what's odd is
that today we can talk about these new
boards we can show them off to you and
really there's nothing that we can't
show you in regards to the boards but
what we can't do is test them with a new
9th gen processor and in my opinion that
kind of defeats the purpose of showing
you these boards at all really the
entire point of these new Z 390
motherboards other than to give
motherboard manufacturers an excuse to
create a new range of motherboards is to
fully support or ensure full support for
the new 8 core processors such as the
core I 999 okay as they will suck quite
a bit of power so you want to make sure
that you have a very beefy vrm but we'll
get to that in a moment
existing is ed 370 boards will still
support the 1900 K so there's full
backwards compatibility there are
forwards compatibility with the eighth
and ninth gen series but many of the
cheaper boards were designed around
these six core 8700 K and therefore may
could possibly not I percent sure yet
v√©ra vrm throttle with the 9900 k
particularly if you plan to overclock so
yeah that's something we will
investigate in a later video we
obviously aren't allowed to test it now
because we can't do any 9,900 K testing
at all nothing not even for testing of
air and thermal so bit disappointing and
it's got me scratching my head as to
what we're doing for this release so
that means it'll be another week and a
half before we can properly test these
390 motherboards with a ninth gen
processor and of course at that time we
will probably shift our focus towards
the ninth gen Pro so we will test them
on these boards but these boards won't
be the focus of our day one coverage in
a week and a half but we will follow up
with some vrm temperature testing
overclocking and all the usual stuff we
do with motherboards my initial plan was
to get that out of the way today since
the boards are being released
day but all that juicy vrm thermal and
overclocking stuff will have to wait
till we can show you the night okay so
yeah that's a bit disappointing but
there's the rules what we're allowed to
do today is show you an easy 390
advertising and press materials do an
unboxing review and all live demo with
an 8th gen process up as many of you
know I quite enjoy getting the chance to
unbox the latest and greatest tech a few
days ahead of the release to show you
what we're working on and give you just
a little bit of insight basically it's
fun and I get to give you a heads up
that all those juicy benchmarks are just
around the corner but for this one we
aren't going to be unboxing the main
event the new 9th gen processors in fact
I don't really have that much
information about these new processes to
give you some reviewers may have more
information but right now we don't
actually have a contact at Intel at all
so yeah all the information I've got has
come directly from the motherboard
vendors but what I'm hearing is about
the time this video goes live Intel will
be doing a live stream where that will
be possibly taking pre-orders for the
9th to end processes of course we always
recommend you don't pre-order but you
will be at at least acquire the MSRP s
for all these chips so that pricing is
useful information unfortunately I don't
have it right now but maybe at the time
of me saying this as you watch it you
will know what the prices of these
processes are so future Steve will have
more information that he won't be giving
you in this video so in the absence of
any real testing or at least testing
that would be useful that is testing
with a 1900 K not the 8700 K what I've
decided to do is tell you as much as I
can about the Zed 390 chipset which
admittedly isn't a whole lot the 9th gen
core series processors we have some
useful information there such as core
count which we're already pretty well
aware of and clock speeds and stuff at
least I have the official information
that I can release other Zed 390
motherboards we have a couple of those
on hand the one board but well a
flagship board from asrock and a
flagship board from msi so we'll go over
those towards the end of the video but
for now I'll give you some information
regarding the core i9 1900 k the core i7
9700 okay
the core i5 9600 K all of which part of
the coffee like refresh the core I 999
hundred K is an 8 core processor with
hyper-threading enabled for 16 threads
it operates at a base frequency of 3.6
gigahertz but will boost as high as 4.7
gigahertz and all caused with a maximum
single core frequency of 5 gigahertz the
l3 cache has been increased from the 87
our case 12 megabyte capacity up to 16
megabytes and quite shockingly despite
packing two extra cores and 4 megabytes
more cache the TDP rating remains the
same at 95 watts which was already
suspiciously low for the ID 700 K
granted the TDP is measured from the
base frequency but the 99 K is only
clocked 3% low while packing 33% more
cause obviously this is going to be one
power-hungry hot little item an
indication of this is the fact that
Intel's now soldering these chips rather
than using thermal paste as they have in
the past at least as far back as 2011
the core i7 9700 K is also an 8 core
processor but it lacks hypotonia support
meaning it only packs 8 threads it comes
clocked at these same 3.6 gigahertz base
frequency while the all core and single
core clock speeds have been devalued by
100 megahertz and the l3 cache capacity
down to 12 megabytes then finally we
have the core i5 9600 ka 6 core 6
threaded part and this is basically a
rebadged Core i5 8600 k with a 100
megahertz increase in frequency so all
ninth gen parts revealed so far a
soldered feature official support for
ddr4 2666 memory and pack a 95 watt TDP
rating though the 9700 km 9900 K are the
only truly new CPUs in this series given
that these new 9th gens use the same
coffee-like architecture on the 40
nanometer process we have a pretty good
idea of what to expect in terms of
performance power consumption and
overclocking Headroom FSI suggests in
their press material that 5 gigahertz
should be a typical overclock for an
onliner ok but oddly in their game boost
slide advertised 5.4 gigahertz for the
base and 5.7 gigahertz as the single
core clock speed
and they advertise this as being
possible a turn of a dial I don't doubt
that this is what the mode 11 tries to
achieve but without insane voltages and
exotic cooling I can't imagine this
being remotely achievable but anyway I
guess we'll find out soon my 8700 K is
considered to be a golden sample and it
can only do five point three gigahertz
on the very best is there 370
motherboards actually used the godlike
version there's at 317 God life for a
lot of my five point three gigahertz
testing so yeah I'm not expecting too
many of the eight core models hit five
point four G Hertz but I guess we will
know what it's capable of before too
long then we see in the same slide that
they're advertising an all core maximum
or core frequency of five point three
gigahertz for the 9700 K and five
gigahertz for the 9600 K so yeah that's
quite interesting moving on we have the
Zed 390 chipset which like most chipsets
these days is a bit unnecessary when
compared to these ed 370 chipset Zed 390
brings native support for up to half a
dozen USB 3.1 gen2 ports and cnv I
support the native USB 3.1 gen2 support
means that 390 motherboards should
support more of those ports most of the
higher ends at 370 boards only offered
to 3.1 gen2 ports using a third-party
controller as force ENVI support it was
the H 370 chipset that was first to
employ Intel integrated connectivity or
CN VI technology for whilst networking
in short this technology moves the bulk
of the wireless module into the chipset
this means the m2 module only needs to
have some very basic stuff along with
the antenna making Wi-Fi a much cheaper
add-in product anyway neither feature is
really a game changer and I'm certain
most of you can do with the various
versions offered by these at 370
motherboards the real reason we have
this new chipset is to signify that all
Zed 390 motherboards will be up to the
task of extracting maximum performance
from the core o 999 or ok so that is to
say they all pack a sufficiently beefy
vrm I don't expect we'll see any Zed 390
motherboards with anything less than a
true six phase of erm having said all
that if you do have a high-end
said 370 bored then you shouldn't have
any trouble getting the most other than
you eight core models even if you plan
on overclocking so all eighth and ninth
gen core processors will work on these
same motherboards that regardless of
whether they sport a Zed 370z 390 h3 7tb
360 or even the h3 10 chipset I have to
admit I chuckled a little bit when I
went over this particular slider for MSI
is showing continued compatibility the
part where they state due to the
limitation by bias and ME coffee light
refresh CPUs will only be compatible
with Zed 390 and other 300 series
motherboards and will not work with 100
and 200 series motherboards we've talked
about this before and how Intel could
open up support for the eighth and now
ninth gen CPUs on the 100 and 200 series
boards while the 300 series boards could
support these 6th and 7th gen core
processors but Intel refuses to allow it
anyway I just found that a little
humorous that arrow size basically
saying Intel's limiting support and all
it would take is a few minor software
updates and they could make their
platform significantly more
consumer-friendly
now for those of you who missed it we
heard a similar thing from Andrew were
the asou sprite manager I believe that
was last year shortly after the 8th gen
series was first released so yeah not a
lot to talk about when it comes to these
ed 390 chips though itself so we might
as well take a quick look at a few of
the more insane as ed 390 motherboards
for the sneak peak we have 2 flagship
models the msi meg z 390 god-like and
the asrock z 390 Taichi ultimate like
these ed 370 godlike this new version is
another limited edition type deal so if
you want to get your hands on what I
suspect will be the most extreme Zed 390
motherboard on the market then you'd
best not mess about that's at a slightly
cut down and arguably much more sensible
version known as the magazine 390 ace
will be available for the life of the
platform the highlights of the godlike
model include a 16 phase V core verum
jewel killer a 2500 Gigabit LAN
streaming boost PCIe card and support
for 5 m2 SSDs out of the box for those
wondering the ACE version has been
downgraded to
what's still a rather over killed 12
phase vrm and the m-dot to expand
account has been removed from the
package most of the onboard features
there are quite similar the V Corvair
and configuration of the godlike has
basically been lifted from the Meg
external creation so that's obviously a
pretty good thing this means it's a
genuine 16 phase V core very amusing the
ir35 2:01 controller which supports up
to eight phases each phase is doubled
using the ir35 99 phase w which connects
to a pair of Infineon TDA 21 for seven
to power stages for two separate phases
these are 70 amp power stages so the
godlike is extreme overkill with a peak
current capacity of 1120 amps then from
asrock the king of their Hill is the Zed
390 Taichi ultimate and this board packs
all the latest bells and whistles as
well as rocks gone with a 12 phase V
core verum which should provide the no
hurricane with more than enough power
even went overclocked to the max as
rocks also gone all that with the
networking by including dual Intel
Gigabit LAN along with a single 10
Gigabit LAN connection they've also
included Intel dual band 802 11 AC Wi-Fi
supporting up to 1.7 3 gigabits per
second of throughput along with
Bluetooth 5.0 as for the vcore verum
configuration we have an IR 3 5 2 0 1
controller connected to 6 ir 3 5 9 8 SS
which connect to a dozen TI 8 7 3 5 0 D
power stage is rated for a maximum
current capacity of 40 amps but will
deliver 25 amps at 90% efficiency that
means up to 300 amps can be delivered at
90% efficiency with a peak load of 480
amps interestingly neither the godlike
nor the Taichi ultimate feature proper
finned heat sinks and while this is much
less of an issue for the god like the
Taichi ultimate will probably also run
at reasonable temperatures with the no
her ok overclocked to say 5 gigahertz of
course we can't release any real testing
until the 19th I think it's fair to
assume that Z 390 boards are going to
cost more than sort of your mid-range
said 370 boards and that the 1900 kr 97
are ok are going to cost quite a bit
more than in previous
a flagship mainstream desktop CPUs so
it'll be interesting to see how they
compare to AMD's rise in 720 700 X on a
be 450 motherboard anyway that is going
to do it for now I'm again very sorry I
couldn't bring you vrm thermal
performance of I've got about half a
dozen zeb 390 boards on hand right now
that I would like to test but we had a
look at these two more extreme boards
anyway yeah
bit disappointing I'm just as
disappointed as you guys that I couldn't
spend many many hours testing these
boards with the 1900 K but that testing
will still happen we just have to wait a
bit longer
