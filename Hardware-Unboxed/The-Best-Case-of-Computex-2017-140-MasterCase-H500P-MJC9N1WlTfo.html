Computex coverage and this time I
managed to get within shooting distance
of the new cooler master H 500 P and
cosmos C 700 P all week the coolermaster
boots has been packed and even on Friday
I still had a hard time getting some
good shots
thanks to MSA for bringing me to
Computex 2017 this year if you're in the
market for a new gaming desktop PC then
check out msi high-end core i7 systems
also right now they are offering a free
you play game key for Tom Clancy's Ghost
Recon wildlands with select purchases
it's also possible to score wildlands
game code with select msi motherboards
check out their new x99 z - 7 th - 70
range i'll provide a link in the video
description so finally I had my chance
to check out the new Coolermaster
products before making my way to the
epic cases I paid a visit to the
peripheral section of the booth and here
I found quite a few new upcoming
products on display was a nice new
looking mouse and keyboard combo the
master set ms 120 the keyboard features
the mem chemical tactile switches and
the mouse has pro grade switches with
on-the-fly dpi switching of course both
are RGB lit and as you can see they're
very eye-catching also on display was a
new gaming headset the master pulse MH
320 the headset features a steel frame
construction and Coolermaster says it's
built to last
it also has ultra soft leather ear cups
I have to say they felt great and they
should remain comfortable for long
gaming sessions Coolermaster also says
the boom mic is bi-directional so
background noise shouldn't be an issue
but obviously I wasn't able to test that
on the showroom floor
as there was probably just a bit too
much background noise as I understand it
this is meant to be a reasonably
affordable headset and is backed by a
two-year warranty also in coming our two
new gaming mice spec wise they are both
the same using a picsArt pmw 3360
infrared sensor with adjustable dpi
switching up to 12,000 dpi it also
includes 0 negative acceleration or
prediction for true one-to-one input the
mm 530 is designed for those who like a
palm grip while the mm 5
20 is for claw grip users the peripheral
that I was most interested in was the
master keys mk7 50 and this keyboard
uses Cherry MX which is it boasts a
minimalist type design while still
looking quite flashy thanks to an RGB
light bar okay now it's time for the big
boys here we have the cosmos see 700 P
and what a beast this thing is the
cosmos series has always included big
beefy cases and the C 700 P is no
exception measuring six hundred and
forty millimeters tall six hundred and
forty millimeters deep and 305
millimeters wide design wise this in my
opinion is the best-looking cosmos case
yet the aluminium handles and feet look
amazing as does the curved tempered
glass that's right this case has curved
glass hiding behind the aluminium
trimmings is some subtle RGB lighting
and again this looks great the i/o panel
also features some nice RGB highlights
speaking of which you will find a USB
3.1 gen2 type-c port for USB 3.0 ports
and a fan controller internally the case
can accommodate two five and a quarter
inch devices eight three and a half inch
drives and two two and a half inch
drives something I found a bit
disappointing though is the fact that
the case only comes with a single 140
millimeter fan pre-installed so that's a
big surprise for such a premium case
moving on to what is absolutely my
favorite case of the entire show the new
master case H 500 P the latest
installment 1/2 or high airflow series
this is without question one of the most
unique looking computer cases I've seen
in a very long time not only does it
look very unique but it also looks very
good the design manages to be aggressive
but also simplistic and elegant at the
same time it has a nice big tempered
glass side panel and RGB LED lighting
helps give it some Flair as well crammed
into the front of the case are two huge
200 millimeter fans which are again RGB
lit these fans force a huge amount of
air through the case and I really like
how they're visible through the front
window Coolermaster has done a good job
of showing off these fans without
inhibiting their ability to work
efficiently a clean bill can easily be
achieved with the help of a two-part PSU
cover and several additional covers at
the front and back side of the
motherboard tray
what's really exciting about this new
case is the price the H 500 P should be
available in September of this year and
it should retail for an unbelievable 140
dollars u.s. Coolermaster had a heap of
other gear on display the heat column
concept cooler was interesting this
reminds me of something we would have
seen back in the early days of custom
air coolers still it did look good so
I'm keen to see how it performs another
interesting concept cooler on display
was the master air maker 3d Alvie this
was a massive vehicle of packing two
banks of aluminium fins and three 120
millimeter fans Coolermaster also had a
section of the booth which took you for
a nice walk down memory lane back in
1999 they released the CH v 5k 11 so
product names were no better back then
the world's first CPU cooler today
advantage of heat pipe technology then
we have the ATC 100 which was the
world's first all aluminium case
released back in 2000 and what a blast
from the past was seeing this thing
again cool last was busy back in 2004
bringing us the first all-in-one liquid
cooler as well as the CM stacker
featuring removable parts then in 2005
the world's first laptop cooler the cool
pad 2005 also marked the arrival of the
real power 550 watt power supply which
included a display for showing real-time
readout for power consumption the u 2007
was a big one for Coolermaster as this
was when they release to the extremely
well-known 212 then in 2011 they started
making premium gaming keyboards with the
release of the trigger 2013 the v8 GTS
is still fresh in my mind and
Coolermaster says this is when CPU
coolers went from ugly to a centerpiece
of the bills
finally on hand at the booth
coolermaster had some models working
very hard to create some amazing looking
rigs so I'll wrap up the coverage here
and take it out with some shots of all
the awesome systems on display I'm your
host Steve Stig and soon guys
