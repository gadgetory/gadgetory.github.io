taking a further look at the
overclocking performance of intel's new
too hot to handle core I know 7900 X and
with a little tinkering and a lot more
cooling things that are much improved
for those of you who missed it I checked
out three of the upcoming skylake X
chips last week the most powerful of
which is the 700 X a10 core 20 thread
beast in terms of performance the 1700 X
was mighty impressive sadly though it
was severely let down by poor thermals
even when using a premium all-in-one
liquid cooler there are two reasons why
thermals were so bad first and probably
foremost is the fact that Intel still
thinks they can get away by cheeping out
on their high-end customers by using a
rubbish thermal interface material
rather than soldering the chips like AMD
does I'll touch on this a bit more later
in the video the other reason the semi
100x sees temperatures reach boiling
point is due to the extreme power
requirements particularly once the
unlocked chip has been overclocked
out of the box it has no trouble pushing
system consumption well over 200 watts
hitting 260 watts in the Cinebench test
whereas aim DS rise in 7 1800 X maxed
out of 196 watts however it was once
overclocked the consumption really glad
at hand and it was nothing short of
extreme hitting 402 watts under load at
4.6 jiggets using just 1.2 volts
I should note again because obviously I
didn't make it clear enough in the
previous video for now CPU Z is
reporting voltages for the 700 X
incorrectly on my asrock board the chip
isn't running at 1.7 to 1.8 volts that
is the input voltage CPU Z isn't
reporting the fiv R or fully integrated
voltage regulator so to show correct
live voltage reporting this time I will
be using HW info or hardware info for
those using something like course as
hydro series H 100 IV to extreme eeping
the 700 x from throttling at this
frequency simply isn't going to be
possible begin stint the CPU is placed
under any kind of load the temperatures
skyrocketed to 90 degrees and will
continue to climb from there and
eventually the chip would start to
throttle the performance though was
impressive a 10 core 23 chip running all
cause at 4.6 gigahertz is enough
sort of insane and if you can keep
temperatures down I see no reason why
this wouldn't run at four point seven or
even four point eight gigahertz so in an
effort to do adjust that I put together
a brand new test rig with an upgraded
cooling solution using thermal tech
specific RL 360 liquid cooling kit for
those wondering the kit cost three
hundred eighty dollars u.s. or about
five hundred fifty dollars Ozzy and it
comes packing a mammoth three hundred
and sixty millimeter radiator that
measures sixty four millimeters thick so
it's a big boy you also get the Pacific
PR twenty two dash D fire pump offering
a maximum flow rate of 1135 liters per
hour and of course three 120 millimeter
fans I was interested to see just how
much this would help and if it would be
enough to keep the overclock 70 100x in
check finally topping it all off is the
primer chill praxis wet bench and this
was sent over to me by the guys at ple
computers so I big thanks to them and if
any other Australians are keen on buying
one of these I'll provide a link in the
video description ok so moving on to the
testing I should know it's winter here
in Victoria at the moment so my room
temperature was around 19 or 20 degrees
so a few degrees cooler than normal once
the system warmed up idle temps at at
just 26 degrees so that was very good
however of course it is the load temps
that are the real concern previously I
was only able to stabilize the 70 100 X
at 4.6 Q Hertz though I should point out
that for a 10 core processor 4.6
gigahertz is very respectable anyway now
with the added cooling 4.7 gigahertz
wasn't a problem
and I imagine 4.8 gigahertz looks to be
possible with a little bit more voltage
tuning for now that I'm going to test it
4.7 gigahertz because this only required
the same 1.2 volts which is quite low
and this saw the CPU spike to just 60
degrees as soon as it was placed under
load much better than the 87 degree seen
previously even so though I was
expecting temperatures to climb quite
rapidly heading towards the 90s like
they did with the all-in-one cooler but
to my surprise they didn't at least not
to the extent I had anticipated
before long the temps were in the mid
sixties and that eventually hits 70
degrees but after that they slowed right
down maxing out at 73 degrees
occasionally peaking at about 74 degrees
for a second or so before returning to
73 degrees with temperatures now staying
well within acceptable
manners there's no risk of throttling
and thermal takes 120 millimeter fans
remained very quiet as a result power
consumption was also reduced by 7% down
from 402 Watts seen previously at 4.6
gigahertz with the only one liquid
cooler to a slightly more manageable 375
watts granted that still makes the 70
100x super power hungry but it is a much
better result for the 10 core CPU and it
is now running at 4.7 gigahertz the
overclock boosted the Cinebench r15
multi-threaded score by 15% producing an
impressive 2521 points again a 15%
increase in performance can be seen this
time when testing were 7-zip as the 7900
X at 4.7 gigahertz manages an impressive
67,000 747 MIPS when decompressing the
blender workload was completed in just
14.5 seconds previously this test took
seventeen point nine seconds so that's a
very impressive 19% time reduction the
corona test was completed in a
blistering fast 82 seconds previously
this test took 97 seconds so that was
another 15 percent reduction in render
time don't blink the Excel tests was all
said and done in just 1 point 6 9
seconds that's almost half the time it
takes for a stock 7700 to a so with the
right cooling solution like the one we
have here bokura 9 7 100x can be managed
in the results are rather spectacular
granted the power consumption is still
pretty hideous though but I mean you've
got to keep in mind this is a 10 core 20
thread CPU and it is running all cores
at four point seven gigahertz which is
pretty phenomenal so in a way I think
the power consumption can be justified
the main sticking point though that is a
bit harder to justify that $1,000 us
asking price and that is again just for
the CPU that doesn't factor in the
expensive X 299 motherboard and of
course the custom liquid cooling so I
think overall the package is still a bit
of a tough sell realistically you will
want to spend at least $300 us on the
motherboard and it looks like about $300
us on the cooling for a custom
do-it-yourself liquid cooling solution
like what we've done here with
thermaltake so
the package deal for those core
components will be $1,600 us or at least
$1600 u.s. in my opinion and that
doesn't factor in a higher quality power
supply which will also be required and
so on and so forth so a very expensive
platform from Intel here and that sort
of makes me wonder it really will be
interesting to see what thread Ripper
can offer with all its core components
for a similar level of performance so
that's something exciting that we'll be
able to look at shortly talking of the
thermals and the cost of cooling and all
that sort of stuff there is the argument
that you could deal with this 7 100x and
that will reduce low temperatures by at
least 20 degrees that's what we saw with
a much smaller 7700 k chip so I expect
you'll see at least those results here
with a much bigger chip but I'm of the
opinion that you really shouldn't need
to delete your CPU to get the most out
of it particularly to such an expensive
high-end enthusiast grade CPU so I won't
be deleting any of the correct CPUs I
have or at least I don't plan to you
guys will probably force me into
creating a video and showing you the
results but it's not something I really
want to advertise or promote I just
don't think when spending that kind of
money on a CPU should get a rubbish Tim
it should be something quite good it
should be sold basically like what AMD
do but anyway I won't rant and rave
about that I just don't think that
deleting is something that should be
used an excuse for solving a problem
Intel is put forward to enthuse this
it's not something I think you'll want
to do anyway because it does void your
warranty and it is quite risky if you
especially if you know experienced I
don't think you want to attempt your
first deal lid on a 70 900 X for example
so yeah not something I think most will
want to do or should have to do for that
matter but back in February I did bite
the bullet and I did D lead one of my
7700 K chips after suffering terrible
thermal performance when overclocking
and I found that the deal II did reduce
load temperatures by an incredible 20
degrees or thereabout so it was worth it
if you're a serious overclock I suppose
anyway I summarized that video by saying
this I have to say this is really poor
form from Intel doing this to their
unlocked processors if it wasn't already
a low enough blow that Intel we're
charging a premium for their unlocked
processors they're now doing so we're
providing the same rubbish thermal
interface material that they use on the
locked models as a PC enthusiast and a
consumer I really can't stand this and
the need for AMD to deliver next month
is more important than ever all up I
spent 14 dollars on the D lid tool which
I grabbed off eBay $45 on the liquid Pro
and then of course you still need a CPU
cooler for the unlocked Intel processors
they don't come with one and so I used
this Corsair model here and that's about
150 dollars by the way all these prices
are an Australian dollars that I'm
quoting so Intel is stinging overclocked
is about a $40 premium for their
unlocked for i7 and then you need to buy
a cooler and spend about another $60 or
so so you can actually have clock it
without risk of it cooking itself so my
opinion on the matter that is having a
dealer Intel CPU so I haven't clocked
them to the max and do it with
reasonable thermals hasn't changed and
as far as I'm concerned with the 1700 X
the chips are good for somewhere between
four point six and four point eight
yogurts depending on how lucky you get
with the chip itself and how good your
cooling setup is needless to say the
cooling has to be mighty good I've had a
heap of fun overclocking the core I nine
7900 X with thermal takes RL 360 or
liquid cooling kit it's a really good
looking kit and yeah the temperatures
are now acceptable in my opinion the
results were incredible and yeah it's
just been it's been a heap of fun sadly
though using an all-in-one liquid cooler
quite a premium cooler I might add which
I did in my previous video the
experience was met with high temps
throttling issues and overall it was
just it was pretty miserable if I'm
honest as I said at the end of my core X
coverage last week my advice wait until
thread ripper before making any major
cpu purchases still if you dead set on
picking up a 10 core 23 core i 9 7900 X
be prepared to invest in a custom liquid
cooled solution if you plan to overclock
