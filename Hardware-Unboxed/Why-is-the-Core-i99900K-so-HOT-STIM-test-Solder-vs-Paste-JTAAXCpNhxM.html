yesterday we finally got to show you
what the new Intel Core I nine ninety
nine hundred K and core i7 ninety seven
hundred K processors have to offer in
summary the ninety nine hundred K was
fast but not really fussed enough to
justify the price and that now appears
to be the general consensus among
reviewers along with the high price the
other major issue was the high
temperatures again most reviewers were
reporting very high stock temperatures
using high-end coolers and that
basically killed limited hurt the
overclocking performance of these new
chips in my review I spent quite a bit
of time talking about these shockingly
high thermals I expected that the night
a hurricane was going to be a seriously
power-hungry CPU and therefore it would
be a rather hot item I just didn't
expect Intel's first soldered chip in a
very long time to run quite as hot as it
did using relatively low voltages at
five gigahertz or the 9900 k peak at 100
degrees with the coarser hydro series H
100 I Pro RGB or Noctua NHD 15 and we're
talking about some pretty premium
coolers here this was actually worse
than what we saw previously with the
8700 K at 5.2 gigahertz granted the 9900
k-pax 33% more cause but it's soldered
whereas daily similar k uses Intel's
notoriously rubbish thermal paste in the
past I've deleted the 7700 k and 8700
chips with pretty amazing results using
liquid metal drop temperatures at least
20 degrees there a big part of that
improvement was achieved by removing the
IHS glue which reduces the gap between
the CPU die and the heat spreader still
we know that Seoul during CPUs works a
lot better than the pace method that
Intel's been using to save on production
costs fears now we know this because
Intel's desktop CPUs ran much cooler
back when they were sold in 2011 and
that was the Sandy Bridge days for the
mainstream desktop processors and then
the high-end parts were soldered right
up tool Broadwell II in 2016 as a quick
example the chorus
3770k running at 4.7 gigahertz using
1.35 volts would peak at just over 90
degrees running an Ida 64 stress test
and that was with a large sort of tower
style air cooler under almost the exact
same conditions but with one point 4
volts so a bit more voltage the 2600 K
around at least 20 degrees cooler so
that being the case I was expecting the
1900 be something special and not the
kind of special that it turned out to be
anyway what I wanted to know was how
much better is the soldered method used
by the 99er okay than the paste of the
8700 K or 8086 k as they're essentially
the same CPU and I will be using the
8086 K for my testing as I just had that
CPU laying around the 87 okay is busy in
my GPU test rig anyway to find out I
disabled to 1900 K cores which
effectively turns it into an 87 or okay
or ATO you 6k middle II it's far from an
exact science as the 99er okay is a
physically larger CPU packing more l3
cache but it's about as close as we can
get with the harbor I have available the
core i5 9600 K might make for a better
comparison but I am still waiting for my
chip to arrive so we can revisit that
down the track if need be
that said the 9600 K is basically just a
99 or okay with two of the dies disabled
but you do get a smaller l3 cache anyway
this comparison should give us a pretty
good idea of just how much of an
improvement Intel stim makes for the
first test configuration I locked both
the 19900 K and 8086 K at 4.5 gigahertz
on the MSI Zed 390 godlike blender was
used to place full load on all cores and
again both CPUs were tested with just
six cause active and for this test the
voltage options were left on auto this
saw the 9900 K running at one point one
six volts for the most part and the 8086
K at one point two six volts the 9,900
case of a peat core temperature of 61
degrees and the XTU software also
reported a 61-degree package temperature
the 8086 k on the other hand went as
high as 74 degrees in the package with a
peak core temperature of 70
two degrees so for the 4.5 gigahertz
comparison the solid method reduced
temperatures by 11 degrees a 15%
reduction though as I noted voltages are
also 8% lower the package TDP was also
16% higher on the 8086 cake-eating 125
watts opposed to just 107 watts for the
9900 K that being the case for the next
test I locked the voltage at 1.3 5 volts
on both CPUs leaving the operating
frequency at 4.5 gigahertz this evened
things up and now the 8th gen processor
was hitting a package TDP of 145 watts
while the 9th gen ship hit 144 Watts so
basically the same figures there that's
about a 16% increase for the 8086 K from
the previous test and 35% increase for
the 19900 K this saw the 8086 hit a peak
package temperature of 88 degrees and a
core temperature of 87 degrees with a
typical low voltage of 1 point 3 7 3
volts the 9900 K on the other hand
peaked at a package temperature of 79
degrees and a 78 degrees for the cause
while running at one point 3 6 6 volts
so that's a 9 degree improvement for the
9900 K allowing it to run 10% cooler
that's a decent result for the soldered
CPU that said we are almost already at
80 degrees so how much hotter do things
get a 5 point one gigahertz with the
same 1 point 3 5 volts and what are the
improvements over the 6 core 8th gen
part if you recall I opted to run my 87
or okay test rig at 5 gigahertz as the
temperatures were much more acceptable
than what I was seeing at five point one
gigahertz and the same is true for the
sole at 900k running an average of one
point three eight volts the 8086 K had a
peak temperature of 94 degrees for both
the core and package this resulted in a
package TDP of 188 watts so pretty
toasty stuff and again this is why we
decided to run these processors at 5
gigahertz for our GPU test system in
comparison the 19900 K peaked
91 degrees for the court and 90 degrees
for the package the average voltage
during the test was one point three six
six volts and this resulted in a package
TDP of 181 watts so this means when
overclocking the soldered chip was just
three degrees cooler than what we saw
with the 8th gen model using paste this
also explains why
we saw a 98 degree operating temperature
with all 8 cores active that's actually
a smaller increase than what you'd
probably guess based on the six core
results so why does the 9900 KT go from
offering a nine degree improvement over
the 8086 at 4.5 gigahertz to just three
degrees cooler at 5.1 gigahertz well my
guess would be that we're reaching a
thermal bottleneck with the 99er okay
devourer recently discovered Wendy
letting one of the ninth gen processors
that the dye is significantly thicker
than that of the 8700 K I won't give his
exact measurements but if you want those
please go check out his video it's
certainly worth having a look at as
Devourer notes the thermal conductivity
of the silicon isn't great so the more
of it you have are the more thermal
resistance you'll face and this appears
to be an issue for the 99 hundred K it's
my assumption that this isn't as much of
an issue at 4.5 gigahertz but as we
increase the thermal output the silicon
bottleneck becomes more of an issue as
it starts to degrade thermal performance
to the point where Sol during the IHS is
of little benefit proving this tube our
sanded down the core i5 9600 K so they
can buy just 0.2 of a millimeter and
this reduced temperatures by five and a
half degrees and that's a rather
significant improvement again if you
want a full rundown of all the testing
please visit to Bauer's channel on a
slightly different subject a few viewers
were a bit confused or concerned by my
findings and yesterday's video claiming
that the 9900 entrie aliy be that much
hotter than the Rison 720 700 X as they
both are eight core 16 thread CPUs and
they are both soldered well the main
reason why the night of decay was so
much hotter was because of what we just
saw in this video
clock speed the note on her okay with
just six cores active went from 78
degrees at 4.5 gigahertz just 91 degrees
at 5.1 gigahertz and that's a 17%
increase in operating temperature the
2700 X can be overclocked to around 4.2
gigahertz but by default runs at an all
core clock frequency of 3.8 gigahertz
with the Wraiths prism box cooler about
3.9 gigahertz with an aftermarket
closed-loop cooler for example also
helping manage thermals is the CCX
design which doesn't pack the course as
densely basically you get grouping of
four cores rather than one big block of
eight
so that I imagine that helps quite a bit
basically intel has just been too
aggressive with their clock speeds
though and this has resulted in eight
core CPU that's almost too hot to handle
as for the silicon well there's likely a
number of reasons why Intel has had to
increase the height and I doubt any of
them have anything to do with them being
incompetent as some of the viewers have
suggested in the comments of yesterday's
video pretty sure the Intel engineers
know exactly what they're doing and they
may be quite limited in what they have
to work with at the moment but they know
what they're doing all the same as I
understand it sold during the 80s 700k
would be much more risky as the silicon
could crack during the heating of the
soldering process therefore Intel's been
forced to increase the thickness of the
silicon to better handle the stresses of
the heating process required to melt the
solder a thinner silicon would
complicate the process likely making it
more time-consuming and therefore more
costly then there's the issue of the
thickness of the solder which is quite
thick and some of you suggested in
yesterday's video again that it is too
thick and Intel messed up here and well
that could be possible maybe it is too
thick but I suspect Intel faced a few
issues here as well one being damage a
thinnest solder I would be more prone to
cracking that seems quite obvious
particularly after prolonged use these
chips heat up quite fast and then
depending on the cooler use they can
cool down quite rapidly and this places
a lot of stress on the solder layer now
you can deal heed the 1900 K is Intel I
didn't want to go with a super hard
solder they're gonna try and avoid
cracking there's certainly more work
involved to clean it up opposed to what
we saw with previous generation CPUs
such as the 87 are ok it's much harder
to remove the solder than it is just
wipe away the paste but when doing so
and reapplying with liquid metal that
will reduce temperatures by a further 5
to 10 degrees so there is that however
we're not really fans of D leading here
at harbor unboxed it voids your warranty
it can be a risky process and really we
just rather you didn't have to
particularly when spending at least $500
on a brand new CPU not to mention $500
on a CPU that is unlocked and is
intended to be overclocked at mid elite
is a fun and challenging experiment
Maddon thues with deep pockets but those
of you who just want to overclock
without getting the lab code out the
crazy high 99 okay temperatures will be
quite frustrating they certainly were
for us at the end of the day it seems
like Intel is really just pushing
everything to the limits and therefore
they were forced to solder these chips
in order to maximize the thermal
conductivity overall though it's still a
better method as we are seeing improved
thermal performance especially
out-of-the-box thermals unfortunately
though we are only talking about three
to four maybe five degrees when
overclocking and that is going to do it
