your host Matt and today we're taking a
look at Intel's latest 6th generation
Core i5 6 to 600 K CPU if you haven't
already watched our core i7 6700 K video
I suggest you hit everyone watch that
one as well as we discussed the skylake
architecture in much more detail the
core i5 6600 K isn't that dissimilar to
the 6700 K it too is a 91 white quad
core processor designers take full
advantage of ddr4 memory
however the 6600 K is a little over 30%
cheaper than the 6700 K as we expect to
see a retail price of around 240 dollars
so you might be wondering what you're
missing out on by saving all that money
and going for the cheaper 6600 K the key
missing ingredient is hyper-threading
which affords the 6700 k-8 threads so
this means a 6600 K is limited to four
threads the l3 cache has also been
reduced from 8 megabytes to 6 megabytes
no different to the Haswell core i5s
when compared to the 6700 K the 6600 K
is also clocked slower so this is a
non-issue as both are fully unlocked
CPUs still for those wondering the 6600
K features a three and a half gigahertz
base clock with a maximum single quarter
by frequency of 3.9 gigahertz keeping
that in mind let's head over to the
benchmarks first up we tested using
Cinebench
in the multi-threaded test the 6600 K
managed to eke out the 4690k about of
seven points in the single threaded test
they went CB mark for CB mark and the
4690k got the node by a single point in
the end next we looked at web export and
the story was similar the 6600 and 4690
were extremely close in performance with
the 6600 just winning by 6 points our
Microsoft Excel test results were in
line with the other so far with the 6600
taking point three seconds less to
complete the Monte Carlo workload than
its Haswell counterpart the 4690
unsurprisingly the 7-zip scores weren't
any different with the two CPUs we're
mainly
parents growing virtually the same again
the 6600 K claimed a very minor victory
our Photoshop benchmark was well you can
see for yourself again the 6600 just
edged out the 4690k in our final
workload benchmark we ran it through
hand brake conversion test and
performance was very similar once more
this time though the 4690k claimed its
first scalp next we paired the 6600 k
with a geforce gtx 980 and tested some
games on max quality settings first art
was BioShock Infinite all Intel
generations tests to receive virtually
the same score while within the margin
of error are between 113 frames per
second and 115 frames per second hitman
absolution told the same tale with all
Intel processors that we included
scoring at the 67 points per second or
68 frames per second a third and final
title was Metro Redux where we saw some
separation between the core i5s and the
core i7s the difference between house
well and sky like though was
non-existent our final test was power
consumption with handbrake where the
6600 K performed very well it was
significantly more efficient than its
counterpart the 4690k and used a lot
less power than the i5 and i7 s of
previous generations the core i5 CC 600
K was only really able to match the
performance of the 4690k which is of
course based on what is now a two year
old architecture we were hoping to see a
performance gain of at least 5% but
really even that would have been rather
uneventful the good news is that 6600 K
proved to be much more fuel efficient
than the 4690k consuming 20% less power
in the handbrake test overclocking was
also strengthened the skylight
architecture and our 6600 K overclocked
like a Chan we'll be putting out an
overclocking video next week so be sure
to stay tuned for that one overall the
core i5 6600 K is a solar processor
while it's supported by some fancy new
chipsets and high frequency ddr4 memory
we doubtless will be enough to lure
existing Intel users that have invested
in a Core i5 processor in the last four
years with overclocked 2500 K processors
still doing quite well we think Intel
needs to do more to justify the upgrade
this has been martha hardware unboxed
with the first
live look at the 6600 K processor let me
know what you think in the comments hit

next time yeah
