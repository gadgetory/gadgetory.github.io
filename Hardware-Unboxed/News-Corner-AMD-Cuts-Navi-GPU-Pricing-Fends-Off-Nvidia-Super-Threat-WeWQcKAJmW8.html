at the last news corner before what will
be a huge week of reviews testing and
more so if you're not already subscribed
probably should hit that button now so
you don't miss anything the second it
goes live especially after Jen Rhys
interview that Steve has been slaving
over anyway
still some interesting news to get
through in the meantime the major story
to emerge well I guess right now is that
a and B have cut the prices of their
upcoming navi GPUs yep that's right one
day before these cards officially hit
the market ambi has dropped pricing to
levels they feel are going to be more
competitive in their official statement
OMB says that as you have seen
competition is heating up in the GPU
market we embrace competition which
drives innovation to the benefit of
gamers in that spirit we are updating
the pricing of our Radeon rx 5700 series
graphics cards the new pricing sees the
Radeon rx 5700 XT priced at 399 u.s.
dollars down from 449 while the Radeon
rx 5700 is now priced at 349 USD down
from 379 those of you interested in the
50th anniversary edition of the 5700 XT
will also see a price cut from $4.99 to
449 for this special edition card with a
slight factory overclock this does seem
like a response to individuals new super
cards in particular the GeForce r-tx
2070 super and RT X 2060 super which
occupies slightly higher price points of
$4.99 and 399 dollars respectively
AMD's initial information from the
product unveiling has focused on
comparing the rx 5700 series to the
older non-supe GPUs but with new GPUs on
the market AMD needs to tweak things up
a bit
unfortunately it's annoying that we
can't talk about performance for navi
just yet because we really can't tell
you whether these price cuts take AMD
from an uncompetitive position to
competitive or whether it makes them
even more competitive or whether the
price cards still aren't enough for that
you'll have to wait until a review goes
live in the next few days and yeah I
think it's going to be a really
interesting story
what's great those and the
isn't going to sit around and keep
pricing static they want to be
aggressive and competitive in the
mid-range and that's only going to
benefit consumers who are after a new
graphics card in this highly popular
market segment definitely exciting times
ahead and it's great to see some
competition here to sort of avoid that
whole price-fixing scenario I think some
YouTube creators at the moment are going
on about the situation of price fixing
in the GPU market but with this sort of
competition happening and these sort of
price cuts I don't think that's going to
be a big issue for much longer
in other news a power outage at a
Japanese NAND factory operated by
Toshiba memory and Western Digital
suffered an unexpected power outage
which had huge implications for the
factories NAND output the 13 minute
power outage on June 15 impacted not
only wafers but the production machinery
in the factory which has meant that as
of today the factory's production is
partially halted and won't resume until
mid July Western Digital states that the
power outage impacted six exabytes of
NAND production with one exabyte of
course being 1 million terabytes so an
absolutely massive impact to output
potentially around half of the NAND the
factory would produce within the quarter
Toshiba doesn't state how much of an
impact was made to their NAND production
but if that is taken into account the
overall impact could be higher than just
6 exabytes this level of outage will
have wide implications for the NAND
market it will no doubt have financial
implications for Toshiba and Western
Digital not just from the lost NAND
output but also from clients losing
confidence considering that this
enormous factory alone produces a
significant amount of the world's NAND
this will impact NAND pricing in the
short term at least later this year when
contract pricing is adjusted it's an
interesting time ahead for the nan
market given pricing right now is
basically at an all-time low
hopefully the impact isn't too severe
and we can enjoy cheap SSDs for PC
building into the future AMD has
launched a new highly affordable
workstation class GPU the Radeon Pro WX
3200 for just $1.99 u.s. dollars the WX
3200 comes with certified professional
grade drivers for use with CAD another
creative software and with a single slot
low profile design it should be an easy
addition to a wide variety of
workstation form factors the GPU itself
is Polaris based with 640
stream processes so nothing to get
excited about the desktop consumer GPU
equivalent is around the rx 550 mark
providing 1.66 teraflops of performance
the WX 3200 also provides four gigabytes
of gddr5 memory and in great news for
workstation users there's four mini
DisplayPort outputs each capable of
driving a 4k display the main reason you
buy something like this is if you need
proper 10-bit color support or
certification for a variety of software
and it just slot into an existing
machine it only draws about 50 watts of
power through the motherboard so it
doesn't require any PCIe power which
again makes it a great option for many
existing workstations this story popped
up in my feed earlier this week
suggesting that Nvidia with using
Samsung's Korea fab to produce cheering
GPUs on 11 nanometers the reasoning
behind this was that new super GPUs have
Korea marked on them but as the updated
article points out Nvidia merely
packages Summoner GPUs in Korea it's not
an indication that they were made at an
entirely different fab on a different
node so a bit of fake news on that story
AMD has launched a new bundle that
encompasses a significant portion of
their lineup the bundle isn't for a
specific game rather it's for
Microsoft's Xbox game pass which
recently launched on PC and provides
access to a number of exclusive and
third-party titles for a monthly
subscription fee with this bundle ami is
offering three months of Xbox game pass
for free allowing you to play games like
Forza horizon 4 and gears 5 when it
launches later this year the hardware
included in this deal is well it's
pretty much everything on the GPU side
if you purchase a Radeon RX 5 60 or
above you will be eligible and this
includes Vega cards Radeon 7 and the
upcoming rx 5700 series and then it's
also available for those that buy
horizon 5 2400 G CPU or above including
Rison 5 7 &amp;amp; 9 in the 3000 series so Zen
2 parts are included
however vouchers can't be stacked so you
don't get 6 months for free if you
purchase a CPU and a GPU for example the
bundle is running from now until March
10 2020 so a pretty long bundle here
alternatively it will end when AMD runs
out of vouchers but given this seems to
be part of their long-running
partnership with Microsoft I'd
that will happen anytime soon it's also
a neat way to draw attention to the xbox
game pass for PC which itself is a
pretty good deal if you can get around
using the Microsoft Store this week's
monitor news is focused on AOC they've
recently announced a new
professional-grade 4k monitor there's
also quite affordable in the u 2790 pqu
it's a 27 inch 4k IPS panel with 5
millisecond response times 10-bit color
support not clear if it's a true 10 bit
panel though and wide color gamut
although the specific gamut hasn't been
specified the cool thing here is it will
be available in July for just 300
British pounds which for those in the US
will be under 350 US dollars a great
deal for a 4k panel with those sort of
specs on the gaming front AAC's new high
refresh Aegon monitors and now available
in both 24 inch and 27 inch sizes the AG
251 FZ 2 and AG 271 F said to provide a
1080p resolution with a TN panel and 0.5
millisecond response times there's free
sync support 400 nits of brightness and
all the usual features pricing is three
hundred and thirty dollars for the 24
inch model and $380 for the 27 inch will
be interesting to see how they perform
intel's new entry-level knocks are now
available and they have an interesting
combination of hardware inside the
compact systems with a rather terrible
product name of Intel nook eight
mainstream G include an Intel quad-core
whiskey like CPU alongside an AMD Radeon
540 X GPU with eight gigabytes have sold
at Ram storage options vary depending on
the configuration with bare-bones models
available
the partnership between Intel for CPU
and AMD for graphics II is interesting
but it's not the first time that's
happened unfortunately neither component
will be super powerful the whiskey Lake
CPUs are just 15 watt quad core models
like the core i5
80 265 U or the core i7 85 65 you why
the Radeon 540 X is faster than Intel
integrated graphics but it's not a
significant performance based or
anything pricing for these units is also
a bit weird with an antique finding
these units in a non bare-bones
configuration retailing between seven
hundred and seventy two dollars and 1075
dollars which seems mighty expensive
given the hardware you were getting it
also seems expensive in comparison to
Intel's exist
Nux like been Kenyan anyway for those
that are interested in nukes
these are now an option that's available
to you and that's it for this week's
