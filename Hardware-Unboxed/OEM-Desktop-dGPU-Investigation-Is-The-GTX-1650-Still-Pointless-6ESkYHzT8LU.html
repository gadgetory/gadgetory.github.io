few weeks ago now we reviewed the
geforce gtx 1650 for the first time and
like most in the tech press i think it's
fair to say we weren't overly impressed
but that was okay because most of you
weren't overly impressed either we just
have a few Nvidia fans they've got a bit
upset with our take on things but I did
address those criticisms in a replying
to comments episode the key argument was
power consumption the GTX 1650 consumes
quite a bit less power than the rx 570
and models without a 6-pin PCI power
connector can be used in older om
systems and this provides a
cost-effective upgrade giving them a new
lease on life I questioned just how many
of these older systems could take full
advantage of a gtx 1650 and I was
seriously doubting just how
cost-effective the upgrade really would
be therefore I pledged to track down a
popular early MPC that didn't have a
6-pin PCI II power connector and the
power supply couldn't easily be upgraded
to get around that one this led me to
the HP elite desk 800 g1 so one of these
things here it's a computer that most of
the people who were in favor of the gtx
1650 saying that it wasn't a pointless
product well this was the system that
most of them recommended so I went ahead
and got one of course being an OEM PC
buying novice I purchased the small
form-factor version first so the the
lower profile version of this system you
see here and because there are no low
profile gtx 1650 models available right
now for reasons unknown strange reasons
they must be because yeah a bit bizarre
but anyway because of that I couldn't
use that system so I had to go and get
the mid tower version in my defense
though 99% of all HP elite desk 800 g1
selling on ebay combo you are actually
the small form-factor versions however
by paying a little bit extra I was able
to acquire the mid tower version
sporting a Core i5 4690k eiga bytes of
ddr3 1600 memory and a 128 gigabyte SSD
now the plan for this video was very
simple purchase an HP elite desk 800 g1
kind of got that right
second time around got that right then
the plan was to stick in a gtx 1650 at
1050 TI and an RX 560 obviously not all
at the same time but sure you guys knew
that's not what I meant
anyway then I was to benchmark about a
dozen games and then compared those
results with our high-end test system
the testing I've already done and the
specs for that system and this system
will be in the video description and
weight plan was to do that and then see
how the margins changed did they come
together for example so this I suspected
would be a bit more CPU bound it's a
core i5 with ddr3 memory so it's only a
quad core and would that create a more
CPU bound situation that would see the
margin reduced between the 1650 and the
1050 Ti and well I suppose spoiler alert
this is exactly what I found at least
for the most part okay so I got my shiny
old OAM PC a little over a week ago now
I've been testing it pretty much for the
whole week so it's very late right now
as I'm filming but I just I have to wrap
this up I've got other content to get on
with and this has taken me a whole week
so yeah if I look a bit tired I am sorry
for that but I am quite tired anyway I
got this old banger and I thought yippee
I'll just start benchmarking that's
always I've been interesting to look at
a system like this and look at all the
hardware and see how performs in modern
titles anyway little did I know that it
would end up being much more involved
than what I expected and I'm not talking
about having to update biases or
anything like that the second it arrived
I threw in the GTX 1650 it's currently
in there now I stripped out the 128
gigabyte SSD and I replaced it with a 2
terabyte model so a bit of a quick
upgrade there but that was really
necessary because I had to put a fresh
copy of Windows on it and then I had to
copy all my game files across so one
side windows installed all the drivers
and everything I didn't overnight
transfer to move almost two terabytes of
games onto the drive so I could do a
whole heap of testing so the next day I
woke up and I got on with the testing
however right away I noticed there was
something really bizarre with the
results I was getting this thing just
we're not even just the results just
using this computer itself it just
seemed really sluggish loading games
took way longer than I was expecting
them to
since I was using an SSD and when you
first got into the game it was very very
stuttering I not only got eight gig of
ram and sometimes thank you give RAM can
cause those problems but even in games
like for tonight that aren't super
memory hungry it was yeah
very laggy for the first 30 to 60
seconds and then every now and then
there'd be a bit of a frame started
which you kind of expect with an older
quad core system but the point was it
wasn't running as well as I'd expected
it to and then there the performance
that I was getting the framerate
performance just was nowhere near what I
expected in a lot of the titles and yeah
it is a has while quad quartz has an all
core clock frequency of 3.7 gigahertz so
it's by no means a slow processor he's
one of the worst examples I came across
and also happens to be the first game
that I tested with World War Z is quite
a CPU demanding title due to all the
NPC's running around like mad trying to
eat your flesh basically it had the Core
i5 4690k at a hundred percent for the
entire test though I did see this in
quite a few other games tested and some
of them I wasn't really expecting to see
high C for utilization even with an
older Haswell quad core anyway this is a
worst case scenario when it comes to
gaming we saw a frame time performance
jump by 64 percent when going from the
OEM PC to our high-end desktop system
though with a 1650 you'd honestly get
the same numbers with something like a
risin 520 400 gr of modern core i3 hell
you really shouldn't be that far off
with a house wall quad core so right
away I knew something was wrong here but
to summarize in our test system the 1650
was on average 26 percent faster than
the 1050 Ti not an amazing performance
uplift but fairly decent all the same
now in the OEM PC the 1650 was able to
offer just a four percent performance
increased and yeah that that doesn't
seem right to me rather mess around the
OEM PC any longer I decided to take the
CPU SSD in memory out and stick it on a
z97 motherboard it was late and rather
than investigate what was going on I
just wanted to eliminate the hardware as
potentially defective now doing so still
saw a performance hit but it was nothing
like what we saw in the OEM PC and it
was exactly the kind of performance hit
that I was expecting to see from there
as well quad core CPU whereas our
high-end test system was 64 percent fast
in the HP elite desk when comparing the
one percent low performance it was just
11 percent fire
Master when using the same CPU and
memory on a z97 motherboard
at this point I knew it had to either be
some sort of issue with the software or
a power delivery issue with the OEM
system and my money was on the ladder so
this time after rebuilding the HP system
I did a little bit more investigating by
opening up Hardware info and I ran a
blender workload to stress the CPU I had
suspected that it was a CPU throttling
issue as the performance hit in World
War Z was so extreme meanwhile non CPU
intensive titles such as Forza horizon
for the margins there weren't that
extreme
so with hardware info I opened I noticed
the CPU is only hitting an all-call
frequency of 3.5 gigahertz whereas on
the z97 motherboard it was hitting three
point seven years and that's a 6%
increase but that doesn't really explain
how I was seeing a 15% boost to the
average framerate and a 47% boost to the
one percent low when taking the CPU and
memory out of the OEM PC and sticking it
in as at 97 motherboard I then notice
that the core i5 sustain CPU package
power was 28% higher on this at 97
motherboard now this is partly due to
the fact that the z97 motherboard
increased the v core voltage by 5
percent but I don't think that accounts
for all of the power increase rather I
believe the OEM system was verum
throttling or imposing some kind of
power limit what's interesting about the
HP system is that the proprietary power
supply only has two power connectors
coming out of it a 6 pin and a 4 pin and
that's it
I mean that is absolutely it there is no
20 or 24 pin ATX connector there's no
eight pins there's no molex connectors
there's not even any solder power cables
coming out of the power supply just a 6
pin and a 4 pin power cable then from
the motherboard there's another 6 pin
power output which connect to the SATA
drive so the entire PC the motherboard
the CPU the graphics card the storage
the whole thing is powered from a 4 pin
and a 6 pin power cable and that's it
the motherboard itself packs a pathetic
looking three-phase vcore verum with no
form of cooling so it's completely naked
so aware of all this
I knew the system had to be heavily
Power Limited so I opened up the intel
extreme tuning utility but here I found
that all the settings met
the intel spec the board was limited to
a turbo boost power max of 84 watts with
a short power max boost of 105 watts for
eight seconds however when I ran
Cinebench R 20 I found these limits were
well out of reach of the OEM PC within
just two seconds of hitting the Run
button
the XTU software detected current
throttling at a package TDP of just
thirty-eight watts now normally you can
adjust the current limit on the Zed 97
motherboard it was set to 100 amps for
example yet on the OEM system this
option doesn't even exist that means
it's hard locked and obviously this has
been done to protect the motherboard and
power supply in the end we saw a peek
package TDP of just 49 watts and again
the maximum or call frequency was 3.5
gigahertz in contrast to that the z97
motherboard allowed the core i5 4690k
hit 3.7 gigahertz and a package TDP of
58 watts and no limits were imposed so
that meant the package TDP was 18%
higher than that of the OEM system now
what's really interesting despite only a
6% clock speed advantage and a 28%
increase in sustained CPU package power
the Cinebench r20 CPU score was boosted
by 38%
so although the CPU is reported to have
all cores working at 3.5 gigahertz it's
not operating at full capacity and this
is why we need to look at actual
performance when a processor is limited
by either thermal power or current so in
short this is pretty scummy HP we're
selling businesses a Core i5 4690k
Intel's to blame for this rather it's
just the OEM builders anyway bashing HP
for this poorly designed elite desk 800
g1 isn't really the point of this video
the point is to see how the gtx 1650
performs in a popular OAM pc that
doesn't have a PCIe power cable so that
being the case let's check out a few
more games to get a broader picture of
how this thing performs with the fastest
discrete GPU can get that doesn't
require external power we've already
seen a worst case scenario with World
War Z but here we see a much better
showing for the OEM system with Apex
legends in the desktop system was
just 13% faster on average when
comparing the GTX 1650 numbers and more
importantly the 1650 still offered a
noticeable performance boost over the
1050 TI and a huge performance boost
over the rx 560 so easy upgrade is
working quite well whether or not it's
worth investing $150 u.s. in a graphics
card for a computer of this caliber well
that's an entirely different story and
we'll discuss that later on in the video
now these results are pretty typical of
what we saw in CPU intensive titles in
our test system the 1650 was 26% faster
and the 1050 T on average and 56% faster
for the 1% lower result however when we
moved to the OEM system the 1650 is now
just 18% faster for both the average and
1% low 18% certainly nothing to sneeze
at but it does really hurt the value
proposition of the gtx 1650 the division
2 isn't massively CPU demanding so here
the performance drop off isn't too bad
that said we're not testing a terribly
demanding section of the game we
typically use this section of the game
for GPU testing as it's easy to
replicate for accurate results so the
OEM system will likely fall away a bit
more in the more demanding sections of
the game especially when playing with
friends or against other players moving
on far cry new dawn had the Core i5
4690k
at 100% throughout our testing and as a
result we saw a 23 percent performance
uplift when going from the OEM system to
our high-end test system for the 1650
this meant while the 1650 did offer a
rather nice 23 percent performance boost
over the 1050 ti on our test system it
was just seven percent faster in the HP
elite desk so in this instance the 1650
is really no better than a 1050 Ti and
only 23 percent faster than our X 560 I
have to say the fortnight results are
really surprising I expected to see
similar margins to what we saw in apex
legends that is to say the performance
penalty for the OEM rig wouldn't be that
extreme however that was not the case in
our test system the 1650 was 26 percent
faster than 1050 Ti for the average
frame rate and 24 percent faster for the
one percent load meanwhile in the OEM
system it was 18 percent faster for the
average but just 6 percent faster for
the 1 percent low this meant that
overall the gaming spear
was very similar and there was really no
telling the difference between the two
so due to the poor 1% low performance
the 1650 didn't really prove to be a
worthwhile upgrade in this title now
this is a great example of how these two
systems will compare in a heavily GPU
bound title that doesn't really use the
CPU all that much Forza horizon forward
play just fine with a dual core so the
heavily restricted core i5 4690k except
just fine in the HP elite desk for this
title testing with just core for tolls a
very similar story to that of titles
such as battlefield 5 and fortnight here
the test system saw these 1650 beat the
1050 Ti by a 31% margin when comparing
the average framerate and 30% for the 1%
low however in the OEM system the 1650
was just 17% fast and the 1050 TI for
the average framerate and just 3% faster
for the 1% low so again the game
experience were in the 1650 and 1052 I
was very similar in the OEM system again
we see a similar story with metro Exodus
here the OEM system cripples the 1% low
performance at the point where the 1650
really isn't an upgrade over the 10 52i
moving on although the one percent low
performance also takes a big hit and
Resident Evil 2 the GTX 1650 did offer
noticeably better performance than the
GTX 1050 Ti when installed in the HP
elite desk ok next up we have Rainbow
six siege and please note we only use
the single-player portion of the game as
there's no real way to test multiplayer
accurately so if the multiplayer mode is
more demanding than the OEM system will
struggle more than what's shown here
anyway for the single-player mode the 1%
low performance is still pretty weak but
as was the case with Resident Evil 2 the
1650 is still able to deliver a
noticeably better experience than the
1050 Ti finally we have shuttle of the
term Raider and again we see a
noticeable downgrade performance for the
GTX 1650 when installing and the IM
system in our test rig it was 40% faster
than 1052 I for the average framerate
and 41 percent faster for the 1% low
however in the HP elite desk it was 17%
faster and average and just 12% faster
for the 1% low so that means while the
1650 was an upgrade it was
exactly a big upgrade over the 1050 TI
before wrapping up the gaming benchmarks
I thought it would be worth looking at
how the graphics cards stack up in each
system using medium quality presets
rather than high to ultra so I didn't
have a whole lot of time to do that but
I thought it'd be interesting a check
out so I used fortnight because that's a
game where you probably want a few extra
frames and then World War Z that threw
up some interesting results and the
first round of tests so I thought I
wonder how that goes when we reduce the
quality setting to medium using the
medium quality preset and fortnight
allowed the gtx 1650 to deliver well
over 100 FPS at all times in our test
system meanwhile the OEM system
performance was still decent however the
1650 is no longer a worthwhile upgrade
over the 1050 TI here the 1% low
performance is basically identical while
the 1650 which is 14% faster when
comparing the average framerate
previously using the ultra quality
settings we saw basically identical
performance within the 1050 Ti and the
1650 obviously the medium settings
reduced CPU load is here the 1650 was
able to pull ahead though it was only
12% faster and average so again not
really much of an upgrade here ok so not
much really change with the medium
quality settings at least the margins
didn't change anyway in fact using the
medium to low quality settings that
really seemed to play into the 1050 TI's
favour anyway
quite interesting to look at that but I
think it's time we check out a 12-game
average I think this graph paints a
pretty accurate picture of the situation
the 1650 was 34% faster than the 1050 T
on our test system when comparing the
average framerate and 32 percent faster
for the 1% low then in the OEM system it
was just 24 percent faster on average
but more crucially just 12% faster for
the 1% low so overall the gaming
experience in the OEM system is only
slightly improved by upgrading from the
1050 Ti to the 1650 ok so that's all the
testing done with the HP elite desk 800
g1 finally got through all of it so now
it's just time to wrap this one up
though I suspect it isn't going to be a
quick and tidy wrap-up I think to
conclude this video I probably need to
create a few different scenarios so yeah
let's do that so the first of these
scenarios that I'm going to
this one I'm gonna call the hand-me-down
so you were given an HP elect desk 800 G
one or a similar om system with a
proprietary power supply and motherboard
so you don't have money to build a new
system and you've just got to make do
with this this thing so yeah you've
basically got to turn this into a gaming
rig in the most cost effective and best
way you can now remember the system
doesn't owe you anything so spending a
little bit of money on it isn't too bad
not really a big deal
well at least within reason that said
you don't really want to spend a hundred
and fifty dollars us on it to put a
graphics card in there at least I
wouldn't want to and I have to assume
that most of you guys if you've got a an
old clunker for free or not that I want
to fork out $150 us for a graphics card
especially one that doesn't represent
particularly good value in a new system
if you were to upgrade three or six
months down the track or whenever it may
be the gtx 1050 i to me seems to be a
better fit for this this sort of rig and
I certainly wouldn't buy a gtx 1050 TI
brand new either but you can get them
secondhand for under $100 u.s. the
average selling price on ebay at the
start of the you and I did my used GPU
buying guide that was a hundred and five
dollars but I had a quick look just
recently and there are quite a few
models selling for $80 us and for me
that seems like a reasonable investment
for this kind of system alternatively a
Radeon rx 560 for around $50 that's a
real possibility and this is probably
the way I'd go of course I'm talking
about a secondhand radio rx 560 but I
think for a system like this a secondary
graphics card probably makes the most
sense and that will allow really great
performance when you use low to medium
sort of quality settings very playable
frame rates there and it will just turn
this thing into a really good value
gaming system frankly I think that's
probably the best investment you can
make here makes the most sense to me for
this scenario spending $150 u.s. that
just doesn't seem realistic to me or
certainly doesn't seem like a wise
investment anyway second scenario you're
after a cheap PC and you're considering
buying an HP elite desk 800 g1 or a
similar om system with a
Dietary power supply and motherboard
well my advice to you is quite simply
don't do that it's just a terrible idea
my advice would be do some research and
avoid any PC with a custom motherboard
and power supply because chances are
they're going to be garbage anyway and
they're definitely going to be very
difficult to upgrade and you've pretty
much locked into that so it's just a
really bad idea do your research and
avoid that
like I said in scenario one if you've
given this that's a different thing but
we've covered that in scenario one
scenario two is you're looking for a
cheap PC so yes avoid these at all costs
it doesn't make sense
I paid $350 Australian so apologies to
my patreon members for spending that
money but I think it's an interesting
experiment every three or $50.00
Australian or a hundred and eighty
dollars u.s. so if you want to spend
that kind of money on this system well
frankly you're beyond my help but anyway
not to be rude $180 for this one hundred
and fifty dollars for a GTX 1650 and
you've got yourself a really really
terrible value combo I have to say as a
side note one of our long-term and very
active patreon community members Sal
Kagan he put together a system on our
discord chat knee posted a link for
others to check out I thought that's a
really good system it's worth including
in this for a bit more information so
basically for just shy of 500 dollars
like $550 sorry that's before rebates it
was about $500 with rebates he created a
mid tower build that would absolutely
decimate the HP elite desk 800 G one
with the gtx 1650 and it was only about
$200 more yeah toradol is a bit of money
but considering what you're getting I
think it's just worth saving up a little
bit longer because your money is going
so much further it's not even a fair
comparison you'll see the specs up on
screen I'll try to remember to put a
link in the video description for you
guys but yeah it's just it's so much
better the system he admitted that he
was going a bit overboard with the
storage capacity on the SSD the power
supply was had it been a Headroom in it
and he put 16 gigs of RAM which we
recommend but you could have saved a bit
of money and gone with a beer so there
would be possible to make that new
system even cheaper but I don't think it
it's probably not worth saving the Torah
dollars like I said just save up for a
bit longer if a $500 you're getting a
really good platform there that you can
upgrade in the future and make even
better now moving on to my third
scenario you've managed to buy an OEM
system that's not a steaming pile of
trash and it won't strangle a GTX 16:50
to death but it also doesn't have a
6-pin pci power connector so does it
make sense to spend $150 to put a gtx
1650 in it and enjoy around a 30%
performance boost over the gtx 1050 tii
that's almost a tough one I would say
but again a secondhand 1050 toi can
easily be had or quite easily be had for
$80 US and that makes the 1650 almost
ninety percent more expensive obviously
if you're buying any kind of system like
this I think it's fair to say you're on
a shoestring budget so in this third
scenario does it make sense to spend 90%
more on something new that's only around
30% faster in terms of performance and
that is over a gtx 1050 i not only that
but I would say when using the medium
quality settings at 1080p the experience
is really very much the same in pretty
much all games so it's not like you're
getting a noticeably better experience
with the 1650 especially if you're going
to use those medium quality settings
which I think most of you would be in a
system like this in this scenario we
also have to assume for whatever reason
you can't watch a quick YouTube tutorial
on how to change an ATX power supply
it's pretty simple stuff and if you've
got the case door off you're pretty well
halfway there yeah there's a little bit
more to it than that but like I said I'm
confident most people could quite easily
upgrade one of these things by watching
a quick youtube tutorial and the chances
are you can probably find a really
detailed youtube tutorial for the exact
ôm system you're trying to upgrade the
power supply and so it's not like you're
watching a generic how to upgrade your
power supply and then if you're
competent enough to pull that off then
you can throw in a $35 power supply and
chances are you're improving the whole
system overall with that higher rated
power supply and then you've opened
yourself up to a myriad of options so
you can you can put an Rx 570 in there
you can put an rx 580 in there you can
you can put a GTX 1060 you get the idea
you can put pretty much anything in
there I don't remember in this scenario
you've kind of done the impossible and
managed to buy an OEM system that's not
a steaming pile of junk so that in
itself should warrant a PSU upgrade that
will enable you to take advantage of a
much faster graphics card like the rx
570 now getting back to my horrible HP
elite desk 800 g1 it's a bit awkward I
know it's sitting right here but sorry
mate you you do suck pretty badly so
getting back to this thing for the grand
total of seven dollars Aussie shipped I
was able to order a 24-pin two 6-pin
power supply adapter and yeah you would
have seen the b-roll but here is that's
your that's your replacement for a
24-pin ATX power connector or even a 20
pin power connector in that system so
you can get an adapter that will allow
you to put a standard ATX power supply
in this very system and it cost me seven
dollars to get one delivered from I
think it's coming from China that would
probably make sense but I got it off
eBay seven dollars and when that arrives
I will be able to hook up a bigger power
supply and I'll connect up the rx 517
and see how it goes
I mean overall I'm expecting that
performance will still suck but for
basically the same price as chucking a
GTX 16:50 in there we can get a better
power supply and a faster graphics card
which may or may not give us a few extra
frames I mean for titles that aren't CPU
intensive like Forza horizon for they
will run quite a bit better so perhaps
that will warrant them messing about if
you get one of these things for free so
anyway it seems pretty clear to me no
matter which way you slice it at $150 us
the geforce gtx 1650 is a bloody
pointless product so I stand by what I
said in my initial review my initial
evaluation of it having looked into this
in multiple different ways in much more
depth I think that was still a fair
point to make and $100 as I said in my
day 1 review it would be an absolutely
amazing product excellent value
you could then push how great the
consumption is and how versatile a card
is but $150 it doesn't make sense even
for the intended purposes which are
apparently to breathe new life into OEM
systems finally there is a whole other
conversation here but we don't really
have time for it in this video but I'll
just summarize quickly not that long ago
there was a discussion started around
Intel's TDP and how it's becoming less
and less accurate
there was concern and quite rightfully
so as it turns out that this would cause
trouble for OMS who are only build to
the Intel spec with quite literally zero
Headroom we saw issues with the Intel
Core i7 8700 the non K model it
throttles quite badly with the included
box cooler and there were reports of a
few OEM systems that were about 20%
slower than the results reported by
those building their own systems but as
I said a moment ago this really is a
whole other conversation but it's still
interesting to find that this is far
from a new issue even well before Intel
started playing fast and loose with
their TDP ratings this appears to have
been a real issue held the core i5 4690k
entire Haswell core i5 range featuring
84 watt TDP yet this part which is
actually the flagship locked part that
never hit a packaged TDP of even 60
watts so Intel had plenty of headroom
back when they were doing their TDP
ratings for the has more parts anyway
I'm glad we've got two I'm glad I
purchased this system I've got to expose
just how garbage these lem systems are I
mean for an office type PC I suppose
it's ok even though you're not getting
the full performance of the CPU that
you're paid for but that's a whole
different kettle of fish that we're not
going to get into in this video but I
think if you're looking at trying to
purchase one of these for $180 u.s. or
even $100 u.s. whatever you might be
able to get one for I would just I'd
give it a wide berth I wouldn't touch it
with a 50 foot pole it's just not worth
the time and effort and yeah I think
most of you will probably agree with me
on that one they should just be avoided
at all costs anyway I've had enough
trashing this thing I think I'm done
with this video
it's been a long one I don't know how
well or how long it ran for I'm very
tired but if you watch the whole thing
you enjoyed it then well
very happy about that and thank you very
much for watching all of it
make sure you like the video that would
be much appreciated for all the time and
effort I put into this bloody thing you
can subscribe for more content and if
you want to become a patreon member to
support videos like this then that would
be much appreciated you also get access
to our discord chat monthly livestream
all that good stuff anyway thank you for
watching I'm your host Steve and I'll
see you again next time hopefully I
won't have an oem system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
