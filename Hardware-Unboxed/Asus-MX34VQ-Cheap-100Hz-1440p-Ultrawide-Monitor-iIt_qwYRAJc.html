unboxed here at hardware box we're
focused on PC gaming we want you guys
out there to have the best possible PC
gaming experience within your budget and
part of that involves recommending high
quality gaming monitors but as it turns
out gaming focus models aren't the only
monitors on the market sometimes you can
get a great experience for less cash by
venturing outside of known gaming sub
brands like a soos ROG and ace of
predator this is why today we're looking
at the assist designer curve MX 34 b2 it
may come as a bit of a surprise but the
MH 34 vq is the cheapest 34 40 by 1440
ultra wide display you can get with the
refresh rate of 100 Hertz and it doesn't
skimp on features hit this price point
the Malheur comes with a Qi wireless
charging base decent Harman Kardon
speakers and support for free sync
before I spend a bit of time on the
design let's talk monitor specifications
the MX 34 week you use a 34 inch VA
panel with a resolution of 34 40 by 1440
rated for a maximum brightness of 300
nits a contrast ratio of three thousand
to one 178 degree viewing angles and
formula ii graded gray response times it
has an 1800 R curvature which is the
most aggressive curved option used in
today's monitors along with a free sink
window of 48 to 100 Hertz with support
for low framerate compensation asus has
clearly gone with an office suitable
design for this monitor the circular
metal stand answer the highest weren't
pretty good here and I certainly prefer
this sort of design to suits aggressive
gamer style designs they use for their
ROG align the rear uses a combination of
textured and
untextured plastic that again looks neat
and tidy just as you'd want for an
office setup where the rear of the model
is potentially visible the money isn't
slim by any stretch though the curve
hides a bit of the fat so it doesn't
look outrageous unfortunately the
attractiveness of the designer has
severely limited its flexibility as the
monitor only supports tilt adjustments I
think a height adjustment is a bigger
mission here the displaced it's fairly
low down much lower than I'd normally
use from
and that may be an issue for some users
the most unique feature that the MX 34
v2 is Qi wireless charging support which
is included through a disc that sits in
the middle of the glass base the
charging isn't usually powerful only
supporting 5 watts of delivery so that's
typical of most qi wires charges you can
by having ones charging in your
modernist and is surprisingly handy as
you can keep your phone charged with
that wise while your phone is on your
desk the stands base lights up when the
Qi charger is activated which is a nice
touch to let you know the charger is
working I tested it with my totally not
at all broken Galaxy s7 edge and it
worked perfectly
as for the monitors Harman Kardon
speakers I was surprised at how decent
they work for integrated monitors
speakers the two downward firing 8 watt
speakers produce sound equivalent to an
entry-level stereo speaker setup and
while that's nothing particularly
amazing there's more depth and bass to
the speakers than I was expecting the MX
34 VQ comes with a decent array of
connectivity 3 HDMI 2.0 ports and a
single DisplayPort 1.2 connector plus
3.5 mm audio input for the speakers
of course you can get audio through both
HDMI and DisplayPort there's no USB help
on the monitor though I don't often use
USB hubs amana's anyway so I guess for
me that's not a huge omission if you're
fan of slim bezel this monitor will
leave you reasonably impressed with nine
millimeter bezels on the left and right
sides if for some unknown reason you're
planning to pair up multiple MX 34 v
cues for some ridiculous and quite
fantastic experience you should
definitely get a very nice experience
here don't screen display is controlled
through a directional toggle which still
remains the best way to control any OSD
in my opinion do you find a range of
typical controllers to get you know your
scenes for color adjustment blue light
filters input selections even a
picture-in-picture mode
there's nothing who's the amazing
that'll be found new it's deeper you
know at least it can be navigating with
ease before I get into color performance
I didn't want to touch a little on the
display to refresh rate and support for
free sync as I mentioned earlier we're
looking at a 48 to 100 Hertz adaptive
sync window that the monitor does
support LFC so the variable refresh
range is effectively from 0 to 100 Hertz
this is important to note as many other
1440p free sync ultra wide
do not support LFC and to have a more
limited refresh window more like 40 to
75 Hertz I wouldn't buy a monitor with
such a high minimum refresh rate that
doesn't support NFC but it isn't a
concern with the MX 34 BQ moving over to
color performance and let's first look
at how the MX 34 vq looks directly out
of the box with no tweaks first
impressions aren't particularly great
white levels are set to 233 nits with a
contrast ratio of just 2148 to one which
is well below that 3000 to one figure a
soos gives for this monitor setting the
monitors maximum brightness produces
just 277 nets which again is below the
maximum of 300 nits that a source is
rated this monitor for great scale
performance is mediocre and that's due
to soos using the wrong color
temperature by default a temperature
average of 75 92 K is too cold for
proper srgb standards and that leads to
a delta 80 mm a verge of 4.49 in our
grayscale sweeps ghetto of 2.2 is good
as an average value the looking at gamma
graph reveals performance isn't ideal
across the entire range and following on
from that mediocre grayscale performance
saturation performance isn't great Delta
II mm value is 3.21 and although we are
seeing srgb coverage of 99.9 percent
greens and Red's are extended beyond the
srgb spectrum and blues don't quite
reach the same level zero a custom color
checker Delta 2000 a verge of three
point three seven seven and that isn't
particularly ideal either but you can
use the OSD to modify some settings as
per the table that we're showing now and
that can lead to better results
calibrating for srgb and 200 Nets of
brightness using these settings pulls
back the color temperature to a better
64 19k although it still came in the
expense of contrast which again reduced
to 1871 to 1 it's important to note that
while some grayscale values are improved
50 to 80% white values are notably
tinted red which leads to an average
delta value of 2.10
you can to correct the red tint though
this comes at the expense of accuracy at
full white and in other areas saturation
results show the red tint affecting
saturation accuracy though other colors
have improved to deliver an average
Delta 2004
2.07 color checker results improved to
2.2 93 as well
and while these values are improved
they're still not good enough for me to
recommend this minor for color accurate
work to achieve better results you'll
need a calibration tool so using my eye
1 display Pro calibration tool I was
able to create a display profile in
spectra Cal Cal 9 5 that delivers
significantly better results where scale
improves to an average de of 0.64 with a
CCT average of 64 31k which is a great
result that removes the red tint the
symptom of a saturation average of 0.8 6
and a color checker average of 1.2 -
these results are very solid
particularly grayscale and saturation so
provided you have a color calibration
tool the LXE 4vq isn't the worst choice
for those that require srgb accuracy
however you will need that color
calibration tool to achieve these
results as needed the default nor oh s 3
calibrated results are good enough it's
also worth looking at displayed
uniformly curved displays tend to have a
few issues with uniformity more than
flat displays and that seems to be the
case with this monitor the upper left of
the monitor is the worst and that
deviates this is from the center the
most we have relative Delta a mm value
in the 4.0 range not the best
performance in this regard though not
entirely surprising at the end of the
day the asustor MX + 34 v2 is a decent
34 40 by 1440 ultra wide option with a
strong feature list its price point of
799 US dollars though it can be often
found for lower someone's and 20 dollars
makes it the cheapest ultra wide of this
kind with a 100 Hertz refresh rate an
important specification for those
willing to use it as a gaming monitor
support for free sync with low framerate
compensation is appreciated
though you might need to wait for an D
Vega to arrive as no current ambu
graphics card is truly capable of
getting the most out of a 34 40 by 1440
display at 100 Hertz still it's always
nice to get a more office oriented
display that includes gaming features
like a high refresh rate and adaptive
center sport and these features add to
its flexibility and suitability for a
wide range of users so unless you need
g-sync the MX 34 v-cube indigenous for
those after a 1440p ultra particularly
thanks to its
the price tag if your interest in this
moment as always you can check its price
