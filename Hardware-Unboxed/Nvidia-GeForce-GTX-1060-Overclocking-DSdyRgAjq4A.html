GTX 1060 benchmark video where I threw
no less than 25 games in videos new
mid-range contender in short the 1060
does indeed deliver gtx 980 live
performance making at 12% faster than
the RX 4 ad on average this advantages
however neutralized by the cost per
frame ratio which also sees the 1060
cost 12% more the gtx 1060 does consume
quite a bit less power and this resulted
low operating temperatures for the
nvidia graphics card the design of the
pascal architecture is also enabled
nvidia to operate a greater frequencies
out of the box the 1060 is clocked at
least 37 percent higher than the RX for
eddie what i want to know is through
overclocking can the 1060 distance
itself further from AMD tsar X 480 we
already know that the arcs for it is a
pretty rubbish overclocker at least the
reference card is anyway overclocked
seem to range from 13 20 megahertz up to
almost 1400 megahertz
my card hits a ball it just 1350
megahertz and this allowed for around 5%
more performance the Pascal based 1080
and 1070 weren't amazing overclock is
but we've been able to squeeze 15 to 20%
more out of the board partner cards over
in video stock operating specs if we can
boost the 10 60s performance by at least
10% then this could provide in videos
mid-range GPU with a tangible advantage
here's a quick look at the maximum
overclocked operating frequency of the
cards we tested the focus here will be
on the GTX 1060 and on our X 480 the
route of interest the GTX 980 and GTX
970 have also been overclocked please
note that although the 1060 founds
Edition cards been overclocked to 1731
megahertz for the base and 1933
megahertz for the boost it's actually
operating at around 2.1 gigahertz in our
tests due to the way in videos GPU boost
3.0 technology works for a full list of
the test system specs please check the
video description and please note only
AMD and NVIDIA reference cards been used
alright let's do this thing
first up we'll check out how the
overclocked 1060 fared in battlefield 4
our overclock netted us in the level %
gain which placed at a whopping 38%
ahead of the reference our X 480
this was also 13% faster than the
overclocked 970 which was 8 FPS behind
on 64 the 10
was reeled in a little but the 1060 was
still 18% behind next up we've got ARMA
3 and here the 1060 was able to add a
similar 9% performance to its original
figures with a new average of 51 FPS
this made it an even bigger 42% faster
than the stock rx 480 and 31% faster
than the 480 overclocked these are
pretty significant numbers so far but
I'm not sure if we'll continue to see
margins this big and our other games
tested again we were able to extract 10%
extra performance from the 1060 this
time and Star Wars Battlefront this
meant we had a 6 FPS gain as well as a
more reasonable 23% margin over the rx
480 and 14% once both cards were
overclocked the 1060 was now within 17
percent of the bigbrother 1070 but was
only 8 percent faster than the
overclocked 970 in Just Cause 3 we saw
another 11% gain in performance of 1440p
through our overclock so the average
gains are starting to become pretty
clear this time the overclocked 1060 was
20% faster than the 480 and 15% faster
than the overclocked for Eddy while it
was 5% faster than stock 980 now and 19%
slower than the 1070 we tacked on for
FPS in Far Cry primal with our overclock
applied which translated to a 9% game
these 50 frames were good for a 19
percent margin over the 480 and this was
reduced to 14% once both cards were
overclocked this overclocked 1060 was
now 9% faster than the 980 and 16%
faster than the overclocked 970 our
final game tested was the division and
here we actually found our smaller
scanning performance through
overclocking we were only able to
extract an extra 3 fps
and a 50 FPS this translated to just a
6% game this minute was still 19% faster
than the 480 and 14% faster than the OCR
X 480
while it was 11% faster than the 980 so
really the stock performance was
relatively better here compared to other
cards and other games I was really
impressed with the 1060 s performance in
terms of power consumption the stock
clock and whether overclocked applied
this total system power consumption
figure only increased from 195 watts to
211 this was an 8% increase in
consumption for a 9 percent gain in
performance so I'm willing to bet this
trade-off will be considered well worth
it for most gamers perhaps more
significant is the fact that at 211
watts was still using temps and less
than the stock clocked our X 480
reference card while Pompey an
additional 27% performance on average so
once again
thoroughly impressed with the 1060
founders editions efficiency
unsurprisingly the 1060 runs cool - in a
stock config we're running at a cool 64
degrees after 20 minutes of gameplay or
1440p and once overclocked this number
only increased to 70 degrees all around
impressive stuff and a testament to the
efficiency of the Pascal architecture
prior to any other clocking the GTX 1060
was an average 12 percent faster than
the rx for Eddy through overclocking
wherever them more than double that
margin to 27 percent however once we
compared the maximum overclocked
performance of both the 1060 and 480 we
find that in video comes out with a 19%
performance advantage at almost 20%
faster than the RX 480
the GTX 1060 provides gamers who are
willing to overclock a real advantage I
should point out though the 1060
overclock on the founds edition graphics
card only needed us 9% more performance
on average but that's still a lot better
than we're able to achieve with the R X
480 reference card of course the real
overclocking battle between these two
GPUs will take place once the AMD and
NVIDIA partner cards become available I
actually have the power of GTX 1060
super jet stream on hand so you can
check out that video here and I'll also
have the video on gigabytes GTX 1060 g1
gaming shortly as well so far there's no
word on custom arcs 480 cards Weber so
we'll have to continue to wait patiently
for those what do you guys think of the
1060 is overclocking was a more or less
what you expected let me know in the
comments I'm your host Matt as always
