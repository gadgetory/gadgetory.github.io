are checking out the asou sir ROG Strix
gtx 1660 TI OC edition yeah a
classically long a Seuss name there and
I think they know what to settle on for
these graphics cards they I think
they're so amazing that there's no one
word that can possibly convey that to
you guys so so they pick 30 anyway
frustratingly long name aside this thing
really is a beast I'm not sure which
point a soos just draw the line and say
we're not putting an extreme high-end
cooler on a budget graphics card but
apparently it's not for a GPU that has a
$280 US MSRP of course I don't expect
this ROG Strix model to come in at the
MSRP it was absolutely zero chance
that's going to happen the more
expensive GTX 1662 our models come in
more around 310 dollars u.s. we saw that
with the MSI gaming X model and frankly
if you can get this behemoth for that
price then I would consider it a rather
good buy and I say that knowing full
well that you can snap up an RT X 2060
for as little as three hundred and fifty
dollars because realistically to get
something of similar quality you're
really looking at having to spend at
least three hundred and eighty dollars
u.s. anyway at this point I have no idea
how much the arrow Strix model is going
to sell for as it isn't available at the
time of making this video right now you
can buy the asou sphenoid sits a single
fan model for $280 but their dual fan
model which doesn't look that impressive
with just their basic dual fan model
that costs an eye-watering three hundred
and ten dollars u.s. so that makes me a
little bit concerned for this Strix
model of course graphics card pricing is
quite volatile and given how new the
1662 eyes are it's probably going to be
another month or so before pricing
settles down therefore while I can't
properly evaluate the value of a Seuss's
mighty ROG Strix gtx 660ti oversea
edition I can see how well it performs
and that should give you all the info
you need to determine if it's a
worthwhile
purchase or not once it actually goes on
sale so with all that out of the way
let's take a look at this thing if
you're aware of the higher-end Strix
graphics cards then this 1660 TI model
will look pretty familiar it presents as
being basically the same cooler as what
we saw on the massive Strix r-tx 2060
however there are some crucial
differences which we will see once I
take the cooler off but externally it's
pretty surprising to see that this model
actually features the newer axial tech
fans as soos claims these fans are
faster and stronger and it's pretty
obvious that they will be stronger and
you'd be pretty hard pressed to break
one of the blades off the card itself
measures 301 millimeters long 132
millimeters tall and 50 millimeters wide
making it a very long and tall triple
slot graphics card that being the case
you probably won't be surprised to hear
that it weighs in at a rather hefty 1195
grams and that makes it almost 40%
heavier than the msi gtx 1660 t8 gaming
ex model that we featured in our day 1
coverage around on the back side of the
car we find a full length backplate and
again this is the same version that we
found on some of the previous Strix
models so there aren't any thermal pads
here and therefore it's not being used
as a heat spreader rather it's just a
shield for the back side of the PCB
removing the cooler we find a soos is
using a cut-down version here when
compared to what we saw on the RT X 2060
this version isn't cooling the vrm and
it features three smaller fin arrays
opposed to well two larger arrays
there's also just three six millimeter
copper heat pipes while the RT X 2060
version featured the six still the GTX
1662 eye is a much smaller GPU and the
TDP has been dropped down by 25% to 120
watts so I suspect this cooler will be
more than sufficient in fact it could
even be borderline overkill the rest of
the cut is wrapped in a large heat
spreader which covers the GDD r6 memory
as well as the vrm and given the GTX
1662 our only sips power a soos has been
able to get away with a six phase veeram
for the GPU and then a two-phase vrm for
the GDD r6 memory then feeding power
into the card is a single 8 pin PCIe
power
then finally around on the i/o panel
there's two display ports and two HDMI
ports most gtx 1660 TI cards that i've
seen only feature a single hdmi port
with three display ports so again this
is a slightly different configuration
from a soos anyway enough going over the
card I think it's time to test this
thing out as usual with our graphics
card reviews the focus is on operating
temperatures power consumption and
overclocking I'll touch on
out-of-the-box performance a little bit
but only in a few games there's no need
to throughout our entire benchmarks we
do this thing first off I wanted to see
how hot the Strix model gets out of the
box so as we often do I fight up f1 2018
and run it on loop for an hour with an
ambient room temperature of 22 degrees
the card maxed out just 60 degrees and
that's seven degrees cooler than the MSI
gaming X model again that we checked out
in our day 1 coverage you'll also notice
in the f1 2018 footage that the core
clock speed hovered around 1935
megahertz and this was the typical
operating frequency seen across a number
of titles this is also the same
frequency that the MSI gaming ex-model
operated up as for the GDD i6 memory I
measured the peak surface temperature at
just 65 degrees using a k-type
thermocouple while the vrm power stage
is picked at just 52 degrees both of
these reported temperatures are
exceptionally low so the cooler is doing
a good job of directing airflow over the
heat spreader ok so a quick look at some
gaming benchmarks and this here is why I
don't focus too heavily on these gaming
benchmarks when evaluating AIB models
here we see when testing with shut of
the Tomb Raider there's soos and MSI
models provided identical performance
meanwhile the most extreme variation was
seen as Strange Brigade here the asou
Strix card was 1 to 2 FPS fastest so not
much more to say here really but we will
wrap up the testing with forza horizon
for the gtx 1662 eye basically matches
the r-tx 2060 graphics card that was
just for FPS down on these Strix RT X
2060 model
overclocking using MSI Afterburner went
really well the card accepted plus 130
for the core and plus 1,500 for the
memory which was actually the maximum
value that the MSI Afterburner
utility would allow us to input and then
finally I maxed out the power and temp
limits this resulted in a typical
operating frequency of two thousand and
ten megahertz of the core and eighteen
hundred and seventy-five megahertz for
the memory though afterburner reports
the DDR speed as seven thousand five
hundred and one megahertz the GPU
temperature gain maxed out at just sixty
degrees though this time I currently
just here the fans over the other fans
inside the case it seems like fan speed
reporting wasn't working at the time of
testing though so I can't give you the
exact RPM overall they're a solid
overclock and this is the best result
I've seen from a gtx 660ti yet oh and
just lastly wrapping up the testing I
have some quick power consumption
numbers though they're just as exciting
as becaming benchmarks we just looked at
please note for testing I was using our
core I 999 hero K system clocked at 5
gigahertz with 32 gigabytes of ddr4
memory and as expected the asou Strix
model closely matches what we saw from
the MSI gaming X 270 watts for the total
system which is great but it's also
pretty typical for a GTX 16 60 TI okay
so I really do like those suits ROG
Strix GTX 1662 IOC Edition not in love
with the name but I'll learn to live
with it because this is an extremely
impressive GTX 1660 TI graphics card
it's also and I'm gonna get pulled up
for saying this but it's also kind of
cool how those of you who don't have
money for an extreme high-end graphics
card you know an RT X 2080 or god forbid
a 2080 ti you can still get your hands
on something that looks impressive
something that looks really high-end I
don't know that sounds shallow hearing
it out loud does sound a bit shallow but
still for those of you that take pride
in your system I think this is pretty
neat
of course the Strix GTX 1662 I goes
beyond just looking impressive in terms
of cooling performance it's likely the
best GTX 1662 I model available right
now that said I must admit I am very
very concerned about the price as good
as this card is if a soos has to price
it above 310 dollars u.s. then it'll be
a hard pass from me and
then at 310 dollars u.s. which which is
the can't retail price for the MSI
gaming X model it'll be hard to justify
that price given that baseball RTX 2060s
can be hard for three hundred and fifty
dollars so with a big question mark over
the price
I really can't in good conscience
recommend you race out and buy one of
these once they go on sale pricing
really is everything for these lower
tier cards so make sure you review all
your options and frankly I'd be very
tempted to look at something like so
tacks gaming or MSI's Ventus models for
just 280 dollars u.s. I couldn't
somewhat justify the mark-up for the RT
X 2060 version of the ROG Strix
thingamajiggy but for this gtx 1660 TI
version yeah it could be a bit of a
stretch again don't know the pricing
i've probably stressed that enough at
this point but it does make reviewing a
product very difficult if you don't know
what it actually costs but yeah it's
it's gonna be north of 300 dollars I
think that's pretty safe to say anyway I
think it's pretty safe to say I don't
have much more to say on this subject at
this point I think we've covered this
reasonably well and if you think so well
you can you can do the thumbs up thing
on the video we much appreciate that you
can subscribe for more content and if
you happen to appreciate the work we do
here at our own box then you can support
us directly on patreon you will also
gain access to a discord chat very cool
chatroom over there and monthly live
streams we only do two main things and I
nearly forgot the second one was be a
Tim and I do a monthly live stream at
least once a month we get together and
do that and it's a whole lot of fun I
think for then this month Tim is gonna
come here for the first time in a long
time so that should be a lot of fun
anyway thank you for watching
I'm your host Dave see you again next
