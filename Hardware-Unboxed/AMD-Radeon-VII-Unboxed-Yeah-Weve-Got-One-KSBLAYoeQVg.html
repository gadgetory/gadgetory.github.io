know what time it is we finally have the
Radeon 7 here we saw at CES and now well
it's just time to unbox it really no
benchmarks or anything like that so just
an unboxing but I will take the cooler
off the card we'll get a good look at
the PCB good look at the the cooler all
around and maybe there'll be something
interesting there but if you don't like
unboxings then I would look away now
because that's all this video is which
is what the title should have indicated
anyway but we find it fun it's good to
show you guys that we do have a sample
even though I accidentally let the count
of the bag in yesterday's video and that
was definitely by accident and I said it
up here thinking it was out of frame I
was in a hurry okay anyway we have one
so that means we do have a detailed
benchmark video on the way reviews will
go out on the seventh so that's it's
actually like Friday morning I think
here at about 1 a.m. late Thursday night
in some parts different times in other
parts anyway we have the box here this
is not retail packaging this is the
special reviewers Edition the shill
Edition via this is just made for
reviewers I know a lot of people don't
like the fact that we don't unbox retail
packaging kind of get it but whatever
it's just a bit of fun really so let's
let's let's take a look inside now I
don't know I actually have open to this
so I've pretty much nearly completed
testing the cards I've done thermals
power consumption I've tested quite a
few games now I have a few more ago and
there's a few things I want to look into
a few little things anyway I have I have
opened this box so this might be a
surprise to me but it will be for you so
we'll take this off tada there we go you
are just shocked and all whose is the
reaction because there's no way you've
seen this exact card before being held
by Lisa and say yes and you won't have
seen the photos or anything isn't it
this will be the first time you've seen
this anyway we have some other stuff
here which I haven't actually looked
yet so I have seen it in the farm but I
haven't taken it out it's a massive
absolutely massive acrylic block and if
you guys remember they did a similar
thing for the Vega launch we've got a
pair of three Triple A batteries
okay so we'll stick this back that's a
pretty cool box pretty cool not the
retail packaging but still pretty cool
I've messed up my mouse pad here okay
this is very heavy massive slab of
acrylic and the cool thing about this is
we have one of their seven nanometer
GPUs here with the HBM to memory around
it that's just 16 gigs there this will
be a defective die I imagine don't know
if it's all defective but yeah it'll be
so you can see that don't know how why
you can see I'll try and get some b-roll
of it till the balls on the back of it
the BGA grid and then we have the card
and I think it's designed yep looks like
I've done that right got it right the
first time it's designed to sit how's
the card so you're not actually going to
put this in your computer and use it
it's just going to sit there so that's
it job done we'll stick these in and it
looks like there's some sort of lighting
underneath and bear with me for a moment
I'll try and get these suckers out talk
amongst yourselves while I do this you
can jump in the comments and tell
everybody how much you love unboxing
videos and then harbour unbox does the
best unboxing videos we deliver on the
name so there you go
we've got RGB it's transitioning to like
a pinky purple now going to red
so probably doesn't look that great for
the studio lights on let's see it
unboxing over I hope that was as
exciting as you thought it was gonna be
when you saw the thumbnail and title
so we've got we've got our thread Ripper
acrylic thing there with a dummy CPU in
it that was very very cool I love that
rockin it Fresno PD we also got this
with Vega so and we also got this so
there is Vega 64 or 56 it doesn't really
matter
same deal so there's that so they were
separate last time and now they've
integrated into one big heavy slab so
that's pretty cool
let's move it off to the side here but
of course you won't got to get your
hands on one of these because it's
reviewers only so no never I guess
anyway we will we will move this to the
side does look very cool I have to admit
it's a bit of a shame that you can't get
that of some sort of collector's edition
thing note that you going to buy it and
then just sit the graphics card in it
and that's really its its main purpose
is to hold the graphics card so let me
sink out on too much there does look
cool but not it's not very practical
alright I think what we'll do here is
well suppose I should talk a little bit
about the card before we pull it apart
but we've got a nice actually I'm not
gonna talk about it you've seen it
you've seen it I'm just gonna pull it
apart and I'll talk about as I'm doing
it so let's get to it because I know you
guys are probably more interested in
seeing the PCB and all that sort of
stuff so I'll grab the required
screwdrivers okay I think I found the
screwdrivers that I need I didn't really
want to go hunting too far and wide for
them because I've really got to get on
with other things as important as these
unboxing videos are but this is an
unboxing slash teardown so we've got
like some Torx screws here so there's
one two three four five of these in the
back of the cart so we'll quickly whip
them out the back plate I wish I had a
second camera
let's about to say the back plate he's a
kind of fancy looking but then I cut my
off off yeah I wish I had a second
camera something that I came out from
the roof there but yeah I I gave my
second camera to Tim so we spent last
year fitting out his studio and his gear
I haven't really had any budget left
over time upgrade my stuff but hopefully
this year I can get a second camera so
because I don't have a cameraman and
basically if we if we've got a cameraman
and we'd probably be paying them more
than what Tim and I make combined anyway
back plate is off very easy just those
five screws and that's it so it's full
aluminium back plate covers the whole
back side of the card it's got some nice
slots for ventilation to vent any hot
air that may get trapped under it also
looks pretty stylish but that is the
back plates and we've removed that and
there is the back side of the card so
we've got some surface mount capacitors
and things pretty typical looking
backside of a graphics card and we have
what looks to be about 14 screws we'll
get the mount we'll count them once
they're out so far it's looking like
they're all the same length so that
makes this quite easy or you can just
sort them into one pile and I don't have
to worry about where they came from
so hopefully that continues we've got
four out about ten to go and these guys
are just little Phillips head screws so
pretty easy to undo imagine you've got a
small Phillips head screwdriver I've
just wrapped one randomly and it looks
like it's working
and the last one back here which I
missed we'll just get that one done and
I just did a double check of the screws
and they were actually 15 so we're up to
20 screws removed we haven't we've got
to take off this back plate for the GPU
so we'll whip that off the little
pressure clip has one of those void
warranty if removed stickers which I
don't believe a valid anymore but aim do
you've still decided to put one on there
and you had a trying to tell you from
pulling this thing apart so we've got
two screws on the i/o panel have to be
kind of careful about how I hold this
now because it could could fall apart at
any moment
I'll get those too
and then we should be good to try and
carefully pry the cooler off but so far
it's been quite easy famous last words
okay so 26 screws removed now and it
looks like we are right to try and pry
this cooler off hopefully without
damaging anything alright we've just
about got it slowly but surely and it
looks like we have a single fan here we
have two cables okay so there's the card
there's the cooler we've left some
thermal pads on the card around the
looks like they're on the power stages
yep quite a few of those so we'll put
those back on the cooler in a moment and
the thermal compound used on the GPU is
quite interesting it's not something
I've come across before seems like it
might be like one of those sort of
graphene sheet type deals I'm not really
sure that is sure they'll probably be
another reviewer that has experience
with this kind of stuff but it's not
it's not a paste so yeah I've already
tested how well this works out of the
box thermally so I'm pretty keen to
replace that with some thermal paste and
see how it compares but anyway there's
the kabbala just clean it up a bit and
we'll get some nice b-roll of it okay so
an alcohol wipe clean that up really
quick and nice or shiny ready for some
thermal paste so if you want to put a
water block on this particular model
quick and easy to do not a whole lot of
screws just sort of I would say your
typical amount of screws there was no
screws that are unusual basically a
standard screwdriver set we'll get all
those undone without a problem yeah all
very easy I didn't there's no hurdles
that I do overcome or anything like that
if you've done this before this will be
straightforward and very easy in total I
count 12 power stages so you've got 12
well actually count 14 but sorry there
are a dozen so
rounding the package and then there's
another two back here so not quite sure
how exactly it's configured how many are
for the HBM to memory and then how many
for the Radeon 7g PU but that is the
configuration of the card more details
to come in their review there's a couple
of IR controllers on there I can't tell
exactly what model they are looks like
the IR three five two one seven at least
there's one of those on the front and it
looks like there's one also on the back
bed the one on the back of the print on
it's kind of smudged on if you get a
magnifying glass for that anyway that is
the card and yeah very easy to take
apart
no odd proprietary screws that you can't
undo so that's good the cooler itself
well the shroud the nice silver shiny
bit here that is plastic so whereas the
back plate is aluminium that is plastic
so a little scratch on it whoops um but
yeah I mean that's fine that it's
plastic that doesn't really need to be
able mininum and it makes it much easier
for adding little details such as that
the radio and logo obviously lights up
so that's red and the little blockage
squarish logo thing in the corner also
lights up red at least it does from
memory I like how the the fans are all
nice and clean they look really good
obviously it's a triple fan cooler and
the aluminium heatsink it runs the
entire length of the card and you
probably get a better angle of that
there so pretty big aluminium heat sink
and a really massive copper base plate
there vapor chamber and it looks like
we've got about half a dozen copper heat
pipes at least five anyway so they're
quite large flat copper heat pipes and
they'll obviously remove the heat from
the vapor chamber and then spread it
across the card for the fans to more
effectively cool it as I cut out here
for the two eight pin power inputs and
then we've just got a single row so two
cables so this one will be for the fair
the three fans and this will be for the
the red lighting the LED lighting they
probably just clear LEDs watch LEDs and
then they'll yeah it'll look red because
of the red acrylic cutouts yeah pretty
good looking cooler that it's reasonably
heavy I'll probably provide some
detailed information about weight and
all that sort of stuff in the review
obviously how it performs all that stuff
will come in the review but yeah pretty
neat looking card very keen to see how
AMD's first consumer 7 nanometre
graphics card performs hopefully it's
good who knows we'll find out in a few
days time anyway
I think that'll do it for this quick
unboxing of the new Radeon 7gp you so
well it wasn't just an unboxing the
unboxing was probably the shortest part
of the video but we did take it out of
the official review kit if you will and
then we took it apart had a bit of a
look at it but there'll be a lot more
detail to come and information in the
review as usual I just sort of wind of
this unboxing thing and this is what we
ended up with sorry hope you enjoyed
this look at the new AMD radeon 7gp and
be sure to check out our review in a
couple of days time on the 7th so thank
you for watching I'm your host Steve see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
