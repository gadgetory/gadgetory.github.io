we're checking out my top-five best
value Intel B 360 motherboard picks for
this one it's pretty simple the boards
must feature some form of erm cooling to
be considered and of course the price is
very key here spending over $100 US on a
B 360 motherboard is ill-advised I
strongly suggest you target something
more like $80 u.s. unless there's some
sort of special requirement with that
said let's get to it
des rock be 360m pro for tix more boxes
than any other be 360 board in my
opinion and I reckon most of you will
agree with me on this one it is really
one of the best be 360 motherboards
available right now as far as B 360
pricing goes the asrock board offers
great value without $85 us I had hoped
these budget Intel coffee-like boards
would be a little more competitively
priced in any case what you get with the
B 360 M profile is a well laid out
motherboard with all the features you
could really hope for at this price
point it also doesn't hurt that the
board looks great as well and the board
packs a solid verum with premium 45 amp
chokes on a high-density glass fabric
PCB as rock advertisers support for 95
watt processes so it really shouldn't
have an issue getting the most out of a
core i7 8,700 for example a bonus here
that really should not be overlooked is
the fact that the board packs four dimm
slots and this makes future memory
upgrades a lot more cost-effective as
you just add more ddr4 modules
you also get decent audio and networking
along with 6 SATA 6 gigabits of second
ports and a pair of m2 slots over all
the asrock B 360m pro 4 is a great
quality B 360 motherboard that can't be
beat at this price point
the asou stuff be 360m a gaming is
another quality micro-atx be 360
motherboard though it does come up short
in a few areas when compared to the
asrock model we just checked out most
notably of which is the lack of DIMM
slots you do just get two dims meeting
upgrading from say 8 gigabytes to 16
gigabytes in the future will mean that
you have to get rid of the 8 gigabyte
chip all original in you gotta sell that
on the second-hand market or whatever
it's just a bit more of a hassle much
more convenient to just be able to buy 2
more 4 gigabyte sticks to expand your
memory capacity 16 gigabytes that way
the board looks quite good and it's very
game rush and aggressive as you'd
probably expect from Anasuya stuff
motherboard but the layout does leave a
bit to be desired I would have preferred
that a sous leave enough room in a
better position the SATA ports then
create that aggressive cut out looking
type PCB edge as it is the SATA port to
just spread out all over the place which
is a bit disappointing I feel still with
few good well-priced to be 360 but such
is from the tough be 360m gaming still
manages to make the list despite those
shortcomings overall quality is good
making it a worthy alternative to the
Azeroth be 360m perform
another alternative worth checking out
if you can't get your hands on the as
rock board is the gigabyte B 360 m d3h a
lot of B 360 M boards here I priced at
$80 us it is a little cheaper than the
two micro ATX boards we've already
looked at like the asou smaadahl this
gigabyte board does look very solid
though like this board there are a few
interesting choices here as well a
gigabyte has decided to include a number
of legacy items such as a PCI slot and
it was a bit of a blaster pass and I
haven't seen any new motherboard for
some time and even more ancient is the
parallel port header for those of you
that still have your printer from the
90s this could come in very handy still
it's not just the classics that you'll
find on this board a gigabyte has also
included a USB 3.1 gen2 type so there is
just a single one of those and you also
get an m2 slot that's pretty basic board
but it's also the cheapest B 360 board
that we've come across that features any
form of erm cooling and this means it
should be right to get the most out of a
core i7 8,700 and it will certainly be
the perfect pairing for a Core i5 a 400
if you're after a full sized ATX board
then there's just too cost-effective
options to choose from in the B 360
range and now the asrock be 360 pro 4
and MSI B 360 a pro who both look very
good
though the asrock model is slightly
cheaper and slightly better equipped and
therefore it gets my pick as you might
have expected it's basically an ATX
version of the micro ATX model that
we've already looked at and although the
best value ATX board on the market you
might as well just get the micro ATX
version the stretched-out
ATX model cost $10 more and apart from a
bit of extra PCB real estate and a
bigger chipset heatsink you really don't
get much for that extra investment in
fact there's only one extra PCIe x 1
slot and that's it as I see it the only
reason you'd buy this version over the
b-36 TM pro 4 that is the micro ATX
version is because you have a standard
ATX case and you want to fill that thing
out how micro ATX boards tend to look a
little silly in mid towers
for those of you who want to build a
compact little PC you'll most likely be
after something like a mini ITX
motherboard and right now that does
limit you to less than half a dozen
options it's well worth noting that the
z3 17 Mini ITX models start at 135
dollars us though most cost 170 to 180
dollars us that being the case you can
write off the Isuzu ROG Strix be 360 I'd
gaming at 160 dollars us tell them
they're dreaming picking between the
asrock be 360 MITx AC and MSI be 360 IDE
gaming Pro ac it really wasn't that easy
to be honest and I could have justified
going with the MSI model it looks like
the better board of the two and it
clearly offers a superior varium calling
but other than that they are much the
same and with the asrock board coming in
around $20 US cheaper at the moment it
is hard to ignore that saving if you can
snag the MSI model for only 5 to 10
dollars more then it's probably the way
I'd go but for $20 u.s. it really is
hard to justify that added cost
particularly given these are B 360
models for $95 us the asrock board
offers a single pcie 3.0 x 16 slot for
SATA ports for USB 3.0 reports at the
rear intel 802 11 AC Wi-Fi plus
bluetooth 4.2 and you're also get an
ultra m2 slot I can imagine this thing
inside the Silverstone SG 13 with a core
i5 8400 and that's a nice cost-effective
mini PC right there I have to say it
seems absolutely crazy to me that so
many be 360 motherboards are priced over
$100 u.s. I was at 370 boards still
available for that price and there are a
heap of them for around 120 dollars u.s.
you have to wonder why anyone would
spend that kind of money on an inferior
be 360 board for example the msi be 360
gaming plus that I checked out only
launch day and that costs a hundred and
ten dollars u.s. the gigabyte be 360 or
is gaming 3 and the asrock be 360 gaming
k4 they both cost 120 dollars u.s.
unbelievably the Asuza
ROG Strix be 360 F
comes in 135 dollars us oh and there is
the B 3 6 th Gary model for a hundred
and fifty five dollars us so I suppose
you get that if you're completely
bonkers it is worth noting the cheapest
models still cost $70 u.s. and well who
do leave a lot to be desired the $80 to
$85 micro-atx models featured in this
video really as good as it gets in my
opinion I recommend these motherboards
for those of you buying some like a
locked core i5 processor they are you
480 500 even 3600 but those of you
picking up the $300 u.s. core i7 8700
you really should pony up the extra $20
also for is ed 370 boy in my opinion as
for the H 310 models they're certainly
better suited to core i3 in lower parts
but honestly with prices starting at $60
u.s. you really have to question why
they even exist at all anyway if you're
after a good value B 360 board then I
