hey guys welcome back to harbor unbox
for the start of my Computex 2017
coverage but before I jump into that a
quick word about our sponsor MSI firstly
big thanks to MSI for bringing me here
issue I wouldn't be here without them if
you're in the market for new Intel
motherboard check out the new x99 Zed
270 + h2 70 motherboards right now
they're offering a free you play game
key for any new purchase link is in the
video description right so I arrived in
Taiwan last night and met up with my
good mate Brian from tech city somehow
Brian managed to smooth talk the Grand
Hyatt reception into letting him check
in for me a few hours before I even made
it into the country and now my rooms in
Brian's name and I have a squatter I
can't get rid of even if I could get rid
of him though I'm not sure what I'd do
with all the used parts scattered all
over the room
so rule one of Computex don't tell the
yes-man which hotel you're staying at
anyway since I'm now stuck with Brian I
can use these services as a cameraman
he's not too bad at that today
everybody's still sitting up so we've
just been walking around and checking
the place out so far though it's been a
lot of fun
that's before we did anything too
serious we headed down to the ground
floor for the breakfast buffet and he
made sure we got our money's worth the
food though is absolutely amazing and
looking forward to starting every day
the same way next up we hit the street
in search of the media registration
booth I haven't run into any famous
youtubers other than Brian of course but
hopefully I'll come across some of the
really big names soon after waiting
about 20 minutes or so to get registered
I ended up with the name Hardware
Australia pretty close I'd guess and
Brian walked away with tech city media
prod we then decided to have a bit of a
look around the Taipei World Trade
Centre and I have to say on Monday
morning it was a very busy place for
those of you wondering and maybe you're
unfamiliar with Computex this is just a
small section of hall 1 and Hall 1 is
the largest of three buildings the good
news for us being that Hall 1 and Hall
to a right next to the Grand Hyatt Hotel
so we don't have to travel too far
before we left Brian I had a quick look
around
the worksite that said though I'm pretty
sure we were meant to find our way onto
the showroom floor but we did and I'm
also quite sure we weren't meant to film
anything but of course we did
Brian reckons the keys to look important
so I'm not sure what that looks like but
it got us through security without any
issues anyway with just one more day
till the showroom floor opens the public
there looks to be a heck of a lot of
work that still needs to be done but
they'll probably get it done they seem
to each year we didn't end up checking
out Hall two or three but they're most
certainly just as busy over there as
well setting up booths after our quick
little explore we headed back to the
hotel where we discovered in video
setting up on the third floor we thought
why not sneak in and do a bit of filming
in here as well unfortunately though we
didn't get too far before security
escorted us out apparently they're still
setting up and obviously we didn't look
important enough who were thought before
we left though Brian jumped at the
opportunity to look like a bit of a
fanboy he's still trying to give me
grief over picking the RX 580 over the
gtx 1060 I have to say real-life trolls
are the worst as for tomorrow we have a
few things planned first of all of
course be the msi booth since they
brought us here and apparently had some
cool new gear for us to check out so
that should be interesting I'll do my
best to try and snag a GeForce GT 1030
graphics card from them so I can compare
that with the rx 550 heaps of you guys
have been asking me to do that so that's
something I want to put together once I
get home I'm also keen to try and walk
away with the tomahawk be 350 board I
hear that's a particularly good be 350
board and again you guys have been
hounding me to do a review on it
there'll probably be two videos tomorrow
so make sure you check them out so you
can find out what I've been up to and
before I wrap things up we did announce
the winners of the AOC giveaway today on
the tech lounge so here's a quick look
at that and give you guys the details on

just like to say that editing encoding
on that msi phantom laptop that i looked
at last week has gone really well so far

looking after me
I got to say having a 40 inch laptop is
fantastic for use on the plane trip over

layover anyway guys thanks for watching
