it's going to become a very dominant
force in the SSD industry in the early
days with their vertex and agility SSDs
unfortunately the company is never able
to ward off reliability issues and this
played a key role in their demise which
came in the form of Toshiba purchasing
the company in early 2014
since then under the control of Toshiba
we've seen a few new products come out
overseas said there are truth be told
none of them have really been stellar
last year we reviewed the try them on
hundreds first ocz SSD to feature both
the Toshiba controller and a 19 TLC NAND
flash memory the bar for TLC SSDs was
set by Samsung in 2012 but frankly that
bar was set very high as a company that
develops everything in-house Samsung is
a massive advantage when it comes to new
technologies because this controller and
NAND teams can collaborate in a way
that's not possible for other companies
thanks to its parent company OSI said
was now in a similar situation but
unfortunately they weren't able to
deliver a package the key rival Samsung
has already established Evo series the
initial MSRP was far too high though
OSes that was able to correct this
before long today the 480 gigabyte RAM
100 cost $150 which is roughly the same
price at the 850 Evo 500 gigabyte model
regrettably even with competitive
pricing the Tri 100 can't hold a candle
to the 850 Evo performance and even
worse is the reliability my tri 100 is
still going strong though I must admit
it seemed very little used in the time
I've had it and user reports online a
very damning for example on newegg.com
the majority of user reviews complain
about failures just 38% of all users
were happy with the drives with 42%
giving the lowest score possible and now
it's all set the drive died within a few
weeks or months I've only had my try on
150 for a few days now it's impossible
to gauge how reliable not just my unit
is but this series as a whole moving
past the reliability concerns
what is the try 150 bring to the tables
as the name suggests the try 150 is an
incremental upgrade as the shifts focus
from to sheave is a 19 nanometer TLC to
there 15 nanometers TLC other than the
adoption of this technology the rest of
the specifications go unchanged the 480
GUI model that I have in hand boasts the
same 550 megabytes per second read speed
and 530 megabytes per second write
speeds the endurance still sees the
total bytes written rating of 120
terabytes which equates to 110 gigabytes
per day over the three-year warranty
with the specifications being largely
unchanged let's jump into the benchmark
results the try 150 greatly improves the
read and write access time of the
previous model and provides the best
results yet making it faster than even
the Samsung SSD 850 Pro the try 150
provided the same read performance as
the try and 100 largely due to the
limitations of the starter interface the
write performance on the other hand was
slightly improved and now matched the
Samsung SSD 850 Pro and Kingston HyperX
savage this graph is arranged by read
result and interestingly the try 150 was
slower than the previous model this is
despite what can only be described as a
truly massive jump in performance when
looking at the right results here the
try 150 sustained 494 megabytes per
second making one of the fastest SATA
SSDs tested and much faster than to the
trial 100 the random 4k performance
tryam 150 is slightly improved over the
previous model while the read
performance was actually very strong the
right result was lacking behind the
competition although the try 150 was
technically faster than the try 100 in
the pc mac video edition tests it's fair
to say the two megabytes per second
increase is negligible at best
unfortunately this means while faster
than the trial 100 in Kingston HyperX
savage the try 150 is still considerably
slower than the bulk of its competition
this time the try 150 was slightly
slower than the savage and although it
did provide a reasonable performance
gain over the try
100 it was still much slower than the
Samsung SSD 850 Evo and crucial drives
for example the original trial 100
didn't perform particularly well in the
PC mark 8 storage benchmarks and frankly
the try 150 is a much better
granted did outperform the Kingston
HyperX savage though it was over 30%
slower than the Samsung SSD 850 Evo when
it comes to serial ata SSDs these days
particularly these TLC based models it's
all about pricing and reliability
performance is now less of a concern for
a few reasons firstly the limits of
serial ata is 6 gigabits per second bus
we reach quite some time ago now so with
the exception of small random
transactions there isn't a great deal to
improve on secondly there is looking to
invest in a TLC base SSD usually coming
from a hard drive even the slowest
modern SSDs of worlds faster than the
fastest hard drive that said this is a
trial 150 years more than many able
mechanical drives to worry about already
in the TLC space with the tried and true
samsung SSD 850 Evo as well as crucial
zone BS 200 series looking at prices
they're all quite evenly matched the try
150 480 gigabyte model that we reviewed
here currently cost $140 so just 29
cents per gigabyte this makes it around
10 dollars cheaper than the previous
model which is great this also makes the
trial 150 480 gigabyte model around 8%
cheaper than the 850 Evo 500 though keep
in mind samsung slightly larger capacity
means it works out to be roughly the
same price at 30 cents per gigabyte
this makes the trial 150 a tough sell
indeed as it's clearly inferior to the
850 Evo in terms of performance and
endurance the only 50 Evo has also been
selling for over a year now and user
reviews are overwhelmingly positive
the crucial BX 200 is another option at
a cost of just 27 cents per gigabyte for
the 480 gigabyte model
crucial sacrifice performance surprise
of their BX 200 series and frankly I
don't think the performance here is
worth a few cents to save per gigabyte
overall the try and 150 is another
disappointing offering they come out of
the OCS out into sheer bird
collaboration given the horrible
reliability track record of trying 100
wouldn't be confident investing the
trial 150 this new series certainly has
a lot to prove the next six to 12 months
let me know what you think about OCS
dad's new trial 150 SSD do you think I'm
being too harsh or do you agree with my
comments also if you've been using the
trial 100 please share your experience
with us on our forum to a hardware box
calm thanks for watching and don't
forget to hit like and subscribe on your
way out
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
