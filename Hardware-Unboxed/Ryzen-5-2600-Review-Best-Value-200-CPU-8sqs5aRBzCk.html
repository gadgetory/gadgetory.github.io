you're all doing well and you're not
sick of sick and Gen rising content just
yet because today we have more hurt for
you as the titles no doubt given away we
are checking out the horizon five twenty
six hundred and we'll be taking it for a
spin on the impressive new a soos ROG
crosshair seven hero it's a $300 us x4
seventy board with all the bells and
whistles it has to be said though that
the horizon 526 hour is probably better
suited to something like the ROG strict
x4 7f gaming or the prime X 470 Pro
given that it is a $200 u.s. processor
but 2600 is $30 cheaper than the 2600 X
that we looked at last week and that 13%
saving sees the operating clock speeds
reduced by 6 to 7 percent while the box
cooler has been downgraded from the
array aspire to the dinky little ray of
stealth and we'll check out how that
performs later in the video the real
competition though comes from the blue
team's coffee-like core i5 range in
particular the core i5 8400 which comes
in almost twenty dollars or less I'm not
a huge saving but does make it a little
more affordable there are eyes in 520
600 does have two distinct advantages
though firstly it can be overclocked and
pushing all calls past four gigahertz
shouldn't be a problem
meanwhile the core i5 8400 is limited to
an all core frequency of 3.8 gigahertz
however perhaps the biggest advantage is
the fact that 2600 is a six core 12
thread processor thanks to the inclusion
of SMT support 3400 lacks Intel
hyper-threading technology meaning it's
a six-course 6 thread CPU and this will
hand arisin a serious advantage in core
heavy workloads AMD has really been
aggressive for pricing on the second gen
rising cpus last year the Rison 5 1600
launched at 220 dollars us though it has
to be said for most of 2017 it did sell
for less than that and then in early
2018 it was officially discounted to
$190 us so that means when compared to
the discounter price the 2600 is coming
in at just a fraction more than the
older 1600
apart from improved IPC performance
greater efficiency reduced cache latency
enhanced memory latency and frequency
support the 2600 also comes clocked 6 to
8
at higher than the 1600 out of the box
then like the rest of the horizon light
the 2600 is also an unlocked CPU so
reaching and even exceeding the stock
2600 X performance shouldn't be an issue
so for our test setup just a quick recap
on that in case you missed the last 32
minute long review on the 2600 X 120 700
X all data has been updated for the
release of the second gen Rison CPUs
this means all data is fresh and has
been gathered in the past two weeks all
testing was done with the latest drivers
Windows updates motherboard BIOS updates
game and application updates and
security updates yes the latest specter
and meltdown updates have been applied
throughout the testing we're looking at
stock out-of-the-box performance as well
as overclocking the first generalising
CPUs have been overclocked to 4
gigahertz while I was able to get the
2600 X stable at 4.1 gigahertz and the
2700 X at 4.2 gigahertz the non X 2600
though was able to boot in the windows
and complete a number of tests including
Cinebench r15 s multi-threaded test at
4.3 gigahertz using the same 1.37 5
volts that limited the 2600 extra just
for point 1 gigahertz unfortunately
though cranking the voltage right up
still was enough to allow us to
stabilize the overclock at four point
three gigahertz particularly for our
heavy blender workload and we were
forced back down a 4.2 gigahertz
something else worth noting was that the
2600 would suffer the dreaded blue
screen of death when using our g.skill
sniper X ddr4 3400 CL 16 memory the
integrated controller just doesn't seem
to be as good as what we found with the
2600 X and 2700 X therefore I switched
to G skills flair exterior for 3200 CL
14 memory you don't really sacrifice
much with this lower frequency memory
due to the tighter timings this
integrated memory controller issue could
just be a problem with my chip or it
could be more widespread with all of the
non ex models time will tell anyway
enough chitchat let's get to the good
stuff first up here's a quick look at
sustained memory performance and as you
can see the lower latency CL 14 memory
actually edges out the higher clock ddr4
3400 sells 16 memory used by the 2600 X
so despite using lower clocked memory
the Rison 5 2600 shouldn't be at a
disadvantage with the bandwidth creeping
just
there were 39 gigabytes per second it's
got plenty to play with
moving on to Cinebench r15 we see the
2600 trails the 2600 x by six percent
margin for both d single and multi
threaded tests still out of the box that
was able to mimic the core i7 7 or X and
improved on the older Eisen 5 1600
single thread score by a 9% margin and
the multi threads score by an impressive
12 percent margin overclocked it was
able to edge out the slightly inferior
2600 X chip and I mean inferior in the
sense that it only managed to get to 4.1
gigahertz I suspect though we did get a
poor chip it seems like we have a
similar situation to the 1600 and 1600 X
with the new 2,600 and 2,650 Hertz next
up we have the PC mark 10 video editing
results and here we can see it these
stock risin 5 2600 scores 4901 points
which placed it only ahead of the r5
1600 but also just 2% behind these stock
2600 X and core i7 700 X overclocked to
4.2 gigahertz the score jumped up by 12%
to reach 5,500 nine points and that's
almost on par with the 330 dollar rise
in 720 700 X so that's an exceptional
result for the 2600 this time with the
PC mark gaming test we see that when
compared to the horizon 5 1600 the 2600
was 8% faster a litter box and 7% faster
once both CPUs were overclocked to the
max overclocked the 2600 also matched
the horizon 7 1800 X though doodle
reduction in cause was 9% slower than
the 2,700 X firing up Excel for some
spreadsheet action we see the 2600 took
just 3.1 seconds to complete the
workload when stock and just 2.6 seconds
once overclocked that means with both
these 1600 and 2600 overclocked to the
max the new second journal completed the
workload 11% quicker for compression and
decompression work for 2600 is 11% fast
and the 1600 which is a seriously
impressive improvement this puts it
almost on par with the core i7 700 X a
CPU that costs almost twice as much then
moving on we find the 2600 deep trail
the 700
it's by a rather large margin for our
handbrake test though once overclocked
if you rapidly close in of course you
can still overclock for similar X and
look at those results in a future video
overall though this is still a great
result for AMD and we see the 2600 is
easily able to beat the 77 and Kate
clocked at 5 gigahertz running the
corona benchmark we see that out of the
box the risin 5 2600 and core i7 700 X
are comparable which again bodes well
for this significantly more affordable
AMD CPU moving on to the blender results
and we see here that the 2600 needs to
be clocked at 4.2 gigahertz in order to
beat the stock core i7 a 1700 X still it
is worth noting that before overclocking
the 2600 is still fast in the core i7
7700 K which was clocked at 5 gigahertz
so in terms of value it is still very
impressive the v-ray benchmark shows the
stock risin 520 600 shaving 11% off the
render time when compared to the r5 1600
in fact overclocked to the max the r5
1600 is able to roughly match the stock
2600 meanwhile overclocking the second
gen rising CP reduced the render time by
a further 13% allowing it to complete
the test in 89 seconds for content
creators on a budget the horizon 520 600
should it be a hot item as you can
achieve 8600 K light performance at a
more affordable price even at 5.20
gigahertz the 8600 K is only a fraction
faster not this frequency does require
expensive cooling and addy lid though
please note our chip hasn't been deleted
and therefore does run extremely hot I
was really impressed to see that even
when editing the 2600 is comparable to
the higher clocked 8600 K so appears to
have no real weakness and is
considerably better than the first
generalising v 1600 for these types of
lightly threaded workloads and of course
that is down to the fact that it runs at
a higher frequency when only using one
or two cause okay so now it's time to do
some gaming and first that we have ashes
of the singularity running with the
DirectX 12 API the rise in cpus would
fare a lot better in this title with a
radio and GPU as we've shown a number of
times in the past unfortunately though
right now AMD just doesn't have anything
competitive in the high end so it makes
more
since the test with the GT x 1080 TI of
course we would like to test with both
it's just not possible due to time and
all that sort of stuff anyway in the
case of the horizon 520 600 it's still
very respectable and overclocked edges
at the stock 77 okay and 78 her ex it's
also not a great deal slower than the
eight core 1800 X and 2700 X moving on
to Assassin's Creed origins using the
higher quality preset and we see at the
2600 is only slightly faster than the
1600 out of the box that said unlike the
1600 it does see a decent performance
bump once overclocked though something
is limiting the AMD CPUs to around 98
fps in this title perhaps that could be
the envy display driver not a hundred
percent sure on that one it's something
I'll have to look into overclocked the
Rison v 2600 is able to roughly match
the horizon 720 700 X in battlefield one
and that meant that it was eight percent
faster than the 1600 maxed out at four
gigahertz so a decent step forward here
for AMD especially at the $200 price
point reducing the GPU bottleneck by
reducing the battlefield one quality
preset to the medium setting and does
allow the overclocked 8700 KNAT 600 K to
run away with it it's still before we
overclock the 2600 allowed for over 100
FPS at all times anyway playing far cry
5 the overclocked 2600 basically matched
the overclocked 2700 X and this made it
one of the fastest rising CPUs we've
ever tested in this title although it
does trail the coffee lake and KB lag
CPUs with a hundred fps or more it's
still getting the job done nicely
interestingly the six core eyes and CPUs
do lag behind a little for the one
percent low result in our 12 player bot
match and while overclocking the 2600
does help here it still reaches the
overwatch frame cap moving on we have
vermintide 2 and here we see with the
extreme quality preset at Tony peeve the
horizon 5 2600 can almost get the most
out of the GTX 1080i overclocked it was
just 12 percent so old nearly 700 K 9600
K both of which were overclocked to 5.2
gigahertz reducing the GPU bottleneck
with the medium quality preset does once
again allow the Intel CPUs to run away
with it making them a better
for high refresh rate gaming as I've
noted in the past then moving on to
power consumption here we're measuring
the peak total system consumption using
the Quebec power mode like the core i5
8400 and rise and 5 1600 the 2600 sips
of very little power in our ashes of the
singularity benchmark and nearly drove
total system consumption to just 370
watts overclocked we see an 11% increase
to 411 watts which is really a great
result for AMD for 2600 again matched
the risin 5 1600 this time during 345
watts and we see a 12% increase once
overclocked which is still less than the
amount of power a stock 7800 extras here
we see with the blender workload the
2600 draws less power than the 1600 and
again overclocked still consumes less
power than a stock core i7 7800 X the
handbreak results they were a bit of an
eye-opener honestly I was expecting to
see more results that looked a bit like
this when overclocking because usually
we see overclocking just throwing
efficiency out the window prior to any
overclocking the 2600 is extremely
efficient however once we overclock it
for this benchmark total system
consumption climbed by 88% and the only
chance we might have ever seen a worse
result here would be if I overclocked
the 7800 X finally we have the Premier
encode results and here the overclocked
2600 increased total system consumption
by just 28% considering the 8600 case or
a 32% increase once overclocked that's a
decent result for the second gen rise in
CPU now let's talk temperatures for
testing we maintained an ambient air
temperature of 21 to 22 degrees and the
azuz ROG crosshair 7 hero along with the
risin v 2600 and its box cooler were
placed in our coarser crystal 570 X ATX
test system under these conditions the
Wraith stealth kept the r5 2600 74
degrees our blender stress test
moving on to gaming we found under heavy
load with utilization hovering between
80 and 90% the temperatures peaked at
just 63 degrees and during more typical
loads
drop down to 59 degrees so for stock
performance the little wraith stealth
does quite a good job it's also very
quiet
for our 4.2 gigahertz overclock we did
strap on the Corsair H 150 I Pro and
this saw a pic temperature when running
an hour long blender workload reach to
67 degrees then when gaming we saw
temperatures peak at 56 degrees but it
is worth noting that for the most part
they were below 50 degrees as for
overclocking with the Box cooler I was
able to reach 4 gigahertz using one
point to 3 volts but did hit a
temperature of 87 degrees in our blender
stress test after an hour for gaming you
could afford to push things a little
further but if you're doing any kind of
heavy workloads 4 gigahertz is probably
the limit here finally for those of you
wondering stock the risin 5 2600 holds
on all core clock speed of 3 point 6 5
gigahertz using the wraith stealth box
cooler then upgrading to the h 150 i pro
saw the all call frequency jump up to
three point seven five gigahertz for the
intense hour-long stress test we found
the same 100 megahertz increase for the
2600 X and 2700 X when upgrading from
the included box coolers last year I
declared the risin 5 1600 as the best
value CP on the market now whether
you're a gamer or you've actually got
some real work to do
if you rivaled what the 1600 had to
offer at the $200 u.s. price point of
course the core i5 8400 is an attractive
option and arguably the better gaming
CPU certainly for today's games but when
it comes to core heavy workloads the
1600 just ran away with it and for that
reason I really felt that it was the
better all-rounder now we have the
horizon 520 600 and it's offering I
suppose what you could call it
incremental upgrade to the previous
model and really that's probably all it
had to do for those that bought a rise
in 5 1600 earlier this year or last year
well they're not going to be upgrading
to the 2600 they'll probably even hold
off on jumping to the 2700 X but for
those of you who are building a new PC
now you have the choice between a coffee
like Core i5 or a second-generation 5
processor and this incremental update
has really helped make horizon are more
attractive than it was previously the
2600 is also a nice upgrade option for
those who purchased a quad core first
generation processor the only
disappointing aspect of the rival 520
600 is the fact
AMD downgraded the bundle to only
include the Wraith stealth cooler if
only the Wraith spire was included but
for that you will need to pony up an
extra $30 us for the 2600 X model
AMD has been a bit smarter this time
around with the ex models still the 2600
is 13% cheaper and was at most 7 percent
slower so in terms of value it is still
the more cost effective option
as for the Isuzu ROG cross s7 hero it's
a seriously nice X 470 motherboard and
with the latest bios version 509 I
worked like a charm
of course as I said earlier in the
review it's better suited to use with
sake Rison 7 models for the 2600 i'd
recommend something like the Isuzu prime
x4 70 pro or the tough x4 70 + gaming
hopefully I can check those board out
for you guys in a future video at the
time of putting this video together the
horizon 520 600 sat in 23rd position on
Amazon's bestseller list while the
horizon 720 700 exclaimed second spot
behind the 8700 K and the r5 1600 was
one position from standing on the podium
in fourth it's pretty shocking to see
how far back the r5 2600 currently is
but that might have to do with AMD
refusing to supply samples or even let
retailers hand them over to us under
embargo ahead of the release they
obviously wanted their more expensive EX
models front and center personally
though I do prefer the cheaper Rison 5
2600 to the more expensive 2600 X as I'd
be upgrading the cooler regardless of
which version I purchased and the low
latency ddr4 3200 memory seems like the
way to go but let me hand this one over
to you guys which model appears to be
best for you
