I'm your host Matt and today we've got
the first look at the geforce gtx 950
graphics card in videos new gtx 950 is
the new $150 GPU on the block
codenamed g 206 it's based on the same
axle design as the gtx 960 this means
the die size and the transistor count
match that of the gtx 960 what has been
changed as the core configuration which
says 25% of the cuda cores and texture
units disabled in total there are 768
single precision cuda cores 48 texture
units and 32 are aps unfortunately this
means the gtx 950 shares the same
achilles heel a dismal 128 bit memory
bus trumps buy the radeon r7 370 is 256
bit memory bus gtx 950 is nearest
competitor this means that the gtx 950
has a little over 40% less memory
bandwidth by comparison where the gtx
960 featured a 1127 megahertz core base
clock the gtx 950 you'll run 9% slower
at a thousand and 24 megahertz with a
boost clock speed of 1188 megahertz
the gddr5 memory is also 6 percent
slower at 1650 megahertz
the thermal design power rating is just
90 watts for the gtx 950 and if video
suggests that the game was lonely near
the 350 watt power supply having said
that let's go and see what the gtx 950
produces in the real world we're gonna
be benchmarking in 1080p let's see how
it performs the gtx 950 gets off to a
great start in Assassin's Creed unity
has managed to healthy 35 frames per
second edging out the r7 370 by a couple
of frames and 10 frames behind the gtx
960 in call of duty advanced warfare the
950 perform well again managed 94 frames
per second which was 22% more than the
r7 370 that said it was also 22% slower
than the GTX 960 next opera Crysis 3
results with both the GTX 760 and 960
where
to beat the 950 again it eclipses the r7
370 but only by a couple of frames the
950 perform well again in dying light
managing 40 frames per second this was
just 5 frames per second shy the GTX 960
but an impressive 9 frames faster than
the r7 370 in f1 2015 the GTX 950 was
able to match the GTX 760 again with 52
frames per second apiece the r7 370 was
just 3 frames per second behind and the
GTX 960 scored 12 frames more with 64
the results in GTA 5 were very similar
to f1 2015 the 950 and 760 were
neck-and-neck at 82 frames per second
10% ahead of the r7 370 and 15% behind
the GTX 960 in battlefield hardline the
results were again similar this time the
760 edged out the 950 by single frame
and the r7 370 was just shy of 16%
behind the GTX 960 was 20% faster in
this test the 950 overclocked well
reaching 1284 megahertz without any
additional voltage that's a massive 25%
overclock the gddr5 memory reached 1778
megahertz which was a decent eight
percent overclock and that frequency
surpassed the gtx 960 before jumping to
the overclocking results I'd like to
just mention that when overclocked the
zotac gtx 950 never exceeded 74 degrees
and at the stop frequencies peaked at 71
degrees testing with middle-earth we
found that the overclocked gtx 950 was
now able to match the r7 370 with 36
frames per second and even more
impressively was just two frames slower
than the GTX 960 in f1 2015 the
overclocked 950 was just three frames
per second slower than the gtx 960 with
61 frames per second this was an
impressive 9 frames per second
improvement plating at 12 frames per
second ahead of the r7 370 and call of
duty advanced warfare the overclocked
950 was again able to match the
performance of the gtx 960 with a
hundred and thirty frames per second
this is also again 9 frames per second
faster than the 950 and a pretty
significant 47% faster than the r7 370
this is where the Maxwell architecture
has been the most impressive when
looking at power consumption the GTX 950
was often found matching the GTX 760 yet
we see a rather large 20% reduction in
power consumption the entire system
which includes the core i7 4970 k
processor and geforce gtx 950 GPU
consume just 171 watts in plain daylight
this is why a video recommends a power
supply with a 350 watt output the 950
results was surprisingly good better
than expected on pay for the 950 should
be around 25% slower than the 960 and in
reality the results were much closer
than that
we found in our tests that the 950 was
an average just 17 percent slower than
the 960 which was quite impressive more
surprising was the fact that the 950 on
average was 45 percent faster than the
750 Ti the 950 only features 20% more
CUDA cores for combine that with the 20%
greater memory bandwidth and things
start to weigh heavily in the 1950s
favor when compared to the r7 370 we
found that the 950 provide 11% better
gaming performance the 950 also
overclocked really well without
adjusting the voltage and temperatures
remain relatively low coming in price at
150 dollars we can no doubt expect to
see AMD slash the price of the r7 370
and introduce the faster 370 ex at the
same price point this is Ben math aha
brown box let me know what you think in
