today's video we are looking into which
one of AMD's new risin five six core
CPUs you should buy assuming you're in
the market for a new CPU price between
200 and 250 dollars u.s. now I realize
that for some of you the answer might
seem obvious and I did suggest in my day
one coverage just a few days ago now
that you should in fact buy the plane 9
X 1600 model unfortunately I didn't have
a 1600 chip on hand for a release day
coverage so I couldn't go into too much
detail or speak from experience I just
assumed based on we had seen with
Verizon 7 that the 1600 would overclock
nearly as well as the 1600 X therefore
in terms of performance the 1600 X and
1600 should be very evenly matched the
advantage of the 1600 being that it
comes bundled with a 95 watt cooler
known as the Wraith spire well the 1600
X doesn't come with a cooler at all so
once you factor in the cost of a basic
air cooler for the 1600 X model the non
x version is more like 20% cheaper and
out of the box it shouldn't be more than
10% slower worst case so what makes the
1600 X X rated the answer xf r or if you
like to drive people crazy refer to it
as extended frequency range every chance
you get essentially xf r is a beefed-up
version of the standard turbo frequency
feature basically various limiters such
as power current and thermals are all in
within acceptable ranges the CPU will
overclock itself a little harder this is
a feature that is enabled on the ex
model C if you use by default ironically
one way to disable xf r is to manually
overclock the CPU but i'll discuss that
a bit more in a moment the 1600 x
features a base clock speed of 3.6 ago a
boost clock of 4 gigahertz and a maximum
x FR boost speed of 4.1 gigahertz that
said those figures on their own or a
little misleading the boost frequencies
for example only allow the 1600 to get 4
to 4.1 gigahertz for single-thread
workloads for multi-threaded workloads
the CPU won't actually boost higher than
3.7 gigahertz so a mere 3% increase over
the base frequency the 1600 on the other
hand operated a base clock frequency of
just 3.2 gigahertz and it's advertised
to boost aside
is 3.6 years so again that boost
frequency will only be achieved when
taxing a single core I mentioned that
the advertised maximum boost frequency
is 3.6 gigahertz
however stressing a single core in most
cases see the 1600 exhibit excel file
like games hitting 3.7 gigahertz so
that's interesting it seems like all
Rison cpus do actually feature XFR
finally the maximum multi-core frequency
is 3.4 gigahertz so that means the heavy
workloads the 1600 is clocked just 8%
lower than the 1600 X now as I mentioned
earlier none of this really matters if
you plan to overclock
and since all rising CPUs are unlocked
and the 1600 can be pushed quite hard
with the Wraith spire box cooler
certainly worth looking into we already
know that if you don't plan to overclock
the 1600 X is the fastest CPU as it's
clocked higher but the 1600 is actually
better value whichever way you plan to
go because it can only be 10% slower and
yet at least 20% more affordable thanks
to the included Box cooler and lower
price tag but when it comes time to
overclock
does the 1600 X offer more Headroom
rumor is the X models are been chips
capable of greater frequencies and we
have seen a little evidence of this with
the 1700 X and 1700 chips though for the
most part the margins were very small
the 1600 X chip that I have had no
trouble hitting 4.1 gigahertz with just
one point three eight volts and it was
even possible to benchmark the system at
4.2 gigahertz though that required an
i/o ordering 1.5 volts
AMD recommends a maximum of one point
four five volts for sustained use using
the same one point three eight volts the
1600 was limited to four gigahertz which
isn't bad and increasing the voltage of
fraction more to one point four allowed
us to achieve a stable overclock of 4050
megahertz so that's just 50 megahertz
shy of what the 1600 X managed of course
this could very easily have gone the
other way I just happened to receive a
very good 1600 X I've seen plenty of
reviewers and now some users limited to
4 gigahertz with the 1600 X so as always
with overclocking your mileage will vary
that said I would expect almost all to
hit at least four gigahertz for single
thread workloads the overclock won't
actually be any faster than the
the box 4.1 gigahertz xfr performance so
multi-threaded performance the 1600 X
will be up to 11% faster while the 1600
X will be up to 21% faster that being
said let's take a quick look at some
benchmarks and I really do mean a quick
look this isn't an in-depth rising 5
1600 review in fact it's not a review at
all that will come later along with the
quad-core 1400 model something I should
note right away is that even with G
skills new Flair X ddr4 3200 CL 14
memory the horizon 5 1600 was limited to
running the memory at 29 33 this is the
same limitation we faced with the 1500 X
so high-speed memory support is still
very dependent on the CPU this will hand
the 1600 X a slight advantage over the
advantage it already has due to those
higher clock speeds in any case even
with ddr4 29:33 memory the 1600 was
still good for a memory throughput of 35
gigabytes per second using Cinebench r15
to measure single and multi-threaded
performance we see that the 1600 X is
10% faster for the multi-threaded test
and 11% faster for the single thread
test this is about what we would expect
to see out of the box
remember the 1600 X is clocked 11%
higher for single thread workloads and
9% higher thumb multitrader workloads so
these figures make sense here we have
some results based on a real application
7-zip both the compression and
decompression tests use all available
threads on the 1600 X and 1600 here the
1600 X was around 7 or 8 percent faster
than the 1600 so those figures are in
line with what we just saw previously in
Cinebench and again given the
out-of-the-box clock speed these are the
margins that we would expect to see
testing gaming performance with hitman
we find the 1600 x is just 4 percent
faster than the 1600 when comparing
either the average or minimum frame
rates obviously not a significant
performance difference and this does
explain why we didn't see any worthwhile
performance gains in most games when
overclocking rise and ashes of the
singularity escalation is the only other
game I tested with to compare the 1600
and 1600 X this time we see a mere 2 to
3 percent performance advantage in favor
of the 1600 X so again it looks like
when it comes to gaming spending more on
the 1600 X is a poor return on
investment now when overclocking these
Rison 5 CPUs we find that for
which is equalized the 1600 fell just 50
megahertz shy of the 1600 X when using
reasonable voltages this is obviously a
negligible difference and as you can see
both CPUs led the Titan X big P to
average 88 FPS so as we suspected the
rise in v 1600 is the obvious choice
here in a nutshell for 250 dollars us
you can get the 1600 X and a mostly
empty box with the 1600 though you paid
220 us you get a bigger box and this
time it's not empty inside you'll find
the nice big erase spire cooler so throw
the 1600 and the included cooler on an
affordable be 350 motherboard then pair
it with something like G skills flare X
ddr4 2400 16 gigabyte memory kit
overclock the memory as high as you can
29:33 should be possible with relaxed
timings and then overclock the CPU to 4
you hurt and you're set all up you have
the core components for a killer 6 chord
12 thread rig for no more than 400 us
hmm
how much does Intel's Core i7 6000 okay
Costigan yeah looking at it that way
there are eyes in 5 1600 is exceptional
value as I found earlier this week even
when compared to the more affordable CPU
such as the core i5 7600 K the new 6
core Verizon CPUs are a much better buy
regardless of what it is you plan to do
with the system however there's not much
reason for anyone to purchase the 1600 X
over the 1600 as you're just paying more
for less you might be wondering then why
am they would release a 1600 X type
product at all and I'd say it exists
simply to maximize profit AMD is playing
a similar game to Intel here with these
chips the difference of course being
that they are doing it without
completely taking advantage of
enthusiasts who want to save a little
money when it comes to 1600 you're being
rewarded for doing your homework and a
little tinkering ok so that concludes
this video I hope it's clear now why you
guys should be buying a regular Rison v
1600 processor over the more flashy
sounding 1600 X as I mentioned earlier I
will be covering the 1600 in more detail
soon and I'll also be checking out the
budget quad core Verizon v 1400 as well
the 1400 model will be compared with the
core i5 7400 and core i3 70 350 K and I
might even try to throw in the ultra
affordable G 45 60 as well
all at some point I'll also be testing
their eyes in five CPUs and the
competing Intel chips in a wide range of
games using not just the ultra-fast gtx
1080i which does help point to future
performance but will also be testing
with some more realistic configurations
as well using the gtx 1070 1060 and our
X 480 I also plan to revisit rise in
memory performance I recently checked
out of Verizon does indeed benefit from
faster clocked memory the idea really
wasn't CF rise and scaled better than
say KB Lake with faster memory and the
short answer is no it doesn't the
reasons I'm going to revisit this topic
though is to show you guys if you
actually need to spend money on the
premium ddr4 3,200 memory or should you
just save and get the 2,400 stuff I did
see nice gains from the faster memory
but remember I was using the GTX 1080i
so things might be very different with
the GTX 1060 for example finally I'm
also working on the side to complete the
second half of that is it worth buying
GPU video the first half looked at the
GTX 970 while part two we'll focus on
the r9 390 the results so far for the
AMD GPU are very impressive so I want to
try and get that one done next week
I'll see how I go for time no doubt a
few more things will pop up in the
meantime I should also have a few board
partner versions of the mighty gtx 980ti
coming in the next week or so so that's
exciting as usual things never seem to
slow down alright guys I'm going to go
on and get out of you now before I think
of anything else I hope you enjoyed
today's video I'm your host Steve catch
again soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
