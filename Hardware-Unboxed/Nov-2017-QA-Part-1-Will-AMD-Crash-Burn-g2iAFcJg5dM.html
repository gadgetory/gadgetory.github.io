a lot of them I don't know how long the
video ended up being but pretty long
yeah pretty long yeah anyway thanks for
watching and I'm gonna hand it over to
Tim and I guess we'll see you next time
welcome back to harbor unboxed today
we've got Tim on hand everyone and we
thought what better than to do a Q&amp;amp;A
session actually yeah we really thought
is there anything better we can do
anyway let's get to the questions
alright so the first question we have he
is from Jared stick and if you guys
haven't noticed Jared Tex
Jared Tech sorry in the comments below
click on his username head over to his
channel and check out his stuff cuz he
makes some really cool content anyway
his question was after all the major
harbour releases this year what are you
expecting or hoping to see next year
it's pretty good question I think next
year for PC hardware probably Rison -
and that's early in the year so that's
gonna be a pretty big deal I'm hoping to
see an increase of at least 15% now and
so that's probably down to IPC
improvements and frequency stuff and
then we've got of course in videos
voltar is also expected fairly yeah
probably mid you'd probably probably
there yeah that'll be good that'll be
either like what GeForce 11 or GeForce
it's 20 whatever they go whatever they
go with and I think the only other thing
I could think of is affordable ddr4
memory that would be nice yeah I'm also
looking forward to the HDR displays
actually coming out for series this time
we've seen them at CES last or this year
I think
yeah first care but all sorts of delays
and they've kind of held them back a bit
but hopefully they'll be out in the
market and yeah hopefully some OLED
stuff some high refresh 4k stuff here
high refresh rate 4k displays know
you're running it well that's true well
maybe with volta alright so the next
question is from rookie gamer aka Ark so
for anyone looking for a new mana what
will be the best
solution under $200 and was the
advantage of a VA panel over TN both
panel with one millisecond greater great
response times yet and uses mainly for
gaming and watching movies so when it
comes to minors under $200 you're pretty
much limited to 1080p you can sometimes
find 1440p on a sale for around that
price but you can get 1080p 14 144 Hertz
are for around that price that's
probably my recommendation there I love
my high refresh gaming as for you know
VA vs. TN VA is basically a better
version of ten it's a similar sort of
technology not quite the same as as IPs
but it has you know your better viewing
angles better contrast ratio better
colors than ten but very similar in
terms of its response times it's still
very good for gaming and ghosting and
that sort of thing yeah so basically if
you're looking for a panel and there's a
VA or a tee an option you should pretty
much always choose the VA sounds good to
me and I suppose for affordable monitors
as well at that tourney PE the high
refresh rate sort of makes sense because
you're not gonna be affording really
high-end graphics cards yeah that's for
so I think for the type of games as well
there will take advantage of those
higher refresh rates you can sort of get
away with a 1060 as well like quite
champions for example comes to and for
me you've done really well in it yeah
yeah alright next question we have here
is from Howells Bentley harbour unboxed
in your personal opinion do you hope
that AMD will keep pushing or do you
think they will crash and burn once more
ouch
okay no I don't think they'll crash and
burn I'm quite confident in 2018 that
will probably be aimed as year 2018
there but a lot of exciting things to
come I think they've got a very solid
architecture with Zen and yeah like we
said we got Zen too coming I'm hoping to
say I don't really know what to say
percentage-wise in terms of gains but
really hoping for about 15% at least 15%
yeah and this still room for a Mew to
grow into the other product categories
we've only just started to see their you
know rise and mobile stuff coming out so
hopefully in 2018 they'll be able to
grow into that field which is you know
massive so yeah it can't see them
crashing and burning
no I don't think they will I think
there's yeah 2018 I'm calling now will
be am Dez you don't want to go on a PC
games or anything I'm really cool the
whole we are okay next question is from
Adam W can you do a giveaway over on
patreon
for those of you that send you some love
every month yes I first of all thank you
to you guys that do give us a bit of
love each month and this is definitely
something I've been thinking of doing
first I was a bit hesitant to create a
patron only giveaway I thought that
might upset a few people but the more I
think about it the more I think it makes
sense and yeah the guys that support us
directly each month by giving that bit
of extra money it really does help us
out I think giving back to them or some
sort of giveaway and it probably won't
be anything major like a full system
giveaway but something would be really
nice to do and now that we do have Tim
coming on board full-time and that's
something that Tim's really keen revamp
is the patreon stuff next up we have a
question from mark sepra concer if i
butchered that second time there mate
okay the question is hey Steve are you
going to work on your patreon page in
near future like set some specific goals
or create more stuff for the patrons
well I think that's probably one since
Tim like I said is coming on board knee
Tim's really keen to revamp the patron
we were just talking about that earlier
so let you answer that with some of the
things you're thinking of doing yes you
might have seen that the patreon is kind
of a little bit neglected over the past
couple years obviously you still
appreciate people who are basically
giving us donations at the moment but
yeah we're looking to make some changes
some add some some new tiers to bring
some you know cool additional benefits
for people who do support us on patreon
and where we can get that stuff up and
live on you know in the next couple
weeks maybe some you know ability need
to chat to us through a place like disk
or something like that I think would be
really cool and a couple of other things
that you'll see probably pretty soon on
patreon yeah I like that and like I said
it's not just Tim also helping with the
patron just help me with crane the
content gives me some time to jump on
there and create some content for the
patrons so yeah that's gonna be good I
think yeah okay the next question is
from I I I suppose it could be LL or I I
anyway the question is why do games lag
even though fpso frames per second is
high and it isn't ping lag so basically
I think what you're referring to there
is what's commonly referred to as
stuttering so frame stutter and the
reasons for that can be fast it can be
software reasons so it could be a
outdated or bad display driver
stuttering became a really hot topic a
while ago with multi GPUs because yeah
that really relies heavily on the driver
to organize the two GPUs and if that's
not done properly you can get frames out
of sync or fake basically frame lag so
one of every frame no matter how many
freight so if you're doing 20 frames per
second one of those frames could take a
lot longer than another one that causes
a stuttering effect so it could be
driver software it could be a dirty
operating system problems there so
software or could just be hardware so
with the hardware you'll run into
stuttering when the CPU gets maxed out
so there's a delay there of the CPU
giving the GPU workload and that creates
a bit of a hitch there it could be
running out of VRAM system memory it's a
challenging thing to diagnose I would
say update you display drivers do a
driver uninstall clear out all the
drivers start from scratch with the
latest drivers basically look into how
you think the condition of your
operating system might be if it's been a
long time since you have cleaned it up
or you're noticing slowdowns in other
areas and probably do a fresh install
and also you can MSI Afterburner with
River tuner you can monitor your VRAM
usage you can monitor system memory
usage GP please know CPU usage so yeah
it's pretty hard to nail down but once
you sort of start diagnosing and
troubleshooting all those things you may
get to the root of the problem all right
so the next question comes from own car
M yes that we love named Butchie cookie
sorry about that he asks or she asks you
get most of your products from review
companies but what products do you
usually buy with your own money so I
guess for me I do get pretty
much everything from review you know
samples from companies buy no Steve I
think you buy some stuff yeah well I
suppose because you mostly do laptop and
phone review so expensive yeah
it's expensive and yeah most of it set
as for me yeah I do spend quite a few
thousand dollars each year on Hardware
sometimes it's even stuff I've already
got so for example I recently spent a
lot of money on the sky like X CPUs so
until sent me all of the review samples
and then there were claims that they
were well some people claiming they were
better than the retail chips at
overclocking and even just out of the
box performance and other people
claiming they weren't as good and there
was issues with them so I bought a
couple of CPUs and then I also only had
asrock motherboards and they will claim
that they weren't very with no throttle
too heavily so I bought some a sous
boards and a gigabyte board anyway it
turned out that it was all exactly the
same as the stuff tamati I've still got
it I'll hopefully pound that off to a
friend or somebody because I don't need
them yeah so a lot of different things
just to get reviews done sometimes I
can't get stuff or in the case of Intel
they didn't want to send retail chips
they said that they're what they call
the Q s chips they were the quality
sample chips they were as exactly the
same as the retail chips they didn't
want to send retail chips so just waited
sometimes yeah next question comes from
James and I'm not even going to bother
butchering your second name James so
we'll just skip straight to your
question Steve do you have a cat if if
so will it ever be featured on the
channel well first of all no I don't
have a cat so there's something to
figure out the feature on the channel my
daughters do have a cute little rabbit
but I'm not sure how keen it would be
being shoved into the barrel right
Timo's a cat yeah I do have a cat over
white sort of little cats named Java so
yeah you'll probably see my cat in the
background some b-roll shots and yeah
coming up she's very friendly cat so was
to get in there and annoy me while I'm
trying to do my work as all other time
awesome sorry yeah for all your cat
needs you'll have to go to Timmy's
routine
alright so the next question comes from
Louis agna from what budget size on
should you start carrying about a pcs
looks I think a lot of Tetris
too much on their budget on
better-looking components that have no
real impact on the PCs performance like
for example cases well Steve you
involved most the PC voiceover yeah I'll
try and tackle this one bit to this
question so yeah I totally agree with
this one this kind of annoys me a bit
not sure if you can blame this on the
techie youtubers or not yeah I don't
really know the origins of where it
started that all builds have to have
sleeved cables they like to be perfect
and everything has to be perfectly color
matched and you can only buy tech
according to its color scheme that's
kind of annoying I know my own personal
experience with doing the tech YouTube
stuff I wasn't really aware of how
annual people are about their themes and
sleeved cables and don't even get them
sad on how you apply thermal paste
that's that's that's a different thing
I'll getting off-topic yeah I don't even
really know how to tackle that one
because I did a budget build something
as four hundred dollar US budget builder
for $400 u.s. like this question sort of
getting it you don't really care about
how the computer looks you're really
after performance that's all that
matters at that price bang for your buck
and I used I think it was a bronze rated
power supply it was a really good pass
but it might have been a silver stone
from memory and it was a the cheap
sleeved cable so it's not the sort of
the plastic he messed up over them and
at the end it was a 24-pin cable you
could see the actual wire tables and I
felt that there the I believe mustard or
rainbow colored I couldn't believe the
comments I was getting from it was an
amazing value build I can't remember
it's on the channel somewhere but
incredible bang for your buck
performance that you could never
previously get for that price range and
I swear 50% of the comments were saying
it was a disgusting build because they
could see the rainbow colored tables I'm
thinking to myself guys so I can kind of
based on that I can kind of see why the
techy youtubers do focus so much on the
visual side of their budget builds as
silly as it sounds like LED lights and
light strips and that if you get that as
a bonus with your cooler that's fine but
going and buying them in a budget builds
just silly so yeah I would love
doing more builds that are realistic and
encourage people not to really worry
about having it look like it's a $2,000
hard to build almost comes first
exactly performs well then you can start
adding the things in yes sorry from what
budget should you start caring about
that kind of stuff I well it's
definitely a budget thing like $500 you
should not be carrying around that stuff
every last dollar should be getting you
should be maximizing what you're gonna
get in your gaming performance whether
it be you how your monitor is even you
keep on a mouse spend the money there
before you spend it on yeah
sleeves cables and flashy lights I'd
like to see more youtubers being able to
feel confident that they can use a
rainbow scape you probably not be
absolutely brutalized in the comment
section for doing so anyway and we have
another question here from mr. Wagner so
he says how should this channel develop
in let's say the next two years what do
you want to change or improve is there a
specific sub or viewcount that you want
to achieve okay good question
well okay projecting two years here I -
two years is pretty hard I'm struggling
to imagine where the channel will be in
one year looking back to the start of
this year I think we're about 45,000
subscribers and now we're at about
170,000 so it's not far off
it's at four three four times four times
four times don't laugh at me yeah so
four times the views have gone up a fair
bit things like engagement are really
good I don't really know what I'm
expecting or wanting over the next 12
months whether that is for it to double
again which would be mega or yeah got my
50% I don't know but the main thing with
Tim coming on board I really want to get
out even more regular content than we
been targeting almost a video a day or
pretty much will be going for every idea
think yeah getting close to that each
week hopefully without keeping the
quality the same or even improving the
quality because I've been doing almost a
video a day for this year so now I'll be
doing half as much as I was by still
achieving the same amount of content on
the channel so I'll be able to put more
time into my benchmark video so that's
going to be awesome so I suppose that's
what I'm hoping is to just improve the
content that I've been producing but
also still have a lot of content on the
channel
yeah and you have four times the subs
and the next question is from Justin
Note 3 how many people work at the
Harbor unboxed channel well yesterday
one today - yeah
Tim's been added to the team full time
now as a couple of you guys hopefully a
lot of you have seen Tim's content so he
has done stuff on the channel before but
that wasn't full time he was that you
know it was sort of just getting
climatized to the channel I'd say yeah
just a bit of part-time work and you
probably wouldn't have seen any of my
videos over the past couple months
because well they haven't actually been
any of them but uh yeah but I was
finishing off my engineering project for
my final year of my master's degree so I
finished that all now I hope that
actually be a qualified engineer but um
will be the second employee at Harbor
inbox um yeah it should be great to get
again and start making videos every
every week playtime's over with uni now
to work time to work hard you get on
that grind yep thank you next question
is from David Watson can you do a little
video about your PC what pcs you talking
about it's gorgeous ma'am well thank you
what case is that
it's okay yep big as a small fridge
looks great yeah okay this thing well
that's the first of all David there is a
build of I think it's a three part
series of the system on the channel I
did that quite a few months ago probably
earlier in the year I suppose it is my
computer but it's more of a set piece so
there's actually no operating system or
anything or no storage in it it's pretty
much just for show so there's a gtx 1070
founder's edition
and it did have a core i7 77 RK in there
which I stripped out that was difficult
to do with the hard part and there's no
know a seller on in there and I think
it's got it's it's it's got 32 gig of
ram in it but it's more of a ram holder
so again it's just there for show liven
the set up a bit I'll probably change it
next year to something else but I built
it it looked really cool I didn't have a
purpose for it it's way too big to give
away in a competition naturally I need
shares in a courier company to move that
anywhere it weighs it's over 50 kilos I
think yeah it's it's heavy very very
heavy so it's not going anywhere I'll
probably end up just stripping it all
down and repurposing some of the stuff
in it yeah anyway that's that computer
stuff you do want to see the build for
it
search for the Tower 900 a little point
in the right direction alright so the
next question is from Rick Anderson who
asks do you think being in Australia is
a disadvantage yeah definitely obviously
a lot of the big companies and stuff er
very focused on the United States is
their key market and you know a lot of
the companies have all their advertising
budgets all of their big PR teams over
there so it can often be really hard for
us to get the products if we want to
review and get in touch with the people
that we need to get in touch with over
here and obviously as well like a lot of
the events that we want to attend like
you know your Computex you see yes all
those things we have to fly you know a
long way to attend any of these shows
whereas yeah you know people in the US
they can just you know one out domestic
flight in there anywhere really but yeah
yeah Computex is kind of difficult for
everyone yes so that's one that's not
too bad for us but pretty much every
major product launch from Nvidia AMD
Intel is usually over in the States and
that's yeah massive haul for us and I
think you covered pretty much everything
there ITA getting review samples can be
hugely challenging I'm not saying it's a
picnic for the guys over in the US
there's plenty of competition over there
for stuff as well but like a lot I won't
name any of the brands in particular but
a lot of them for like big product
launches that you just
it's huge budget companies it's like
we've got one sample for your region
yeah yeah wonderful hole yeah it's not
just Australia sometimes it could be
like New Zealand in other places yeah
yeah so the whole whole region yeah so
that makes it really challenging and you
know it's nice that a lot of the time
harbour unboxing because we have the
textbook connection as well we do get
offered it first so that's fantastic and
we are grateful for that
sometimes the turnaround time is with
you know week and so I'll do the most
in-depth review I can in that time and
then all our viewers will be asking for
follow-up testing can you do this you
try that and it's like well I'm trying
to get one okay the next question is
from JD tech gear and JD Tucker is
actually another youtuber that does a
really cool content so go check him out
you'll probably see him comment below he
does watch a lot of our content so
appreciate ya in your opinion what's the
most underrated PC hardware company PS
really admire your drive and dedication
of the channel Steve thanks much okay
in my opinion companies that are
underrated PC how about companies that's
a tough one I would say I've top my head
as rock from other boards for sure they
still get bashed a bit as well I see in
the comments though a lot of people do
defend them these days because they
started out as like kind of like your EC
s like a really budget brand and their
boards really are still very cheap in
comparison to like a sue ski about MSI
but their BIOS is so good now really
good one of the best out there and
overclocking is great on them their
features are good just get really good
product and then the other one I would
probably say there's a lot of really
these days like good PC case makers like
I've only just started getting to the
fantex
stuff and their cases are gorgeous and
such high quality build quality on those
I think Silverstone is a company that
doesn't get a whole lot of recognition
and they make some really cool mini ITX
cases I've reviewed them over the years
and they're been good and they're just
really high-quality for what your payer
really affordable cases so I think
they're probably one of the underrated
case and they make good pass players as
well so and coolers but yeah so hope
that answers that question
all right so next question is from
Waseem H do you like pizza or pasta more
our video repeats in person love my
pizza I like pasta as well so both those
things are really good but I'll take a
pizza or a pasta okay yeah I think I'd
lean towards past but alright yeah I
actually
I mean pizza varies so much like pasty
yeah I mean yeah you know some places
you and the pizzas just I can't eat it
in other places like this is amazing so
I think there's much more variance in
the quality of pizza yeah and I last
year I built myself a pizza oven quite a
mega one in the backyard and not being a
big pizza femme my wife wanted it and
she makes the pizzas I cook them in that
and they are not to top myself up chef
but it's because she makes them they are
incredible I can't get enough homemade
pieces yeah it's nice thin base I don't
like a big belly I love the dough I'm
all that oh you're tall I'll make one
for you all right so a question from
Brandon projects between the 8700 K or
1,800 X both its stock speed which one
is better for editing 4k videos and
playback at full resolution and you're
adding some effects in Premiere Pro I'm
curious about these two CPUs are they
really good or do you have some
framedrops hmm yeah it's an interesting
one because both of them are fairly good
CPUs I would have thought for it for
video editing I mean I personally use
the risin 7 1700 X for my Premiere Pro
stuff and I think it's you know pretty
good for the 4k sort of playback and
that sort of thing but you gotta have as
well for things like you know adding
effects and yeah playback you've gotta
have you know I got a good GPU for the
super utilization and GPU offloading of
effects you've gotta have a lot of
memory and that sort of thing in a
really fast scratch disk so you can
scrub through this stuff really quick so
yes not just about CPU but I think you
have a better idea about some of these
stuff well yeah I think there's two
things there I mean this was basically
asking about editing okay he's with
Premiere Pro it's kind of a weird
program for
and all that sort of stuff to my
knowledge that's not that core heavy it
really prefers high IPC called mega
frequency so like an 87 or okay would be
probably dare I say it benefit editing
but then the other side of it is when
you've edited your 4k video if it's
quite long 20 minutes or so that can
take a long time to encode on an 87 okay
it'll take a long time on a 8 Corizon 7
processor as well but the 1,800 X would
be the faster CPU therefore incurring
because that really comes down to your
cores and threads so yeah kind of if you
could blend those two CPUs you would
have an awesome cuz I use a 69 50 X at
the moment yeah and I want to been
wanting to build it for weeks I'm trying
to get all the parts I'm very close to
building my thread Ripper 1950 X yeah
and when I benchmarked them with my 4k
60fps content these thread refer is much
faster at the encode or render process
compared to my 69 50 X which is a
Broadway Lee ten core 20 thread CPU so
and I think the 87 era K would be better
than both of those CPUs for the actual
editing part yeah it could be yeah so
that would be something I'll have to
look into that I know Brian from takeo
City is using the core i7 87 or okay
overclocked a5 2 gigahertz Fiza editing
and he reckons it's like nothing else so
yeah I guess it's yeah yeah do you want
yeah it's kind of this I don't think
there's one CPU that really does the
editing and the encoding yeah like
really well so yeah okay so we're
halfway through the Q&amp;amp;A video if you can
believe that only half will hey I've
decided to save the other 25 or 30
minutes whatever it is worth of
questions for tomorrow
I did take to Twitter a few days ago and
asked fans if they want the full one
hour video or two separate videos
because to myself we just couldn't work
out what would be the best format for
you guys anyway you like weren't too
helpful though so thanks for that a
50-50 split 1288 votes what are the
chances that we'd end up with a 50/50
split
anyway Arctic did make a good point he
said since the poll was split
split the video into two sections it's
fairly sound logic so tomorrow you'll be
able to see the rest of the video and
finally find out if Tim nailed the outro
I'm your host Steve Tim's still here in
