another huge benchmark session this time
the focus is on invidious new chief
force gtx 1062 weeks ago I was able to
reveal the 1060 and most of its specs in
the video here rather than go over
everything again here's a table I put
together comparing the 1060 specs to the
1070 and some of the last generations
Maxwell GPUs as you can see the 1060 is
a tiny 200 millimeter squared eye and
yet thanks to the 16 nanometer FinFET
process and video was able to cram
inside an incredible 4.4 billion
transistors this means despite being 12%
smaller than the GTX 960 the 1060 Bose
50% more transistors which is allowed in
video to increase the coil count by 25%
the 1060 also features 80 texture units
and 48 hour rupees in total the 1060
shoots with 1280 CUDA cores and 10 SM
units the memory subsystem consists of
six 32-bit memory controllers for a
total bust width of 192 bit using 6
gigabytes of gddr5 memory operating in
at 8 gigabits per second data rate the
base clock speed of the 1060 is one
thousand five hundred and six megahertz
and the typical boost clock speed is
1700 eight megahertz nvidia says that
the boost clock speed is based on the
average 1060 card running a wide variety
of games and applications of course as
we've seen with the 1070 and 1080 the
actual bruise clock will vary depending
on conditions namely thermals and power
target the GTX 1060 reference board or
founders Edition if you will measures
two hundred and forty nine millimeters
in length display outputs include one
jewel link DVI one HDMI and three
DisplayPort connectors like the R X 480
we find just a single 6pn PCIe power
connector but with the TDP set of just
120 watts
we don't expect in video we'll run into
the same issues AMD faced so with the
basic information now out of the way
let's get to the stuff you guys really
came for the benchmarks as always you
guys can find all the graphs at the
hardware and box website which would be
linked in the description below after
looking at the results from a select few
games and going to be heavily analyzing
the data from all 25 games across the
multiple resolutions to get a clear idea
of how the 1066 up before I do
into the benchmarks here are a few quick
notes all tests were conducted using my
GPU test rig which is built inside the
corsair carbide 600c with an Intel Core
i7 6700 K clocked and locked a 4.5
gigahertz for a full list of the system
specs please check the video description
you'll also find a detailed video index
there as well
finally all benchmarks were conducted
after a 10-minute warmup period as this
is sufficient time to get these cards up
to their maximum working temperature as
always I'm using reference AMD and video
graphics cards unless specified I'll be
focusing on the 1440p resolution for the
discussion but I'll quickly take a look
at the 1080p performance as well let's
start with doom shall we since it's a
game I recently read benchmark due to
its Vulcan implementation for you guys
we've tested all 12 graphics cards using
both the OpenGL and Vulkan API so you
can see how the AMD and NVIDIA card
stack up I'll just skim over the 1080p
results as I've decided to focus on
1440p with the GTX 1060 given us
performance here we see the 10 60s 13%
faster than the rx 480 using OpenGL but
shockingly 14% slower with Vulcan let's
see if this changes a 1440p this time
the 1060 was 15% faster than the RX for
80 using OpenGL but it was also 14%
faster and Vulcan
in fact the 1060 performance in Doom was
very subpar as lost out to not just the
GTX 980 but also the 970 hopefully this
isn't a sign of what's to come
I suspect what we're looking at here is
a driver issue let's move on to find out
if the 1060 does any better in overwatch
okay so things couldn't look more
different in overwatch here the GTX 1060
was 21% faster than the RX 480
20% faster than the 970 and impressively
eight percent faster than the 980 the
1060 was 24% slower than the 1070 though
that was to be expected after all it was
still 27% slower when testing with doom
increasing the resolution to 2560 by
1440 helps the 1060 extend its lead over
the RX 480
as it's now 27% faster the 1060 also
increased its margin over the 980 to 11%
that said it was still 23% slower than
the 1070 here we have the division and
at 1080p we find a very close battle
between the gtx 1060 and our X 480 the
video does burn out here but only by a
very slim 3% margin now at 1440p 1060 is
able to pull further ahead of the
ready extending the margin to 12% this
saw the 1060 beat the 980 by a 4% margin
while it matched the 390x Hitman was
tested using both DirectX 11 and DirectX
12 even under DirectX 11 nvidia gpus
performed pretty poorly in hitman here
we see the 10 60s 4% slower than the 488
and moving to DirectX 12 only amplified
some videos issues in this game where
the 1060 is now 14% slower even at 1440p
the our X 480 along with the i9 390 have
no issue beating the new 1060 in hitman
although the 1060 was faster than the
980 it was still 4% slower than the 480
when using DirectX 11 I'm yet to update
my results for tomb raider using DirectX
12 so for now we'll have to settle for
the DirectX 11 numbers from what I've
seen the GTX 1060 does stay well ahead
of the RX 480 even when using DirectX 12
here we see the 1060 being the 480 by a
16% margin with an average frame rate of
96 fps the 1060 is able to crack the 60
FPS barrier of 1440 Peters again 16%
faster than the RX 480
it was however 3 percent slower than the
GTX 980 which was surprising
total war Warhammer is another game that
I'm yet to start testing with DirectX 12
DirectX 12 is marked as beta at the
moment which is why I've been reluctant
to make the move using DirectX 11 we see
that in video does have an advantage
here the 1060 is 12% faster than the
arcs 480 surprisingly the 1060 was 10%
slower than the GTX 980 despite matching
the iodine nano increasing the
resolution to 1440p we see that the 1060
is still faster than the RX 480
this time 10% faster still the 1060 was
15% slower than the GTX 980 which is
interesting it makes me wonder if we'll
be seeing better performance out of the
1060 in this title through a driver
update Mirror's Edge catalyst is another
new game we've started testing with
though this title only supports DirectX
11 as you can see the 1060 is faster
than the RX 480
12% faster in fact at 1080p now at 1440p
we see a few interesting things most
interesting of which is the fact that
the 1060 is now quite a bit faster than
the GTX 980 whereas they delivered the
same performance at 1080p the 1060 is
now 20% faster and this makes me think
the 4 gigabyte memory buffer of the 980
is to blame here Mirror's Edge catalyst
was one of the few games that showed the
8 gigabyte R X 480 outperforming the
cheaper 4 gigabyte model speed
king of the Ark's 480 here we see that
the 1060 is just 7% faster with an
average of 49 fps supposed to 46 fps
ARMA 3 oh I'm a 3 why do I test with you
ah that's right because you guys beg for
it every time so here we are
unfortunately ARMA 3 doesn't play nice
at the RX 480 and as a result the gtx
1060 is 31% faster in this title here
the 480 would dip as low as 48 fps
while the 1060 never dropped below 68
fps again at 1440p the 1060 was 31%
faster than the RX 480
though this time was 4% slower than the
Ono 390x
and gtx 980 it seems strangely rx4i you
so much slower than the ina 390 and our
3 given a tibula matches or beats the r9
390 I know someone's going to say it in
the comments so let me address this real
quick testing with hair works enable
doesn't put the AMD cards at a
disadvantage in the witcher 3 anymore
we've moved on from 2015 the 1060 is
just 7% faster than the RX 480 with hair
works enabled and you can expect to see
a similar margin within 1 to 2% with
hair wefts disabled ok so let's move on
to 1440p here the 1060 is just 5% faster
than the RX 480 as it isn't able to beat
the GTX 980 this time trailing by a 6%
margin still The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt is
demanding game with all the icon who
turned on so an average of 44 fps of
1440p is a commendable result this is
where I expected the 1062 really impress
me and well it has total system power
draw with the 1060 was 17 percent lower
than with the R X 480 just 195 watts
moreover using the 1060 our test system
consumed just 15% more power than the
GTX 960 which is remarkable given we saw
GTX 980 like performance for the most
part still the 1060 doesn't exactly
destroy the our X 480 here though it has
to be said saving 30 to 40 watts is
going to making videos mid-range
offering much easier to cool
speaking of cool things let's check out
the fans Edition operating temperature
as we expected the GTX 1060 does run
very cool the fans Edition never saw the
GPU temp you sees 64 degrees which is a
similar result to the GTX 960 this is a
huge improvement over both the GTX 980
and the radiant rx 480 for those
wondering the 10 60,000 Edition runs
really quiet it definitely couldn't be
heard of my Corsair combos
TK's fans which are very quiet to begin
with okay so in this video I took an
individual look at just nine of the 25
games tested for the other 16 games be
sure to check out the written version of
this review of the hardware and box
website for this video I didn't want to
take out 30 minutes or so of your time
walking you through all 25 games just
the thought of it is exhausting instead
I'm going to make a few quick GPU
comparisons based on the data from all
25 games tested but Before we jump to
that here's a quick look at the
performance vs. power consumption data
using a scatterplot graph for those
unaware the further ADATA plot is to the
right on the x axis the faster the
framerate
while the higher the figure on the
y-axis the greater the power consumption
so in short if your GPU you ideally want
to be as low and as far right on this
graph as possible doing just that is the
gtx 1070 which consume just 2.91 watts
per frame the GTX 1060 came in second
consumers slightly more power per frame
thanks to a much lower average frame
rate
let's declutter things a little by
removing all GPUs except for the 1070
1060 and our X 480 here we see that when
compared to the rx 480 the 1060 did very
well and from a 25 game sample proved it
was 25% more efficient however let's
remove all the DirectX 11 titles and
focus on the games that feature
low-level API support these games
include hitman ashes of the singularity
in Doom as you can see the picture
changes quite dramatically as invidious
GPUs become slightly less efficient and
aim D's are X 480 becomes considerably
more efficient thanks to a bump in
performance here we see when using
DirectX 12 and Vulcan the GTX 1060 and
rx 480 of pretty much on par with one
another so that's interesting to see now
how did the gtx 1060 and our expertise
stack up at 1080p on average the 1060
was 12% faster across the 25 games
tested the only real outliers here
include hitman anno 2205 ARMA 3 and
surprisingly battlefield 4 games where
the margins were very close include
black ops 3 batman ashes of the
singularity in the division moving to
1440p the big picture doesn't really
change much 1060 still 12% faster than
the 480 and we see the same outliers
compared to the i9 390 the gtx 1060 was
an average 10% faster of 1440p and we
see the same outliers from the our X 480
comparison so how does the 1060 compare
to the nine-eight
you after all in video promised the
power of a GTX 980 for every gamer
well they look to have delivered on that
promise as overall the 1060 was 1%
faster that said for more than half the
games tested the 1060 was slower though
in most of those games the margin was 5%
or less what about the next step in the
Pascal food chain the gtx 1070 well the
1060 was an average 26 percent slower
which isn't bad given the founders
edition there's at least 26 percent
cheaper
well partner cars should be around 40%
cheaper those rocking at GTX 960 will
certainly notice the upgrade to the 1060
as we found it was an average 81 percent
faster in fact worst case scenario still
saw the 1060 deliver over 50% more
performance the final and probably the
most important data comparison I'm gonna
make is the cost per frame the figure
next to the GPU model is based on the
current typical asking price and US
dollars from popular retailers such as
newegg.com and Amazon most of these GPUs
are a bit redundant now such as the fury
ax GTX 980 and 970 for example but I've
included them anyway out of interest
the 1060 found Edition comes into the
cost of five dollars per frame based on
average performance from the 25 games
tested this is kind of poor value
frankly the gtx 1070 for example cost
only slightly more of $5 30
well the arcs for 8 is considerably
cheaper of $4 44 and that's for the 8
gigabyte bottle for me though the RX 484
gigabyte model is where the value is at
even if it really is a 4 gigabyte card
and not a model that can be unlocked at
$200 the 4 gigabyte model cost us $3 70
per frame as it delivers the same
performance as the a gigabyte model in
our tests this means in video really
needs those board partner cards to come
in at the $250 MSRP if they want to be
competitive in the sub $300 price range
at that price the 1060 came in a cost to
$4 16 per frame making a 6 percent
cheaper than the 8 gigabyte our X 480
but 12 percent more than the 4 gigabyte
model quite a few of you didn't like the
scatterplot graph in my RX 480 review
when it came to showing the cost per
frame many of you asked for bar graphs
instead here we have the GPU sorted by
the average frame rate performance and
I've highlighted the $250 board partner
10 60 as well as a 4 gigabyte our X 480
here you can see the same graph Reiss
ordered according to cost per frame
starting the cheapest card ranging down
to the most expensive as you can see the
RX 480
for gigabyte card does just edged out
the board partner 10 60s assume they do
actually come in at 250 us well there
you have it all of it the GTX 1060 is as
expected faster than the rx for 80 while
also going a little easier on your power
supply our 25 game sample indicates
you'll see a little over 10% more
performance on average but you'll also
pay a little over 10% more per frame
when compared to the 4 gigabyte our X
480 if we do indeed see in videos
partners delivering custom cards to
market for 250 us I feel AMD's our X 480
a qi card could be in trouble
this is down to the fact that it cost
more per frame as a result of being
slower
of course it consumes more power as well
and probably won't offer the same degree
of overclocking Headroom speaking of
which you can check out my GTX 1060
founders edition overclocking video here
well my first gtx 1060 board partner
review which includes overclocking can
be found here overall I feel it's too
soon to call a real winner here that
said it is fair to say we now have a
real fight on our hands once again in
the sub $300 GPU market and that will
likely end up being good news for you
guys a lot of things are going to shape
this battle over the next six months
from board partner cards - I'm coming
DirectX 12 titles so I can't wait to see
how it all plays out unfortunately I
don't yet have any Australian pricing
