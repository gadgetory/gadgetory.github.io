throw away that armor it's time to get
primal you have to hand it to yourself
for trying something different and
that's exactly what Far Cry primal is
the game is said in 10000 BC during the
beginning of the Mesolithic period it
takes place in the fictional horas
Valley in Central Europe an open world
filled with iconic wildlife such as
mammoths and saber-toothed Tigers the
Bible is a daily challenge as tribes
come into conflict with one another and
nature the majestic land of our us is
tall and due to the confrontation of the
three dominant tribes who seek the same
single objective to conquer it's two
cars people the when your tribe is at
risk they're being attacked both by the
cannibals of uddham tribe led by the
cruel warrior all and the fire
worshippers of the Zillah tribe led by
the high priest despot re immersed in
the untamed world of our US land full of
dangers to Cal have to unite and protect
the when your people from the dangerous
enemies you demand new Zillah peoples
built using the aging Junior engines to
game engine also used by far cry 4 and
far cry 3 the game still promises
amazing visuals initially thought to be
a spinoff sized titles similar to Far
Cry 3 Blood Dragon the primal campaigns
instead ended up being as long as far
cry 4 primal offers a fully fledged
single-player experience without
multiplayer mode as the developer wanted
to focus on the game's core gameplay
instead this is probably not a bad thing
there I'm more than happy to frag
friends with high powered machine guns
but tapping holes into their skulls
while they're still alive might have
taken the land parties to another level
dexter style so far the game seems to be
receiving mostly positive reviews and
from the little that I played it seems
like an intriguing single-player
experience something I'm already loving
about the game is the excellent built-in
benchmarks I know I probably don't get
excited about the same things as most
gamers still the inclusion of a built-in
benchmark isn't something we expect to
define so it was a pleasant surprise it
also appears to do a great job of
simulating the kind of performance games
we'll see throughout the game benchmark
runs for 50 seconds and spits out a
number of results once complete I've
recorded the minimum and average frame
rates for testing we focused on the 10
P 1440p porque resolutions is the ultra
quality preset there are also some
results at 1080p using a very high
preset as well finally the latest AMD
and NVIDIA drivers were used and this
includes the GeForce 360 - game ready
driver which was released last night
annoyingly
I just finished filming and editing this
video when Nvidia released a game ready
driver for Far Cry primal it's been
effectively having to start over again
for the GeForce based graphics cards
however it quickly became apparent that
this new driver did nothing to improve
single GPU performance in Primal and
instead just enables SLI support
primal is very demanding with the ultra
quality settings in use even at 1080p
and it seems the days of 60fps + @ 1080p
are becoming prehistoric pun intended
even the fury X dips down to 52 fps and
it took a gtx 980ti to sustain over 60 F
yes meanwhile owners of what were once
considered mid-range offerings in the
gtx 960 and r9 380 saw a sharp stick in
the eye the 380 didn't tear too poorly
but the 34 FPS drops were noticeable the
smooth gameplay without noticeable frame
drop-offs games require at least two gtx
970 or r9 390 at 1440p the gtx 960 may
as well be from the Stone Age I can't
imagine it providing playable
performance of this resolution using
anything higher than medium even the gtx
980ti couldn't average 60 FPS at 1440p
and could be seen dropping down to 47
FPS personally I found under these
conditions the GTX 980 or r9 390x were
required given what we've seen at the
previous resolution it comes as no
surprise that a single 980ti or fury X
can't really deliver players performance
at 4k still if you reduce the quality
settings a remove SMA it should be
possible to achieve smooth playable
performance lowering the quality preset
from old roads are very high at 1080p
allow for 12
performance boost when using the gtx 960
that wasn't enough for smooth gameplay
the r9 380 received a 14% performance
boost for the average framerate while
the minimum went unchanged higher-end
graphics cards such as the i9 390 you
were able to boost their minimum frame
rate by as much as 17% finally let's
take a look at how the gtx 960 in i9 380
perform at 1080p using the various
quality presets as you can see
regardless of quality settings the 960
is currently well behind the 380 in
primal that we're hoping video will be
able to further optimize their cards
processing of the game shortly with
another driver update as they often do
looking at the 380 we see a mild 14%
performance boost when going from ultra
to very high then a much larger 29%
performance boost to seen when going
from very high to just higher to hide a
normal preset netted us just 3% more
performance and finally from normal to
load booster performance by 28% I've no
doubt did a great many of you are going
to be disappointed with the performance
we're seeing from the current generation
GPUs in this title to be fair the
graphics are highly detailed and
remember this is a large open
environment game also if you back the
quality settings down too high which
still looks very good it found an
average frame rates of boosted by almost
50% still those wanting to enjoy the
prehistoric landscape in all of its
high-definition 1080p glory will need to
shell out for a Radeon r9 390 or faster
1440p gamers will need to pull out the
big guns and we really recommend the gtx
980 or faster here as always for Kate
gamers who require multiple high-end
GPUs though turning the quality settings
down to high should be enough to receive
playable performance with the gtx 980ti
or fury X I expect a few performance
enhancements to come out over the next
few weeks particularly in the form of an
updated driver from Nvidia unfortunately
while the GeForce game ready driver did
deliver an SLI profiler did nothing to
improve the weak single GPU performance
their mid-range to lower end cards on
that note we found that performance of
the GeForce graphics cards very strange
the 980ti can be consistently found at
the top of our charts crashing
everything or the 980 struggles nothing
fails against the 390x
the 970 also struggled against the 390
but it was the 960 that shocked the most
what can I
we described as horrible performance
surely the gtx 960 shouldn't be that
much slower than the r9 380 in Far Cry
primal also keep in mind that the game
launched the day one patch which did
address a few stability and performance
issues so it's possible there could be
more to come
performance aside the Far Cry primal
looks like a lot of fun now hurt the
enjoyment lasts throughout the entire
campaign the Beastmaster elements of the
game looked like a lot of fun and I bet
Miley Cyrus's manager which is he or she
had the ability to tame animals just
like the car does be sure let me know
what you think about the Far Cry primal
single-player experience as well as the
performance on your system in the
comments and on our forum our Hardware
on box comms good luck in the land of R
Us and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
