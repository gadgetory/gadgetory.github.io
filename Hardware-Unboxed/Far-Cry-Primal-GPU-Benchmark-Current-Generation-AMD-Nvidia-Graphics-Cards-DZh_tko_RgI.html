throw away that armor it's time to get
primal you have to hand it to oversell
for trying something different and
that's exactly what Far Cry primal is
the game is said in 10,000 BC during the
beginning of the mesolithic period it
takes place in the fictional oras valley
in central europe an open world filled
with iconic wildlife such as mammoth and
saber tooth tigers the Bible is daily
challenge as tribes come into conflict
with one another and nature the majestic
land of our us is tall and due to the
confrontation of the three dominant
tribes who seek the same single
objective to conquer it's two cars
people the Wagner tribe is a risk
they're being attacked both by the
cannibals of yuddam tribe led by the
cruel warrior all and the fire
worshippers of the Zilla tribe led by
the High Priestess behtari immersed in
the untamed world of our us land full of
dangers to Cal have to unite and protect
the when your people from the dangerous
enemies do demand the azilla people's
built using the aging junior engine to
game engine also used by far cry 4 and
far cry 3 the game still promises
amazing visuals initially thought to be
a spin-off sighs title similar to far
cry 3 blood dragon the primal campaigns
instead ended up being as long as far
cry 4 primal offers a fully fledged
single-player experience without
multiplayer mode as the developer wanted
to focus on the game's core gameplay
instead this is probably not a bad thing
no I'm more than happy to frag friends
with high-powered machine guns but
tapping holes into their skulls while
they're still alive might have taken the
LAN parties to another level Dexter
style so far the game seems to be
receiving mostly positive reviews from
the little that I played it seems like
an intriguing single-player experience
something i'm already loving about the
game is the excellent built-in
benchmarks I know I probably don't get
excited about the same things as most
gamers still the inclusion of a built-in
bench mark isn't something we expect to
define so it was a pleasant surprise it
also appears to do a great job of
simulating the kind of performance games
will see throughout the game benchmark
runs for 50 seconds and spits out a
number of results once complete I've
recorded the minimum and average frame
rates for testing with folks
from the 1080p 1440p and 4k resolutions
is the ultra quality preset there are
also some results at 1080p use in a very
high preset as well finally the latest
AMD and nvidia drivers were use and this
includes the geforce 362 game ready
driver which is released last night
annoyingly I just finished filming and
editing this video when in video release
the game ready driver for far cry primal
it's been effectively having to start
over again the G Force Base graphics
cards however it quickly became apparent
that this new driver did nothing to
improve single GPU performance in primal
and instead just enables us a lot of
support primal is very demanding with
the ultra quality settings in use even
at 1080p and it seems the days of 60 FPS
plus at 1080p are becoming prehistoric
pun intended even the fury ex dibs down
to 52 FPS and it took a gtx 980 TI to
sustain over six year yes meanwhile
owners of what will once considered
mid-range offerings in the gtx 960 and
r9 380 khabar sharp stick in the eye the
380 didn't care too poorly but the 34
FPS drops were noticeable for smooth
gameplay without notes will frame
drop-offs games require at least two gtx
970 or r9 390 @ 1440p the gtx 960 may as
well be from the Stone Age I can't
imagine it providing playable
performance of this resolution using
anything higher than medium even the gtx
980 TI couldn't average 60 FPS at 1440p
and can be seen dropping down to 47 fps
personally I found under these
conditions the gtx 980 or r9 390 x were
required given what was seen at the
previous resolution it comes as no
surprise that a single 980 TI or fury x
can't really deliver playable
performance at 4k still if you reduce
the quality settings to remove SMAA
should be possible to achieve smooth
playable performance lowering the
quality preset from ultra router very
high 1080p allow for twelve percent
performance boost when using the gtx 960
that wasn't enough for smooth gameplay
the Arno 380 received a 14-percent
performance boost for the average frame
rate while the minimum went unchanged
higher end graphics cards such as the
i-9 390 you were able to boost their
minimum frame rate by as much as
seventeen percent finally let's take a
look at how the gtx 960 and 90 380
perform at 1080p using the various
quality presets as you can see
regardless of quality settings the 960
is currently well behind the 380 in
Primal that we're hoping video will be
able to further optimize their cards
processing of the game shortly with
another driver update as they often do
looking at the 380 we see a mild
fourteen percent performance boost when
going from ultra to very high then a
much larger twenty-nine percent
performance boost to seen when going
from very high to just hire the hide a
normal preset noted us just three
percent more performance and finally
from normal to load booster performance
by twenty eight percent I've no doubt
did a great many of you are going to be
disappointed with the performance we're
seeing from the current generation GPUs
in this title to be fair the graphics
are highly detailed and remember this is
a large open environment game also if
you back the quality settings down too
high which still looks very good it
found average frame rates are boosted by
almost fifty percent still those wanting
to enjoy the prehistoric landscape in
all of its high-definition 1080p glory
will need to shell out for radeon r9 390
or faster 1440p gamers will need to pull
out the big guns and we really recommend
the gtx 980 or faster here as always for
Kate gamers will require multiple high
and GPUs though turning the quality
settings down to high should be enough
to receive playable performance with the
GTX 980 TI or fury x i expect a few
performance enhancements to come out
over the next few weeks particularly in
the form of an updated driver from
nvidia unfortunately while the geforce
game-ready driver did deliver an SLI
profiler did nothing to improve the week
single GPU performance their mid range
to lower end cards on that note we found
that performance of the geforce graphics
cards very strange the 980 TI i can be
consistently found at the top of our
charge crushing everything while the 980
struggles nothing fails against the 390
x the 970 also struggled against
390 but it was the 960 that shocked the
most what can only be described as
horrible performance surely the gtx 960
shouldn't be so much slower than the r9
380 in Far Cry primal also keep in mind
that the game launched the day one patch
which did address a few stability and
performance issues so it's possible
there could be more to come performance
aside Far Cry primal looks like a lot of
fun no hurt the enjoyment last
throughout the entire campaign the
beastmaster elements of the game looked
like a lot of fun and I bet Miley
Cyrus's manager which is he or she had
the ability to tame animals just like
the car does be sure let me know what
you think about the Far Cry primal
single-player experience as well as the
performance on your system in the
comments and on-air for my hardware on
box comms good luck in the land of our
us and i'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
