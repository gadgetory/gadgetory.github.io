that all of you guys are super eager to
see what amy has in store for you with
third gen rising and the good news is
our review isn't too far away in fact in
just a few days time we will have a full
performance breakdown for you but before
that I just wanted to take the time and
recap the Rison journey so far
and just have a look at how the
ecosystem has evolved over the course of
two years
so let's go back to first gen risin
which launched in March of 2017 and
shook up the desktop CPU landscape for
the first time in a long time
on March 2nd AMD Unleashed their new
Rison 7 lineup which consisted of the
horizon 7 1800 X at $500
horizon 7 1700 X at $400 and the risin 7
1700 at 330 dollars all offering 8 cores
and 16 threads on the am 4 platform with
intel's flagship consumer desktop art at
the time being a measly quad core Core
i7 7700 K the fact md was providing
double the cause was of course a pretty
big deal but before we got a look at
performance there were concerns and
doubts about AMD's ability to deliver as
reviews we had just struggled through
the terrible AMD FX 0 where AMD often
delivered high core count parts only to
get smoked in basically every
performance test AMD were promising a
huge 52 percent improvement to IPC with
zem compared to excavator but we were
wondering how this will translate into
real-world performance for productivity
these chips were champions across the
workloads we tested the chips were very
impressive and beat the 7700 K in key
words like Adobe Premiere and often rise
and went toe-to-toe with Intel's higher
core count h EDT chips while all
processors were great value for
productivity the 330 dollar risin 7 1700
was basically a steal for these
workloads given it could be overclocked
up to the level of the 1800 X in many
cases however gaming performance was a
bit of an issue at launch AMD in their
rising presentation insisted on testing
with a high end GPU at a 4k resolution
which as we said in our review
he isn't how you test a CPU for gaming
this meant aim he was essentially
masking their performance issues in
gaming and when it came to actually
testing the chips we were left a bit
disappointed even though we did expect
Rison to struggle here a bit in our
initial coverage the i7 7700 k ended up
around 21% faster 1080p gaming than the
Rison 7 1800 X and initially there was a
lot of discussion around these results I
distinctly remember reviewers like
gamers Nexus copying a lot of hate over
these performance numbers given their
words happen on risings performance I
guess given it was still quite far
behind Intel's performance in gaming we
thought that perhaps there was some sort
of configuration issue initially maybe
some day one driver issues or
motherboard teething problems stopping
these chips from performing better in
hindsight it's kind of funny looking
back over all the confusion that Rosen's
initial launch as it turns out the
margin between Raisa and KB Lake stayed
relatively consistent across the months
after its launch it maybe improved a
little bit from optimizations and so on
but the general consensus remains that
the 7700 came was a superior gaming
processor interestingly now two years
later is kind of a different story and
Steve has a great video breaking down
how the 1,800 X stacks up against the
7700 K in modern titles the key thing to
note here is that while the 1800 X
didn't really improve much in older
games newer titles began to utilize rise
and more effectively and started
utilizing more than four cores and eight
threads betweens in a lot of demanding
games the 1800 X is actually now faster
than the 7700 K so there's certainly
been an interesting if gradual change to
how these CPUs have fared for gaming
tasks part of the reason games are using
more than four cores can be attributed
to Intel's response to Rison later in
2017 the company launched the core i7
8700 K and other coffee-like
chips which increased the top core count
to six cores and delivered better
performance again in productivity tasks
first generation 7 still competes
strongly with the 8700 K given it has 8
cores compared to 6 but the gap adil
close up and for any workloads that were
single threaded or heavily used
AVX the 8700 K did be rising and then
for gaming daily 700 K handily
the 7700 K and managed to extend its
lead over ricin which led us to call it
the new gaming king meanwhile or
actually a little before Intel's new
coffee like chips AMD did launch what
would become the best of the rise in
lineup risin five and in particular the
$220 rise in five 1600 for this low
price AMD was offering a CPU that often
beat or came very close to beating the
core i7 7700 K in for activity workloads
and while it suffered from the same
gaming drawbacks as the rise in seven
CPUs it wasn't that much slower in games
at the time and definitely held its own
against Intel similarly priced Core i5 s
again Intel return served with the core
i5 8400 unlocked 6 core 6 thread part
which defeated the risin 5 1600 in
gaming for a lower price while falling a
bit behind in productivity while this
part was a good deal at the time it was
almost impossible to buy one at the MSRP
four months which heard its value
proposition this allowed me to jump on
board with some price cuts and keep the
1600 firmly in front of mainstream
gamers buying decisions
personally I jumped on board as arise in
7 1700 early adopter within the first
month of its release and it was a fairly
rocky start there were issues like
unstable software particularly BIOS
updates for motherboards as vendors work
through some of the problems with the
initial launch memory support was always
a bit dodgy and could vary a bit
depending on the CPU and motherboard you
got certainly Intel CPUs were compatible
with much higher memory speeds in fact
motherboard quality in general for the
first three iterations wasn't amazing as
I think many OEMs decided not to focus a
lot of resources on AMD platforms given
Intel was still what people were buying
it's pretty crazy to see how far we've
come going from X 372 X 570 all the big
vendors this time around have top-notch
boards with beefy vrm designs because
enthusiasts are now buying plenty of AMD
chips and plenty of AMD boards to go
with it anyway aside from my early
issues with rice and the performance I
was achieving for the price was
phenomenal and the 1700 was the perfect
combination of productivity performance
and gaming performance for my needs it
was just as fast at video encoding as
expensive Intel h EDT offerings and for
me as a 34 40 by 1440 gamer not 1080p
with CPU limits are a big issue right
while gaming performance compared to
Intel was a bit of a non-issue in April
of 2018 AMD launched second gen Rison
based on Zen plus and built on 12
nanometer technology rather than
staggering the launch AMD pushed out
Rison 7 and Rison 5 CPUs in a simplified
lineup on the same date with lower
prices horizon 720 700 X at 330 dollars
horizon 7 2700 at $300 horizon 520 600 X
230 dollars and the Rison 5 2600 at $200
as for performance 2nd gen Rison largely
delivered three things a small but
serviceable increase to CPU clock speeds
improved latency for small improvements
to gaming performance and support for
higher frequency memory the story didn't
change a whole lot thanks to these
improvements the areas where Rison was
strong like productivity performance got
a bit stronger and Rison was able to
offer better value than Intel in this
segment while with gaming a 7 percent
improvement looking in the 2700 X versus
the 1800 X meant that it still fell
behind the 7700 K and 8700 K on average
of course later in 2018 Intel did
respond again with the kora 999 hundred
K bringing 8 cores and 16 threads to
their mainstream desktop platform for
the first time with Intel now having
core parity with AMD Intel's ability to
 their CPUs at up to 5 gigahertz
compared to the low 4 gigahertz range
Verizon meant that the 9900 K was faster
than the 2700 X across the board but
like with first generation second
generation continued to deliver in one
key area and that was value while the
9900 K was priced at over $500 at launch
and continues to be around $500 to this
day AMD was able to offer decent
performance for several hundred dollars
less particularly in the back half of
2018 the rise in seven 2700 was often
available for just 250 dollars making it
a really competitive option in terms of
value better than that were once again
the rise in five CPUs in fact for much
of 2018 with Intel CPUs facing shortages
especially with the popular Core i5 8400
second gen rise in five CPUs were by far
the best option for mid-range and entry
level gaming PC builds while the Rison 5
2600 launched at $200 it was available
for 170 dollars as early as July 2018
and
sales dropped that to an insane a
hundred and fifty dollars on a regular
basis and of course while all of this
was happening we had thread rip and ap
used occupying the top and bottom ends
of the market often delivering highly
competitive performance at great prices
as well but I guess if I talked about
all this Brooks as well including the
2950 ex which I personally use for video
editing would be here for quite a lot
longer so in reflection over the last
few years I think Rison has been largely
quite impressive Andy has gone from
being thoroughly uncompetitive in CPUs
to offering products that are actually
worth buying for a good year and a half
until Intel responded with the acquire
nine ninety nine hundred came and beheld
their performance productivity crown for
mainstream desktop processes in most
workloads and delivered excellent value
across the board especially with Rison 5
we've also come a long way with some of
the issues Rison had almost all the
early adopter issues and non existent
today memory support is fine and second
generation can support high frequency
memory there are no stability issues and
I think we've all come to accept the
position that AME holds in gaming has
fine for many use cases while Reisen
does still lose at 1080p gaming with the
high end GPU for those playing at 1440p
or with me range GPUs even rise in five
CPUs deliver a great experience at a
fantastic price in modern titles
motherboard quality is also improved and
it looks like we're getting the best
generation yet with the upcoming x5 70
on top of that many people have figured
out ways to tweak memory performance
with older Rison products discretes at
the last few drops and finally the
promise of a m4 upgradability seems to
be a definite reality with older boards
continuing to support their generalising
processes today but for all the good
things Rison has brought there are still
some areas AMD has to improve in the
Quran I 9900 K is the fastest mainstream
desktop chip on the market for both
productivity workloads and gaming amy
has loved to offer strong productivity
performance and I think this is one area
they'll be looking to reclaim the crown
with third gen Rison and higher core
parts down the line
amy has also suffered a bit in AVX
workloads but again AMD a promising
architectural improvements with their
gen rise in to tackle this the big
question of course will be gaming
performance will third generations
architectural changes allow these CPUs
to produce gaming performance that
matches productivity performance will
dbt Intel CPUs in gaming or come close
to beating it how these chips fare here
I think will be a huge talking point
given the historic weaknesses of Rison
in this area the other area of interest
to me will be value especially given how
cheap second gen rice and processes are
these days while launch prices between
third gen and second gen are very
similar I'm curious as to whether the
performance games will match the price
increase relative to today's lower
prices and over the next few months how
available will these CPUs be and will
they receive discounts like second gen
especially for hot products like risin 5
