days ago you might have seen our
overclocking examination of the GeForce
r-tx 2080 Ti
well today we're going to be discussing
the RT X 2080 we'll be covering
everything from how to overclock these
cards a look at the Nvidia scanner
typical achievable clock speeds and
performance if your overclocked to GPU
before a lot of the things we go through
in the guide section of this video will
be pretty familiar to you though
depending on what GPU you last overclock
there might be a few new interesting
things to note and of course if you're
more interested in things like final
overclocked performance and clock speeds
you can just skip over the instructional
section also if you watched our 20 atti
video on overclocking expect to see most
of the guide section essentially
rehashed as it's all very similar to
start off this video I'll be going
through our standard methodology for
overclocking Nvidia graphics cards the
card we're using today is the founders
Edition r-tx 2080 which does come
factory overclocked compared to base
level board partner models but the OC is
quite small just 19 megahertz on the
core and nothing on the memory but the
card we're using doesn't really matter
the steps you see here will apply to all
our TX 2080 cards so the first thing
we'll be doing is going through
potentially the easiest method of
overclocking your our TX 2080 and that's
using invidious new scanner API
one-click overclocking has been around
for a while but this time Nvidia has
built a framework for doing it rather
than letting board partners create their
own algorithms and according to Nvidia
their framework is better trained for
their GPUs more accurate and more
reliable than any previous one-click
methods as with the our TX 20 80 TI
we're using MSI Afterburner here as it
was the more reliable of the tools we
used after you've installed and opened
afterburner you'll see a bunch of dials
and sliders but what you want to click
on is the small bar graph icon to the
left of the core clock slider and this
stage is not necessary to touch anything
else in the app simply click on the
Biograph icon then click OC scanner and
then in that window hit scan now you can
sit back and wait a while because the
one-click overclocked process takes
around 15 to 20 minutes what the scanner
is doing is basically running a bunch of
clock speed tests at a range of voltages
to find the exact voltage frequency
curve for your
t-80 model has its own test algorithm
built-in to stress the GPU with the
ability to recover from any hangs or
crashes if the GPU is being pushed a bit
too hard
it's basically simulating what we'd do
with a manual overclock but doing it
faster and potentially more accurately
don't worry if the application hangs or
goes black temporarily during the
process that's normal at the end you'll
be given an average overclock but
crucially you'll get a full frequency
curve which potentially is a bit more
efficient than a simple core frequency
offset you can see at the lower end of
the voltage curve we're getting slightly
higher overclock so than at the top
on average we achieved plus 113
megahertz but at the top-end loc is just
plus 90 megahertz or so at this point
would recommend heading back into the
afterburner main application and
cranking up the power and temperature
limits to the maximum
we've never been chucked a card and even
a last generation Pascal card that
didn't like having these limits raised
all the way so if the 2080 it just makes
sense to crank it up
this will allow invidious GPU boost
algorithm to push as high as possible on
top of the frequency curve we've already
set often going beyond the old limit one
thing to note here is we have set the
power and temperature limit after
running Nvidia scanner Nvidia says the
scanner only modifies the core clock so
if you change the power and temperature
limits beforehand the scanner might find
different and potentially higher core
clocks however in our experience we
actually achieve lower clocks in the
scanner setting the power limit
beforehand so recommend cranking it up
after the scanner is complete the other
obvious limitation is the lack of memory
clock gains Nvidia scanner only handles
the GPU core and doesn't touch the
memory so if you're after that simple
one-click overclock solution you'll be
missing out on any games you'd get from
tweaking memory core overclocking is
much more important for getting
performance gains but a boost of memory
can help out in some situations so we've
got the scanner OC results now in the
bag let's show you how to perform a
manual overclock and after that we'll
compare the manual overclock to the
scanner results for this we're switching
to EVGA precision x1 because it has a
much nicer and more intuitive interface
from manual overclock we want to start
from a decent point so again we're going
to crank the power limit and temperature
limit to the maximum we're also going to
scroll to the bottom section across to
the temper tuner and adjust the curve so
we're getting the maximum clock speed
and all possible temperatures from here
it's all about adjusting the two main
sliders from memory
and core frequency the basic steps are
we want to increase each value by a
reasonable amount apply the overclock
then validate it in a program like
3dmark to ensure we're not getting
crashes at those settings the amount you
increase the values is up to you but
note that you're not going to damage
your car by choosing your value that's
too high instead you'll just crash your
system and have to reset it so not a
really big deal so for the twenty eighty
we started with around a plus one
hundred megahertz offset on the core and
plus 650 or the memory those are fairly
conservative figures for this card that
worked in 3dmark so he pushed the core
up to plus 130 and memory up to plus 700
if you want to play it more safe we'd
recommend only changing one of those
values per test run but again the more
you become familiar with the process the
more you can adjust at once with plus
130 on the core our twenty eighty
crashed in 3dmark so it's now a process
of finding the exact limit we step down
in ten megahertz increments eventually
discovering that plus 120 with unstable
but plus 110 was perfectly fine from
here we can try to push up the memory
even further using a similar sort of
process but in the end RM plus 700 was
right on the limit so our final stable
overclocks for this card were plus one
ten megahertz on the core and plus 700
megahertz on the memory that's a fairly
typical figure going on what we've seen
from others note that if you have a non
efi on non factory OC card the core
offset you'll need will be higher as
you're coming from a lower styling point
once you find what you think is stable
overclocks again it's always a good idea
to validate them further in a game
running for several hours something very
GPU intensive while three max times Phi
gives a good indication of whether a car
will work at a certain frequency
sometimes it will only crash under a
longer test so it's better to test both
a quick note on voltage and videos
training cards are voltage locked in
other words Nvidia does not expose
proper voltage controls to the user like
you might get with overclocking a CPU on
a motherboard instead we have a voltage
slider but it's not really an offset
well if it really does is raise the
voltage limit by a few steps but still
within what Nvidia deems safe in
practice though raising the voltage
slider did absolutely nothing for our
overclock so it's not even worth using
our final results from manual
overclocking did give us slightly higher
clocks around plus one 10 megahertz on
the core compared to plus 90 megahertz
we also overclocked the memory which the
OTA scanner does not handle whatsoever
and that provides an Adu
performance boost instead of the Tomb
Raider for example the results from
using just the scanner gave us a four
percent performance improvement over the
Effie clocks Rosa Manuel overclocked
Brewster performance by eight percent
however one easy trip for those used in
the OC scanner might be to use a fairly
conservative memory overclock for
simplicity's sake something like plus
600 megahertz going with that changes
the results makes the scanner plus
memory overclock seven percent faster
than the FA clocks but again the full
manual overclock provides a slightly
better result so now we've shown that
our manual overclock is very slightly
superior to the results with the OC
scanner now let's take a look at a
handful of games to see how that
overclock compares to both stock and
felonies additional performance in
shadow of the Tomb Raider running 4k
with the maximum quality settings and
SMA 82 X we saw overclocking provide 11%
more performance than the standard
clocks for the 2080 and a percent more
than the founders edition clocks that's
an okay result not quite as grew the
overclocked results for the 2080 ti but
the 2080 is clocked higher by default in
both chips appear to have the same sort
of clock speed cap in Assassin's Creed
origins at 4k ultrahigh preset the
margins are a little narrower 10%
performance increased over the default
clocks and 7% over the founders edition
in Far Cry 5 we're looking at 11% over
the default and 10% over the fairness
edition in Middle Earth shadow of war
there was a 12% improvement over default
and 11% over founders edition and
finally in Batman Arkham Knight 11% over
default and 8% over founders edition so
from those five games we achieved a
performance improvement of 11% on
average compared to stop clocks and 9%
compared to the founders edition clocks
we're pretty much running into a power
limit here looking at the design of the
power delivery on the FE cards there
might be a bit more Headroom available
if Nvidia properly unlocked voltage
controls but this is around as good as
we're getting for what we can configure
at the moment in terms of temperatures
and fan speeds again what Steve found in
this initial review of the 2080 is
spot-on compared to what I achieved on
my test bench core temperatures
increased from 76 degrees Celsius under
load with the founders edition clocks to
81 degrees Celsius when overclocked
that's a bit below the cards in native
84 sea temperature limit and well below
the increased 88 CD limit so it's pretty
clear that's not going to be a limiting
factor for performance fan speeds as
well
twenty sixty rpm with the fa clocks 21 a
TRP
when overclocked using the default auto
fan speed so a slight increase there but
there's really no difference to the
sound profile the card is pretty quiet
went overclocked also of course both the
noise output and temperatures will be
different with board partner models and
if you're wondering about power
consumption while there wasn't a lot of
difference in load power draw between
the default and founders edition clock
so that shouldn't be a huge surprise
consuming the FE clocks only slightly
faster but when overclock power draw
increases by around 13% on average
compared to what the FE clocks draw so a
13% increase in power consumption for 9%
more performance again that's a fairly
typical result if you're wondering about
the actual clock speeds I achieved I was
averaging around 17 70 megahertz in
shadow of the Tomb Raider with the stock
clocks 1865 megahertz with the FA clocks
and 1990 megahertz went overclocked with
the peak around 20 10 megahertz one last
thing you might be interested in are the
clock speeds we achieve when the fan
speeds are set to maximum which could be
an indication of how liquid cooling
might benefit the 2080 however results
are a bit disappointing dropping the
card by only 20 degrees Celsius to
around a tick over 60 degrees under load
I only gained around 50 megahertz to
sustained clock speeds which was a 2%
performance increase over a standard
overclock from multiple times the noise
output of course overall that was the
difference between 8% and 9.5% more
performance over FA clocks so not a
whole lot for a massive temperature drop
so that just about wraps up this look
into 2080 overclocking with the cards we
have on hand they use some extra
performance to squeeze out but again
nothing too different from our 2080 ti
in fact I was able to reuse a bunch of
stuff from that video which is nice
makes our job creating this content it'd
be easier sorry if you saw some of those
sections repeated if you've watched both
videos and again the Nvidia scanner API
seems to be quite ok especially if you
combine it with their conservative
memory overclock if you're interested
