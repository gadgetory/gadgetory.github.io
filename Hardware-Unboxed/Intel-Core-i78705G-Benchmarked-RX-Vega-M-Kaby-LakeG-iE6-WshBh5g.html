we're finally going to explore KB lake G
one of the most interesting pieces of
hardware to come from Intel in a while
this is the first ever chip that
combines an Intel CPU and an AMD GPU
onto the one piece of silicon forming
what is essentially the fastest APU
style processor on the market it's not
quite the same as an APU or SOC and I'll
discuss that in just a moment but it
does bring together a powerful CPU and
highly capable GPU onto a single compact
trip by now you might have seen a bit of
coverage of Intel's KB like gene nook
otherwise known as Hades Canyon that was
the first cable HG product to hit the
market but as a nook it's a bit of a
niche product and most reviewers got
access to just the very top end model
with the fastest KB like gsq inside
considering KB like G is mostly designed
for mobile devices like laptops where
the top-end SKU is unlikely to be used
to review this chip we really wanted to
get our hands on the processor inside an
actual laptop as a more common SKU and
that is what we'll be talking about in
this video the process that we have on
hand to review is the core i7 80 705 G
which is one of the 65 what cable HD
variants as opposed to the full 100 watt
units seen in the Nook there are already
two laptops used the 65 watt model and
moving forward if any more laptops are
going to use cable a tree it's far more
likely they'll be choosing a 65 watt
model like the 87 o5g rather than the
hundred watt 88 o9 g used in the Nook so
the benchmarks we'll get to in a little
bit should provide a good idea of how KB
like GE will perform for most users I've
tested the 87 or 5g inside the Dell XPS
15 to in one which is a 15-inch slim and
light laptop that also packs 16
gigabytes of dual-channel ddr2 400 since
the best use cases for koa are these
sorts of swimming like laptops again
we'll be getting a good idea of how the
chip performs in a typical usage
scenario so let's explore KB leg G the
lineup and its specs before we head into
the performance numbers the chip itself
does contain both an Intel CPU and AMD
GPU on the one package but it's not
nation of both into the one died instead
there are actually two dies on the
package one is a quad-core Intel CPU
with integrated HD graphics and the
other is a Radeon rx Vega M GPU with up
to 24 compute units sitting alongside
four gigabytes of HBM to memory the two
dies are connected through eight lanes
of pcie 3.0 and the GPU is connected to
its HBM to through what Intel calls the
embedded multi die interconnect or mmm
you can see in this picture exactly how
the dies are laid out on the chip the
Intel CPU sits away to the right while
the AMD GPU and HBM to sit on left the
HBM to chip is separate to the GPU is
you can just make out and it's between
those chips that Intel's email comes
into play there are five KB Lake G SKUs
in total split neatly into verts with a
100 watt TDP and those with a 65 watt
TDP the 100 watt SKUs use Vega mgh
graphics which is a fully unlocked
version of the GPU with 24 compute units
a base clock of 1063 megahertz that
boost to eleven ninety megahertz the 65
watt variants use Vega mg/l graphics
which cuts the GPU down to 20 compute
units and lowers clock speeds to 931
megahertz base and 101 one megahertz
boost and that's really the main
difference between 100 watt and 65 watt
chips the extra power Headroom gives you
more see use and higher clocks for
better GPU performance the CPU is pretty
much the same across all five SKUs we're
looking at four cores and eight threads
with minor variations to clock speeds
between the models the core i7 8700 5g
we're looking at today is caught in a
3.1 gigahertz base with a maximum turbo
clock of 4.1 gigahertz on a single core
that drops to 3.9 3.8 and 3.7 gigahertz
in 2 3 and 4 core workloads respectively
the exact same CPU is used in the 87 o
9g but that chip features the top-end 24
Cu Vega variant the top-end 8800 9g
bumps the CPU clock speeds up slightly
from there and at the bottom end we have
the core i5 8305 G which reaches lowest
CPU clock speeds and less l3 cache but
the same 20 Cu Vega GPU as the 87 or 5g
we are looking at today
and the core i7 80 706 G is the odd one
out it's the exact same at the area 705
to you from a spec perspective except it
has Intel's enterprise features like V
Pro and trusted execution technology
enabled the 88 o 9g is the only
overclockable chip in case you are
wondering
as for HBM two configurations all KB
like G chips come with 4 gigabytes on a
1024 bit bus but the 100 what excuse
have that memory clocked at 800
megahertz compared to 700 megahertz on
the 65 watt models all KB like G's
queues also come with Intel HD graphics
integrated into the CPU die it's the
standard HD 630 GPU clocked up to 1,100
megahertz
the idea here is that when you're on
battery the laptop can switch off the
more power-hungry AMD GPU entirely and
just run on the integrated graphics and
when the discrete AMD GPU is required it
can be powered up for far superior
graphics performance the final thing I
want to discuss before getting into
performance is the power split between
the CPU and GPU the 8700 5g has a 65
watt TDP in total however the pl/1 power
limit for the CPU in other words the
sustained power draw limit to the CPU is
capped to 47 watts in the Dell XPS 15 to
in one that makes perfect sense to is
Intel's quad-core KB Lake H series CPUs
had a 45 watt TDP and KB Lake G ups the
clocks by around 300 megahertz across
the board this gives the GPU at the very
least in sustained workloads our full 18
watts to work with in actual practice
when the GPU and CPU are fully utilized
the GPU will run above 18 watts and a
cpu below 47 months depending on the
requirements like with any SOC
algorithms determine how much power is
allocated to each part of the chip
depending on the workload but you can
see just in the pl/1 limit that there is
always some Headroom left for the GPU
even under full CPU learn so how does Kb
Lake cheaper form we'll start with the
CPU performance then move into the GPU
later with the CPU the most important
comparisons between the core i7 8700 5g
and intel's previous and current
generation 8 seriously used in
particular the i7 7700 HQ and the i
78750 H both a 45 watt CPU similar to
the power available to the a 705 G CPU
the 7700 HT with the same four calls
while the
8750 H bumps it up to six cause looking
at Cinebench r15 we can see that in the
multi-threaded test the 8700 5g holds a
decent eight percent performance
advantage over the 7700 HQ using its
higher clocked cause to its advantage in
the single threaded test it pushes this
imagine out to 13% again thanks to
better boost clocks however it's in the
multi-threaded test that the six core
8750 H dominates as expected with two
extra cores the coffee like CPU is 46
percent faster it's a similar story in
the handbrake x265 encoding test the
8700 5g is a mere 2% faster than the
7700 HQ but gets punished to the tune of
27 percent against the 8750 H having
those extra cores in intel's newer H
series CPUs really helps in these
intensive encoding tests where cable 8g
appears to be stuck with last gen CPU
technology in Microsoft Excel the 8700
5g is 3 percent faster than the 7700 HQ
but falls 33% behind the a 750 H again
this is down to the 87 50 H having more
cores which is a large advantage most
modern multi-threaded workloads do D 705
G does hold a handy performance
advantage in 7 zips compression and
decompression benchmarks to the tune of
13 and 8% respectively compared to the
7700 H cube however once again the 8750
h comes in and smashes the 8700 5g
achieving 38 and 57% more performance in
these tests there's a pretty clear trend
here and it's not one that favors K bhe
over coffee like H in mixed workloads we
start to get a good look at how the CPU
and GPU combination stacks up when
accelerating a premiere encode with
lumetri effects the 87 o5g competes
strongly with gaming laptops that pack
faster GPUs the combination of a 7700 HQ
and GTX 1060 is not seen in slim and
light notebooks like the Dell XPS 15 2
in one yet KB Lake G is only 20% slower
here photo drops accelerate an iris blur
effect is another of that even with a
much more powerful 6 core CPU and gtx
1070 max-q GPU it's only 28% faster
across most CPU limited workloads though
there is a pretty clear trend the 8700
5g is marginally ahead
of the core i7 7700 HQ thanks to its
slightly increased clock speeds but it
lacks those extra cause of the 8750 h as
such the 8750 h is often at least 40%
faster in crucial workloads like video
rendering let's take a closer look at
the Vega
M GPU included with the core i7 87 or 5g
because that's where a lot of the
interest will lie in particular be
interesting to see how the Vega M GPU
with 20 compute units stacks up against
other popular discrete GPU options like
the GTX 1015 I want to start with 3d
marks entire suite of tests here because
I think it paints a really interesting
picture of how KB Lake G stands up
against the GTX 1050 combined with the
7700 HQ unfortunately I don't have data
for an AC 750 H and GT x 1050 combo just
yet but hopefully I'll be able to follow
up on that soon in any case with the
more CPU demanding tests like Cloud Gate
and sky diver KB Lake G is clearly
behind the 7700 HQ with the discrete GTX
1050 in the overall score for Cloud Gate
the 8700 5g is nearly ten percent behind
the GTX 1050 however as you move into
more GPU intensive tests the 8700 5g
pulls well ahead and in the top tier
times by test the Vega equipped
processor is now 16% ahead in the
overall score and 17 percent faster in
the graphics core this paints a good
picture for Kb like Jays game aspectus
games are mostly going to be GPU bound
on a GPU in the class of a 20 cu Vega
for GPU computer heavy workloads as well
you can expect cable 8g to outperform of
gtx 1050 and fall just below a GTX and
50 Ti they're clearly well behind a gtx
1066 gigabyte similar results to 3d mark
escena now to GTA 5 game tests when
playing on knee maximum settings to
1080p which is quite GPU intensive the
8700 5g pulls 26% ahead although both
systems are sub 30 FPS at this point
using medium settings however the GTX
1050 gains an eight percent performance
advantages the game loads up the CPU to
a greater degree although you can
clearly see with an 80 FPS average the
GTA 5 is playable on cable 8g in rise of
the Tomb Raider the gtx 1050 combo does
slightly outperformed cable 8g using
DirectX 12 and high settings of 1080p to
the tune of 6%
this is a game that
class of GPU tends to struggle with and
to get a good gaming experience I'd
recommend turning down the quarry levels
further in Deus Ex mankind divided the
chorus of an 87 over 5g is a good eight
percent faster than our discrete gtx
1050 congo at 1080p using the high
preset
it's also worth discussing where cable
8g falls relative to GPUs more commonly
found in gaming laptops using a newer
game testing suite you can see the 8700
5g provides almost exactly half the
performance of the GTX 1066 gigabyte in
Assassin's Creed origins using the
medium preset at 1080p it's a similar
story in games like watchdogs 2 and prey
you're going to get around half the
framerate of a genuine gtx 1060 gaming
laptop if you're interested in a more
detailed look at how cable a cheaper
forms for gaming in a laptop form factor
I'll be doing a follow up that will go
through a ton more games and show if
they're playable or not and what quality
levels but in general the 8700 5g in
this sort of form factor provides a
decent entry to mid-level gaming
experience with performance between that
over gtx 1050 and gtx 750ti discrete GPU
though closer to a 1050 Ti and more GPU
intensive games so we've seen all the
performance numbers and how KB Lake G
stacks up to a range of hardware and
I've got to say I'm pretty impressed
with what you tell us managed to achieve
here it's not gonna blow your socks off
with screaming fires levels of
performance but with the chorus of an 87
or 5g we're getting a CPU that's a bit
faster than a core i7 7700 HQ and a GPU
in the GTX 1050 to 1050 Ti range on a
single chip and all that goodness fits
into a TDP that makes the chip suitable
for use in slim and light notebooks it's
basically the fastest single chip
compute solution available with a great
balance of CPU and GPU power and that's
all been made possible through combining
Intel solid high-end mobile CPU with a
powerful GPU from AMD a strange
combination for sure and something I
didn't think we never see but here we I
it exists and it's definitely quite
compelling
however while the core i7 8700 5g is an
interesting technical achievement it's
Competitiveness up against other
potential hardware combinations for
ultra-thin laptops is a bit questionable
and I think a lot of that comes down to
Intel almost shooting themselves in the
foot through the inclusion of
odd core CPU rather than going all that
with the six core coffee-like CPU by not
including the latest CPU technology in
this fascinating APU type product and
then releasing it alongside new faster
CPUs in turn is basically allowed a CPU
plus discrete GPU option to better
compete with KB Lake G than it otherwise
could have take the combination of a
core i7
8750 H and discrete nvidia geforce gtx
750ti the very combination you'll get
with the latest Dell XPS 15 with this
combo you'll get slightly more GPU power
than the core i7 87 or 5g with Vega mg/l
but crucially you get two extra cores
and 40 to 50% more CPU power and that's
one of Intel's own products directly
competing against and providing a better
option than cable 8g of course competing
your performance is only one part of the
story it also comes down to price and
power consumption in a lot of cases
unfortunately right now it appears cable
hg is more expensive to integrate than
the 8750 h plus gtx 750ti for a lower
level of performance while not a direct
apples to apples comparison the XPS 15 2
in one with kb lake g is 250 dollars
more expensive than an otherwise
identically configured XPS 15 with the
8750 h and 1050 TI inside even when
factoring in a rough $100 price premium
for the two-in-one design the exact
margin news for Dells 13-inch variants
kb lake g is adding to the total system
cost or at best costing as much as the
8750 h plus 1050 TI combo option there
may be some power savings to be had with
kb lake g but right now it seems that
the thin and light notebook cooler in a
15 inch system like the Dell XPS 15 line
is quite capable of dealing with the
power consumption of either this
processor or the 8750 H paired with the
1050 Ti while I tend to think the ad 750
h+ GTX 1052 I will offer more
performance and a better experience for
laptop owners
I don't think Kb like G or the cry 787
o5g is completely useless
the single chip design of cable hg
provides a clear space advantage over
two separate chips and additional V Ram
modules if properly harnessed this is
manically - more space for other
components
like batteries and storage drives or it
could bring this level of performance to
smaller devices either of those things
would be a huge win and would allow KB
like G to occupy market segments that
8750 H+ 1050 t I could not service in
product shipping right now though like
the Dell XPS 15 2 in one I don't think
that advantage is being fully utilized
there's also a lot of promise to this
single-chip large GPU design and I think
a second generation to this product line
could be highly competitive simply
upgrading the CPU to a six core design
or whatever Intel is using in their top
and H series chips at the time along
with refining the GPU to squeeze a bit
more out of the power envelope will do
wonders for this processor it's not
unusual to see teething issues with the
first gen product like this especially
when it's competing against a refined
product offering but I'm pretty excited
to see what will happen in the future
anyway those are my thoughts on KB Lake
G and the 65 watt variant shipping in
laptops today stay tuned for a deeper
