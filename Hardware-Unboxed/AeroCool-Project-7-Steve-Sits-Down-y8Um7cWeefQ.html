last of my Computex coverage it's been a
fun week but I'm keen to get home and
back to benchmarking some new hardware
but before I do that here's a look at
some really comfortable upcoming
products from Aero cool if you're in the
market for a new gaming desktop PC then
check out MSI's high end core i7 systems
also right now they are offering a free
you play game key for Tom Clancy's Ghost
Recon wildlands with select purchases
it's also possible to score a wildland
game code with select MSI motherboards
check out their x99 - Dead 270 at h2 70
range link is in the video description
this year at Computex arrow cool had a
heap of really fun and exciting products
to check out their thunder x3 brand is
getting complete revamp soon they'll be
releasing the a h7 headset a m7 and our
m5 mice along with the a k7 keyboard so
I jumped in one of the new project 7
gaming chairs which I will get to in a
minute and gave their headset along with
the keyboard and mouse ago I quickly
realized I was actually on Greg sellers
arse editing rig yeah the guy has his
own editing rig on the showroom floor I
tried to log into his password-protected
account to mess with his project file
but I couldn't get his password
it wasn't Core i5 seriously though
Greg's a really nice guy and was great
to meet him in person at the show
getting back on track their headsets at
securely on my head and felt very
comfortable the sound quality was also
very good of course the cans are RGB lit
on the outside and on the inside they
feature 50 millimeter drivers then we
have the am7 Mouse which is designed for
right or left-handed gamers so it is an
ambidextrous form factor this new
Thunder x3 Mouse is supported by the hex
software which allows gamers to
customize the mouse at the heart of the
am7 is the pmw 3360 sensor supporting up
to 12,000 dpi the clickers use Omron
switches allowing for at least 20
million clicks the our m5 is designed
for right-hand gamers and is suited well
to either the palm or claw grip this
time we find a pmw 3325 sensor
supporting a DPI of 5000 along with the
same Omron gaming switches finally the
last Thunder x3 product is the slim
McHale
equal gaming keyboard which arrow cool
tells us is inspired by supercar vents
so yeah there's that
anyway I quite like the aluminium panel
with floating key cap design in addition
to the RGB keys there is also an RGB LED
strip that runs across the top and
bottom of the keyboard the AEK seven
features a detachable wrist refs and
dedicated macro keys just as I was
wrapping things up Gregg came back and
kicked me off your system before I
completely handed things back over to
Greg though I did check out the project
seven arrow calls latest and greatest
gaming seat now let's just get this
little detail out of the way this is an
RGB chair so yeah it has RGB lighting
that said it is anything but a gimmick
well the RGB lighting things might be
gimmick but the seat itself is amazing
so the RGB lighting is provided by a
cable that runs around the edge of the
seat and I have to say well completely
unnecessary it does look kind of cool so
I guess that's the point
anyway the chair was super comfortable
and the predominantly black material
looks great
Eero cool says it's made from a
high-quality leatherette the molded foam
pads and backrest felt great and I have
to say this is one of the more
comfortable gaming seats I've sat on and
at home I do use the ergo human it can
also handle big units as well with a
maximum load rating of 150 kilos
heroical also had some really awesome
lounge type couches on display they were
also really comfortable that no details
were really given I assume these are
products that will be going on sale soon
but I'm not 100% sure either way Brian
and I enjoyed having a sit-down and
watching people walk around the booth
while we relaxed also on display was the
new 7 PC one pro and p7c zero pro cases
the p7c 1 pro looked great and included
a p7 h1 controller along with three 120
millimeter RGB fans this is a mid-range
case sporting a tempered glass side
panel and it comes in either white or
black they also had their new p7 650 W
power supply which was developed in
collaboration with tech power the unit
certified and recognized by cybernetics
to be dead silent with an A+ plus rating
the PS use design to work efficiently
with an ambient room temperature of 60
degrees Celsius and it does include high
quality Japanese capacitors and lastly I
should note it has an RGB controllable
fan once we finished checking out all
the products it was back to the comfy
lounge chairs for a quick relax before
we got back to work I really hope you
guys enjoyed checking out the new arrow
cool and thunder x3 products with me I'm
your host Steve I'll see you again soon
