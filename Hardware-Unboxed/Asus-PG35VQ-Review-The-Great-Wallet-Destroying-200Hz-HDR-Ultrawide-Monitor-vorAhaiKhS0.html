of people the gaming monitor I'm looking
at today has been a long time coming it
was first shown off at Computex 2017
it was then delayed repeatedly and
finally in the middle of 2019 it will be
available to buyers shortly I'm of
course talking about the Asuza rog swift
PG 35 VQ you've all seen the time of
this video and boy is there a lot of
content to fit into this review so to
start with the PG 35 V cube is one of
several designs along with an Acer and
AOC model that's based off a new super
high-end ultra wide HDR capable panel
from a you Optronics the specs are
extremely impressive a 35 inch 34 40 by
1440 curved VA panel and up to 200 Hertz
for starters that's a significant
increase on the refresh rate
capabilities of these 1440p class ultra
whites and then on top of that we're
getting proper HDR functionality through
a 512 zone full array local dimming
backlight 1000 nits of peak brightness
and 90% DSO ip3 coverage and the cherry
on top is chasing ultimate support all
of that comes at an enormous price tag a
soos wouldn't confirm exactly how much
this will cost in the US Australia given
its still a few weeks away from
launching officially but it is up for
pre-order in the UK for 2,700 pounds
which were put in in the 2500 to 3,000
US dollar range when you account for tax
so yeah certainly quite a pricey monitor
but before that this video is brought to
you by raid Shadow legends the latest
hero collect a role-playing game that
you can play on your phone right now for
free it has an amazing storyline awesome
3d graphics seriously check out the
level of detail on these characters plus
they're a giant boss fights and more
than 400 champions for you to collect
and customize this game reminds me a lot
of classic RPGs and the strategy games
plus it's growing fast and is expected
to receive a huge update this month
which will add even more fun for new
players with a 4.6 star rating on the
Play Store from over 150,000 reviews
this is the best time to join the action
so what are you waiting for click the
links in the
and below and you'll instantly get
50,000 silver and a free epic champion
as part of the new player program to
start your journey now let's get back to
the video anyway lots to cover here so
let's get into the basics the design
it's very similar to a Seuss's previous
rog swift designs and once again not a
huge fan personally I prefer a more
sleek and minimalist aesthetic as soos
has historically gone with these more
heavy gamer designs I get why they do it
but the crazy patterns on the back and
copper highlights on the stand just
don't really get me excited RGB is still
present here you get a larger soos our
og logo on the back a projected light
that comes out at the bottom of the
stand and an additional light in the top
of the stand a lot of these elements you
won't see in standard operation or you
can just to say but like I did build
quality again stared for a soos the
stand is very sturdy and uses metal for
the legs but the rest of the housing is
just basic plastic in a few different
textures I am happy that the bezel size
is a lot smaller than the previous 27
inch chasing ultimate displays though
there's a decent amount of functionality
here the stand supports height tilt and
swivel adjustment as you'd expect from a
premium on etre there's also a visor
mounting compatibility if you need it
for ports you get hdmi 2.0 and
DisplayPort 1.4 you should be using
DisplayPort here plus there's a two port
USB hub and a 3.5 mm audio output jack
doan screen display is controlled
through a directional toggle for the
most part and there's a lot of features
in here to access the 200 Hertz mode you
have to enable that in here the monitor
ships with a default max refresh rate of
180 Hertz so that's something to keep in
mind then there's a number of color
controls backlight controls
HDR features and so on that I'll mention
throughout the review plus game of
specific features like cheat crosshairs
FPS counters and more everything you
used to with masseuse ROG monitor like
the Zeus PG 27 uq and other similar
g-sync ultimate monitors the PG 35 eq
does require active cooling there's a
small fan built into an area near the
inputs but it's noticeably quieter than
the fans that shipped with PG 27-year
cube instead of being audible almost all
the time the PG 35 V Q is basically
silent you will hear the fan in a very
quiet room but in most conditions it
will be drowned out by other noise and
to be honest it's basically a non-issue
unless you ever unless you must have the
silent room let's move into before
now and obviously one of the big
features here is the 200 Hertz refresh
rate which is a first for 34 40 by 1440
ultra wines previously the capita these
monitors was 144 Hertz you can get that
with monitors from LG and soon MSI for
around $1000 but for some 144 Hertz may
not be future proof enough so now we
have 200 Hertz available in this monitor
the good news is DisplayPort 1.4 has
enough bandwidth for 34 40 by 1440 at
200 Hertz with 8-bit color this is in
stark contrast to the 27 inch 4k 144
Hertz HDR panels which were kept to 120
Hertz with 8-bit color and needed chroma
subsampling at 144 Hertz there's really
no need for chroma subsampling at all
with the PG 35v q and you can happily
use this in an SDR configuration at 200
Hertz for HDR gaming the bandwidth limit
for uncompressed 10-bit HD are at 34 40
by 1440 is 144 Hertz above that say you
want to play HDI games at 200 Hertz you
have one of two options you could use
chroma subsampling or you could drop
down the monitor to 8-bit color with HDR
which is the default behaviour here now
you might be thinking hang on a moment
don't you need 10-bit color for HDR and
the answer is kind of yes and kind of no
while 10-bit color is one of the
improvements HDR is designed to make
over SDR and is part of the HDR 10th
standard there's actually nothing
stopping you from dropping down to 8-bit
while maintaining HDR support with a
wide color gamut and increased contrast
10-bit color merely increases the number
of colors to 1.0 7 billion and helps
smooth out gradients to reduce banding
but it isn't a requirement for any other
aspect of HDR video for the most part a
10 bit source can be shrunk down to 8
bit with minimal quality loss I tried
many games in the HDR mode with both
8-bit and 10-bit color and really
couldn't notice any differences
whatsoever in fact in games that did
have some color banding with gradients
that banding was still present in the 10
bit mode given the panel itself is still
a native 8-bit panel with FRC 4 10 bit
support I don't think there's a
significant downside to running this
display at 8-bit HDR at 200 Hertz that
said your mileage may vary especially
for HD
films which is a bit of a different
story to games and if you do notice some
gradient banding it could be worth
dropping down to 144 Hertz to gain a
10-bit color support for me though the
simplest solution is to run the monitor
at 200 Hertz with 8-bit color where I
was in the SDR or HDR modes the visual
quality was excellent and far better
than what you get of chroma subsampling
was required in fact I'm stoked that you
can use the full capabilities of this
panel without having to mess around with
subsampling as for 200 Hertz itself to
my eyes it is a big step up from 100
Hertz in terms of smoothness and a
lesser but still somewhat noticeable
step up from 144 Hertz the main question
is whether you have the GPU horsepower
to drive games at this resolution and
refresh rate as of today with an RT X 20
atti you can get 150 to 200 FPS in games
like fortnight and other less intensive
eSports ish titles but with big triple-a
games on Ultra settings 100 FPS isn't
more realistic target of course you can
tweak the settings for better
performance but this is with the 2080 TR
anyone with a lower tier GPU will face
an uphill battle to even hit above 144
FPS that said upgrade cycles for
monitors along and so having something
that does 200 Hertz now is going to be
right at the top of the market for years
to come and will let you enjoy many new
GPU upgrades without maxing out the
capabilities of your monitor I feel this
sort of future proofing is more the goal
of offering 200 Hertz now which makes
sense given the enormous cost of this
display and as it supports a g-sync
ultimate of course you will get a smooth
experience if your frame rates are well
below 200 FPS so with chroma subsampling
a non-issue with this monitor the next
question is whether this VA panel is
actually capable of a 200 Hertz refresh
rate given response timers tend to be an
issue with VA s I was super curious to
see where the AU Optronics could deliver
the required sub 5.0 millisecond
response times for a true 200 Hertz
experience before showing you the
numbers response times are a really
interesting situation with this panel as
this monitor has an F Ald backlight
response times are actually governed by
two aspects the response time of the
liquid crystals which is the usual
determining factor for overall response
times as well as the response of the
backlight and this is crucial because
the page 35 VQ has different response
behavior depending on whether the
dynamic backlight is
in abled or disabled with the FA LD
backlight enabled the best overdrive
mode to use is extreme with this mode
enabled there are some good benefits
overshoot is well managed and often
non-existent and there's not much dark
level smearing from very slow dark
transition times however the FA LD
backlights full time is a little slow on
the tail end in some instances which
pushes out some transition times overall
though the average greater grade
transition is six point zero nine
milliseconds a little shy of the 5
millisecond target but considering more
than half of the overall transitions
measured were within that window some as
fast as 2 milliseconds I'd say this is
borderline capable of 200 Hertz and fine
for 144 Hertz with the FA LD backlight
disabled the best overdrive mode to use
is normal as the extreme mode introduces
far too much overshoot with a dynamic
backlight off it seems the extreme mode
has been specifically tweaked to work
well in tandem with the FA LD backlight
which I guess makes sense as most users
will leave it enabled for gaming without
the FLD backlight impacting the tail end
of transitions this combination of
settings has a faster greater grade
average of 4.5 5 milliseconds which is
perfect for 200 Hertz
however the dark level smearing is worse
in this mode than if you leave the FLD
backlight on with extreme overdrive it
also has more overshoot in general
although not to a severe extent so this
pros and cons to each scenario I think
most gamers will leave the dynamic
backlight enabled for non HDR gaming in
which case extreme is the better choice
and 200 Hertz is borderline achievable
for most users this will be fine and
with this combination ghosting smearing
or inverse ghosting isn't much of an
issue despite being a VA panel input lag
results were excellent I measured these
numbers with the dynamic backlight and
gsync enabled and with under 3.0
milliseconds of latency this monitor is
in line with other gaming grade panels
I've tested let's talk a bit about the
backlight now there's 512 individual
zones across this 35 inch panel which is
enough for a solid HDR experience
compared to the 27-inch HDR monitors
with 384 zones each zone is a bit larger
with the ultra wide but this is
mitigated by the use of VA technology
instead of IPS haloing is still present
but it's less noticeable when the
monitor is viewed from in
front it can look a bit worse than up
angles due to the middling viewing
angles of VI panels but in most use
cases the FAL D backlight works better
here than in the PG 27 new q2 do hire a
native contrast for gaming and video
playback in almost all scenarios it's
impossible to notice the FLD backlight
in action especially when set to the
fastest mode which is lightning quick
however it's a mixed bag for
productivity when viewing large areas of
solid colors you can often spot halo
against the white mouse cursor moves
around my recommendation is to leave the
backlight enabled for SDR gaming and
general usage unless the haloing bothers
you in which case you should disable it
for productivity work the HDR experience
from this monitor is outstanding as of
today I'd say this monitor delivers the
best HDR experience of any monitor on
the market including the older 27 inch
4k panels it's not as good as modern TVs
which have the benefit of more mature
HDR technology but for monitors this is
as good as it gets
first up is the checklist every box is
ticked here so it's a true HDR panel the
color space is wider than SDR with 90%
DCI p3 coverage in my testing it was a
little under this but close enough
brightness it's over 1000 its peak and
of course we have the high zone can't F
Ald backlight which provides much better
contrast than SDR monitors digging a
little deeper on the brightness behavior
here is outstanding 814 it's sustained
in a full white window is higher than
the PG 27 YouTube and you get 1000 nits
at 50% which then increases to around
1016 it's at 25% or lower
this panel has a better and more
powerful backlight they can be utilized
up to 1000 nits in more conditions on
top of 840 in its peak it is still
capable of a 1109 white flash across the
entire display which certainly is I
scorching black levels push the tools at
my disposal to the limit the best I can
say here is that the contrast ratio is
at least a hundred thousand to one in
the HDR mode which again is higher than
the chasing ultimate monitors that use
IPS panels so combined with excellent
brightness you get excellent contrast
exactly the intention of HDR displays
there are also far more HDR capable
games these days compared to last year
when I first checked out the PG 27 UQ
both Windows 10 and the
games themselves are slowly improving
how they handle HDR and many titles look
absolutely spectacular when viewed on a
proper HDR monitor like this the
experience is a lot better than the
standard SDR in these games and is quite
hard to capture on camera it's something
you have to see for yourself especially
beside an SDR display with better depth
better contrast and better colors games
look truly amazing on the PG 35 feet q
how about SDR performance well
brightness is capped at around 500 nits
whether the FLD backlight is enabled or
disabled with the dynamic backlight
disabled native contrast is around 20 to
80 to 1 which is weak for a VA but
typical for a you Optronics technology
that said given their feldy backlight
increases the contrast ratio to over
25,000 to one at 200 nits it's a bit of
a non-issue the PG 35 VQ does come with
some degree of factory calibration and a
soos has done a lot of things right here
out of the box there is an SDR mode
gamut switch in the monitors OSD which
defaults to srgb but can be switched to
a wide gamut if you need it for DCI p3
work I'm not going to touch on DCI p3
performance here in detail but it's
about as accurate as the srgb mode srgb
performance is decent out of the box
grayscale performance is really the only
weak point and even then it's still very
good for a gaming class display with the
Delta II average of 2.37 and serviceable
CCT and gamma performance the white
point of around 6300 K is close to being
accurate saturation performance is
strong a delta a average of one point
six two is close to the results as suits
provides on their calibration sheet that
comes in the box color checker results
are also good with a delta average of
one point seven six and again you get
similar sub 2.0 Delta averages in the
wide gamut mode when measuring against
DCI p3 interestingly accuracy actually
decreases if you disable the FLD
backlight it seems the soos has
optimized this monitor for FLD usage
which makes sense given you probably
should be using it in most circumstances
Delta averages pushed to above 2.0 with
default settings with the FLD backlight
disabled it's a small change but it's
one worth noting it is possible to
correcting further with a software icc
profile and some small OSD tweaks but
i'm not going to discuss that in detail
given Delta performance is already boy
to point out of the box it's not quite
at the level of a professional display
but for gamers
this sort of performance is excellent
and isn't worth the hassle of software
profiles uniformity with the FLD
backlight enabled is excellent as well
especially for a curved via ultra wide
panel which tend to be weaker in this
area Center performance is great with
sub 2.0 Delta G's across pretty much the
entire central zone it's only on the
outer edges where things fall away
somewhat which is typical for a
backlight with 512 individual zones this
is a fabulous results and gives a
generally uniform image so that's all
the performance data in obviously lots
to talk about so time to run over just
my general thoughts on this monitor
first up I'm really happy to see that a
number of issues that were present with
the first generation of juicing ultimate
displays like the Zeus PG 27 UQ have
been resolved or somewhat mitigated with
the PG 35 VQ not having to mess around
with chroma subsampling at the highest
refresh rate is a huge bonus
and although you are restricted to 8-bit
color depth above 144 Hertz even for HDR
gaming this was basically a non-issue in
my testing the use of VA technology
along with FA LD backlight has reduced
haloing it is still there but it's
better than first gen III PS panels and
it also brings with it better overall
contrast and the fan while still present
is less obnoxious than with the original
monitors I was also pleased to see that
200 Hertz is a viable refresh rate for
this panel response times vary depending
on the configuration you go with but
with the FA LD backlight enabled which I
think most people opt to use at all
times for gaming 200 Hertz is borderline
doable without much dark level smearing
with the FLD backlight disabled you can
get well within the 200 Hertz barrier
but with worst dark level smearing and
overshoot so it just depends what you're
after overall considering the known
limitations of VA technology this is a
better than expected result other areas
of performance are also top-notch
there's excellent input latency even in
the HDR mode superb HDR brightness
levels decent out of the box calibration
with support for both srgb and wide
gamut modes a great array of OST
features very good uniformly and an
adjustable stand when looking across all
areas of this monitor it has to be the
best I've tested and the best on the
market today it combines a high
resolution that's well suited to gaming
with a top-end refresh rate and throws
in true HDR performance into the mix
with few issues and performance to back
it up it's better than the 27 inch 4k
144 Hertz chasing ultimate monitors in
my opinion although obviously it's a
different format display so it won't
appeals to everyone the only thing it's
really missing is a 4k class resolution
but to pay that with the rest of these
specs is well beyond today's technology
the main issue here is going to be the
price this is a premium monitor and it
shows with a premium price tag of what
I'm assuming will be near the $3,000
mark certainly above 2500 US dollars
going on UK pricing it will likely end
up $1,000 more expensive than the 27
inch 4k juicing ultra monitors if not
more which will keep this entirely in
the range of buyers with deep pockets
and high-end systems to match looking at
the entire display ecosystem today with
this monitor priced at say $3,000 I just
feel it's not great value even though
you're getting the best on the market
it's an extremely high price tag so
higher than for the same money you could
get a very nice 55 inch LG c9 OLED TV
plus a high refresh ultra wide gaming
monitor to me I think a reasonable price
would be fifteen hundred to two thousand
US dollars which is obviously a huge
price cut from what it will actually
cost my reasoning here is that you can
buy a monitor like the LG 34 GK 950 F
right now for about $1,000 which offers
eight 3440 by 1440 resolution at 144
Hertz
without much HDR capabilities so I think
adding five hundred to a thousand
dollars to the price for a higher of
fresh trade and proper HDR sounds fair
unfortunately it will likely be three
times the price when it hits the market
in a few weeks and that will push it out
of reach of even those with high-end
twenty atti gaming rigs if you're buying
a $3,000 monitor you're probably going
to be the sort of person that has a
spare twenty atti in case their current
20 80 TI dies you know the kind of
person that would spend $3,000 without
blinking an eye hopefully the price
drops in the next few years for this
technology because the tech here is
super exciting and I'd love to see it in
the hands of more enthusiasts at a more
reasonable price that's it for this
review of the seuss rog swift PG 35 v2
I'm also hoping to check out the ASA
predator and AOC egg on
when they hit the market but it sounds
like they're a bit behind a Seuss in
getting these panels out subscribe for
