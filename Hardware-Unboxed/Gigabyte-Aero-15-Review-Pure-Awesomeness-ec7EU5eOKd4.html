box sitting beside me today is perhaps
the surprise packet of the year it's the
gigabyte arrow 15 now I've used to bunch
of gigabyte laptops in the past and I
haven't been too impressed so when I got
my hands on the air of 15 I was blown
away by the quality of this laptop not
just for gamers but also for
professionals this is a really solid
device and it's probably the best laptop
that gigabyte has ever made the hardware
inside will be pretty familiar to most
of you we're looking at an Intel Core i7
7700 HQ processor along with an nvidia
geforce gtx 1066 gigabyte GPU so it's
well tuned to 1080p ultra kali gambling
we're also seeing 16 gigabytes of ddr4
memory and a 512 gigabyte SSD in my
review net here there are a couple of
other configurations available depending
on your region with a 4k model coming in
the future but at least as far as most
aro 15s go this is the hardware that
you're beginning as always I want to
start by talking about the design I
think most of you will have noticed
straight away the display I mean it's a
15.6 inch display the gigabyte has gone
with the Dell XPS approach of completely
removing the display bezels leading to
an awesome viewing experience I wish
more gaming laptop manufacturers would
produce laptops with slim bezels we've
seen guys like Razer with the massive
bezels around the display of the Razer
Blade but gigabyte has gone you know
what we don't need bezels in our laptops
bezels don't make any sense we want to
give the best viewing experience
possible let's just get rid of them
let's make the display feel all the
available space and what it's led to
here is an awesome looking device I mean
thanks to the slim bezels gigabyte does
claim the Aero 15 only takes up the
space of a 14 inch laptop I will say it
is slightly larger than my 14 inch razor
blade however it is definitely smaller
than most 15-inch gaming laptops on the
market and it's not just in terms of its
footprint but also in terms of its size
and weight at just 2.1 kilograms and 19
millimeters thick we're looking at a
reasonably portable device now it's not
slimmest or lightest gtx 1060 laptop or
lightest 15.6 inch laptop on the market
MSI's GS 63 VI is slimmer and lighter in
both regards
however we are seeing a much larger
battery in here we're looking at 94 watt
hours and still an extremely portable
device with a smaller footprint than
some of its competitors on the market I
think this is well suited to taking
around four portable workstation use or
whether you just want to game on the go
gigabyte has really hit the nail on the
head with the portable design here with
the arrow 15 the build quality is much
better than most gigabyte laptops I've
used in the past thanks the use of
aluminium around most areas of the
device the lid is reasonably understated
as well no significant amounts of gamer
style here although you can purchase
this laptop also in a green and an
orange variant which are certainly
extremely vibrant though I prefer the
more black and understated look of the
era 15 that I was provided with around
the edges the plastic that they've used
there and the sort of designer has a few
seams isn't as nice as some of the
aluminum unibody with designs of seen
from other companies but it's still far
better than the all plastic bodies the
gigabyte has used in the past and at
least as far as some of the things like
IO are concerned gigabyte has really
nailed it here with things like three
USB 3.0 type-a ports HDMI 2.0 Ethernet
yes full-sized Ethernet inside this 19
millimeter slim laptop of an SD card
slot Thunderbolt 3 USB type-c
and a 3.5 mm audio jack and mini
DisplayPort so a lot of ports to be
found this laptop and for creative
professionals that require that SD card
slot or for those that want to attach
you know multiple displays through one
cable provider through Thunderbolt 3 the
arrow 15 has all of that then you can't
really complain about the i/o that
gigabyte has provided the one downside
to these slim bezel laptop designs is
the positioning of the webcam it has to
be placed below the display on the arrow
15 and it does lead to an awkward angle
sort of those they use their webcam
often you might not be too happy with
the webcam placement here and also the
speaker system in Hera fifteens pretty
tinny although that's to be expected
from most gaming laptops I was pretty
impressed with the keyboard that
gigabyte has included here we are
looking at rubber dome key caps
courses is expecting a laptop this thing
but the travel distance is reasonably
good and has a very cliquey response
that leads to a great typing experience
it's also of course well suited to
gaming and you get full RGB backlighting
support that's customizable through
gigabytes fusion utility not as good as
the Razer synapse utility for you know
adding a whole range of features and
functionality to your RGB keyboard but
you still get a quite a large range of
customizability available here as far as
the trackpad is concerned kike byte has
once again gone for eel and hardware
I've used a ton of eel and track pads in
the past and all of them have been
garbage but on the area of 15 it's
actually surprisingly solid the tracking
experience is good it's not as good as
some of the other options that we've
seen and support for gestures is
reasonable as well which is a big
surprise from the eel and trackpad and
it makes it reasonably easily use on a
day to day basis though of course the
gamers are most professionals I'd still
recommend plugging in an external mouse
to get the most out of the arrow 15 it's
not just games the gigabyte is targeting
for the area of 15 it's also creative
professionals thanks to its x-ray
Pantone display certification x1 is a
well known color calibration company in
fact they make the tools that I used to
test all displays that I receive and
what this certification means is that
the arrow fifteens display is factory
calibrated to the srgb spectrum out of
the box I was a little bit skeptical
because I tend to think color
calibration at the factory doesn't
always work too well but when I got my
hands in the air 50 it blew me away with
its color accuracy as we move into
spectra Cal Cal Man 5 we can see just
how decent this display is 280 nibs of
brightness is a little bit lower than
I'd normally like but a contrast ratio
of 1200 to 1 and reasonable viewing
angles tend to make me think that this
15.6 inch 1080p panel is more IPS than
TN although it is limited to just a 60
Hertz refresh rate but when we're
looking at color accuracy white level
average of 65 20 K is basically dead
accurate and an average grayscale Delta
80 mm value of just 0.5 6 is fantastic
for a laptop this is by far the most
accurate display that I've tested in a
laptop so far with the value of under 1
Oh consider indistinguishable from true
accuracy and therefore suitable for
professional users color performance was
also excellent in our saturation sweeps
the area 15 report on average Delta mm
value of one point one six well in our
custom color checker test we saw an
average value of one point five three so
it doesn't quite hit the under one point
Oh mark that ID like to see if they're
creative professionals but the area
fifteen still blows all the other
offerings on the market completely out
of the water and even with third-party
calibration you can't achieve
significantly superior results to what
the area 15 provides out of the box so
for creative professionals if you want
to do color accurate work the Aero
fifteen really is the only laptop I've
tested that actually comes close to
providing that experience directly out
of the box it's time to talk about the
stuff that you guys I'm sure I'm most
interested in the performance so inside
this laptop as I mentioned earlier core
i7 7700 HQ quad core CPU as well as the
geforce gtx 1066 gigabyte GPU you might
have unit 16 gigabytes of ram and a 512
gigabyte SSD but if you open up the
laptop you will find that it is just a
single channel configuration there's a
spare dim slot available if you just
simply slide in another dim and go
straight up to 32 gigabytes with no
worries and there's also a free em not
to slot allowing you to easily expand on
the storage pretty easily although 512
gigabytes out of the box is still
reasonably decent one thing you won't
find here no 2.5 inch drive base slot
but again the free em no 2 spot should
be enough for most people who want to
upgrade the storage in the future and
it's reasonably accessible simply by
removing the base cover anyway let's
dive into some benchmark graphs and
we'll start off as always with pc mark
we'll take a look at the home workload
and the gigabyte arrow 15 here performs
around the same mark as a lot of other
i7 7700 HQ devices and this is largely
the same in their creative workload
posting a very reasonable score here for
something with the gtx 1060 inside of
lers don't want to use this device as a
workstation the pc mark work test
reveals another very soild score for the
area of 15 moving on to our encoding
benchmarks and as this device is
targeted towards creatives encoding
videos and so forth might be
you want to do on the area of 15 and at
Cinebench are eleven point five squares
very solid on both the multi-threaded
and the single threaded test no
performance concerns here and again the
7700 HQ falls among the range of other
laptops with this CPU that we've tested
in the past in our x264 encoding
benchmark another fantastic solid
results from the i7 7700 HQ it blows out
any alterable completely head over water
so if you're after doing stuff like
video editing you'll definitely want to
upgrade to the quad-core 7700 HD that a
laptop like this provides in the winrar
compression benchmark this laptop does
suffer from having just a single channel
memory implementation so it's a little
bit slower than other laptops with a
7700 HQ inside they're still a solid
showing nonetheless and you see similar
results in MATLAB which can be a bit
memory bandwidth limited as well so for
those who are engineers yeah sorting in
extra deem into that device give you 30
gigabytes of RAM and also improve memory
bandwidth might improve your overall
experience here solid-state performance
was outstanding the 512 gigabyte SSD and
my device was a samsung s m96 one PCIe
nvme Drive so I see sequential read and
write speeds above 1.5 gigabytes per
second not quite as good in the random
results but still very solid and falls
among the range of other gaming laptops
that I've reviewed moving on to 3d mark
we just want to see how the gtx 1060
performs up against a range of other
devices make sure it's working perfectly
here any times by benchmark there's no
surprises here with the gtx 1060
performs as expected it's around 30%
slower than the gtx 1070 if you wanted
to spend more money and get a laptop
with that GPU inside but it is around
45% faster than the last generation gtx
970m and GPU limited workloads so there
is definitely a reason to upgrade from
those older generation laptops to
something with the gtx 1060 inside
revealer to Gambia we'll first start
with some of the older titles in Tomb
Raider ultimate preset 55 frames per
second average with a 1% low of 41 FPS
puts it in the same range of other gtx
1060 laptops in Metro last light very
high preset a
seventy-six FPS average is a very solid
result with a 1% low of 53 FPS in this
situation in BioShock Infinite another
game that runs really well on the GTX
1060 just over 100 FPS at 102 fps and
we're seeing a 1% low of 49 fps pretty
typical for this laptop in this game
Middle Earth shadow of Mordor 87 FPS
average here at maximum quality settings
with a 1% low of 62 FPS so in this older
title you'll be getting a fantastic
experience on the era of 15 in Grand
Theft Auto 5 we're seeing a average
frame rate of 57 FPS at maximum quality
settings with a 1% low of 40 fps
you might want to drop the things a
little bit to achieve a higher 1% low
but nevertheless this laptop does run
Grand Theft Auto 5 very well in rising
the Tomb Raider which is the most
intensive benchmark in our suite here a
29 FPS average is below 30 fps so it's
not delivering a fairly playable
experience by any stretch you'll want to
drop the settings down here to the high
level which delivers around a 63 FPS
average with a 44 fps 1% while making it
very playable in Deus Ex mankind divided
we're seeing an average frame rate of 39
FPS with a 1% low of 32 fps so not the
best experience here on aqua settings so
in order to drop it down to the high
quality settings those frame rates are
boosted significantly but if you're keen
on 30 FPS gaming you know the are two
types 1060 isn't too bad here and again
the GTX 1060 inside the area 15 is
well-suited to 1080p very high to ultra
quality setting gaming across a range of
games especially for those that want to
be targeting around the 50 to 60 FPS
mark you will need to drop the quality
settings from some times but the r15
provides a very solid gaming experience
nonetheless in quite portable form
factor I also wanted to talk about the
cooling solution because gigabyte has
done a really good job of keeping the
Aero 15 cool and quiet under operation
to be clear it's not silent I mean the
fans do spin up and you can hear them
but I've definitely heard louder gtx
1060
laptops the razor blade being one
example of a laptop that's slim and
portable but very larger in operation
the Aero 15 is nowhere near as loud and
our unsymmetrical err in i-264 systems
stability tests the cpu sonnet just 86
degrees Celsius while the GPU is at 75
degrees Celsius which is very cool for a
GTX 1060 laptop with this hardware
inside and when you get into a gaming
session the CPU temperatures drop even
further to around 78 degrees Celsius so
a really fine result from the cooling
inside the area 15 and a testament to
gigabytes high quality cooling solution
engineering cases laptop cool and
reasonably quiet viewing gaming that's
what you want to see in terms of battery
life there's an enormous 94 what our
battery inside this laptop I expected to
pull a little bit better than it did
considering how large the batteries but
it still manages to obliterate some of
the other Finan like GTX 1060 laptops on
the market like the msi gs70 form quite
as long as the razor blade does with
similar hardware inside but still
nonetheless a flawed result the force
towards the lower end of ultrabooks in
terms of a comparison there I think most
people will be satisfied with the
battery life of this is laptop provides
off the charge it's not nearly as bad as
some other gaming laptops on the market
at the end of the day the Aero 15 is
genuinely one of the best gaming laptops
on the market at the moment it has a
fantastic design with those slim bezels
around the sides and the display itself
is XY Pantone certified which means it
is color accurate out of the box the
hardware info is fantastic I 770 700 HQ
and the GTX 1066 8 gigabyte are well
suited to gaming at 1080p around ultra
quality settings at 60fps and of course
if you're a creative professional this
laptop is very well suited to rendering
videos and doing all those sorts of
things so you'd expect from a quad-core
CPU also seeing decent battery life from
the 94 watt hour cell and some upgrade
ability with the free m dot 2 slot and a
freedom slot inside this laptop the
keyboard very solid very quickie and
with full RGB backlighting and eland
trackpad surprised me a lot in terms of
how not awful it is so gigabyte has
really hit the nail on the head with the
error 15 and it is by far the best
that they produced so far in terms of
pricing the arrow 15 is priced around
the same as the razor blade so in the US
that's 1900 US Dollars and in Australia
$2,900 reduce however at that price you
do get a 512 gig SSD compared to 256 gig
in the razor blade I really think you
need 512 gig to you know actually be
able to restore more than just a few
games and in the razor blade that will
cost you a few hundred dollars more so
the area 15 is pretty much a cheaper
alternative to the razor blade and it
packs largely the same sort of quality
it's portable it packs fantastic
hardware decent battery life and you
know that X right Pantone certified
display blew me away out of the box it's
a really solid device from gigabyte and
one that I can highly recommend anyway
that's it for this review of the era of
15 I really hope and I have to send it
back anytime soon it's a fantastic
device and I do want to spend a bit more
time with in anyway you can check out
