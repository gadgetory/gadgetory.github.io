we're finally comparing the gaming
performance of aim DS Verizon 7 and
Intel's Core i7 coffee-like CPUs
although we've done this in the past
we're still yet to carry out extensive
gaming benchmarks using the GTX 1080 TI
previously all testing was done with the
RX Vega 64 graphics card not only that
but all previous comparisons are also
made before the meltdown and Spectre
security flaws were discovered as it
stands we're still the thick of it with
these security issues for those of you
unaware a team of security analysts
employed by Google tasked with finding a
zero-day vulnerabilities found three CPU
related security risks last year the
team is known as project zero and the
vulnerabilities that they discovered are
now commonly referred to as spectrum
meltdown variant 3 which is technically
known as rogue data cache load is now
commonly referred to as meltdown and
this variant only impacts Intel
processors and I wasn't mitigated via
Windows Update AMD believes that its
processors are not susceptible to this
variant due to the way their CPUs are
designed and therefore no mitigation is
required
that said the windows update is still
being applied to AMD systems and the
same performance hits suffered when
testing the Intel systems can be seen
thankfully though the meltdown patch had
little - basically no impact on gaming
performance though it does degrade
storage performance just a little bit
the real problem for both AMD and Intel
is the spectra vulnerabilities variant
one being bounced check bypass and
variant to branch target injection
starting with AMD they believe anyone
can be contained with an operating
system update and see Microsoft's
working on rolling those updates right
now variant 2 is also an issue for AMD
processors AMD has stated they believe
their CPU architectures make it
difficult to exploit variant 2 but
they'll continue to work closely with
the industry on this threat they go on
to say that optional microcode updates
will be available to their customers and
partners for Eisen and epic processors
starting this week so that was actually
meant to commence last week as it stands
AMD nor their board partners can give me
any information
these updates from what I can tell
nothing's actually in the works for be
350 and X 370 boards at the moment but
no one's really telling me anything so I
have no additional information on the
situation so right now for eyes and
users you can update using the latest
Windows patch but there will likely be
more updates to come as for Intel it
seems to be a much messier situation
meltdown has been mitigated by the
Windows Update but spectra still remains
a big problem
all the major partners have now issued
BIOS updates intended to mitigate
variant to branch target injection we
tested this a few weeks ago now and
found that for the most part games were
only around three to five percent slower
while storage performance took a massive
nosedive since then countless users and
media outlets have confirmed those
findings so we need to do more testing
to see what this ultimately means for
desktop users as for variant 1 which aim
they think they are mostly safe from
Intel is yet to address at all as I
understand it they are more vulnerable
than AMD is worse still apparently even
after erasing variant 2 with the BIOS
update that destroyed storage
performance it's reported that doesn't
actually solve the issue Google has
since come out and said they have a
solution for variant 2 that doesn't
impact performance their method uses
software patches rather than disabling
the affected CPU features according to
Google their patch codenamed
ret Pauline has a negligible impact on
performance particularly when compared
to Microsoft and Intel's fixes this is
obviously something Intel arts clients
will no doubt want to take advantage of
so we can probably expect to see more
updates in the not-too-distant future
okay so now that we've gotten all that
out of the way it's quite clear that
neither AMD or intolerant of the woods
yet and that performance we're seeing
today could likely change in the near
future what many of you or rather a
whole heap of you have been handing me
for over the last few weeks is a
comparison between Rison and eighth
generation core processors so today
we're comparing the Rison 7 1,800 x with
the core i7 8700 k and for this test the
focus is on stock out-of-the-box
performance the core i7 87 ROK processor
has been tested on the gigabyte z 370
horas gaming 7 motherboard using
version f 5l which includes the updated
CPU microcode intended to mitigate
variant 2 of Spectre meanwhile the risin
718 hundred x has been tested on the
asrock X 370 Taichi and so far ambi
hasn't issued any BIOS updates both the
AMD and Intel CPUs were tested using
ddr4 3200 CL 14 memory with the latest
version of Windows fully patched the
graphics card of choice this time is the
GeForce GTX 1080 I'm testing takes place
at both 1080p and 1440p using a range of
quality presets we have a number of
modern CPU demanding titles to look at
so let's get to it
first up we have Assassin's Creed
origins and here we see at 1080p using
the medium quality settings at the 87 RK
is 18% faster or 23% faster if you look
at the 1% low data the margin closes up
as we increase the quality settings once
we hit ultra the 87 RK is just 13%
faster that's still a decent margin but
with both CPUs maintaining over 50 FPS
at all times the experience was much the
same using either CPU of course 1080 T
Ione is a more likely to game at 1440p
and here the 87 or ok was just 6% faster
on average though it was 11% faster for
the 1% low result obviously the reason
why the margin closed from 23% down to
11% for the 1% low result is because as
we increase the quality settings the GPU
continued to limit the performance
further moving on to ashes of the
singularity we find a similar story
using the medium quality settings the 87
RK was as much as 22 percent faster but
that margin was more than half at the
same resolution using the maximum visual
quality settings then at 1440p the 87 RK
was just 6 percent faster testing with
battlefield 1 provides some interesting
results regardless of resolution and
quality settings when paired with the
gtx 1080i the Rison 7 processor allowed
for a 1% result of between 100 and 110
fps in fact we only saw an 8% variance
meanwhile the variance for the Intel CPU
was as much as 38% and while it was at
least 20% faster at an EP it was 2%
slower at 1440p
that said at 1440p the 87 ROK was still
8 percent faster when comparing the
average frame rate right so next up we
have Call of Duty World War 2 in this
title unfortunately
doesn't play that nicely with Verizon
CPUs of course the resulting performance
is still excellent as we saw well over a
hundred FPS at all times
even at 1440p however here the 87 arcade
was still at least 17 percent faster
it's obviously a pretty significant
margin
moving on to Dawn of War 3 we find the
rise in 7 1800 X is good for around
seven years 72 FPS for the minimum at
109 FPS for the average this meant the
87 RK was up to 20% faster but by the
time we reached the 1440p resolution
that margin was reduced to just 10%
debut 6 mankind Nevada was testing using
the DirectX 11 API because we're using a
GTX 292 I hear the 87 ROK was up to 33%
fast using the medium quality settings
and then 19% faster with the ultra
quality settings though it was just 9%
faster for the 1% low result oddly
moving to 1440p allowed the Rison 7 CPU
to hit the lead beating the 800 K by a
slim margin dirt 4 is one of the few
recently released triple-a titles that
was designed with rise and CPUs in mind
although the 1800 X gets stomped using
the medium quality settings at 1080p
using the ultra quality settings brings
rise and back into play then at 1440p we
again see slightly stronger 1% lower
results from the AMD processor here we
have another racing game f1 2017 and
this time we find things mostly going in
favor of the Blue Man Group the 87
arcade was after 22% faster though with
the ultra quality things that margin was
reduced to 10% for the average frame
rate but 16% for the 1% low then at
1440p we see very similar performance
though the 87 era case still offered a
better minimum result the project cars
franchise has never been a friend to AMD
and we see that here with the 87 ROK
which was around 30% faster throughout
the 1080p testing thanks to a GPU
bottleneck things closed up at 40 and 40
P and here the Intel CPU was just 5%
faster when testing with rainbow
succeeds we see that the 87 era K was up
to 23% faster though it was just 12%
faster when using the ultra quality
settings at 1080p then once we at 1440p
the margin is reduced to 2% while the
1,800 X provided a better 1% low result
based on a 3 run average Star Wars
Battlefront 2 is the most
recently-released game I've tested with
them while there will be those that
complain about it being included because
of the loop box controversy and all that
it's still a good quality game that's
very well made and for now you can't
actually pay to win so I figure we
should probably just hold fire anyway as
I said the game's very well made and we
see that it does a great job of
utilizing Rison when compared to many of
the games looked at already here the 87k
is at most just 14% faster and that's
pretty impressive when you consider that
was clocked at least 13% higher in this
test so that is a really good result for
AMD once we jump to 1440p the 87 or okay
is still 10% faster but as I said given
the difference in clock speed that's
really not a bad margin finally the last
game we're going to look at is total war
Warhammer 2 and here we find some very
competitive results indeed although the
1800 X was around 4% slower for the
medium and high quality tests it was 6%
faster for the ultra quality test and
14% faster once we hit 1440p so again
another title where the rise in CPU
manages to come out on top at 1440p okay
so before I summarize all the data we
just went through let's quickly look
back at the numbers found previously
when testing with Vegas 64 liquid here
we have the low resolution 720p results
using the ultra type quality settings
and here the 87 okay was on average 19%
faster than the 1800 X or 21% if we look
at the 1% low results those margins were
reduced to 7% at 1080p 10% for the 1%
low result and again this is with the
ultra type quality settings enabled then
finally at 1440p the 87 RK was only 3%
faster when comparing the average frame
rate I happen to think the testing done
previously with Vegas 64 is actually
quite interesting and gave a different
perspective to the usual you know
testing done with an NVIDIA GPU for
example the behavior is quite different
when testing games using DirectX 12 with
a radeon GPU and this does often play
more into the hands of horizon still I
got pretty slammed by quite a few people
for testing with Vegas 64 liquid
claiming that my results were misleading
and that I should have tested
exclusively with the GTX 10 atti I'd
always plan to revisit these tests with
the 1080i and I made note of that in the
original video but given the Vega
benchmarks included 720p results I
wasn't quite sure what all the fuss was
about
anyway I've now done the 1080i testing
we've looked at that so let's go over
all the data or again and summarize that
quickly and see what the picture looks
like now here's a full breakdown
providing the average results across the
dozen games tested using the medium
quality settings the 87 okay was seen to
be 21% fast in the 18 hundreds when
comparing the one percent low data even
I was a bit surprised when I realized
that this is the exact figure we saw
we're comparing these CPUs with Vegas 64
at 720p what would you know I'll just
wipe away that smug look and move on the
electoral quality results at 1080p
showed the 87 Academy 15% files for an
average and 13% for the 1% lower result
for the average framerate this is a bit
different to what we saw with the slower
Vegas 64 graphics card but at 1080p
that's not entirely surprising and the
1% lower margins were actually very
similar previously with Vega we saw a
10% margin then finally at 1440p the
8700 a was 5% faster on average and 2%
for the 1% low result previously when
testing with Vega 64 we found the 87
okay it was 3% faster on average and 2%
for the 1% low result so again very
similar findings this time around of
course this time we do also have the
meltdown spectral patches applied and
this will be slowing the 87 arcade down
by 3 to 5% so I'm aware that this is
helping to reduce the margin right so
there you have it not a lot has changed
since we last did this kind of test for
a no compromise type gaming solution
just maximum frame rates best
performance you can possibly get the
8700 K is really the way to go simply
the best option available right now but
if you plan to play at 1440p or at
possibly an even higher resolution or
use a lower end graphics card the
difference between the 87 RK in AMD 6
and 8 core eyes and CP is going to be
negligible for productivity type work it
really depends on the application but we
found mostly that when comparing the
CPUs and they're out of the box formats
to say before in your overclocking takes
place the 1,800 X is generally faster
with both CP
you ever clocked that means the 1800
exit for you hurts and then the 8700 K
at five gigahertz they are quite similar
in most heavy workloads price-wise the
1800 X is about $20 cheaper but most
smart shoppers will probably pick up the
r7 1700 for just $290 and then just
overclock it to somewhere between 3.8
and 4 gigahertz and that price the eight
core eyes and CPU is really an awesome
Buy
so if you can wait till April I'd
certainly do so because at that point we
will have these second-generation rise
in parts and we'll get to see what they
bring to the table along with the 400
series chipsets getting back to the
testing this video I didn't cover
overclocking but it honestly doesn't
really make that much difference the
1800 X is only a few percent faster on
overclocked and then the 87 are okay
well that does see a nice boost we're
not GPU limited but of course for the
most part you will find yourself GPU
limited with ultra type settings and
therefore you will see a little to no
improvement even at 1080p in fact I've
already shown hundreds of benchmark runs
on the channel using these very games
with the 8700 K clocked it between 4.8
and 5.2 gigahertz you can expect about a
7% boost at 1080p using the medium
quality settings with just a one to two
percent boost at an EP and 1440p using
the ultra quality settings so for those
of you who are going to beat your chest
claiming at the 8700 K has to be
overclocked and when it is it will just
devastate the rise in CPU well that's
certainly not true when using ultra
quality settings with the GT X 1080 Ti
anyway that's gonna do it for this one
not a lot has changed but honestly we
weren't really expecting it to Intel
remains the king for performance while
AMD still provides the most bang for
your buck I hope you guys enjoyed the
