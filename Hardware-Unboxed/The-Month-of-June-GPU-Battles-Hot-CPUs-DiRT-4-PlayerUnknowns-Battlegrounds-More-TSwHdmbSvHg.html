month we produced 23 videos in total
covering a wide range of products and
topics and this year is the recap are we
quickly touching on each and every video
adding any notes that I might have while
taking a look at a few comments along
the way so let's get right into it shall
we
starting off the month we were halfway
through Computex 2017 and on the first
of June we covered MSI's upcoming gtx
980ti
lightning z a beastly looking graphics
card with all the limits removed
i've been keen to check this thing out
ever since i first laid hands on it and
the good news is i should have one in
hand very soon for an in-depth review
following that video I checked out some
very powerful msi damming laptops there
are some impressive gaming focused
laptops coming out of msi at the moment
so that one is well worth checking out
also worth checking out our deep cools
upcoming open air fans the
strange-looking UFO type designers
certainly very eye-catching and to my
surprise this is one of the more popular
videos to come out of our Computex
coverage I also learned that Gibby ace
always likes his own comments and tech
reviews wasn't that impressed with our
lack of booth babes in the coverage and
then finally lost my finger said this I
roll my eyes every time he says acrylic
its tempered glass hmm is it
is it really moving on I found my
favorite PC case to use to this year's
competing Strayed show and that was the
new cooler master master case H 500 P
the new 1/2 model this stunning-looking
case is surprisingly affordable at $140
u.s. and packs a para front-mounted 200
millimeter fans behind a unique looking
acrylic window based on the comments
that followed you guys look to have
agree with me so I won't be the only one
trying to buy one of these on release
day it seems rounding out our Computex
coverage I checked out some new and
existing MSI pre-built desktop pcs aimed
at gamers and then headed over to the
Aero cool booth where I hung out and
relaxed in the new project 7 gaming
chair with my buddy Brian over from tech
yesterday after that Tim took over as I
flew back from Taiwan and delivered us a
review on the Corsair glaive RGB mouse
in short Tim liked the mouse felt that
the quality was there but wasn't totally
sold on the price which was a bit rich
for his liking Tim bought me a little
more time to get some work done with his
movie length review on the samsung
galaxy s 8 plus in my opinion Tim
covered everything and then some but he
insists he had a little bit more he
would have liked to include in the video
but realized it was getting quite long
as it was so included all that extra
stuff in there written version over at
Tech spot anyway it was mighty long as
it was and if you are thinking of
getting an SI then be sure to grab a
nice beverage as snack and check out
Tim's mega in-depth review then it was
my turn to produce some content and I
decided to do what many of you have been
requesting for a long time now and that
is to revisit the GTX 780 this was
another lengthy video and I invested a
huge amount of time making it but in the
end I think it was worth it and those of
you who watched it seem to really enjoy
it I was a bit cheeky in the comment
section predicting what the top three
comments would be and for a while there
I was on the money
I think the ordering is shuffled around
a bit now anyway but it was still a lot
of fun next up we had another review
from Tim covering the Moto G 5 and G 5
plus some decent budget smartphones the
review wasn't terribly popular we're
still sort of diversifying here at
however unboxed a lot of you guys seemed
you just want GPU and CPU reviews and
nothing else but Tim did an excellent
job as always
and this
all serve as a good reference for those
things you're buying either model
unfortunately this point of the month I
was a few days in a suffering from a
horrible flu virus thing that I caught
on my way back from Taiwan so that was a
lot of fun very low on energy at the
time I struggled to get much done but I
did spit out a few videos on a couple of
games one of which was dirt for the
first video I did with dirt four was
what does it take to play episode and
once again we were looking for 60fps at
1080p for how we're of choice to achieve
this performance was the pentium g 45 60
and Radeon rx 570 and the comments
section was mixed with opinions on the
game's visual quality we went from damn
I thought this was real life to they're
no better than dirt rally in my opinion
they are better than the previous
installment but not mind-blowing anyway
I wasn't done with do it for a few days
later I delivered an extensive benchmark
video covering 27 GPUs at three
resolutions you lot seemed to enjoy
those videos and I loved the two to
three day grind testing a wide range of
hardware that's not sarcasm either I
actually do enjoy it that said I did
feel like absolute rubbish at the time
thanks for that flew but the positive
feedback you guys always leave help me
soldier on so big thanks for that a few
days after the big dirt for benchmark I
was still sick but thankfully recovering
so I decided to take the time to test a
few different hardware configurations in
player unknowns battlegrounds and create
another what does it take to play
episode don't normally do two of these
within the one week but when you're sick
there's nothing better to do than play
games the game itself look like it would
be a lot of fun with friends it's not
particularly exciting single-player or
solo I should say that said though this
isn't really my style a game more into
the real-time strategy stuff but still
yeah looks like it could be fun though
there was a lot of camping going on but
I guess that's the easiest way to
survive till the end
moving on back to full fighting strength
at this point I decided to check out the
new gigabyte or SRX 580 XJ graphics card
and what a beauty it was I've had this
thing on hand for a while I used for my
rx 580 versus 1060 comparison so I
thought it was time for an official
review admittedly though the timing
wasn't great as buying an RX 580 right
now is next to impossible thanks to a
theory in mining or
just cryptocurrency mining in general
now and as such pretty much the entire
comment section was full of you is
complaining about availability how
overpriced the rx5 80s are right now and
well I can't really blame them Tim let
back into action with another smartphone
review looking at the mi6 and affordable
flagship smartphone Tim was impressed
with the performance display battery
life and zoom camera he wasn't overly
impressed with the slippery designer
thick bells and lack of a headphone jack
that was certainly a big no-no then next
up it was time for a 31 minute long
unboxing bosses episode with yours truly
it had been about a month since the last
episode and those of you who really
enjoy this series we're getting a bit
Restless based on what I was seeing in
my inbox
hopefully the weight was worth it though
and thankfully I did have a heap of
interesting stuff so quite a few
products to check out in that one the
SteelSeries arcticus headsets were a
pleasant surprise
as was gigabytes RX 560 graphics card
when my youngest daughter Tesla made a
quick appearance in the video as she
modelled the SteelSeries headsets for me
after receiving that gigabyte rx 560
graphics card I knew it was time to
settle in for a long benchmark session
and compare it head-to-head with the GTX
1050 and 1050 Ti while I was doing that
at at least one I wasn't running
benchmark passes that is I was
researching and putting together another
top 5 best video looking at the gtx 1070
graphics cards I had a lot more fun than
I expected with that one and it must
have shown because the video was really
well received so much so that I'm going
to make that a regular series then it
was time for the main course the epic rx
560 vs. gtx 1050 showdown in total i
through 30 games of these GPUs in an
effort to determine which one is best
for you as expected the results were
mixed
AMD winning some well in video 1 some
others if you're in the market for a
brand new GPU and we have around $100 to
spend I recommend checking that
comparison out there are also some funny
comments in that video as well cliff was
concerned with my well-being after
testing so many games nice guy cliff
Vladimir hates miners for an hour also
thinks I'm going mad and need to take
some time off he suggests Megalodon
hunting I'll have to Google a few
charters see what I can find
putting the prehistoric fishing trip on
hold I decided to check out something
that's no doubt considerably more
expensive Intel's new corex
lineup although it was a bit late to the
party I ended up getting my hands on the
core i9 1700 X I 778 20x and i7 and 7800
X still not 100% sure how I feel about
the 6 core and 8 core models yet a bit
more testing will have to be done this
month and of course we are still waiting
for NBS thread Ripper but yeah for now
the general consensus is that the core X
platform is expensive hot power-hungry
confusing and we're still yet to see the
most extreme parts which are even more
expensive and no doubt hotter and
hungrier as I tried to cool off after
testing the core X series Tim took over
for an unboxing boxes episode and watch
the entire thing like a complete amateur
you'd think it was his first time ever
hosting the series wait it was well then
I guess we can cut him a bit of slack
and overall I think it was still a very
enjoyable episode so check it out if you
haven't already then he summed it up
pretty well this was an unboxing unboxed
boxes episode and indeed it was while
Tim was making our more lighthearted
content look difficult
I was tackling a truly difficult task
keeping intel's new 10 core core I 9 7
100x cool when overclocked in the end it
took a custom liquid cooled cooler to
get the job done we managed a stable 4.7
gigahertz overclock with low temps
around 70 degrees
not bad for what it is but also by no
means practical either we receive plenty
of comments on that video well over 600
in fact Nick weighed in to note how much
better the hardware unbox videos look
now when compared to earlier this year I
have to credit Tim with helping out
there a few tweaks to my existing so
that went a long way most of the
comments were bashing Intel's new
external on platform and it was hard to
argue with most of them so I didn't
there were also some nice comments
complimenting our work and a few
negative ones as well
I liked this comment from obvious
longtime viewer Navin your reviews are
vague and not in-depth I don't think
your videos are good enough for a person
to decide whether to purchase anything
less on the fancy stuff and up more the
depth of the product review well Navin
thank you
I'll certainly keep that in mind for
future videos I did point out the fact
that that particular video wasn't a
review but whatever then capping off a
busy month we looked at in Syria mining
in the form of a benchmark video of
course I wasn't particularly motivated
or excited to do this one but with so
many of the regular hub viewers
requesting it I felt I'd better make it
happen that said though I have to admit
for the most part the feedback was a bit
disappointing on this one I mean I
expect that not every video is going to
please everyone but hope though is that
if a product or topic doesn't interest a
certain person that just skip it I mean
we do create multiple videos per week so
skipping one shouldn't be a big deal and
almost all of them do take a serious
amount of time and effort to create also
I have to admit I personally wasn't that
interested in cryptocurrency mining and
I'd probably rather it didn't exist the
benchmark results though did interest me
and it was interesting to see how the
various GPUs compared in this unusual
workload anyway that brings us to the
end of June and what happened last month
and we look set for yet another busy
month and I can't wait to see what new
hardware we discover along the way oh
yeah we also hit 100,000 subscribers
last month as well that's probably worth
mentioning coming up I have a couple of
really big benchmark videos planned and
some of them should be a bit different
from the usual head-to-head stuff so be
sure to keep an eye out for those gems
also got some really exciting stuff
planned as well so it's going to be
another great month here at harbor
unboxed that's going to do it for this
one if you like this video then please
take a moment to help sentient the like
button subscribe if you haven't already
and make sure you hit that little
notification be able to put yourself in
contention to make that all-important
first comment I'm your host Steve see
you again soon guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
