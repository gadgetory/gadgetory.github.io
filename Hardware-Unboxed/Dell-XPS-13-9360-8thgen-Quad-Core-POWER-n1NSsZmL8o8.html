unbox bit of a change of scenery here
I've just moved house in my new set
isn't quite ready for you so win my
office too now and we're gonna be taking
a look at the brand new Dell XPS 13 you
might not be able to tell from the
outside but this version of the XPS 13
is actually upgraded compared to the
model that launched towards the end of
last year only in one single way though
and that's the move to new Intel eighth
generation KB like our processors even
though this is just a simple CPU swap
it's a pretty big upgrade for the XPS 13
considering the performance difference
between the dual core cabinet processors
used previously and these new quad core
parts we're saying now some testing I
did for tech spot a few months ago
showed performance gains near 50% but of
course we'll explore that more later in
the video to start with I wanted to
discuss the design of the XPS 13 which
has changed very little in the nearly
three years since the first Broadwell
model launched we have seen some minor
additions over time like the inclusion
of a fingerprint sensor for Windows
hello and the USB C port but the basic
design with its ultra slim bezels has
remained pretty much the same I have
seen some reviews floating around that
suggests the design of the XPS 13 is a
bit stale and needs to be updated to
remain relevant up against other modern
ultra portables why do agree the design
is a bit stale actually don't think it
needs to be updated when the XPS 13
first launched in early 2015 the design
was quite far ahead of its competitors
delivering a massive display in a
smaller than normal chassis a couple of
years later and the XPS 13 design isn't
the standout it once was
thanks to other OEMs you know lifting
the head game but it's still pretty good
and hold its own against the competition
in fact we're still not at the point
where all other laptops are maximizing
the screen real estate and minimizing
bezels though you know we are I guess
slowly getting there if you haven't seen
an XPS 13 before the build uses
aluminium on the lid and underside Plus
soft touch carbon-fiber around
keyboard and trackpad the two-tone
design looks fantastic and it feels
great to hold when shut thanks to the
matte metal finish the keyboard Paris
does accumulate fingerprints rather
easily though it feels great when typing
devil isn't super concerned with making
the slimmest all lightest laptop which
is why the XPS 13 sits up to 15
millimeters thick and 1.3 kilograms for
the touchscreen model this is a good
choice anyway as allows them to cram in
a large 60 watt hour battery and keep
the overall footprint small the Xpress
13 is still one of the smallest 13-inch
notebooks you can buy the slim bezel
experience with the XPS 13 it's still
great though you will have to put up
with the less than ideal webcam
placement you also have to choose
between the 1080p non-touch and qhd+
touchscreen display options which is the
same as early models the high resolution
display comes with a battery life hit
though obviously it's a fair bit sharper
and the keyboard and trackpad remain
unchanged both of which offer a decent
experience some of the modifier keys are
a little smaller than other keyboards
though this doesn't hurt usability too
much and the feel to each key is fairly
average these days for a laptop the
track that is excellent though and you
won't have any problems using it guess
what the i/o it's also unchanged in a
surprise to no one two USB 3.0 ports on
either side Thunderbolt 3 port with just
2 PCIe lanes and a 3.5 ml headphone jack
and an SD card slot unfortunately the
XPS 13 still charges using a proprietary
connector rather than USB see rather see
an additional USB C port add to the
device for charging which could double
as handy connectivity when not being
used for charging now my review unit
came with the 13.3 1080p IPS LCD which
is the base option available I prefer
this over the qhd+ model even though the
higher res model comes with a
touchscreen
mostly because 1080p is perfectly fine
for a 13.3 inch display and you can eke
out extra battery life at a lower
resolution
brightness from this display is
excellent exceeding 415 it's at peak
when viewing an all-white screen viewing
angles are also very good and use
a matte finish rather than gloss helps
to reduce reflections and improve
visibility however while the display
does look pretty good from a casual
standpoint it's not the best for
creative professionals that demand color
accuracy the XPS 13 implements dynamic
contrast which adjusts brightness and
other parameters on the fly in an
attempt to improve the experience as far
as I can tell it's impossible to disable
this setting and that leads to poor
color performance as a result the XPS 13
display is poor from a color calibration
standpoint the display is tinted blue
with an average temperature around 70
100 K and grayscale performance is weak
but it gets worse when looking at
saturation in color checker results
which pushed past a Delta II average of
8.0 this is very inaccurate and
unsuitable for those who want to create
images or other things accurately with
that said it is hard to accurately
measure the performance of a display
that dynamically adjusts as the
composition of an image can affect how
each individual color is displayed for
my test i measured its steady-state
color performance with solid colors
though in practice performance could be
better or it could be worse who who
really knows with dynamic contrast let's
move on to talk about the big change in
the Dell XPS 13 the upgrade from seventh
gen to 8th gen u series processors from
Intel
unlike previous generations which only
brought minor improvements over their
predecessors Intel's 8th gen parts
managed to grow from 2 cores and 4
threads to 4 cores and 8 threads in the
same 15 watt TDP and was a relatively
similar power consumption Intel's even
managed to increase peak clock speeds
with 8th gen parts looking at the core
i7 8550 you compared to the core i7 7500
u single and dual-core turbo speeds jump
to 4.0 gigahertz from 3.5 gigahertz
while the 8550 you can hit 3.7 gigahertz
on all four cores however base clocks do
drop from 2.7 to 1.8 gigahertz and
during sustained workloads and all cores
you'll see lower clock speeds on 8th gen
starting with a look at shorter
workloads which are what most people do
on an ultraportable the core i7 8550 you
in my Dell
PS 13 review unit stuck sup well in some
cases like the Excel Monte Carlo
workload the 8th gen cabe you like our
part is twice as fast as the last gen KB
like CPUs other times like in MATLAB
gains are a more modest of 30% though
that's still pretty impressive and you
can also see strong improvements in PC
mark which feature a collection of short
and longer workloads however there are
some interesting things to note here the
Dell XPS 13 does not always reach the
same levels of performance as the
inspire on 13 7021 and I've long product
name but I did look at that laptop a
couple of months ago and the Express 13
Falls up to 23% behind in some cases
like WinRAR this appears to be due to a
combination of less time at maximum
boosts clocks and around 15% less memory
bandwidth and some of these benchmarks
are fairly memory heavy the good news is
that the XPS 13 compensates for this
through excellent sustained performance
in 3d rendering workloads like Cinebench
and video rendering like x264 encoding
the XPS 13 was as much as 17 percent
faster than the inspire on 13 7000 which
uses the exact same cpu the I 78550 you
also holds a commanding lead against the
last gen 7500 you in Cinebench
multi-threaded it's 82% faster while you
also get single threaded gains of 16%
thanks to those higher clock speeds the
KB like our CPU is also capable of
rendering x264 video around 62% faster
which is an enormous gain in a mobile
form factor graphics performance has
also improved though it's not by nearly
as much as CPU performance in the
heaviest graphics workloads cable a car
sees gains in the 5 to 10% range though
in more CPU demanding games or less
intensive titles the CPU performance
does improve things a bit more than that
for storage the XPS 13 uses a samsung PM
961 SSD at least in my review 'not with
the 256 gig drive this is a fairly
common drive for high and ultra
portables like this so it's performance
isn't surprising excellent sequential
reads and writes that exceed one
gigabyte per second with very solid
round performance
well it's not going to blow you away
considering its popularity amongst the
Ultra portables but it is very fast for
everyday usage it's also worth
mentioning battery life because this is
one of the outstanding aspects of the
XPS 13 that's 60 what our cell manages
to us an incredibly long time for an
ultra portable topping the charts in
most situations so you definitely won't
be disappointed with the Batchelor life
especially consider you get that extra
boost to performance thanks to the 8th
gen parts so the refreshed XPS 13 won't
blow you away with new features or a
revamp design but it does improve in one
critical area and that's the performance
the inclusion of new hg n intel kami
like our processors does see an enormous
gain on its predecessors producing
performance up to twice as fast as the
an equivalent seventh gen CPU and it
gets better if you're jumping from say
an original Broadwell XPS 13 with
performance more than 2.4 times greater
at times pricing for the XPS 13 remains
the same as last year though at the
moment only some XPS 13 models come with
the 8th gen cpus if you're after the
base $800 model all the thousand dollar
model you'll be looking at 7th gen part
so I'd avoid those for now the variant I
review costs 1149 which is OK for a core
i7 8 gig of ram and a 256 gig SSD but
it's not the cheapest out there and
Aussies can expect to pay around 1,800
dollars for this model when it becomes
available there right now you can grab a
core i5 equivalent for $1,600 which is a
pretty reasonable price considering the
design still holds up well and the XPS
13 is one of the most portable 13-inch
devices on the market I'd still
recommend it for those wanting a pure
laptop if you want a 360 degree hinge or
other fancy features though the familiar
design of the XPS 13 won't be for you
that's the beauty of having so many
great choices on the market these days
anyway that's it for this review of the
new Dell XPS 13 there's links in the
description below if you're interested
in checking out the current prices of
this laptop through Amazon and be back
very soon
to finally take a look at those rising
mobile ap use that many of you guys have
been asking
ambi has finally hooked me up there so
check back soon on the channel for that
until then I'll catch you next time
