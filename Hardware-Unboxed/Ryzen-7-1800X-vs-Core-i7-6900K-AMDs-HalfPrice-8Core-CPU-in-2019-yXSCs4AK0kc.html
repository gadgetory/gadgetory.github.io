we're revisiting the battle between the
horizon 7 1800 x and the core i7 6900 k
and this this is a bit of a special
battle so let me explain why
prior to the risin 7 Series launching in
March of 2017 if you wanted a modern 8
core desktop processor you had one
choice and that was the core i7 69
hundred K today's video is sponsored by
Corsair and their void Pro RGB and HS 70
wireless gaming headsets both offer an
exceptional audio experience using
specially tuned 50 millimeter neodymium
speaker drivers and the premium build
quality means they're not just highly
durable but also very comfortable both
offer a 16 hour runtime with a slew of
other features so for more information
please check them out via the link in
the video description the 6900 K was a
Broadwell ebay cpu supporting 8 cores 16
threads and was clocked at a frequency
of 3.2 ki go to the base but Atwood
clock as high as 3.7 gigahertz for the
boost it packed what was at the time a
very fat 20 megabyte l3 cache it also
supported quad channel ddr4 2500 memory
40 pcie 3.0 lanes and it was rated at
140 watts for the TDP so essentially it
was a beast the only problem with this
beast was that cost one thousand and
ninety dollars us and that was a pretty
big jump up from the already overpriced
340 WS quad core Core i7 7700 K but with
no alternatives to speak of Intel were
free to set pricing as they saw fit so
charge an arm and a leg they did however
roughly a year later people were finally
liberated by Amy's risin 7 series 8
cores for half the price or even better
if you look at the 1700 X and 1700 well
I suppose that's close enough to the
truth yes the 1800 X offered 8 cores and
half the price of the 1600 K but it
wasn't exactly a direct competitor the
6100 K is a member of Intel's high-end
desktop
Foreman as such offers significantly
more PCI Express Lanes when compared to
mainstream offerings so if you want to
hang multiple workstation class GPUs off
your CPU some high-speed storage and any
other bandwidth hungry devices you might
need a high-end desktop CPU will be
required and the horizon 7 series really
wasn't an option for such users as it
packs just 16 PCIe lanes and they're
required by the discreet graphics card
nevertheless the Rison 7 Series what's
still hugely exciting as not everyone
requires a workstation class CPU 8 core
processors are still extremely
beneficial for mainstream users gamers
and even content creators back in 2017
it was mostly just streamers that found
the 8 core desktop CPU useful for gaming
but today modern games are starting to
put them to use and this is pushing
streamers towards 12 and even 16 core
parts the point is though before Rison
those of you who could benefit from 8
cores had to make do with 4 unless you
took out a small loan to grab something
like the core i7 1600 k processors like
the 1800 x really have helped bridge the
gap between mainstream and high-end
desktop Intel CPUs moreover it's those
who didn't require the extra PCIe lanes
who saw the 1800 X as a direct
competitor to the 6900 K and it's easy
to see why once we get benchmarking I
should note that AMD did later blow
Intel's high-end desktop processor range
out of the water
well that's subjective but I believe
they did and I did so in late 2017 with
thread Ripper and perhaps that's a
battle that we can revisit at a later
date for now let's focus on the Rison 7
1800 X and the core i7 6 900k though I
have also thrown in the 7700 K results
from last week all CPUs were tested with
G skills flair X ddr4 3200 cell 14
memory the 7700 K and 1800 X used to a
gigabyte modules while the 1600 K gets 4
as this is required to take advantage of
its quad channel memory controller then
as usual the GPU of choice is the
GeForce r-tx 2080 Ti
ok let's get into the benchmarks kick
starting the benchmarks we have
Cinebench our 20s multi-core test and
here the core i7 600 K is 6% slower than
the 1800 X out of the box
once both CPUs are overclocked the 1600
K did jump into the lead and now it's 5%
faster than the 1800 X with a score of
4039 points then as we have a look at
the single core performance it's
interesting at the 1800 x wins out of
the box but it does have a higher clock
speed the 1600 K is limited to 3.7
gigahertz for its turbo single core
clock speed as a result it was 9% slower
in this test that said once overclocked
it was able to beat the 1800 X this time
by a 6% margin next that we have WinRAR
now for the upcoming is n2 content I
would like to just make it clear that I
will be including both winrar and 7-zip
in the benchmarks I know these days
7-zip is widely regarded as the superior
application but for this video we only
have WinRAR so it is what it is and this
application does favour memory bout a
latency over well pretty much everything
else for that reason the 6000 okay and
it's quad channel memory configuration
just cleans up but this is still
interesting to look at because as you
can see for memory sensitive workloads
the 6000k really does enjoy a massive
advantage over the 1,800 X however for
video editing tasks the 1800s and 600 K
are much more evenly matched in fact out
of the box the 1800 X was 8 percent
faster taking just 508 seconds to
complete the workload that said once
both CPUs r overclocked the 1800 X
became 5 percent slower not a big
difference either way and it's fair to
say for encoding performance they are
very similar
moving on to v-ray and here we see out
of the box performance is virtually
identical between the 618 hundred X that
said the higher overclocking ceiling of
the 600 K allowed it to pull ahead by a
13 percent margin so a strong result
here for the Intel CPU but overall the
much cheaper 1800 X was very impressive
we find a similar story of Corona here
the 1800 X was 5 percent faster out of
the box but once overclocked the 600 K
was 11% faster and it's the same story
with blender out of the box the 800 X
was 9% faster but once overclocked the
69 okay hit the lead by 5 percent margin
overall though these results do bode
well for AMD's much more affordable 1800
X when it comes to total system power
can see
the six-hour okay is more efficient out
of the box as AMD had to be a bit too
aggressive with the 1800 ex pushing it
well out of its efficiency window or at
least the efficiency window of the
manufacturing process however once
overclocked the 1600 K did gobble up
slightly more power there overall both
CPUs did consume roughly the same amount
of power here okay time for some gaming
benchmarks and first that we have
Assassin's Creed Odyssey and here the 60
hour ok shows the 1800 X who is boss
stock the 600 K just about maxes out the
RT X xx atti delivering almost 20% more
frames than the 1800 X though I should
note that the frame time performance was
just 10% higher overclocked the 1800s
does fare a bit better it's fight
against the 69 hundred K but even so the
high end desktop processor was still 12%
faster on average as you'd expect the
margins close up even more the GPU
limited 1440p resolution and once the
cpus are overclocked there's really very
little in it moving on to battlefield 5
and here we see a little to no
difference between the 1% low
performance of the 1600 K and 1800 X yet
despite that the 1600 K was around 12%
fast when looking at the average frame
rate moving to 1440p basically
neutralizes the results in here the 1800
X and 600 K push the RT X 20 atti 2 very
similar frame rates ok so I know these
results look a bit too favorable for the
1600 K but I can assure you they're
accurate
in fact the 1600 K is very similar to
the 99 or okay in this title even out of
the box the 600 K was almost 20% fast in
the 1800 X but once you have a clock
both CPUs that margin is extended to
almost 40% in fact the 69 RK was 51
percent faster when comparing the one
percent low performance and that's
pretty insane those margins are
significantly reduced dark 1440p as we
become more GPU bound but even so once I
overclocked the 1% low performance of
the 69 UK was still 27% higher
moving on to the division 2 here the
1800 x + 69 ok much more evenly matched
though again it's the overclocked
performance that gets to the 69 RK ahead
in these closer battles and we say that
once again increasing the resolution the
margins previously seen are basically
eliminated and now the 69 arcane 1800 X
deliver the same performance as we found
in the past fire cries not a good title
for Rison processors and despite the 6
and I are ok losing to the 77 ok it's
still well ahead of the 1800 X
especially at once overclocked even at
1440p the 1600 K remains well ahead of
the 1800 X and we see that the
overclocked results are well they're
quite brutal really World War Z isn't a
very CPU demanding game but even so the
600 K was clearly faster than the 1800 X
here but because we're talking about
well over 130 FPS at all times the
margins here really aren't a big deal
as you'd expect there's also very little
difference in 1440p but again the 1800 X
does trail the 69 ok by a small margin
rage 2 also isn't a particularly CPU
demanding title therefore even at 1080p
with an RT X 2082 a we see very little
difference between the tested CPUs and
that being the case of 1080p
we see a very similar thing at 1440p the
hitman 2 results are quite interesting
stock the 69er okay managed to match the
77 ok making it 18 percent faster than
the 1800 X however once overclocked that
margins blown out to almost 30 percent
as the 1600 K lays waste to the 1,800 X
and also beats the 77 ok by a handy
margin even at 1440p Intel's high-end
desktop 8-core processor remained well
ahead of the 1800 X particularly once
both processes were overclocked
the horizon 7 processor performance very
well in total war Three Kingdoms
matching the 69 henrique out of the box
and it was only slightly slower for the
one percent low performance once both
CPUs were overclocked that being the
case there was simply no separating the
two at the more GPU limited 1440p
resolution so a good result here for the
rising 7 processor and I think that'll
just about do it for the benchmarks
right so there you have it
unsurprisingly the core i7 6000k is
still a beast in 2019
basically if AK o'clock a bit higher it
would essentially be a beefy core I
$9.99 hundred K and they both use
Intel's low latency ring bus
architecture and this is why I much
prefer the 69 arcade to the newer core
i7 9800 X I mean yeah the 9800 X is much
cheaper but obviously times
changed the 9800 ex was released in late
2018 whereas the 69 hundred K was
released in mid 2016 whenever we revisit
older processes like this I'm constantly
reminded of how much of a shame it is
that Intel has to continually acts
platform support though I suppose having
said that as good as the 6800 case still
is at the current second hand asking
price which is typically about $400 u.s.
they're not particularly great value
when you can snap up a thread gripper a
1950 X second hand for about the same
amount then of course if you don't
require all those extra PCIe lanes
something like the 1800 X for under $200
is really hard to pass up especially
when it can be thrown on a modern and
still well supported platform so
grabbing an 1800 extra around $150 u.s.
it's not really a challenge and with the
3800 acts about to hit shelves and say
it's going to be even easier to find
cheap 1800 X processors still looking
back at the situation in 2016 you can
easily see why AMD priced the 1800 X at
$500
they really well they realistically
couldn't have charged any more and I
think they knew that which is why there
was a $400 version of the same product
called the 1700 X don't get me wrong I'm
not trying to take anything away from
the first gen rising 7 Series it was
phenomenally good but it was good
because it was priced appropriately back
in 2016 the first gen Rising series
found itself in a bit of an awkward spot
it wasn't FIRREA to the 77 RK at the
time when it came to gaming performance
but could hang in there and even beat
the 6 na hurich a for a lot of
productivity workloads but then it
lacked the features to compete as a
high-end desktop part moreover most
games and applications were flat-out
utilizing a quad core processor at the
time let alone an 8 core 16 thread
processor today though with software and
game requirements what they are I feel
as though AMD probably could have gotten
away with a $500 rise in seven part with
no cheaper alternatives to speak of but
in 2016 that simply wasn't going to fly
anyway I think it's fair to say in 2019
the 1,800 X is still largely inferior to
the 600 K in terms of performance
but it is still less than half the price
in fact it's a little better than half
the price so again for those who don't
need the extra PCIe lanes the 1800 X is
clearly the better buy and then I'd
argue if you do need the PCIe lanes then
the 1950 X would be the better by
wrapping this video up there is one more
thing I should talk about and that is
broad belly overclocking it has been
quite some time since I broke out my
Broadwell II test rig so yeah I have
done plenty of overclocking with it in
the past but I haven't done anything
recently so for this video I just
referred to my previous notes on how I
overclocked my 1600 K chip and how I got
it happily to 4.3 gigahertz with 1.3
volts so I jumped into the BIOS I tuned
the necessary settings and then I booted
it into Windows and initially it seemed
like good news the system booted
straight in the windows it was
completely stable and I got testing
however right away I knew there was
something a bit off because the cinnamon
are 2000 results while they were
improved
they weren't improved by to the to the
degree that I would have expected them
to be improved by let's say that after a
little snooping around I noticed the CPU
was only boosting to 3.7 gigahertz so it
was kind of like an MC overclock I
thought that was a bit odd so I reset
and I jumped back into the BIOS all the
settings were correct as far as I could
tell I did a little bit of tinkering
booted back into Windows and I was faced
with the same issue a 3.7 gigahertz cap
I messed around for a lot longer than I
care to admit trying to solve this issue
before giving up and referring to Google
for some help it wasn't long before I
found thread after thread of Broadway
Leona's complaining about the same issue
and it turns out in late 2018 Microsoft
released a Windows 10 update that broke
Broadwell Lea overclocking however you
can't just blame Microsoft or Windows on
this one rather it was a joint effort
between Microsoft to Intel when I'm
dressing the spectra variant to
vulnerability this window is update
along with an Intel micro code update
disables bars overclocking and there's
really no way around it unless you
remove the update and roll back to an
earlier biased revision what I was
forced to do for this video was applied
the overclock in the BIOS and then once
that was done loading two windows open
up the Intel XTU software and then
apply the overclock that would then see
the overclock stick in Windows and I
could test the CPU at four point three
gigahertz the problem with this method
is you have to open the XTU software and
then manually reapply the overclock
every single time so it's hardly a
practical solution I took to Twitter to
check if anyone and come up with a
better solution and no one had the best
solution came from Twitter user just
plain L who suggested base clock
overclocking and that does work so he
uses a 125 megahertz clock and this gets
he's 68 52 4.2 gigahertz which is one
hundred fifty megahertz down from the
previous 4.4 gigahertz he was hitting
using the multiplier method so he wasn't
happy about this but he noted it's
better than nothing I can certainly
understand why he's mad imagine spending
six hundred and twenty ish dollars us on
an unlocked six core 12 for a high-end
desktop processor only to have the
unlocked functionality basically
disabled a few years later and a few
years later when you really need it the
most
you'd think the down greater performance
seen when addressing these various
vulnerabilities was enough but it seems
broad well the owners have to contend
with the overclocking Headroom taking a
hit as well and I suppose all that
miserable note I'm gonna end that video
