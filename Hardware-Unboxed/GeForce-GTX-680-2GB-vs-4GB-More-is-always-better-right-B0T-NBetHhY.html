we're digging into the fun topic of VRAM
capacity that's it this video isn't
going to be an in-depth look at a wide
range of graphics cards with varying
vram capacities instead for this one
we're going to be looking at the two
gigabyte and four gigabyte versions of
the geforce gtx 680 so why am i doing a
VRAM capacity comparison with a six year
old graphics card because I can recently
I got my hands on the 4 gigabyte GTX 680
I've had the 2 gigabyte model since it
was released and while I was able to
borrow a full gigabyte model for testing
6 years ago back then I didn't really
learn much other than the fact that at
the time it was just a huge waste of
money because games didn't require that
much of a ram even at 1600 P today
though games can often and do consume
more than 2 gigabytes of vram at 1080p
and we looked at this last year an hour
how much RAM do gamers need video the
question is though how much if any
impact does this have on frame rate
performance and other any other
drawbacks to having 2 gigabytes of vram
opposed to 4 gigabytes or more in our
recent gtx 680 revisit using the more
common 2 gigabyte version i was often
told the results were misleading and if
i had used a 4 gigabyte version of the
gtx 680 it would have been much faster
in today's games then shortly after that
video i revisited the r9 280x and i
included just the 4 gigabyte version of
the gtx 680 to see if anyone noticed as
it turns out it seems only the AMD fans
noticed and they screamed biased as i
was misrepresenting the gtx 680 by using
the 4 gigabyte version which is
naturally much faster this isn't new
either the hottest talking point of my
2016 video can the gtx 1050 to
outperform 2012 $500 flagship gtx 680
wasn't the fact that the gtx 680 was
handicapped by the 2 gigabyte memory
buffer and in a win for sure if it had 4
gigabytes like the gtx 1050 TI anyway
let's not worry about that and move on
to the results I have some graphs for
you guys followed by some side-by-side
gameplay footage which reveals something
very interesting but we'll get
that in a moment for now let's check out
the graphs first up we have the dawn of
war three results and as you can see the
four gigabyte model is no faster than
the two gigabyte version delivering the
exact same result
I should note I did attempt to clock
both models at the same frequency but
the two gigabyte model would often clock
itself about two percent higher so keep
that in mind as we continue to go over
their results the dirt fall performance
was also much the same though the two
gigabyte model did come out slightly
ahead but with less than a two percent
difference that's certainly within our
margin of error especially given the
possible clock speed difference Ghost
Recon wildlands still exceeds the two
gigabyte usage even with these low
quality settings but despite that the
four gigabyte model appeared no faster
then we have Mass Effect Andromeda and
here we see performance again is much
the same with either model battlefield
one is one of the few games i've tested
maxed out and even here the four
gigabyte model is only slightly faster
the average can certainly be chalked up
to the margin of error and that 5%
increase for the one percent low is
probably genuine though the difference
really could be as small as two percent
the two gigabyte version was
consistently faster and prey and two FPS
might not be that much here but there is
a little more to this story and I will
look at that in a moment finally
rounding out the graphs is Resident Evil
7 and again there's just nothing to see
here folks
formats wise there's no difference
between the two you buy and four
gigabyte versions of the gtx 680 even in
modern titles ok so now it's time to
check out some side-by-side gameplay
footage and we'll start with battlefield
one here you can see despite using the
ultra quality settings we're only just
exceeding two gigabytes of vram and
therefore the two gigabyte gtx 680 is
able to hang in there rendering the
textures without an issue although the
minimum frame rate did drop down more
for the two gigabyte model in this pass
keep in mind this is just a single run
and over an average of three runs they
were much more similar moving on we have
Star Wars Battlefront - oddly here the
full gigabyte model actually consumed
more system memory than the two gigabyte
version so that was a little unexpected
that said we have seen examples in the
past we're giving more memory just makes
things a little more memory hungry
the game was tested at 1080p using the
higher quality settings and as you can
see the game does allocate more than
erm performance though was basically
identical using either two gigabyte or
full gigabyte version of the GTX 680
next up we have project cars - and this
toilet was tested using the ultra
quality settings and this meant the game
allocated up to 2.7 gigabytes of vram
and this time we do see the 2 gigabyte
model consuming roughly 1 gigabyte more
of system memory still in our test
system performance was much the same
using either model now we have some rise
of the Tomb Raider action and for this
one we were forced down to the medium
quality settings for playable
performance however I have jacked the
textures up to the higher quality
setting to increase the VRAM usage under
these conditions up to 2.9 gigabytes of
vram was allocated for the 4 gigabyte
model and this meant VRAM usage was
considerably higher with the 2 gigabyte
model that said overall performance was
much the same with just 2 frames in it
and that's nowhere near enough to be
noticeable Assassin's Creed origins was
also tested using the medium quality
preset with the textures manually set to
high this saw verum usage peak 2.5
gigabytes though like star wars
battlefront 2 we find that RAM usage was
actually lower with the 2 gigabyte card
so again a very curious result last up
we have prey and this is the most
interesting title this game was tested
using the higher quality preset and VRAM
usage did peak at 3.1 gigabytes but if
you recall the 2 gigabyte model was
faster in our previous prey benchmark if
you haven't already noticed the reason
for this seems to be the fact that the 2
gigabyte model simply isn't even
attempting to render most of the
textures is it better look at the issue
I noted this was happening in our GTX
680 revisit a few weeks ago I said the
game was very playable and quite smooth
in fact but it just looks horrible with
most of the textures missing and now you
can see what I mean so when it comes to
benchmark numbers for the most part the
vram capacity has little impact on
performance and this is also true not
just for benchmarks but for when playing
for hours upon hours unless you have a
very limited amount of system memory or
the memory using is very slow then
chances are spotting the difference is
going to be very unlikely now as you've
just seen visual quality can be
significantly impacted depending on the
game praise the only title I came across
where the 2 gigabyte GTX 680
wasn't
noticeably worse but they'll no doubt be
other titles as well of course it was
still playable it just looked pretty
ordinary tweaking the quality settings
to better balance the load might help
but really you will be more limited with
what you can do with the 2 gigabyte
model basically what all this means is
if you can get your hands on a 4
gigabyte version of the GTX 680 or any
other graphics card for that matter then
it's worth doing if you're not paying an
exuberant price premium over the 2
gigabyte model looking at budget
graphics cards like the rx 550 you can
at times get the 4 gigabyte version for
just $10 more and I would suggest you do
so sometimes though you will be faced
with a $4 premium and that's where
things get a bit iffy in my opinion for
the most part you won't see a 40% return
on investment especially if you're
playing less demanding titles such as
overwatch and fortnight for example so
keep that in mind anyway I hope this
video helps clear up some misconceptions
about vram capacity more is certainly
desirable but it doesn't always mean
better performance so be careful how
much you spend to nab that extra GDR
