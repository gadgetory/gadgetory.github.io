video I'm checking out what it takes to
play prey at 1080p and for some reason
I'm standing up guys I'm just trying it
out anyway for those of you unaware prey
is an action-adventure game developed by
Arkane studios and it was released
earlier this month it's built upon the
crying's and so as you would expect the
graphics are pretty spiffy
anyway hex if you had been asking me
very nicely I might add to benchmark the
game with the new graphics card such as
the rx 580 or gtx 1060 while i will be
adding prey to my massive list of games
they already benchmark with I thought
why not check out what kind of new
hardware you need to enjoy the title in
orbits Gloria the games been receiving
very positive reviews from not just
critics but also gamers themselves so
that's always nice to see right now on
Steam have a 90% of all user reviews are
positive and again that's nice to see
and it's quite a rare thing these days
as a result prey is quickly rising up
through the ranks of the most played
games on Steam overtaking the likes of
total war Warhammer left 4 dead 2 and
The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt for example so
if you're in the market for a new PC
what do you need to play pray let's go
find out
Calvino probably has a keycard you can
locate him for what's left of him with
the security roster
vital signs critical

I think that's the director of the lab
hmm I have the sense he resented you
unfortunate
processors synchronizing I
that side of the lab was breached hard
vacuum no gravity there's an exterior
airlock in the machine shop you could
use to reach him you'll have to upgrade
your suit with a propulsion system first
Vital Signs
the gtx 750ti looks to be the sweet spot
for those wanting to play at the 1080p
resolution using the very high quality
preset $440 u.s. or $210 Australian the
1052 eye allows for a minimum 60fps for
the most part and it averaged around 7
fps in our test given this is a single
player title so not super competitive
I feel 60 frames per second will be
ample still if you would rather the FPS
counter spend more time hovering between
70 and 90 FPS than something like the rx
484 gigabyte might be a better choice
the rx 460 which we looked at last
appeared to be pretty poor value and
compared to the GTX 1050 Ti in this
saddle with the quality settings reduced
to the medium preset the rx 460 still
struggled to maintain 60 FPS though it
did stay about 50 FPS for the most part
so it was certainly still very playable
that said we do use the full gigabyte
model which only costs $10 less than the
1050 Ti so given the lesser performance
and the lower quality settings I'd pass
on the rx 460 for this title so for
playing prey at 1080p and all of its
glory I highly recommend the horizon 5
1400 coupled with the geforce gtx 750ti
as they look to deliver game as the best
bang for their buck when shopping for
new hardware of course if you are
serious about your gaming that I suggest
pulling out $50 more to secure the
horizon 5 1600 and if you can swing it
check out the GTX 1063 gigabyte or rx
570 actually I will have a massive
head-to-head comparison between those
two very GPU soon so keep an eye out for
that speaking of which I'd better get
back to benchmarking I'm your host Steve
see you again soon guys
