week-long break is now over I've had my
fun fishing it's time to get back into
work and what better way to do it than
tackle a 33 game benchmark and I'll be
doing so featuring the new gtx 60 and 60
i promise you guys that I would do a
comprehensive benchmark with the new
budget trend GPU so here we are but
before we get into that big benchmark I
would like to thank Corsair for
sponsoring our work and on hand we have
then you dominate up platinum RGB memory
this new ddr4 memory packs tightly
screened high frequency memory chips
providing speeds of up to 48 hundred
mega transfers per second and while high
frequencies big capacities and low
latency timings and what the Dominator
series is all about this new platinum
RGB memory also looks the part with a
dozen ultra bright individually
addressable RGB LEDs encased in a
high-quality aluminum heat spreader for
more information check them out via the
link in the video description now for
those of you who missed it our day one
review featured a dozen games many of
them were very recently released titles
when we found that in these newer games
the GTX 1660 came out looking pretty
great I don't expect this 33 game
benchmark will change too much but it
should serve as a decent buying guide
for those tossing up between say the GTX
1660 and perhaps the Radeon rx 580 maybe
even the 590 the fact that the new
GeForce GPU is around 30% faster and
Assassin's Creed Odyssey might not
matter that much if you predominantly
play titles such as Strange Brigade
battlefield 5 or Sniper Elite 4 for
example so to give you an idea of how
these two GPUs and many more comparing a
wide range of games we have a 33 game
benchmark the focus once again will be
on the more popular 1080p resolution but
I've also tested at 1440p as well and
will look at some of those results in a
moment also for those of you after the
results for all 33 games at 1440p then
please head over to our patreon page
where you can find all those graphs for
free the link will be in the video
description now before we get into the
results a few quick notes on the test
system the test tree includes a core I
nine ninety nine cake locked at five
gigahertz using thirty two gigabytes of
ddr4 3200 memory as for the drivers we
used adrenaline 2019 Edition at nineteen
point two point three for the radeon
gpus and game ready for 1935 whq l for
the geforce GPUs okay let's get into the
results kick starting off this benchmark
session we have the Division two brand
new title and this is the first time
we've actually benchmarked with this
game and rather than use the canned
benchmark I will be recording using
in-game performance though as Tim found
the in-game performance is very similar
to what you see in the built-in
benchmark anyway here we see at tally P
that the GTX 1660 is good for 68 FPS on
average using the ultra quality preset
that figure drops down to just 46 fps
and while playable you'll probably want
to do some tweaking here to improve the
frame rates and again Tim has a pretty
useful guide on exactly how to do just
that
anyway as it stands the 1660 was 15
percent faster than the GTX 1060 but
eight percent sold in the rx 590
assassin's creed Odyssey is a pretty bad
title for AMD and here we see the GTX
1660 basically matching Vega 64 so yeah
don't expect to see that too often this
also meant while it was just 12 percent
fast on the GTX 1066 ago but it was 28%
faster than the radiant rx 590 then at
the higher 1440p resolution we see a
slight shift in the results here the
1660 still maintained a reasonable lead
over the 1060 rx 590 and 580 but was now
seen slipping behind the Vega GPUs
though not by a significant margin it
has to be said next up we have strange
Brigade and here the GTX 1660 really
isn't that impressive in fact it's only
able to match the gtx 1066 EG but at an
EP making it quite a bit slower than the
Radeon competition much the same has
also sent at 1440p though here the 1660
is able to just edge out the six
gigabyte 1060 still though this meant it
was slower than the Radeon rx 570 so
obviously not a great result therefore
Nvidia
despite that though the gtex 1660 is
back on top for our Star Wars
Battlefront to test here at found itself
situated between the rx 590 and gtx 1070
so not a bad position for a $220 US
graphics card to find itself and with 85
FPS on average it kind of found itself
in a category of its own here then at
1440p we do find a similar situation
here the 1660 was 17% fast in the RX 590
and 22% faster than the six gigabyte gtx
1060 having said all that it was still
15% slower than the geforce gtx 1070
moving on to monster hunter world and
here we have the gtx 1660 basically
matching the RX 519 this matter a few
frames fast the gtx 1066 here bytes so
nothing too exciting here then and we
also see much the same story at 1440p
and they spent the gtx 1660 was 20%
slower than the TI version next up we
have warframe in here the gtx 1660
offered a small performance gain over
the gtx 1066 you might as well as the
Radeon RX 590 that said every GPU tested
was good for over 100 FPS on average so
the win here really isn't that much of a
big deal
things become a little more challenging
at 1440p but even so the 1660 was still
good for a 1% low result of 90 FPS on an
average frame rate of 109 FPS and all
this meant that it was just 9 percent
faster than the old Pascal based GTX
1060 so again not a terribly exciting
result here now f1 fans will enjoy what
the GTX 1660 has to offer at Tony Pete
was 11% fast and the similarly priced rx
590 an 18% fast in the oldest suit
gigabyte 1060 it was also just 16
percent slower than the geforce gtx 1070
and radeon RX vega 56 and as we've seen
time and time again much the same
while seen at 1440p though here it
manages to close the gap to the gtx 1070
while vega 56 gets a little further away
still overall performance was strong
with 61 FPS on average and finally the
last game that we're gonna discuss the
results for is the Witcher 3 and here
the 1660 was only able to match the rx
590 and some
presently was 3% slower than the old gtx
1066 gigabyte so i guess that means
we're ending on a very disappointing
result here for the new budget cheering
GPU and performance really wasn't much
better at 1440p either here the 1660
only matched the 1060 placing it roughly
on par with the Radeon rx 590 okay so
let's start to wrap all this testing up
here is the breakdown of all 33 games
tested so far
comparing the gtx 1660 and radiant rx
590 at 1080p again if you want to see
any of the graphs for these games at
either 1080p or 1440p you can just head
over to our patreon page they're all
provided there for free so yeah if
there's any particular games you want to
see a bit more information for you can
do so anyway getting back to this
comparison we see that overall the
GeForce GPU was on average 5% faster
that's down from an 8% win in our
original 12 game sample so while the
performance margin has shrunk a little
the Turing GPU still came out on top and
it did so by winning by five percent
margin or greater and 16 of the 33 games
tested meanwhile the RX 590 was faster
by a 5% margin or greater in just 5 of
the games so even though AMD has now
matched the price of the gtx 1660 with
their RX 590 they'll need to do better
than that for us to recommend the RX 590
over the gtx 1660 then when compared to
the gtx 1060 we said the margin is
dropped quite a bit previously the gtx
1660 was 21% faster for the 12 game
sample and that was featured in our day
1 coverage and now with 33 games it is
just 14% faster that's a pretty big
difference and I suspected the 1660
generally does much better in newer
titles older games such as The Witcher 3
World of Tanks project Cars 2 and so on
don't hand the cheering architecture
much of an advantage over Pascal finally
when compared head-to-head with the gtx
1660 t either vanilla 1660 was 15%
slower and that's very much in line with
our previous test which saw the non TI
model come in 13% slower of course at
times the margin did grow to 20% or more
and we saw this in half a dozen titles
all right time for a cost per frame
analysis and he will
at the typical asking prices for each
GPU the RX 580 has dropped down from
$200 us to just $190 us a few people
made a big deal out of this in our day
loan coverage coverage that I explained
was prepared a week in advance because I
was taking a holiday anyway truth is a
$10 price drop doesn't really change
much yes the rx 580 is slightly better
than the gtx 1660 in terms of value with
that $10 price drop but of course
there's not really that much in it
essentially this means you can save
around 10% on the cost of the graphics
card to have 10% of the performance
shaved off the rx 590 that has seen some
pretty hefty price cuts recently and
with numerous models now available for
just 220 dollars u.s. it's finally come
down to the price that it really should
have launched at giving it a little
slower than the 1660 but cost the same
amount it's obviously not quite as good
in terms of value truth be told the only
clear winner for AMD right now is the rx
570 but it's roughly 25% slot on the GTX
1660 so they aren't exactly in the same
performance category for that we'll
probably have to wait for the GTX 1650
meanwhile the RX 580 is gone from being
the best value sub $250 us option to a
rather tough sell now of course it's
best to look at performance in the games
you'll actually be playing if you
primarily play dirt 4 in battlefield 5
for example then the rx 580 of 590 is
the better choice that said as we just
saw there are far more games where the
GTX 1660 gets the better of the Radeon
GPUs now if you're on the fence and
regards to individual game performance
either because the performance is mixed
across the games you intend on playing
or you're planning on keeping the
graphics card for two to three years and
you really have no idea how things will
look even just six to 12 months down the
track what else can you look at to help
you make this purchase power consumption
is worth keeping in mind and not because
we're worried about the power bill but
because a more efficient graphics card
is a quieter graphics card and it's also
more friendly to the other components
that it shares your case with as it's
not dumping as much heat on them the GTX
16 60 pushed our test systems
consumption to just 262 watts
that's a 12 percent saving compared to
the
five seventy and almost a 30% saving
when compared to the rx five eighty and
five ninety it's also worth noting that
if we were looking at power consumption
for just the graphics card those margins
would increase quite significantly
so the Turing GPU is really are much
better in this regard for me personally
I think the almost 100 watt saving would
be enough to steer me in the direction
of the GTX 1660 so despite a few small
changes in pricing for the array young
competition not much has changed really
since our original review it was
published about a week ago now the
biggest changes really have come from
the sheer volume of games that were
tested in this video and the GTX 1660s
lead over the RX 590 for example that
has shrunk a little bit while the RX 5
90s price has also shrunk a little as
well so those two are much more evenly
matched now but I feel for the radio and
GPU to be the obvious choice it really
needs to be priced closer to $200 u.s.
it was pretty shocking to see the GTX
1662 lead over the GTX 1066 gigabyte I
shrivel up quite a bit previously it was
21% faster and in this video we found it
to be just 14% faster when using 33
games and that said I did note in the
day one review that depending on the
title used for testing the margins
between the GPUs could vary quite
significantly in the end the 1660 really
isn't an upgrade option for 1060 owners
anyway it was never intended to be so
yeah not a big deal there it's probably
more of an upgrade option for those of
you with something like a GTX 960
speaking of which I will compare the GTX
960 I'll do a bit of a revisit there and
I'll compare that to the 1660 so that
should be an interesting comparison that
you'll probably find on the channel next
week
for now though I think that is going to
do it for this one hopefully you guys
were satisfied by the volume of
benchmarks and graphs featured in this
video of course if you'd like a whole
lot more graphs there are 66 of them
over on our patreon page you can go view
all of those for free at your own
leisure and of course while you're there
if you'd like to support the channel
more directly you can do so Friz little
as $1 a month and that'll get you access
to some some pretty cool perks that we
do a monthly livestream and then for a
few more bucks you can get access to our
discord chat
all the tears are there you guys can
read that and if it interests you well
