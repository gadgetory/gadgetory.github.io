always surprises me how often we see a
request for crossfire and sli benchmarks
particularly given that we flat-out tell
you guys not to invest in either
technology we were doing that for years
now but there still seems to be a lot of
interest it's it perhaps even more
surprising given the fact that AMD and
in particular Nvidia have made no secret
about the fact that they are pulling
back on investment into multi GPU
technology I've been pretty stubborn
when it comes to multi-gpu benchmarks
and for at least a year now I've
basically refused to check out the
crossfire or SLI
but recently I did have two rx 590 cards
land at my feet and I thought why not
seems like there are enough of you that
want to see some update and testing and
well I've probably made you hold out
long enough now probably not long enough
for it to be any good I suspect but I've
made you wait long enough for the update
today's video sponsor is PCB way if
you're after a custom PCB for your next
project look no further they make high
quality PCBs at affordable prices right
now new members get a $5 bonus which
covers their first order of ten one to
two layer PCBs and they also offer an
assembly service furthermore right now
all PCB assembly orders enjoy free
shipping worldwide so check them out
link is in the video description last
time we visited in-depth crossfire
testing was back when Matt was still
hosting the channel and I was locked
away benchmarking and never to be seen
or at least that was the plan of time so
you can blame Matt for allowing my mug
on the channel anyway back in June of
2016 we grabbed two R X 480 graphics
cards threw them in our test rig and
enabled crossfire for the most part the
results were quite good but as we've
come to expect for a multi GPU
technology the experience was far from
flawless of the 23 games tested six
didn't work at all with crossfire
enabled and the problem here is for the
games that didn't work with crossfire
the RX for ID cards were on average 47%
slower from the GTX 1080 but just 9%
slower when working sorry for today's
test we have 20 much newer games and
we're going to see how well the two RX 5
90s compare to just a single card
in all 20 titles at 1080p and 1440p for
comparison we have nine other graphics
cards including high-end models such as
Vegas 64 and the r-tx 2070 I'll be
discussing the results for a dozen of
the titles tested with the rest of the
graphs available for free on our patreon
page and the link will be in the video
description for this benchmark I used my
core i7 87 okay GPU test rig which is
overclocked to 5 gigahertz and is
featured inside the Corsair crystal 570
X packing 16 gigabytes of ddr4 3400
memory then for the AMD driver we use
Radeon adrenaline 18 point 11.2 ok I
think that's about everything let's get
into the results first up we have
battlefield 5 and unfortunately we're
not seeing any support for crossfire in
this title so no extra performance from
the second card at 1080p and the same
was also true at 1440p that's really
quite surprising as crossfire did work
in battlefield 1 here we see a mold 33%
gain for the average frame rate at tele
P so not great but a big improvement
over nothing and scaling did improve at
1440p here the RX 5 nodes in crossfire
boost the performance by 46% again not
amazing but it is world's better than
what we're currently seeing in
battlefield 5 the best example of
crossfire scaling that I've come across
in this new batch of games was seen in
strange Brigade here the crossfire RX 5
nineties boosted the average frame rate
by almost 90 percent and better yet
frame time performance was still very
good
then at 1440p we see over 90% scaling
hitting 94% so this is an exceptional
result for the crossfire 5 90s
AMD's Radeon GPUs perform quite poorly
in Assassin's Creed Odyssey so
unsurprisingly crossfire support is not
existent in this title so whereas the 5
90s were faster than the RTR 2070 in
strange Brigade here they're 44% slower
moving on the hitman 2 and again another
time lacks crossfire support and
therefore running with the technology
enabled actually slightly reduces
performance this is also seen at 1440p
so we have another example of why multi
GPU technology really isn't a good
investment still it's not all bad and
another example of that is shut off the
Tomb Raider here we see a 48%
performance boost at 1080p and this
place the RX 5 90s alongside
GTX 1080 and Vega 64 furthermore scaling
is drastically improved at 1440p and now
we're seeing a 61 percent performance
boost and this place the 592 on par with
the r-tx 2070 so pretty solid result
they're mixed up we have Forza horizon 4
and this is another title where
crossfire isn't supported and therefore
we saw no gains at turn DP or 1440p in
fact we saw a slight performance
regression to my surprise monster hunter
world does support crossfire though the
frame time performance at 1080p was a
little sketchy whereas we see a 32%
boost for the average frame rate we only
see a 14% improvement for the frame time
performance jumping a 1440p does help to
iron out this issue but even so scaling
is below 40 percent which is pretty weak
and certainly doesn't justify the
investment of a second graphics card
here we have an example of a title looks
good when focusing on the average frame
rate but the experience was actually
pretty horrible
despite averaging 100 fps and Star Wars
Battlefront 2 at 1080p the average frame
time performance was pretty shocking
dropping down to well below the result
of a single 590 the game was basically
unplayable for example a constant 30 FPS
would provide a much nicer experience
unfortunately the frame time issue did
persist at 1440p I'm not sure if there
is a workaround for this title but out
of the box the performance is pretty
horrible using crossfire and you're
certainly much better off with a single
rx 590 frame time performance was also a
little sketchy and Deus Ex mankind
divided though nowhere near as bad as
what we just saw in Battlefront 2 the
issue was a little more noticeable at
1440p and although the average frame
rate is much improved with a second 590
the overall experience really wasn't and
due to the disparity between the average
and 1% low result when using crossfire
I'd rather play this title on a single
590 I also saw a little bit of
stuttering going on a far cry 5 and this
was present at both 1080p and 1440p
project cars 2 was another title where
we did see performance gains but the
frame time performance wasn't great and
much worse than that of a higher-end
single GPU graphics card now please note
all graphic card configurations with the
exception of the crossfire cards were
tested in Crysis 3 to measure power
consumption however crossfire isn't work
in crisis 3 so we used f1 2018 as this
was one of the better games for scaling
typically you're looking at a total
system increase of around 60% when using
a second rx 590 that leads to a pretty
brutal power consumption figure here the
crossfire 5 90s push total system
draught a 576 watts and I did observe
just over 600 watts in strange brigade
this is quite a bit more than even a
Vega 64 liquid graphics card and almost
twice that of a single RT X 2070 so
pretty horrible stuff when it comes to
power consumption okay so when compared
to a single 590 we saw a 37% boost on
average to the frame rate at 1440p
though that figure alone is a little bit
misleading frame time performance in
Star Wars Battlefront 2 and Davis X
mankind Nevada was very bad I'd much
rather use a single card in those titles
while stuttering was a bit of an issue
in Far Cry 5 project cars - and The
Witcher 3 normally I also test with dirt
4 but that title suffered serious
graphical glitches with crossfire
enabled so I had to drop it from the
batch of games that I tested with so are
you better off buying a higher end
single GPU graphics card or two cheaper
graphics cards well if you hadn't
already worked that one out here is your
answer the r-tx 2070 costs $500 us while
the RX 5 90s cost two hundred and eighty
dollars each and even if you compared
the r-tx GPU to a pair of $200 RX 5 80s
the outcome would be much the same get
the more expensive higher and graphics
card when everything's going to the
multi-gpu plan the RX 5 90s killed it
beating the our TX 2070 by a whopping
25% margin but out of the 20 games
tested we saw that kind of margin
exactly once next-best was 40% in f1
2018
9% and prey 5% in project cars but the
frame time performance was quite poor 4%
in Deus Ex mankind divided but again the
frame time performance was quite poor
and 3% in The Witcher 3 and again frame
time performance was suboptimal so in
true titles the crossfire 590 showed the
r-tx 2070 what for and in everything
else they got their PCI Express
connectors handed to them two years
later we find that once again
- GPU technology it seems like a good
idea on paper but in practice it is a
bit of a fail it's really only ever made
sense for those with money to burn for
example right now our TX 28 ECI SLO
graphics cards I'm about the only
multi-gpu configuration that makes sense
but in almost every way they make no
sense so I guess the point I'm trying to
make is that multi GPU technology you
really only make sense if you're at the
end of the road you've got the fastest
possible single GPU solution and yet you
can't get any more performance without
adding a second one so if you've got
money to burn on an RT X 2000 UCI and
you want another one
just because then I guess SLI is okay it
doesn't really make sense if you want to
use SLI for say RT X xx 80s in that case
I would just get a single RT X xx atti
as you'll receive smoother performance
in the vast majority of titles as for
the RX 5 90s in crossfire
well I'd much rather have a single Vega
64 graphics card for example that's
extremely rare that - five 9s will
provide higher frame rates than a single
Vega 64 card while also offering
smoother stutter free gaming if you're
only ever going to play games like f1
2018 that support crossfire really well
they're getting to say rx 570s for
example costing around three hundred
dollars would be a hard combo to beat in
fact and I think you can beat it but who
buys graphics cards to only ever play
one or maybe two games of course there
are other drawbacks that I'm yet to
discuss such as heat and power
consumption those two five 90s were
dumping so much heat into the corsair
crystal 570 x case and they spent more
money would need to be invested in case
fans and even then you're still running
hotter due to the way the cards are
stacked you'll also lose out on the
power supply the RT x 2070 system works
without an issue with a 500 watt unit
and 600 watts would be more than enough
the crossfire 5 90s though they'll need
an 800 watt unit 750 watts would be the
absolute minimum here and although we're
only talking about a twenty to thirty
dollar increase in PSU cost that's still
a factor that needs to be considered
ultimately though it is the poor support
that kills these multi-gpu setups and
that's why I feel no one should burden
themselves with SLI or crossfire
technology especially if they're trying
to gain higher end performance with
mid-range cards just by a faster single
GPU much less stressful anyway I think
