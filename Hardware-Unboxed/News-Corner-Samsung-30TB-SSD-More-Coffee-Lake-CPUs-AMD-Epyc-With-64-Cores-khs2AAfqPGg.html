of the news corner a weekly news wrap-up
show that we debuted last week to a ton
of positive feedback so big thanks for
the support from you guys out there I'm
back this week for another look at some
news and hopefully I can wrap this up
reasonably quickly does actually have to
catch a flight in about 12 hours time
anyway in this week's news corner we'll
be discussing
five Intel stories that's right Intel
has been quite busy this week along with
massive Samsung SSDs 64 core AMD CPU
rumors and a couple of game topics this
first topic is something that might make
a Star Wars and video game fans very
happy to hear there is a rumor floating
around right now that Disney and
Lucasfilm are set to ditch Electronic
Arts as the exclusive rights holder for
Star Wars games as apparently Disney
aren't happy with how EA has handled the
franchise I have absolutely no idea if
the story is even remotely true and a
Lynch words are being completely made up
but it's one of those stories you just
want to be true you know after the
battlefront to loot crate disaster and
EAS closure of visceral games who are
developing a single-player Star Wars
game there's not much more AE a could
have done to ruin Star Wars games to the
fans the original source report suggests
Lucasfilm are looking at Ubisoft and
Activision to take over the star wars
license though I'm not sure either of
those would be the best option
surely the ideal solution would be to
sparingly license the Star Wars brand to
any studio willing to make a quality
game so we can you know get a wide
variety of titles covering many genres
but yes room is probably not true but
you know at least we can all hope next
topic is about Samsung's new PM 164 3
SSD which is a completely unimaginative
name for what is a crazy Drive this
ludicrous SSD crams 30.7 2 terabytes of
storage into a 2.5 inch 15 millimeter
high drive with a SAS 12 gigabit per
second interface the SSD uses a
proprietary Samsung control along with a
ton of 512 gigabit 64 layer TLC vayne
inch
chips Samsung are stacking 16 of these
chips into one terabyte packages then
cramming 40 packages into the onedrive
giving a total capacity of 30 point 7 2
terabytes after over-provisioning
there's also a 40 gigabyte ddr4 sdram
cache and rated insurance of 56
petabytes over five years while not
targeting blazing fast speeds the PM 1 6
4 3 should be capable of 20 100 megabyte
per second sequential reads 1,700
megabyte per second sequential writes
400 K random reader ups and 50 K random
write AI ups enterprises can also
configure the power consumption between
9 and 13 point 5 Watts with lower power
drawer causing a hit to performance if
they choose that configuration this is a
very impressive storage device for data
centers and other enterprises you need
that high density high performance
storage it basically doubles Samsung's
last high capacity drive which topped
out at fifteen point three six terabytes
of course there is no word on pricing
for the 30 terabyte unit but we can
safely assume it will be thousands and
thousands of dollars
moving into the Intel news now late last
week into a briefly list of their
upcoming ten nanometer cannon Lake
processes in a micro code update
document Intel did remove the references
after people uncovered them however it
does reveal Intel has shipped these
processors to some customers ahead of an
expected launch later this year there's
not a ton of information in the document
but it does reveal at least two
configurations of a cannon Lake use Siri
CPU 2 + 2 in other words - CPU cores and
gt2 graphics and 2 + 0 which is 2 CPU
cores and no integrated graphics it's
also worth mentioning that you series
parts typically have a 15 watt TDP
designed for low-power notebooks so
these first 10 nanometer parts won't be
high performance by any stretch however
it is interesting that the first
references to 10 nanometer Cannon Lake
are for you serious parts of rather than
why series typically the first Intel
CPUs released in any new generation are
the 4 point 5 watt
Y series parts but so far we haven't
seen any active the Gen Y serious parts
it was expected
the first 10 animator Canon leg parts
would be these y series parts to round
out you know the 8th generation though
it is possible that plans might have
changed and instead we'll see cannon
lake for the first time as ninth gen
user excuse so it's something to keep an
eye out at least for the very least as
the progresses the second Intel story of
the day is really into Spector
everyone's favorite critical process of
comparability we all know that Intel
rushed and basically botched the initial
release of Spector patches earlier this
year causing reboots and other system
instabilities particularly on older CPU
architectures well a couple of days ago
Intel released what should hopefully be
stable microcode updates for all skylake
cable ache and coffee Lake processors
that address the specter variant 2
vulnerability you know the one about
stealing information through bad branch
prediction these new patches are only
for 6th gen processors and newer however
Intel's does say that they have a range
of beta patches in the work the Sandy
Bridge through to Broadwell which
they've distributed under NDA to some
hardware vendors again like with the
previous run of patches users will have
to pray their motherboard manufacturer
actually releases a new biased revision
that includes these updates last time
around it wasn't as common as we'd have
liked to see patches were much more
common for laptops and pre-built
desktops and we expect a similar
situation this time around new
coffee-like CPUs have started appearing
at some online retailers with pricing
giving us a good look at what to expect
in the coming weeks when Intel finally
releases them we did first hear about
this CPUs back in January through a
pricing leak with an Australian retailer
this is the first time we've seen the
u.s. pricing so starting from the bottom
end r2 Celeron processors with two cores
and two threads the $52 g40 962 or g-49
20 which differ in base clock speed by a
hundred megahertz then there are the
Pentium gold G 4500 G 5500 and G 5600
CPUs ranging from 3.7 to 3.9 gigahertz
on two cores and four threads with
prices at 70 183 and 93 dollars in the
core line will be seeing the core i3
8300 a 4-quart
or thread part a 3.7 gigahertz for 135
dollars basically this is just a hundred
megahertz clock speed jump over the
existing a380 100 for an extra $15 or so
and then in the core i5 bracket we'll
see two more six core 6/3 CPUs the i-5
8500 and I five 8600 turbo clocks are
unknown for these CPUs right now however
the i-5 8500 has a base clock of 3.0
gigahertz for $189 and the i-5 8600 has
a 3.1 gigahertz base for 208 dollars
these new core i5s build on the highly
popular Core i5 8400 with 200 to 300
megahertz clock speed increases and
better flesh out that range between the
8400 and the unlocked I 580 600 K
currently the i5 8400 is available for
$199 so the identically priced I 580 500
might be a great option once it's
released it is worth noting that these
aren't confirmed MSR peas it's just what
the various retailers involved with the
lake put out on their websites moving on
to the quicker topics of the week Intel
has announced they're working with top
laptop areum's Microsoft Dell HP and
Lenovo to bring a 5g connectivity to new
laptops in the second half of 2019 I'm
not an expert on 5g technologies by any
means hopefully I'll learn a bit more
and next week's Mobile World Congress
but it's safe to assume this will bring
high-speed connectivity devices that
really should include some form of
mobile networking these new laptops will
of course use a 5g modem from Intel and
they'll have a prototype on show at MWC
next week while it'll be nice to have
some 5g devices in 2019 like all mobile
network developments it'll be up to the
carriers to deploy adequate 5g
networking before these devices actually
become useful but you know it is a step
towards better connectivity for all
there were some stories earlier in the
week on what many assumed was a
prototype Intel discrete GPU as some of
you may recall Intel does want to get
into the discrete GPU market and they
hide AMD's roger Kaduri to help make
that a reality
however the diagram floating around that
looks like a potential discrete GPU
prototype is actually not
a discrete GPU at all instead as Intel
later confirm the circuit they presented
at the international solid-state
circuits conference is actually a test
platform for new power management
systems the test circuit does include an
integrated gen 9 GPU but it's not a
discrete GPU prototype and Intel says
this research is unrelated to their
future discrete graphics products from
the ever unreliable folks at WCC F Tech
AMD is apparently working on seven
nanometer epic service EPS that include
up to 64 cores and 128 threads on a
single package ambe's current epic line
is built on a 40 nanometer process and
tops out at 32 cores and 64 threads so
pretty significant jump there this new
epic line which is codenamed Rome will
reportedly come in to die configurations
12 cores per day with 4 dies per package
and 48 total calls along with 16 cores
per day and again 4 dies per package for
64 cores
apparently the lower 12 core per
diversion is not simply a binned version
of the 16 core variant but a different
design entirely like most WCC f tec
rumors let's take this one with a grain
of salt or perhaps a few trillion grains
a bit of pub G news to finish this one
off apparently the development team was
swamped trying to fend off hordes of
cheaters in recent months such that you
know new content was delayed but things
might be easing off now as they've
announced a few new updates coming to
the game the first deals with improved
matchmaking pub G will soon prioritize
matchmaking between players with lower
pings something that amazingly was not
actually implemented either now later
this year we'll be getting new content
that will bring a deeper and more
realistic gameplay experience whatever
that means
oh and new match will be unveiled in
March and hopefully will please players
more than the desert map that's it for
this week's news corner give us a like
if you enjoyed this segment probably
won't be back next week as both Steve
and I are away doing some cool stuff but
we're back the week after that so I'll
catch you then
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
