looking into how much RAM you need to
play the latest and greatest gaming
tiles released in 2018 now it is about
this time each year that I set up an a
memory capacity quest and last year's
expedition led me to conclude that for
gamers 4 gigabytes is out 8 gigabytes is
the bare minimum and 16 gigabytes of the
sweet spot while 32 gigabytes is
overkill that being the case for the
2018 version I will be dropping the full
gear beta configuration goes without
saying while they're getting rid of that
one now and we will be focusing on 8 16
and 32 gigabyte capacities but before we
get too far into this memory capacity
comparison today's video sponsor is Tim
group and their incredibly awesome
award-winning T Force Nighthawk RGB ddr4
memory originally available in either
black or white
they now offer the legend series
featuring a striking gold heat spreader
complete with the same trademark RGB
lighting they're available in 16 and 32
gigabyte kits supporting a range of
frequencies and timings so please check
the link in the video description for
more information now if you're after a
short and to the point answer this video
won't be for you we generally don't tell
our viewers what's what just expect them
to take our word for it and we try and
provide as many facts and fuze as we can
making it more of a learning experience
opposed to just hey do this or use this
also as the title suggests the emphasis
is on gaming for applications well it
really depends on the application there
are a lot of applications and even then
what you're doing with said application
a Premiere Pro for example using 4k
footage that likes lots of RAM I think
64 gigabytes plus so it's best to try
and research the requirements for the
particular application you intend on
using when it comes to games testing the
impact of memory or RAM capacity is no
easy task and there are many factors at
play here as I did last year before we
get into the results I just like to
quickly discuss a few of the challenges
faced when testing system memory
capacity so challenge number one is
picking the right Hardware the graphics
card you use can influence how much
memory you'll need for smooth gameplay
and in worst case scenarios the speed of
your storage can also impact performance
for example last year I found the GTX
1063 gigabyte would often result in
higher system memory usage when compared
to the six gigabyte model and this is
because at times you'll run out of erm
forcing the operating system to tap into
system memory then if you run at a
system memory some game s that's a move
to local storage and at this point the
performance it will be so significant
the game will almost certainly become
unplayable so basically what this means
is testing with an Archie x20 a TTI for
example and it's 11 gigabyte vram buffer
along with a super snappy nvme SSD
probably isn't the best way to determine
how much system memory your average
gamer requires I'd also assume that if
you have a $1000 plus graphics card
buying 16 gigabytes of RAM or more
really isn't an issue there's still more
factors to consider as well the quality
settings used can really have an impact
for example if you have a GTX 1063
gigabyte graphics card and you're happy
turning things down like textures to a
medium type quality setting then that
will reduce how much data is offloaded
to the system memory taking a list into
account i've tested a number of
different hardware configurations and
i'll be showing the impact this has on
performance in a moment during my
testing last year i discovered another
issue when trying to show the difference
between the various memory capacities so
typically our benchmark passes run for
60 seconds and then that run is done
multiple times usually we report an
average of three runs and this means the
system has a chance to cache the pass so
while the results from the first run
might see a shockingly low 0.1% or 1%
low frame time figure this can be
improved quite dramatically on the
second run and then again on the third
so giving you guys a three run average
can be quite misleading when talking
about the impact of various memory
capacities have on performance the best
solution I came up with at the time and
I haven't found a better solution yet a
year later was to run each benchmark
pass once then reset the entire system
load up the game and then run the next
pass and then I would do that three
times and then I would take the average
result there so I would have an average
of three runs but it would be an average
of all these first passes the benchmark
pass is actually 90 seconds in total but
I'm only
appalling performance for the last 60
seconds as the performance here more
accurately reflects what you'd see when
gaming is you're not always loading into
a game for the initial 5 to 10 seconds
at least to the game I can still be
loading in assets and this will cause
some issues with frame drops and things
like that and this is even present on
computers with sufficient system memory
typically the solution to this caching
problem is to just run the benchmark
pass once usually throw away that result
or at least average it against two or
three more runs and then you get a more
reasonable result there something that's
more true to what the system can do and
this is what we do when testing CPUs and
GPUs but as I said this method isn't
particularly useful when measuring the
impacts of memory capacity finally
benchmarks aside a good indicator for
working at how much memory you'll need
to play the latest games is just to
monitor memory allocation but of course
to do this you will need more memory
than the game actually require so it's
good to do this with sort of an overkill
amount of memory whether that's 32
gigabytes or whatever having said that
it's not foolproof but it does give us a
pretty good idea of how much system
memory a game requires to avoid any
slowdowns again the choice of Hardware
will also impact the amount of system
memory used so having said all that I'm
first going to show you memory
allocation and a few popular modern
titles of course released of this year
and all this gameplay testing was
conducted on our core I 999 wrote a test
system with 32-year bytes of ddr4
34-hundred memory and a geforce gtx 28
ETI graphics card the test system has a
number of applications running in the
background so it's not just some
completely fresh install of Windows with
absolutely nothing else running we have
things like steam running origin you
play battlenet epic games launcher
there's discord on there running not
that it's doing anything about chatting
or anyone but it's they're open in a
chat session we have chrome with a few
tabs open there's 10 tabs in total and
then we have MSI Afterburner rivatuner
collecting some on-screen statistics for
us and then fraps I should also note
that all testing has been conducted at
4k use in the highest possible quality
preset again with an RT X xx atti so
starting with Assassin's Creed Odyssey
we see around 29%
of our 32 gigabytes allocated throughout
our testing this RAM usage hovered
between nine and a half to nine point
three gigabytes with me RAM usage around
8.1 to 8.2 gigabytes
this suggests that a system with just 8
gigabytes of RAM could see performance
issues in this game moving on we have
battlefield 5 multiplayer using the 64
player mode here RAM usage gets up to
around 33% hitting 10.8 gigabytes and
basically never dropping below 10 point
4 gigabytes vram allocation was also
very high holding steady at nine point
seven gigabytes on the Narvik map so
again we have another tile that will
likely run into stuttering issues with 8
gigabytes of memory next up we have call
of duty black ops 4 and this title is a
serious memory Pig at least based on the
small amount of testing they've done
with this title Ram allocation held
pretty steady at 12 gigabytes while VRAM
usage was also very high at 10.5
gigabytes
making this the most demanding title
that we've tested yet f1 2018 is a title
that you'll probably get away just fine
using 8 gigabytes of memory as we saw
system memory usage peak at 8.5
gigabytes
that's right on the edge for sure but
you'll probably get away with that at
the 4k resolution VRAM usage was quite
high at seven and a half gigabytes but
any GPU that can handle this extreme
resolution will have at least 8
gigabytes of vram anyway next up we have
Far Cry 5 and here we saw RAM usage hit
9 point 8 gigabytes though VRAM usage
was still reasonably low at five point
eight gigabytes still that almost 10
gigabytes of system memory you're
starting to get a bit too far beyond
what an eight gigabyte RAM capacity will
let you get away with hit man to push
total system memory allocation just over
10 gigabytes for the entirety of our
test and we saw at peak at ten point
three gigabytes VRAM usage was also
similar to what we saw in Far Cry 5 at
around 5.6 gigabytes
just cause 4 was very light on memory
though avalanches apex game engine is
seriously showing its age in 2018
less than 7 gigabytes of RAM was
allocated in total and less than 5
gigabytes of vram was consumed
monster hunter world is a title that
should work just fine with a gigabytes
of RAM here we saw allocation peak at
8.3 gigabytes and VRAM usage was also
quite low under five gigabytes shut off
the Tomb Raider was certainly one of the
best looking games released this year
and while it uses a reasonable amount of
system memory it's certainly not extreme
at around nine gigabytes VRAM usage
though was quite high consistently using
just over eight gigabytes Star Wars
Battlefront - as a memory intensive
title and here we were consistently
seeing RAM allocation pushed above 10
gigabytes generally - around ten and a
half gigabytes VRAM usage was also quite
high at around 8.30 bytes second last
game we're going to look at a strange
Brigade and this is a well optimized
title that runs very well on a wide
range of hardware therefore it wasn't
surprising to find that the memory
requirements aren't that high just seven
and a half gigabytes of RAM was
allocated though what the 4k resolution
VRAM usage did still hit six and a half
gigabytes certainly nothing extreme
there but higher than some of the titles
we've tested so far last up we have
vermintide - and here system memory
allocation hit nine gigabytes while VRAM
usage was relatively low at five and a
half gigabytes this is a title that you
probably could play with eight gigabytes
of RAM but you would be right on the
edge okay so now that we've had a look
at memory allocation using a high-end
hardware and a dozen tiles released this
year let's take a closer look at the
performance numbers when testing
battlefield 5 hitman 2 and shut off the
term roundup' I'll be doing this in two
parts firstly with high end GPUs at
1440p and 4k and then with mid-range
GPUs at 1080p and 1440p please note for
all this testing I'm still using the
kora 999 or okay test system the only
hardware changes other than the graphics
cards is obviously the memory for all
the memory testing I'm using team groups
T force dark for the 8 gigabyte
configuration either kit with 2 4
gigabyte sticks using self 15 timings
and then basically we've used the same
type of memory but with 8 gigabyte
modules for a 16 gigabyte capacity then
for the 32 gigabyte testing I'm not
going to go with just two sticks I'm
going to actually use a 4 of the 8
gigabyte modules so - 16 gigabyte kits
giving us a 32 gigabyte capacity team
group does offer a 32 gigabyte kit with
just two 6 thinking about modules but
they use looser timing so I opted for
using the 8 gigabyte sticks instead so
that way we have the same timings across
all tests
figurations okay so first up we once
again have the r-tx 2082 i but this time
on hand for testing we also have vega 64
liquid and the gtx 1070 starting with
battlefield 5 at 1440p we see virtually
no difference in performance between
these 16 and 32 gigabyte configurations
and given what we just saw when looking
at the on-screen statistics this
shouldn't surprise anyone however as we
reduce the system memory capacity to 8
gigabytes we start to see a reduction in
performance at least we're looking at
the frame time performance that is the
average frame rates are at most 2 FPS
change but if we look at the 1% low and
in particular the 0.1% low results we
see that the frame rates have become a
less consistent for the r-tx 28 ETA we
see up to a 7 percent drop in frame time
performance 8% for Vega 64 and 7% for
the gtx 1070 moving to the 4k resolution
and here the r-tx 20 ADC is frame time
results suffers by 5% but more
interestingly than that is the
noticeable reduction in performance when
going from a 32-year bytes to 16
gigabytes which was very unexpected
furthermore the 0.1% low result is
reduced by 10% we're going from 32
gigabytes down to 8 gigabytes however
for the much more heavily GPU bound
configurations using Vega 64 in the GTX
1070 we see that the memory capacities
have little impact on performance at the
4k resolution the hitman 2 results are
interesting for a few reasons firstly
the r-tx 2082 I consistently saw a
performance reduction as we lowered the
amount of available system memory and it
wasn't just frame time performance that
suffered we saw previously this game was
quite memory hungry but 16 gigabytes of
RAM really should be more than enough to
cover it so it's interesting to see 32
gigabytes offering a 4 to 5 percent
performance boost that said the
performance game with the 32 gigabyte
configuration wasn't seen when using
either Vega 64 or the gtx 1070 in fact
vega 64 delivered the same performance
across the board whether the system had
8 or 32 gigabytes of memory but with the
gtx 1070 while we do see these same
performance with 16 and 32 gigabytes of
ram the frame time performance starts to
really suffer with just a gigabytes
here we see an 11 percent drop in the
0.1 percent low performance moving to
the 4k resolution and here we again
see better performance for the r-tx 2082
I went paired with 32 gigabytes of
system memory this time frame time
performance was boosted by as much as
seven percent again Vegas 64 saw no
change in performance even with 8
gigabytes of RAM and in the gtx 1070 was
much the same though again we did see a
small drop off with just a gear bytes of
ram shut off the Tomb Raider has some
very interesting results for us for this
title the r-tx 28 ET i delivered the
same results whether it was using either
16 or 32 gigabytes of RAM was all much
the same however with just 8 gigabytes
the performance hit was massive though
you wouldn't know it if you just focused
on the average frame rate the hit to
frame time performance though was
substantial and at times the stuttering
in-game was very noticeable here we saw
up to a 32 percent drop for the 0.1% low
result that said once again the
performance it for Vega 64 is in that
extreme at most we saw an 11% reduction
in performance while the hit for the gtx
1070 was much more severe at 23% then
moving to 4k we see at the ihx 28 ET i
doesn't suffer nearly as badly with just
8 gigabytes of memory though we do see a
reasonable drop-off for Vega 64 in the
gtx 1070 we're looking at frame time
performance so bit of a reversal there
okay so previously we've found that it's
the lower end graphics cards featuring
less of VRAM that suffer the most when
running with limited system memory so I
went back and retested all over again
with the radiant rx 588 gigabyte RX 574
gigabyte and GTX 1063 gigabyte at 1080p
and 1440p so let's see what kind of
impact the various Ram capacities had on
these configurations first that we have
battlefield 5 and as expected little to
no difference between 16 and 32
gigabytes
however with just 8 gigabytes we see a
noticeable performance hit to the RX 570
and gtx 1060 so much so that even the
average frame rates dipped we saw this
in the last year's test that is the 3
gigabyte gtx 1060 really struggling with
frame time performance and modern tiles
when using less than 16 gigabytes of
system memory naturally the situation
isn't improved at 1440p though it's
really interesting just how much the RX
570 suffers with just a gigabytes of RAM
in this title they hit for the 3
gigabyte GTX 1060 is pretty
sniffing as well but damn does that
radio and GPU get hit really hard
basically you don't want to be playing
battlefield 5 multiplayer with just 8
gigabytes of around especially if you
have a lower-end GP with 4 gigabytes or
less vram that's said for titles such as
hitman 2 the performance is basically
non-existent we're not seeing much
outside of the margin of error here the
margins do open up a little bit at 1440p
for the 3 gigabyte gtx 1060 when paired
with just 8 gigabytes of ram but overall
nothing too extreme
as seen previously with high end GPUs
shut off the Tomb Raider does run into a
few issues with just 8 gigabytes of RAM
and we're certainly seeing that here
with these three mid-range graphics
cards they hit 2 frame time performance
in particularly 0.1% Lowe's was quite
extreme for all three configurations
naturally this was also seen at 1440p
and here the 3 gigabyte gtx 1060 really
tanked with frequent and very noticeable
frames stuttering being a big problem
the 1440p resolution also proved to be a
bit much for the RX 570 ok so at this
point I've probably hit even the most
dedicated Harbor on box viewers with
enough benchmark numbers time to start
wrapping this one up it seems pretty
clear at this point if you want to play
the latest and greatest the most
demanding titles you'll want 16
gigabytes of RAM I found this time last
year that 8 gigabytes really was the
bare minimum and now that's truer than
ever of course if you play less
demanding tales such as fortnight
overwatch a rocket League for example or
old but still very popular titles such
as dota 2 and csgo then a gigabytes of
system memory will be plenty but if you
want to get amongst it in battlefield 5
or enjoy the breathtaking visual scene
and shut off the Tomb Raider without the
constant reminder that your system isn't
quite up to par then I'd recommend
getting at least 16 gigabytes that said
for mid-range to lower end rigs where -
stuttering can at times be caused by a
lack of erm a slow storage device not
quite enough CPU cores and so on
being on the edge for memory capacity
probably isn't going to make that much
difference for example a core i3 a t3
50k system with a basic TLC SSD a
graphics car with 2 to 3 gigabytes of
vram you're gonna see some stuttering
and titles such as battlefield 5 so
upgrading from a gigabyte 16 gigabytes
of RAM will certainly help it's not
going to completely solve the stuttering
issues alternatively those rockin
high-end hardware you know something
like an RT X 2082 IO
all this talk about memory capacity is
kinda redundant anyway just get 32
gigabytes and forget about it after all
if you're spending at least $1300 u.s.
on a graphics card and you honestly
going to think twice about spending
three to $400 u.s. on ddr4 memory
probably not for most of you 16
gigabytes is going to be the sweet spot
and this is what I recommend so in a
nutshell for today's latest games eight
gigabytes really does seem to be out now
sixteen gigabytes is the sweet spot as I
said and 32 gigabytes is still overkill
and that is going to do it for this one
