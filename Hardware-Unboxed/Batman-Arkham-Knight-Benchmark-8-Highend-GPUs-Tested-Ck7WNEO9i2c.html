unboxed I'm your benchmarking Dark
Knight Matt and today we're going to be
benchmarking the brand new batman arkham
knight game and max settings with a to
the fastest GPUs from AMD in the video
apart from the fury x because we only
just got the sample this afternoon by
now it's pretty clear that Arkham Knight
hasn't exactly had the smoothest of
launchers in fact during the production
this very video Warner Brothers is
actually pulled sales of the pc game
from the market and they're actually
offering game as a full refund after
being absolutely inundated with
complaints about performance both AMD
and NVIDIA users have been complaining
about the heavy stuttering and poor
performance since the release although
it does seem to be mainly coming from
those is in low to mid-range hardware I
can honestly say we've tested the
absolute that due to out of this game
and we only ever had the stuttering
issues when we weren't using the latest
release drivers from a video or AMD that
said it certainly wasn't without its
issues when we open up this game we were
pretty wrapped to see there was a
built-in bench mark because this usually
makes the benchmarking process a whole
lot easier except there was a huge
problem the benchmark results weren't at
all in line with what we experience when
playing as soon as we hopped in the
Batmobile in started hammering around
driving through buildings performance
drops significantly this is when we
decided to do our own custom benchmark
using fraps but those interested we have
attached a 60-second custom perhaps
benchmark at the end of the video so be
sure to check that out as I mentioned
earlier we benchmark the game with eight
of the fastest GPU is available on the
market and we've done so at 1080p 1440p
and 4k now we've got results for the
built-in benchmark and their own custom
benchmark we're going to show you the
built-in benchmark results first as you
can see the built-in benchmark results
are excellent using the r9 290 GTX 970
or anything faster we didn't see minimum
frame rates below fifty three frames per
second so silky smooth game
players should have been expected as a
side note it was great to see that
despite this being a game wife's title
performance on the AMD GPUs was really
good too next up we've got the 1440p
results again we see really smooth
performance from all cards where we saw
em dig at the slight edge in most
battles at 1080p we now see them getting
very slightly edged out by the nvidia
cards at 1440p owners of all these cards
would be optimistic about gameplay
performance have you seen these
benchmark results at 1440p on max
settings lastly let's take a look at the
4k results it's that 4k that we start to
see the separation between the elite
cards in this built-in bench market 4k
only the Titan nexon 980 TI were able to
deliver minimum frame rates above 30
frames per second so I bet you're
detecting my hesitation unfortunately
our real game player results in some
cases only delivered half of the frames
that built in benchmark produced let me
show you first at 1080p there seemed to
be some sort of bottleneck at 1080p and
real gameplay that didn't exist in the
built-in benchmark you would expect
significantly better frame rates from
these high-end cards at least what we
were getting in the built-in bench mark
but that just wasn't the case in the
real game player tests all cards were
seemingly limited by this bottleneck
which saw even the tight necks reduces
us 44 frames per second on average this
is within four frames of the r9 290 and
dwarfed by the 97 frames it averaged in
the built-in benchmark while this was
obviously playable it was well beneath
what you'd expect from these cards at
1440p we see more evidence of the bottle
now the Titan X could only produce six
frames more than the r9 290 on average
and all cards were reduced to between 29
and 32 frame minimums you'll also notice
that there is almost no difference
between the 1080p results and the 1440p
results often just one to two frames
again this was playable however it did
feel a little jittery especially when
going around corners we didn't have any
of the major stuttering issues though
that users were reporting at 4k we saw
all the cards here what are most likely
they're real limits potentially
unaffected by the bottleneck the time
next in the 980 TI over the only cards
are delivered what can be
consider playable performance and even
they felt a little laggy 4k gamers
should be hoping when the game is
eventually rerelease it is far better
optimized some might even tolerate it on
the regular to 90 or 390 however if it
was me I definitely be tweaking some of
the quality settings down not you can
actually change much in this game or
just conceding and turning the
resolution down to ensure smooth
gameplay so as you can see if you pcs
equipped to one of the eight cards that
we looked at today you should be able to
play max settings at 1440p or lower it's
very obvious now that this game requires
a lot more optimization or a complete
overhaul before it could be considered a
final product and it would seem that the
development teams really got their work
cut out for them considering they
decided to pull the entire game from the
market just a couple of days after
selling I know I'm certainly glad that
I'm not on the developer team right now
if you'd like us to test the game in its
current state with some mid or low range
cards let us know in the comments will
definitely be following up this video
when the game is eventually re-released
and I guess for now do we just chalk
this up as a win for the Joker love your
bed Jim golf Oscar five six this is
Commissioner Gordon I'm calling off the
pursuit it's too dangerous so right here
we can take these bastards
they're getting away
it's just part of appreciating us
how are these guys bisex home until
that's an order but Batman deal with
this please Batman you've got to stop
don't worry he's mine
