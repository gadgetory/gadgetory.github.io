extreme gaming version of the geforce
gtx 1060 that i unboxed a few weeks ago
already we've checked out the gigabyte
extreme gaming 1070 and 1080 graphics
cards both of which were most impressive
despite coming at a slight price premium
paying a little extra for a 1070 or 1080
graphics card that runs cool and quiet
isn't a big deal the 1060 on the other
hand could be a different story for
starters the 1060 already runs very cool
and quiet thanks to its less complex
design the 1060 is also somewhat of a
budget GPU priced at $250 for the 6
gigabyte model perhaps the most
important factor though is that it has
real competition unlike the upper tier
Pascal cards the 1060 has to deal with a
slightly cheaper RX 480
so inflating the price doesn't exactly
help to improve the 1060 s position that
being said let's get the ugly business
out of the way now the 1060 extreme cost
$300 this is obviously quite a lot more
than the $250 windforce version so what
are you getting by paying 20% more well
let's find out compared to your typical
gtx 1060 the extreme gaming model is
huge in fact it's virtually the same
size as the much more expensive 1070 and
1080 models unless there's some sort of
unexpected overclocking potential
waiting to be tapped making a gtx 1060
this big doesn't really make a heap of
sense still it does look impressive but
is there more to this graphics card than
a big fan shroud and a pair of 100
millimeter fans removing the cooler
reveals that there is indeed something
under that lid as was the case with the
1070 and 1080 extreme gaming models we
find two large arrays of aluminium fins
connected to a large copper base via a
series of copper heat pipes in total the
cooler way 707 grams which isn't much
lighter than the 791 grams cooler of the
1070 model this is also a good bit
heavier than 658 gram cooler asu's users
on the 1070 Strix model when compared to
the 1070 extreme gaming cooler there
really isn't much of a difference which
isn't surprising given this roughly
attempts and difference in total weight
without question this massive cooler
won't have any trouble keeping the gtx
1060
cool I can't imagine the fans will be
required to spin up much even under
heavy load moving to the PCB itself
which has been given the same aerospace
coding of the more costly extreme gaming
models we find a number of upgrades
along with the Titan Xcode chokes and
capacitors we find an upgraded 6+1 power
phase design which should help to lower
temperatures and maximize the cards of a
clocking potential gigabyte is also
upgraded to an 8-pin PCIe power
connector that's said I should point out
that these exact same upgrades are made
to the cheaper g1 gaming model as well
for those of you unaware the Nvidia
founders edition model only features a
3+1 power phase design along with a
single 6-pin connector something the g1
gaming model doesn't include are the
rear mounted internal HDMI outputs for
more convenient front mounted VR support
keep I call this feature extreme VR link
unfortunately the VR link Bay isn't
included in the package and unlike the
1070 and 1080 models there isn't a
premium pack edition honestly I'd hoped
given the price this gear would have
been included in the package still
you're getting that massive cooler an
impressive looking full-length backplate
and some fancy igb lighting the sixteen
point eight million color customizable
lighting is a fun novelty edition but
will for some help justify the price
premium another area where the extreme
gaming upsets game is in the factory
overclocking Department out of the box
the g1 gaming operates at eighteen
hundred and nine megahertz boost
frequency the extreme gaming goes a bit
further at eighteen hundred and forty
seven megahertz that's still only an 8%
increase over the fans Edition model but
as far as a factory overclock goes
that's a pretty decent one given how
variable the boost clock frequency is
with GPU boost 3.0 will be interesting
to see how much if any difference is
extra factory overclock makes that being
said let's jump into the benchmarks
first up we have ARMA 3 sadly the
extreme gaming doesn't stand out as the
superior 1060 here only matching the g1
gaming out of the box and overclocked
hmm not much else to say here either
despite that big factory overclock the
extreme gaming is just 1 FPS faster out
of the box when compared to the g1
gaming well I'm starting to detect the
trend here out of the box the extreme
gaming not only match the g1 gaming but
it was also unable
pull away from the palette super
Jetstream again nothing to see here in
the division the extreme gaming isn't
able to distance itself from the more
affordable 1060 graphics cards even when
overclocked what do we have here more of
the same it seems no surprises in Far
Cry primal alright time to wrap this up
it's pretty evident now that slapping a
massive cooler on the gtx 1060 doesn't
help improve performance or customer
clocking power consumption for the
extreme game is on par with the g1
gaming along with pallid super jet
stream okay so finally we see our first
real evidence that massive cooler paying
off out of the box the extreme game you
never exceeded 59 degrees in our gaming
stress tests making it 5 degrees cooler
than the g1 gaming model even
overclocked the card only reached 60
degrees and ran virtually silent
temperatures aside there really isn't
any tallying the extreme gaming apart
from models such as the g1 gaming this
is a shame but given how GPU boost 3.0
technology works it isn't entirely
surprising either the extreme gaming
obviously isn't cheaper $300 but the g1
gaming isn't much better at 290 dollars
those after a $250 MSRP card from
gigabyte will need to invest in the
windforce d5 six gigabyte model
interestingly that model features the
same six plus one power phase design and
8 p.m. power input as far as we can tell
the only real difference is the cut-down
cooler so there's every chance you'll
see the same frame rate performance from
this model as well for me the gtx 1060
extreme gaming seems to be a graphics
card designed for games who wish they
could afford the 1080 but a happy paying
a premium to pretend they've got one
gigabyte eventually end up selling this
beefy 1064 and 270 dollars then we can
probably justify the purchase but at 300
bucks is just too pricey given there's
no extra performance to be had what do
you guys think let me know in the
comments
I'm your host man as always and I'll see
you guys next time cheers guys for
joining me for another episode of
hardware unbox so those of you that
already support the channel thank you so
much it's truly appreciated and to those
of you that would like to support the
channel directly I do have Amazon links
and a patreon link in the video
description below thanks a lot and I'll
see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
