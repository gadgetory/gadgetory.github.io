Computex coverage today we're talking
about AMD's new risin thread Ripper CPUs
as well as intel's new core x-series but
before we get to that a quick word about
our sponsor MSI once again a big thanks
to MSI for bringing me here this year I
wouldn't be here without them if you're
in the market for a new gaming desktop
PC then check out msi high-end core i7
systems right now they're offering a
free you play game key for Tom Clancy's
Ghost Recon wildlands with select
purchases link is in the video
description as we all expected Intel
revealed its new family of Clorox
enthusiast grade processors at Computex
while AMD revealed more details
regarding thread Ripper so let's talk
about the CPUs and make a few
comparisons though before we get too far
into it please note we don't have any
official model names clock speeds or
pricing info for the thread Ripper
series while the clock speeds for
intel's higher-end core i 9 series is
yet to be revealed as well so for Intel
sitting at the head of the family is
their answer to AMD's 16 core 32 thread
CPU the eye-watering core I 979 ATX II
and I say I watering not because it
boasts an incredible 18 cores and 36
threads but because it will set your
back $2,000 us the price might seem
extreme for the flagship model but
Intel's also releasing a 4 6 8 10 12 14
and 16 core model in what looks to be an
outright assault on AMD the Zen
architecture has clearly a fire under
Intel and all this competition is good
news for us for the consumer the brand
new core x-series includes CPUs based on
not just the sky like X architecture but
also the KB like X architecture as well
all CPUs that have a core count of
anywhere from 6 to 18 cores are based on
Scylla X while the quad cores use the
cable 8x architecture AMD's already
fired the first shots with their four
core six core and eight core models and
we're of course expecting the 10 12 14
and 16 core versions very soon now not
wanting to simply just match Ami's core
count intel's going one step four
other with the core i 9 79 80 XE by
hitting 18 cause of course this is
essentially a Titan XP of the CPU world
so I'm not really sure how relevant it
will end up being anyway for those with
money to burn is the 18 core model even
worth whatever premium ends up costing
over thread Ripper and what does all
that moolah land you well Intel says the
I 979 ATX e is the first-ever teraflop
desktop PC processor so I guess there's
that you also get a CPU with a truly
massive 18 megabytes of level 2 cache so
that's 1 megabyte per core and then
there's a shared twenty four point seven
five megabyte level three cache at this
point the operating frequency
information isn't known at least the
base clock frequency anyway using turbo
boost max 3.0 technology a core or two
should be able to hit around 4.5
gigahertz but again this hasn't been
confirmed for such a monstrous processor
you might be expecting a thermal design
rating in excess of 200 watts well the
good news is the TDP rating has been set
and it's just 165 watts which is quite
impressive and although that should make
Fillmore's quite manageable Intel is
still selling its own liquid cooler
design for the 165 watt TDP and 140 watt
TDP chips the cooler has an estimated
retail price of somewhere between 80 and
100 dollars u.s. and it works with some
of the previous generation CPUs as well
for those of you who can't justify
dropping 2k on a CPU there is the core I
979 60 X for the much more
wallet-friendly
$1,700 u.s. and yeah I kid of course
what's interesting here is that this
model boasts the same coil count as
Intel's upcoming flagship the Red River
CPU rumored to be called the horizon 9
1998 X we now know that all AMD Rison
thread Ripper CPUs will have
quad-channel ddr4 memory support as well
as an incredible 64 PCI Express gen3
lanes that's 20 more lanes that Intel's
highest end skylake x core I 9 processes
and incredibly 40 more lanes than its
eight core and six
core Core i7 models so it seems AMD
certainly has Intel against the ropes
when it comes to PCI Express Lanes and
I'm pretty sure those X 399 motherboards
are going to be quite incredible and
well we'll take a look at some of those
in a moment so with the eight core
Verizon 7 1800 X currently priced at
$500 us and the 1700 model which is
essentially the same thing costing just
three hundred and ten dollars us how
much can the 16 core rise in CPU really
cost well as I said earlier I don't
actually know the price of any of the
thread Ripper CPUs but it would have to
be over or well over double the price of
the most expensive eight core model
being the 1800 X to come even close to
the core I 970 960 X so that's something
to ponder
anyway the core I 970 960 X will feature
a 16 megabyte level 2 cache which is
quite large and again that's one
megabyte per core as well as 22
megabytes of level 3 memory supports the
same for all skylight X processor so
that means we get quad-channel
ddr4 2666 memory the TDP is also locked
in at 165 watts and again for now the
base clock of this model is yet to be
announced
Intel claims that when compared to
Broadway lead ships such as the $1700 10
core Core i7 69 50 X the new 10 core
model offers 15% faster single thread
performance and is up to 10% faster when
it comes to multi-threaded tasks so
naturally for multi-threaded workloads
the 79 60 X is going to crush the 69 50
X albeit for the same ludicrous price
anyone want to buy my 69 50 X any takers
dropping down to the low low price of
$1400 u.s. we find the core I 979 40 X a
14 core model with a 14 megabyte level 2
cache and a 19 point 2 5 megabyte level
3 cache again you get quad-channel ddr4
memory support and the same 165 watt TDP
then we have the 12 core core I 979 20x
which comes in at $1,200 us and now
we're starting to nudge towards that
original extreme price of $1,000 with
this phone you get 12 megabytes of level
2 cache and 16 and a half mega
lots of level three cache the TDP has
now been lowered to 140 watts for this
model but you still get quad-channel
ddr4 2666 memory support and all 44 PCI
Express Lanes stepping in from a 1650 X
is the core I 970 100x the new 10 core
20 thread model this processor comes in
at the same price as the earlier Extreme
Edition models such as the core i7 965
Extreme Edition so $1000
we know this model will operate all
cores at a base frequency of 3.3
gigahertz and that's a nice little 10%
boost over the 69 50 X that said the new
70 100x does only support a 13 point 75
mega byte level 3 cache and that's
almost half that of the 69 50 X however
whereas the 69 50 X only has a two and a
half mega byte level to cache this 70
100x has a huge 10 megabyte level 2
cache by comparison the level 2 cache is
considerably faster than the level 3 so
having more should really help Bruce
performance quite substantially but we
won't know until we test the processes
for ourselves
finally the 10 core model has been given
the same 140 watt TDP rating as a 12
core model we get quad-channel ddr4
memory and 44 PCIe lanes ok so this is
where it gets really interesting the
eight core 16 thread core i7 78 20x
featuring an MSRP of $600 that means
we're seeing a massive 40 percent
reduction in price when compared to the
10 core model and of course we are
seeing just a 20% reduction in core
assets
this means that 78 20x will come in 20%
more expensive than AMD's Rison 7 1800 X
and awkwardly almost twice the price as
the 1700 model so it could look like a
reasonable deal next to the 1800 X but
it's unlikely to look too good next to
the 1700 it comes clocked at 3.6
gigahertz for all calls but can boost as
high as 4 point 5 gigahertz so that is a
higher clock speed than rising can
currently achieve but whether it'll be
enough to justify the price increase is
yet to be determined this is another 140
watt part but I should point out that
the PCI lanes have been reduced to just
28 though this is still enough for most
our users still as noted earlier this is
a massive 56% reduction in lanes when
compared to even the base model AMD
risin thread Ripper CPU now for the 6
chord 12 thread model and Intel has a
lot riding here as you probably know the
horizon 5 1600 X is considered to be the
golden chip of the entire Rison lineup
and at just 220 dollars u.s. it's pretty
hard to beat that being the case it
seems like Intel's not really even going
to try bothering as their six core Core
i7 7800 X is set to come in at three
hundred ninety dollars u.s. that's not
really a significant saving over the
current six core Broadway leadership
which I kind of consider to be
irrelevant at its current price so at
just 10% cheaper than the 6800 okay I'm
not really sure how popular Intel's new
6th core parts going to be any way out
of the box this model can boost as high
as 4 gigahertz and it has a base
operating frequency of 3.5 gigahertz it
also packs 6 megabytes as level 2 cache
and 8.25 megabytes of level 3 cache
again it is 140 watt model with 28 PCI
Express Lanes
with the six core models still coming in
at almost $400 that leaves some room for
lower tier models so Intel is offering
some quad cores on the X 299 platform
the fastest of which is the core i7 7740
X priced at $240 it comes in at the same
price as the core i7 7700 ok I think
most will agree with me though when I
say I don't really get what the point of
this model is it's not a great deal
cheaper than the 6 core model and yet it
only features dual channel memory
support and a mere 16 PCI Express Lanes
so I guess my question is why offer such
a measly CPU on a flagship platform that
will no doubt be dominated by super
expensive motherboards it's almost a
joke that the entry-level thread Ripper
CPU will support three times more PCI
Express Lanes
perhaps even more puzzling is the 240
dollar Core i5 77 40 X which is another
quad core part that lacks
hyper-threading support so just four
threads are on offer here so for $20
more than the Rison 5 1600
Intel's giving us a traditional core i5
I won't bother reading out the specs for
this one I'm pretty sure it's going to
be a waste of your time kind of like
another core i3 73 50 K situation I'll
pretty much simply tell you guys don't
buy it before wrapping things up I
checked out 2x3 99 motherboards over at
the Azeroth booth the first of which is
the X 399 Taichi and this board does a
pretty good job of trying to tackle
those PCI Express Lanes with 4 PCIe x 16
slots and 3 M 2 slots as you can see
that massive tr4 socket occupies a huge
amount of space on the board as do the
egg DIMM slots asrock also had their x3
99 professional gaming on display and
the core specifications are quite
similar to the Taichi board though you
do get creative audio on this one and 10
Gigabit Ethernet which is very cool as I
live in the asrock booth I also spotted
this little sucker a mini ITX X $2.99
motherboard so it looks like you'll be
able to create an 18 core core o.9 rig
in a shoebox size PC if you want to do
that kind of thing
this tiny board wasn't light on features
either offering six SATA ports 3m 2
ports I know three on a mini ITX board
it's pretty incredible
there was also a load of USB 3 ports
numerous networking options and support
for quad channel memory via for laptops
tile DIMM slots impressive stuff and I'm
very keen to check out these new asrock
boards soon so to recap Intel's new core
X series certainly looks very
interesting and perhaps even a bit
confusing they're clearly feeling the
heat from Rison and going with an
all-out assault by the way the release
date for the first wave of chips is the
19th of June and on-hand for testing I
will have the 10 core core I 970 100 X
and 4 core Core i7 7740 X lastly please
let me know what you guys think about
Intel's new core X lineup and your take
on the prices I'm your host Steve see
you again soon guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
