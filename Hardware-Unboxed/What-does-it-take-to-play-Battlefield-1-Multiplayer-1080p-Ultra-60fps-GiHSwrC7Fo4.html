this is the first of what I hope will be
many what does it take to play type
videos
the idea is to quickly or quickly for me
anyway address the kind of hardware
gamers require to play certain games
using certain settings take this video
for example what does it take to play
battlefield 1 multiplayer at 1080p the
goal this time will be to target at
least 60 FPS using the ultra quality
preset at 1920 by 1080 in the big 64
player battles please note this isn't a
big benchmark video how it's not really
even a benchmark video at all
I'm simply testing a single hardware
configuration that I've found to deliver
the perfect balance of price versus
performance in the chosen title I mean
come on guys after all not every hub
video has to be a benchmark marathon
anyway the focus here will be on new
hardware and although I will be testing
just a single new hardware configuration
I will also discuss acceptable
alternatives so if the smooth
performance in all of the battlefield 1
multiplayer modes
I recommend a true quad-core processor
ideally I would have gone with something
like the core i5 7400 but since it's
currently priced a bit above $182 MSRP
right now I went with the core i5 6400
instead which can be had for the $182
MSRP
truth be told though both processors are
going to deliver virtually the same
experience anyway particularly given we
are using a sensible graphics card here
in the Radeon rx for 70 with that
question right now the best value sub
$200 graphics card is either the rx 470
or the 4 gigabyte RX 480 that's on sale
since the RX 470 can easily push over 60
fps and battlefield 1 using the ultra
quality settings this is what I went
with
over the weekend I spent a few hours
playing with this rig and I was very
satisfied with the performance for the
most part frame rate seemed to hover
around 70 FPS and on a 60 Hertz display
with vsync enable you're going to see
very very smooth performance for those
wondering the system was configured with
16 gigabytes of memory which was a bit
of an oversight but unfortunately right
now I only have 8 gigabyte ddr4 modules
and I didn't really want to run the
system in the single-channel mode even
if it doesn't make that much
difference anyway I recommend if you are
stretching your budget to get a core i5
processor with the RX 470 to save a
little bit of cash then just get an 8
gigabyte kit also please note that the
memory was down clock to the ddr4 2133
spec as this is likely the memory
frequency most locked skylake core i5
owners will be running on a h 100 or
p150 motherboard for example also the
performance seen here was recorded using
their sous RX 470 Strix practice card
depending on how sticky you are it is
possible to use the new pentium g 45 60
processor though be aware at times you
will notice stuttering it's far from
extreme but wasn't noticeable at times
older unlocked core i5 processors such
as the 2500 k also worked well when
overclocked to around 4 gigahertz or
more so to recap for you guys wanting to
play 64 player battlefield 1 and are
looking at building a new pc or
upgrading an old one I recommend for
optimal performance starting with an
entry-level Scylla core cable a Core i5
and of course pairing it with AMD's RX
470 or possibly the 4 gigabyte R X 480
depending on pricing are there any other
games you'd like me to check out with
certain test criterias such as targeted
frame rates quality settings and
resolution for example if so let me know
about it in the comment section below
and I'll try to get one of these videos
out per week I'm your host Steve have
fun gaming
we have taken objective George
