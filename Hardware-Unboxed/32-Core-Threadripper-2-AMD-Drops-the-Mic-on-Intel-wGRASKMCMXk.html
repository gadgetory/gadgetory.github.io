sponsoring our Computex 2018 coverage
check out courses fancy new Vengeance
RGB memory and if you're thinking of
upgrading your gaming monitor MSI optics
mpg curved gaming monitors come back
with a 144 Hertz refresh rate 1,800 our
curvature and up to 1440p resolution for
a limited time they include a free
SteelSeries mouse pad and steam giftcard
with every purchase in selected
countries see the link in the
description to upgrade your game with
MSI welcome back to hard run box I've
just gotten back from AMD's 2018
Computex press event and there was a
whole range of really cool things on
show I'm gonna tell you about in just a
moment I raced all the way back to our
hotel room to film this video and as you
can see AMD has given me a t-shirt for
my efforts says thread Ripert's
second-generation on it so i'm sure you
can guess exactly what we'll be talking
about in this video without wasting any
more of your time let's get straight
into the details on second-generation
thread Ripper the cool thing that AMD
announced was the fact that there will
be a 32 cores 64 threaded second gen
thread Ripper processor which goes well
above the 16 core 32 thread processor
that we got with the first generation
line unfortunately while we do know
there's a 32 core processor coming we
don't have any other official details so
we don't know the final clock speeds
cache configuration TDP or pricing
however AMD did give some information on
their thread Ripper to engineering
sample test systems which were clocked
in a 3.0 gigahertz base and turbo up to
a 3.4 gigahertz or core boost although
those specs aren't final and they also
lists a 250 watt TDP though power
consumption apparently won't be that
high in most workloads and for testing
they used an air cooler called the
wraith Ripper that we haven't seen just
yet but we do know it's built on a 12
nanometer processing node and it uses
the Zen plus architecture so that
shouldn't come as a surprise considering
we got both of those features with
second-generation
Rison AMD did show off a second
generation thread Ripper processor
including a deleted version of that chip
so we can see the four separate dies
that are included this is the same as
first generation thread Ripper however
with this second gen 32 core model of
course all four of those dies will be
active there are no dummy dies in this
process of like with the first
generation
Art's an antic also discovered that
while the 32 course cue will have four
active dyes only two will have direct
access to memory channels while the
other two will need to access memory
through the Infinity fabric AMD says
this should only impact memory heavy
workloads and he also has a 24 call
thread rescue in the works though at
this point we're not sure what is being
disabled to achieve that core count
whether it's a whole eight cord die or
perhaps two cores per die
second-generation thread Ripper CPUs
will be supported on the x3 99 platform
and will slot into existing x3 99
motherboards so that explains why
companies like MSI are beefing up their
x3 99 options with improved VRMs we have
heard that that 32 core CPU will come
with a TDP of 250 watts so you'll
certainly need improved power delivery
and better coolers to handle these new
processes AMD did state the second
Channel thread Ripper will be ready in
the third quarter of 2018
we have heard specifically that it will
be August that these chips are coming
out first generation third Ripper came
out in August of 2017 so it makes sense
that the second gen comes out in August
of 2018 we don't know any other details
on that to share but it is super
exciting that we are getting a 32 core
processor in the works from a MIDI in
there thread Ripper line in fact we did
actually see some performance figures
for the 32 cord chip we saw that run a
blender benchmark it did some intensive
processing unfortunately AMD didn't
compare the 32 core processor to any
other of their chips or any other chips
from the competition they did however
use a 24 course cue and compared that to
the 18 core Intel Core I 979 ATX East
that's an 18 core CPU there and they did
finish a blender workload around 5
seconds faster than the Intel processor
around 29 seconds on the thread Ripper
2nd gen 24 core part and again 5 seconds
longer on the intel part so very early
performance numbers there for the 2nd
gen thread Ripper CPUs but hopefully we
could be getting some more details about
that in the coming months as far as GPUs
are concerned AMD didn't have as much to
share they did state that 7 nanometre
Vega is now sampling to select customers
and is on track for release in the
second half of 2018 then of course we
still expect the first 7 innovative Vega
products will be part of their Radeon
instinct line that said aim be did tease
that 7 nanometre Vega will be
to gaming products in the near future so
stay tuned for that that they weren't
willing to give any additional details
at the moment anybody did give us an
idea though of what the seven nanometer
node will provide relative to the 40
nanometer known for Vega including twice
the density and twice the power
efficiency of the 14 nanometer node and
we're also expecting around 1.3 five
times the performance so hopefully that
will translate to those gaming products
built with seven nanometer Vega in the
coming months if you address it in
laptops built on the rise in you series
line we did get a range of new designs
on show from companies like a soos and
Huawei for the first time these laptops
include the HP Envy x-360 13-inch we've
got the new as sous 15-inch slim and
light we've gotten a sous laptop with
Rison an Nvidia graphics though a Nova
IdeaPad 5 30s we also have the huawei
mate book D 14 with horizon 5 2500 you
inside that's a 14-inch
slim and light design as well there so
some pretty compelling laptops from AMD
and their partners they're showing off
those rice and CPUs inside and be also
mentioned they have their
second-generation epic processes in the
labs right now for testing they've
decided to completely skip Zen Plus for
the epic line instead going straight to
Zen to on the 7 nanometer node should be
super interesting to see what they're
doing the service base with the seven
nanometer node and Zen - that should be
sampling in the second half of 2018
right on track for release in 2019 the
final things Amy had on show were things
that we have seen before however Amy
took the time to formally announce them
at Computex 2018 we have the power color
rx Vega 56 nano GPU which includes a
fully fledged Vega 56 inside but of
course it is a more compact card and if
you have a samsung q LED TV you will be
getting a free sync update very shortly
that will allow you to use free sync
with either a PC or either an Xbox one S
or Xbox one X so very cool that they're
expanding the free sync ecosystem into
TVs as well that's it for Amy's
announcements at Computex 2018 super
excited about second generation thread
Ripper and that 32 course 64 thread
processor will be very interesting to
see how that performs when we get our
hands on it in the coming months you
might even consider upgrading our video
editing workstations to that super
beastly CPU when we eventually get our
hands on it anyway big thanks to our
Computex 2018 sponsors MSI and Corsair
for helping bring us
to Taipei this year don't forget to
subscribe for the rest of our Computex
2018 coverage and I'll catch you in the
next one
