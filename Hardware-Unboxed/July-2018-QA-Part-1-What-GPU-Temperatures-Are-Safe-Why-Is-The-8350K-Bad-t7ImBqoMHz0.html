what we haven't done this month it is
time for the monthly Q&amp;amp;A we've asked you
guys what you would like us to address
we've got plenty of questions so let's
get into them
okay we'll kick things off with a
question that's probably a good place to
start and what recent two years or less
technologies do you think are or will be
a game-changer for pc hardware not
counting our RGB overlords of course
well I can't go with RGB then yeah I'm
fresh out of ideas and that one may be
3d TVs via but seriously I can't foresee
any game changes I suppose if I could
I'd probably worth more than I am in our
realm of GPU and CPU testing all that
kind of stuff I think seven nanometers
will be the next big step yeah well yeah
CPUs and GPUs that's the thing we're
most excited to see but sure that you
got nothing no not really can't see the
future either unfortunately TVs got
nothing for us either so we're useless
all right next question is a faster
gaming CPU necessary are we meant to
always stay under 144 Hertz by 144 Hertz
monitor anyway this if I've been asking
you to do this video for a long time I
think we get asked this pretty much
every Q&amp;amp;A as some form of question about
should you run a monitor with you know
frame rates above the refresh rate it's
a good question so don't get me wrong
it's just that I'm telling to address
this one is really about that one come
on but basically like we've said in the
past it is you get a more responsive
game experience if you run your frames
your frame rate that is above the
refresh rate of the moment so you don't
necessarily have to run 144 FPS or 144
hurts more if you're only 250 FPS it'll
be more responsive 500 FPS more
responsive again simply because it can
you know get the the frame that comes
out of the display will be the most
recent relative to your mouse inputs in
all that so yeah so games like Starcraft
2 not that important games like your
Call of Duty's battlefront battle
filled all those bit more important yeah
I think as well you asked is a faster
gaming CPU necessary well you know you
don't always necessarily need the
fastest gaming CPU in terms of you know
if you just want to play 60fps or
something but if you do want to hit
those high frame rates then there is a
benefit to getting a faster CPU that's
for sure yes that's right so I think I
put that in my is rising more future
proof for gamers and again if you're
using even like a GTX 1060 or a 1070
with competitive settings you will be
getting higher frame rates if the CPU
allows for it and as Tim said you're
important all that stuff's just a bit
better alright this is a good question
what browser do you guys use okay I did
use Mozilla Firefox for a long time so
yeah okay and then I got pulled over to
Chrome by a few mates that liked it so
much better and then once you started
you log in you save your bookmarks and
all your sort of accounts set up and all
that kind of stuff it just makes it
easier from going from one device to
another so yeah let's go with your phone
and your desktop and all that so I'm on
Chrome yeah I'm on Chrome as well pretty
much exactly the same reason I'm sure
I'm sure that you know if we look into
new browsers right now that all sorts of
browsers would have those sort of
features but just yet from back in the
day when those sort of features were
rare it was kind of kind of nice to have
so we just jumped in yeah I've heard
Firefox's awesome again yeah so just
we're kind of stuck in chrome now yes
yep I've been asked see if sharing files
over direct Ethernet connection assuming
one gigabit between two pcs would an
nvme SSD be worth it over a SATA SSD for
the best performance with the ethernet
connection bottleneck the nvme SSD too
much for it to be worth it
so Gigabit Ethernet it only equates to
125 megabytes per second and that could
be cut down even further by sort of
whatever is happening in the pipeline so
yeah for for the local storage transfers
it doesn't really matter you keep it
have a hard drive and not saturate 125
megabytes per second so as far as SSDs
are concerned solder is completely fine
and then nvme is kind of overkill I
guess unless you've got some 10 gigabit
networking or something masterrace
networking yeah you really do need that
sort of expensive set up to make the
most out of SSDs for file transfers
otherwise really anything's fine these
days yeah
SSD would be the way to go solder SSD
yeah just because that can do better
with random yeses rights and things like
that whereas most of the transfers
probably aren't that sequential anyway
so Steve what would you say is the most
reputable component reseller in
Australia PC case key is pretty good if
only they had a store in Sydney okay
well hmm we don't obviously buy a lot of
stuff we still do buy plenty of hardware
but not as much as you possibly might
imagine I don't know it depends on how
you view that fair anyway ah to be
perfectly honest we are PC case gear
fanboys just because they've been so
great to us the channel I even when the
channel was much smaller than it is even
now they were always happy to offer a
helping hand lend us whatever we needed
get whatever sort of stuff we needed and
sort of no questions asked there they
didn't ask for shoutouts or demand
anything it was just it just seemed
happy to help so yeah we we were
obviously really like those guys so we
highly recommend them they seemed like a
really nice company great people to work
with and so yeah no answer your question
though I think Sydney as well I don't
really
obviously not familiar with stores there
where for a Melbourne Victoria I think
you Mart is pretty good have you heard
much about you know I wouldn't know I
just usually buy most stuff from PC case
okay yeah well I've got a few stores in
New South Wales and I think their stuffs
relatively cheap I've got a cousin who
shops with them and he's had no
complaints so yeah maybe you Matt okay
we might draw it on a be a bit about
this one I'm not sure
Pablo asked our eBay's gpus worth buying
and I replied to him saying you mean ex
mining cards you mean the cheap Chinese
cards or do you mean just second-hand
GPUs in general and we didn't get a
response in time before shooting this
video so I guess we'll just quickly go
over those obviously the cheap Chinese
ones that are generic no brand don't
touch them because they're fake they're
just low-end cars that have had their
BIOS flash to identify as a higher-end
card so they're a complaint not a ripoff
I don't know why eBay isn't stamping out
the sellers that do that because they're
definitely not so avoid those stick to
your known brands you know sapphires msi
of Susa gigabyte whoever
as for ex mining cards I mean often
second-hand GPS aren't really advertised
as ex mining cars unless they're like in
a bundle of eight I don't really know
what advice I would give on those
because it really depends on how they
were used to mine whether they were
under vaulted and if they're in a cool
room or if they were heavily abused they
could be on the edge of dying I don't
have mad coil wine or something like
that would you agree yeah yeah I think
in a situation of buying used GPUs from
eBay you should probably just assume
most of them have been used for mining
even though at this point yeah even
though it doesn't it might not seem like
they're used for mining just go about
your practices with buying use GPS as if
it have been sort of tortured in that
way and then sort of look at what
options are available and yeah the
sellers are sort of saying so make sure
you're getting a good discount on it and
I think that that pretty much covers
just second-hand shopping in general I
suppose there's obvious pitfalls so
you've got to make sure you're getting
it I think I've said in the past I'd
always want at least a 40% discount over
what it costs to buy new that's at least
that much for your second I think people
often say about half price secondhand
you you're not gonna get a half price
ten atti
because obviously the demands still
there but just be careful with what
you're buying yeah that saying
definitely buying you stuff is worth it
if you know your budget is tight and
then you can definitely get lots of good
deals but again just got to be wary of
what's out there and how people have
used them yeah
okay next question how I decrease my GTX
ten at seventy TI fe cards that's the
founders edition model it hits eighty
degrees Celsius will eighty degrees
damage the GPU after three to four years
for the founders Edition cards the short
answer to that is no although many
people will tell you that that is hot
they sort of want to run at 70 degrees
or less which is what most of the my
partner cards do for the FE models
that's actually the temp target I should
I think 84 degrees maybe a temp target
on that one and so they are designed to
run at those temperatures so they're not
gonna die or it's doing that for years
on end it's not going to kill them or it
shouldn't I mean they're only hitting
those temperatures well your gaming
anyway so it's not going to look for the
entire life of the card but if you you
you could improve case that airflow to
reduce temperatures or at least stop it
from the fair
spitting up that's probably what you're
mostly going to be running into there is
the fam will spin up to keep it at 84
degrees because if you do exceed that it
will start a throttle it'll be lower in
the clock speeds of the cause so to
avoid that and get maximum performance
you want to keep it at under 84 degrees
so if you're achieving 80 degrees and
that's perfectly fine and you're at no
risk of damaging the card okay next
question
I like this nice short and to the point
is a gigabyte of RAM enough for gaming
we did a big in depth of video late last
year on this ensure is enough for gaming
for most titles you won't have any
problems there 16 gigabytes obviously
ideal at this point but for games like
your overwatch fortnight what other
examples can I give those sort of games
anyway the commonly played games that
are quite popular 8 gigabytes will be
fine a game such as what we got here
battlefield 1 and made a note of that
that's a game that definitely used 16
you've RAM no worries you'll get a bit
of stuttering with a gigabyte so I
imagine the upcoming battlefield 5 will
also require 16 gigabytes for a smooth
gameplay at all times so yeah thank you
byte is definitely what I would describe
as being the minimum would you agree
yeah with your laptop's 16 ideal and I
think over that's definitely overkill
through gigabytes definitely isn't
required for gaming there's no games to
take advantage of that much memory that
I'm aware of
you'll also have to dump less
information from the memory when loading
whatever it is you plan on playing if
you do use 16 opposed to eight that's
one advantage and then if you'd like to
alter mounted games check things like
that your computer will be a lot less
laggy when you do so but other than that
I don't think there's too many titles
that definitely need 16gb of RAM so it's
kind of I suppose a balancing act if
you've got a budget system and you don't
you know you've got sort of a quad-core
CPU and maybe up to a GTX 1060 then 8
gigabytes is going to be fine but if you
go for Rison 7 because it's got a lot of
cause there and you really want at least
16 gigabytes in my opinion so I hope
that makes sense alright another
question here and this is sort of about
YouTube so that's good for us
why does YouTube stutter with 4k 60fps
as it just Chrome what causes this so
probably let you answer that one if you
have any ideas yeah I imagine that you
run into
sort of a hardware issue there either
your CPU or whatever is not fast enough
to decode that I mean 4k 60fps footage
is quite intensive to decode without
sort of your special hardware and a lot
of CPUs at the moment don't have that
sort of dedicated decoding block for 4k
60 at least for the codecs and stuff
that YouTube uses so when you put your
quality settings all the way up to 4k 60
usually it's off loading on to the cpu
and if you cpu isn't fast enough you'll
run into all sorts of stutters and other
issues so I would imagine that's a
hardware issue for you unfortunately I
know for sure on my rise in seven system
that 4k 60p footage runs perfectly fine
I do ever tighten XP as well as that
probably helps out a bit there too but
yeah on the lower end systems
particularly laptops you can run into a
few issues with sort of 4k 60 on YouTube
all right here's an interesting question
do you think that AMD's 3rd gen
processors will be able to hit a 5
gigahertz overclock thanks to the 7
nanometer node if so will this make them
more viable against Intel considering
one of the main reasons Intel processors
are better at gaming is their higher
clock speeds so it's pretty interesting
to see what might be happening with the
7 animator load I know that Global
Foundries which manufactures AMD's cpus
their CEO or CTO I think said that
there's a lot they're making a lot of
performance claims at least with their
SEM nanometer process they were saying
you know at least a 2.7 times reduction
in size compared to 14 nanometer so
that's pretty big and you know usually
when you get that you get also you know
clock speed advantages and all sorts of
things that you can do there so they
have said that 5 gigahertz as possible
depending on the CPU design that's key
so whether they're referring to AMD
there or not we'll have to wait and see
but certainly 7 nanometers should be
allowing a lot more Headroom for that
sort of thing compared to 12 nanometer
that's currently being used so yeah and
I guess you know if AMD can push it up
to about 5 gigahertz then Intel with
their current tech they're in a bit of
trouble I think yeah the one thing that
they have on MB won't be there anymore
and I think they might be losing some
performance crayons
yeah exactly I totally agree with that
five-year Hertz would be yet amazing
very good I hope we're not getting
sucked for disappointment there I hope
it's not gonna fall if does fall short
it's not by a long way
is supposed to be a big improvement of a
current technology so you know your 14
nanometer to 12 nanometer which was
rising first gen 2 second gen wasn't
that big you saw that very small
improvement yes two point seven times
reduction in size yeah mass is over
large improvements in that so yeah we
should be seeing some pretty significant
gains with seven nanometer but as we've
always things that time to say so far
out but we should be you know when we
can so will Intel be soldiering their
ninth gen CPUs and it's soldiering in
Australia not soldering like they say in
America I just want to correct that for
the record
maybe soldering anything no ok I'll
answer that one I seriously doubt it and
I've seen the rumors heard all the
rumors I've had a good think about it I
think the rumors are probably like most
rumors they're BS it's certainly
possible so don't get us wrong we're not
saying it definitely won't happen but it
just seems unlikely that it would I mean
they don't even solder the 79 80 X e so
why would they solder the 9th gen
Desktop Parts I know they're under a lot
more pressure now and in my what Intel
needs to fix video one of my key things
asked them to fix was not using the
paste anymore and going to a solder
design but yeah I mean I'd be shocked if
they do it if they did it and it'd
probably be just for the eight core
models you know the eight core model or
other I can't see them they'll never
solder the lower-end chips because it
just doesn't make sense yep so maybe the
eight core the rest of them I'm saying
no chance but I think probably known all
of them you're great yep done okay we
have a question about affordability here
is building a PC going to get
significantly cheaper in the new future
at least RAM and GPUs gee that'd be nice
wouldn't that yeah I think it's probably
wishful thinking to say significantly
cheaper
I mean graphics cards are back in MSRP
pretty much the only way you use a video
just on that yep so graphics cards
aren't really any cheaper than they are
now I mean memory prices will help
they're a little bit ddr4 has plenty of
improvement flow improvement there's
just one component so well it will help
for the budget systems it's not gonna
make a big difference to your high-end
systems so I mean we have new GPUs they
should be arriving from Nvidia a few
months time then we have hopefully yeah
days later in the EO bill i said i don't
think it's going to change GPU pricing
too much we'll just get better GPUs for
hopefully hopefully the same money yeah
and also I think the same thing would
happen with memory as well with DVR five
that will be coming out in a couple of
years I would imagine I think I'm pretty
pessimistic about all this pricing stuff
so I think ddr4 has a chance of staying
the same price until ddr5 comes out oh
and then you'll just be upgrading to
that a lot of people say that I
obviously have no idea and we're just
guessing but if you look at the the
history of memory pricing it's very yeah
that's it goes in cycles and we should
be coming at the start of next year 2019
we should be coming in the downwards so
hopefully hopefully so I said in my
Wyatt's a bad time for PC gamers to
build computers or whatever it was that
serious legend at the start of the year
can't be expected to remember what the
series was called I said in that series
I expect ddr4 pricing to fall early next
year so time will tell alright Steve
here's a question I know you love
getting I don't understand why you think
the 8350 case sucks it seems like a
relatively good choice for a budget
Riggs since there are cheaper
motherboard solutions could you explain
why a 350 K isn't good
by the way it's coming in the mail for
me well firstly my condolences okay so
this is all coming about because I named
the core i3 350 K as one of the worst
CPUs in my top 5 worst CPUs video not
that long ago in my opinion the CPU just
makes a little sense no sense at all and
it's current asking price and I say that
because for I believe it's the exact
same price right now you can get the
core i5 8400 and that's just a
significantly better CP on my opinion
but I'll get to that in a minute and
even worse you can get the Rison 5 2600
I believe that's currently $10 u.s.
cheaper so that's three times the
threads for $10 less and it's actually
more than a $10 saving you've got a
factor in the fact that the a350 k it's
just a core i3 processor it doesn't come
with a cooler whereas you do get a good
cooler I know people
hammer about the rates still noting a
great cooler but it's significantly
better than no cooler and it does lay in
at run the Rison v 2600 up to
I think about four gigahertz yet by
memory from memory you might also say
well the 8350 K can be overclocked to
five units maybe even 5.2 gigahertz and
for gaming that makes it you know a
better CPU there something like the rise
in five 2600 just on the night of
overclocking now all the 8350 case that
I've tried to overclock completely
sucked they topped out at 4.8 to 4.9 you
know it's even my sample actually I
didn't get a sample I bought mine but
the first chip I bought only did 4.9 so
that was a disappointment after all my
other coffee like CPUs did at least five
gigahertz and a little bit of research
from Silicon Lottery will tell you that
half of them only only half of the
manage 5 gigahertz and I think it's
something like 14% of them reach 5.2 so
they're obviously not Bend as well as
the core i5 and the i7 models and even
at 5.20 Hertz it's still slower than a
core i5 8400 for core heavy workloads
and that's non-gaming workloads of
course but then even for gaming it'll
still like a core i5 8500 or still a
two-hit 600 FPS or whatever it is in
csgo so overclocking a quad core doesn't
really help there and for games like
Battlefield 1 you will be right on the
edge of a stuttering hell with the 83
50k at five point two goats or five
units or whatever so that CPU next year
is just really gonna struggle with
triple-a titles and then talking about
5.2 you had to be playing overclocking a
5.2 years you obviously need a cooler to
match and it is a hot chip at 5.2 yet so
you've got to spend something like $50
on a decent air cooler or more if you
want an all-in-one liquid cooler so in
short if you plan on overclocking get
the rise in v 2600 because there's just
a much faster much better cpu and it
actually works out being cheaper at the
end of the day so if you're on a tight
budget my advice would be get the Rison
320 200 G or the core i3 8100 so
hopefully all that gives you some
understanding of why I think daddy 350k
sucks so is there any hope at all the
game developers will move towards more
core utilization in the near future will
there be a rise in sponsored tile
showing off multi-core power ashes of
the benchmark for life ok well it's a
bit of a tricky one this one for
multiple reasons we're certainly moving
towards utilising these core heavy CPUs
better
and I sort of touched on this in my what
is it is rise and more future-proof for
gamers video that I did not that long
ago it's probably only been a week each
area now basically that video I said
it's not going to happen tomorrow it's
not going up in next week or next month
or even next year it's likely going to
be quite a few years before we see games
really pushing arise in seven CP to its
limits and probably quite a few years
before we see even the six core 12 ever
isin five CP is being heavily utilized
in games I'll try to summarize this one
and quickly I'll just get to the point
because there's a few different aspects
this like it's not just about spreading
load across all the cores which ashes
does do a great job of doing you've
actually then got to be fully utilizing
all those cores and well we do have
quite a few games that will spread the
load pretty well almost as well as ashes
you're not saturating something like a
rise in seven CPU it's like twenty to
forty percent so until we can get that
up to probably 90% that's when you're
really going to see the the older CPUs
with less cause just really struggling
not being able to keep up in those
titles okay we're going to hit pause
there plenty of questions answered
hopefully successfully to their
satisfaction and then tomorrow we'll
have part two if Tim gets that edited so
he's tasked with that job anyway thank
you for watching like subscribe share
that's still a thing isn't it and we'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
