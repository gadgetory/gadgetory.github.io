video a big thank you to our sponsors
for supporting this year's Computex
coverage check out course has fancy new
vengeance RGB memory and if you're after
a new rig that won't send you broke
MSI's got you covered
check out the latest msi gaming pc
setups and learn how you can build an
incredible new gaming rig that's light
on your wallet make sure you check out
the link below in the video description
welcome back to how we run box Tim and
myself are now entire one hopefully this
will be the first of many Computex
related videos sure hasn't officially
started yet today's Monday but we did
just spend an hour and a half at the
Nvidia press event
yeah they spent a lot of time speaking
about their deep learning staff their AI
technologies a lot of their hardware
platforms related to that but Steve I
think the most disappointing thing for
our viewers is that they they didn't
announce any new GeForce consumer
graphics cards so and they were asked a
few times they are us and they said
that'll be a party for a future date
they didn't say when that future date
will be or give any hints at all so
unfortunately no GeForce news at all
nothing about the new GPUs coming up so
we're still expecting them and about
probably about two months time yeah well
we saw recently there was that news
story that appeared about the hot chips
conference is happening on August 20th
there was sort of a schedule released
for that and there was a particular
event there that was going to be Nvidia
detailing the next mainstream GPU they
have since removed that listing from the
hot chips sort of event listing so that
kind of indicates to us that and video
will at least be willing to talk about
their next-generation GPUs in August but
certainly today they were very keen on
avoiding talking about GPUs and instead
talking about all their their drive
compute their AI their deep learning and
yeah certainly certainly disappointing
for those guys out there who will still
have to wait a couple of months
potentially maybe July when they will
start announcing that sauce that sort of
thing we should mention that Jensen was
asked quite a few times when the
next-generation GPUs will arrive he did
at one point say a long time from now
but we think that was an exaggeration on
his behalf to try and stop the media
asking the question over and over again
at least we hope that's the
anyway so considering that nvidia hasn't
announced anything officially and they
did sound like it was going to happen
later in the we're not expecting to hit
the showroom floor in the morning and
see their partners like msi or soos have
any kind of cards or even hints of new
cards coming out yeah it seems like the
the leaks and stuff for suggesting that
Nvidia will be releasing her founders
additional at least launching and
announcing her founders edition card
first currently that we don't really
like to speculate about this sort of
thing but it does sound like July maybe
with founders Edition cards then and
then partner cards later but that's
obviously still a couple of months away
so that explains why when we hit the
show fall tomorrow we're not going to
see those partner cards very unlikely
that's right
so I do have one question for you Steve
if we're not seeing you know new
next-generation cards from Nvidia at the
show are we going to be seeing anything
interesting in the sort of graphics card
space from Nvidia at Computex this year
well with no new GPUs announced I
seriously doubt we're going to see any
Pascal cards it's just true late in the
product cycles so there won't be any new
1080 tea eyes or anything like that or
1070 tea eyes so I don't think there'll
be any new GPUs at all or graphics cards
rather and I don't think they'll be
anything on AMD side either at least for
Vega 56 and 64 yeah at least for their
consumer lines that's right I think a
lot of the stuff and video is telling us
before the event was sort of more
focused on their their g-sync HDR
monitors which are just starting to hit
the market this month I think and they
did spend a bit of the press conference
talking about max q laptops as well
being one of their key focuses but as we
keep saying in this video a number of
times now definitely the new graphics
cards is not something that we're going
to be seeing unfortunately one of the
other things that were shown at this
sort of press event was in videos ray
tracing technology now that isn't a new
technology something that they have
shown previously but it still remains
quite a way away for games and sort of
you know consumer focused cards the
simulations that they were running we're
on I think it was four very $170,000
system if you guys want to take
advantage of that there's no games but
yeah and the city over in video is
definitely talking about it was in fact
asked a question about when
RTX would be coming to those sort of
single card consumer cards and it's
definitely was reader rating that that's
still a long time away just shove that
sort of high-end $70,000 technology into
a single GPU not it's not going to be
next-generation it's probably not going
to be the generation after it's a cool
technology to show off and it looks
impressive but don't expect to see at
new games anytime soon
yeah so the one thing that Nvidia did
announced at their press conference was
the Jetson Xavier sort of robotics chip
that you would put into robotics devices
in the future they announced a dev kit
for that that will cost 1,300 us early
access for that is in August apparently
it's the largest project in Nvidia
history it's designed for all sorts of
you know automated intelligence
you know robots that sort of things sort
of a neat little chip that you can put
in an unusal of invidious deep learning
libraries for that apparently it has
eight arm cause in it it runs at about
30 watts of power and it's equivalent to
at least in in videos words a ten
thousand dollar workstation for those
sort of applications so it's pretty cool
but it's definitely not the sort of
thing that would be up a lot of the
people out there early in terms of
consumer graphics or anything like that
definitely more for the developers but
still nonetheless a bit cool so not
super exciting news to kick start the
show with we were hoping to tell you
guys about some new GPUs but it is what
it is
yeah tomorrow though we will be hitting
the showroom floor as the show
officially starts Computex 2018 and we
have a few great meetings lined up and
we do have some new products to show you
guys that will be in tomorrow's video
all right so thanks to everyone for
watching a little update on nvidia at
Computex 2018 don't forget to like this
video and subscribe to watch the rest of
our Computex coverage as we get through
that in the next couple of days I guess
we will catch you next time
what's your head yeah don't get you
Steve
so Steve did you hit your head on these
things are used in you to talk this
yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
