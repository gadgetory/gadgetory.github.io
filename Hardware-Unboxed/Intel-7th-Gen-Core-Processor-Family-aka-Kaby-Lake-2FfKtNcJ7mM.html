Intel 7th generation Core processors
code-named KB Lake are far away built on
the 14 nanometer design process cable a
could be the success of the sky leg
initially Schaick was to be succeeded by
the 10 nanometer cannon Lake
Architecture however way back in July
2015 Intel announced that cannon Lake
will be delayed until the second half of
2017 now in the third quarter of 2016
many enthusiasts are hotly anticipating
the arrival of cable a well today Intel
is officially announcing the release of
their seventh generation Core processors
though not the desktop parts many of you
will be interested in rather today marks
the arrival of the mobile processor from
the U ultra-low power and why extremely
low power series these processors
feature a TDP ranging from 4.5 watts up
to 15 watts and are intended to power
twin ones and ultra thin notebooks
unfortunately the enthusiast grade
desktop and notebook processors that I
and probably most of you were interested
in won't be arriving until next year
entails officially stated a January 2017
release for their more serious seventh
gen Core processors another five-month
way probably isn't what you wanted to
hear and this means cable aches should
be arriving around the same time as
AMD's hugely anticipated Xen processors
exciting times ahead indeed for now we
have the low powered cable like
processes to give us some insight into
the kind of improvements Intel has made
to their latest microarchitecture the
headline here being the Intel is
claiming a 12% performance increase over
skylake in fact Intel says the core i7
7500 you will be up to 12 percent faster
than the i-765 hundred you for
productivity tasks based on performance
seen when testing with sis Marc 2014
though I should point out that there is
up to a 13 percent difference in
operating frequency between these two
processes in favor of the 7500 you so
you have to wonder how much difference
the updated architecture makes you
comparing the same processes Intel says
the i7 7500 you will be up to 19% faster
for web-based applications these claims
are based on web XP RT 2015 performance
and again with up to a 13% clock speed
advantage we wondered just how much
faster the seventh gen processor really
is
Intel also claims there'll be
significant productivity and
responsiveness gains over the six gen
processor
they even go as far to say KB Lake is
built using the 14 nanometer plus
process although they didn't say exactly
what the changes are they claimed that
the 40 nanometer process used 4 KB Lake
is so well refined that when compared to
the 14 nanometer process for sky lake it
warrants the plus the focus for these
low-power chips has been on improving 4k
video playback along with 360-degree
videos and multiple video stream
performance included as a new media
engine built upon the gen 9 graphics
architecture there's also support for a
new HEV C 10 bit decode capability this
should enable smooth premium playback
for 4k content likewise the new vp9
decotape abilities should provide power
efficient smooth 4k 360-degree playback
while multitasking the improved power
efficiency means that ultra portable
devices can run for up to nine and a
half hours playing 4k content before
sucking the battery dry as far as the
product lineup and availability goes you
should start seeing devices featuring
core m3 and core i3 Core i5 and core i7
seventh gen processors Intel expects the
OEM partners to start shipping seventh
gen enabled systems to users by early
September so what are the processes you
can expect to see from the Y series
there are three new processes the cry 7
7 y 7 5 Core i5 7 y5 4 and Core m37 y3o
all three of dual core processors with
hyper-threading 4 4 threads the key
difference being the operating frequency
the i7 7 y7 5 features a base clock of
1.3 gigahertz with a maximum single core
frequency of 3.6 gigahertz the i5 7 y5 4
can crank up to 3.2 gigahertz and the m3
is 7 y3o just 2.6 gigahertz
then there's the u series which sports
the core i7 7500 u core i5 7200 u and
core i3 7100 you again these are all
dual core processors boasting 4 threads
the only noteworthy differences are the
frequencies though I should know Intel
doesn't list the capacity with the
various cases the i3 is 7100 u is locked
at 2.4 gigahertz while the i5 7200 you
can run as fast as 3.1 gigahertz the i7
7500 you up to 3.5 gigahertz Intel
suggests a price of 281 for the core i5
core i3 and core m3 processes while the
core i7 models cost 393 us both the Y
Series and new series processors have
integrate
platform input and output the Y Series
and premium u series processes support
three independent displays raid and
hcit's support Intel Smart Response
technology a high definition audio smart
sound technology up to six USB 3 ports
and four SATA 6 gigabits per second
ports the baseline u series processors
drop raid support Intel Smart Response
technology they support just 4 USB 3
ports and two-sided 6 cubed per second
ports overall it's a really interesting
lineup from Intel and I'm keen to see
just how well devices sporting these
seventh-generation core processors
perform what do you guys think of this
