have a very exciting video for you
because today we are getting our first
look at AMD's second generation rise in
threader PCBs along with official
pricing and release date info before all
that this video has been sponsored by
deep cool deep cools newcastle all in
one liquid cooler provides performance
to match its unique looks the water
blocks large cover base offers full tear
for coverage for amy's massive thread
ripper cpus and as we found out recently
it's more than capable of tackling the
rise in seven twenty seven hundred and
yet despite all this deep cooler
offering the 240 millimeter version at
an MSRP of just 110 dollars u.s. okay so
let's get down to business before we get
to the exciting unboxing portion in the
video let's just go over some official
information and the stuff that were
allowed to release at this point in time
without beating around the bush there
will be four second-generation thread
rep receiver use the most expensive
which will be the $1,800 u.s. WX series
TR twenty nine ninety WX and that is a
32 or 64 thread beast that AMD says is
designed for creators and innovators the
32 cores will operate a base frequency
of three gigahertz with a boost
frequency of 4.2 gigahertz for now
that's all the clock speed info we have
so yet can't release any more of that
until the review also in the WX series
we have the 29 70 X for $1,300 us and
that one packs 24 cores and 48 threads
and we'll have these same operating
frequencies as bigger brother then as
part of the X series we have the 29 50 X
and like the 1950 X it's a 16 core
32 thread part and it will become
available at $900 u.s. so $100 u.s. or
less than what we got the 1950 x4 and
that one will pack at 4.4 gigahertz
boost frequency with a 3.5 gigahertz
base then finally we have the baby of
the family the measly 12 core 24 thread
CPU knows the 29 20 X but just $650 us
it's pretty incredible what AMD is done
when we consider that a 12 core CPU is
the low-end base model but it is the
situation we're currently faced with and
it means that for that price from Intel
you're getting I think it's the core i7
78 20x and that's just an 8 core CPU so
certainly some progress has been made
the 29:20 x will operate at 3.5
gigahertz for the base and it will boost
as high as four point three gigahertz
as for availability well you can
pre-order the flagship part the twenty
nine ninety WX today but as always we
would urge you not to aim DS gonna hate
us for saying that because that's kind
of the point of these staggered
announcements as to create hype and
generate sales in the form of pre-orders
but as always I'm going to suggest that
you wait for our review and the review
of other media outlets before parting
with your money although you can
pre-order now the twenty nine ninety WX
won't be available to August 13th so
whether you preorder now or just wait a
week and buy it then you pretty much
gonna get you your grubby mitts on it at
the same time I doubt they're going to
sell out and it'll be months before you
can get one very unlikely that then on
the 31st of August the 29th 50 X will be
available and the release of the 24 core
and 12 core models won't happen till
sometime in October AMD says okay with
all that important information out of
the way I think it's time to have a bit
of fun and see what AMD has sent us I
gave our patron members a bit of a tease
and showed them these two boxes a few
days ago I've had these sitting in the
studio for about a week now almost a
week and I have been dying to unbox them
but I swear I haven't even had a peek
AMD's given me a bit of a hint at what's
in here we've got some motherboards some
memory and light sort of stuff and of
course the new second-generation thread
Ripper CPUs why am i delaying this let's
just get into it actually I'm going to
start with the other box because I think
I think that is some extra stuff I think
the smaller box has the actual thread
Ripper kit in it anyway we'll find out
certainly very heavy so I'm pretty sure
this box here has a thread Ripper review
kit well uh well know in a moment okay
it looks like it's bubble wrap so
probably not the most exciting yep I
kind of get that out all right well I'm
tipping out very nice-looking very
special indeed it's a it's thread Ripper
massive the packaging so looks like we
lifted this up yeah it's coming it's
kind of coming I don't know Oh yep I did
that right okay that's time
alright here we go I think this is the
final unveiling wow it looks mighty
impressive from the back here is that
seriously brushed aluminium well I just
got my grubby fingerprints on it so I'd
say it is okay that looks pretty special
we've got a couple of memory modules
there some more stuff under this foam
look like box here and then it's just
foam is left in the bottom there so
we'll put that down out of the way for a
moment we'll have a look at this first
cuz so we've got two sheets of brushed
aluminium on the front here and it looks
like we pull these tabs possibly
it's got arrows suggesting that they
come out okay I managed to get one off
that didn't come without a bit of a
fight okay I got the other one I think
we're in business now so perhaps this
lifts off you're gonna see what is
behind here before I do so there we go
what are we looking at
ooh the official thread river packaging
well that looks pretty fancy and in
there we do have the twenty nine ninety
WX processor pretty awesome we pop this
can we get it out we can indeed get it
out it just lifts out so we'll put this
down this way and we're trying to
wriggle it out okay we did it a few all
righty well I'll move that frame I went
and got my magic wand how does that look
does that look good I'll stream it looks
pretty cool anyway not for that okay I
suppose the goal here is to open this
while doing the lease term have damage
possible where did I put my knife here
it is I've got it you can all stop
looking okay there is a pull here or rip
here so I suppose we'll do it looks like
it'll tear that I will just do it the
way you meant to do it okay so we have a
little tab on top I am going okay you
push that I was thought you might pull
it but it just pushes forward and it
looks like that lifts up the like of
that it's very difficult to do this
while showing the camera and do we just
reach in and grab that out is that how
this works that is indeed how that works
so that's kind of cool it's very you
guys will remember the last packaging
where you could turn the thing and you
had the circular thing well now it's a
rectangular thing pretty cool in the
bottom here we no doubt have our tools
and whatnot to install the CPU I'll try
and get yep there we go so that comes
out okay so the rest that's just empty
packaging now we have this little box
here and this will no doubt have a
torque screw in it or Torx driver so we
got that little guy and they have this
little bracket here that supports a lot
of the water box and then you get a nice
at all
or it's actually quite large rise and
thread ripper sticker it's got the old
through a ripper design on it but that's
why actually most of the packaging does
so I'm not actually sure if they're
going with the you have you seen the new
thread Ripper Tim got a t-shirt with it
anyway so yeah that's what's in there we
have the CPU packaging is now empty
should always put all this away quickly
so we have the CPU here I'll probably
will definitely include some b-roll of
it but yeah similar sort of looking deal
to last time very similar in fact I will
take it out of the little orange caddy I
realize you need that to install it but
I'm gonna take it out because it looks
like garbage and my biro looks a lot
better with the CPU taken out of it so
for anyone who's going to get triggered
that I've taken it out of there I
suggest you don't take it out of this if
you're buying it to put it in your own
system and be very careful with it
because it is very much required but for
b-roll to shop on my youtube channel I
would like to take it out so hope we're
clear on that one okay let's see what's
in this box because that was a very
large package just for a CPU it is a
very large CPU so there is that ah
excellent I know what this is already
I've seen that and this is the Wraith
rip up if I can get it out and this is
an equally large intercooler to go with
the equally massive CPU so for those of
you who aren't familiar with this
gigantic air cooler I it's not going to
be included with the thread Ripper CPUs
by default so it's not a box cooler
though it's kind of like the official
air cooler for thread reprice babies
it's made in collaboration with
coolermaster who often makes the coolers
for AMD and i'm glad i didn't touch the
bottom there because that is a
pre-applied Tim and yep it's sticky as
you would expect so now I'll try not to
destroy that because I would like to
test the standard Tim on it at least
once so anyway that is the Wraith Ripper
cooler and it is
absolutely massive anodized black big
huge copper base heaps of copper pipes
and I'm really keen to see how well that
works on the twenty nine ninety WX and
how far you can overclock it with this
massive air cooler yeah very heavy it
has some nice RGB effects on the top
these sort of clear strip see these
translucent strips they light up and
provide some cool effects so I'll
probably provide some b-roll of this in
action for this video just so you get a
good idea if you missed Computex
coverage I'm gonna sit that guy right
there
then finally AMD has also provided two
of the g.skill flare X memory kits and
we've used these before with Rhys and
they work extremely well this is the
ddr4 3200 sale 14 stuff they are eight
gigabyte sticks so we have 32 gigabytes
in total so that's gonna be knife that's
what I'm currently running in my 1950 X
system I've got the Trident Z stuff but
it's 3,200 cell 14 very very similar
okay well that's box one down and that
was very exciting indeed I want to just
go benchmark right now but to do that
well I don't need new motherboards but I
would like some new motherboards
designed with the 32 core thread Ripper
CPU in mind I think we have at least one
board designed with that CPU in mind so
let's have a look quite a lot of stuff
in this box I'm actually gonna put it on
the ground and I'll lift it all out
because it's very heavy
so we have the nm axe lick tech to is it
the true one is it the 240 I have the
280 in my system a few people have said
that they had problems with the 240
model my 280 has been absolutely
brilliant I love it I've been using it
for almost a year now keeps my 1950 eggs
very cool that's quiet so hopefully no
issues with this one but I'll give it a
go a few guys few patreon members said
they've had problems with the 240 model
so yeah not sure what's going on with
that but anyway I'll give that a go and
hopefully it's as good as my 280
then we have the ROG zennith extreme
cooling kit and I believe these are
active coolers for the zenith extreme
motherboard which would make sense
because we have that motherboard again
and I'll just put that box there quick
look ok so you've got like what looks to
be a 40 millimeter fan and that will
clip onto the vrm heat sinks and provide
a bit of extra active cooling another
one of those so yeah I'll give that a go
and I'll report back on what sort of
thermal numbers I see or thermal
performance the motherboard that I am
most interested in is this one again we
saw this for the first time at Computex
and they've left Meg in the name so
that's a little bit upsetting so it is
the msi meg x3 99 creation x3 19
creation in my opinion would have been
significantly better but whatever
we've got Meg now hey the name itself
isn't super important and it doesn't
have gaming in the name so that's a huge
improvement anyways not there
the x3 99 mega gaming or something like
that because while these motherboards or
the CPUs they're not designed for gamers
they're designed for workstations
productivity creators so creation makes
a lot more sense than gaming that's for
sure extremely heavy inaudible with this
one I won't rattle off all respects this
we sort of did that in a Computex
coverage and I will cover it again in
detail in a future video but it just has
a whopping great veeram and this thing
should have no problem overclocking the
32 core third or per CPU to the max and
I think anyway it's a fantastic looking
motherboard I know there were opinions
varied on our copy text coverage the
sort of smashed glass kind of theme I
thought was really cool some of you did
some of you didn't that's usually half
how these things go but anyway I think
you can all agree that it's a pretty
epic x3 no no motherboard in any case
and then finally the last thing in our
box here is another
Rison CPU and it is the 2950 X so that
is the 16 coil model so we have the 16
and 32 core models to try out though you
could probably simulate the 24 core
model and even the 12 core model with
the 32 core processor so maybe that is
something that I'll do for our day-long
coverage let me know if you guys are
interested in seeing just a little bit
of testing with 24 and 12 cores enabled
if that's an option via the motherboards
using a Down core feature it should be
anyway i'll all look into that but I
think we need to go and unbox this again
because you've seen the process once and
I think we need to do it twice but we do
have the 32 core and 16 core CPUs ready
for our day 1 coverage which will be in
a week's time so I think that is going
to do it for this episode of unboxing
second generation thread Ripper hope you
guys enjoyed it plenty of benchmarking
for me to do now I want to provide a
usual in-depth coverage it'll be at
least a 20-minute video covering a lot
of stuff and then there'll be multiple
videos following up probably looking at
the motherboards in depth vrm sort of
temperatures overclocking will cover a
little bit up in the day-long coverage
but we'll do some more advanced
overclocking down the track we'll look
at memory and all that sort of stuff and
yeah it should be a lot of fun they will
also do some air cooler testing some
liquid cooler testing there is going to
be boatloads of work for me to do so I'm
looking at very forward to that oh and I
could also do a build video probably the
day before we actually released the
benchmark so I could put the the Meg in
a cool-looking case so if that's
something you guys want to see let me
know about that in the comment section
below and I can make a build happen but
yeah I think that is going to do it for
this one hope you guys enjoyed the video
your excited about the information on
pricing and availability but don't wait
till you see our review and the reviews
of others before you order because
that's just a wiser approach but yeah
thanks for watching I'm your host Steve
and I'll see you again next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
