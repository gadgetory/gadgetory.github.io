episode of what does it take to play
where I take a PC game and work out
which combination of hardware offers
gamers the best bang for their buck this
time around I am checking out player
unknowns battlegrounds and this is a
title a lot of you have heavily
requested for the past few weeks now
also yes I am still sick I was really
hoping to have recovered by now but what
can you do anyway rather than go the
rest of the week without a video I've
loaded up on Cod rules and hopefully I
make it to the end of this video
technically the game isn't officially
released yet but you can pay $30 u.s. to
basically become a beta tester for the
developer the early access became
available in the 24th of March 2017 and
a shipload of gamers have taken them up
on the offer to try the game out by mid
April 2017 the game had already sold
over 1 million copies and Steam reported
a peak concurrent play account of 89
thousand the game's estimated to have
exceeded 34 million dollars u.s. in
sales for April making it one of the top
10 highest-grossing revenue games for
the month exceeding the likes of
overwatch and Counter Strike global
Offensive for example last month the
game exceeded 2 million copies sold and
has now grossed over 60 million dollars
so why is battle grounds so popular
basically I think it boils down to the
game's fast-paced nature firstly getting
into a game is extremely quick despite
featuring up to 100 players games
generally take less than a minute to
find and even if you die quickly getting
into another game won't take that long
once you are in a game the action is
generally quite fast paced thanks to the
continual shrinkage of the safe zone
which herds players closer and closer
together anyway there's a lot more to
the game but I won't touch on that here
instead I'm going to focus on the
hardware required for optimal gameplay
at sandy P as you might expect
battlegrounds isn't particularly well
optimised right now
and the game's Polish leaves a lot to be
desired so pretty typical stuff there
for an early access title still the game
is a heap of fun
and there seems to be quite a few of you
wanting to know what kind of hardware
you need in order to enjoy the game
using reasonably high quality settings
so over the past week I've been messing
around with a few CPU and GPU
combinations to try and work out which
delivers players the best bang for their
buck right now in video GPUs appear to
have a rather large performance
advantage in this title over their radio
and competition that said AMD's rise in
CPUs are performing very well and I
found the horizon 7 1800 X to be roughly
on par with a core i7 7700 K when
testing CPU performance there I found
something rather unexpected with the
7700 K there always seemed to be one
thread that was heavily taxed meanwhile
core distribution when using a rise in
CPU was much more even
this allowed the rise in v 1400 to
deliver very smooth performance really
did CPU utilization exceed 40% for
rendering around 60 to 80 FPS at 1080p
using the high quality preset I found
the geforce gtx 1066 gigabyte was the
way to go the RX 580 on the other hand
would at times drop as low as 40 FPS
under the same conditions
AMD could very well be waiting for the
game to be released before they invest
too much time and driver development
that said though given the game's
popularity it might make sense to start
optimizing now for testing i have mostly
stuck with the high quality preset as it
offers the best balance of visual
quality and performance in my opinion
and here's a quick look at how the
various presets compare using the gtx
1060 at 1080p as you can see there's a
decent 30 percent performance increase
in framerate when going from ultra to
high and most crucially this saw the
average frame rate hovering around 60
FPS downgrading from high to medium only
boosted performance by 13% and in my
opinion the difference in visual quality
was quite noticeable then as we move to
low the frame rate does skyrocket but in
my opinion the game looks pretty awful
that said though with less vegetation
and distractions I can see why more
serious gamers use the lower quality
settings so moving forward I will be
showing 1080p footage using the high and
ultra quality presets what's the other
isin 514 hundred and gtx 1060 yet on
play unknowns battlegrounds is a heap of
fun but at the same time it feels like
being a long way from a finished product
the early access have seen a number of
updates already but still even so I fear
will be quite some time before the games
anywhere new Polish enough to exit the
early access stage even so most gamers
seem happy with what they're seeing so
far based on the Steam reviews so
hopefully developer will keep moving
forward at a satisfactory rate for now
being a better access tester can be
frustrating especially for those trying
to learn the game I found quite a few
times I just couldn't kill some people
even when I came across someone afk it
was quite challenging probably shouldn't
admit that here's one example I'm
speaking of for a relatively close
distance I take a shot at a stationary
target who's clearly not wearing any
armor the first round 5 looked like a
solid headshot density animation
suggested otherwise two more rounds
seemed to be on target but how they
missed I get it I'm not that good so I
advanced within spitting distance and
fired off two more rounds both in my
opinion probably should have hit that
neither did so I gave up on headshots
and move to execution distance standing
for center mass shots two more rounds
and I've got the job done and my second
kill in the bag not sure I should count
that one but anyway I was quite
desperate so I did and moved on
anyway if you can deal with the
frustration of often missing what looks
to be a sure kill only to be denied by
shotgun from like a hundred metres away
then battlegrounds will provide hours of
fun sadly I just don't have time to act
as a paid beta tester so revisit the
title once it's finished I'm your host
Steve see again next time you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
