we've got our first look at am reason
Raven Ridge desktop AP uses a m-- D
release the risin 5 2400 G and rise in
322 energy and both were very impressive
despite a grueling 4 day grind doing
nothing but working on our coverage
there's still loads of things that I'd
like to cover in much more detail such
as overclocking and of course just
testing more games since publishing our
review there's been a heap of questions
asked about these new Raven Ridge ap
used but the one I've been spotting
probably the most frequently has to do
with memory allocation for the Vega GPU
now unlike a typical discrete graphics
card like the Vegas 64 model that I have
here most integrated solutions don't
have their own dedicated memory so if we
take this Vegas 64 graphics card as an
example it has 8 gigabytes of dedicated
memory so an inking about memory buffer
just for the GPU where it can store data
and then access it quickly when it needs
to because this is a high-end graphics
card it not only has a rather large a
gigabyte buffer but the bus it uses to
access the memory is very fast
HBM to provides a 2048 bit wide memory
bus and with the memory clocked at 1.2 5
gigahertz this allows for a bandwidth of
483 gigabytes per second further down
the food chain like at the bottom you'll
find graphics cards such as the rx 550
because the compute performance is
around 9 times lower it doesn't require
an 8 gigabyte memory buffer either in
fact the rx 550 would be flat-out taking
advantage of half that capacity and in
today's games really works just as well
with a 2 gigabyte buffer regardless of
capacity though it uses memory clocked
at 1.75 here you hertz and with a
128-bit wide bus can be fed down at 112
gigabytes per second so a typical rx 550
has a 2 gigabyte memory buffer and that
allows it to shift data in and out of
the memory at a theoretical peak
bandwidth of 112 gigabytes per second
now if the game requires 3 gigabytes of
vram but you only have two year bytes
some game assets then spill over into
the system memory this is often referred
to as Ram I covered this in a bit more
detail in a video earlier this year that
investigated how much RAM gamers need
basically shifting data in and out of
memory is significantly slowed up the
Raven Ridge GPUs for example a limited
to a memory bound with them around 35
gigabytes per second that's for a system
equipped with dual channel ddr3 200
memory so in the case of the rx 550 when
accessing data locally using the onboard
via Ram it has a bandwidth of 112
gigabytes per second or a theoretical
peak bandwidth but when accessing from
the system memory it's limited to around
35 gigabytes per second so it takes at
least three times longer to process the
same amount of data we're moving through
the system memory however if your
computer then runs out of system memory
game assets a move to the local storage
device this means your hard drive or
hopefully an SSD and depending on how
fast that devices and how heavily its it
with data it's at this point that you'll
very likely see a noticeable dip in
framerate as the bandwidth is now
reduced to around 500 megabytes per
second with an SSD if you're lucky
keeping all that information in the back
of the old noggin the Vega GPU
integrated into the Raven Ridge apu has
no local memory to speak of now some
integrated GPU is like the Vega M
graphics that'll be found in the new
Intel KB Lake G processors they do have
their own dedicated memory and this
greatly enhances performance but it also
greatly increases the cost as well since
AMD's Raven Ridge ap user budget
solutions it wasn't going to be possible
to include HBM to memory and it simply
doesn't make sense at this point in time
so with no dedicated vram they use
system memory exclusively and this means
they are restricted to our bandwidth of
around 35 gigabytes per second with the
system using dual channel ddr3 200
memory of course bandwidth is just part
of the issue here memory capacity also
plays a key role a system with a base
model rx 550 graphics card for example
in a gigabytes of ddr4 memory
effectively has 10 gigabytes of total
memory to play with but when using vega
8 or 11 graphics on a raven or GPU you
now just have 8 gigabytes of memory to
share between the CPU and GPU
generally speaking we notice does a very
good job of managing memory and
prioritizing applications for best
results that said at least some portion
of your system memory will be
partitioned and allocated to the
integrated graphics the Raven Ridge ap
used for example use a method called
unified memory architecture or luma for
short
right now most am for motherboards let
you set them
resize somewhere between 64 megabytes
and 2 gigabytes depending on the size
you select will determine the amount of
system memory that is allocated
exclusively to the vago graphics that is
to say once allocated it can only be
used as a graphics memory and therefore
can no longer be accessible by the
operating system or the applications
that run on it now this is where I'm
seeing a bit of confusion and
misinformation some people are claiming
that for best results reviewers need to
test with the frame buffer set to the
maximum possible size and right now
that's 2 gigabytes however this isn't
necessarily true and in fact most of you
watching this video who have built or
plan on building their own Raven rich
system will want to do the complete
opposite you're actually far better off
selecting the absolute minimum amount of
memory that you can allocate to the GPU
because as I said once you do allocate
that portion of your system memory to
the graphics processor that's all that
can be used for for example when in
Windows doing things that don't really
require much video memory at all you
just have a significant chunk of your
memory they're partitioned off that you
can't use so if you know select a 2
gigabyte buffer for example on a system
that has 8 gigabytes of ddr4 memory that
would mean that you now only have 6
gigabytes of system memory available but
you're a gamer and you want the maximum
gaming performance possible so just set
it to the highest value for those sweet
sweet frame rates well know again you
don't want to do that as I discussed
earlier when using a discreet graphics
card once the graphics memory or via Ram
fills up the game assets are just loaded
into the system memory in the case of
the Raven Ridge GPUs we're using system
memory exclusively so regardless of
whether you allocate 64 megabytes or 2
gigabytes it doesn't really matter for
example if a game requires 2 gigabytes
of video memory but you've only
allocated 64 megabytes usage to spills
over into the shared memory and because
it's all the same memory the bandwidth
remains the same and therefore within
reason so too does the performance as I
said windows manages this very well so
by allocating 2 gigabytes you're just
restricting the operating system's
ability to better manage the system
memory when trying to make sense of why
AMD was offering a 1 gigabyte or 2
gigabyte frame buffer I had initially
thought that maybe reserving a certain
amount of memory so 2u bytes would
ensure maximum gaming performance as the
operating system did
have to shuffle around things especially
when using just a gigabytes of RAM a
poster you know 16 gigabytes or more
however after testing various
configurations I found this had little
to no impact when gaming are certainly
nothing you'd actually notice using both
8 gigabytes and 16 gigabytes of dual
channel ddr3 200 memory with the exact
same timings I found our real difference
in performance between reserving 64
megabytes or 2 gigabytes of system
memory for example I did test half a
dozen different modern titles that all
called for around 2 to 3 gigabytes of
vram at 1080 P using the low to medium
quality settings but rather than look at
the half a dozen tiles that I've tested
all of which showed the exact same thing
I'm just showing the battlefield one
results at 720p and 1080p along with
some additional testing I did with Metro
last light as you can see with
battlefield 1 all the results are within
the margin of error for the 3 run
average and we're not just talking about
the average frame rate but also the
frame time performance as well I've
heard a few reports that Metro last
light of all games saw a massive
performance uplift when going from 512
megabytes to 2 gigabytes I stopped
testing with this title about three
years ago now so I thought that would be
odd if true but decided to check it out
anyway
as you might expect from this rather old
game it does use very little memory and
we saw no difference in performance when
comparing the average frame rate at 720p
and 1080p and the same is true for the
frame time results as well given what we
discussed previously before getting into
all the results this probably shouldn't
be that surprising regardless of whether
the Vega GPU is accessing data via the
allocated memory or not it's still using
the same system memory and therefore
it's limited the same bandwidth and in
our case that was around 35 gigabytes
per second in fact we can look at this a
little more closely
using the ADA 64 GPGPU benchmark tool we
can measure read and write performance
between the CPU and GPU effectively
measuring the performance the GPU can
move data in and out of its own device
memory into the system memory this is
called device to host bandwidth but more
importantly and this is what we're going
to focus on you can also look at copy
performance this test measures the
performance of the GPU memory by copying
data from its own device memory to
another place within the same device
memory so in the case of the rx 550 that
would be the onboard gddr5 memory but in
the case of the Raven Ridge
use that is our ddr4 system memory here
we can see that was 64 megabytes of RAM
allocated to the Vega at GPU and the
2200 G we have a throughput of 33 point
4 gigabytes per second when copying data
from within the system memory and that's
pretty much in line with a 35 gigabytes
per second the CPU cores have when
accessing the dual channel ddr3 200
memory if we increase the allocation
size to 2 gigabytes this has no impact
on bandwidth in fact based on an average
of 3 runs we saw a slight decrease but
of course these results are within the
margin of error given how long this test
takes to run it's safe to assume we're
transferring well over 2 gigabytes of
data so we're not just benchmarking
within the allocated buffer then if we
look at the rx 550 which as I've
mentioned many times in this video has a
theoretical peak bandwidth of 112
gigabytes per second we can see that in
this test it's good for 88 gigabytes per
second then for comparison I tried out
Vega 56 and we hit 321 gigabytes per
second and this model has a theoretical
peak bandwidth of 410 gigabytes per
second so all the evidence suggests that
setting the I GPU allocated memory
buffer beyond 64 megabytes is pointless
and on systems with limited Ram even a
bit foolish that said while I've tested
quite a few games and applications now I
haven't tested all of them of course I'm
just not able to simply aren't enough
hours in the day the only reason I can
think of why you might want to increase
the reserve memory buffer is for games
that need or detect a certain amount of
VRAM before they'll actually load we've
seen this in the past with games that
have these built-in safeguards that
won't allow you to load them without
meeting a minimum hardware spec it's
very annoying as the game developer
isn't really saving anyone from anything
certainly no real harm instead they're
just inconvenience gamers that probably
have acceptable hardware but they're
just waiting on a driver update to
improve detection I expect that AMD will
always deliver new drivers to solve
these issues if and when they arise but
we might see situations where in the
meantime gamers can increase the
allocation to meet the vram requirements
and that will allow them to load the
game so short of any potential
compatibility issues I can't really
think of any reasons why you'd want to
sacrifice more than 64 megabytes of
memory to the GPU but maybe you guys
have some ideas that I have
thought of also please note 64 megabytes
might be an extreme example maybe err on
the safe side and set it to 512
megabytes or you could just go with 64
megabytes like I am and wait till you
run into some kind of issue and if you
do run into an issue please let me know
about it because I would like to
investigate if you do happen to run into
an issue all you have to do is reset the
system increase the allocation size and
then boot back into Windows and you
should be right since most APU users
will be using 2 4 gigabyte memory
modules for an 8 gigabyte capacity
especially those buying the incredibly
good value risin 320 200 G for a hundred
and ten dollars u.s. those users will
want to save as much memory as possible
and by telling them to lop off one or
two gigabytes for the vaguer GPU seems
like really bad advice based on my
findings
so finally circling all the way back to
when I was discussing trying to make
sense of why AMD was offering up to a
two gigabyte frame buffer and there's
even been talk that AMD is pushing board
partners to offer a 4 gigabyte option so
I guess I have to ask the question why I
am D why give you customers the ability
to degrade their experience on your very
impressive Raven Ridge ap use well after
a bit of thinking I think your answer to
this question is probably quite obvious
it just has to do with marketing aim D
has to play the game and that's the game
of numbers big numbers bigger is always
better for example 2 gigabytes or up to
2 gigabytes of graphics memory sounds a
wee bit better than 64 megabytes and
that said AMD doesn't actually appear at
this stage to be advertising the vega 8
or vega 11 memory spec and maybe once
they push for that 4 gigabyte allocation
we'll start to see this pop up don't get
me wrong though it's certainly nice to
have this option should you need it for
whatever reason one of those reasons I
haven't yet thought of but in my opinion
aim D really needs to educate buyers on
the issue and probably reviewers as well
so we can inform you guys on which
settings you should be using and why I
Raven Ridge is far more appealing in the
low end if you can have almost all 8
gigabytes of your system memory when
using non gaming applications in Windows
rather than just being fixed with 6
gigabytes for example and that's where
