we're looking at one of the most
powerful laptops you can get in a
reasonable form factor for a reasonable
price the msi ge70 5 raider 9sf i say a
reasonable form factor because you can
get more powerful components such as 8
core cpus in big beastly systems like
msi so and GT 76 but a lot of gaming
laptop buyers don't want that sort of
chunky system which is why these sort of
mid tier designs end up being quite
popular the GE 75 Raider is a 17 inch
notebook with a 1080p 144 Hertz display
as standard this latest model packs
inside Intel's new core i7 97 58 CPU the
full laptop variant of nvidia geforce
r-tx 20 70 GPU so no max-q gimping here
plus 16 gigabytes of dual-channel ddr2
decent hunk of SSD storage it retails
for right on 2000 US dollars which is
standard for these specs in mid 2019 and
of course there'll be a full value
breakdown and discussion after all the
testing the design look it's nothing
special but that's typically what you
get with these mid tier products that
are straddling the sweet spot of
portability price and performance at 2.6
kilograms heavy and twenty seven point
five millimeters thick it's not the
biggest laptop going around but it's
also not a slim and light gaming machine
like the GS 75 which shaves off 400
grams in your sleek overall but the GS
75 is a much more expensive system and
for a lot of users that GE 75 will still
offer the portability you were looking
for I love the use of slim bezels around
the display I know this isn't the crazy
unique feature it once was but it still
helps to bring down the overall
footprint of the system and offer the
largest display possible within the
space available to it unlike MSI's other
slim bezel designs the camera is located
above the screen which means 0 nostril
vision issues MSI has constructed most
of this laptop out of either black metal
for the lid and keyboard area or black
plastic for the underside and display
housing again MSI isn't going for any
design awards here it's just a simple
sturdy construction that focuses on
functionality over premium looks there's
a few red highlights around the place
and a few seams you wouldn't get from
MSI flagship line
but overall I think the design succeeds
in not feeling overly cheap while
keeping as usable as possible
decent port selection three USB type 8
ports which are illuminated red a USB 3
point two gen2 type-c port HDMI 2.0
Ethernet two audio jacks mini display
port and an SD card reader all ports are
located on the sides but none block the
vents unlike some other msi designs
where the power cable can easily
restrict airflow add a side vent and
there's quite a few vents around the
edges of the laptop to maximize cooling
potential the best way to describe the
keyboard and trackpad are fine nothing
amazing nothing terrible just your
classic gaming laptop experience the
tactile feel to MSI's SteelSeries gaming
laptop keyboard says never amazed me too
much but the layout is acceptable the
numpad is basically a requirement on a
17 inch device and you get perky RGB
backlighting through the SteelSeries
engine I should also make mention of two
buttons just below the power button one
is for changing keyboard lighting
profiles and the other activates MSI's
cooler boost functionality which cranks
the fans up to maximum when you need
that extra performance or cooling power
of course performance is the main
feature of this laptop so let's get
in-depth on how the system performs
starting with the CPU the Intel Core i7
97 50 H I've already done a full
performance investigation into how this
CPU performs in this specific laptop
which you should check out if you
haven't already gives a good breakdown
of performance in popular apps compared
to other recent CPUs the main takeaway
is that the core i7 9750 H Intel's new
9th gen 6 core CPU is not materially
faster than the last gen core i7 8750 H
so if you're tossing up between a new
9th gen model and an older 8th gen model
and the 8th gen system is a lot cheaper
you're really not losing out on anything
by going last gen while the 9750 H is
clocked higher on paper in real-world
workloads that higher clock speed
doesn't translate into significantly
better performance that's not to say the
msi ge70 5 is slow it's not at all in
fact it's one of the fastest laptops you
can get in this size class and the 9750
edges to a very capable CPU it's just
only 3 to 4 percent faster than the best
8750 h laptops out there which for many
buyers isn't going to be enough to
justify say a 2
to $300 price increase where the GE 75
impressed me more is with the
performance of the NVIDIA GeForce r-tx
2070 laptop earning to start with though
I will mention that the RDX between 74
notebooks is not the same as the r-tx
2070 for desktops in fact I did an
entire comparison between the desktop
and laptop models where the desktop PC
wins by around 20% that's down to the
laptop variant being clocked 180 mega
Hertz lower than the desktop card the
naming sucks and it is confusing but
I've covered that plenty of times now
note the part that impressed me was
simply that this is the fastest lap top
GOP I've tested up until this points
granted I haven't checked out the RT X
2080 but given its 600 to 800 dollars
more it's probably not in consideration
for a lot of buyers and won't be great
value instead for around that $2,000
mark the RT X 2070 is faster than the
gtx 1070 faster than the RT x 2070 max-q
and even faster than the RT x 2080 max-q
so it certainly packs all of punch so
let's work through some performance
breakdowns and I'll start with that
impressive result versus the RT X 28
Emacs Q this really shows how under
clocks the RT X 20 80 max Q comes even
the faster 90 watt version loses to the
RT X 2070 in the msi ge70 v with the 27
t pulling ahead by 5 percent on average
this will you chose the advantage of
getting a mid-sized unit like the GE 75
over a slimming light such as the GS 75
from a performance perspective there's
simply more room for cooling which means
the laptop can house a higher TDP GPU
and that leads to better performance
slimming lights are basically maxed out
with the 20 80 max Q at least with
current GPU architectures while systems
like the GE 75 have more headroom
available not to mention a 20 80 max Q
system will set you back $650 more than
the GE 75 with a 20 70 so once again if
you go slim and light you really need to
justify that extra portability a more
relevant comparison is the RT X 2070
versus the gtx 1070 previous laptops
with sh asses like the GS 75 often came
loaded with the gtx 1070 inside and
delivered impressive performance however
the RT x 2070 in the GE 75 is 15% faster
on average than our aggregate results
for the gtx 1070 laptops we've tested
previously
even compared to the ASA predator Heroes
500 which is one of the fastest gtx 1070
laptops i've tested the GE 75 is still
12% faster with an RT x 2070 inside
interested in an RT x 2070 max q laptop
well the fully fledged variant is 20%
faster on average again if you're
interested in slimming light systems you
really need to want that extra
portability because you'll be losing out
on performance it's also worth
highlighting the gap between the RT x
2070 and RT x 2060 because many laptops
of this size including the GE 75 are
available with an RT x 2060 inside in my
testing the ITX 2070 comes away 26%
faster on average which is larger than
the margin you'll see between these GPUs
in desktop systems but this makes
perfect sense the desktop RT X 2070 is
clocked lower than the RT X 2060 but has
more CUDA cores so it's usually up to
about 15% faster if that
however the RT X 2074 laptops has both a
core count and significant clock speed
advantage
hence we end up with this sort of large
margin these breakdowns don't give a lot
of insight into how the GPU performs in
real world games so here's a few quick
charts in Metro Exodus you can clearly
see the system performing well
delivering over an 80 FPS average using
ultra settings at 1080p in resident evil
2 you're looking at over 130 FPS in this
title which makes the laptops suitable
for high refresh gaming in battlefield 5
our 100 FPS average at 1080p again shows
the power of this system given the GE 75
uses a 144 Hertz display the art X 370
is making good use of that extra refresh
rate Headroom when available
I should note here that I tested the GE
75 using the default settings which
delivers strong performance this means
using the sport performance shift mode
and auto fan speeds while you can enable
cooler boost which blasts the fans at
100% I found that in most circumstances
the auto fan setting would ramp the fans
up near this level anyway but unlike
cooler boost would also ramp them down
at idle the one thing to mention is the
optional turbo mode which provides a
slight 100 megahertz GPU overclock and
200 megahertz of VRAM memory overclock
you'll add a few extra frames to your
in-game performance for not much
downside so it's something I'd recommend
and the reason why the turbo mode works
well is the cool performance figures the
GPU sits at a mere 75 degrees during a
watchdogs to gaming session with CPU
temperatures of 85 degrees that's very
reasonable for a laptop and right up
there with some of the better designs
I've tested having this sort of cooling
Headroom is good for a number of reasons
firstly the GE 75 runs pretty loud under
load while using the auto mode up around
48 DBA but with the GPU only running at
75 degrees depending on your ambient
conditions you could lower the fan
speeds and get a more pleasant
experience with that any performance
loss or you could do some light
overclocking it also should mean the
r-tx 2080 variant can run at its
intended frequencies without significant
throttling although I haven't tested
that model to make sure MSI loaded my
unit with a one terabyte samsung PM 9 81
SSD although I believe 512 gigabytes is
standard performance from this SSD is
excellent and exceeds what is necessary
for gaming by a long way internally you
also get a good selection of storage
slots quick mention of the display as
well it's a 17 inch 1080p 144 Hertz IPS
unit which is reasonably common among
high-end gaming machines these days it's
a good panel but it won't blow you away
it achieves around 270 units of peak
brightness a 10 60 to 1 contrast ratio
and color performance out of the box is
around a delta a average of 3.0 with a
slightly incorrect white point this is
an average result among gaming laptops
but the real highlight here is the 144
Hertz refresh rate which is great for
gaming there's no G sync support which
is a trade-off to get GPU switching for
better battery life speaking of battery
life the GE 75 includes a 51 watt hour
battery inside which is somewhat below
average for this sort of gaming machine
and as expected it lasts around 4 hours
in our video playback battery test not a
terrible result but not at the level of
other more portable gaming notebooks
overall the msi ge70 5 is a pretty great
gaming laptop it's not a super top-tier
premium offering so the design is a
little on the basic side but makes up
for that with excellent performance a
great 1080p high refresh display decent
storage and best of all a highly capable
cooling solution if you want to play
games and you
want your gaming system to be highly
portable the GE 75 will deliver that for
you now that the dust is settled on
Nvidia's mobile our TX lineup I think
what the msi ge70 5 is offering is in a
bit of a price to performance sweet spot
right now
this laptop sits at $2,000 while we have
our TX 2060 laptops at around the $1700
mark and our TX 2080 laptops at $2,700
given the our TX 2070 is 26 percent
faster than the ITX 2060 when comparing
laptop variants yet cost just 18% more
that's a good spot for the 2070 to be in
and it's in contrast to the desktop line
where the 2060 is the better buy from a
value standpoint as for the r-tx 2080
well I haven't tested it just yet but it
it has to be at least 25 to 30% faster
to justify the price increase which is
probably going to be pushing it a little
and the max-q brands aren't even worth
talking about because they are typically
slower and much worse value simply by
virtue of their inclusion in premium
slim and light laptops which prioritize
size over outright performance with all
that said the thorn in the side of
current gen laptop manufacturers
continues to be older Pascal laptops
given that the core i7 97 58 doesn't
offer much in the way of performance
gains over the 87 50 H there is still
some decent last gen buyers to be had
while the msi ge70 5 and r-tx 2070
laptops are good by among the current
generation if you can get a gtx 1070
laptop with an 80 750 h for under $1600
I think you'll be pretty happy of course
you won't get the same performance as
the 2070 but if you don't quite have the
cash for this level of performance a
1070 for that price is much better value
than an RT X 2060 but of course Pascal
laptops aren't going to be around
forever and they've become harder to
find since I last touched on the subject
also worth mentioning is the fact that
you can get some older 8750 H laptops
with the RT X 27 T in it for pretty good
prices so again it's worth checking out
what is available in your region so yeah
a bit of a mixed conclusion here with a
variety of thoughts but I think it's
safe to say the msi ge70 5 and the RT x
27 used here is the first time I'd swing
more towards recommending and NVIDIA
artex laptop than not I like the
performance offered here and the fact
don't need a super big boy muscle book
style laptop to get it still find it
amusing that Intel invented the term
muscle book for those laptops anyway if
you're interested in some of the laptops
I've talked about here you can check out
