making it possible for Tim and myself to
attend Computex 2019 please check out
their latest AMD x5 70 motherboards made
for gamers and creators by the link in
the video description also thank you to
Corsair for their support please check
all their exciting products out via the
link in the video description welcome
back to harbor unboxed i am the only one
that gets to talk in this episode of
unbagging bags cuz we're going with one
microphone Tim's gonna do all the work
for I'm bagging the bags and I'm gonna
hold the mic and make my mic for those
of you who haven't well last year Tim
disarmed the last a bit a bit of time
you ran around and got a heap of goodies
off the showroom floor and you guys
seemed to really enjoy that it was just
a silly nothing video at the end of copy
check sort of to relax and unwind a bit
and we collected a bit of stuff
throughout the week but we went today
and we got some few really cool things I
think so we thought hey let's sit down
show you guys what we got and just
that's it really there's not much more
to it that's it but because we don't
have a microphone set up I have to hold
the reporter Mike so you know I'll
mostly do this and occasional look at
stuff but Tim's gonna be our model it's
gonna be our booth babe that checks
everything out for us get on with it Tim
alright so first that we have we got
these from our corsair booth tour in the
grand hyatt this week obviously because
they're there Corsair things but these
were Computex survival kids is that
right Tim yeah so we've got here a
number of packets I thought I'll hold
this - okay cool I'll sit or nothing so
we've got a number of packs you've got a
super orange vitamin C packet we've got
an Advil I believe this is ibuprofen so
just in case you like Steven you get
headaches all the time here's some more
of that you can see like a tank's all
the time we've got some peppermints
we've got some Purell so that you don't
have to get germs off all the filthy
plebs on the show and um I believe this
is like an electrolyte powder so - it's
a pretty it's not bad it's pretty good
yeah so we've got one of those H
speak into the mic stay professional yes
that's pretty good we got one of those
HS you can say we haven't used them yet
because we saved them from packing bags
I look terribly sick so hopefully we
survived okay without a hit spinning
right so that that's pretty cool from
course they're actually like formal
containers as well so maybe we can
breathe purpose that for something else
this is also a gift from Corsair so
they're really trying to spoil us this
year and we have a new hydro ex like
wasn't flask
so the flask so or is it their new
liquid cooling reservoirs yeah it's a
flask so that's kind of cool
that's something we'll definitely use
and we thank you Corsair for our flasks
Elementium flasks pretty good quality
yeah hydro Foster says hydrofloss keep
things nice and cool depending on what
it is you want to do with the things you
put in it
mobile call center stuff is just the
last of the course a key Jim yeah
believe sir there's a little baggies Tim
loves little baggies what's in it so
it's like a nylon bag I'll be we'll get
b-roll for a lot of this stuff so I want
describe it so much is that a big 15
when he's 18 how'd it go Sara no I think
it's just a back I said it's a little
baggie for a bigger baggie
is that like I shut the shopping bag so
you don't waste plastic I think so and
of course as being environmentally
conscious we go to those go Timken
Julie's shopping out in style some
Corsair key give me one of them I need
oh so this is from MSI they we are
craters this is from the new prestige
line of products and they know that us
creditors are always stressed out right
in the comments section so now we can
just sit there reading your comments
just with one of these in hand and yeah
we'll probably crush it down to nothing
before too long but that's cool it's
kind of nice having a stress ball it's
not usual Bowl it's a stress
pentagonal thing thing yeah we've got
that right for sure
Oh many dragons I think we do we get
many dragons last year I don't think so
I'm gonna open this like a professional
you ready oh we got it dragon oh you
taste like oh oh it's on fellows oh you
killed it a wedding my shirt hang out
we're just getting the dragon arm back
on my shirt
I'll put it together for successful
surgery get my shoe back on I think I
broke it when I popped it out no I think
it's arms are meant to okay no I did not
meant to move no there's no dragons were
hurt during the filming of this I'm
bagging bags episode excellent hang in
there okay
that's lucky the dragon by the way for
those of you wondering we have some
Corsair boxes not course it oh cool
Master too many Corsair things apologies
cool master it's not Corsair Tim is
right cooler master have given us little
cardboard boxes with little they're like
the bags your PSU is coming now it's a
brand leather pouch thing yeah it looks
like to following that
oh so that's for your keys I think it's
got a bag of do not eat yep do you not
eat so it's like the key rings okay so
incapable your keys neatly tucked away
and there that's pretty cool something
to might use I reckon looks like it to
me accessory if you say so
well thank you cool a master for our
little leather pouch eating's
Oh MSI lightning this will be good is it
a mini graphics card it's like a mini
mini ITX cards pretty mini so it's a
rubberized
US based you come guessing yeah in this
lab branding oh no idea how many gigs
that is Sangha oh don't think it says I
play they didn't cheap out on us with
that one it's pretty cool looking and
he's cooler gives it beer I'll be so
tiny yeah yeah we're some ear off that
that's probably a neat little set piece
or something little
trinket thing but anyway that's cool I
showed me that really got one apparently
she was taking that so we'll have to
negotiate on something I'll still Iowa
this was a gift from deep cool for
visiting their booth so they've given us
a tape you should tease is it cookies if
so it looks like a lot of cookies okay
there'll be sucking up get some b-roll
and someone will be able to tell us
exactly what there are no definitely a
formas in the comment section below we
much appreciate one yeah it wouldn't be
right if we're computationally it's
toppling on camera so we got two of
those waiting teams one because he is he
gets the us baby okay that's a hard so
the cookie thing it looks kind of nice
mmm wow that's really nice I'm liking
that it's like a honey cookie hmm can
you say golden syrupy treacly yeah yup
yep this is another thing mm-hmm how's
that easily gone hmm
mm-hmm maybe we should pause for a
minute hopefully there's no biscuit in
my teeth and we're good to continue so
what have we got here Jim what's the
next thing you pulled out is a it's a
gigabyte your ISM okay it's a gigabyte
USB three probably memory stick
hopefully not trolling us and it's one
gigabyte thankfully it's bigger than
that
I think it's 32 gigabytes actually I've
heard that there are 32 devices once
you're at cookie crumbs
it doesn't say you can throw up some
bait all of that it's a really sleek
looking usb3 thryce yeah so thank you
gigabyte will actually put that to you
so it'll be handy for transferring a few
files around as you do plain brown box
showing labels whatsoever
I just love a no idea what this is at
all what's this AMD on it did you get me
from AMD I did I went to the press room
oh that's right I didn't go I stayed
back into all the work so anyway so here
you got I mean so what is it I think
it's a battery okay I'll do has wireless
charging because there's a wireless your
phone as well as Jackie yeah put it down
hmm maybe it needs to be enabled I don't
know
stop looking obvious my phone does have
while charging there but Stephanie got
to use people's yeah so that's what it's
all like why don't don't don't really
know what that's for you know right
right the manual it doesn't look like it
seemed too much English mmm yeah don't
here's wall charger I think it's just
you know regular sort of thing somewhat
misleading design there anyway thank you
Amy it looks like I'm going to take that
one since you get the USB Drive so yeah
I can charge my phone yeah you but
if I couldn't already you know I can
wherever I am for a limited time I'll
try and open one of these and hold the
microphone there we go think I've done
that I know if anything fell they are oh
yeah whoo
I can be recording this all time there
yet
it's flashing ready to go hit record I
was almost going to ask you to check
them like natural he's done now to argue
so I just noticed that the microphones
audio recorder wasn't recording it is
now so it probably sounds different
possibly at least we didn't do that once
throughout the entire week so we do have
a microphone on the camera hopefully
that sounds ok but yeah we might stick
with that audio if it's actually better
than this
but that's a little bit embarrassing
anyway all your through which is great
it's not my fault change whatever it's
your fault for leaving me in charge of
audio okay so I've got I'll talking in
this mic still so I'll just go with that
and perchance been working the whole
time I've got a little dude with a
little mask is like a deep cool Iron Man
I think so that is the oh cool yep yep I
think were used in the thumbnail so
we've got our own little anti leak tech
inside valve I can actually feel the air
coming out it's pretty hard though isn't
it yes so hmm without any context this
conversation could be weird let's just
put that back in there and move along
with our new slightly clearer audio
that's a screwdriver for those of you at
home I was actually I saw this at the be
quiet booth now only had one I felt kind
of bad because they gave it to us they
let us take their display screwdriver
but yeah be quite screwdriver how cool
is that I've got a thermal right one I
think this one's even cooler
so other thermal right one for years and
years and years and when I saw the be
quite what a mic I kind of have to have
that so yeah feel a little bit guilty
but thank you being quiet for my
screwdriver I'm gonna take that home and
use it for when I'm building systems and
whatnot
looks like it's got a magnetic tip so
that's very cool all right what have we
got here we've got a collection of
somethings hey I tell you wreck the
locks unit so I put called unboxing
boxes or anything we're meant to be
professional unboxers Tim's just making
a mess of this try to make me feel
better for the audio oh that is awesome
so this is a keychain fan of course it's
knocked to her they're not going to make
a keychain that's not a proper fan that
was probably in development for two
years that keychain and if a for to ask
they've given a product name and
everything
Clutton classic Noctua so that is that's
really cool it's even got the rubber
anti-vibration pads in the corner no I
don't know I don't think they do at the
moment I don't know if they're going to
but it's definitely something I should
look at selling because that's a cool
little keychain yeah I think yeah PC
enthusiasts would like to have those so
we've got four well three now because
you wrecked the box for the other one
but yeah maybe that's something we can
give away on the channel if you guys are
interested so we'll keep these three or
brand-new and we'll we'll look at doing
that in some future content but that's
that's probably it's probably close to
the best probably the coolest thing so
far I think yeah yeah I like that that's
awesome
all right this is a hybrid actually
because be quite also gave us these bags
they saw us walking around the showroom
floor and we're really really struggling
to carry all this gear so they gave us
two bags there's a zipper in the front
as well so you go a little pouch I just
closed it anyway Tim you just you just
take out what's in there
No so they gave us these cool little
bags and they're actually carrying
noctua hoodies so not too were kind
enough to also give us some really cool
looking hoodies that they had there Tim
got a medium I got an XL this feels so
warm feel that oh yeah wow that's a
really high quality so knocked or
delivering on all the goods they don't
do anything in Hobbes everything's high
quality with them in the back it says on
the back it says premium cooling
solution yeah it's probably a premium
warming solution but Wow so is that the
XL one yeah that's yours hang and I'll
check this on one moment to warm boot
iPage definitely true warm Taipei but
I'll be taking at home and we're coming
into Weezer at home so now I'm not gonna
embarrass myself what's it about
so yeah I really like this thing I'm now
a Sith Lord and I'm warm so not that was
a problem in Taipei but this will be
really good the highest quality apparel
yeah I've seen yeah this is probably the
best quality hoodie I now iron so yeah
thank you for thank you for that Noctua
it's very typical if not two of the
products are really high quality so how
much makes sense yep but now I know I
now have the best keychain trinket that
I've ever got and the best hoodie so
yeah I think this thing comes down as
well thanks Tim tree sit closer together
again that was from the QA yeah that's
it so way better than last year last
year we just got kind of a whole heap of
garbage - maybe a couple of things but
mousepad and stuff that was kind of
useful yeah we got our stress balls that
match our hoodies so they're they're
good happy game usually get like a foggy
stick or something
yeah I got thirty twos even the the deep
cool the little pressure vessel things
that that's pretty cool good to see that
that'll go up in the set somewhere yeah
they are so I think they know that we're
starting to do things like not well not
just us but other youtubers as well as
Sonya shaft things they get so they're
sort of gonna step up their game a bit
but anyway I I had fun sitting back here
and messing up the audio and doing just
just ruining this video yeah by sitting
back relaxingg so anyway thank you for
watching I'm your host Steve I'm your
host Tim well done and like subscribe
shared all that stuff support us on
patreon if you want to get access to our
exclusive discord chat monthly live
streams where Tim and I sit back and do
stuff not that dissimilar to this but
anyway thank you for watching and I'll
see you again next time
