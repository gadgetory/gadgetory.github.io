true harbor unboxed I've said that line
many times now and it was just yesterday
I was thinking about how long I've been
creating YouTube videos for and I
realized it's been about a year now in
fact it was actually October 18th 2016
that I created my first video or at
least jumped in front of the camera for
the first time because I have been part
of the harbor box channel since day one
I was never meant to be something that I
dedicated a good portion of my time to i
rather is just something i did for fun
on the side with Matt when Matt left
harbor unboxed late last year so October
we worried about I think was thirty two
thousand subscribers and we were only
growing by a few thousand each month it
took us 18 months in total to reach the
32,000 subscriber mark and at the time
we're both pretty amazed with that
unfortunately I despite generating well
over half a million views each month the
channel is making virtually nothing in
terms of money and it was really just
getting harder and harder for Matt and
myself to justify the time effort and
money that we were investing in the
channel obviously Matt decided to move
on invest his time elsewhere which is
fair enough and well that kind of left
me with a bit of a tough decision to
make I pretty much had the choice of
jumping in front of the camera but also
taking on the entire channel which
there's a whole lot of stuff involved in
running her YouTube channel that's
pretty full-on or I could just axe the
channel basically just let it wither
away and die well obviously I decided
the former and here we are I think
things have gone about as well as they
could have over the past twelve months
we now sit at just over 150,000
subscribers yeah I think it's it's gone
really well the channel 2 still doesn't
make a whole lot of money but you know
whatever I certainly don't do it for the
money for me the funds in gathering the
results you know shooting editing making
the videos and of course engaging with
you guys the viewers in the comment
section I always really enjoy doing that
and over the last 12 months I've
certainly learnt a lot about presenting
and video making and all that stuff but
I'm sure there's much more to learn as
we go on it is kind of fun to look back
though
one of my first videos in fact it was my
second ever video was a review on
Samsung's 960 pro 1 terabyte SSD and am
looking back it's kind of hard to watch
that video it's also a bit funny when I
do and I think 52,000 people of now
watch that one since then I've made 254
videos so over the 12 months that
basically works out to be a video every
day and a half every 34 hours so yeah
actually a few of those videos were made
by Tim but whatever in the last 12
months there's been plenty of content on
the channel
speaking of Tim he is currently in the
final stages of wrapping up his
university degree and then next year he
will be joining the harbour unbox team
which will be me and Tim full-time and
hopefully together we can take this
thing to the next level all that said
though whatever happens going forward I
just like to thank all of you for
watching supporting the channel and yeah
it's just really appreciate everyone who
stops and leaves a comment and hits the
like button and well just watches the
videos of course a big thank you to all
of our patreon members those guys are
just amazing and with use YouTube's
Adsense being the way that it is at the
moment it's quite volatile I really do
appreciate the guys that support us
directly and help us keep on going and
hopefully with Tim helping out next year
it'll give me a bit more time to give
back to the patron supporters so I've
given myself a nice old pat on the back
for making videos for 12 months and I
thank you guys for just being awesome so
I guess now it's time to answer a few of
your questions okay first question
actually I'll just let you guys know
that I did ask on Twitter if you guys
had any questions any questions at all I
would answer them in this video
I've got 50-plus questions so sorry if I
don't get to your question I'll probably
only do about 20 of them for this video
but anyway first one is from neo voodoo
tech at neo video gaming tell us about
your first gaming PC experience was it
recent or long ago what sparked the fire
what got you into hardware and computers
well okay I was going to try and just
power through all these but this is kind
of a big one still I'll try and be as
quick as possible
so my first real gaming PC experience
that was back in high school like 20
years ago a couple here it's been that
long now a friend of mine received what
was at the time a high-end gaming system
for his parents for his birthday I
believe it had a Vudu graphics card in
it from memory it's quite funny I
remember at the time thinking well
what's all the fuss about just a
computer surely my Nintendo is better
for gaming right then he showed me 3d
accelerated MechWarrior 2 and my mind
was just completely blown the graphics
were phenomenal for the time so straight
after playing MechWarrior 2 on his pc I
saved up and less than a year later I
hit the local computer swap meet with
yeah really no idea of what I was doing
so be ambitious but I think I had $1,500
Australian and I set out to build my
first gaming PC it was very exciting
times
so yeah went to swap meet I bought all
the bits and two days later a lot of
messing around I remember those memory
compatibility issues and things back
then but anyway got it working and I've
never looked at a console since so the
second part of the question at first it
was just about gaming for me but before
too long I became pretty interested in
overclocking and tinkering with the
hardware side of things and there's much
more of the story but yeah what headed
me down the path of testing and
reviewing PC hardware was just yet
tinkering around my own computer and
found it very exciting of course being a
teenager at the time it was just all
about gaming but it really wasn't too
long before I became interested in
things like overclocking I did have a
seller on 300a and I purchased that
because you could overclock it and I
think I ran mine at 450 megahertz but
anyway yeah got into the overclocking
tinkering side of things and that's
pretty much what put me on the path to
rewards where I've ended up there's
obviously a lot more to the story but
that's pretty much the gist of it so
thank you neo voodoo tech that was a
very good question alright next we have
a question from JC at JC Muir
congratulations mate hope thank you
quick
chan is a 10-8 et is Li setup worth it
for 4k gaming and what is the biggest 4k
g-sync lighter there is hmm worth it
yeah SL eyes never really worth it from
a value perspective but I've always sort
of said if you have the money to burn on
something like you know to ty n GPUs
like a pair of 1080 eyes then why not
am i right oh yeah as much as I dislike
SLI and crossfire I've always said that
if you're going to use those
technologies then do so with the
absolute most extreme GPUs available at
the time excluding anything with Titan
in the name of course as for the biggest
g-sync monitor I believe that award goes
to either the Acer predator Z 35 or the
HP omen X 35 and there as the numbers in
the name suggest they're both 35 inch
displays I don't know I haven't used
either of them but looking at the specs
I think the HP would be probably the
model I would go for for that larger
resolution and I hope that answers your
questions JC but next question Steve at
not not Steven right oh why is the
universe the way it is hmm I feel like
that's probably more of a science studio
question so let's move on Warwick phirni
lat Gabriel of park yep I put up that
right what was your biggest PC disaster
biggest PC disaster that's um hmm that's
a tricky one in lots of little disasters
not the biggest one would be I guess
when I was reviewing the in win tow I
think that's how it's pronounced I
smashed a panel on it so that's a all
glass tempered glass case that looks
quite fancy does have quite thin panels
on it but yeah when I was removing it I
moved it bumped it into something Pat
member what and shattered one of the
front little panels on it and it's a
$1,200 limited edition case so yeah it
wasn't really a disaster though I
suppose because in wind just shipped out
a replacement panel so
can I do better than that actually for a
proper disaster I have to go way back
like 14 years ago 2003 when I was
reviewing the Athlon XP 3200 plus enough
many of you guys watching this video are
familiar with that processor but it was
actually very good AMD processor back in
the day though the Athlon XP series did
have a tendency to go up in smoke
if the cooler wasn't seated correctly or
wasn't there at all
so anyway I just seated a Oh actually I
just seated the CPU so no cooler at all
I just put the CPU in the socket a
socket and that being yeah me being the
amateur let's say that I am the system
was plugged in at the wall of time so
that was powered off but I just put the
CPU and I was lazy and left the power
cord in and the power supply was flicked
on these days I always obviously
flickered off but I'm working on it but
hey I was young and stupid let's say
anyway I made of mine had just turned up
with the intention of playing a couple
of games there was a knock at the door
it was a delivery so I jumped up went
and got that came back a minute or two
later and there was a burning bit of a
strange smell in the room and my mate
was sitting there looking a bit guilty
he got a bit excited to play some game
saw the test system there paid no
attention or what was in this system hit
the power button on the case and yeah
those of you that are familiar with the
Athlon XP is in one second they just up
in smoke in that sitting there was a
$500 us almost $500 us processor at the
time and I had to go and buy one the
next day so that stung anyway that was
lesson learnt I think I only killed
about three or four more of those over
the next you testing crappy soccer day
coolers okay so moving on from cooking
burning igniting Athlon XP process we
have a question here from wild @db wild
thing yes or no pineapple pizza
I'd have to say hell no but that's only
because I just don't like pineapple .
okay
goat emoji at literally is just a goat
emoji and you'll see it on the screen at
3 LD 3 will the
Lola's ole let's just leave it at that
how long is your usual workday or rather
how many hours / week I think you means
per week do you put into your channel
what is your most and least favorite
video to make okay
I'd say this year a typical workday has
been at least 12 hours now probably more
like 14 to 16 hours would probably be
the norm I'd say I've been pretty much
doing this seven days a week so yeah
every day oh yeah it's a good thing it
doesn't really feel like a job it's just
a whole lot of fun but yeah it does get
tiring at times but yeah I hope to back
off a bit more next year once Tim's
helping out YouTube is very demanding at
the moment so having Tim helping will be
fantastic so my favorite video well it's
a bit of a tough one I really like a lot
of the content we do I'm probably a bit
biased but yeah I've really grown to
enjoy the unboxing boxes series that
Matt started yeah sort of initially I
wasn't that into that but you guys seem
to really enjoy it and got me into it a
bit more and yeah I really enjoy doing
that and of course I love the big
benchmark videos but as for a favorite
they've been quite a lot of good videos
this year not trying to sound like I
think I contains brilliant or anything
but yeah I think we've done a quite a
few good benchmark videos this year so I
don't know if I could really pick a
favorite I did really enjoy the testing
behind that risin 5 1600 vs. core i7 77
okay and that was the one using Vegas 64
and the GTX 1080 so yeah that video was
good as for my least favorite well least
favorite I that's a tough one because I
don't really do any videos that I don't
enjoy doing mmm I guess
thinking back to a recognition probably
the most stressful time for me and sort
of the videos I didn't really like doing
I'm not that I didn't like doing and
they just stressful
was the Computex coverage that was
pretty hellish if I'm honest I have went
into Computex
really having no idea what that was like
as a YouTube creator how much was
involved and it turns out there aren't
enough hours in the day to even come
close to covering five percent of what's
at Computex and all the events going on
a stuff so let's provide right off my
feet for a week yeah kind of sport the
experience and it was a great trip
really but yeah just a lot of work so I
think because those videos were so
stressful and time you know time
sensitive and whatever I didn't enjoy
that as much as I could have I probably
wasn't as prepared as well as I should
have been or it's pretty hard when
you've never done it before anyway next
year I will have Tim helping me at
Computex and I hope to have a hell of a
lot more fun all right next question and
I'm so bad at pronouncing the names you
guys need me the hardest time of reverse
magma at robotis magma what inspired you
to test a wide range of games and other
applications on multiple hardware
configurations yeah another good
question a lot of good questions from
you guys
curiosity mostly I would have to say
like I really just like working out how
certain Hardware performers in certain
games you know just testing a couple of
games it doesn't always give you the
full picture sometimes it does but
sometimes it doesn't it so anyway yeah
I'd take curiosity and I just try to
deliver the best content I possibly can
it was really probably mostly because of
you guys because YouTube you engage with
the audience so much more than I've sort
of experienced previously doing written
stuff on tech sites and you guys are
always like I want our three included I
want GTA 5 included and this so many
games requested heavily by so many
different people that we sort of when we
did the GPU head-to-heads I was like
okay this game has to be included this
game has to be included and those games
you have to include because they're new
and before long the list just kept
growing at 12 games 16 games 20 games 30
games so I think that's part of the
reason any I just like to try and
deliver yeah the best content possible
and I think all the hard work
doing that really has helped Harbor a
box standout and they just see of
channels on YouTube so yeah that's a
bonus
all right next question is from a bingo
snow at I'll leave that one ah warm
toilet seat or cold just as I said the
questions have been really good this
isn't a good question
warm toilet seat or cold so I have to
pick one because I you know I'd like a
warm toilet seat in winter that'd be
nice and then a cool one in summer but
yeah short of that if I had to settle on
one can it just be like room temperature
so I suppose that's warm yeah okay yeah
moving on all right next up we have a
question from Jacob do you plan
reviewing gaming peripherals do you plan
on reviewing gaming peripherals as well
so mice keyboards and headsets how do we
plan on reviewing peripherals again well
yes that is definitely something we do
plan on doing you know Matt used to do a
lot of that on the channel it was sort
of more in Matt's wheelhouse you liked
playing around keyboards mice headsets
and Bluetooth speakers and that kind of
stuff
I've been featuring there more in the
unboxing boxes and I get that's not
really a technical review that's
something I definitely expect Tim will
be interested in picking back up
alongside his laptop and use technical
monitor testing and reviews and stuff
like that you'll probably do some
roundup so you'll see some gaming mice
around ups and he'll probably get a lot
more in depth with the more technical
more scientific with them testing of
mice than we ever have on the channel so
yeah that could be something to look
forward to thank you for your question
Jacob Andre Paley at jailer 14 do you
think the people are sometimes a bit too
emotional about tech like Lowell Intel
sucks don't buy them or AMD sucks and
throwing around insults yeah I do it's
okay to prefer one particular company
and I can certainly understand someone
you know sticking with a brand they know
and they've had a good experience with
however childish behavior like the
example it was just given there
you know people attacking one another
just because they like a certain brand
or whatever just poor conduct in general
it's really disappointing to see I have
to say I do try to stop that out as much
as I possibly can on the channel and
I'll probably get a lot more aggressive
with that in the future especially as I
say with Tim helping out I'll have more
time to moderate that kind of stuff so
yeah you'll see me sort of jumping on
that a bit more than I have been I
really do like when I come across you
know a group of tech enthusiasts that
are having a discussion about AMD Nvidia
or Intel whatever it may be and they're
doing it in a really constructive and
you know polite all that kind of stuff
good comment etiquette and then you see
someone just jump in there and make a
childish comment just derail the thread
it all goes to crap so yeah I definitely
want to jump on that a bit more and stop
that from happening but that's yeah to
answer your question yeah I do okay next
question from echo at Zen strive why do
you choose to look like a cubicle drone
also please review a full tower case
that is less than $150 USD and has an 8
expansion slots ah alright well what do
you mean you don't like my shirts come
on what's wrong with the shirts well you
give me a hard time at the shirts guys
just back off on the shirts what was the
other part yes the case review well I
can see I can certainly see what I can
do about the case review a $150 full
Tower that expansion slots yep I'll look
into that for you buddy shirt hater all
right where was I Adam at major Z Man
what's your main source of income smiley
face I guess you knows that's a bit of a
cheeky question given a little smiley
face at the end there anyway to the
question I can tell you it certainly
isn't YouTube not yet anyway it's
helping but yeah it's a smaller piece
there I don't really have a main source
which out today is kind of nice yeah not
all eggs are in one bar
there are a few different sources that
keep me afloat so here that's nice
yeah you have to be a bit dynamic at
this level I'm sure there'll be other
content creators it'll tell you the same
you still have to branch out and do a
few different things I think once you're
north of a million subscribers you can
probably start looking at YouTube full
time so yeah get back to me in 10 years
time okay next up we have prathamesh o
9f I said that right what oh sorry
ah you in favor of teams implementing
the halo cockpit in f1 next year okay
well for those of you who everyone fans
are know anything about f1 it's open
cockpit racing and sometimes when the
cars go under things in accidents or
flip over the driver can be at serious
risk there it's kind of a controversial
thing at the moment as for my opinion on
it honestly might sound a bit bad
because you know I know this is all in
the name of safety but yeah my answer
would be no not really in favor of it
yeah I think it pretty much spoils the
complete look at the cars and I'm not
really convinced it's needed
that said though like most race fans
it'll probably get to like midsi's and
I'll get over it more just keep
complaining about how you can't follow
and do the air or something like that so
yeah thanks for the f1 related question
alright next question from indigo deep
debt deet deet probably at neo old
you've okay in your opinion I know it's
not the best time to be building a
gaming PC he said that but still
possible but is it still possible to
make it worth it
seconds still there tripped me up a bit
okay is it still worth it yeah I'd say
it's still worth it you can get GeForce
graphics cards aren't too bad the RMD
fanboys incoming pretty hard for just
recommending Nvidia but I something like
a GTX 1060 graphics card they're very
capable and they're quite well priced
they're not too far off the MSRP and
even the GTX
ten 70s aren't to about either at the
moment so I think they're sort of
starting to normalize a little bit there
I've even noticed other Radeon graphics
cards are coming down I think I saw some
rx5 80s for 250 us which is still above
the MSRP they were only the 4 gigabyte
models and I think they're meant to be
more like 200 us so they're still $50
u.s. is still quite a bit over the MSRP
but anyway other components like the
rise and CPUs they're incredibly good
value and the supporting motherboards
they're all readily available at good
prices be 350 boards you can get one no
worries for like $70 us and you can
easily get away with 8 gigabytes of ddr4
memory for now of course if you're not
desperate
it might just pay to wait until early
next year you'll probably see better
memory prices and graphics card prices
and all that stuff early in 2018 all
right next up we have Santiago wizkid Oh
Atlas Caen you have problems with D
monetization thing of YouTube okay so do
you have monetization issues on YouTube
at the moment and what do you think
about the new policy of Activision about
matching marketing so that would be the
micro transaction based matchmaking
system
I think the Activision was micro
transaction based matchmaking system
yeah pretty dumb idea that's pretty
insane I can't see that playing out too
well for them but yeah I haven't looked
into it too much and don't have yet much
more to say on it I do have to say on
the YouTube D monetization I suppose
they're calling it the what is the ad
pocalypse 2.0 that's pretty much what
they're calling it on YouTube and yeah
that's definitely hurt me a bit if I
relied solely on the channel to support
my family
I'd have to say there'd be quite a few
sleepless nights so it is a bit of a
scary time at the moment for content
creators but thankfully for me anyway
that isn't the case like I said I have
many baskets with eggs in them I did
have a video I think I'm gonna be one of
the top 5 worst video
recently yeah it's not a big benchmark
video but a lot of work and effort and
editing all that kind of stuff research
and stuff does go into those videos so I
spent quite a bit of time on it and I
did receive a hundred thousand views on
the first day so for our channel or my
channel it's a huge success
fortunately though I didn't get a single
dollar for that video so yeah that
sucked the video now is about a hundred
and forty thousand views I think it is
and it's made me about twenty four
dollars us so yeah that's why they call
me mad money stacks $24 the YouTube
climate is very volatile right now the
views are down sub growths down and all
those all that stuff's just massively
slowed down and thankfully though it's
not just for my channel pretty much all
smaller YouTube channels and to say
500,000 subscribers the tech channels
that I sort of follow on that they sort
of seem to be seeing the same kind of
slowdown so hopefully that picks up soon
but yeah not much I can do about it so
I'll just keep plotting along pumping
those videos out and hopefully YouTube
starts pushing them again soon for us
next up we have Bernie Inge at E Bernie
what's the relationship between techspot
and harbor are boxed was an avid reader
of text but before age of YouTube okay
that's a pretty good question I've been
writing for text but for at least a
decade now and I will continue to do so
for the foreseeable I do have a great
working relationship with the team at
text spot I think we're doing a pretty
good job of merging the content between
the YouTube channel and the text spot
website but basically the relationship
is iron Harbor unboxed whereas I
essentially just freelance for text spot
yeah enjoy doing both of them and we'll
continue to do so again thanks for the
question
moving on we have fangs vortex at fangs
vortex can you build me a PC
sure I can do custom however a box fan
builds if you want let me know what your
budget is next that we have Teemo for
life at dak dak master what does your
sorry why does your intro sound like
someone is flushing the toilet good
question why does it sound like that
well I suppose they could very well be
flushing a toilet who knows how they
make up those sound effects these days
yeah it's a pretty crap intro I know
Matt and I just whacked it together on
the channel or I think Matt picked it
and did the text and stuff on it I can't
really recall but yeah it's just a
pretty generic intro not a lot of
thought went into the time we weren't
really taking it that seriously it was
just YouTube with something to try and
have a bit of fun making videos if you
see our earlier videos you'll see what
we've come from but yeah it's something
I definitely plan to change I just
really haven't had time like I said I've
been pump out a video every 34 hours so
give me a break on the intro I do plan
to come up with something in the near
future that is a little less P inducing
I promise probably expect to see that
early next year might do something over
the Christmas break sit down with
someone and work something out anyway
yeah new intro will be comfy okay next
up we have to the max gamer what advice
would you give to budding tech channels
also how's your day been well first of
all days been good thanks mate just take
it easy answering a few questions as for
advice well I think probably first and
foremost would be prepared prepare
yourself to work hard
yeah like super hard it's incredibly
YouTube tech channels in particular it's
just incredibly competitive there's just
a sea of them now so yeah making it is
pretty hard but I mean I wouldn't say
don't do it or be discouraged by that
ideally though you just want to start it
as a hobby something you just do is a
bit of fun probably you know instead of
maybe playing some games work on your
tech channel so it's probably a more
construct
you see a time still play some games but
ya may cut it into your gaming time as
what I'm trying to say and yet hopefully
it eventually evolves into something
that can become full-time and can
support yes oh that is obviously the
ultimate goal that'd be nice
still working on that the number one
thing though is ya can't stress this
enough don't do it for money
there's realistically very little money
to be had yeah like I said before unless
you get close to a million subscribers
more than a million subscribers you're
not really doing that well on YouTube or
at least that's been my experience so
far and also just don't do it for the
free hardware I know it seems cool
getting all this hardware and stuff but
yeah it's kind of like just it becomes
your tools to do your job so sort of how
I look at it now it's not hey look I've
got an awesome new GT X 1080 Ti or
whatever it's I've got a new graphics
card for testing I still get excited
about half the passion for it but you
know what I mean it's the same sort of
thing when guys watch me do unboxing
boxes I've got a massive unbelievably
huge pile of boxes I've got to get
through here and it's kind of exciting
to get into them but at the same time
it's like well I then have to do things
with them make builds and stuff and you
guys are sitting there thinking all that
sounds terrible you have to build some
pcs with it but like anything when
you've done it a million times it sort
of loses a bit of its magic for example
I've got you know sitting right here a
motherboard from MSI and I have to use
this and a few builds and do a few
things with that to keep MSI happy so
yeah and there's mountains of things
I've got to do so yeah it's a job but
like I said I put a lot of hours into it
it's a lot of fun so I'm not complaining
or anything I love doing it obviously
which is why I do do it yeah just don't
do it for the free hardware I definitely
don't do it for the money do it because
you love it and you like playing with PC
hardware it's really all the advice I
have all right to stop me from droning
on with the answer in question part of
the questions we have Hugo at Hugo TPD a
well what's it like to grow as much as
you did in a year and become one of the
MOU
reliable solid benchmark of slash
reviewers out there hmm that's very nice
question well before I can answer that
yet firstly thank you very much that's
really nice to hear yeah that's really
nice it's been great to see the
subscriber base just explode it's been
like five times I guess in the last it's
grown by five times in the last 12
months and I think the best part of that
is just having so many more of you to
interact with and discuss videos with
and topics and things like that so yeah
it's been good
as for the becoming a reliable source
yeah I really do my best to provide the
most accurate and unbiased information
and results and stuff that I possibly
can
I'm definitely proud of the work that
I've done on the channel this year but
you know as always there's still areas
and things I want to improve on the fact
that so many of you guys leave you know
positive comments and support and stuff
that really does encourage me and help
me keep me pumped up to keep delivering
those big benchmark videos I guess is
what I'm trying to say so yeah
big thank you to you guys again I really
appreciate all the support on that note
thank you to everyone who asked
questions I was quite shocked by how
many of you actually replied I wasn't
sure there be that many of you but yeah
big thank you they were a heap more that
I didn't get to and you guys keep asking
questions all the time on that Twitter
thread so yeah if this is something you
guys enjoyed watching sort of me
rambling on answering questions then let
me know and I'll do it on a regular
basis and probably try to do it a bit
more yeah work it out a bit more before
I get into it and maybe make it a Sunday
special or something beer if you enjoyed
it let me know if you didn't also let me
know you guys will anyway I suppose if I
did make it a more of a regular thing it
might be a good idea to pick like five
tech related questions maybe five or
less personal channel related questions
and then maybe just five around and
questions like what kind of toppings do
I like or don't like on Pizza of course
if you did enjoy the content like I said
let me know in the comments below I'll
gauge the response and
we'll just go from there like we always
do anyway it's been a mega year so far
of course there's still more to come
it's we're not at the end of the year
yet and yeah again either late this year
or early next year team will be coming
on board full-time to help out with the
workload and that's just going to be
amazing I think it's going to really
help take the channel to the next level
so that's it for this one I'm your host
Steve thanks for all your questions I'll
see you again soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
