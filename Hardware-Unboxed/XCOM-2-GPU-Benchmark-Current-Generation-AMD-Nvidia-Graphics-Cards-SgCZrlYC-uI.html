publish a 2k games release the heavily
anticipated
XCOM - last Friday February 5th XCOM -
is a turn-based tactical video game and
unlike most titles we come across it's a
PC exclusive game being solely
distributed through Steam
it's an okapi PC port here you can
expect smooth sailing and a well
optimized experience
free of bugs ah not so much so far XCOM
- has been unfortunately plagued with
random crashes startup problems
performance issues than other general
errors currently the steam discussions
board is full of gamers complaining
about all these issues and for my own
testing I've run into a few crashes
though performance overall seems quite
good having said that there are few
oddities here framerate seemed to jump
around pretty wildly but not in the way
they do in save rise to the Tomb Raider
strangely the cutscenes are frame capped
even with facing disabled and with rocky
gtx 980ti some are even locked at 30fps
therefore we avoided these completely
when benchmarking thankfully those the
over-the-shoulder camera scenes that are
features throughout the game aren't
frame caps the first mission of the
single-player campaign was used for
testing titled sabotage Advent Monument
the test runs for 120 seconds and in
that time we get a good mix of different
scenes we decided to use the maximum
in-game quality settings with FXAA
selected in favor of MSAA times 8 this
offers a better balance of performance
and image quality at 1440p with a gtx
980ti using the maximum quality settings
the cutscenes don't even maintain a 30
FPS average
and often hover in the low 20s granted
these teams do force MSAA times aid the
performance is still shocking on such a
high-end graphics card I mean let's be
honest this isn't a visually stunning
game that is what the XCOM games are
about finally benchmarking takes place
at the standard
resolutions we always test that being
1080p 1440p and 4k the performance at
1080p isn't bad considering the games
maxed out although that said when
compared to other games I've tested
recently I'm not sure the visuals can
even be compared the Ono 380 and GTX 960
are not able to deliver an average of 60
fps and rather an r9 390 s required
which I must say is very surprising
beyond that the rest of the field
average well over 60 fps with the GTX
970 and 993 90 X never dipping below 60
fps jumping up to 1440p crashes the r9
380 and gtx 960 as both averages 26 fps
and would drop down to 22 FPS at certain
times only the gtx 980ti was able to
break the 60 FPS barrier though it would
drop down to low 50s at times -
unbelievably as a 4k results show almost
the same performance we saw when testing
these cards and rise of the Tomb Raider
those wanting to play X come to at 4k
will either require insane GPU firepower
will have to be content with heavily
reducing the quality settings honestly
I'm pretty shocked by how demanding XCOM
2 is I hate to throw around buzz phrases
like not optimized or poorly coded but
given the performance numbers we've just
seen coupled with a relatively
unimpressive graphics it's hard to draw
any other conclusion not just that but
the game's horrible stability really
makes you question his current condition
and that's really a shame for a piece of
the only title initially I plan to
include a heap of image quality
comparisons and more in-depth testing
using a range of presets but given the
game's current state I felt was best to
wait until the games have been patched
to fix the various bugs and performance
issues if I'm honest XCOM - isn't really
my type of game so I won't comment too
much on the gameplay however it seems
like the games does at least deliver
when it comes to this aspect as its
received overwhelmingly positive reviews
from both professional reviewers and
gamers alike
