a few days ago we did check out the core
i7 87 ROK and found to be very mighty
granted it is a little more than a 7700
k with two additional cause and some
extra l3 cache but that's really all I
was expecting from this release anyway
well not radically different it's
certainly still very fast and it does
take things to the next level I'm
certainly not saying it's an upgrade
option for those currently using a 77
okay for example certainly not but it is
a step forward in terms of performance
that said it's also very expensive at
three hundred and sixty dollars u.s. and
right now by owning one on sale is
extremely difficult so you may have a
challenge getting one this year anyway
since three hundred and sixty dollar
CPUs are on everyone's radar I hit up
the guys over at PC case gear and begged
them to take my money in exchange for
some coffee like core i3 CPUs ahead of
the release they okayed it with Intel
and I've got the CPUs the day before
they went on sale so you can thank PC
case gear for the timely review before
we jump into the battery of benchmarks
I've got lined up for you guys let's
quickly talk specs currently priced at
$180 u.s. the core i3 8350 K is almost a
rebadged Core i5 7600 K
they're both 14 nanometer quad cores
operating around 4 gigahertz but where
is the 7600 K cost 240 dollars the a 350
K is 25% cheaper and could possibly be a
little bit faster thanks to a larger
three megabyte level 3 cache so when
compared to the core i5 7600 K consumers
are essentially getting a little more
for a little less with the 8350 k then
we have the core i3 8100 frame much more
appealing $120 us locked at 3.6
gigahertz it should be comparable to the
core i5 7400 or 7500 it also has the
same 6 megabyte level 3 cache but it's
roughly 40% more affordable whereas the
core i3 8350 K is priced to compete with
the risin 5 1500 X the 8100 takes on the
rise in 3-series the only disadvantage
the lock daddy 100 part faces right now
is the complete lack of budget
motherboards
Xen 370 boards currently
one hundred and twenty dollars whereas
be three fifty boards can be had for as
little as sixty dollars I'm also
interested to see how the a350 compares
to the core i5 8400 the six core Core i5
is just $10 more I think I'd rather the
two extra cores for such a small
increase in price rather than the
ability to overclock but as always let's
look to the benchmarks since the core i3
8100 is a locked part you'll ideally
want to feature it on a cheaper
motherboard than the current said 370
boards for now though the options are
limited and this means anyone buying an
eighth generation Core processor will
have to pair it with a Zed 370 board
though the advantage of that means that
you do have unlocked memory frequencies
on the upcoming B 360 boards for example
you will be limited to ddr4 2400 so I've
decided to test the i3 8100 using both
ddr4 2400 and 3200 memory here we see
when using ddr4 2400 memory that the
8100 is limited to a memory bandwidth of
twenty eight point six gigabytes per
second increasing the memory speed to
3200 boosts the balance by 25% and this
will no doubt a performance in a number
of games and applications meanwhile the
unlocked and higher clocked a 350 K was
tested using ddr4 3200 memory and it
managed thirty six point eight gigabytes
per second of memory bandwidth moving on
the Cinebench r15 we see the core i3 81
who is able to outpace the Rison three
1,300 and both these single and
multi-threaded tests so based on that
it's probably going to be a bit of a
rough ride for the heavily cut-down
Verizon series the 83 50 K based on its
frequency should be around 10% fast
nearly 100 but here we see it delivering
an 18% advantage the only possible
explanation being that the 33% increase
in level 3 cache capacity helps in this
test regardless though while it does
smoke the Rison 5 1500 X's single thread
score it was 16% slower for the
multi-threaded test so based on this I
expect the 83 50 K to punish the 1500 X
in most of the games but it will trail
in the productivity tests or at least
most of the productivity tests I should
note that the 83 50 K only just beats
the core i5 7600 K while is 23% slower
than the core i5 8400 before we get into
the more serious
real-world applications I should have a
quick look at the PC mark 10 scores the
83 50k actually manages to outscore the
core i5 8400 here while the 8100 beats
the horizon 3 1,300 X as well as the r5
1,500 X the core i3 8100 was also 5%
faster when using ddr4 3,200 memory
opposed to the 2,400 stuff so not a huge
margin but a small boost nonetheless
moving on to the Excel Monte Carlo
simulation we fight the core i3 8350 K
is actually much slower than the risin 5
1,500 X 24 percent slower in fact it was
also 9 percent slower than the 7600 K
and 19 percent slower than the 8400 the
core i3 8100 has much more like as it
was 18% faster than the Rison 3 1300 X
and 26% faster than the old core i3 7350
K it's also worth noting that here the
faster ddr4 3,200 memory didn't actually
offer the 8100 an advantage in this
application next up we have the
veracrypt results and here the risin 330
100x actually pulled ahead of the core
i3 8100 albeit by a slim margin
meanwhile the core i3 83 50k roughly
matched the 7600 K but was much much
slower than the core i5 8400 32 percent
slower in fact that said it was also 40%
slower than the horizon 5 1500 x so the
83 50k gets a bit host in this
application jumping into the 7-zip data
we see that again the 83 50k just can't
live with the r5 1,500 X although this
time it was only 4 percent slower for
the compression workload but it was 25%
slower for decompression the only 350 K
also gets completely annihilated by
Intel's own 8400 the Core i5 CPU was 35%
faster the core i3 8100 looks much
better and is able to tackle the rise
and 3 lineup without much of an issue
given that we have seen previously the
risin 1500 X matching the core i5 7600
our premiere pro CC workload
I knew the 83 50k would be pretty close
that said though it is a little slower
at trails the r5 1500 X by 7 percent
margin meanwhile the i3 8100 does
comfortably beat its nearest competitor
the r3 1300 X by 10% margin so again the
core i3 8100 looks quite impressive out
of the box though the
350k isn't nearly as impressive and
again it is much slower than the
slightly more expensive 8400 25% slower
in fact moving on to blender using the
Verizon graphic 27 workload we see it
the core i3 8100 easily beats the r3
1300 ex completing the task 11% faster
meanwhile the AE 350 K was 5% sold in
the risin v 1500 X and that margin will
likely remain once both CPUs are
overclocked and we'll look at that a
little bit later on in the video it's
also worth noting the core i5 8400 was
32% faster than the 83 50k Corona takes
full advantage of SMT it seems and here
the horizon 5 1500 X is almost able to
match the core i5 8400 and as a result
is almost 30% faster than the 83 50k
good luck removing that margin when
overclocking meanwhile the core i3 8100
was able to edge out the rise in 3 1300
X though I suspect with a little more
tinkering the rise in CPU might be able
to claim the lead here when testing with
povery we see that the core i3
8350 km rise in 5 1500 X are again very
evenly matched and I suspect that will
remain true once both are overclocked to
the max as well the 83 50k was 20%
slower than the core i5 8400 and I doubt
it can make up that margin through
overclocking meanwhile the core i3 8100
beat the horizon 3 1300 X with ease and
again there's no way that the AMD CPU
will make up that margin it's roughly a
20 percent deficit through overclocking
moving on to the gaming benchmarks with
battlefield 1 please note all the
testing here was conducted using Vegas
64 liquid-cooled since we're mostly
focusing on direct x12 performance my
upcoming Core i5 8400 review will again
feature both the GTX 1080 and Vegas 64
graphics cards so hang tight for that
starting with the core i3 8100 we see
that the fast ddr4 3200 memory boost the
average frame rate by 10% and that was
enough to overtake the stock r5 1500 X
even with ddr4 2400 memory the 8100 was
still 8% fast on the rise in 3 1,300 X
meanwhile the higher clocked a 350 K
does very well maxing out the Vegas 64
liquid-cooled graphics card at 1080p
using the ultra quality settings
moving on we have ashes of the
singularity escalation and this time the
horizon 3 1300 X gets dominated by the
core i3 8100 even with the slower ddr4
2400 memory the 8100 was 21% faster than
the r3 1300 X then once we paired the
8100 with ddr4 3200 it was able to match
the r5 1500 X the 8350 K streets further
ahead and was able to match the heavy
batch result of the horizon 516 hoe and
rise in 7 1700 CPUs when testing with
civilization 6 the core i3 8100 with
it's faster ddr4 3,200 memory was 5%
faster for the average frame rate and 9%
for the minimum so while using ddr4
2,400 memory will limit the 8100 2003
1200 light performance faster memory
does give it an edge at least when
compared to rise ins out of the box
performance the r3 1300 X was still
slightly faster and not much slower than
the ad 350 K in this game meanwhile the
r5 1500 X was considerably faster than
the 83 50k finally we have f1 2017 in
here the core i3 81 her using the ddr4
2400 memory was 13 percent faster than
arisin 3 1300 X in just 3 percent slower
than the r5 1500 X increasing the memory
speed allowed the 8100 to beat the r5 15
her ex by a very convincing 7% Marg and
33 50 K was a further 5% faster as it
matched the 7600 K but that meant that
it was still 9 percent slower than the
core i5 8400 the power consumption
figures are the coffee-like core i3
processors are quite good
the 8100 for example is comparable to
the Rison 3 1300 X while the 83 50k
consumed a little more than the r5 1500
X placing it on par with the r5 1600 so
not amazing results but certainly not
bad either
previously when testing with the core i7
8700 K I was able to get to an
incredible 5.2 gigahertz using just one
point 4 volts on the MSI god-like
motherboard using the same motherboard
to overclocked the 83 50k I was only
able to reach 4.9 gigahertz and that did
require 4.2 volts to stabilize the
overclock despite trying various voltage
settings I couldn't get the system to
even booting the windows at 5 gigahertz
without crashing it has been suggested
that Intel may have cherry-picked the
review sample chips and that's why most
reviewers such as myself man
to get to five gigahertz or better with
a reasonably tame voltages I'm yet to
get my hands on a retail 8700 K but when
I do I'm keen to see how it goes
anyway it was disappointing to fight the
80 350 K hit a wall at 4.9 gigahertz
that has to be said that's still quite
an impressive overclock this overclock
did boost the Cinebench r15
multi-threaded score by 12% though that
wasn't really enough to match the stock
r5 1500 X in this test meanwhile though
overclocked in the 1500 X did increase
its score by a further 13% the
overclocked a 350 k was able to close in
on the overclocked Rison v 1500 X and
the blender tests but ultimately still
loses out even at 4.9 gigahertz the core
i3 CPU also runs much hotter despite
having a far better all-in-one liquid
cooler strapped on finally here's a look
at the power consumption figures once
overclocked to 4.9 gigahertz and we can
see at the a350 K is a fair old power
because it sucks down as much juice as a
6-quart 80 700 K when compared to the
risin 5 1500 X which push system
consumption almost 20% higher once
overclocked the 8350 K jumped on the gas
pedal and sucked down 40% more juice
needless to say efficiency goes right
out the window when overclocking this
chip and said though you're probably
better off aiming for lower voltages
it's a four point eight or maybe even
four point seven gigahertz and this is
the approach I took recently when
overclocking intel's monstrous 16 and 18
core parts alright time for some price
versus performance scatterplots
I'm gonna be looking closely at the
premier cronin f1 2017 results so let's
get into it
please note I'm using the core i3 80
100's ddr4 3200 data since you can only
buy a Zed 370 board right now and this
will make even more sense in a moment so
here we are the premier price versus
performance scatterplot and it looks all
Intel here drawing a line from the core
i3 8100 to the core i5 8400 we see that
those two provide the best value beating
the 1300 X 1500 X and 1600 processors
quite easily however what happens if we
factor in the motherboard price we now
know that the cheaper said 370 board
still cost 120 dollars us while a
typical be 350 board will set you back
$70 us though there are
few models that are selling for as
little as six dollars us but let's use
$70 as our point of reference adding
those two prices to the appropriate CPUs
this is what you get well that certainly
looks more competitive doesn't it here's
the linear line as a reference point
between the risin three 1300 X and r5
1600 as you can see the 1500 X also sits
tightly on the line while the Intel Core
i3 8100 and i-5 8400 and just on the
wrong side making them slightly poorer
value options once you factor in the
price of the absolute cheapest ab 370
boards next up we have the corona
results and here the risin 516 hundred
and fifteen hundred x looks far more
competitive when just factoring in the
CPU cost again it's the core i3 8100 and
i-5 8400 that looked the most impressive
while the a350 K is almost often
no-man's land in comparison throwing up
our orange line we see that it is indeed
very close between the AMD and Intel
CPUs just mentioned but what if we
factor in the price of entry-level
motherboards doing that turns the
scatterplot red at least where it counts
and even the risin 7 1700 stacks up
pretty well drawing a line from the
horizon 3 1300 next to the r5 1600 also
again intersects the 1500 X and we see
that with the motherboard cost factored
in Rison is a much better value
proposition for these productivity
workloads now this data here by no means
represents all games but I feel like the
results are pretty typical for that of a
CPU intensive DirectX 11 title Rison is
typically more competitive in modern
DirectX 12 games as we saw with the
results just shown but keeping that in
mind let's see how f1 2017 pans out
drawing a line from the core i3 8100 to
the i-5 8400 we see that these two are
the best value options in Intel sub $200
Coffee Lake line up and they are
considerably better value in this game
when compared to Verizon even with the
motherboard pricing factored in until
remains comfortably ahead and while
Rises performance is respectable it's
really not comparable to the core i3
8100 and Core i5 8400 in terms of value
though once again the a350 K is pretty
poor in this comparison though it's
priced to performance
is quite similar to the r3 1300 X now
it's time to discuss a few thoughts and
make a couple of recommendations I'm
aware that in the previous scatter plots
that we just looked at I didn't factor
the price of a cooler for the core i3
8350 K into the equation and that will
hurt it's already weak value even more I
don't think we need to get into it too
much more though the a350 K is pretty
poor in terms of value even if you do
consider it's overclocking capabilities
and they're very least you do have to
buy a $20 cooler as it doesn't come with
one at all and you're not hitting 4.9
gigahertz on a budget cooler I was up
around 90 degrees with the 240
millimeter all-in-one liquid cooler so
expect around maybe 4.5 gigahertz with a
basic air cooler that's only a 12 and a
half percent bump over the stock
frequency so you'll really be lucky to
extract 10 percent more performance from
that overclock at best it will match the
core i5 8400 well costing more consuming
more power and running much hotter so
the core i3 83 50k really is a worthy
successor to the 73 50k it don't suck
equally but hey at least my Matt Greg
over at science geo can finally upgrade
his box cutter I'm sure a 4 core model
will have him opening boxes faster than
ever before the core i3 8100 on the
other hand is a bit special at 120
dollars and it's almost arisin 3 killer
I say almost because right now we're
missing one key ingredient affordable
motherboards it appears that Intel won't
be releasing H 370 H 310 or B 360
motherboards till the first quarter of
2018 only is it then that we will
receive sub $100 motherboards and the
core i3 8100 can truly shine as a budget
offering as good as it is sticking a
$120 CPU on a 120 dollar motherboard
doesn't really make that much sense
rather right now I'd opt for a Rison 3
1200 slap it on a be 350 motherboard and
overclock it to at least 3.0 gigahertz
while crossing your fingers for 4
gigahertz the core i5 8400 though is a
seriously tempting option and I'll cover
that in a bit more detail in another
video soon for now those after a budget
set up for productivity tasks the Rison
3 and 5 series processors on a be 350
board a bed of
and the way to go on my opinion there as
fast or faster for the most part and
they cost less if you're a gamer on a
budget the core i3 8100 looks great
it just needs to be complemented by some
more or four little motherboards and
well that's gonna do it for this one
you guys enjoyed my second pass at
coffee-like and stay tuned because the
core i5s are coming up next I'm your
host Steve see you again soon
