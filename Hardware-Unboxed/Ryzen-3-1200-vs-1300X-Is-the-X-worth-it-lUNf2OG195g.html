one of the most commonly asked questions
was should I buy the risin 5 1600 or the
1600 X typically the X model which
sounds much cooler costs around 20 to 30
dollars us more but is it as cool as it
sounds my advice to viewers at the time
was to opt for the cheaper non ex model
which includes the really nice race
stealth box cooler whereas the 1600 X
doesn't actually come with a cooler at
all despite costing more the X models
are said to be bin ships and that's how
the added price is justified but I've
found that many of them 9x models
overclocked just as well and not all X
models will hit the expected 4 gigahertz
frequency anyway that said I've got two
1600 and two 1600 X chips on hand right
now and all four run happily at 4
gigahertz using 1.37 5 volts with ddr4
3,200 memory so if you plan to overclock
the non ex model in my opinion is the
way to go and I'd certainly encourage
any of you thinking of overclocking of
thinking of buying a rising processor to
definitely overclock it especially given
how easy it is and you will see greatly
improved performance the situation with
the new Verizon 330 100 X and 1200 is a
little different here there is a rather
large discrepancy in the XR frequencies
and that's the extended frequency range
mode for those wondering where is the
1600 X clock up to 5 percent higher than
the 1600 the 1300 X can operate up to 13
percent higher than the 1200 the
difference in the base clocks isn't that
extreme but for gaming the XFR frequency
will make more of a difference that said
the 1300 X does cost 18 percent more
than the 1200 so in terms of price
versus performance it's not going to be
as good given at best it will only be a
little over 10% faster the 1300 X does
however come with the same box cooler as
the 1200 so a better option than the
1600 X in that regard so if you're not
going to overclock then the 1300 X is a
decent value option however as I said
earlier rising overclocking is dead easy
and if you want
in this video you should be resourceful
enough to figure it out we're certainly
not talking about extreme overclocking
here either chances are you only need to
change a single setting in the BIOS to
mimic 1300 X like performance with the
1200 let me show you what I mean after
loading into the BIOS you'll want to
locate the CPUs clock multiplier or
frequency option it'll vary depending on
your motherboard but we labeled
something like that in the case of the
Azeroth boards you want to never get to
the second tab titled OC Tweaker then
you want to set the CPU frequency and
voltage change option from auto to
manual here you'll see that the CPU
frequency value is shown in megahertz
and it's set to 3100 by default simply
change this figure from 3100 to say 3700
and now all the calls will be running at
3.7 gigahertz effectively making the
1200 now faster than the 1300 X so this
overclocked no other settings need to be
changed that's it simply save and exit
the system will reboot and load into
Windows with the CPU now running all
course at 3.7 gigahertz a quick check
with Cinebench r15 and we see the 1200
is now indeed faster than a stock 1300 X
as it can now produce a multi-threaded
score of 572 points
it's almost a 30% increase overstock and
an 11% increase over the stock 1300 X
pretty good for around 30 seconds worth
of tinkering I reckon also keep in mind
this can all be achieved without
spending any additional money on a
special motherboard for example a basic
be 350 board will do and the AMD race
stealth box cooler can easily support
this overclock additionally you could
also achieve this overclock using AMD's
rise and master software within Windows
and it works very well but I find the
bios method quick and easy so as you can
see there really is no need to spend
that extra $20 us on a 1300 X if you're
willing to be a teeny tiny bit tech
savvy anyway it's not a seriously big
deal either way but saving a bit here
and there on a budget build really can
help I'd rather spend that money for
example somewhere where it can make a
noticeable difference like getting a
faster GPU or maybe a bigger SSD
something along those lines anyway
that's going to do it for this one if
