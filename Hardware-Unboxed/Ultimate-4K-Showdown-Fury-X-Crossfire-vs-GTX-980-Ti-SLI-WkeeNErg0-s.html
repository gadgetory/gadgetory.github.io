your host Matt and today we have in hand
a pair of fury exes and a pair of 980 t
is for some crossfire this SLI action
game is keen to enjoy that ultrasharp 4k
image quality are going to require Lisa
fury acts or 980 TI however to ensure
smooth playable performance you're
probably going to need two of these
monster GPUs because both SLI and
crossfire performance is entirely
dependent on driver support testing with
just a few games wouldn't really paint
an overall picture of the performance
therefore we've cracked out over 20 of
the latest titles to see which pair of
cards really delivers the best 4k
experience for a full list of the test
system specs please check the video
description below first up ARMA 3
benefited slightly from multiple GPUs
and performance was pretty even from
both teams in terms of frame time those
the 980 TI was slightly better as a
single cards in the fury axe even in
crossfire Assassin's Creed unity was a
lot faster in both multi-gpu setups with
the fury axe in crossfire taking the
scalp the 980 TI in sli did have
slightly better frame times although the
difference was pretty negligible in
battlefield 4 performance is pretty even
across the board and multi-gpu
technologies scaled well for both camps
for frame time the fury axe in crossfire
was the clear winner at just 13.5
milliseconds cod advanced warfare
coupled with the 980 TI SLR setup had a
much higher minimum frame rate compared
to the fury action crossfire although it
both were very high frame time scores
were all pretty similar within a couple
of milliseconds of each other save for
the 980 TI single card set up the 980 TI
is in sli with clear winners in
civilization particularly in terms of
minimum frame rate yes a liar
configuration also got the not in terms
of frame time taking just sixteen point
six milliseconds between frames crysis 3
it was another even fight with virtually
identical results across the board in
average frames and minimum frames the
fury axe in crossfire however was the
best performer in terms of frame rate at
just 27 point 9mm
both multi-gpu technologies scout at
well in dragon age inquisition with the
980 TI is getting the slight edge
crossfire led the pack again in terms of
frame time at just 16 point nine
milliseconds the 980 TI seemed to suit
down lights demands with a decent
advantage in both single and multi GPU
configurations this advantage continued
in the frame time realm but the fury ax
is much more consistent in crossfire
mode performance is quite even across
the board in f1 2015 with multi-gpu
technology even though neither aimed in
Noren video support their multi-gpu
technologies in F 1 2015 yet we still
included it as it is a good example of
what happens in games that don't yet
have driver support as you can see due
to the lack of driver support single
card configurations of it's slightly
better performance these results would
provide a purely out of interest and we
won't factor them into our overall
results far cry 4 prefers the fury ex
both in single card and multi-gpu
configurations this was consistent with
our frame time results too with the fury
a crossfire configuration delivering the
best results just 14.2 milliseconds GTA
5 benefits from the multi card configs
with pretty healthy framerate boosts in
both instances and the SLI 980 TI was
six to seven frames faster than the fury
axe and cross fire again these results
were pretty consistent in terms of frame
time but there wasn't a significant
difference with any configuration grid
Autosport loves the 980 TI it was able
to edge out the fury x in crossfire mode
with just a single card that said sli
wasn't a heap better than the single
card performance either again these
results were consistent in the frame
time scores too with the single 980 TI
beating out our crossfire configuration
crossfire produced awesome results in
hitman edging out the 980 TI and sli by
quite a few frames in terms of frame
time whether the SLR compu produce the
best results of 19.6 milliseconds metro
redux benefits from multi-gpu setups the
980 TI edge data crossfire in terms of
average frames but the minimum frame
rate was lower crossfire produced the
lowest frame time score as well so you
best playing experience will probably be
with this setup middle-earth was
significantly faster with multi-gpu
and both camps are quite evenly matched
with the 980 TI is offering a higher
minimum frame rate the SLI setup also
offered much lower frame time at 26.6
milliseconds compared to 46.1 it's well
known that AMD has performance problems
of project cars and as you can see one
of those problems is crossfire scaling
single card performance is pretty weak
as well frame times are also poor from
the fury acts in both crossfire and
single card configuration multi-gpu set
up significantly boosted Sleeping Dogs
performance with crossfire fury axe is
edging out the 980 TI and sli on average
although the Nvidia set up had a higher
minimum frame rate frame times were very
even apart from the single fury apps
config which suffered a little both
teams are pretty even in the witcher 3 a
multi-gpu setups made to gave a lot more
playable crossfire was the clear winner
in terms of frame time a thirty eight
milliseconds compared to 57.8 from the
single card 980 TI and 58.9 in sli thief
loves crossfire and crossfire love steve
it wiped the floor with sli and
delivered 69 frames per second on
average although the minimums were quite
close friend times told the same story
with much better scores from the fury
acts in crossfire performance was pretty
similar in Tomb Raider between both
teams with the 980 TI is coming out just
on top this was repeated in terms of
frame time with the ethyl I set up
coming in at 19 point nine milliseconds
crossfire was a big winner in total war
11 frames better on average and an 11
frame better minimum frame rate
crossfire was also much better in terms
of frame time with 28.4 millisecond
score compared to 44.6 from the sli set
up crossfire one is gaining watchdogs
with 77 points for second on average and
a minimum frame rate of 65 the 980 TI is
in sli had better frame home so ever at
19.6 milliseconds performance would be
great regardless of whether you choose
the fury axe or the 980 TI out of the 21
games we tested which excludes f 1 2015
we found on average that those the
crossfire and SLR configurations
delivered the same average frame rate
performance when looking at the minimum
frame rates on average the fury X cards
of six percent slower and four percent
slower
comparing frame times so even though
performance as much the same if we had
to pick a winner it would be the gtx 980
TI the 980 TI wasn't just faster when
comparing minimum frame rates and frame
times but also consumed up to 100 watts
less power whilst doing it and also
don't forget you can get a little over
10 percentage of performance through
overclocking still whichever way you go
it's great to see both AMD and NVIDIA
doing a great job of supporting latest
titles allowing for some truly
impressive 4k performance this has been
