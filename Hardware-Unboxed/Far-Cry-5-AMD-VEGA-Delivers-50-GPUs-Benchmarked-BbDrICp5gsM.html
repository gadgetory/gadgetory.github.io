benchmark video today we are checking
out the hotly anticipated far cry 5 now
I'm not going to talk too much about the
game itself in this video rather focus
will be on framerate performance just
quickly though the game has been
developed and published by Ubisoft and
despite the name it's actually the 11th
installment in the Far Cry series though
it is the fifth installment in the main
series before we get into the benchmark
results though today's video has been
sponsored by a Corsair and their
impressive new range of Hydro series all
in one liquid coolers the new pro models
are available with either a 280
millimeter or 360 millimetre radiator
and both deliver exceptional performance
with an almost silent operating volume
for more information please check the
link in the video description as
expected the game uses the junior engine
which is a modified version of the cry
engine used by several titles in the Far
Cry series already in the past this
engine has had issues with textures
popping in and unfortunately I have
already noticed quite a bit of this one
using high-end GPS from both AMD and
NVIDIA so that is a bit annoying and it
does attract from the experience at
times still overall the game is visually
impressive and for an open world title
appears quite well optimised speaking of
optimization
unlike many titles these days far cry 5
doesn't have game works plastered all
over it rather this is an AMD sponsored
title though I'd consider it fairly
neutral overall the goal here certainly
doesn't appear to be handicapping Nvidia
users AMD says that they've worked
closely with Ubisoft to ensure that far
cry 5 is well optimised with excellent
visual quality high frame rates and low
latency they've still managed to support
several advanced Radeon rx Vegas
specific features such as rapid packed
math shader and strings expand Radeon
free sync to but know these features and
negatively impact GeForce users Ubisoft
recommends gamers Rock a core i7 4770k
processor along with the geforce gtx 970
or radeon r9 290x so fairly heavy
recommendations there but you can get
away with a core i5 2400 or FX 6300
along
the GTX 670 or r9 270 far cry 5 is a
DirectX 11 only title but that's not
terribly surprising given the game
engine being used here for testing AMD
supplied us with their latest Radeon
software adrenaline Edition driver
version eighteen point three point four
which is now publicly available at this
point and this is a far cry 5 game ready
driver at this point in videos yet to
release a game ready driver for this
tale so please keep that in mind and
once a driver is ready we'll update the
results if necessary benchmarking fire
cry 5 has been made easy by the fact
that there is a built in benchmark that
appears to do a very good job of
replicating the kind of performance you
can expect to see when playing the game
the benchmark pass runs for 60 seconds
and reports the minimum average and
maximum frames per second that said
though we are manually recording the FPS
performance so we can report the 1% low
frame time result rather than the
minimum frames per second figure though
the frame time data is converted into an
FPS metric far cry 5 offers for visual
quality presets titled low normal high
and ultra for testing at 1080p 1440p and
4k we're using the ultra quality preset
but I've also done some additional
testing used in the normal quality
preset with some older graphics cards in
total 50 different graphics cards were
tested so there's loads of data to go
over so let's get into it
starting with the previous generation
GPUs at 1080p we see some pretty decent
numbers from the mid-range graphics
cards the r9 390 and GTX 970 both
averaged over 60fps and despite this
being an AMD sponsored title the GTX 970
and 980 beat the Radeon competition the
fury X also looks respectable despite
the GTX 980 are offering greater
performance as expected though the r9 3d
does beat the GTX 960 by a comfortable
margin then with the lowering graphics
cards such as the r7 370 and gtx 950 for
smoother gameplay you will require a
lower quality preset but the performance
they're offering with the ultra quality
settings is still surprisingly good now
at 1440p gamers will require at least
and r9 390 or GTX 970 although not much
faster the GTX 980 and r9 390x were
noticeably smoother at times again the
fury ax hangs in there well with the GTX
ETI though we're ignoring the fact that
the Maxwell based GPU can find another
20% performance once overclocked as well
as far cry 5 played at 1440p 4k is an
entirely different story
still with the fury acts and the gtx
980ti both were able to deliver an
average of 31 fps and it wouldn't really
take that much tweaking to the visual
quality settings to achieve smooth
playable performance
moving on to these shiny new current
generation GPUs and right away we see
those rx and rx Vega optimizations that
AMD were talking about it's not that
often we see the rx 560 beating the GTX
1050 of matching the 1050 Ti but that's
the case here the RX 570 is also hot on
the heels of the GTX 1063 gigabyte while
the rx 580 configured with either eight
gigabytes or four gigabytes of vram
outpace to these six gigabyte 1060 it
gets even more interesting as we get to
the Vega graphics cards here Vega 56 can
be seen not only destroying the 1070 by
22 percent margin but also betting the
1070 TI and GTX 1080
that's an incredible result though I do
recognize that in video will no doubt
improve performance with an optimized
driver
I can't imagine they'll fine enough
though for the 1070 to match Vega 56
this also shows how Vega 56 really is
the gem of the Vega lineup the much more
expensive Vega 64 air-cooled model is
just 4% faster and the super expensive
liquid core version is just 5% faster
moving on to 1440p and we see it the GTX
1050 - I had anything below it such as
the rx 560 really are powerful enough to
deliver playable fonts with the ultra
quality settings the jump up to the rx 5
7 is a rather massive and again it's
only just found trailing in the GTX 1063
gigabyte I should note despite the three
gigabyte frame buffer the cut-down GTX
1060 at a great job at 1440 penis title
we saw no frame time issues the rx 580
was again able to best the six gigabyte
GTX 1060 offering 12 percent greater
performance then we see Vega 56 is again
very potent beating the 1070 1070 Ti and
even the 1080 they were more or less
matched the 1080 at this resolution here
we see the higher end of a go models
were better utilized at 1440 pair now
Vegas 64 is 13 percent faster than Vega
56 which is a decent margin you'll also
have no doubt noticed that Vegas 64
liquid managed to match the Pascal tight
necks and while it was slightly slower
than the GTX 10 80 TI when comparing the
average frame rate the one percent low
result was much the same so overall a
great result for AMD here finally at 4k
we see very playable performance from
the GTX 1080 TI Titan X and Vegas 64
liquid graphics cards the gtx 980ti is
obviously still the better value
graphics card but still a positive
result for AMD's most expensive GPU vega
56 again matched the gtx 1080 making at
21% faster than the gtx 1070 the RX 580
also meet the gtx 1060 though neither
are powerful enough to game at 4k at
least with the maximum in-game visual
quality settings enabled and well no
surprises there throwing all 33 current
and previous generation GPUs into a
single graph gives us this mess
most GPUs are able to double the player
performance at 1080p with the ultra
quality preset enabled the rx 550 and GT
1030 are really the only exceptions here
then at 1440p you'll really want the RX
517 r9 390 and GTX 970 as the bare
minimum if you want to use the ultra
quality preset that is tweaking the r9
380 for better performance wouldn't take
that much but the gtx 960 will require
some serious tuning then at 4k it's the
big guns that'll be required and while
again no surprises there vega 64 liquid
looks strong but ultimately those with
deep pockets will be after the gtx - now
you see i still if you were to imagine a
world where graphics cards sell their
MSRP vega 56 does look to offer high-end
gamers the most bang for their buck in
far cry 5 okay so now we have some of
the old bangers which i've tested using
the normal quality preset at TP here we
see the old GTX 580 with its 1.5
gigabyte frame buffer really can't get
the job done and sadly the performance
was far from playable the GT 1030 also
suffers the same fate as does the GTX
650 Ti while the GTX 950 was borderline
playable from the red team that HD 77 90
was no good along with the rx 5
50 though you should be able to get play
performance out of the r7 260x for more
optimal experience the GTX 680 7770 and
Radeon HD 7950 will be required then at
the top of the graph not that far behind
the RX 570 we find the r9 290 - ATX HD
7970 and GTX 780 Ti I really was hoping
for a greater performance uplift when
using the normal quality settings that
said while the RX 570 saw a 14% boost
the GTX 1050 - I did become 25% faster
overall at 1080p using the normal
quality preset the game is very playable
on a wide range of graphics cards before
wrapping up the benchmarks here's a
quick look at vm allocation using the
ultra quality preset at the three tested
resolutions as you can see the game
allocates around three gigabytes worth
of memory at 1080p three point five
gigabytes at 1440p and four gigabytes at
4k and I should note this is when that
amount of memory is available you'd
expect this to make the three gigabyte
1060 a stuttering mess at 1440p and 4k
but honestly it really wasn't any
different to the six gigabyte model so
that concludes our initial far cry 5
testing I have to say right out of the
gate the game looks visually impressive
and it plays very nicely for this video
I have stuck to just testing with the
presets and mostly the ultra quality
preset but there are quite a few
settings that you can play around it's
not a huge amount of tweakable settings
at least at this point but there are
quite a few visual settings on the PC
that you can tweak to better improve
performance well hopefully not
sacrificing visual quality too much
having just checked out warhammer
vermintide - and been super impressed
with how well that game ran on both Amy
and NVIDIA hardware it's great to see
another title it's well optimized for
both Radeon and GeForce owners of course
neither title is riddled with game works
features so maybe well-balanced
performance shouldn't be that surprising
next up I'm keen to throw a few dozen
CPUs at this title and of course compare
our wide range of coffee-like and rising
processors from what I've seen so far
the game looks to be pretty well
optimized for the core heavy Rison CPUs
so we should see some competitive
numbers there as I've noted a few times
in this video we will revisit the
benchmarks when in video releases a game
ready driver we
have to wait and see what kind of
performance gains will be on offer there
for now though Far Cry 5 runs very well
in video hardware but I have to say it's
the RX Vega GPUs that have impressed or
perhaps surprised the most particularly
Vega 56 it's a real shame there are more
titles that we see they gave this
competitive in and that's going to do it

for more content if you appreciate the
work we do here at harbor box then
consider supporting us on patreon I've
actually filmed a behind-the-scenes
video of making this video that will be
available for our patrons so not
terribly exciting it just shows the
process that I go through to make these
videos swapping in and out all the
graphics card and then running the
benchmark runs and all that sort of
stuff and yeah I've condensed that down
into a few minutes it's about 10 or 11
hours worth of straight benchmarking
anyway thanks for watching I'm your host
Steve I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
