another episode of unboxing boxes it is
at that time of the month where we unbox
some boxes and if you're lucky we unbox
those boxes so kind of a double unboxing
there though in the case of this one
it's just unbutton gigabyte what are you
doing I'm gonna have to I get into my
contact Alex because he's not really
playing the unboxing box's game that
well with these bubble wrap here but
anyway it's um very heavy motherboard
this one so came to check it out oh it's
definitely a motherboard so we will get
into it and take a look and for those of
you who aren't aware of what unboxing
boxes is it's just like I said an
episode that we do about once a month
where we show you guys the products that
we have on hand or the products that are
coming in sort of as we get them so that
some of these boxes have been sitting
around for a few weeks now waiting for
me to get to them so rather than just
open them a chuckle on the test bed and
do whatever I going to do with it I show
you guys the products as I get them and
there's quite a few of you that seem to
enjoy that and youtubers informed us
that if we don't do at least one
unboxing related video per month we will
lose the right to use unbox in our name
so we'll start with the bubble wrap here
but yeah really disappoint with
gigabytes effort on this one not even a
not even a satchel just bubble wrapped
anyway I'll get over it but we'll get
into it and see if we've got here at
least we have two layers of bubble wrap
so that's something
okay as many of you are probably aware
I'll get this off first as many of you
are try again as many of you are
probably aware intel released their
skylake X refresh so now it's their
ninth gen series they skipped 8th gen so
we went from the 79 80 XE to the 99th 80
XE and all you've got was a soldered Tim
that sort of it slightly improved
thermals but then it also made it worse
because everyone just D leads the 7000
series the sky like X series they just
delayed them and proved thermals
dramatically you can't do that with the
solar chips and the soldering doesn't
really help that much so it's kind of
worse anyway
motherboard manufacturers motherboard
partners have released sort of well NX
299 refresh I guess you could say
certainly wasn't gonna be the X 399 that
mess continues but anyway we we have the
new gigabyte X 2 9 horas master and
their new master motherboards
particularly from these edit 390 range
have been very impressive so we'll see
what this has in store for us TD pigs
and that sort of stuff haven't changed
for the new processors as I said they're
just soldered really that's it slight
change in price but nothing really worth
getting too excited over but base new
motherboards do look much improved
gigabyte already had quite an extensive
X 299 range they kept releasing boards
and improving them but now we have this
one the X 290 Norris master and like a
lot of these gigabyte boards with the
huge full size back plates it's very
very heavy and I can't believe what I'm
seeing here but it looks like we have a
real finned heat sinks indeed we have
two real finned heat sinks it look like
about a 6 millimeter heat pipe connects
them they're sort of I still don't
really get why they do this it's it's
got this aluminium shroud thing over it
which completely blocks the airflow
through the heatsink so definitely
reduces its effectiveness
I imagine them also be quite good anyway
yeah be disappointing that this heatsink
here looks pretty good I don't know if
there's a fan in behind there it looks
pretty blocked up so again you've got
some nice fins yeah well you guys I'll
take this off yeah it looks great nicely
with all that plastic removed so it
looks like no that's probably an RGB
cable there's a little wire sticking out
here that probably should be under there
a bit better but yeah it doesn't look
like there's a fan or anything forcing
air through there's definitely no way of
getting air through the backside or
either side of the plastic IO shroud so
yeah again airflow is gonna be pretty
limited there it's nice to see fin heat
sinks but it's a bit disappointing that
they're not a bit more practical anyway
I haven't tested it yet obviously I've
just unboxed it so if you guys are keen
I will do some VRML testing of these new
x29 on motherboards because there are a
few of them and this is obviously
gigabytes but in addition to that we
have two 8-pin connectors we have three
m dot 2 slots they've got the new
thermal guards on them I've been
thinking of doing like a roundup of
testing all the different thermal guards
of all the motherboards and seeing which
ones are rubbish if any of them work
really well so that could be something
that I will do a gigabyte is saying that
it has a 12 phase vrm and actual 12
power stage doubled up there are doubles
on the back so it's probably six PWM
signals creating it twelve phases it's
approach the only way to go there
thermal pad looks good so yeah it could
be quite a good performing board this
one nice feature set we've got wireless
AC they've got 2.5 Gigabit LAN along
with Gigabit LAN so we're starting to
see that two and a half Gigabit LAN used
a lot more on motherboards and then
you've got your sort of gigabyte RGB
lighting stuff looks like this will be
lit here it's probably some other lights
hiding all over the place and yeah I'll
fire that up at some point don't know if
I'll get it in time to show any b-roll
but that is the new gigabyte motherboard
no pricing information for either the US
or Astra
it's not available at this point in time
I don't know if anyone's reviewed it yet
but obviously I haven't but anyway
that's that we should probably move
along to see what else I've got we might
as well tuck into this big MSD box we've
got here it's very big not super heavy
but a mess I like to strap the hell out
of their box so this makes getting into
them a little bit more difficult than it
should be what would be otherwise okay
like I said big box not particularly
heavy I think it says X 299 on the side
at least that kind of gave it away we
got okay so they're just empty
motherboard boxes and that's what we've
got in there that is it okay so second
box second X 299 refresh motherboard and
this is the mega X 299 creation so we
had the X 399 creation which is pretty
much my favorite X 399 motherboard
absolute beast that thing I'm using it
in my editing rig and so's Tim so that
probably tells you how much we like
those that particular board but here is
the X 2 9 iron version same sort of
shadow glass theme which some of you
like a lot of you don't like Tim and I
don't mind it you don't really see a lot
of it when you've got it installed in
the system so it probably doesn't matter
too much but I think it's a the board
looks fine okay well a quick look at
this one of the more move on I won't go
on too much about this one not sure
about the vrm on this board is that the
board there yes
actually I'll show a little bit more of
the what you get with the card
oh sorry the motherboard this MSI do
crook provide quite an impressive
package with their godlike and crashing
and all their higher-end motherboards so
this little thing that looks like a mini
ITX graphics card is actually an m2 nvme
SSD expansion card and it looks like
this one you can expand with an
additional 4 M 2 cards so you just stick
that in your PCI Express time 16 slot
and you can go crazy with nvme drives in
this package here it looks like we have
a Thunderbolt 3 adapter yep we got to
type C's and then two of your sort of
full-size display port connectors and
that will go in a PCI Express x one slot
so Thunderbolt 3 support got some high
gain antenna and then a little bag here
which features things like your i/o
shield else we got in here looks like it
is a high bandwidth SLI bridge I know
there's just a whole heap of RGB
connectors and SATA cables and some
stickers and things so plenty of stuff
in there
and then of course we have the
motherboard some performance numbers
there probably don't need to worry about
those we'll work that out for ourselves
at a later date and here we have another
heavy X $2.99 motherboard though this
way isn't quite as heavy as the gigabyte
board is there is no full-size backplate
and it is still a big big that's a huge
motherboard extended ATX board very very
serious-looking vrm on that one don't
know if that's a 12 or 16 phase or what
it has three eight pin CPU power
connectors probably not required to
would be more than enough but we've got
three so not sure how much juice you're
planning on pumping and I'm gonna show
you power supplies have three eight pin
power connectors but anyway we've got
one two three four five six doublers on
the back yeah it looks like just six so
that's probably a 12 phase vehicle vrm
which is what gigabyte are offering so
similar the only thing I don't really
love about this board is that it's got
the same heat reservoirs the aluminium
blocks over the VAR m yeah and it's got
the same same behind the i/o panel as
well a little more airflow and once you
put the i/o shield and there won't be so
yeah that's connected by a what looks to
be a flat
six millimeter copper heat pot
nickel-plated that's probably what it is
yeah I mean it's probably gonna run
pretty cool anyway so we'll give that a
test probably have to use my 79 ATX ears
I don't have a 99 ATX II but as I said
that the same thing anyway so not really
a big deal there and it looks like an
addition to gigabit networking we have
2.5 gigabit ethernet as well and we also
have 3 m dot 2 slots again with some
sort of thermal shielding I'll have to
see how well that works that sort of
integrated into the chipset heatsink as
well the platform controller hub
heatsink a pretty cool looking board can
to give that a go as well okay just not
to heap of things off will grab it I'll
try it the big ones out of the way first
so we can clear up a bit of special true
to Corsair boxes here we'll start with
this one I suppose see what we got in
here try and do this again not looking
at anything yet I've been wanting these
looks like they got to I can't let me
hopefully one day I end up with a set
that's big enough to do these unboxing
boxes looks like they've sent me a pair
of the new h1 15 i RGB platinum all in
one liquid coolers and they're both the
two 80 millimeter version I believe yep
that is correct
so these will be for my new test systems
that I'll be building shortly or
upgrading some of the test systems that
I have ok so there's already a few
reviews floating around of these guys so
I won't go into too much detail I won't
bother unboxing or anything like that
you'll see them in future builds and
we'll probably do some testing and stuff
like that
$180 u.s. or 230 Australian so not too
bad there you know for 230 at PC case
gear and we recommend using those guys
if it can really good customer service
and yet has a 200 millimeter radiator
they've upgraded them now to have the ML
which are the magnetic levitation fans
so there you've got a pair of 140
millimeter ml fans with GB of course so
it is the new the RGB version so the
previous non platinum model had the RGB
block but not RGB fans and that's just I
don't know what I call say we're
thinking they RGB everything these days
but anyway that's that the waterblock
also has 16 embedded RGB LEDs now that
can be fully controlled using their cue
software and it supports all current
platforms I don't know Tim didn't use
one of these on each thread reveal I
think he used the H 150 I Pro from
memory anyway doesn't offer full tr4
coverage but he says it works really
well temperatures are cool and there's
no hot spots or anything like that so
yeah interesting to have a bit of a look
at that but anyway I'll move along ok
next big box would be probably I'll care
for this one I'll do this one next see
what's in here
and then we'll just have the small
package just to deal with which are a
bit easier and often just as exciting a
few of them ah awesome awesome awesome
this is definitely going to be featured
on the channel without a doubt probably
in a build but I'll also be keen to do
some vrm thermal testing with to the
2950 x so this is the new asrock phantom
gaming 6 and if you can't tell it's an
x3 99 motherboard and the point of this
one is it's meant to be an affordable x3
99 motherboard and you might be thinking
well why do you want an affordable x3 99
motherboard because it's a high-end
desktop platform people are willing to
spend a lot of money and get tons of
features and all that kind of stuff
which is true however in the case of AMD
CPUs the first generation through proper
CPUs are still on sale and they're
bloody cheap I made a video about the
1920 X over a month ago now and that
thing had dropped down to $400 us back
when I made that video it was definitely
over a month ago and today you can pick
one up on you egg Amazon flick for a
hundred and twenty dollars u.s. so
that's insane for 12 core processor of
course we do have a Zen 2 coming next
year though that'll probably be
announced at CES but it could come quite
a bit after that so hard to say there
anyway we've got the 1920 X 4 $420 UF's
which is incredible by therefore 12 core
CPU and then the 1950 X for $600 us
which is just mind-blowing value for a
16 core 32 thread CPU this board here
will only support the 180 watt TDP CPUs
which is up to the 16 core models so the
latest processor would be the 29 50 X
and really that's perfectly fine because
the higher-end models you start getting
well up over $1000 and while it would be
nice to pick up you know one of the 24
core models down the track at a
reasonably affordable price you probably
at that point better off getting
whatever's in to has to offer within
that 180 watt TDP limit so I think this
has an eight phase-- vrm not a high
percent sure on that I will have to
dig into it and take it apart and get a
better look at it it does have 2.5
Gigabit Ethernet so that's kinda nice
we're starting to see them on a lot of
other boards so hopefully we will start
to get some affordable switches or at
least some switches that - ridiculous in
terms of pricing their prior to the
release of this motherboard I think your
cheapest X 399 boards for about $300
u.s. and this one will be coming in at a
thief 250 so it might get closer to 200
but even it at 250 that's still $50 off
and when you're buying a cheap first gen
12 or 16 core processor saving at $50 is
quite important how will that sharpen
get me
soldered taps on the back so along with
the mother 1 the package we get an iron
shield we get expansion slots sort of
adapter card for Wi-Fi though I don't
see any Wi-Fi adapters that would be an
optional thing if you put one in the
m-dot - it does have an MDOT - Wi-Fi but
it isn't populated and this would be an
SLI bridge so then your manuals a couple
of em top two screws and all that
typical kind of stuff that you find in
motherboards running out of room already
so back of the board front of the board
some decent sized heat sinks down the
rear I'm not thinned thinned finned
thinned finned really only looks like it
could be a six phase erm so yeah
oh maybe you tonight I don't know yeah
I'll take it apart later and work it out
but there are no doubles on the back
side of the board
they could be on the top side I can't
see them so we'll have to take the heat
sinks off and have a better look later
but anyway it is targeting 180 watt TDP
processor so it should work fine there
and as I said it's just an affordable
board for those cheaper 12 and 16 core
CPUs basically if you're spending over a
thousand dollars up to $1,800 u.s. for
the 2990 WX then motherboard price
doesn't matter too much notice by
something like the
$3.99 creation from MSI but if you're
not after an $1,800 u.s. processor then
you probably don't want to spend five
six hundred dollars us on the
motherboard this is where this guy comes
in and it does have some really nice
features like I said it's got that 2.5
gigabit ethernet it's got decent audio
looks like we've got three m dot two
slots one of them has a thermal shield
that's kind of nice if it works well
eight SATA ports and yeah so for an x3
99 motherboard it's got a reasonable
amount of features at the $20 price
point which as I said is makes it pretty
much the cheapest x3 99 motherboard you
can buy right now unfortunately not
available in Australia just yet so I
can't give you the Aussie pricing okay
we should probably get rid of this box
cuz I've been meaning you get it the
last few goes now not sure if I'll close
it upside down or not but who cares and
get into it oh okay okay
very nice I'll get these and put a mean
okay we won't unbox these I'll just
quickly show you that I have them and
they'll probably be a review coming up
on the channel but reasonably shortly
I'll get I'll try to get onto these as
quick as I can we just reviewed the RT X
xx atti
horas extreme graphics card looked
really awesome now the cooling was
decent wasn't as good as I was hoping
for the heatsink looks amazing the
cooling looks amazing unfortunately it's
not the most amazing performing cooler
despite being one of the more amazing
looking ones so that was a bit of a
shame it wasn't terrible or anything but
yeah wasn't as good as I was hoping for
so anyway I think these have pretty much
the exact same cooler so it's probably
gonna work really well on the 27 t
decent on the 28 and then you've already
seen the 20 80 TI so that's that in a
nutshell probably just rattle off some
pricing quickly the 280 model is selling
for 860 u.s. I believe it is and we get
a bit rolled on the conversion here in
Australia it's fourteen hundred and
eighty dollars Australian
yeah and then this guy really isn't much
better
so that's $600 us the MSRP is 500 us but
you are getting that fleshy looking
cooler so you're paying a hefty premium
for a fancy light show if that's what
you want and then in Australia it's like
a thousand and forty thousand and fifty
dollars Aussie so yeah that's a bit
brutal moving right along
we'll get this guy okay very small
package ah yes I was expecting these
this is the new crucial p1 SSD and it's
an nvme SSD it is a so we got looks like
ah says it right there 1000 gigabyte we
have the one terabyte models two of
those so I'm keen to give them a whirl
these use qlc NAND memory so that is
quad layer NAND memory and that is I
haven't actually had any experiences
with it yet TLC got to the point where
it was quite reliable and so for those
of you who don't know SLC is one bit per
cell and that's pretty much the most
premium stuff you can get
you don't really come across too many
SLC SSDs there especially for sort of
consumer-grade stuff because they're
just hugely expensive then MLC which
became quite popular that's two bits per
cell TLC which is now sort of a new
Samsung Evo's my kind of stuff that
three bits per cell and then these are
four bits per cell basically the more
bits per cell the higher chances you
have of any readwrite errors occurring
the lifespan err endurance of the drive
is reduced as you are riding more per
cell and then the performance overall
can be reduced as well so yeah
interested to see how these quad Liar
SSDs perform no idea yeah we have the p1
in one terabyte and I could possibly
throw these in rate and see how they go
there maybe on one of the new x-29
motherboards as for other capacities
there is a 500 gigabyte
getting around can't recall the prices
on that sorry and I think there's a two
gigabyte version coming up as well but
that's not out yet so the one terabyte
model is probably gonna be the most
popular because it's a hundred and
seventy dollars u.s. so that's pretty
bloody cheap though it does work out to
be about $280 in Australia so not super
great by here but yeah if you're in the
US this might be a good option we'll
have to test it out and see ok we'll
deal with this one next
it's a little guy it's shrink wrapped
box cool we have a box of plastic stuff
more plus oh there we go I think it was
upside down this is wasn't really in the
middle of the plastic stuff but anyway
it looks to be perfectly intact without
a mark on it and what we have here is
another SSD another nvme SSD Gen 3 PCI
Express times 4 this is the XP g sx 8200
pro bit of a catchy name there so
apparently this is a data's fastest SSD
to date so that's quite impressive I
think it is three and a half gigabytes
per second read and three gigabits per
second right so pretty snappy there
pretty typical looking m2 SSD it has SLC
caching and there is a dram cache chip
on either side as well so that's your
cache buffer there and I have no idea
about pricing in Australia or the US for
this model because well it's not
available yet so can't comment on
whether it appears to be good value or
not but we will probably test this out
on the channel the not-too-distant
future we've got a few SSDs here I
actually have the new qlc Samsung SSD as
well so perhaps we do a little SSD
roundup ever fordable and fast SSDs and
there's a little heat shielding here if
your motherboard doesn't have one okay
the last actual box we have on hand is
this one here
and we'll double wrap we'll buy more
wrap more level that's actually alright
I know what this is now you've probably
seen quite a few other youtubers already
cover this stuff because well they're
not lazy like me and have it left it
sitting on their floor for a couple of
weeks but this is what we saw at
Computex the g.skill Royal RGB memory
and I have ddr4 4000 CL 17 memory so not
only does it look pretty bling it's
going to be ridiculously fast
I've actually been keen to get some 4000
memory to test out the coffee like a
refresh CPUs in particular the 9900 K
well I can see my reflection really well
in this it's a little bit scary so I've
got two sticks of that with a nice
little cleaning mat and then I think I'm
hoping this is the little display box
that you will have seen pile from bit
wit showed this off a while ago on his
channel he made a really cool video
about it all and it looks to be it he
got the gold and the silver it looks
like we've just got a sewer but it is
the 4000 speed which as I said I'm very
very pleased about because I want to do
some benchmarking with that we've got a
USB cable here I wonder if that's gonna
reach my stuff does that goes in there I
can put that in there as well got some
way to clean there a stall that
ah I just had to wait a minute I think
I'll plug them into the right demon swim
there's only two of them anyway there
you go my RGB memory very happy with
that so that was a bit of a surprise I
actually forgot I had that sitting there
and sorry for g.skill for not getting to
that sooner all right we have what feels
like a box in a bag and that is actually
what we have a box in a bag I have
absolutely no idea what this is at all
not a clue
sometimes I can kind of tell because who
it's been sent by or the shape of the
box but no idea what this is
five port USB smart quick charger brick
smart charger from Team Group okay
calamy and treat this is not I could
have never guessed that this would be in
here and I don't really know what this
is well it's obviously a USB charging
station type of thing okay I'm trying
oh wow that had a really good suction on
there and what do we have here it looks
like a power cord it's an Australian
power cord as well that almost never
happens so there we go
two pin power cord very good wow this
looks like something Tim would
absolutely love to have on his desk
because it looks like it is Lego
compatible it's not an official Lego
product I don't believe that's kind of
cool Wow Tim would I imagine Tim would
love this probably got the wrong person
I'm boxing it but uh yeah pretty simple
but kind of cool products so you just
plug your power in here so it's not a
USB hub at all that is merely a power
charging device yeah so it's definitely
not a USB hub like I thought it might
have been I think it said yeah it didn't
say how it all it just said five USB
port smart quick charger so you see that
wherever you want your kitchen wherever
your charge or device is whether that's
at your desk or whatever you can stick a
couple Lego men on there or integrated
into some quite a Lego thing it can
actually you can put it on top of Lego
or they go on top of it and then there's
this little canister thing which goes
underneath and you can put bits and
pieces in there cables and things and it
has via this port here that looks like
what is it Qualcomm quick charge 3.0 and
it does say it's Lego compatible weighs
250 grams one Arthur's so outputs 55
watts in total 1.3 amps max so each of
these standard USB type a ports has a
combined 8 amps across all of them it
says each can do a maximum of 2.4 though
then for the quick charge it does 3 amps
at 5 volts at 2 amps at 9 volts and then
1.5 amps at 12 volts
so yeah it's pretty cool it's a little
10 centimeter by 10 centimeter brick
this is because 6 centimeters tall and
it apparently is a product that Tim
group now sell so yeah it's kind of cool
yeah would not have ever guessed that
there was a team group Lego sort of
themed though not sure if it's an
official Lego product but it just said
leo compatible on the thing
yeah that's charger very cool I might
have to try and if I want to keep this
one I'll have to somehow keep this one a
secret from Tim so hopefully he doesn't
watch this this episode alright alright
we're getting there
we are getting there last two packages
we'll open this one up first just
because it's the closest one to me no
other reason my RGB memory is still
going strong we've got two boxes in here
ooh Plantronics headset they're always
good an icon controller I'm not that
familiar with okay so apparently the
deal here is that Nikon and Plantronics
have teamed up to create a
limited-edition sort of controller
headset combo so you can see that
they're designed to go with one another
they support ps4 or PC pcs obviously
what we're interested in and this seems
like a pretty cool combo for rocket
League players or well anyone that plays
a game on PC that requires a controller
to be enjoyed to its fullest and then of
course if you use ps4 then well you use
ps4 so I'll take a quick look at the
headset first I have a plant Ronix
headset that I use I can't remember the
exact model but I use that for when I
game and yet really really comfortable
it's one of the few headsets that
doesn't give me a bloody migraine after
a few hours of gaming so we've got a
detachable mic very nice
Shh stop making noise
alright so we have a very light weight
our headset here it's not Wireless
though so we have a connector here for
hooking that up so this little device
here is kind of cool this is the rig
game volume controlled dial I think I
got that right basically it's a volume
control dial a max volume louder or
quieter generally how they work
but the cool thing about this is
actually to show you the cool thing
about this I actually have to get the
controller out so I'll do that just
quickly okay here is the controller it
is also very lightweight it feels really
nice if you can hear a humming in the
background I do apologize my next-door
neighbor has started mowing his lawn so
yeah we'll have to put up that with that
for the remainder of this episode
hopefully it's not too loud on the
microphone but the cool thing about this
controller is it has a little headset
jack there and then this has a little
tab to keep it level or straight and it
plugs in just like that and well you
gave me if you want to adjust your
volume you just go bang like that
instead having to use the headset up
here or you know having a dial down here
where you're trying to mess around with
that you can basically just grab that
with your thumb and adjust the volume up
or down so that it's pretty neat I
really like that and then that just
connects in up here you can swivel
around there that works pretty well and
then down here we have the connection
for the microphone which is as I said
detachable quite obviously detachable
that plugs in like so and yes they are
still very comfortable like mother
Plantronics headset they hold on nice
super lightweight they don't grab your
head really hard don't crush your ears
but at the same time then hold on really
well and they come down to your
controller and the controller connects
by a USB type-c
it's probably a cable
somewhere in you here we go so yep type
C at the controller end that slots in
nicely and then you've got a type a
that'll go to your ps4 or your PC and
then there's also a little packet here
with this little key which you can use
to remove these lugs at the end of the
controller they slide out and you can
weight them so if you want to make the
control a bit heavier because without
any weights it is very light which I
quite like but if you like a bit of
weight so you can make one side heavier
than the other or however you want to do
it you can do that with the weight
system alternatively you can use these
little weights for working out as well
yeah that's about right for me
good size that one so yeah neat
controller I'm 2 by no means to control
our expert but it seems very good to me
I'll probably take this to Tim's later
this month for our QA because he loves
console gaming and I'll see what he
makes of it yes that's the Nikon
revolution at pro controller - quite a
neat device not a hundred percent sure
on the price for this one all the
headset I wasn't able to find any
pricing information and I'm not sure how
you go about purchasing them in a bundle
whether there's a discount or if they
have to be bought separately don't have
researcher on that one then lucky last
wrapping up the episode we have this
package here and inside what looks like
we have a Razer products yes we have a
Razer product and what is it what is it
Benari wireless gaming headsets okay so
the nari is razors new top-of-the-line
wireless headset and massive cans on
this thing and this is one of three
models so I suppose this is the
mid-range model the standard now so does
the nari essential which is a bit
cheaper and the ultimate which is a bit
more expensive but this is the middle
road option so we have a USB charging
cable and then if you don't want to use
it wirelessly you can use a 3.5
millimeter audio jack detachable
microphone fully swivel if you're
familiar with the other razer headsets
that feature this sort of design then
you'll be pretty familiar with what
these offer but they are wireless are
you looking at just for the model
standard model I suppose just the Denari
without anything extra added to the name
are you looking at hundred and fifty
dollars us or two hundred and fifty
Aussies so quite expensive down under
but yeah they're supposed to be the new
flagship awesome models so I will test
these out on my computer later today and
see how they go I'll be testing these
out I might even play some rocket League
or something I haven't played that game
for a very long time so I'll give you
the controller a whirl in that with a
couple of mates and it's they want to
make of that
as always I'll put links to buy or
inspect the price of any of these
products or any other details down the
video description itself you're
interested check that out yeah this was
a fun little surprise keen to give that
a go I'll probably check out in the
kitchen that's where we seem to charge
our phones and stuff for the most part
and all the kids devices you'll be
seeing I won't be reviewing this memory
because they don't really review memory
but they'll be featured in a few builds
and I'll be using it as I said to test
out the 9900 kay maybe the 9700 okay as
well with some much faster memory that
we have been so that could be
interesting so memory scaling type video
perhaps a benchmark video of some
description anyway then I will be doing
a build with this new motherboard and
you found him gaming 6x3 no you know
motherboard definitely doing a build on
that
and I'll probably do some kind of verum
test as well just to see how that goes
I don't think I'll check the 32 car on
there just to see what happens I think
I'll I'll stick to the spec put the 2150
X or whatever on to that board then we
have the new X 299 boards
probably do some sort of test with those
probably won't do a build or probably
just do a very informal test and some
overclocking whatever else you guys want
to see SSDs to check out a couple of
graphics cards over some box to myself a
whole heap of work so I probably should
wrap this episode up and it Gary get
into it not sure what I'll start with
yeah my preference is kind of leaning
towards doing a budget thread or her
build because those 1920 X and 1950 CPUs
are just amazingly good value right now
and yeah keen to check these out as well
anyway
thank you for watching this episode of
unboxing boxes I'm your host Steve and I
will see you again soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
