my investigation into how a rise in
mobile specifically the risin 5 2500 you
performs in recent games if you haven't
seen the first part of this two-part
series check that out too because it
covers popular multiplayer and eSports
titles like pub G 49 overwatch and csgo
which you know it might be interest to
you in this video however we'll be
diving headfirst into the graphics
extravaganza that is recent triple-a
titles including intensive entries like
The Witcher 3 and Assassin's Creed
origins to see if some or any of these
games can scale down to a level that's
actually playable on the integrated Vega
8 GPU here I specifically chosen to look
at more recent titles here because it's
not always obvious if these sort of
games can be played on integrated
graphics in fact I know for sure that
every game I'm looking at today is not
playable on Intel's 8th gen you serious
EPS so we're really get to see the
benefits of the Rison 5 2500 years
increased GPU power older games are less
interesting not just because they tend
to be less popular but also because most
of the time they're easier to run you
know games like Skyrim BioShock Infinite
Tomb Raider and so forth are all quite
playable and octo portables these days
so there's not much point going through
what rise in mobile brings for
five-year-old titles so we're sticking
to reasonably recent releases in this
video like part 1 all testing was done
on the HP Envy x-360 a 15 inch slim and
light laptop with the horizon 5 2500 you
inside and 16 gig of ram again there is
a faster rise of mobile trip out there
the risin 7 2,700 you but I haven't had
hands-on time with it just yet so when I
do expect an updated version of this
video with brand new data let's kick
this thing off with Grand Theft Auto 5
which I did cover briefly in my original
review of the Rison 5 2500 you as I said
in that be
Rison mobile is actually capable of
playing gta5 at 1080p which you can't
say for intel's 8th gen parts on the
lowest quality DirectX 11 preset the
game is comfortably playable with
mid-forties frame rates and the best
thing is it's smooth - so when you're
flogging around corners in a fast car
even zooming across the landscape in a
helicopter or jet there's basically no
stuttering and only the occasional brief
data streaming slow down when you're
flying in a fast vehicle while GTA 5
isn't the newest game and it was built
with last gen consoles in mind is still
surprising how well this game scales
down to relatively weak integrated
graphics it's not as good news for the
other older title I tested The Witcher 3
this game definitely does not scale well
because with the lowest possible in game
settings and even just a 720p resolution
it's completely unplayable jogging
around novigrad and frame rates were in
the low 20s and it doesn't get much
better outside the major cities to make
matters worse for The Witcher 3 on
integrated graphics the game looks
absolutely atrocious with such low
quality settings it actually is quite
surprising the game doesn't run better
considering how bad it looks
but clearly the engine has been designed
for high performance systems as it's far
from a poorly optimized game on true
gaming machines there is a chance the
game might be at least a little bit
playable on arisin 7 2700 you system
although I guess you will probably still
have to put up with the terrible visuals
a couple of other games I tested were
far from playable as well and none of
these should be a big surprise
Assassin's Creed origins is one of the
best looking games of 2017 but even on
the lowest quality settings with a 50%
resolution scale which brings the actual
rendered resolution down to just 5 for
TP the Rison 5 2500 year falls well
short of providing 30 FPS in the game's
benchmark judging by what I've seen some
areas of the game are more intensive
than the inbuilt benchmark so there's
really no hope for playing this very
recent release on rise of mobile another
Ubisoft title watchdogs - is slightly
more playable in the sense that you can
run it at 720p not 540 P but it's not a
great experience in general on the
lowest preceptor game runs below 30 fps
but it's the major stuttering that makes
this game unplayable this game is well
known to use a lot of CPU resources in
addition to the GPU and all up you know
it's too much for the risin 5 2500 you
the final unplayable game I tested is
another recent release Middle Earth
shadow of war this game
isn't the best from a gameplay
perspective but it flat-out does not run
well on the horizon 5 2500 you though
that should come as a surprise from a 27
release with decent visuals on the
lowest preset and just a 720p resolution
the game fails to reach 30 FPS in the
benchmark and runs like crap in the
actual game so give this one a Miss I
reckon it's better news for rise of the
Tomb Raider this game looks fantastic on
high-end systems but it does have the
ability to scale down to perform well
enough on the horizon 5 2500 you when
set to a 720p resolution and the lowest
possible quality settings the game does
sit above 30 fps even in the intensive
geothermal valley area the game looks
dreadful at this level of detail so it's
probably not the best way to play as
much of this game is enjoying the
beautiful visuals but I guess you can
play it on an ultra portable with rising
Mobile inside if you really want to a
game you might genuinely want to play on
rising robot is pray while this game was
released in 2017 and uses the demanding
cry engine it runs reasonably well on
the low preset with the resolution set
to 900 P when I say reasonably well I do
mean just above 30fps with a rare dip
just below in intensive situations with
a game like pray around 30 FPS is
playable and of course you can lock the
game to that framerate for a console
like experience it's not surprising prey
runs well on the rise and 520 500 you
either this is one of the better
optimized games for AMD GPU hardware
and it runs really well on powerful
systems as it's not the most graphically
demanding modern release the lowest
preset clearly cuts out enough detail
that it scales down nicely the
integrated graphics and with the slight
reduction in resolution began is
playable with some roughness around the
edges the biggest surprise in this
entire video will be Star Wars
Battlefront 2 in between designing and
implementing a complicated loot box is
still designed to ring buyers out of
every last cent and writing a
disappointing single-player campaign EA
and dice did manage to optimize the
Frostbite engine to a point where this
game runs superbly on low-end hardware
even though this game was released just
a few months ago with great visuals on
higher systems battlefront 2 is
comfortably playable on the horizon 5
2500 you set everything to the lowest
possible settings and use a 75%
resolution scale at 1080p so we're
rendering once again at 8 10 P and you
don't just sit above 30 FPS but you most
often hover in the 40 to 50 FPS bracket
now this is the ultimate battlefront to
experience as ideally you'd want to be
running at 60 fps and at a native 1080p
but the game doesn't look too bad in
upscale 810 P it certainly doesn't lose
enough detail to become unplayable and
the framerate is high enough to still be
able to slaughter foes in galactic
assault multiplayer the final game I'll
be talking about here is Civilization 6
because this is a perfect game to play
on the go as I mentioned in my initial
review of the Rison 5 2500 you this is
the first 15 watt laptop chip I've used
that provides a playable experience in
Civilization 6 set to the lowest quality
settings of 1080p
you'll get at least 35 fps in the most
intensive situations but more like 50
fps throughout most of the game as a
game that doesn't really need a high
frame rate to be playable
you can even crank up the quality
settings a little bit and sit around
that 30 FPS mark with a few nicer
effects the end result here is
surprisingly good news for the Rison 5
2500 you of the 9 graphically intensive
modern triple-a games I looked at
only four games will flat-out unplayable
with a Vega a GPU and on the other hand
games like Star Wars Battlefront 2 and
GTA 5 are surprisingly playable at
decent enough quality settings while
civilization sixes performance makes it
a great option for portable gaming this
is in stark contrast Intel's basic
integrated graphics which was unable to
play any modern game and even crashed in
a couple of titles at least when I
looked at their seventh gen CPUs in mid
2017 and to be honest it's a similar
story with the 8th gen line - as Intel
didn't really upgrade the GPU in any
meaningful way it's quite clear at this
point if it wasn't already the rasma bar
has a massive GPU performance latest
generation of course this video and part
one you can clearly see what this means
for ultra portable laptops games that
weren't previously playable become
playable which is great news for those
that want to play a few rounds in tiles
like fortnight Civilization 6 or Star
Wars Battlefront 2 on the go it should
be an even better story with the Rison
seven 2700 you so once they get my hands
on a laptop with the 2700 you inside
I'll revisit this collection of games to
see if we can increase the quality
levels a little bit but it is tough to
source any laptops with Rison inside as
they're a rare breed right now but the
quality of the apu compared to AMD's
previous offerings will hopefully lead
to more rising laptops in the coming
months if you are interested in buying
one of the few rising laptops on the
market right now we have some Amazon
links to those in the description below
but otherwise that's it for now and I'll
catch you next time
