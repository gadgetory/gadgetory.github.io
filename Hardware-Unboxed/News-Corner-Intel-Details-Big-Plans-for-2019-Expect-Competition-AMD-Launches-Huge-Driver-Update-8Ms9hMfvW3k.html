corner surprisingly big we can use for
December lots of topics to get through
including all the news from Intel's
architecture event new features in AMD
Radeon drivers and lots more so let's
get into it before that this video is
brought to you by deep cool and they're
excellent matrix 55 case we recently
used this case in our budget 1080p built
and we're impressed with the three
included 120 millimeter RGB fans in the
front and an expansive tempered glass
side panel all for an MSRP of just $75
us check it out links in the description
so the big news from this week is all of
the announcements Intel made at their
architecture date 2018 this wasn't an
event where Intel launched any specific
products rather they spent a lot of time
discussing their roadmap for 2019 what's
happening with you know 10 nanometer
CPUs new architectures new designs and
even a little bit on GPUs Anandtech has
a comprehensive article that covers
everything that went down at the event
if you're interested in the more
technical nitty gritty stuff I highly
recommend heading over there and giving
it a read
I'll be skipping over a lot of the more
in-depth architecture discussion button
and tech covers it fully in their
article so first up we have Intel's CPU
core roadmap for the next few years
coming in 2019 are two new architectures
four core processes we have sunny Cove
which is the codename for the CPU core
architecture that will be integrated
into ice lake on 10 nanometers on the
Assam front we also have Tremont or
Tremont then as you can see in the image
there's a lot of other architectures
coming up including willow Cove and
golden Cove for core processors in 2020
and 2021 while Adams CPUs will get an
architecture upgrade every second year
with grace Mont in 2021 and next Mont in
2023 I assume that one's a bit of a
codename for you know something else to
come in the future the slide also lists
some of the improvements Intel set to
make across these architectures so sunny
Cove you can see Intel are targeting
improved single thread performance new
instructions and better scalability this
is in stark contrast to the last few
generations which have simply been
frequency boosts we
we'll bring a cache redesigned a
transistor optimization and security
features then golden curve in 2021
pushes ahead with a whole suite of
improvements to achieve better single
thread performance sunny Cove is
basically a wider CPU design the details
of which are shown here again not going
to go into all the details but there are
a few interesting changes here Intel
aren't talking specifics like core count
frequency or stuff like that just yet
but this architecture is designed for 10
nanometers and that's on track for 2019
also coming with the next line of chips
from Intel is a new generation of
graphics intel's integrated graphics
architecture has been extremely stale
for the last few years again hampered by
Intel struggles with processed
technology but in 2019 we're finally
getting Gen 11 graphics the first major
step since gen 9 was released in 2015
so lots of improvements here the biggest
is a huge jump in execution units for
gt2 graphics so this is intel's most
widely used graphics designed for their
15 watt callyou processes and the most
popular desktop CPUs Gen 11 bumps the EU
count from 24 up to 64 there are lots of
other improvements to the graphics
architecture as well to make those areas
faster and overall Intel says this will
allow gen 11 GPUs to achieve more than
one teraflops per second of compute
performance previously we were in the
400 to 450 gigaflop range so this
improvement would put Intel's integrated
graphics more in line with what AMD is
providing in their rise and mobile AP
use we should also be getting a better
hav see encoder proper HDR tone mapping
support and adaptive sink
intel has been promising to include
adaptive sinking their GPU designs for
years now that's finally happening with
Gen 11 as for discrete desktop graphics
Intel announced these products would
fall under the XE brand that's still
scheduled for 2020 with products ranging
from integrated to mid-range to
enthusiasts to data center exciting
times but I guess nothing more was
shared there the final thing Intel
discussed is fatherís a new technology
for 3d packaging of chips I think it's
called Farva Ross might be pronounced
differently I'm gonna go with for us not
quite sure this is a big step forward
for how Intel is thinking about
designing chips previously a lot of
their products were monolithic dyes but
we're approaching limits of what can be
achieved on that sort of does
intel has also dabbled in a sort of 2.5
D design where they have multiple dyes
connected through an interposer with an
interconnect technology their companies
your cable AG products that used a
member is one such example but with 3d
stacking and for ross the idea is to
improve on that by making the interpose
are active in other words Intel can
offload the PC H or IO from the CPU dies
into the interposer beneath the CPU
cores are then stacked on top the idea
is to remove some of the functions from
the upper chips into the interposes
which then allows Intel to get more
creative with their designs one of the
biggest changes is it should let Intel
to mix and match process technologies
for example the interposer could be made
on 22 nanometers by the cpu cores on 10
enemies Intel also showed off a hybrid
design using fatherís where as I just
mentioned the interposer is 22
nanometers and CPU cores 10 enemies but
the cool thing about this design is it
had a single high performance sunny Cove
CPU core alongside for lower power
awesome costs in the one die so it seems
like Intel is experimenting with the big
little design like arm has been doing
for a while with their mobile chips so
that's a summary of the things Intel
discussed at the event for more again
check out an antic or I find most
interesting about it so I think Intel
has been sliding under the radar of
people a fair bit there's been a lot of
discussion surrounding the companies
lack of progress with process technology
you know issues with ten nanometers and
like especially I think a lot of people
were expecting Intel to stagnate in 2019
while amb reveals all these you know
massive improvements on seven animators
to make their CPUs more competitive with
Intel's architectures and that would
make AMD dominate the market what seems
to have been forgotten is that Intel
also has the capability to continue
innovating and improving their
architectures they've actually had a lot
longer than usual to do this so we could
see some very tasty competition
throughout next year I don't think it
will all be about Zen to the other big
news from this week is Amy's yearly
driver overhaul this time called and get
ready for this AMD Radeon software
adrenalin 2019 Edition version 18 2.2
for the past views ambi has faced a
massive driver update for their gps
around this time which integrates a ton
of cool new features AMD has split up
the feature improvements into three
categories we've got for gamers
and for creators for gamers we have a
set of three advisors the game advisor
which adds to radio an overlay by
providing performance metrics like FPS
and 99% are in real time along with
recommendations for changing game
settings to improve performance settings
advisor scans a system and suggest
optimal display settings while the
upgrade advisor lists are installed
games and suggest upgrades if you're not
meeting the system requirements the more
interesting improvements for you guys
will be things in the enthusiast
category considering those advisors are
more geared towards mainstream gamers
what man now has an auto overclocking
and under vaulting feature though this
is only for Vega GPUs however it seems
this feature is very limited at the
moment it doesn't provide a full voltage
frequency curve for order overclock so
it's not as well suited to Vegas dynamic
GPU clocks as we'd like and in some
cases actually doesn't improve
performance AMD is not using a scan API
here like Nvidia is so the offsets are
very conservative and a static both for
overclocked sand under vaulting so I
think a bit more work can be done with
that feature what men also now supports
changing GPU memory timings which is the
first four GPUs there's also better fan
curve controls and a bunch of other cool
stuff Radeon chill has been improved for
better efficiency in eSports games their
improvements to free sync to hgr tone
mapping and virtual super resolution now
supports 21:9 displays but wait there's
more AMD has overhauled their AMD link
smartphone app with a ton of new
features including voice controls and
what Man for creators relive now
supports in-game replay so you can hit a
button and up to the last 30 seconds of
gameplay are captured there's gift
support a new scene editor and more
gamers can also now stream their games
to their mobile devices or even VR
goggles using the real live game stream
feature you download an app on iOS or
Android and you can stream it up to 4k
60 Hertz with AMD claiming 44 percent
less latency than nvidias competing
solution however it's certainly a lot of
features and I believe the driver is
available to download now if you want to
check out a lot of the stuff that I've
just mentioned ok there's two big topics
covered briefly let's move into some
quicker stuff Animax has announced a new
suite of lick tech 2 all-in-one liquid
coolers for mainstream and desktop CPUs
the basic C is that n MX has adapted
their TR for cooler designs
other desktop CPU light so you still get
the massive cooling capacity of their
tr4 models but a cold plate size and
design that makes it compatible with
small CPUs the company has the lick tech
- in - 40 to 80 and 360 millimeter sizes
offering upwards of 500 watts of heat
dissipation capabilities they are fully
compatible with Intel's and mainstream
and HDD TCP us on the LGA 2066 2011 1366
and 11 5x sockets + Amy's nan a TD TCP
Utes there's a lot of cool features to
these coolers but obviously you're all
interested in the RGB lighting and yes
there's RGB here they will be available
this month but pricing hasn't been
announced gigabyte are preparing to
launch the Zed 390 horas extreme water
force and absolutely insane motherboard
with a light show that would make Las
Vegas jealous the key feature here is a
massive custom water block that covers
the CPU socket VRMs and several other
chips on the motherboard providing the
ultimate cooling for CPUs like the Korra
999 hundred K the board has the same
features as the regular Horus extreme
and is set to cost even more the extreme
is already a $550 ball to this waterfall
model could come in at a really high
price a trademark for AMD Vega 2 has
appeared showing a logo with two stripes
in it this is to indicate the second
generation of Vega products built on
seven nanometers which are destined for
data center applications not the most
riveting discovery but somewhat
interesting nonetheless Corsair has
launched the Vengeance RGB pro light
enhancement kit which are essentially
dummy versions of their vengeance RGB
pro memory that provide cool RGB light
effects the idea here is that you have
say only two of your four dimm slots
populated with RGB memory you can add in
this AB light enhancement kit to fill
out your system and enhance the RGB
nurse of your bills they don't add any
RAM capacity to your system but the
lights are still addressable and the
modules look exactly like vengence RGB
Pro unfortunately the kids are quite
expensive at $40 for a 2-pack
final topic for this week video cards is
a picture of the gigabyte geforce r-tx
2060 which is expected to launch
officially in 2019 let's be honest the
pictures aren't super exciting because
they look like a graphics card from geek
but however there is an 8-pin connector
on there though video cards believe the
actual spec calls for just a 6 pin and
the GPU will be equipped with 30 compute
units or 1920 CUDA cores that's the same
number of CUDA cores as the gtx 1070 or
ver clock speeds at this stage unknown
