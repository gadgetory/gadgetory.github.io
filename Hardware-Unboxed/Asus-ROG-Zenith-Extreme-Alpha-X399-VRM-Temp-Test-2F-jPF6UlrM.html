are breaking out the 32 core thread
Ripper 2990 WX for some vrm torture
testing if you recall late last year I
took 4 flagship X 3 9 and motherboards
and put them to the test and of course
the focus was on vrm thermal performance
so we compared a number of
configurations to see which board kept
its cool the best the most extreme board
of the bunch was MSI's x3 9 iron
creation a 16 phase monster that handled
the 2990 WX with ease it was the only
board to do so without active cool an
impressive feat indeed with the 32 core
processor running and its stock clock
speeds all tested boards passed without
an issue even in our no airflow test but
then as we overclock the 29 9 WX to 4
gigahertz using just one point to 5
volts we had our first victim the asrock
fatality x3 99 pro gaming failed then
for our extreme unrealistic stress test
the gigabyte x3 9 horas extreme failed
leaving just the MSI x3 nine creation
and a soos rog zenith extreme standing
the assist board provided the best
thermals but it was also quite loud with
that 40 millimeter fans screaming to
keep the temperatures under control in a
somewhat makeshift effort a soos did
develop an upgrade kit for the zenith
extreme that added a 40 millimeter fan
directly to the vehicle VM heatsink we
never tested this but was more loud 40
millimeter fans this isn't exactly an
ideal solution so a soos has recreated
the zenith Extreme as the zenith Xtreme
alpha yeah they really need to work
they're naming out so basically what
this means as we now have the asou ROG
zenith Xtreme alpha and boy oh boy does
that abuse the hell out of my two words
per product name rule anyway the zenith
extreme is a completely new beast
actually it's a really heavy beast I'll
sit this down here as I talk about it so
a soos has been forced to push the eight
DIMM slots down to make way for 16 power
stages and this is the same thing MSI
had to do with their creation however
whereas the creation has a 16 phase VR
this board has 16 power stages but
despite that it doesn't have a 16 phase
VRM a soos maintains that opting to
neglect phase doublers is the way to go
they say double has introduced a
processing delay of 20 nanoseconds and
increase operating temperatures they do
provide us with some information as well
as some thermal imaging for the zenith
extreme alpha apparently with and
without phase doubles and the images
they showed us with phase double as the
board was running about 4 degrees hotter
of course without the two different
versions to test for ourselves we'll
just have to take them at their word
none of this really matters what matters
is how well there's anything stream
alpha stacks up to MSI's X through 9
creation and we'll get to that in a
moment the Alpha still isn't a
completely passive board though it is
much closer than the original there's
still two tiny verum fans integrated
into the main heatsink but by default
these little guys only spin up when the
verum temperature exceeds 60 degrees
Celsius that said you can completely
customize how they work in the bath by
using the manual fan profile setting now
this isn't a motherboard review per se
rather it's just a look at how the
board's vrm performs thermally under
heavy load since I did do that X 399
verum thermal testing roundup late last
year I felt it made sense to update that
content with the new zenith extreme
alpha that said before we get into the
thermal results I would like to just
quickly touch on a few features of the
board and highlight what's new for
starters the soos has integrated the 10
gigabit networking into the board the
original version included a PCI
expansion card to support this feature
the 8 plus 4 pin CPU power input has
been upgraded to an eight plus eight pin
configuration and while we've already
gone over the vehicle portion of the
verum the vdd SOC has also been upgraded
from to power stages without cooling 2/3
power stages with a heatsink the Wi-Fi
has also been upgraded whereas the
original version supporter transfer
speeds of up to 866 megabits per second
the Alpha is good for 1.73 gigabits per
second bluetooth support has also been
upgraded from version 4.1 to 5.0 the
unit 2 ports been dropped in favor of
two SATA ports which I'm happy to see
this takes the SATA port count from 6 to
8 there's also two extra USB 3.1 gen2
ports
there's also a few other asou speeches
that have either been added or upgraded
such as ROG Ram cache 3 ROG knowed the
fan connect to module and bars flashback
for example but I think that's enough
about the board let's get into the vrm
testing to apply load to the system I'm
not using a power bug type program like
prime95 nothing against using that kind
of software certainly has its place but
for this kind of test I really want to
use a real-world application so
therefore I went with a blender workload
and the workload that we use takes the
2990 WX a little over 20 minutes to
complete so for the hour-long stress
test we are running three back-to-back
runs the load results are reported after
the hour-long stress test and we're
reporting the peak temperature and then
the idle is taken after a 10-minute
cooldown period there's three main tests
in total first we're looking at the
stock results so that is the stock out
of the box 2990 WX performance then we
have a fog you go hurt overclock using
just one point to five volts so somewhat
of a realistic overclock there but then
we have a unrealistic ridiculous stress
test at 4 gigahertz using one point 4
volts just to see what these boards are
made of all three tests are conducted
twice once on an open air test bed there
was no direct airflow over the vrm
though take note that the asou sang
gigabyte boards do have small fans so
they aren't truly passive and therefore
they do kind of cheat on that test then
we have a second test configuration
inside the corsair 500 d with three 120
millimeter intake fans in the front two
120 millimeter intake fans in the top
and then a single 120 millimeter exhaust
fan in the rear so the top mounted fans
are pushing air flow directly over the
board's vrm heat sinks then cooling the
CPU was the nm acts liquor tech 280
which was mounted in the front of the
case for recording temperatures I'm
using a digital thermometer with k-type
thermocouple x' I've placed multiple
sensors on the surface of multiple power
stages to measure the temperature across
the verum and I'll be reporting the
highest value so this means I'm
measuring the temperature directly on
top of the component between it and the
thermal pad and not an internal
temperature which is bound to be a
little bit higher still with all boards
tested under the exact same conditions
it will give us a clearer idea of how
they compare
starting with the open testbed results
which sees no direct airflow over the
vrm heat sinks we have the stop 2990 WX
temperatures again remember the gigabyte
board packs to 35 millimeter fans and
the original Isuzu Zenith Xtreme a
single 40 millimeter fan while the MSI
and asrock boards are completely passive
then we have the new Zenith Xtreme alpha
which has two small fans though by
default they only spin when the vrm
exceeds 60 degrees which in this test it
didn't here we see the Alpha hitting
just 59 degrees and this did cause the
fans to twitch every now and then but
they never really fully fired up this is
a two to three degree improvement over
the MSI x3 and creation and the original
Zenith Xtreme so a solid result but
without an overclock we're not really
taking advantage of these high and
motherboards okay so time to overclock
and at 4 gigahertz using 1.25 volts the
Alpha was a degree cooler than the
original zenith extreme and that would
certainly be within our margin of error
the completely passive MSI X 399
creation also does very well in this
test given its the only board not aided
by an active fan then finally the
extreme stress test using 1.5 volts and
it's here that the zenith extreme alpha
really starts to shine the small fans
were spinning but honestly they weren't
very loud certainly much quieter than
the fan featured on the gigabyte X 399
or s extreme and the original Zenith
extreme the Alpha is almost 18 degrees
cooler than the x3 nine uncreation
though I feel this is a bit unfair as a
small fan would certainly help bring
down the temperatures for the msi board
in this zero airflow stress test
now with the boards installed inside the
corsair 500 d we have direct airflow
over the verum heatsink so this will no
doubt help reduce load temperatures in
fact we see just 5 degrees separating
the msi a sous and gigabyte boards the
x3 99 creation does very well in the
stock test while the Alpha was a few
degrees cooler than the original zenith
extreme moving on to some overclocking
with airflow we see that the MSI x3
night uncreation
does much better this time we're
basically seeing the same performance
out of the Croatian
Zenith extreme and Zenith
Stream alpha finally we have the most
extreme stress test which sees the 2990
WX running at four gigahertz using one
point 4 volts here we're yet again seen
basically the same performance from the
zenith extreme Zenith extreme alpha
along with the creation the zenith
extreme alpha is a quieter board under
these extreme test conditions but as you
can see the actual temperatures aren't
really any different
ok so last time I did a VR M thermal
testing I concluded that the Asuza
rog zenith extreme rivaled the bigger
beefier msi board i went on to say
though that for extreme overclocking the
msi board will ultimately win out but
for a more typical overclock 1.25 to 1.3
volts there appears to be little
difference between the Asuza and msi
boards both around it just over 70
degrees when installed in our corsair
500 d test system now with the zenith
extreme alpha added to the mix a sous
does have a high-end X 399 motherboard
that can rival the creation for extreme
overclocks
having said that I suspect that this
won't mean a whole lot for most of you
running the 2990 WX @ 4 gigahertz maybe
up to 4.2 gigahertz with 1.25 to 1.3
volts can easily be achieved on either
of their sous boards whether that be the
zenith extreme or the new
zenith extreme alpha but it is nice to
know that the Alpha is built to do it
more comfortably the Alpha is a more
refined offering with some nice features
having said that I nearly spat my coffee
all over my screen when I saw the price
meant 650 dollars u.s. at middlee for an
extreme high and X 399 motherboard
that's not absurd the MSI x3 9 crashing
for example that was selling for around
$600 not that long ago but the original
Zenith extreme did only sell for five
hundred and twenty dollars and today
MSI's croatians also selling for just
five hundred and twenty dollars us this
is a small issue because if I were
buying a thread ripper 2950 X or better
I'd consider my motherboard options to
be the MSI X 3 9 and creation or a soos
ROG zenith extreme alpha of the two
boards the Alpha is probably the better
offering as a workstation grade practice
we appreciate the inclusion of 10
gigabit networking but I'm not convinced
that the fad eight phase-- BRM is any
better than MSI's doubled 16 phase but I
suppose it doesn't really matter
they both handled the overclocked 32
core processor with ease in the end if
you require 10 gigabit networking then I
think you'll agree the zenith extreme
alpha is the obvious choice it also
helps that the board looks great to load
it with tons of really good features and
it has that glorious of SUSE UEFI BIOS
with the exception of the price is
really nothing negative or no drawbacks
that I've come across with this board in
my testing it's a really solid product
from top to bottom and certainly one of
the best if not the best x 399
motherboard on the market again this was
mostly meant to just be a vrm test but I
did spend quite a few days playing
around to the zenith extreme alpha and I
really do like it and that is going to
do it for this one if you enjoy the
