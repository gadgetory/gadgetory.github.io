taipei for Computex 2019 and although
the trade show doesn't kick off till
tomorrow we've still got some pretty
exciting news for you guys today as aim
D held their keynote ahead of the show
that's actually a first for AMD and
videos got their keynote later today and
we'll find out what that super teaser is
all about in fact you might actually
know by the time this video goes live
depending on how long editing processing
all that sort of stuff takes anyway
AMD's keynote was live streamed on their
channel so anybody could watch it but if
you missed it or you didn't want to
watch an hour-long keynote then
hopefully we can summarize the good bits
for you and share some of our thoughts
before that though a quick word about
our sponsors firstly a big THANK YOU to
MSA for making it possible for Tim and
myself to attend Computex 2019 please
check out their latest AMD x5 70
motherboards made for gamers and
creators by the link in the video
description also thank you to Corsair
for their support please check all their
exciting products out via the link in
the video description so getting right
into it the stuff we care about and
hopefully you guys do as well AMD
announced the new Radeon rx 5000 series
and it's based on the new array D on DNA
architectural our DNA for short this is
very much like what they did with these
n based CPUs which were designed from
scratch so aim DS doing the same thing
with our DNA for GPUs this is a new
architecture it's designed exclusively
for gaming so GC and will still remain
for compute workloads but our DNA will
lead the charge for AMD when it comes to
gaming products Lissa claims an
incredible 1.25 performance per clock
increase and a one and a half times
performance per watt improvement over
the GC and 5th gen architecture so this
is really going to help AMD
significantly in their battle with
NVIDIA they also demoed the rx 5700
head-to-head with the RT X 2070 in
strange Brigade and claimed a 10%
performance increase though we know this
is an AMD sponsored title so overall
we're expecting our TX 2070 live
performance the good news is we'll know
exactly what the rx 5700 is all about
as na'vi GPUs will become available in
July and we can expect much more info
shortly On June 10th at e3 including
pricing aim D then moved on to talk
about desktop CPUs Lisa opened up saying
AMD wasn't satisfied with their 1st and
2nd generation processors she went on to
say that they were hoping for a 7 to 8%
IPC improvement with his n 2 but was
amazed when the engineers pulled out a
15% IPC improvement over the first
iteration of Zen that's an insane IPC
increase and all absolutely puts into on
par or ahead every Intel's latest
generation CPUs so the first CPU they
involved was the AMD Rison 730 700 X an
8 core 16 thread CPU clocked at three
point six cubits for the base and 4.4
gigahertz for the boost so those are
very similar clock speeds to the 2700 X
but there are a few crucial improvements
the cache has been upgraded massively
here we see a doubling from Zen 16
megabyte level 3 cache to a whopping 30
2 megabyte cache for Zen 2 then we see
the TDP drop down from 105 watts to just
65 watts these improvements made for a
15% increase in Cinebench are 20 score
over the 2,700 X aimday also showed the
3700 X beating the core i7 9700 K by
almost 30% in Cinebench r20 and that's
an important comparison given the 3,600
X is set to cost just 330 dollars u.s.
so for the same launch prices the 2700 X
you're getting a 40 percent lower TDP
part with around a 15 percent
improvement in performance then of
course it's also much cheaper than the
core i7 97 or okay which has a 374
dollar US MSRP and generally retails for
a little over $400 u.s. then moving on
amy announced a slightly higher end 8
core part the AMD rise in 7 3800 x and
this one comes in at $400 u.s. the clock
speeds see a small increase to 3.9 g
codes for the base and 4.5 gigahertz for
the boost not quite the 5 gigahertz
clock speeds everyone was hyped for but
given what we've seen so far I doubt to
many of you will be disappointed the
3900 X is positioned as an upgrade
option for 2700 X owners and while it
doesn't seem like a
particularly impressive product next to
the much cheaper 3700 X we don't yet
know what the extra TDP Headroom does
for technologies such as
xfr we're still yet to learn anything
about XFR or precision boost for these
parts so you might have to wait for
reviews to get answers there then to cap
all those n2 news off aimday announced
their first mainstream 12 core 24 thread
part the risin nine 3900 X this CPU
operates at a base frequency of 3.8
gigahertz with a boost frequency of 4.6
gigahertz and it packs a grand total of
70 megabytes of cash this is still a 105
watt TDP part and the price has been set
at $500 u.s. there will obviously be a
16 core 32 am 4 processor don't think
anyone actually doubted that but we
weren't expecting it to come at the
initial launch and that certainly seems
to be the case here perhaps AMD will
drop that one on us next year but yeah
we're just guessing at this point but
there's certainly the possibility for a
16 core part this means at least for now
the horizon 939 Rx is the flagship am 4
part and it will use 2 chip --let's in a
6 plus 6 configuration but because it is
an AM 4 process that there are just 24
PCIe lanes in total though they are now
PCI Express 4.0 lanes AMD did run a demo
comparing the 3900 X to the core I $9.99
20 X so Intel's $1,200 high-end desktop
processor versus aim DS upcoming $500
mainstream is in two part aim d1 that
comparison in Cinebench are twenty by a
six percent margin so that was an
impressive demonstration I should also
note that they're comparing a 165 watt
Intel CPU to a 105 what AMD CPU after
the keynote aimday also discussed some
risin 5 models the 3600 x and the 3600
both a 6 chord 12 threaded CPUs the 3600
features a 95 watt TDP and operates at a
base frequency of 3.8 gigahertz with a
boost of 4.4 gigahertz while the 3700
has a 65 watt TDP and runs at a base of
3 point 6 gigahertz with a boost of 4.2
gigahertz both feature a 32 megabyte l3
cache the 3700 X costs 250 dollars and
the 3600 just $200
there's gonna be pretty amazing value
parts and they'll no doubt be the most
popular options for desktop users the
risin 7 and rising 9 parts that were
officially announced on the livestream
they'll be hitting shelves on July 7th
so roughly 6 weeks from now you will be
able to buy one of these news into
processors and perhaps more crucially
check out independent reviews wrapping
this up there's still a lot of
information that we haven't touched on
yet either because we haven't well we
haven't got concrete information on that
sort of stuff yet or we're under NDA we
have signed a few ndas for certain
things one thing that I haven't
discussed yet that we don't have any
seriously concrete information on but it
seems like that's a thing based on the
information we've got from certain
motherboard vendors but it seems like
ddr4 32-hundred will be the new official
memory support for Xen 2 processors so
not a huge improvement over Xen plusses
2933 support but it should mean that
getting memory to work at faster speeds
and what we're currently able to analyze
and processes and will be possible so
that's obviously a good thing presumably
AMD demoed their Zen to protesters with
ddr4 3200 based on what we're hearing so
it'll be exciting to see what they can
do with even faster memory anyway I'm
personally just really pleased with what
we've been showing here I was a little
concerned but yeah really excited really
pleased with what we were shown the
narvi demonstration looked really
promising and I like the direction that
AMD is taking here with the new Radeon
rx 5000 series of course there's n2
stuff that was amazing
we were always pretty sure that was
gonna be amazing it was more of a
concern of what we'd actually be shown
it sounded like for a bit there that it
might be a bit of a chipset launch with
just more teasers of Zen - but no we got
specs we've got prices of the higher-end
parts and then we heard about the risin
5 parts behind the scene so that's
awesome stuff and I'm really excited now
to hit the showroom floor tomorrow and
check out those X 570 motherboards and
see what else we can learn about these
n2 processors
anyway that is going to do it for this
one I hope you enjoyed our summary of
the AMD livestream the keynote and
please stay tuned for more product
announcements throughout the week
because Tim and myself will be covering
those anyway thank you for watching I'm
your host Steve I'll see you
next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
