monthly QA and yeah things don't seem
quite right because my trusty sidekick
tim is not here this was meant to be the
first QA we did in my studio for the
first time in a long time but
unfortunately tim has got sick so yeah
that sucks he's been sick a bit lately
so poor little guy okay hopefully he
gets better soon I didn't want to risk
catching up with him this week even if
he did start to feel better and he was
possibly feeling good enough to do the
Q&amp;amp;A because well we've got a lot of
really important content coming up on
the channel over the next week or so and
I can't afford to be sick at all so yeah
we're gonna give Tim the flick this week
I'm gonna handle all your questions by
myself so yeah a bit of a lonely Q&amp;amp;A
this month but anyway hopefully to move
you back next month and we can do our
usual Q&amp;amp;A where we tackle all the
questions together anyway I'm gonna jump
into the first question here and this
one was the most heavily upvoted
question on the YouTube page the YouTube
community tab besides and actually I'm
gonna sometimes put my phone this way
because I've taken screenshots of the
questions and they're absolutely tiny on
Google Docs and have my phone around
this way so yeah that that's why I do
that for some people get confused while
I'm holding my phone or reading
questions when it's oriented this way if
I have to explain that anyway beast
besides the tech stuff what other
hobbies do you guys have okay good
question
not sure we've addressed this one before
Tim basically well Tim's Tim's a pretty
simple guy he's 11 years younger than me
that's not what makes him simple he just
he likes to stick to his Legos you guys
have probably noticed for me he's back
drop in his studio so he's a big lego
fan he likes what else does Tim like he
likes Lego he likes playing with tech
stuff or making YouTube videos he likes
watching TV's and movies
Nealon TV he's a big fan of that so and
of course he's a he's a big PC gamer he
also is a pretty big console gamer as
well so I think Tim's just a a video
gamer in general so that's Tim and then
me what am i well when I'm not slaving
away on the YouTube channel producing
videos every minute I really enjoy going
fishing so I'm a big fan of kayak
fishing so I'd do that as much as I can
pretty much a thing for the warmer
months of the year but yeah I really
enjoy doing that and I try to take at
least one big sort of fishing trip per
year so we did that earlier this year
where North spent a week fishing on the
kayaks that was a whole lot of fun and I
also really enjoy I suppose you call it
handyman type things building working
out how to use different tools and
things to create so I spend quite a bit
of time outdoors doing that when I do
get some free time and the weather's
half decent so yeah I mean I enjoy doing
a whole heap of different things but
yeah mainly fishing and building stuff
so I do quite a bit of that and I'd make
some behind-the-scenes videos that I
share with the patrons to sort of give a
bit of an insight to what I do in any
spare time that I have all right next
one is from Jeremiah throws me a bit of
a curveball with this one but a lot of
you did upload it so we'll address it do
you think AMD and NVIDIA a price fixing
the GPU market quite an interesting one
that honest well we were sort of talking
about this I had a good chat with Chris
from the good old gamer if you don't
know who the good old gamer is have a
search in the youtube search and yeah
subscribe to his channel he puts out a
lot of really interesting
thought-provoking content he talks about
this kind of stuff on his channel a lot
we mostly agreed with what's going on
Chris was a bit more critical he was a
bit more insistent that I suppose price
gouging was taking place and again yeah
I didn't really disagree with that but I
wanted more information I'm not
convinced that things like manufacturing
costs haven't also increased quite
significantly as well over the years and
it makes producing these big complex
GPUs quite quite costly
so yeah I mean you can take a
Vega for example I mean there was the
whole HBO memory thing there but AMD
didn't really make a profit as far as
I'm aware with Vega if they did make a
profit it was extremely small and there
wasn't much in it for their board
partners which is why you didn't see
custom Vega cards if you don't see
custom cards
there's obviously well there's no
margins there to make them so I'm
buddy's trying to turn a profit with the
rDNA stuff I think they're going to
successfully do that and to do that they
sort of have to price-match in video
where they're at I think once AMD
becomes a bit more competitive they've
got a few more SKUs covering a broad a
range of price and performance then they
will will see the GPU was fire up again
I hope I think that'll happen but yeah
I'd like to know more about things like
manufacturing costs we know they're
spending a lot on research and
development these days to try and get
those gains it's a lot harder to get
those big gains that we used to see
these days and we're sort of seeing that
everywhere in tech so yeah it's not the
Moore's law is somewhat dead I think in
2019 but anyway to answer this question
really quickly no I don't think AMD and
NVIDIA teaming up to do any kind of
price fixing ok bit of an easy one fee
from Stanislaw I think it is will I get
better gaming performance from changing
my r5 1600 x2 upcoming r5 3600 X or from
changing rx 588 gigabyte to Vega 56
prices of both upgrades should it be
similar another heavily outvoted comment
sure to turn my phone sideways for that
yeah ok that's that is a pretty easy one
to answer I would say you'd be much
better off with value 56 though I'd
strongly advise you wait at this point
to see what the Radeon rx 5700 series
has to offer and then reevaluate your
options then that'll make the most sense
we also have some new NVIDIA GPUs coming
up not sure what that's going to do to
sort of that what is well what I don't
even know Vega 56 is at you said that's
the same as the CPU upgrade in your
region it's around
what are they 350 to 400 US dollars have
looked recently but yeah we'll have some
new GPUs filling in that price point
soon okay one here from Daniel do you
guys remember AMD said a m4 would be
officially supported until 2020 when
they announced it back in 2017 what do
you think will be the future of the
platform going forward well yeah I do
remember AMD saying that and as far as
I'm aware that's true to this day with
well I suppose the exception of the a
300 and a 320 motherboards which are
said to not support as n2 for various
reasons but as far as I know speaking
with companies at Computex again I'm yet
to test this and verify it but the
companies I spoke with said that all of
their be 350 and X 370 motherboards will
support these and processes or the Zen
to processors if I had to guess which I
hate doing but I'll do it anyway so this
is just me guesswork speculating I would
say that these n3 processors so that's
the seven nanometer plus rice and CPUs
probably going to be called the rise in
4000 series probably not a huge leap
that one
I'd say they'll work on existing a.m.
for motherboards as well at least in
some capacity but again just guessing on
that one
so yeah AMD have said that they will
support the a m4 platform to at least
2020 beyond that though yeah again I'd
have to guess I'd say probably not at
that point we'll probably see some sort
of socket change that may be
incompatible with a m4 again I'm just
speculating on that one so ok next
question here I won't butcher your name
so I'll spare you that will aim DB
releasing Navi GPUs at 200 to $300 range
to compete with the 1662 I slash 1,600
or they leave it at rx 590 by the way
did you know 570 XT limited edition was
going to be called rx 690 you can check
the slides aimed as shown at e3 if you
zoom in on the fan it says rx 690 loved
from India well thank you okay so the
first part that question I would expect
at some point
we will see more affordable rDNA parts
but another one of those speculations
guesses I have absolutely no idea when
that will be
so with AMD it could be it could be at
any point in time so yeah I'd hate to
guess on that one but I think it makes
sense that they will make the rDNA
architecture more affordable and more
accessible at some point in time and
then as for the 570 series or the 570 XT
being the RX six and 90 yeah I would
have guessed rx 680 or 690 personally
probably pretty safe place holder there
and then they've decided to change it to
something that sounds a bit more fancy
to go with the new RDA architecture okay
an interesting question here from deep
are you gonna keep using the FPS charts
as benchmarks forever recently Steve GN
has introduced frame time chart method
what is your opinion about it are you
expecting to bring similar methodology
to your benchmark marathon and quite a
few up votes on that one as well yeah we
might I haven't ruled it out I doesn't
work particularly well when comparing a
lot of CPUs and GPUs which we tend to do
I know gamers Nexus do as well I suppose
you can select just a few to do head to
heads with so yeah if a head head stuff
it is possible
generally it's been my experience at the
frame time or any frame time issues that
you see are reflected in the 1% low data
which are which is a frame time metric
then converted over to fps so it's a bit
easier to digest basically I try to make
data or our graphs as clear and easy to
understand as possible a lot of you guys
seem to appreciate that and really like
reviews and content because we do that
occasionally I'll remove some
unnecessary things like for example from
the Zen to content I'll be removing the
eighth most of the 8th gen core
processes because well the IE 600 K has
just been replaced by the 9600 KS but
it's a hundred megahertz refresh so
there's no point including both of those
that clutters up the graphs and I'll
just say to you guys in that content if
you've got an 80 to 200 K or you'll want
to know how that performs it within a
percent or two
of the 9600 K I'll have the ID 700 K
because that's obviously a non refreshed
part but yeah my point is I try to make
the the graphs and the data as as well
as clean as possible I try to remove any
unnecessary clutter and I know the line
graphs tend to be a bit hard to follow
if I have to illustrate that yeah there
is a frame time issue there's some
spikes here and there then yeah we'll
use them I know Tim's done that in the
past so yeah we certainly haven't ruled
out using them but yeah at the moment
we're not going to use them regularly
next one here is from Rick what's your
plan for Zen to coverage and how many
sleepless nights are you expecting to
get from those rapid-fire benchmarks
thanks for the benchmarks it really
helps a lot well thank you for enjoying
all the benchmarks yeah well firstly
I've already started testing all the
necessary processes for comparison so I
usually try to do that at least a week
ahead of time so I've been spending
about a week at this point testing the
necessary 8th gen processes like I just
spoke of the 87 or okay then the 9th gen
stuff like the 9600 K the 97 or okay the
99 or okay and then some first and
second gen rising processors then I'll
probably look at some scale like X and
thread ripper parts so already I've had
quite a lot of really late nights
updating that data of course I'm also
updating my GPU data as well and about a
dozen games for comparing with new
Nvidia and AMD GPUs so that's a lot
happening at the moment and I'd be lying
if I said I wasn't a little bit
terrified of what's gonna happen over
the next week because yeah I'm a little
scared about how AMD is going to execute
this release and yeah I think in video
might be throwing some stuff in the
works there as well so yeah I love my
benchmarking but I think it's going to
get a bit beyond a bit out of control
over the next few weeks but we'll see
what happens the 3700 X have more
overclocking Headroom compared to 3800 X
okay well right away obviously I have to
guess because I don't know at this point
in time and if I did know that I
couldn't really tell you so still don't
have any CPUs to test at this point in
time so
pure guesswork and yet as I just said so
well I suppose we can kind of work it
out based on what we've seen
historically the 2700 X that generally
overclocked better than the 2700 if you
look at sites like a hardware but I
think on average of the 2,700 X hits
around I think it was about four
thousand one hundred fifty megahertz I
might put some links or some stuff on
the screen so you can get the exact
stats and that was from about 3000 users
than the 2700 that hit about three point
nine five about there so it's about 100
megahertz lower and that was from about
560 users again I'm not really sure how
reliable that data is it's based on
there's a lot of variables such as
motherboard quality people with 27
hundreds may not have bought ah as
high-end motherboard as those with 2,700
X's then it's based on user skill and
all that kind of stuff and the cooling
and whatnot so it's really hard to say
my 2700 matches my 2700 X but it's not
quite as good at memory overclocking so
that would suggest that 2700 X's are
Bend as they they claim to be that's a
65 watt and 105 wat comparison so better
one might be the 1700 X and the 1800 X
and as far as I know they're basically
identical on hardware but the non X 1700
is about a hundred megahertz lower so
again those 65 watt parts don't
overclock quite as well which is
probably why they've been as 65 watt
parts top vines asks are you going to
test cheaper X 570 motherboards as well
and ITX boards yeah well I'm going to
try and get my hands on all of the X 570
motherboards probably bit ambitious as
many as I possibly can as quickly as I
can but yeah if that means taking some
of our patreon money and buying the
cheapest boards from asrock MSI gigabyte
a Seuss for example then yeah I'll do
exactly that because I'd like to know
yeah how the VRMs on those boards
perform what sort of temperatures they
run out what features you get and just
overall who offers the best budget x5 70
board so it's definitely something I'll
do the ITX ball
I'd like to look at as well they're
probably lower on my priority list but
yeah I'll get to those that also have
liked have a look at the asrock MHz
export as well so hopefully I'll be able
to do that before too long but they'll
definitely be some ITX Rison
3000 series builds on the channel and
they're not reduced in future I reckon
Tim's gonna be pretty keen to get into
those so yeah we'll make them happen
our next question here is from awesome
tech Chan my phone the right way do you
think 2nd gen prices will go down
further with 3rd gen being in market or
in the market again another one of these
tough questions that my crystal ball
isn't functioning right now but second
gen Verizon's already pretty cheap
they've gone on sale a few times at
ridiculously low prices they'll probably
drop a little bit though I don't know if
it'll be straight away
like I said they they're already quite
cheap at the moment they're definitely
gonna head south at some point yeah
whether it's six months after there's
end to launch I have no idea but I I
probably wouldn't be holding out for any
massive discounts straight away but like
I said who knows I'm just guessing time
will tell we're not a few weeks I don't
know if this is one sorry again if I've
completely messed up the your name what
is the minimum power supply for gaming
PC for gaming PC should you get a bigger
one and how much is too big yeah okay
I'd say for a mid-range PC probably
around the 600 to 650 watt range is
probably pretty optimal assuming it's
like a sort of at least a bronze rated
power supply yeah that that'd be fine
really I mean a mid-range system doesn't
draw that much power so 600 watts is
plenty of headroom and does allow for a
few upgrades and really too big I'd say
for most people once you sort of start
getting up for over 800 watts 800 850
beyond that it's getting a bit extreme
and unnecessary but it's not necessarily
a bad thing either I mean you do lose a
bit of efficiency when you go stupidly
too high
so and you're just wasting a ton of
money
because you don't need a power supply
that big so anyway I think it's best
just to look at your hardware
configuration and what you think you may
be expanding to upgrading with power
supply ones always a tough question but
in my experience pretty much all the
builds we do work perfectly fine with
like a 600 watt power supply if you can
get a gold rated 600 watt power supply
you should be pretty golden no pun
intended okay the next question here is
from my man Zak how long do you guys
spend editing an average video the
content is always top notch thank you
very much and with only the two of you
it must be a decent timespan yeah well
as we've said a few times in the past
Tim and I were completely independent of
one another so I don't help with editing
Tim's videos and whatnot because we live
about two to three hours apart depending
on traffic and uploading the content to
share to add and stuff so it's not
really an option on Australian internet
so yeah all my videos to Matt it's all
his and to answer the question it could
be anywhere from a couple of hours to a
day or more it really depends on the
content so for example this video this
would probably be one of the quickest
videos we have to edit I'd do this in
like an hour or so and it probably takes
just as long to encode it and then
upload it so this is a pretty quick and
easy bit to do which is well we enjoy
doing them each month partly because of
that but also because you guys like
having some of your questions answered
but big benchmark videos yeah they're at
least a day because that's just putting
all the graphs in getting all that
sorted footage and yeah there's a whole
heap of stuff involved there Tim's news
corner that's another pretty easy one he
says he bangs that together pretty
quickly so you can probably tell which
ones take a lot of editing work and
which ones don't and generally the ones
with a lot of editing work have a lot of
other work associated with them so
filming b-roll that's always massively
time-consuming and then maybe creating
graphs exporting excel graphs making
sure sure they're all the right
dimensions and things haven't moved all
over the place that's always very time
consuming tedious and annoying anyway
depends on the video tick GT says hello
welcome how do you benchmark so many
games do you
an HDD slash SSD that games are on and
then you swap the hard drive or SSD
between different computers no we don't
do that because that method would work
quite well for Steam games as you can
just sit your Steam library and then
there's just like an initial install
each time it takes only a matter of
seconds and you're away but games like
the epic game store it's a real pain in
the backside the Windows Store is an
absolute utter nightmare so we try to
avoid that at all costs origin and you
play aren't too bad origin just sucks
because the hardware limit but yeah you
play in that you just copy the games
into the right folder and then you're
away but you'd still have to copy them
to the folder from the secondary drive
so it's not really a great solution
generally what we do is we have multiple
two terabyte SSDs Tim's got a couple
I've got a lot so we've spent a hell of
a lot of money on SSDs but it's a really
good solution because I have one two
terabyte SSD that has all the games on
it so I can then copy them to the
appropriate folders when we do a fresh
install and that's quite quick because
you can do it like three four hundred
make per second and then I have another
you know two terabyte SSD couple of them
for AMD installs a couple for Intel
installs because we're always updating
and doing fresh installs and all that
sort of stuff so yeah two terabyte SSD
is really are the key and be nice to
upgrade to some 4 terabyte SSDs but yeah
not quite in the budget just yet ok next
question here is from Tomo the x5 70
will be really expensive according to
some leaks or leaked sources plus Intel
will decrease their price so my question
is will AMD build stay value for money
for high end processes depends on I
suppose what you mean by value for money
so you know you can argue that the
thread were for 2099 and WX isn't good
value because it's an expensive
processor but then you get 32 cores for
the same price that Intel's giving you
18 there's some cons and pros back and
forth there but it's still a very
expensive CPU they're not giving you 32
cores for $500 so yeah I mean they're
charging I think it was $700 for the 16
core part $500 for the 12 core part and
that's pretty pricey but I'm and I think
it's outrageous and I think it's still
better than what Intel's offering of
course we've still got a bench market
and see where the performance really
lies but I think based on what we're
expecting some IPC gains the clock speed
gains some better memory performance
yeah I think I think it's they're still
gonna represent really strong value for
the performance that you're getting so I
don't think too much is going to change
there people are getting a bit yeah
caught up with the x5 70 motherboards
being very pricey but AMD's already said
you don't have to get an x5 70
motherboard performance is exactly the
same with ABI 450 or x4 70 motherboard
so Amy's claim to that again we'll test
it but it'd be weird for them to say
that and then it'd be different so it
seems like you can get something like a
really there's there's a couple of
really high quality B 450 motherboards
that aren't terribly expensive or just
over $100 u.s. so you can grab one of
those and then you can stick an eight
core processor on it for not much and
you should have a really really high-end
system capable of some good productivity
stuff gaming whatever so I think it's
yeah I think it's still gonna be pretty
good people are getting a bit a bit
caught up with the the these are rumors
or confirmed pricing for expensive x5 70
motherboards aren't necessarily
necessary ok I think we have a monitor
question here but we haven't got Tim so
I'll do my best
can a 4k 60 Hertz monitor do 120 Hertz
in 1440p or Eternity pay that seems like
a few of you were interested by this
question a short answer is no so if that
was the case say it was 144 hurts cuz we
have a couple of 4k 144 Hertz panels
that I'm aware of if it could do that at
1440p and 1080p but not 4k it would just
it would still be a 4k 144 it's panel
but for some reason it would be disabled
at 4k which we've never seen and
wouldn't happen so yeah the refresh rate
user doesn't really work that way or
generally doesn't anyway so anyway the
answer's no if Tim was here you probably
would've got a technical and better
answer to that question but he's not
he's sick so you know that's on Tim
Jacob says what is your most hated QA
question that people
constantly ask you how tall are you
I get that a lot I don't know why people
have this obsession over how tall I am
or how tall Tim is don't really care
don't hate that question at all it's
just funny that so many people are
curious about that I suppose because we
sit and you don't see the lower half of
our body most of the time so I don't
know anyway yeah there's nothing I
really hate I really like all the
questions you guys asked it's always
interesting to us sometimes it helps
with content we we create because it's
based on things you guys are interested
in and it's just always really awesome
to hear from the audience so there's
nothing I hate probably the difficult
ones to answer are the ones that we
can't really answer the ones that I've
sort of tackle t where I've had to
speculate or guess I suppose maybe you
guys are interested in hearing our
guesses again we don't put a huge amount
of thought and effort into the guesses
so it's not really doing your questions
justice but at the end of the day I'm
going to have a much research we do it's
a bit more of an educated guess but it's
still a guess all the same so we rather
just wait and give you guys the actual
information then risk
misleading you so that's that really now
I'll move on to the next one from Brian
let's see where are you Brian here we go
how much difference would the IP see
improvement of Zen - compared to zonal
Zen plus make on GPUs like Vega 56 / 64
GTX 10:17 1070 TI 1080 our checks 20 60
and 20 70 some pretty much all mid-range
GPUs would it also give a noticeable
boost in FPS or will only have an impact
on high-end GPUs such as the RT X 20 IDT
I I suppose the best answer for that
question would really be what I often
say it depends on the game so for the
most part you would be with those GPUs
you'd be GPU limited even with sort of a
more affordable CPU so when you're
playing at 1440p with high to ultra
quality settings you're very much GPU
limited so for games such as World War Z
rage -
maybe yes probably farcry and a list
this long of other mostly GPU bound
games that won't make a difference
that's not to say it won't make a
difference everywhere so games that are
very single threaded single core maybe
Starcraft maybe I don't know any any
games like that you're so I think all
those roller coaster sort of games the
city building games they'll see a
noticeable uptick in performance thanks
to increased IPC also clock speed memory
performance all that sort of stuff but
yet it's really game dependent more than
the GPU obviously within our TX 2080 TI
@ 1080p you'll see a performance
increase everywhere
less so at 1440p and then maybe almost
not at all at 4k because you're
extremely GPU limited there so anyway
we're I'm interested to do the
benchmarks and find out what's what when
we do but that's what I'd guess ok
interesting question here personal
question these are always good hopefully
you know asking how tall I am
why does Steve look and feel like an
Aussie okay while Tim is really a well
behaved disciplined bloke who doesn't
even feel Aussie I'm going to need a
moment to process that one so I'm not
even sure whether I should be offended
by this question or I'm just a little
confused so yeah I'm I come across as
very much an Aussie bloke I don't know
why and I don't know why Tim doesn't
Tim's very much a straight shooter
very technical doesn't mess around or
beat around the bush just gets straight
into the information so maybe that's a
nice sort of joke around a bit more
maybe a bit more lighthearted I think
that's possibly also an age thing like I
said I'm almost about 11 years older
than Tim so yeah I think when I was
younger like Tim I probably would've
been a bit similar to Tim but yeah not
sure what to take away from that one but
I do like
to joke around and mess around a bit and
be a bit light-hearted and you know
because it is very technical stuff and
sometimes it can be quite serious I try
to have fun with it and you guys seem to
enjoy that and Jim does do a bit of that
as well but yeah I I don't really have
an answer for that question so maybe tim
has more insight I don't know wish you
was here because he'd really enjoy that
one I think yeah so we'll move on I
think it's fair foxes the next one
it's an about size one and a half font
here we go how many hours do you guys
play video games on a monthly basis
well we've answered this one before
though I don't think I've answered it
probably as well as I could have I had a
bit more of a think about it because it
really depends on when you're asked I
think last time I was asked to this
question was in summer I was doing a lot
of fishing building things outside and I
really wasn't playing many video games
occasionally I'd catch up with some old
friends and we play some games but yeah
quite rare over summer however now we're
in winter and I found myself playing
daily quite a bit probably not much over
the next few weeks again it depends what
we have work load wise but certainly I
play more over winter I would say on
average at least one hour a day
I think Tim plays more than that all
year round I don't actually remember his
answer but I'd say it's a couple of
hours for Tim but again it depends on
his workload but he probably averages an
hour or two every day maybe more maybe
he can even drop a comment below to to
clear that one up but anyway sad Tim's
not here missed him on this one
tomorrow I will have a part to QA and
that will be answering our patreon
questions there's a heck of a lot of
those so hopefully I can get through all
of them by myself hopefully there's not
too many monitor related questions that
I'll need Tim for maybe I can get him to
write a script for me or something if
there is but anyway that's that's part
one of this month's Q&amp;amp;A so hopefully you
guys enjoyed that hopefully I answered
your question or a question that you
wanted to see answered and hopefully the
next two weeks aren't too brutal on the
benchmarking but I'm keen to get into it
and I'm really excited to see what we
have in store
with Zen to Navi and whatever it is in
video have planned as well no real
details on that yet either at this point
so yeah anyway thank you for watching
I'm your host Steve like subscribe
support us on discord if know support us
on patreon if you want access to our
discord and monthly live streamers which
we were meant to do today but Tim six so
sorry patreon members we will make it up
to you with a bonus one in the next few
weeks alright thank you for watching I'm
your host Steve I'll see you again next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
