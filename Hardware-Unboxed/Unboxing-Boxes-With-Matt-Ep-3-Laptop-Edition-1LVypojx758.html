with Matt as you can see we've got quite
a lot to get through today so first take
a look through this hyperx booties bag
so actually I to get this in the mail I
should have gotten had an event but I
wasn't able to make it down nice the
first up we got a big hyperx fury desk
mat which all up plain black box no idea
what in here very cool hyperx drink
bottle in tiny
it's like a three and a half mil cable
extender the suction cup of touch works
fine here we got a headset hanger which
is pretty nifty I really know how that
attaches to the wall or suction cup
again Oh 16 gig USB she looks pretty
good quality really quality USB 3 and
laughs
you know to the white box to gun a
little hyper x screw gun I don't know
how to use it that needs batteries and
is not included gone forever another
drill bit so I worked out this thing
doesn't actually take batteries but I've
got some cool things so you pop you flip
out but a few little drill bits there
and you think four plus the one in there
will be 20 buck spin this pops out a few
more alien style alright next all right
let me attach this big box
obviously you can probably see it's from
edifier and it's a set of speakers the
new s1000d be set and they look pretty
damn good from what i've seen them into
me a little remote control you have the
cables and i'll pull one of the speakers
out now that bloody heavy all right this
is one of the speakers we see two
drivers there they look really nice I
feel very high quality so we can fold a
setting these up and see how they sound
alrighty next pop open this razor box do
not sin here we've got a couple of
stickers as usual and here it's a tiny
little thin razor blade laptop so this
is actually equipped with the pretty
sure the 970 em from Nvidia pretty sleek
pretty small looking forward to testing
this thing out all right now pop having
this plastic here I've got a portable
wireless music player so it's little
bluetooth speaker get a lot of requests
for more budgets are a little more
budget style stuff so that's why I got
this thing in I think it's only twenty
bucks so be very interesting to see what
the sound actually like there you have
it the sardine all right I'm gonna see
who this one's from guess I'm cutting
towards themselves
cool so I've got the new Nexus mouse
shall be reviewing probably next week or
possibly the week after it's got a new
pics art center in it so be very keen to
check that one out all right last couple
of items over this thing first all right
here we've got my new radian rxt 462
gigabyte model so the model I already
reviewed was the much more expensive for
gigabyte model back in this thing comes
in a much better price point so be
comparing those shortly and you guys can
see for yourselves come with me while we
do a little plastic feeling so the plan
with this card isn't actually to review
it I'm going to do a four gig versus to
get comparisons so you really see the
difference or check out that plastic
suspect this is going to be much better
price per frame all right last box right
here got a new asus republic gaming
laptop so it's not equipped with one of
the new password cards as far as i know
i believe it is a new model so still
very keen to check this thing out look
at that sexy wrong in very nice looking
gaming laptop so we're looking forward
to putting that reviews games as well
