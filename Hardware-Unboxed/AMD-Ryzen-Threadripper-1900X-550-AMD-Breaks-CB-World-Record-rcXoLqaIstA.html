do
you guys are sitting there pretty much
just thinking for at least the
benchmarks already I mean we've known
about rise and thread Ripper for some
time now but anybody seems hell-bent on
spoon-feed against information once
every few weeks or so it really started
at Computex we were wowed with a few
menacing-looking x3 99 motherboards and
of course AMD announced that the cpus
would pack an insane 64 PCIe lanes
unheard of for a desktop processor even
an extreme high-end desktop processor at
the time we also knew that there would
be an 18 core 32 thread monster and that
quad channel ddr4 memory would be on
offer then more recently AMD released
further details regarding the models now
known as thread rip at 1950 x and 1920 x
today AMD's letting a few more details
out of the bag and this is why you're
watching
yet another thread Ripper video that
talks about thread Ripper without
actually having anything in hand so
again sorry about that there are however
a few juicy details to discuss and I can
thankfully tell you guys that my review
will be coming on the 10th of August so
that's next Thursday all the benchmarks
all the stuff you've been waiting for
we'll be out then so not too long the
wait now before then I will be unboxing
a thread Ripper I'm extremely excited
about that that'll be on the next
episode of unboxing boxes later this
week so stay tuned for that
yeah at least now you know that the
review is on the way soon the 10th of
August not too long to wait now ok so
let's go over some information AMD
released over the weekend and is now
allowing us to share with you today
AMD started by saying Rison is seeing
the return of innovation for
high-performance pcs and while that is
indeed true the success of Verizon has
also allowed the company to increase
their research and development budget
which will see innovation continue and
hopefully at an even faster rate they
also say that Rison has injected
excitement back into pcs and I have to
fully agree with that it's really nice
being out a review CPUs again
than just recommend whatever it is that
the blue team's offering next up we have
a look at the rising road map and here
we can see that once aim to execute
their thread Ripper launch next week all
attention will turn to the mobile AP use
in the fourth quarter of this year so
that's exciting indeed and it will see
Tim become quite busy and also keen to
check out the desktop ap use but
presumably they won't be arriving till
next year
I thought they were going with shed
super high-end desktop but so far I've
only seen AMD refer to their extreme
desktop platformers hey GDG which stands
for high-end desktop okay so we know
thread Ripper is a high-end desktop
platform offering greater memory support
and bandwidth along with a vastly
superior connectivity and expansion
thanks to all those extra PCIe lanes we
also know that when compared to Intel's
Core x-range thread Ripper will be very
competitive in terms of pricing we even
know it will come in a fancy package so
that should make the unboxing experience
all the more exciting moving on nothing
really new was said about the 1950 X in
1920 X but aim D did release a few
slides that show the kind of performance
gains consumers can expect to see over
the competing Intel parts in
applications such as Premiere Pro and
handbrake for example based on the
numbers seen here the 1950 X will have
the core oh nine 7900 X well and truly
beaten so will be interesting to see how
they compare in our review on the 10th
meanwhile it looks like the 1920 X will
deliver similar performance to the 17900
X at a twenty percent price saving now
the new CPU to get announced here is the
thread Ripper 1900 X a CPU many of us
were anticipating but it's now
officially been announced this is
basically arising seven CPU for the X
399 platform but with a few key upgrades
like the 1920 X in 1950 X the 1900 X
gets quad-channel memory support and
crucially 64 PCIe lanes like the Rison 7
CPUs it will boast eight cores and
sixteen threads and operate at a base
clock frequency of 3.8 yoghurts with a
full gigahertz boost speed it will be
coming in at 550 dollars u.s. which is
obviously quite a hefty price premium
over the base model horizon 7 1700 but
again you do get it on AMD's flagship
platform when
compared on paper with the core i7 78
20x the 1900 X offers the same amount of
cores and threads 5% more cache the same
quad channel memory support but more
than twice as many PCIe lanes it's also
likely to cost around 10% less given the
suggested retail prices AMD then moved
on to show their superior performance
per watt based on the blender
application results and based on their
testing the 1950 X was 24% faster than
the quarry 970 900 X while drawing 2
percent less power from the wall and
presumably they did use the same power
supply for both systems there is said to
be a full ecosystem of X 399
motherboards at launch and I should have
models from asrock gigabyte and msi for
my day 1 coverage there will also be a
range of 180 watt liquid and air-cooled
cooling solutions to choose from
and it looks like existing coolers can
be adapted to the massive thread Ripper
CPUs using an AM for 2 tier 4 adapter
which has been manufactured by a stack
and will be supplied with a thread rep
receiver use presumably though for the
best results you will want a large base
plate on the cooler finally at the event
over the weekend AMD did have a life
thread Ripper overclocking demo where
they hit 5.2 gigahertz using Allen - and
broke the Cinebench r15 world record
with a score of 4122 points not bad eh
of course on air or liquid I expect a
similar Headroom to what we've already
seen with horizon 7
speaking of size some interesting
information surfaced this week the
thread Ripper CPUs actually feature for
physical dyes though two of them are
disabled but I had assumed this was the
case anyway given the evidence at hand
but it's now been confirmed as I said in
my previous thread Ripper video these
CPUs pack 2 Zeppelin dies the ethic
server grain chips for example use 4 of
these days but like epic the Red River
uses the same TR for socket and that
means the CPUs have the same incredible
4000 94 pins
so basically thread Ripper is an epic
CPU with two of the Zeppelin dies
disabled and that makes it kind of like
what risin 5 1400 is - maybe like risin
7 1700 for example anyway that's going
to do it for this thread Ripper update
ahem glad this will be the last time I
touch on the subject without actually
having a CPU in hand that so I felt was
worth making this video to inform you
guys that there will be a five hundred
and fifty dollar u.s. eight core option
in the nineteen hundred X and that model
will go on sale later this month so
that's going to do it for this one I am
going to get out of here and get back to
the rise and three benchmarking overheat
to do still and I'm hoping to put up a
video probably after that unboxing and
boxes episode that I'm so excited about
but yet
big rise and three benchmark video
coming this week I'm your host Steve see
you next time guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
