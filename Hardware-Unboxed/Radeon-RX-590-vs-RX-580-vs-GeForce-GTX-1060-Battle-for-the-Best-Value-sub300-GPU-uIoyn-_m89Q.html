checking out the newest Radeon rx 590 on
hand for testing we have this fat boy
the XFX Radeon rx 590 fat boy anyway we
have a new rx 500 series GPU and it is
technically new but kind of not new at
the same time and what we have here is
the Polaris 20 xt architecture on the 12
nanometer FinFET process and this small
change means slightly better clock
speeds so bit of an overclock going on
there isn't any additional stream
processors there's no fancy GDD are six
memory or even gddr5 X memory for that
matter so yeah essentially what we have
here is an Rx 580 on steroids
well the 12 nanometer FinFET process for
a 15% overclock same thing right this is
a somewhat misleading statistic though
as most entry-level RX 5 ad models are
clocked at 1382 1400 and 10 megahertz
giving the new rx 590 at 10 to maybe 12
% clock speed advantage then there's the
higher-end models like the gigabyte or
SRX 5/8 extr which we use for testing
and that particular model comes clocked
at 1400 and 25 megahertz and that
reduces the rx5 90s clock speed
advantage to just 8% I also felt like it
would be a bit misleading for us to
compare the RX 590 with a base model rx
580 using AMD's reference clocks given
its price tag AMD's mess to this launch
up in my opinion by pricing the RX 590
at 280 dollars us yep that is
unfortunately the MSRP for this slightly
overclocked rx 580 meanwhile the RX 580
comes at an MSRP of $230 us but right
now can be easily had for $200 us AMD is
claiming up to a 12 percent boost over
the reference clock to our x5 ATS and I
have no idea how they think that means
they can increase the MSRP by 22 percent
doesn't quite add up for us so this
could be an interesting review
perhaps upsetting depending on your
position so for this testing I'm using
the XFX Radeon rx 590 Fatboy and it will
be compared to the gigabyte or SRX 580
XJR and msi geforce gtx 1060 gaming X
plus I haven't had time to update my
results for any lower end models such as
any rx 570 or three gigabyte GTX 1060
cards so this will have to do for now
that said I do have some higher-end
models for comparison as usual I'm using
our corsair GPU test system inside the
crystal series 570 x with the core i7
8700 k clocked at 5 gigahertz and then
32 gigabytes of vengence ddr4 3400
memory internal I have tested 21 games
but due to limited time I'm going to
discuss the results for just seven of
the games and they will be for the more
newly-released titles and then I'll
break down the data for all the games
towards the end of the video I'll also
include all 42 graphs over on our
patreon page so feel free to check those
out if you're interested the link will
be in the video description and that'll
just delay to have a closer look at all
the results anyway let's get into it
first up we have the battlefield 5
results and here the XFX 590 was 7%
faster than the Auris 580 xt are taking
the average frame rate from 85 fps to 91
fps not exactly earth-shattering stuff
but given the specs these were the kind
of margins that I was expecting to see
disappointingly that margin is reduced
to just three percent at 1440p though
they spent the 590 was 20% faster than
the GTX 1060 and that is the 9 gigabits
per second gaming x+ model from msi no
less moving on we have the strange
brigade results and at 1080p the new 590
was just 5% faster than the 580 though
this did make at 16 percent faster than
gtx 1060 at 1440p we see the same 5
percent margin here the 590 provided
just an additional 3 FPS over the or SRX
v 8 extr so again not exactly really
exciting stuff here the Assassin's Creed
series has been a bit brutal for AMD
recently and Odyssey is no different
here the 580 and 590 are easily beaten
by the gtx 1060 at 1080p we find a
similar story at 1440p here the 5 no
was 7% slower than the GTX 1060 and just
6% faster than the 580 which equates to
just two extra frames this is my first
time ever benchmarking with hitman
perhaps we'll have a big benchmark video
for this title soon I'll see how I go
for time anyway shame that the first
time I'm using this Tyler isn't for a
more exciting occasion here the 590
offered a 5 percent performance bump
over the 580 and that meant that it was
11 percent faster than 10 60 at 1080p
then at 1440p the margin between the 580
and 590 s reduces us to FPS a 4 percent
performance advantage going the way of
the 590 another 5 percent performance
gain is seen in shadow of the Tomb
Raider here the 590 rated 63 fps on
average opposed to the 580 s 60 fps then
at 1440p we see just a single frame
advantage going to the 590 that said it
was 14% fast and the gtx 1064 horizon
for played really well on the RX 590 at
1080p as frame rates never dip below 80
fps that said we are only looking at a 6
percent performance improvement over the
RX 580 only we did see a 10 percent
performance boost 1440p and I suspect
with a more reference clocked 580 and
see more double-digit gains like this
and we'll look at this in a moment of
the 21 games I've tested the last one
we're going to discuss is the results
for monster hunter world tourney P we
see another unexcited 4 percent
performance gain over the 580 though the
590 was 10% faster the GTX 1060 then at
1440p we see a single extra frame and I
don't know about you but that's about
all the single digit gains I can handle
for one video I suspect you're likely
going to come across a few reviews
showing more impressive gains for the RX
590 over the 580 than what we've seen in
this video so let's underclock the Auris
rx 580 exterior and run at the AMD spec
which calls for a boost clock speed of
1300 and 40 megahertz doing so reduces
the rx 580 performance in battlefield 5
at 1080 P by just 2% not exactly a
massive reduction but it means the RX
590 is now 10% faster at 1440p we do see
a larger 5 percent performance reduction
for the under clocked rx 580 and now the
590 is 8 percent faster a much more
pressive Marge and we compared to the
three percent advantage and enjoy it
over the our x58 extr running in its
out-of-the-box trim overclocking the XFX
fat boy landed us a core clock speed of
60 120 megahertz with a gddr5 memory
frequency of two thousand two hundred
and fifty megahertz resulting in a
transfer speed of 90 beats per second
this boost of performance in battlefield
5 at 1080 P by 4 percent while similar
gains were seen at 1440p I should just
point out that this is a retail card and
not a cherry-picked card by AMD that
said I have heard that most cards
struggle hitting 1600 megahertz so be
interesting to see what other reviewers
got now please note the Auris RX 5 80
XTi is a power-hungry 580 model it uses
around 10% more power than a more
standard 580 that said we see that the
new rx 590 model from XFX pushes total
system consumption slightly higher and
that resulted in a 42% increase over the
gtx 1060 configuration that's obviously
no small difference realistically a
power supply won't have an issue with
this increase and you're not exactly
going to notice it on your power bill
either unless your game 24/7 the only
real issue here is dealing with the
extra heat that's dumped in your case if
you have a well ventilated case than it
is less of an issue but for budget
builds this will heat things up quite a
bit
speaking of heat under load the Fatboy
peaked at 79 degrees which is reasonable
but is also starting to get up there the
good news is at this temperature it was
relatively silent as the fans rarely
spinning and up to thirteen hundred and
eighty rpm overclocking actually reduced
the temperature to 78 degrees as the
fans in our spinning and up to 1600 rpm
and they could now be heard over the
case fans the operating volume wasn't
unacceptable or anything crazy but it
was a little bit louder and it certainly
wasn't anywhere near as loud as a Vega
reference card for example ok so now for
a breakdown of all the games and on
average we see that the XFX Radeon rx
590 fat boy was 5 percent faster than
the gigabyte horas our x58 extr
so you can probably expect a 7 to 8
percent performance margin over a more
standard rx 580 not exactly
earth-shattering star
and it doesn't exactly bode well for the
five 90s higher price tag then when
compared to the msi gtx 1060 gaming x+
the XFX 590 was 8% faster on average at
tourney p and we see that the new radeon
GPU was slower in just four of the 21
games tested and those titles were the
witcher 3 Ghost Recon wildlands World of
Tanks and Assassin's Creed Odyssey the
590 enjoyed its biggest wins in dirt for
battlefield 5 and vermintide 2 then when
compared to Vega 56 the RX 5 9 it was
24% slower on average and given that it
costs 38% less that actually bodes quite
well for the new rx 590 in a cost per
frame comparison and we will look at
that data in a moment before we do
though here's a quick look at how the
590 stacks up against the more expensive
gtx 1070 here it was 19% slower on
average so depending on the titles you
play the gtx 1070 can be a significant
upgrade or well not much of an upgrade
at all now the last graph that we have
to check out is the cost per frame
breakdown coming in first place by a
country mile as the RX 588 gigabyte
models right now can be had for $200
u.s. which is a super purchase not that
long ago gamers would have sacrificed a
finger for a price like that on a
mid-range graphics card the gtx 1060
right now is also down at the $250 MSRP
though the 9 gigabits per second models
are likely going to cost a little bit
more but honestly that seems to be a
gimmick for the most part we never saw
much of a performance uplift over these
standard models in any case the RX 580
cost 20% less per frame making it the
obvious choice here the RX 590 is far
less appealing at the 280 dollar MSRP
that sees it come out at a cost of $4
per frame making it 32% more expensive
on a cost per frame basis so that's
really not much better than the 40%
extra you can expect to pay in total as
a hypothetical for 250 dollars the RX
590 should start to make sense but above
that it's a pretty exciting product I'd
much rather spend $100 more and get
myself a gtx 1070 or a little bit more
again and get a 1070 TI
i can't work out what's disappointed me
the most the MSRP of the RX 590 or the
that XFX didn't name it super edition I
guess they're both equally upsetting
performance-wise the RX 590 was always
going to be a bit lackluster I mean
overclocking the RX 5/8 is really only
going to get you so far the big issue
here the real killer for this product at
least for me is the 280 dollar US MSRP
at that price it's my opinion that no
one should really consider this product
at all it's basically dead on arrival
I'm just hoping this is a situation
where AMD introduces the radio Erik's
590 at $280 u.s. and then before too
long heavily acts as pricing down to
$250 US or while I'm being wishful let's
go a little bit lower but I think toy
review dollars us is reasonable at least
at that price it does match the gtx 1060
while offering superior performance and
that should make it the obvious choice
for budget gamers and i think at the
very least AMD needs to well at least
match in video on pricing the RX 590
might consume more power and while not
ideal it makes up for that with a
healthy ecosystem of affordable freesync
monitors and an extra two gigabytes of
vram its biggest problem right now as I
said is the $200 RX 5 80s and the
biggest problem the $200 RX 5 80s face
is the 150 dollar RX 5 70s and appears
as though AMD's am doing themselves
I really am baffled by AMD on this one
they've put together some flashy
marketing slides claiming stuff like 12%
faster versus rx 580 and while possible
if you're comparing reference models
it's not an accurate reflection of the
real-world situation and we're still
given this best-case scenario by their
own numbers the RX 590 makes absolutely
no sense
awesome it's up to 12% faster for a
guaranteed 22% increase in price when
comparing MSRP s what a winner
anyway the RX 590 it's certainly not a
bad product it just comes at a really
bad price in my opinion and I think it's
safe to say that gamers have had more
than enough of that this year new
graphics card
released in 2018 that have bad prices so
it's become a boring theme and I'm
hoping that we can make the theme of
2019 new graphics cards at really good
prices get my fingers crossed for that
one but I won't hold my breath
anyway that is gonna do it for this one
actually no sorry
rewind quickly I do need to thank
someone a big thank you to PC case gear
for supplying our review sample that we
have here so this is an actual retail
cut was it handpicked by AMD or anything
like that
MD weren't able deliver one on time so
with permission PC case gear came to the
rescue and provided of this very card
here so if you're a Z considering
getting a new graphics card then please
check out PC case key I will provide a
link to their website in the video
description and finally if you enjoyed
this review then subscribe for more
content if you haven't already if you
appreciate the work with your our box
then consider supporting us on patreon
and remember you can find all the graphs
for the 21 games tested at 30 pay and
1440p over on patreon page and it's free
for anyone to look at so the link for
