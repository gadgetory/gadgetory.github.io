going to take a look at the risin v 3600
and thanks to our patreon community we
were able to purchase this processor for
a reasonably early review and we can do
that rather than waiting for AMD to
provide them at a later date not quite
sure when AMD is providing these CPUs
but rather wait we've gone out and
bought one so a big thank you to
everyone who supports us directly so
there isin 5 3600 is a 6 chord 12 thread
CPU that clocks between 3.6 Q Hertz and
4.2 gigahertz it features a 32 megabyte
l3 cache and a 65 watt TDP included in
the package is the Wraith stealth cooler
and AMD has set the MSRP at just $200 so
it's the same launch price as the r5
2600 which was $20 less than the
original v 1600 the primary competition
for the r5 3600 comes from the Intel
Core i5 9600 the non K model which costs
two hundred and thirteen dollars u.s.
but since we don't have that part and it
doesn't appear to be on sale the more
expensive 9600 K will have to do it
costs two hundred fifty-five dollars
u.s. and it doesn't include a box cooler
therefore in terms of pricing Intel's
already on the back foot so it'll be
interesting to see how they stack up
when it comes to the benchmarks speaking
of which the MSI x5 70 creation was used
for testing I know it's an overkill
motherboard it's certainly not necessary
a B 450 board will work just fine but I
want to use the same test setup that I
did for the other rise and processors so
this means the rise in fire for 3,600
was tested on the same x5 70 board and
it's been configured with the same ddr4
3200 cell 14 memory and I used the
included box cooler for the review of
the CPU as well then the eighth and
ninth gen Intel Core processors were
benchmarked on the gigabyte is at 390 or
ultra using the same ddr4 3200 cell 14
memory but they were cooled using the
corsair hydro series h 115 i RGB
platinum 200 millimeter all-in-one
liquid cooler please note the intel cpus
are not TDP restricted as that's not the
out of the box experience so we're
showing the absolute best case scenario
out-of-the-box performance with the
Intel processors but please note I'll
also be factoring in the cost of an
aftermarket cooler for the Intel CPUs in
the cost analysis at the end of this
video and it works out to be in AMD's
favored to use the Box cooler as using
an aftermarket solution really only
boost gaming performance by one to two
percent
please note I have removed the higher
and more expensive CPU such as the 3900
X 9700 k91 RK for a group of 29 20x and
core i7 7900 X as they aren't really
relevant we're looking at a $200 CPU but
you can cross-reference the results from
our earlier third gen rising review if
you like finally the graphics card of
choice is the MSI trio GeForce artex
2080 ti okay I think that covers
everything let's get into the benchmark
results as usual we'll start off with
the Cinebench our twenty multi-core test
and right away I'm pretty blown away by
the 3600 s performance here it matched
the Rison seven 1800 X with just over
3,600 points yep the 3600 scored roughly
3,600 points amazing but let's move on
this made at four percent faster than
the 8700 K almost twenty percent faster
in the 2600 X and 28% faster than the
model it's replacing the 2600 then when
compared to the r5 1600 the new 3600 is
45% faster that's pretty insane
in two years AMD has increased
performance at the $200 price point by
almost 50% the single core performance
is equally impressive here the 3600 was
just 4% slower than the 3700 X and that
meant it was able to match the core i5
9600 K and just edged out the 8700 K
moving on to WinRAR and here we see the
r5 3600 looks very good falling just
short of the 8700 K by a mere 4% margin
that made at 45% faster than the core i7
77 or okay and rise in 720 700 X so some
pretty incredible gains here for the
third gen Rison part again this time
when testing with 7-zip
we see the 3,600 beating the 2700 X the
compression performance really is
nothing short of amazing and met the
3600 was 14%
the 8700 K it did fall behind the older
eight Corazon processes in the
decompression test but even so it was
still 16 percent faster than the 8700 K
for budding content creators the r5 3600
will be a godsend for just $200 it
completed our 4k workload four percent
faster than the 8700 K and while that's
far from a significant margin
remember the 8700 K is a 360 US dollar
processor interestingly the 3600 does
come up short again against the ad700 K
in the latest version of the VRA
benchmark here it was 6% slower but
again given the difference in price
that's hardly a bad result for AMD still
when compared to the r5 2600 it was 17%
faster and a whopping 32% faster than
the r5 1600 they're moving along once
again AMD's new six core CPU trailed the
87 ROK by a small margin in the corona
benchmark so given the difference in
price this is still a very good result
for the 3600 it did manage to pull ahead
for the blender test here it was just a
single percent faster than the 87 ok so
basically the same result but that is
still clearly a very good result for
AMD's new $200 desktop processor but
perhaps more impressive are the total
system power consumption figures we
recorded when running the blender
benchmark as you can see the r5 3600
consume the same amount of power as the
quad core Core i7 77 okay and only
slightly more than the 9600 K now you
might think consuming slightly more
power the 9600 K isn't that impressive
but remember the 3600 was almost 40%
faster than the Core i5 processor in
this test so in terms of power
efficiency it's extremely impressive
okay time for gaming and first up we
have Assassin's Creed Odyssey and here
the 3600 slightly edged out the 8700 K
is one percent low result despite being
a few frames slower on average still you
can very much cool what we're seeing
here 8700 K light performance for the
new horizon 5 3600 so again that is a
big win for AMD as far as I'm concerned
like what we saw with the 3900 X and
3700 X review the third gen rise and
processors do slip a little in this
title at 1440p
and this is
also true for the r5 3600 here at 6%
smile nearly 700 K not a massive margin
but normally you'd expect things to
close up at 1440p the battlefield 5
results are again a little disappointing
though I have to remind myself the 3600
isn't competing with the 8700 K its
target is the 9600 K and here it
improves 1% low performance by 23% so an
easy win for the new risin 5 processor
even at 1440p despite the 9600 K
appearing quicker when looking at the
average framerate the 1% low performance
of the 3600 was actually 18% higher and
this allowed it to deliver a smoother
and more consistent gaming experience
next up we have shut off the Tomb Raider
and here's a 3600 matched the 9600 K
which is a very solid result given the
9600 K costs more and requires you to
purchase a cooler separately the 1440p
results were much the same the 9600 K
did creep ahead by a few frames but
overall performance was competitive and
the 1% low performance of the 3600 was a
good bit faster than any of these 2nd
gen rising parts moving on to the
division 2 and here at 1080p the 3600
edged out the 9600 K and made a
significant step forward from not just
the 2600 X but also the 2700 X
interestingly though this time at 1440p
the 3600 was able to pull further ahead
of the 9600 K namely when looking at the
1% low performance in fact the 3600
matched the 3700 X and that man it was a
good bit faster in the 2,700 X and 8700
K as we've come to expect from horizon
the performance in Far Cry new dawn was
a bit disappointing at least relative to
the competing Intel processors and
overall performance was still very good
and the game plate was incredibly smooth
even at 1440p the 3600 is still well
down on the 9600 okay
particularly when looking at the 1% low
results performance in World War Z was
also low relative to the Intel CPUs but
of course with well over 100 FPS at all
times it probably doesn't matter too
much in this instance interestingly the
rice and CPUs create some kind of
performance bottleneck in this title and
we see what looks to be a 135 FPS Kappa
1440p it's very odd that considering the
Intel CPUs pushed up to
and 50 FPS Verizon 5 3,600 was solid
enrage to averaging 100 60 FPS and this
meant it wasn't a great deal slower than
the 9600 K moreover the 3600 was fast
enough to find the limits of the r-tx
2082 at 1440p though this was true of
almost all the CPUs tested this time
when testing with hitman 2 we see the
3600 was 7% slower than 92,000 ok when
looking at the average framerate not a
massive difference but again this isn't
a great title for the rise in CPUs we
find similar results at 1440p though
here the 3600 basically matched the 1%
low performance of the 96 and ok
I don't over all the gaming experience
was indistinguishable between these 2
CPUs finishing up the gaming benchmarks
we have Total War three kingdoms and he
the 3600 offered stronger 1% low
performance than the 96 on our K but it
did also provide slightly lower average
frame rates but once again the jump to
1440p with the RT x 20 80 TI we see the
performance margins are neutralized and
here the 9600 K and 3600 enabled the
same level of performance as was the
case with the 3700 X and 3900 X there's
very little overclocking Headroom to
speak of with the 3600 the best I could
do with an all-in-one liquid cooler was
a 4.2 gigahertz or Core overclock so
again you're best off enabling PBO plus
the order OC feature in the rise and
master software this boosted the
Cinebench r20 multi-core score by a mere
4% here we say that the PBA plus order
OC overclock improved the single core
score by just one and a half percent so
I suspect most won't bother with
overclocking as it's not really worth
the added heat speaking of which let's
check out the thermal performance of the
included Wraith stealth box cooler with
the race stealth install the 3600
maintained a 4 gigahertz clock speed out
of the box during a one-hour long
blender stress test this is an extreme
stress test so the fact that it peaked
at just 80 degrees is actually pretty
good especially given it was virtually
silent
you can enable PBO with the Box cooler
but it won't do much as you're already
near the thermal limit so basically we
gain just 25 megahertz for a 4 degree
increase in temperature that big in the
case I don't recommend using PBO with
the Box cooler
with a decent cooler installed
temperatures were dropped quite
significantly you really don't need
something as Extreme as the Corsair
hydro Series edge 115 i 280 millimeter
all-in-one liquid cooler but I did use
that for the 3,700 X and I wanted to
make these results comparable for future
content anyway with the a i/o installed
these stock temps drop to just 62
degrees and now by default the 3600 ran
at 4,000 125 megahertz so a 3% order
overclock then with PBO enabled we got
another 85 megahertz and this increased
the load temp to 68 degrees which is
obviously still very cool okay so now
that we've seen how the new risin 530
600 performs in a range of applications
and games it's time to work out just how
good it is in terms of value so let's go
do that right now
for the cost per frame data we're adding
the cost of the cooler to the Intel
systems I believe a $45 budget for the
cooler master hyper 212 Black Edition is
very reasonable with those adjustments
made the core i5 9600 K comes in at a
total cost of $295 us and that means the
cost per frame figure is two dollars and
18 cents which places it on par with the
horizon 720 700 X the horizon 530 600
comes out significantly more affordable
at just $1 53 per frame as it delivers a
similar level of performance but costs
almost $100 less this makes the 3600
better values in the 2600 X at its
current $195 asking price though it is
18 percent more costly than the vanilla
2600 even so given the improvements in
efficiency and the absolutely a
monstrous performance uplift in
productivity workloads I feel it's going
to be easy for consumers to justify that
small price premium well there you have
it as predicted the horizon 530 600
offers a tremendous amount of value and
because it just sips power it'll work on
even the most basic be 350 motherboard
providing it receives the necessary BIOS
update alternatively for new builders
you can grab my favorite be 450 board
the MSI be 450 tomahawk and you'll have
a killer combo for a smidgen over $300
u.s. and that's that's basically what
you'll pay for a 9600 K with a mid-range
cooler then in the few
your options are aplenty the horizon 730
700x the horizon 930 900 X or maybe even
the 16-core 39 50 X who knows what
secondhand deals will be available in
these parts in a few years time this is
why I've been such a big proponent of
AMD's a m4 platform those who bought in
two years ago with an affordable be 350
motherboard and say the Rison v 1600 for
example you now have the option of
slotting in the r5 3600 for up to a 35
percent performance boost in games and
at least a 45 percent boost in
applications though as we saw in WinRAR
it can be over a 100 percent boost but
as I alluded to a moment ago even for
those building a new PC from the ground
up the r5 3600 looks to be the best
option it absolutely smoked the core i5
9600 K and every single application
benchmark where you ran and worst case
it matches its single core performance
you get 12 threads opposed to two six so
it's no doubt going to age better but
this time you don't have to roll a dice
on rise ins longevity as it's faster
today and sure the 9600 K was a little
faster and a few of the games tested but
the 3600 was miles faster where you'll
absolutely notice it so this one's
pretty cut and dry for me at least Intel
cuts pricing quite heavily I really
can't see a reason to consider their
processors particularly the mid-range
offerings such as the 9600 K and that's
going to do it for this one up next I'll
have some be 350 motherboard testing to
see just how well these third gen rise
and processes work on entry-level boards
I'll be throwing probably this one
definitely the 3700 X and 39 of X at
those boards obviously if they work this
little guy will as well baby way keep an
eye out for that should be pretty good
