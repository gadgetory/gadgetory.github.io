gaming K for motherboard an affordable
motherboard which as the name suggests
is aimed squarely at gamers one would
think the word fatality in the product
name would be enough of a hint that this
is a gaming focused product in case you
don't know who Jonathan Wendel is as
Rick made it blatantly obvious by adding
the word gaming with the global PC game
revenue surpassing consoles hitting over
90 billion dollars this year and the
gaming hardware market worth over 67
billion dollars in 2014 there's no
wonder everything from the humble
computer mouse to 30 inch plus monitors
having gaming slapped all over them
Gaming is big business and we can't
really criticize as rock for
capitalizing on the fact they certainly
aren't alone having said that though
what makes the vitality be 150 gaming K
for motherboard worthy of the name
for starters despite the surprisingly
low $100 asking price it looks very much
like a motherboard you would easily pay
$200 plus for quality features such as
the killer a 2400 network controller and
as rocks purities down three are
included not just that but crossfire X
is also on the menu this all sounds
great and frankly a little difficult to
comprehend given not just the board's
price but also the chipset used the key
to the fatality be 150 gaming K falls
affordability is inclusion of the Intel
be 150 chipset and the irony being that
this is a business chipset on a gaming
motherboard almost always gamers will
rule out any be 150 motherboard for a
few reasons
overclocking of any kind isn't supported
there are very few PCIe chipset lanes
multi-gpu technologies aren't supported
there are fewer USB 3 ports and
high-speed storage interfaces such as
SATA Express and m2 unsupported either
but wait a minute
the fatality be 150 gaming K 4 has
almost all of these things it really
isn't any legitimate reason why the be
150 chipset can't support most of these
features rather intel imposes these
limitations to make them more expensive
h1 70 and Zed 170 chipsets more
appealing to the consumer as a result
there are a number of be 150
motherboards from makers such as MSI and
gigabyte the support crossfire
along with SATA Express and m2 still
bang for your buck we don't think the
fatality be 150 gaming cash ball can be
beaten
it was previously unthinkable to find
features such as a tenth our phase
design Michigan 12 K platinum capacitors
are a quality 600 ohm headset amplifier
on such an affordable motherboard
although the crossfire support is
limited to pci u x 8 for the first card
x 4 for the second card this is still
more than enough bandwidth to get the
most out of a pair of flagship graphics
cards such as the fury x asrock has also
included a 4-pin molex connector onboard
which can connect directly to the power
supply providing more juice to the
graphics cards which they say helps
improve stability along with the 2 PCIe
x 16 slots there are also three PCIe x 1
slots all of which are flexible PCIe
slots meaning they can accommodate x 2
and x 4 length cards with limited
bandwidth unfortunately while affordable
be 150 motherboards such as the gigabyte
be 150 M d3h and MSI be 150 PC may both
support SATA Express and more
importantly m2 as Rox flagship be 150
motherboard supports neither instead
we're limited to the standard 6 SATA 6
gigabits per second ports but you have
to admit is disappointing granted
high-speed m2 storage isn't cheap but
who knows how affordable the samsung SSD
950 pro or an equivalent product would
be in 6 to 12 months so having the
option to upgrade to such a product
would have been nice an area where the
fatality be 150 gaming K 4 doesn't fall
short is in its memory support my
knowledge as it stands this is the only
be 150 motherboard that supports memory
overclocking thanks to as rocks noon on
Zed sky like overclocking BIOS update
there are a few catches however
primarily the fact that there are just
four memory modules that currently
support the be 150 the chances of you
having any of these modules if you're
carrying over parts from a previous
build very slim
assuming you have the appropriate memory
modules you'll have the rare ability to
run the memory at 2800 megahertz
whereas all other be 150 motherboards
from other makers are limited to 2133
megahertz is 30% increase in clock speed
won't have a significant impact on
performance but might help you net an
extra frame or two in game
moving on the killer a 2400 gigabit
network controller isn't something I
would have raved about and frankly I'm
just as happy with an Intel controller
that said cheaper h1 10 motherboards
almost always come with the low-end real
tech solution so in this case I'm very
happy to find the e 2400 on board gamers
will no doubt appreciate the automatic
gaming traffic prioritization feature of
the e 2400 I can confirm it works rather
well as mentioned earlier purity sound 3
is included on this motherboard and
that's a bit of a big deal
typically motherboards price at $100 or
less features subpar audio solutions
this isn't great news for gamers
however the purity sound 3 is driven by
the realtek ALC 1150 audio codec
supporting 7.1 channel high definition
audio along with other technologies such
as pure plug-in direct drive and DTS
connect other exciting features include
a ti and a 5 5 3 2 headset amplifier 115
decibel snr DAC with differential
amplifier and you can find gold series
audio cabs this audio solution is the
real deal and it's the same setup you'll
find on the 230 dollars
dead 170 extreme 7 + when it comes to
benchmarking we aren't gonna waste your
time by comparing the fatality be 150
gaming KFOR with other be 150 or other
intel 100 series motherboards for that
matter as is the case with all 100
series motherboard the memory
application and gaming performance is
very much the same
and with no CPU overclocking support
this isn't a performance feature that we
could test either had the board support
an m2 slot we would have tested that but
as it stands the side of performance is
as expected
while not super important it has to be
said that fatality be 150 gaming K 4 is
a seriously good-looking motherboard the
oversized red aluminium heat sinks look
great and more importantly do an
excellent job of keeping the
motherboards core components cool the IO
armor shield might only be a bit of
fancy looking plastic but we like it and
the matte black PCB finishes it off all
very well value for money you'll be
hard-pressed to find anything is good
let alone better for me Azeroth has
created what is almost a perfect budget
enthusiast motherboard in the fatality
be 150 game
okay for the only thing I would change
here is the storage configuration this
motherboard is just begging for an m2
slot high-speed nbme drives are going to
become plentiful next year never sighs
put there be 150 gaming m3 in a position
to capitalize on this we just wish
asrock I'd have done the same
still the lack of m2 support certainly
isn't a deal-breaker on a 100 dollar
motherboard now I understand the most
fatality be 150 game inkay for owners
will be more than content with the two
and a half inch SATA SSD such as the
crucial bx 200 or samsung 850 Evo one
possible issue is as rocks in your sky
OC feature which enables the
overclocking of non-chaotic processes on
any of their zeb 170 motherboards this
makes the as rocks dead 170 ax 13.1
considerably more attractive as you can
significantly overclock affordable
processes such as the core i3 6100 or
Core i5 6400 the z170a x1 3.1 also
features USB 3.1 and better multi GPU
support though it does still lack m2
support overall the Azeroth fatality be
150 gaming K 4 is an incredibly good
value motherboard which really made me
question how many gamers really need to
spend more than $100 on their
motherboard thanks for watching another
