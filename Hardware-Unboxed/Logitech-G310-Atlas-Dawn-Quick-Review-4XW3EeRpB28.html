your host Matt and today we're going to
be taking a look at logistics brand new
g3 10 Atlas dawn compact mechanical
gaming keyboard the g3 10 ounce dawn is
Logitech's latest instalments used their
patented romaji mechanical keys
following on from the g9 10a ryan spark
which we reviewed a few weeks ago these
romaji switches claim a 25% faster
actuation point as well as supreme
durability a lightweight build and
central backlighting for each key I did
like the Roma G switches the first time
we encountered them but I wouldn't say I
loved them and I really used the Orion's
box since then for other reasons so I've
been looking forward to giving the Atlas
door to go the most obvious point of
difference the g3 10 has is compact
design it completely figures the numpad
this is clearly a keyboard to gamers and
will really soothe those that travel
often or have limited space on their
desks back when I reviewed the Orion
spark I mentioned that I didn't think
the key caps were the best and a lot of
people agreed with me
the to supply Palmer s were also likely
in my opinion neither I'll fit much idol
size and I found myself wanting to go
back to the simpler higher adjustable
palm rest of the Cougar gaming keyboard
line disappointingly for me on the g3 10
the key caps are exactly the same as the
Orion spark and the palm rest may as
well be I don't think it's going to go
down well with a lot of reviewers and
users that agree with me last time
like the Orion spark the Atlas storm
supports logitech's RX control
integration software this involves
installing an app on your iOS or Android
device that can display in-game
information and system statistics and
more the keyboard again comes with a
dock which is removable this time and
I've gotta say I kind of like the dock
it kind of helps you be able to see your
phone notifications at a glance while
you're gaming but I wouldn't really
write home about the Eric software in
terms of usefulness although it does do
everything it says it does without any
real hitches and it looks pretty the key
backlighting isn't quite as Christmas
tree as it was on the Orion spark with
its uniform blue color you can still
control the brightness
the dedicated key to the top right of
the keyboard and Logitech software
allows you to finally tune this further
aside from that there's not too much to
report
I like the keyboards compact size
lightweight for easy traveling however
the key caps and polymers are again a
letdown for me the brim eg switches are
fine they feel pretty squishy in my
opinion as I expressed last time and the
tactile feedback doesn't compare to the
industry standard Cherry MX but I'll bet
some people absolutely love them and
enjoy the faster actuation and these
people should benefit from Logitech
exclaim 40% improved durability thanks
