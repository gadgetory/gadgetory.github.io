news corner what will be the final part
of our CES news roundup coverage to show
well it seems to have been pretty busy
as it always is both Steve and I have
very glad we did venture over to Las
Vegas to do with you know the noisy show
floor massive crowds packed schedules
that sort of thing
seems like covering this sort of event
from home is certainly the way to go
also before we get into the news topics
just want to say thanks to you guys for
all the support we've received over the
last couple of weeks firstly in relation
to the NB CES coverage and the whole
lead-up to that you might have seen me
receive quite a lot of negative feedback
on our various rumors about what AMD
will do a CES most of that I think was
from unreasonable fanboys but it
certainly was quite nice to hear support
from the vast majority of our regular
audience which are I guess more
reasonable people and secondly for the
overwhelming feedback we received on our
RT X 2060 video a few days ago where we
described how NVIDIA has basically
screwed us over on that one it's really
touching to hear how many of you
appreciate our coverage on these
launches and products we're still hoping
to work through that one with NVIDIA
obviously it's a busy time right now at
CES going on but I think the community
getting behind us is helping get the
message through to the right people so
yeah hopefully there'll be some progress
on that soon moving on to the actual
news topics Nvidia CEO Jenson Wong made
some really unusual I guess you'd have
to say comments to PC world in relation
to both AMD's upcoming Radeon seven
graphics card and free sync monitors
when speaking about the Radeon seven one
said its underwhelming before going on
to elaborate that the performance is
lousy and there's nothing new there's no
rate racing no AI it's seven animators
with HBM memory that barely keeps up
with a twenty eighty and if we turn on
DL SS we'll crush it and if we turn on
ray-tracing we'll crush it he also said
it's a weird launch maybe they thought
of it this morning now it's not unusual
for Jensen to come out and make these
sorts of statements about a competitor's
products but these ones are pretty funny
in my opinion mostly because there's
really no way
Nvidia would actually know that the card
barely keeps up with a twenty eighty
because
hasn't really been released they also
wouldn't know if performance is lousy of
course he's right that the Radeon seven
doesn't support rate racing but it seems
most people don't actually care about
that anyway so it's mostly just a load
of crap out of nvidia
ceo's mouth jensen also spoke a bunch of
crap about freesync monoliths claiming
freesync was never proven to work that
Nvidia invented the area of adaptive
sync and that they do not even work with
aim B's graphics cards now I can't say
I've tested every single adaptive sync
monitor on the market but I've certainly
tested a fair few at this point and
every single one has in fact worked the
issues in video showed off in their
keynote completely ridiculous in my
opinion I would certainly immediately
RMA a monitor if I ever saw those
problems especially things like
flickering and they're certainly not
indicative of the wider adaptive sync
monitor ecosystem so to say that most
freezing monitors don't work is a load
of fecal matter and I'd say a claim like
that is bordering on a complete lie so
hope people aren't actually taking their
statements seriously the other GPU news
to emerge in the last few days comes
from AMD CTO mark Papermaster in an
interview with the street key paper
master says that the company is really
excited to start on the high end without
7 nanometre Radeon 7 but crucially he
goes on to say and you will see the
announcements over the course of the
year as we refresh across our radeon
program
this indicates that AMD will indeed
release more radeon products in 2019
they're not just going to release the
Radeon 7 and call it a day
I guess this is an overly surprising
news we're still expecting Navi to
launch at some point likely towards the
back half of the year but it's nice to
get an actual statement from an AMD
executive that reiterates more GPS come
later down the line
intel has quietly pushed out more
ninth-generation processes and ant x
followed some new entries into intel's
and delt australia's databases that go
beyond the simple 6 new products we
talked about in news corner a few days
ago none of these products are super
interesting but we'll go over them
anyway we have the core i7 9700 is
basically a locked version of the 9700 K
at a 65 watt TDP and with the slightly
lower maximum frequency of 4.7 gigahertz
still on 8 cores without hyper threading
then
have the core i3 9100 a fork or four
thread CPU at up to 4.2 gigahertz again
locked at 65 watts
then there's the pentium g 54 20 a to
call four thread cpu at 3.8 gigahertz
even more strange is the core i3 80-100
F spotted in Intel's database it's a
core i3 8100 without night GPU of course
but it's interesting that they've
quietly pushed out an F model of the CPU
with eighth generation branding as
opposed to integrating it into their
ninth gen lineup then a whole lot of
other details on these processes but it
seems the Intel are intent on fleshing
out the 9th gen series with everything
from low-end pentium parts right up to
the 9900 K hard OCP has found a number
of AMD Radeon 7 benchmark numbers buried
in the footnotes of AMD's press release
and currently tabulated them for
everyone to see AMD tested both the
Radeon 7 and Vega 64 on an Intel Core i7
7700 K test rig with 16 gigabytes of
ddr4 3,000 memory running AMD driver
1850 and Windows 10 with every game
tested at 4k using maximum settings on
average you can see the Radeon seven is
around 29% faster across 25 games but
naturally there's a bit of a spread here
games like Forza horizon for hitman 2
and monster hunter world saves smaller
gains with hitman 2 delivering a
surprisingly low 7% uplift in a mb/s
testing then there are outliers on the
opposite end of the scale like a fall at
76 is 68% uplift and strange brigades
42% interestingly aimed at you strange
Brigade to show the Radeon 7 are
performing the RT X 2080 by a healthy
margin the other games AMD showed
battlefield 5 and 505 deliver more
modest 33 and 26% games respectively
over vega 64 most titles are around that
mark as well of course it's always worth
taking performance numbers from a
manufacturer with a grain of salt we
strongly encourage you wait for
independent reviews to verify how the
Radeon 7 performs before you go out and
buy one some interesting power supplies
have been spotted by an antic at CES
from one of the larger OD amps FSP while
not a known brand that sells directly to
consumers FSP manufacture a lot of power
supplies for these known brands at CES
have been demonstrating their line of
twin redundant
our supplies so these are basically a
standard ATX PSU form factor but inside
are two separate power supplies which
are automatically switched between in
the case one fails they also
hot-swappable so you can replace a
failed unit without powering down the
system handy for some niche use cases
the company already has 500 watt and 700
watt units and is working on a bigger
900 watt unit for higher end systems FSB
also showed off a liquid-cooled power
supply which just baffles me as to why
anyone would want or need that sort of
product they have a $700 1200 watt unit
and a $400 850 watt unit that will be
available near the end of q1 both of
which still have fans in the event the
liquid loop fails when the loop is
working the power ratings increase for
each power supply up to 1,400 watts and
a thousand watts respectively
they also say these units should be
installed in the top of the system just
in case again the loop fails having a
liquid core PSU just seems like a
disaster waiting to happen if something
goes wrong and liquid drips onto the
active components it could cause a short
circuit and blow stuff up really seems
like the last component you'd actually
want to liquid cool and it's not all
that necessary but whatever FSB has some
new units for those that do want
something like this we love their
benchmarks here at hardware in box so
it's good to hear there's another one
ready for our consumption in the form of
3d marks first
ray-tracing benchmark Port Royal we tend
not to use 3d mark for our GPU benchmark
videos because we like to stick to
real-world games but for those that do
want to test out the ray tracing ability
of their GPU especially their r-tx GPU
you can now download portroyal and give
it a try kit guru tested out the new
benchmark and got these results across
the RT x 2060 to RTX 2080 TI
unsurprisingly the RT x 2080 i has a bit
more than double the ray tracing
performance which makes sense because
nvidia writes the 28 ET is capable of 10
Giga rows per second competitors 5
degrees per second for the RT x 2060
toshiba has launched the first hard
drive with a 16 terabyte capacity called
the mg 0 8 series it's a 3.5 inch
helium-filled drive consisting of 9 1.7
terabyte platters Toshiba continues to
be the only company using nine platter
designs in 3.5 inch drives it also uses
two-dimensional magnetic rock
or TDM ah with thinner platters and TDK
developed heads
unfortunately there's no performance
numbers just yet but the drives are
rated for a 550 terabyte annualized
workload and had a 2.5 million hour MTBF
the drives also come with a five-year
warranty there's no firm word on price
or release date just yet mostly because
Toshiba says it will take about four to
six months to validate these drives with
their partners alright time for another
wave of monitor news first up we have
some new monitors from Lenovo we have
the Y 27 GQ which is the first 27-inch
1440p 240 Hertz monitor to hit the
market using a new panel from a
Optronics it's a TN panel of course to
hit that sort of refresh rate with the
response time listed of 0.5 milliseconds
there's also 90% DCI p3 coverage and
gsync and it's expected to hit the
market in April for around $1,000 so yep
that's pretty expensive Lenovo also has
the Y 44 W a 43 inch double wide monitor
with a resolution of 3840 by 1200 so
basically 2
16:10 panels side-by-side it comes with
a 144 Hertz refresh rate and freesync
plus it's ready for display HDR 400
it'll hit the market also in April for
$1,200 dell has joined in with to
monitor announcements at CES they'll be
the first company to release a laptop
with a 240 Hertz 1080p display that will
be available in March as a configuration
option for their Alienware m15 laptop
the company also has through their
Alienware brand a 55 inch oled gaming
display which i guess is more of a TV it
does support a 4k resolution at 120
Hertz plus some seriously decent HDR no
word on pricing release date just yet
but it does look quite interesting final
topic for this week the division 2 will
be available not on Steam but on the new
epic games store this is a pretty major
pick up for the epic game store which
seems to be attracting developers
through it's much higher cut of revenue
for developers compared to steam the
game was listed on steams to begin with
and Ubisoft will honor any purchases
that have been made through Steam but
since this announcement the game has
been removed in favor of a listing on
the epic games store along with Ubisoft
own you Play Store that's it for this
week's news corner
much just a straight week of news as you
might expect from CES time but we'll be
back with some non news coverage
tomorrow I think Steve's got something
interesting planned as always you can
