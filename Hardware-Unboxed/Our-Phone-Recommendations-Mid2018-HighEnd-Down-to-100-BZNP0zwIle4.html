box today's video is going to be a
little different to some of the stuff
that we normally do on the channels
gonna be more of a sort of discussion
star video like Steve would do with
unboxing boxes and we're gonna be
talking about smartphones specifically
the smartphones that I think are some of
the best value buyers out on the market
right and how everything from sort of
your your high-end stuff right at the
top like your Galaxy S nines all the way
down to I think we're gonna go down to
about a hundred dollars in this video so
we're covering a whole ton of price
points for you guys and this is actually
video that I was tossing up whether or
not I actually do considering obviously
most of the content on our channel is to
do with pcs and that sort of thing but I
asked you guys on the community tab of
our YouTube channel more than a thousand
people voted so thank you very much for
that I think at the time filming this
was about sixty nine percent of people
wanted to see this video so I thought
that that's probably enough to sort of
justify making one so we're going to go
through very casually we'll just take a
look at some smartphones and yeah I'll
give you guys my thoughts so let's get
into it
I've actually printed some gamers Nexus
style notes here for this particular one
normally use a teleprompter to fill most
of our videos but I felt that it's time
to test out super than my printer still
actually works so we'll start right at
the top end and I think for most people
you're going to be deciding whether you
want to use Android or iOS I think
there's not many people that are really
tossing up between say like an iPhone X
or a galaxy s 9 or a pixel to excel
straight up on value I still think that
you know you choose one of those
ecosystems and stick with it pretty much
for life so obviously with iOS you
choose an iPhone X that's the best
iPhone you can get on the market as far
as Apple devices go that's pretty much
the best one as far as Android devices
go um there's a lot of really good
options at the top and I think it comes
down to sort of two brackets you'd have
to say I think if you really want the
best hardware in terms of the overall
package at the moment I'd be going for
the Samsung Galaxy S 9 plus and the
snapdragon version of that specifically
and there's a couple of reasons for that
so the Galaxy S 9 plus has a really
great display its high resolution
it's got really good color quality
you've got accurate modes in there as
well for vibrant modes the snapdragon
845 that you get in snapdragon model
really good performance really good
cellular performance for things like 4G
LTE it's got a whole range of
connectivity features there that aren't
necessarily support on some other
devices gigabit LT is one of them it's
got really good battery life as well the
larger phone the s9 + in particular has
that good battery life the s9 the
smaller one not quite as much but I
quite like what the s9 + Snapdragon
model provides in that respect and as
well the really good cameras on the back
I really like their thousand fps slow
motion then it can do the true aperture
thing is neat and the color quality and
just general image quality from the
camera is really good there's a few
things that I would say though about the
s9 + that I don't like the XR nice model
I think is worth avoiding so for those
of you in Australia like me
unfortunately the XR small one that were
actually being given but I think that
moral because of a few performance
issues it's more flash generation its
performance and battery life isn't that
impressive I would steer clear of that
one this is the pixel 2 XL long time was
my daily driver I'd probably stick to
that if you're in Australia for the best
phone you can get the galaxy s 9 plus
you get X and all smaller like this one
which is not something that I would
recommend unfortunately yeah the other
concerns I have is with the software and
I don't like Samsung software all that
much it has been improving but there's
still a lot of bloat where there's still
a lot of things that I think slow down
the performance a bit compared to the
stock Android experience that you get
with something like the pixel to excel
so what I would recommend I know you
guys promote say I'm assuming you're
enthusiast for this sort of thing if you
get your s 9 plus I would definitely be
going and looking on xda-developers
getting either a stock rom and just
flashing that entirely or alternatively
using things like the pixel launcher and
just generally swapping out as much of
Samsung's garbage as you can because
yeah Samsung software option is not that
great and that's really one of the
reasons why I still like the pixel to
excel because you get to stock Android
and the camera on the pixel to excel is
also slightly better than I think you
get with the galaxy s 9 plus so next up
we have the best value Android
smartphone or best value smartphone
overall I think this one is the one that
I would personally
by over some of those top-end devices
and actually it's become my daily driver
recently this is the one plus six and
yeah there's not a lot of bad things I
can say about this phone really
considering I've been using it for quite
a while I've used a lot of these other
phones for a while as well but this one
in particular it's 520 US dollars
through the oneplus store five hundred
and thirty US dollars I think for the
64gb model admittedly you do miss out on
some of the features that some of the
top in phones would get there's no micro
SD card slot there's no waterproofing
the camera quality isn't quite the same
level as your pixels or your samsung
galaxy s nines but you still get things
like a qualcomm snapdragon 845 SOC it's
really fast and in this particular unit
considering it uses mostly a stock
Android experience I found to be really
fast natually in some of our real-world
benchmark and I've sort of been doing on
the side it was edging out some of the
other devices just a little bit which is
always nice to see from that sort of
phone it's also got a headphone jack I
know there's a lot of discussion about
whether you know dongles are still a
thing and still you know the real
downsides to having dongles but I love
having the 3.5 mm headphone jack still
in the phone because I still have
headphones that use it and the pixel two
is one of those phones it doesn't have
the headphone jack so annoyingly you
have to use the dongle the s9 plus has
one but I just think it's one of those
features that really adds to the value
even even though it's just a really sort
of small feature I guess you'd have to
say other things I guess it is splash
proof the device again no micro SD card
slot uses oxygen OS which is very close
to stock Android you won't get the same
level of I guess updates that you would
get from a pixel device but because it's
stock Android I think there really isn't
a lot of things you need to adjust out
of the box to make that a really nice
usage usage experience and there's not a
lot of blood we're on there either there
so as far as the software is concerned
it's great and they display 1080p class
large display I think it's six point
three inches or there abouts
and it has got at the knotch I was
really big notch hater before getting
into using this device but honestly
after using this for like a month or so
now don't notice the knotch so changed
my opinion on that one but I really
liked what this smartphone provides for
the 530 dollars you would get it through
Amazon unfortunately for those of you in
Australia
not available in Australia you'll have
to either import it or yeah
I don't really know I think one place
used to sell the 1+5 in Australia but
they're just they've got a bit off that
bandwagon with the one plus six
unfortunately so so next to use the
mid-priced phone sort of looking in your
200 to 400 US dollar price range and
there's a lot of phones in this market a
lot of phones and one thing that I
really don't like people recommending I
see this a lot and a lot of articles out
there is there's so many mid-range
options that just don't give you good
value for money they're just they skimp
on things in the hardware then don't
give you features that other smartphones
available in that price to give you
things like your mid tiers from Sony
from Samsung LG HTC all of those
companies I think have pretty
unimpressive mid-range options but there
are a couple of standouts the first
category that I always like recommending
is flagship phones from the last
generation so often if you go back and
look on Amazon for things like LG's last
generation phones Samsung's last
generation phones they might be starting
to fall into that $400 sub $400 price
category and I think those phones
provide really good value the pixel one
at the moment so that's the first
generation pixel the one before this one
that I've got over here that's currently
retailing for 320 US dollars on Amazon
it's a really good buy it's got the
Snapdragon 820 one in there which is
much faster than your Snapdragon 600
series SOC s like you typically see in
mid-range devices the camera it's pretty
much unparalleled in that price range
it's still a really good stock Android
you could get Google's you know official
software updates cuz it's still
supported there that's your life is
quite good from this smaller pixel which
is the one that's three hundred and
twenty dollars so I think all around for
320 bucks that combination of hardware
it just blows out of the water to be on
some of those other smartphones you know
things that only give you the Snapdragon
600 is the crappy 13 megapixel rear
cameras all that sort of thing it's just
way better value for money in my opinion
for $250 I would recommend at the moment
the Motorola MOTO G 6 I believe the new
one the g6 I've recommended the Moto G
phones for a long time and I know this
sort of riles up people who are sort of
more in the shower
and cheap Android device side of things
but I really think that for a lot of
people who just want a phone that works
well out of the box you can't go past
the nice stock Android experience that
Motorola provides on the Moto G phones
it really is so much better than the
crap you get with xiaomi phones and
especially when you import a lot of
xiaomi phones you have to you install
the Google Play Store through dodgy
means they'll come with Chinese
installed out of the box sometimes you
have to install English I've actually
had to do that on Xiaomi devices in the
past I really like what Xiaomi provides
from a hardware perspective I think they
do quite well there but considering the
Moto G 6 is only 250 bucks and you're
getting a snapdragon 450 which is
reasonably powerful in that sort of
price range 32 gig of storage is
standard micro SD card slot headphone
jack it's got a 5.7 inch 1080p cars 89
display so it's hitting those modern
trends there with the display I quite
like the display on it Bachelor is
really good because you're getting that
Snapdragon 400 series SOC but the
crucial thing really is that software
it's going to be updated to the new
version of Android that's coming out
shortly no guarantees with Xiaomi
devices whatsoever there and I just way
prefer using stock Android so probably
going to get a ton of comments saying
that the Xiaomi devices are better from
their hardware and I would agree in some
cases that's true you would get better
hardware but for someone who just wants
to pick up a phone and use it straight
out of the box
I think the Moto G 6 provides a much
better experience and much less
frustrating experience and the cameras
not too bad either for those who want to
spend a little bit less money the Moto G
6 play is $200 through Amazon also a
good option you sacrifice a bit of
performance and a few other hardware
features but you do save a good amount
of money there so that's two options and
for those of you in Australia who aren't
available to access these phones through
Amazon unfortunately where things like
the pixel 1 and the G 6 aren't as good
value for money I would still recommend
the g 6 I think it's a really good
option here in Australia as well it's
actually really competitively priced use
so that's quite a good option and the
final category that below $100 phone now
there's a few caveats I want to talk
about with hundred-dollar phones and one
of them is really you should avoid
buying them I think once you start
getting to 200 bucks 250 bucks like with
you G sixes and your j6 plays you really
get good
value-for-money there you get decent
hardware decent displays decent cameras
and you can use one of those phones and
live and have a good life not to be
frustrated I think a hundred dollars is
really you know you really are strapped
for cash and you're trying to save as
much money as possible so I would still
stick to your $200 phones if you can I
know some people can't so the phone I
recommend for $100 is the xiaomi redmi v
a and i know i was just talking about
xiaomi phones having less than ideal
software let's say but i think once you
get into that hundred or you know
category you really want all-out just
the best hardware you'll sort out the
software later and to be honest there's
really not that many options at the
moment in that price category that give
you sort of like a good software
experience plus good hardware not a lot
of competition i would have to say so
for $100 what do you get five inch 720p
display pretty basic but importantly you
get a qualcomm snapdragon 425 so that's
one of the fastest SOC you can get in
this product sort of space in terms of
pricing often we see with these sort of
phones you get Qualcomm Snapdragon 200
series SSAS which is super slow and like
pretty much unusable media tech
associates which I don't really like for
a range of reasons they have weaker
modems they tend to not be that
impressive with their performance I
still think there's a few issues with
their sort of Governors and that sort of
thing that Qualcomm is tied up a bit
better with the Snapdragon 400 series so
really like the inclusion in the
Snapdragon 425 there and we really I
really hate recommending you know super
slow phones to people so I would avoid
anything with like lower than that
performance dual SIM as well three
thousand milliamp hour battery there's
really a lot of things to like about
that phone considering you can import
one for literally a hundred US dollars
and again in Australia through these
importing websites you can get very good
currency conversion so I'd still
recommend it I think it's like 150
Australian dollars or there abouts
imported that's a really good deal so
I'll look into that one and another
phone that I will also be keeping my eye
out on this one hasn't been released yet
but is the nokia 2.1 so that's an
android one phone which means you gain
more of a stock Android experience than
the redmi 5 a but it does also include
like the snapdragon 425 I believe some
of the features aren't quite as good I
think it's only got 1 gig of ram an
8-year storage where's the red me five
is a bit better in those two departments
very similar display as well but that
should be coming in just probably
slightly more than a hundred dollars
that the read me five a is that so
that's another one I'd be keeping my eye
out for in I think it's supposed to be
released this month so keep an eye out
for that one phones that I have also
used that I sort of wasn't as keen on LG
g7 yeah I don't think it's as good value
is something like the one plus six I'd
probably pick up this one over the g7
and you know a lot of the hardware
features are very similar same with the
HTC u12 plus they had the button issue
which really frustrated me and again HTC
has good camera support good camera
software all that sort of thing runs
good software but again I just think the
value you eat with a sort of phone like
the HTC u 12 plus eight I think you
should either go higher end and get the
best sort of hardware you can get for
the price of which would be like your
Galaxy S nine plus or you sort of save
money and get a one plus six or even a
lower tier device you know things like
the pixel one that I was talking about
that you can get on a really good
special at the moment and potentially
the new shall be flagship as well I
really like the me six when that was you
know released last year I thought that
provide a really good value for money in
terms of its hardware so I think as well
looking for those Xiaomi flagship
devices can be quite beneficial as well
so this has been an interesting video
I'm sure for you guys bit more of that
sort of discussion style using the paper
notes which let's be honest I'm gonna
continue using a teleprompter because I
prefer that way but yeah I hope you guys
sort of learnt something about what we
recommend here that you guys use at
hardware and box I'm gonna continue
using the oneplus 6 in case you guys
were wondering Steve I believe uses a
Galaxy S 8 plus at the moment so if you
want to know what we use that's what we
use and that's sort of what we recommend
links to other things we're talking
about will be in the description below
through Amazon if you're in the u.s. and
most of these recommendations also carry
over to Australia so you know if you buy
into a website like Cogan which I think
tends to do pretty good phone deals a
lot of things that we're talking about
here can also be found through there and
I would recommend so that's it for this
one like this video if you liked it
we're not going to be doing on a smart
phone content regularly or regularly at
all really so don't worry we're going to
be getting back to do
PC stuff very very shortly and we might
update this sort of video doing sort of
a roundup of smartphones maybe twice a
year or something like that so don't
worry I'll be getting back to doing some
display testing and other things right
after making this video if you have any
questions about smartphones we're more
than happy to discuss with you in either
the comments on this video or check out
our exclusive discord chat available for
our patreon supporters this one this
video it feels like it's been going on
for a very long time so I'm just going
to end it I'll catch you in the next one
