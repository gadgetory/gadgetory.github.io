we're finally looking at another rising
mobile laptop the second ever system
I've had proper hands-on time with some
reason it's been extraordinarily
difficult to get more rising power of
laptops in my hands it's not that they
don't exist because at this point there
are a range of options on the market
it's just companies haven't had them
available here all wouldn't send them
out for review anyway
HP has pulled through with their
brand-new HP Envy x-360 13 inch and this
spoiler alert is a fantastic system the
level of performance you get in this
form factor and at a sub $700 price
point is hard to pass up and that's
without mentioning numerous other
features HP has managed to cram into
this machine
the envy x-360 13 also provides us with
the platform to see how rise in mobile
fares in a 13-inch form factor for the
first time when I initially reviewed
rise in mobile than the 15-inch Envy
x-360 was actually back over there it
was good but I thought the real strength
of this apu would be in ultra compact
notebooks pitted directly against intel
cable ike refresh systems without
discrete graphics after all we know how
disappointing intel's integrated
graphics is so to get an APU with a more
powerful GPU in the same form factor is
a very attractive proposition and I'll
talk a bit more about the performance
later on if you weren't aware of the
price tag it would be easy to mistake
the envy x-360 13 for a high-end system
the pressed aluminium shell with an
anodized grey finish looks incredible
for a mid-range device with elements
like the pattern spine and deep black
glass bezels adding to the premium
finish the newer HP logo on the lid
combined with expansive slabs of metal
and relatively few seen or changes in
materials delivers a minimalist design
that I love the 13-inch Envy x-360 is
also super compact there's pretty slim
bezels around the 13.3 inch 1080p
display not the slimmest I've seen but
it's hard to complain about the wedge
design is reasonably thin at 15
millimeters and despite having that 360
degree hinge the whole unit weighs just
1.27 kilograms which is slightly under
the average I'd expect for a laptop this
size just on the 360 degree hinge
again it's not a feature I personally
use a lot though some people may find
the tablet and stand modes useful in
some situations the one thing I love
about these convertible designs though
is that having these extra modes does
not compromise the laptop experience in
any way you still get a great keyboard
and trackpad with the ability to use it
on your lap with ease the more tablet
focused devices like the surface aren't
nearly as good in that regard
HP includes a pen in the box which
supports Windows 10 - native inking
functionality and packs 1024 levels of
pressure sensitivity though HP tells me
a pen with four times the sensitivity is
available as an optional extra for those
that require it the pen works really
well and it's great you get it in the
box for those that want to annotate or
draw no need to spend a hundred bucks on
an accessory just to get that
functionality
I always decent you get two full size
USB 3.1 gen2 us a USB C 3.1 gen2 port no
Thunderbolt 3 here but you can charge
the laptop through USB C if you have a
charger that supports the appropriate
amount of power output otherwise the
Envy x-360 also charges over a
proprietary connector and that's the
charge included in the box there's also
a 3.5 ml headphone jack and micro SD
card slot the sides also include the
power button volume buttons and a
sizable fan vent so there wasn't a whole
lot of extra space for further IO but
what has been included is sufficient
especially as you can turn the USB C
port into a variety of display outputs
through a dongle this laptop is simply
too thin for something like full-sized
HDMI the keyboard is as good as ever
borrowing the exact same design as other
envy and Specter devices the clicky
tactile response is one of my favorites
among ultra-thin laptops each key is
extremely stable and the layered is
decent so you can awesome typing
experience the Trackman isn't so good
it's fine but it could do with a bit
more vertical height and it doesn't have
quite the same responsiveness or
accuracy as the best trackpad as I've
used a large section above the keyboard
is used for the speaker array with Bang
&amp;amp; Olufsen branding and the sound quality
they produce is actually pretty decent
for a laptop it's nothing amazing they
lack low-end punch like most laptop
speakers but at least they can go pretty
loud without epic Distortion
and I wouldn't describe them as super
tinny either the display at least Amara
unit is a 13.3 inch 1080p IPS LCD with
performance that fits this laptops
mid-range price brightness is average
topping out at just 215 it's as is the
contrast ratio which falls the touch
below a thousand to one viewing angles
though are outstanding as you might
expect for a convertible laptop and
there's a touchscreen included that
works well in terms of color performance
we looking at 89% coverage of the srgb
gama which is a little below what i'd
normally like to see but significantly
better than the 15-inch envy x-360 that
supported only 67 percent coverage
looking across the accuracy charts it's
all very average again with deltas in
the 4.0 to 6.0 range the display looks
fine from an initial glance but it's not
something you'd want to use for any
serious color work at least without full
calibration let's talk about performance
and once again I'll be mostly going
through how the HP Envy x-360 13
performs in a summarized way because
I've already covered the Rison 5 2500
you in detail a fair while ago and those
results are still perfectly valid and
yes the envy x-360 13 unit I was sent
packs the Rison 5 2500 you also
available is the rise in 7 2700 you if
you want slightly high CPU clocks and a
decent amount more GPU performance while
on the low end you can get the Rison 3
2300 you although I'd recommend sticking
with at least the Rison 5 to get a
decent GPU there's also 8 gigabytes of
ddr4 as standard and a 256 gig SSD
although those parts are upgradable if
you like strangely HP only offers a 16
gig ram upgrade with the risin 5 SKU not
rising 7 and a 4k screen is also an
optional extra though I'd stick to 1080p
for performance and battery life reasons
the main difference between the rise and
5 2500 you in the 13-inch Envy x-360 and
the one used in the 15-inch Envy x-360 I
use for my original rise in 5 2500 you
testing is the power configuration the
15-inch model with more room for cooling
uses a 25 watt config rose the 13-inch
I'm reviewing today uses the standard 15
watt config while the chip and its specs
is identical this TDP difference governs
how power is split between the CPU and
the GPU as well as what levels of Bruce
clocks can be sustained and for how long
so naturally there's going to be a
performer
difference when going from 25 watts down
to 15 watts the good news is that when
you compare the two configurations the
performance difference is only
significant in a few types of workloads
in shorter mostly CPU bound tasks like
Cinebench Excel 7-zip and PC mark there
is very little performance difference
either within the margin of error or
reduced by a single-digit amount
considering we're talking about a 40%
reduction in TDP and most everyday tasks
of these shorter CPU bound type things
that's a great result for the 15 watt
configuration of risin 5 mobile where
the 2500 u does take a hit is in longer
workloads specifically things like video
encoding handbrake for example is 27%
slow in a test attacks over 2 hours to
complete blender is another benchmark
that sees around that 27 to 28 percent
hit which again isn't quite as large as
the 40 percent cut to power the other
area that gets impacted is GPU
performance and it's there you'll see
reductions by around 30 to 35 percent
even in shorter loads it's no real
surprise of the higher 25 watt
configuration is able to allocate more
power to the GPU so when you bring that
down to 15 watts it's an area that is
going to suffer a bit discussing the 15
watt versus 25 all configurations is
just for interest sake really is the
main comparison is between the Rison 5
2500 you and the Intel Core i5
8250 you the latter of which is found in
competing systems around this price and
here Rison is quite competitive
depending on the workload particularly
in tasks that utilize the GPU in
Cinebench r15 the Rison 5 2500 do takes
a strong 21% lead and there were also
handy wins in 7-zip decompression and
our premier
non luma tree test blender was also a
good 15 percent faster on the 2500 u
thanks to rise in Mobile's far more
impressive integrated graphics several
other tests pulled up around the same
level as the 8250 you including excel
x264 encoding second pass the more
intensive of the two passes and PC mark
the two major losses shouldn't come as a
surprise handbrake uses AVX instructions
for encoding x265 videos and Rison is
well-known to have weaker AVX
performance compared to equivalent intel
parts hence white falls 28% behind
MATLAB a commonly used tool for
engineers
is an optimized horizon at all and in
fact uses Intel optimized binaries which
sees rise and suffer significantly in
that test in GPU bound snow is like 3d
MUX time spy test the risin 5 2500 you
holds an enormous lead on the Core i5
8250 you to the tune of more than 50%
and this carries across into the GPU
bound games and compute heavy
applications all those sort of things
there is no doubt whatsoever that the
risin 5 2500 you is far superior to
their Core i5 a 250 you in graphics and
in some cases like fortnight it's
actually possible to play the game
comfortably on the 2500 you where the AE
250 you is really not fast enough and
that's really the tale of the two CPU
options the risin 5 2500 you offers
equivalent CPU performance to the core
i5 8250 you in most applications except
the 2500 you offers significantly better
graphics performance if you want to do
anything GPU related including playing
basic level games and you're tossing it
between say the envy x-360 with rice and
mobile and something with Intel Inside
rise and mobile is a much better option
both a and B and Intel have higher tier
CPUs on offering a 15 watt TDP
configuration on the Intel site there's
the cry 78550 you and on the AMD side we
have the rise in seven 2700 you so it
doesn't seem fair to compare the risin 5
2500 you in my review unit to say the
core i7
8550 you but if you do want more
performance there is an Envy x-360 13
with the horizon 7 2700 you inside so
you'll be able to enjoy the fastest CPU
and GPU that apu provides and again the
2700 you is extremely competitive with
the 85 50 you there is one other laptop
configuration i want to mention and
that's the core i7 85 50 you paired up
with nvidia geforce MX 151 de 12 a combo
we've started to see in 13 inch
notebooks recently to provide a decent
GPU in intel power systems to replace
their mediocre integrated GPU the MX 151
d 12 is a fair bit faster than the GPU
in the rise and 5 2500 you but the 2700
you certainly gives it a run for its
money
also the MX 150 + 85 50 you combo
requires more power than rising mobile
so that's something to keep in mind for
those that run workloads on a battery I
done extensive testing with the Rison
seven 2700 you or the MX 151 de 12 but
what I will say is don't automatically
assume the discrete MX 150 is superior
to the risin seven 2700 use integrated
Vega GPU simply because it's a discrete
GPU rise and mobile is highly
competitive with the MX 150 and that's
why I think it's such a compelling
option for ultra portable systems moving
on from discussing rising mobile spend a
lot of time on it let's look at storage
performance inside the HP Envy x-360 is
a samsung PM 961 PCIe nvme SSD and it
provides really solid performance across
sequential and random transfer tests
it's not as fast as the very latest
Samsung SSDs but it's - performs very
well certainly outperforming SATA SSDs
you often see mid tier products inside
the envy x-360 is a 53 watt hour battery
which is a typical size for a 13-inch
ultra portable and it delivers ok
battery life you aren't going to get
blown away by what the system offers
systems with you know larger batteries
like the LG gramm and the dell XPS 13
still outperform the envy x-360 in our
tests but for a laptop with a more
powerful APU and a touchscreen I'm
pretty happy with the battery results
all up the envy x-360 13 is a highly
impressive device particularly when you
factor in that price I'm actually a
little amazed that for just 700 u.s.
dollars you can get this great metal
chassis with a 360 degree hinge an
acceptable 1080p touch display with the
pen in the box and most importantly the
power of the Rison 5 2500 you
complimented by a gig of ram and a 256
gig SSD this device could genuinely be a
flagship product yet HP is perfectly
content to sell it in the mid-range with
a very attractive price those are the
performance junkies and particularly
will love this devices the Rison 5 2500
u provides CPU performance around the
mark of the Cry 5 a 250 u in most
benchmarks yet it absolutely smashes the
Intel offering and GPU performance with
the much faster integrated Vega GPU that
makes it a great system flows that want
to smash out some documents or photo
editing and then play a bit of Fortnite
on the side this isn't to say the device
is perfect because no laptop is perfect
battery life could be a bit better
though it's fine for most users the fan
does get quite loud under load and there
do a few oddities with Rison mobile like
the lack of driver updates and the odd
app that is incompatible or as you saw
earlier just performs unusually poorly
but I think when you can get what the
envy x-360 13-inch provides a $700
you'll be hard-pressed to find a more
attractive system on the market and
easily recommend this for students or
really anyone that wants a bang for your
buck ultra portable it's a far better
system than the 15-inch Envy x-360 I
looked at earlier in the year - which
came as a pleasant surprise for the
Aussies out there again HP is stinging
us massively with the price for the envy
x-360 13 the model currently being sold
for $700 u.s. will set us back 1800
Aussie dollars which is absolutely
outrageous most consumer electronics
here do have some sort of Australia tech
I'm sure you all know about that but I
would love to hear HP's justification
for why the unit has more than $700
worth attacks on top of the u.s. price
plus GST when converted this laptop
would be in a lead option at 1200 bucks
here but $1,800 that's just unfair on
Aussies but that's it of this review of
the HP Envy x-360 13-inch if you're

laptops and you're in the US where the
