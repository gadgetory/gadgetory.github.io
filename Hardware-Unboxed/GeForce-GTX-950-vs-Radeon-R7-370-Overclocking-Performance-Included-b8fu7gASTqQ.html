released their sub $200 graphics cards
the Radeon r7 370 in the geforce gtx 950
both targeted the 150 to 160 dollar
price range and at that price were able
to deliver affordable 1080p gaming
performance to the masses if you were to
compare these two graphics cards on
paper that Radeon r7 370 wins hands down
the 370 has 33% more cores and twice the
memory bus for a 70% more bandwidth the
370 texture fill raid and single
precision processing power of the 370 is
almost 30% greater as well so it seems
like an open-and-shut case then that is
until you realize that the r7 370 is
built upon the ageing GC and 1.0
architecture while the gtx 950 s heart
is in video's latest Maxwell
architecture when we reviewed the 950
back in August it was found to be mostly
faster than the r7 370 so that just goes
to show how you can't compare one
architecture to another on paper however
since then mg is done what it does best
slash prices and well we love them for
that some r7 370 graphics cards have
been reduced from the initial MSRP of
150 dollars down to 135 dollars while
certain models can be had for as little
as 110 dollars after rebates on
newegg.com
here in australia the cheapest 370 cost
bang-on $200 yep we get rolled the gtx
950 debuted of 160 dollars and that's
exactly how much it costs over at
newegg.com today though certain models
such as the MSI gaming 2g and the ACE 2
Strix cost 170 dollars down under the
gtx 950 cost around 230 dollars so to
recap the gtx 950 cost 19% more than the
r7 370 in the US and 15 percent more in
australia the testing will be including
a to the very latest triple-a titles
along with the tried-and-true
battlefield 4 also along for the ride is
Tom Clancy's Rainbow six siege which is
you take seriously enough you're free to
and visiting friends rather than not
will also be testing with Just Cause 3
and explosive
game looks so bad on console to make
your eyes bleed we've got The Witcher 3
Wild Hunt the game with hair so real you
GPU kind of in handle it call of duty
black ops 5 no wait 6 whatever they're
up to now we've got Batman Arkham Knight
where finally I can drive the Batmobile
around without dipping down to 5 FPS
using a Titan X Mad Max a game I enjoyed
a lot more than the 2015 movies all out
for an open-world action role-playing
game that can apparently be completed
without having to commit
post-apocalyptic murder
and finally Star Wars Battlefront the
blockbuster title which turned out to be
shallower than a kiddie pool
testing takes place exclusively at 1080p
using a core i5 6600 K processor with
the latest graphics card and system
drivers under Windows 10 the games were
tested using watered-down quality
settings an effort to achieve a 60 FPS
average and the settings will be labeled
on the graphs the Radeon r7 370 and
geforce gtx 950 were tested at the
default AMD and NVIDIA clock
specifications as well as a maximum
overclock the maximum overclock was
legitimately as far as we could push
each card and we feel the results are
pretty much the norm the GTX 950 was
overclocked to a core speed of 12 60
megahertz placing the boost frequency at
around 1400 and 80 megahertz with a
memory speed of 8 gigahertz the r7 370
reached a core clock speed 1120
megahertz to keep in mind it doesn't
support any kind of boost technology the
370 memory wound up to 6 point 4
gigahertz for almost all the games fraps
was used to measure framerate
performance and we recorded 90 seconds
of gameplay in each game the only game
where we didn't use fraps was Rainbow
six siege as the inbuilt benchmark works
nicely the gtx 950 enjoyed a
considerable performance advantage over
the r7 370 in battlefield 4 using the
ultra quality settings a 1080p with MS a
a disabled the 370 fell just short of 60
FPS while the 950 exceeded the 60 FPS
barrier with 64 FPS maked 19% faster
once overclocked the 370 did reach 62
FPS though it was still 18% slower than
the overclocked
50 which delivered a very smooth 73 FPS
the Batman Arkham Knight performance was
far more competitive and although the
game was tested with game when speech is
disabled we were still impressed with a
50 FPS average from the r7 370 and a
slightly faster 52 FPS from the gtx 950
overclocked the 950 average 59 FPS
making it just 5% faster than the
overclocked 370 and 13% faster than its
standard configuration fall of duty
black ops 3 played significantly better
on the gtx 950 as it averaged 51 SS
whereas the r7 370 was 18% slower with
just 42 FPS even overclock the 370
couldn't match the stock 950 with an
average of 48 fps
once we have a clock the 950 it was able
to reach an average of 60 FPS making it
25% faster than the overclocked 370 here
again we find the gtx 950 as much faster
than the r7 370 this time we're playing
fallout 4 at 1080p using the medium
quality settings along with FXAA the 950
was on average 17 percent faster with a
smooth 62 FPS average frame rate once
overclocked
the 370 was able to match the stock 950
having received a 15% performance boost
however overclocking the 950 also
yielded a 15% performance boost making
it 16 percent faster than the
overclocked 370 even with the medium
quality settings at 1080p we find that
the r7 370 struggles with Just Cause 3
averaging just 4u
yes the GTX 950 was 23% faster with 49
FPS on average there we are ideally
looking for a 60 FPS average
overclocking the 370 boosted performance
by 15 percent to 46 FPS which
still meant it was slower than the stock
9/15 on the other hand overclocking the
950 increase the average frame rate by
16% and we were now receiving a much
more agreeable 57 fps the only game we
were able to test with all the visual
quality settings maxed out was Mad Max
here the r7 370 average 49 FPS which was
boosted 256 FPS once overclocked the gtx
950 on the other hand started a 57 FPS
and once overclocked provided 16% more
performance at 66 FPS the Radeon r7 370
was good for 53 FPS at 1080p using the
very high quality settings remember
succeed that said we needed to overclock
the 370 in order to match the stock
performance to the GTX 950 at 60fps
overclocking the gtx 950 netted another
20% performance allowing the average
frame rate to hit 72 FPS star wars
battlefront were to treat on AMD
hardware and as a result for the first
time we see the r7 370 beating the gtx
950 obeah by just three FPS I mean 6
percent margin that said with both cards
overclocked to their maximum stable
frequency they provided the same 65 fps
finally we have the Witcher 3 Wild Hunt
and here the r7 370 was good for just 42
fps and 49 fps once overclocked which
was just shy of the GTX 950 standard
performance of 50 fps overclocking the
950 allowed for an 18% boost in
performance as we hit a much smoother 59
fps power consumption is about what we
expected when comparing GC and 1.0 to
the more modern Maxwell architecture
despite being considerably faster and
almost all of the tests the GTX 950
consumed 10% less power in fallout 4
with both graphics cards overclocked
that margin change to 12% in favor of
the 950 the r7 370 and gtx 950 delivered
similar performance in star wars
battlefront
that we find that the 370 consumed 18%
more power and 22% more once overclocked
of these two budget graphics cards the
geforce gtx 950 s hands down the fastest
we need almost all of our tests by a 10
to 15 percent margin making it on
average 12% faster
the only games where performance was
comparable with Batman Arkham Knight and
Star Wars Battlefront games where the
GTX 950 had a distinct advantage that
allowed it to reach a 60 FPS average
once overclocked include a call of duty
black ops 3 Just Cause 3 and The Witcher
3 in these games the 950 really did
appear to be the vastly superior
solution that would likely allow for
even greater image quality settings to
be used the 950 also consumes slightly
less power as well which is nice but
certainly not enough to hand at the whim
when it came time to overclock we're
able to push the core clock speed of the
gtx 950 23% higher while the r7 370 had
just 15% headroom
this gave the 950 a slight advantage
when taking over clocking into account
and it was now an average 16% faster all
of these stats really appear to be
adding up an invidious favour and well
depending on how you look at it they are
however let's take a look at the cost
per frame data here you see that bang
for your buck
the overclocked r7 370 delivers the best
value and it costs to just two dollars
41 per frame though granted that is just
2 percent less than the overclocked gtx
950 also worth noting is that the 370 is
5% cheaper per frame before any
overclocking takes place this then is a
lot like our GTX 970 versus r9 390
comparison which to the dismay of many
we went with the better overclocking
more fuel efficient 970 the conclusion
here is going to be much the same Oh be
it for a slightly different situation if
you can afford to spend the extra 25 to
30 dollars on the gtx 950 and we suggest
you do is you get a graphics card
capable of reaching or exceeding your 60
FPS average once overclocked that's with
a rather impressive image quality
setting is the latest triple-a titles
even before any overclocking takes place
the gtx 950 was good for 55 FPS on
average
well the 370 dip just below 50 FPS with
the 49 FPS average obviously 160 dollars
just out of your price range there's no
better option than the r7 370
moreover if you can get one of those
rebate cards from newegg.com for 110
dollars and that seems like the best
option here in Australia the 950
just 10% more and giving it's at least
12% faster it's clearly the better
option down under although this doesn't
really change the finding is that is
interesting to note that the r7 370 is
essentially a three year old graphics
card as it's a really bad Radeon HD 7850
with a much lower core clock speed
back then the 7850 cost is 250 dollars
so it doesn't feel like much progress
has been made in recent times when you
look at it that way
overall both cards deliver a similar
cost per frame so there's really no
wrong choice in my opinion thanks for
watching another Hardware emboss
