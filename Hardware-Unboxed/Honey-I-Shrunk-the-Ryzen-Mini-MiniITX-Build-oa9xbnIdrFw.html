building a very small PC inside the very
small in win Chopin computer case now I
unboxed this impressive little case on
an unboxing box's episode about a month
ago now so I thought it was about time I
got around to putting this little
computer together over the past five
weeks I've put together a large amount
of Raven Ridge content and we've
benchmarked these new ApS from just
about every single angle possible the
only thing I haven't done is put one
inside an ultra compact Mini ITX case so
let's correct that be warned though the
build that I have planned isn't the most
cost-effective and it's certainly not
the way to go about things if you wanted
to build a cheap budget PC but later in
the video I will recommend parts for a
budget version of this build this is
more what you'd build if you're after
sort of the ultimate compact home
theater PC you know something that can
handle all your multimedia requirements
were also capable of pushing over 60fps
and title such as overwatch at 1080p for
this we're going with the risin 2400 G
16 gigabytes of ddr4 2666 memory from a
data the gigabyte a be 350 n Gaming
Wi-Fi Mini ITX motherboard a dot is s10
nvm a 256 gigabyte SSD and that'll be
used as the boot drive and then we'll
have crucial M X 500 one terabyte SSD
for secondary storage and I know this
isn't the most economical storage
configuration but it's all I had on hand
and it will work well in this build then
cooling the Rison 520 400 G will be the
acquiring c7 compact CPU cooler and this
of course will be going in the in wind
Chopin Mini ITX case which also includes
a 150 watt power supply so let's quickly
throw all this together and then I'll
play a few games on and show you how
well it runs
all right so we are pretty much done
with this build of the SSD in the back
that's all secured connected up should
be working perfectly fine you will
notice that there is a very little room
to install this cooler so there the mesh
protrudes a little bit but I don't know
if it'll be enough let's find out okay
I'd say one millimeter with the panel on
properly maybe even a half a millimeter
that wasn't quite as quick and easy to
put together as I had anticipated still
there are no major dramas squeezing in
the motherboard and then connecting up
some of the cables that was probably the
trickier things that I encountered
during the build but it's probably not
overly surprising that squeezing some of
this stuff in is a bit difficult given
the size of the case now that it's built
it looks a very similar to what we've
started with and well that's because
there's no glass side panels or anything
like that that would very heavily
restrict air flow in such a small case
so we just have the mesh side panel you
can of course see the white fan on the
c7 but apart from that it all looks
pretty similar to what we started with
that said though the Chopin is just a
fantastic looking case as it is and I
really like this silver version I think
it looks a bit special it is worth
noting though that US shoppers are
getting stung quite heavily for this
model would cost about 130 dollars u.s.
to purchase this thing from eBay and you
would be buying it from Australian
retailer for whatever reason in when
aren't selling this case in the US or at
least I can't find it available in the
US so if you guys do know of somewhere
in the u.s. that's selling this case
then let me know I'll put the link in
the video description for people who are
keen on getting one short of finding
someone selling this case in the US
unless you're really really desperate
and you really want this case it's
probably not worth spending a hundred
and thirty dollars u.s. to get one from
an Australian retailer
there certainly are other alternatives
that can be purchased locally in the US
the cryo reg c7 fits with about a
millimeter worth of
clearance in this case so depending on
how thick your motherboard is and stuff
like that it might actually touch it's
like a millimeter maybe even half a
millimeter if we touch the mesh panel
very softly it does rub on the fans
there's very little clearance there but
anyway we should probably move on to see
how the c7 works in the Chopin case and
to do that I will be showing you some
gameplay footage and f1 2017 and then
running a long blender workload
to the car in front is ten seconds
you
overall I have to say I was a bit
disappointed with the final product
I wasn't expecting any miracles from the
cryo reg c7 but I was actually expecting
the results to be better than the Box
cooler
I believe the Wraith self comes with a
65 watt TDP and think that's for the
cool or anyway I'm not 100% sure on that
I'm sure someone can correct me in the
comments if I'm wrong but the c7 that is
rated for a hundred watts whatever the
situation there though based on my own
testing the c7 doesn't actually appear
to be any better than the Wraith stealth
the temperatures were much the same and
this meant that the risin 5 2400 G
really had no room for any kind of
overclocking in this case you could push
the GP up a little bit but it ran very
hot even when gaming with everything
left stop the system hit 57 degrees when
gaming and that's actually pretty good
that said though under serious CPU load
in our blender stress test it did hit 78
degrees which is I think we got 76 with
the Wraith stealth we weren't in a case
though so I'd say they're very similar
so again this is acceptable but yeah
it's not really any better than the Box
cooler the c7 also seems quite a bit
louder than the AMD Box cooler so that's
something I'll have to do in a
side-by-side test in the near future but
based on initial impressions it doesn't
really seem like the c7 is worth the
investment I was quite happy with the
rest of the system though that was
pretty awesome seeing this compact
little PC delivering playable
performance and a number of popular
tiles at 1080p using respectable quality
settings not that long ago I did check
out the Azeroth desk mini gtx 1068 850
dollars for the bare-bones version it
was very costly all up at would cost you
at least $1,500 us to outfit the desk
Mini and while very impressive for its
size I feel the Chopin build is really
just as useful as a home theater PC
slash gaming console replacement thing
it's also much cheaper that said for
these Raven Ridge AP used to really make
sense you'll want to spend
far less the risin 3:22 energy really is
the best value choice and as rocks
fatality a be 350 gaming ITX motherboard
will also save you about another ten
dollars personally I feel it's a better
board so he might as well get that one
instead in the bargain bin you'll also
find the in win BP six five five which
comes with a two hundred watt power
supply for just $60 u.s. you can also
save a heap of money by getting eight
gigabytes of memory but be aware with
just two DIMM slots you will need to get
rid of it if you ever want to expand
capacity in the future then they aimed a
wraith stealth box cooler seems like the
way to go on these compact mini ITX
builds and then for storage your options
well they're almost limitless really I
personally really like the crucial MX
500 525 gigabyte SSD for one hundred and
forty dollars and you can get that in
the MDOT two form factor to save even
more space for large and mechanical two
and a half inch hard drives coming away
from this build I'm actually really keen
now to do a cryo ricci 7 vs. Wraith
stealth comparison inside of the chopin
case that should be quite interesting so
keep your eye out for that
anyway that's gonna do it for this one
