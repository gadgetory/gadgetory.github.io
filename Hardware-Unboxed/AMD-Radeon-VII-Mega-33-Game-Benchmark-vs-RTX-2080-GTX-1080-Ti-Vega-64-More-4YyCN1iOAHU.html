got some good news the release driver
the public driver the first publicly
available driver for Radeon seven it
actually appears to work there's no
crashing no stability issues of any kind
it just works so that's nice I've been
able to go back to the test bench and
run a whole heap more game benchmarks
about 33 I think games in total done a
holly / resolution testing and all that
sort of stuff loads of testing some
updated games all that kind of stuff so
I've spent the last few days doing
nothing but benchmarking and then I
spent the few days before that doing
nothing but benchmarking it's been a
hectic week anyway after spending
Thursday wrapping up the coverage for
Radeon 7 the day 1 review the embargo
was lifted at 1:00 a.m. local time so
that was Friday morning so I spent all
day Thursday getting the video sorted
out before it would go alive and then I
replied to comment so I watched a few
other reviews from my favorite tech
youtubers it was a what was a late night
early morning kind of deal anyway I
ended up making it to bed around 3:00
a.m. but I didn't get that much of a
sleep because I was back up at 8 a.m.
because I wanted to hit the test systems
with ddu get rid of the press drive that
was causing me all their headaches and
then replace it with the first publicly
available a Radeon 7 driver aimed II
didn't for me prior to the release of
the public driver that there would be no
performance improvements but they did
expect it to solve my numerous stability
issues as far as I can tell radio + 7 is
now rock-solid since installing driver
version adrenaline 2019 Edition nineteen
point two point one I've not seen a
single crash so that is a massive
improvement now I did promise you guys
once the stability issues were addressed
that I would deliver a true hardware
unbox benchmark featuring far more than
a measly dozen games like I said the
past few days have been spent doing
nothing but benchmarking day and night
but we now have over 30 games to check
out including the new World of Tanks
update as well as apex legends as was
the case with the day 1 review I'll be
focusing on the 1440p data
but also provide the 1080p and 4k
results via a link in the video
description for testing our Corsair GPU
test rig built inside the crystal 570 X
has been used and it features a core I 9
9 0 K clocked at 5 gigahertz with 32
gigabytes of vengence ddr4 3400 memory
so let's check out the results for a
dozen of the games tested and then we'll
jump into the full performance breakdown
which covers all 33 games
please note since I have previously
discussed results for fortnight
battlefield 5 World of Tanks trench
Brigade Monster Hunter World shut off
the Tomb Raider Rainbow six siege Far
Cry 5 Forza horizon for Resident Evil 2
ARMA 3 and hit pan 2 in our day 1
coverage I'll skip going over them again
and instead pick a dozen different games
to discuss first up we have
apex legends and this is a fresh new
battle royale style game that came out
of pretty much nowhere I'm yet to
properly play it but it does seem like
people are enjoying this one it's based
on the same engine as titanfall 2 and
like titanfall 2 it's capped at 144 FPS
so at least that aspect of the game
kinda sucks though for most 144 FPS will
be sufficient so probably being a bit
harsh there anyway the radio and 7 does
OK
I'd say just okay in this one slightly
slower on the GTX todai-ji 12% slower
than the ITX 2080 but 26 percent faster
than Vega 64 so that's kind of Radeon 7
in a nutshell to be honest the Radeon 7
GP does perform quite well on Sniper
Elite 4 but really who didn't see that
coming this is a well optimized title
that plays well on both AMD and NVIDIA
hardware the GeForce r-tx 28 is still
slightly faster but the margin is very
small Radeon 7 also manages to improve
on Vegas 64 by a 30% margin has to be
said Deus Ex mankind divided is getting
on a bit now it's a late 2016 release
but it's certainly not the oldest game
we test with anyway for those wondering
DirectX 11 works better than DirectX 12
for both AMD and NVIDIA GPUs so that's
why we're using it the Radeon 7 was
basically able to match the GTX 1080i
making it a little slow in the r-tx 2080
but a good bit faster on the RT x 2070
and vega 64 it's not the most well
optimized title to be released last year
but it's still a lot of fun anyway
performance in Just Cause for for the
Radeon 7 was
again okay the 1% low-performance match
that of the GTX 280 on our TX 2080 which
is good but the average framerate
positioned at squarely between the ITX
2080 and 2070 which again is okay the
Star Wars Battlefront two results are
decent here the radio and seven provides
strong 1% low performance coupled with a
slightly lower than expected average
framerate in the end it was 10% slow in
the r-tx 2084 the average frame rate but
32 percent faster than Vega 64
projectiles to is always favored in
video hardware and we see that when
comparing Vega 56 and the gtx 1070 for
example typically in other games the
Vega GPU is generally faster as a result
Radeon seven was only just able to beat
the GTX 1080 making it much sold in the
r-tx 2080 and way slower than gtx 1080i
moving on we have Assassin's Creed
Odyssey and this total never really
played that nice with AMD hardware and
yeah I know it's an AMD sponsored title
but evidently that doesn't really mean
much as this game does really prefer
Intel CPUs and NVIDIA GPUs anyway the
Radeon seven was a big step forward from
Vegas 64 offering 28% more performance
sadly though this meant it was only able
to match the r-tx 2070 so overall not a
great result for the new $700 flagship
AMD GPU okay so previously I was using
the standalone World of Tanks benchmark
but since that hasn't been updated in
the game has recently received a major
overhaul I'm now switching back to
testing with the HD client the game
engine improvements were mostly focused
on better CPU utilization which is
useful for those using local optimal T
core processors we however use a 9900 K
at 5 gigahertz so less of an issue here
still it's best to test with the most
up-to-date software possible
hence the switch previously the Radeon 7
was 17% salt in the ITX 2080
now if the new version of the game it's
16% slower so same deal really
as expected nothing has really changed
here on the GPU front when not CPU
limited moving on to vermintide 2 Radeon
7 was again slower than both the RT X
2080 and gtx 980ti
though
was a huge step forward from Vegas 64
delivering 36% more frames on average
then we have The Witcher 3 and here Vega
56 is able to match the gtx 1070 yet
despite that the radio and 7 was 9%
slower than the gtx tonight ain't even
slower than the RCX 2080 there's always
that guy that calls us Nvidia biased
because we don't test with any Vulcan
titles as if there's loads of Vulcan
titles I'm like going out of our way to
avoid them anyway now the new videos
latest GPU architecture churring is up
to speed aim D no longer enjoys the
performance advantage they once did in
Vulcan based titles take Wolfenstein 2
for example here the Radeon 7 was 12%
slower than the RCX 2080 but anyway
we've included a Vulcan base title so
I'm sure that might be a problem now
dirt falls always an interesting
inclusion as CMAA enables pretty much
god mode on radeon gpus and we again see
that here with the Radeon 7 we've
previously seen AMD GPUs such as Vega 64
for example that's able to beat the 1%
low performance of the r-tx 2080 Ti and
here we see that the radio and seven
absolutely shattered are the 1% low
performance of the RDX 2082 eye while
delivering these same 154 FPS on average
fair to say ambe's GPU division would be
in pretty good shape if every game it
looked like this ok so that's how Radeon
7 stacks up in another dozen titles so
between this video and then the day one
coverage we've now closely looked at 24
games but there's another 9 we haven't
discussed and the graphs for those games
will be available for free on our
patreon page so you can find the link in
the video description that said we're
gonna see how the Radeon 7 compared to
the RT X 20 80 20 60 GTX 280 I and Vega
64 in all 33 games right now
so let's go do that in our day one
review featuring just a dozen games the
Radeon 7 was 4% slower than the RT X
2080
now with 33 games it's 7% slower so
slight change there though I did select
the previous 12 titles to include an
even amount of favorable and unfavorable
titles for the GC and 5th gen
architecture still what this graph tells
us is that there is an overwhelmingly
good chance that in a given title the RT
X 2080 will be faster make
the superior gaming GPU right now that's
just a fact as much as it may upset
certain AMD fans I'm sorry guys again
those are just the facts
moving on previously Radeon 7 was 2%
slower than the GTX 1080i with the Dozen
game sample now it's 5 percent slower
again no major changes here but for the
most part the much older GTX 1082 I was
faster moreover it was faster by a 10%
margin or greater in 10 of the 33 games
tested whereas the Radeon 7 was faster
by a 10% margin or greater in just 2 of
the 33 games tested previously we saw
that the Radeon 7 was 29% faster than
the RT X 2060 and now with a much wider
spread of games it's 28% faster so again
much of a muchness here then finally
compared to Vega 64 it was previously
found to be 23% faster and now it's 24%
faster that's my nice little performance
bump but like I said in the previous
video you are paying 40% more for a
little over 20% more performance so
there you have it we pretty much nailed
it with our initial sample of games for
the day 1 coverage the Radeon 7 is
indeed slower than the RT X 2080 while
consuming about the same amount of power
a little bit more in my test but will
vary depending on the settings used the
game used and whatever point is it's on
7 nanometers and it's definitely not
more efficient than the 2080
currently the only model available is
the reference card and it doesn't run
super hot though it may run a bit hotter
at a reasonable fan speed it spins at
about 3000 rpm it's extremely loud
unbearably loud I would put it
AMD says there is a fix incoming for the
fan profile be interesting to see what
that does to temperatures and obviously
see if it is much quieter or at least
bearable but yeah the fix is still
incoming at this point so yeah it's just
a promise for now so not going to read
too much into that we'll just have to
wait and see and then re test it when we
do get that fixed but the good news is
for now or going forward the stability
issues are soft so basically that was
just an issue with the early press
release driver sometimes they can be a
bit buggy unfortunately this one was
shaaka but the good news is as I said
anyone who managed to get one of these
will not have run into the problems we
did so yeah good stuff I'm still also
yet to delve into any overclocking and
or under vaulting but it is something
I'm really keen to check out I know a
lot of you guys have been requesting it
in the comments and yeah I will get to
that very soon
for now I really just wanted to
establish how the Radeon seven stacks up
in a massive range of games and well
yeah we've obviously done that now also
for the guys screaming immature drivers
AMD does believe that the Radeon seven
is performing as it should be but of
course as always as we've always done
and will continue to do I will benchmark
the fans off any new graphics card
though for this one might not take too
much benchmarking before their shoot off
and ricochet all around my test system
but seriously at this point you really
don't need to demand more benchmarks
from us you should just know they're
happening whether you bloody well like
it or not
as for the Radeon 7.2 much more needs to
be said at this point really if you felt
our day 1 review was too harsh well upon
reflection I don't we reviewed it
exclusively as a gaming product as we
always do with graphics cards and
frankly they're under delivered if it
happened to be more efficient than the
RT X 2080 and run really quiet I deem it
a worthy alternative but let's not
sugarcoat this or beat around the bush
it's not as efficient its layout and for
the most part it's slower only a little
slower but it is slower and if for some
reason you think we're Nvidia shells or
something crazy like that I would urge
you to go back and watch our day 1 RT X
2080
and 2070 coverage because it was not
favorable but the Radeon 7 has managed
to make the RT X 2080 look pretty good
in today's climate so for all those
reasons I can't recommend the Radeon 7
over the GeForce RT X 2080 as badly as I
wanted the 2080 to be obliterated by
this very graphics card forcing in video
to get real with their pricing that
obviously hasn't happened therefore it
seems gamers are forced to pay 2016
pricing for 2016 performance so yeah
that sucks let's just hope and pray that
things improve later in the year for now
that is going to do it I may make a
replying to comments episode as
surrounding well this video the previous
video basically my Radeon 7 content so
if you have a good question or anything
along those lines then feel free to drop
that below and I'll do my best to
include in that upcoming replying to
