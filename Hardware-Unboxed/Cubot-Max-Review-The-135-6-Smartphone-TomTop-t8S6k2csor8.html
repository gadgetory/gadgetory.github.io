phone I've ever used the cube op max
it's no secret that I've taken an
interest in Chinese phones lately now
the flagships from the major brands all
seem to just be slight refresh as year
in and year out
cubot is a brand I haven't used or seen
before and I'm enjoying exploring deeper
into the Chinese smartphone world with
the Galaxy Note Samsung kicked off a
trend towards phones with lighter
displays and the phablet was born coming
in with a 6 inch screen the cubot max is
absolutely in this category of course
with a screen this big the phone itself
is large and it both looks and feels it
in your hands the edges are curved which
helps it feel a little smaller but of
course that only goes so far the back
side of the phone has a cubic design
that gives it some texture and in turn
gives your hand a better grip and
depending on your personal preference
either makes the phone look more
interesting or ugly on the right-hand
side of the phone you'll find the volume
keys as well as the power or lock key
below them moving to the top you'll see
the micro USB port as well as the
three-and-a-half millimeter jack there's
no ports or buttons on the left-hand
side and at the bottom is six holes in
front of the mic all around it's a
fairly simple and standard layout the
front face features a front facing
camera up top notification LED and there
are three capacitive buttons at the
bottom menu home and back on the right
popping the back cover off we find two
full size SIM slots either side of the
rear camera as well as the SD card slot
on the right underneath is the big boy
battery sporty 4100 milliamp hours for
me the display was probably the weak
point of this phone not to say it was
horrible but it's such a large size I
think a minimum of 1080p is probably
necessary this phone unfortunately is
1280 by 720 and isn't protected by any
sort of Gorilla Glass so don't go
dropping it it does come with a screen
protective film though pre-installed
colors are a little dull when compared
to the display on my note 4 but that's
to be expected really on a budget phone
I wouldn't say I'm exactly a power user
that maxes out smart phone hardware and
I didn't really notice any lag or
slowdown switching between apps and
using Chrome and Facebook like a lot of
Chinese smartphones the cueball max
comes with an octa-core processor and
this one's clocked at 1.3
gigahertz there's three gigabytes of RAM
available and 32 gigabytes of internal
storage which can be expanded up to an
additional 128 gig through the SD card
slot in terms of cameras the
front-facing cameras five megapixels in
the rear is 13 megapixels not that that
really means much photos from the rear
camera are definitely serviceable but it
seemed difficult to get the right light
levels at times so probably not ideal
for quick snaps that you actually need
in decent quality in terms of software
we get the bare-bones Android 6.0
experience which is of course very
welcome so big tick here from me the
only other little thing I noticed about
the phone was the vibration felt a
little rattly but I always turn haptic
feedback and the like off anyway so that
didn't really bother me at all now let's
put all this into perspective you can
grab the cubic max from Tom top comm for
just 119 US dollars including free
standard shipping to Australia that's
pretty damn good deal for a six inch
Android 6.0 phone and with decent
hardware it's also available for one
hundred and seven US dollars on Amazon
do you guys know of any better deals on
a phablet let me know in the comments
I'm your host Matt as always I'll see
you guys next time cheers guys for
