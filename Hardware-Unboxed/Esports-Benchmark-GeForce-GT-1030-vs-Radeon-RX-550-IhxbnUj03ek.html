GPU battle though this one is a bit
different to the norm now the most
recently released GPUs from AMD and
NVIDIA so their current generation
offerings but their most recently
released models are their slowest so
from AMD we have the rx 550 and we have
their sous model here that is actually a
full gigabyte version we'll get to that
in a moment and then from the Green Team
in video we have this passively cooled
msi gt80
that s'right it doesn't have the gtx
branding because nvidia doesn't deem
this worthy of being what a gtx card
basically one of their gaming premium
gaming models it doesn't only have 384
cuda cores so it's a little light on
rendering power whereas the gtx 1050
features an MSRP of 110 dollars u.s. the
GT 1030 comes in well below $100 at just
$70 meanwhile the rx 550 is slightly
more expensive at the $80 MSRP and of
course as this is an AMD graphics card
right now getting one at the MSRP is a
next to impossible the markup that on
the rx 550 isn't nearly as bad as some
of the more higher-end models right now
you can't expect to pay about $90 u.s.
and that makes it almost 30% more than
the GT 1030 that said though is the
Radeon graphics card faster and if so by
how much well that's what we plan to
find out in today's video typically
speaking these entry-level budget cards
don't actually represent particularly
great value as these slightly more
expensive models generally deliver a
much better price to performance ratio
that though won't be the focus of this
video rather if you have less than $100
u.s. to spend on a graphics card and you
do want to buy a new graphics card and
not used which one of these two should
you buy the primary focus will be on a
sports also we're looking at games such
as csgo overwatch and dota 2 for example
also as a quick side note if you do have
a PC that is in need of an upgrade or
you just like to get an idea of what
kind of upgrades you could make to an
older PC then check out our new upgrade
my PC plea series each week I check out
5 pcs from viewers and propose
upgrade plans and then the viewers vote
for which one they think should get the
upgrade and we go on and get those parts
out to the winner anyway it's a really
cool series check it out if you're
interested for testing I've used our
rise and three test system with the 1300
X installed no ever clock has been
applied to the CPU but we are using 16
gigabytes of ddr4 3,200 memory
representing the Green Team is the MSI
gt-1000 2 GH L POC while the red team
will be represented by the Isuzu rx 554
G yes the AMD graphics card has more
vram but unfortunately this was all I
was able to get my hands on for this
test this shouldn't have a noticeable
impact on performance but be aware the 4
gigabyte model does cost more 210
dollars u.s. and at this price it
represents rather poor value the graphs
though are clearly labeled and we're not
trying to mislead anyone here we are
using a 4 gigabyte model to represent
the rx 550 so again please be aware of
that there's certainly no need to get
your knickers in a knot about this in
the comment section I'm not trying a
favor AMD if you do have a big problem
with this though feel free to buy us a 2
gigabyte model and will happily redo the
tests anyway enough of that lets get to
the benchmarks first up we have Counter
Strike global Offensive I've been told
there are a few of you guys that still
enjoy this first-person shooter so let's
check out the results those more serious
about the game do like to play with the
low quality settings and here the GT
10:13 rx 550 deliver a very similar
experience that the GT 1030 was slightly
better overall both did maintain over a
hundred FPS at all times and allowed the
average framerate to exceed 200 FPS that
being said though I am told the serious
game is like 300 plus fps in this title
but you know beggars can't be choosers
and all that for the price the
performance is very capable in this
title if you are all about that eye
candy well then the very high quality
preset still allows for over 160 FPS on
average and here the rx 550 and GT 1030
did deliver the exact same experience
overwatch is another super popular
first-person shooter and can be much
more visually demanding than csgo
even so using the low quality preset the
game was very playable using either GPU
though the GT 1030 was a whisker faster
he the one percent low result was 8%
higher using the NVIDIA GPU
that said though increasing the quality
setting to the high preset swings things
heavily in favor of the rx 550 before
anyone jumps to conclusions though and
claims that is down to the four gigabyte
vram buffer of the rx 550 card please
note at 1080p using the high quality
preset the game never allocates more
than nine hundred and forty megabytes
worth of assets at any given time in our
sixty second benchmark pass so the fact
that the rx 550 has four gigabytes of
vram is of no consequence here in the
end for those that like to turn things
up a bit higher we'll be better off with
the rx 550 and overwatch as it allowed
for 23% better performance using the
higher quality preset rocket League is
one of the most entertaining and easy to
run games out there right now
unsurprisingly because of this it is
massively popular if you turn everything
down using the high performance preset
the game spits out an average of two
hundred and forty-five frames per second
with the rx 550 and 201 fps with the GT
1030 I'm not really sure if you need
more frames than that in this title but
either way the radeon GPU was 22% faster
then when you max the game out using the
high quality preset with MLA I enabled
the rx 550 was 24% faster with an
average of 77 fps which I thought was
quite good at 1080p for representing the
multiplayer online battle arena type
games I've used dota 2 in its replay
system is excellent for accurate
benchmark results this allows me to
repeatedly target a busy part of the
game to test as a result I'm not going
to bother testing other titles such as
league of legends for example it's a
less demanding game than dota 2 so if
these cards can play dota 2 then you can
rest assured they can play league using
the lowest quality preset which is
called fastest the GT 1030 rendered 4%
more frames on average but did allow for
a 20% greater 1% low result much the
same was seen when using the
best-looking preset here the GT 1030 was
23% faster than the rx 550 for the 1%
low result despite both delivering the
same 60-ish FPS on average if you play a
lot of Tom Clancy's Rainbow six siege
and the GT 1030 looks to be the best
option here using the low quality preset
it was 9 percent faster than the rx 550
but again it's the 1% low that makes the
big difference here the GeForce GPU was
31 percent faster it's a similar story
using the high quality preset though
both the rx 5
50 and GT 1030 did deliver a similar
average frame rate the overall
experience however was much better on
the GeForce GPU as it maintained a 17%
greater one percent low result World of
Tanks was tested using the HD client
with the frame cap removed using the low
quality preset which is titled minimum
we see that both GPUs allow for almost
200 FPS on average and the experience
was much the same using either the AMD
or Nvidia hardware jumping from the
minimum quality preset to the high saw a
massive decline in framerate and this
isn't even the highest quality preset in
the game neither GPU were able to
deliver what I would call playable
performance using the maximum quality
preset anyway using the high quality
priests at the GT 1030 was 17% fast in
the rx 550 on average and a massive 35%
faster for the 1% low result those of
you keen on playing quake champions will
be best served by the GT 1030 and
despite this being an AMD sponsored
title the GeForce graphics card was
vastly superior using the low quality
preset the GT 1030 was 23% faster for
the average frame rate and 35% faster
for the 1% low things got significantly
worse with the radeon GPU and using the
higher quality preset here the GT 1030
was 60% faster on average an incredibly
93 percent faster for the 1% low you
have to think this is a driver issue for
the rx 550 in this title the battlefield
1 results were quite interesting using
the low quality preset the rx 550 was
actually 12% faster on average and 20%
faster for the 1% low result so that's a
fantastic result there for the AMD GPU
however once we increase the visual
quality with the hype reset both GPUs
are capped at 28 FPS on average with a
minimum of 22 fps these results look CPU
limited but they obviously aren't in any
case all this does is prove that neither
GPU can handle the high quality preset
at 1080p and obviously the ultra quality
preset is certainly out of the question
as well Starcraft 2 is about the only
game I really ever play I love this
title but damn it just sucks when it
comes to CPU utilization the biggest
hurdle here is the horizon 3 1300 X or
at least the game's inability to
properly utilize this quad-core CPU for
testing now I am using a 4 V for replay
and skipping to the middle of the game
where the action is pretty thick so this
is really more of a CPU test than
pee-yew test admittedly because of this
we see much the same 1% low performance
using either the low or high quality
presets the rx 550 though did prove to
be the best option for this tile though
the margins weren't exactly big moving
on to the last game I tested player
unknowns battlegrounds and this is a
title that hates low-end GPUs using the
lowest possible quality settings at
1080p the GT 1030 averaged a console
like 32 FPS while the rx 550 managed
just 28 fps both did provide a horrible
experience so it's little consequence
that the GeForce GPU was faster here
obviously increasing the quality level
didn't help things and here the game is
completely unplayable if it wasn't
already finally when it comes to power
consumption they're both much of a
muchness as you might expect the GeForce
10 series car was slightly more fuel
efficient but even so overall system
consumption was just 9 percent lower
near the curve requires a PCIe power
connector and both run very cool so I
see this as somewhat of a non-issue for
these models picking between these two
entry-level discrete graphics cards
really isn't easy as we've just seen in
it will as it often does come down to
the games you play that said though the
only game that really threw up mixed
results was overwatch in that title we
saw if you're targeting high FPS and the
GT 1030 is the way to go
but if you do prefer to crack the
quality settings up a little bit and
sort of get a balance there of playable
performance with nice-looking visuals
and the rx 550 was better under those
conditions the rx 550 though I think
overall is probably a tougher sell I'll
get to those reasons why that is in a
moment when it comes to the performance
just seeing the rx 550 was clearly the
better choice for games such as
battlefield 1 and rocket League it was
also slightly better in StarCraft though
the margins there were less extreme
meanwhile the GeForce GT 1030 that was
miles better in player and owns
battlegrounds and quite surprisingly
quake champions had also provided a
better experience in Rainbow six siege
and dota 2 while it was slightly faster
and tiles such as counter-strike and
World of Tanks so given that if I had to
pick between these two cards if I could
only have one which is the situation
that many of you are faced with I think
overall this would be the one I'd get
now I have to say this MSI passively
cooled card was very neat indeed at ran
at very reasonable temperatures and yeah
it's passively cool I mean check it out
slim little card and to be cool in a
half-height chassis as well anyway there
is however the issue of whether or not
you should invest in these budget
entry-level cards to begin with in the
case of the rx 550 it's a seriously
tough sell even at the $80 US MSRP let
alone the $90 price they're currently
selling at for just $30 more the GTX
1050 is readily available and we
recently saw that model delivers around
90% more frames in games such as destiny
- at 1080p this means you're paying 33
percent more for around 90 percent more
performance and with that enables a much
more enjoyable gaming experience it's
sort of the same situation with the GT
1030 though from a price perspective it
does make a heck of a lot more sense the
GTX 1050 s around 70% more expensive so
the fact that it is again around 90
percent faster in games such as destiny
- isn't that bad when it comes to the
price versus performance ratio the $50
price gap here is quite large and it
really means that the GT 1030 is
genuinely a viable option even if the
GTX 1050 is overall better value for me
the GT 1030 is the perfect pairing for
something like a G 45 60 or that kind of
type budget each CPU which obviously
makes sense for a budget GPU and for me
the G 45 60 plus the GT 1030 that really
would be the ultimate budget esports
combine my opinion and just finally
before I wrap this up I will touch on
freesync
yes this card does support free sync
free sik monitors are cheap jisuk
monitors aren't so G sinks are really
not an option for this card whereas if
you have a free sync monitor you're
planning on getting one then yes this
may be a better option for me I think
I'd still gravitate towards the GT 1030
because it is just that bit faster and
some of the more important games that I
liked or the eSports tiles that I think
are a bit more important but totally up
to you or I'm just putting it out there
now I'm touching on it be aware that
free sync can offer a better experience
I'm not sure if eSports type gamers want
to use and adaptive sync technology
anyway but be aware of that here a
phrasing monitor this may be a better
choice anyway that's going to do
for this one hope you guys enjoyed the
benchmarks I'll probably do a bit more
testing with these in other triple-a
titles not just the eSport stuff if
there's a big enough demand I'm your
host Steve catch again next time
