I'm feeling a little under the weather
today but I can't let that stop me
because today's news story certainly
isn't going to wait so then what is
today's news story you ask it's official
finally AMD's next-generation CPU has
been named risin as many of you are no
doubt aware the codename for amber is
exciting new cpu series set to launch in
the first quarter of 2017 was zen AMD is
revealed that summit ridge will be the
code name for their desktop reisen
platform it will include a cebu of eight
cores and 16 threads with a base clock
of at least 3 point 4 gigahertz this is
the first time AMD has revealed clock
speed information and the company even
stated that while the engineering
samples are currently running at 3.4
gigahertz production units will be
clocked higher than that summit ridge
will also include frequency boost
technology although exact boost
frequencies haven't yet been determined
as for cash there will be plenty of it
the big boys will come loaded with a 16
megabyte level 3 and 4 megabyte level 2
cache putting that into perspective
Intel's upcoming cubby like core i7 7700
k will feature half as much level 3 cash
and four times less level 2 cache
bringing AMD well forward from where
they currently are now will be this
supporting am-4 platform which addresses
desperately needed features such as PCI
Express gen3 USB 3.1 gen2 support ddr4
memory and nvme storage AMD just
recently demonstrated a summit ridge
engineering sample running at 3.4
gigahertz without the Boost technology
enabled oh my dad and in a head-to-head
battle with a stock core i7 1,600 k it
fared very well for those of you unaware
the 6900 k is a 1100 dollar us broadway
lee enthuses grade c for you from Intel
which packs eight cores and 16 threads
it's clocked it between 3.2 and 3.7
gigahertz so it's an ideal and very
powerful processor to compare with AMD
showed some originally outperforming the
i760 100k in a handbrake video rendering
task completing the render a second or
so faster all
we weren't told the exact handbrake
configuration used the fact that summit
ridge managed to match the performance
of Broadway Lahey is very promising
indeed especially considering AMD is set
to introduce frequency boost and a
higher base clock speed closer to
release a stumbling block for AMD in the
past has been efficiency power
consumption figures haven't been great
horizon looks to fix this with
dramatically improved efficiency a few
months ago AMD use the 3d creation
software known as blender to demo
horizon or Zen as it was known at the
time anyway AMD's upcoming cpu allowed
for around 5 watts less total system
power consumption when compared to the
core i7 1600 ok AMD didn't reveal
exactly what was in each system so the
difference in system power consumption
could be explained by other components
though they did claim that it was an
apples-to-apples comparison summit ridge
was also shown consuming less total
system power at idle sitting at around
93 wats compared to the 107 wats of the
Intel system for those wondering at peak
bo systems jump to around 190 wats AMD
CEO Lisa soo has reiterated that the
company is on track to deliver a
40-percent performance in IPC over the
last generation products at the same
level of power consumption she went on
to say no games no gimmicks it's all
about delivering the real product and if
the demos are a true reflection of
Verizon and summit ridge AMD will be
delivering a modern CPU that can truly
compete with Intel's best aim DS also
touched on a number of reasons features
particularly surrounding a group of
technologies they call sense mi this is
essentially a brand for amd's network of
sensors and monitoring how we're built
into reisen which in itself isn't
anything we haven't seen before from
competing products or even AMD's last
gen hardware this technology is used in
five key areas of horizon that will help
deliver optimal performance and power
efficiency one such technology has been
dubbed pure power this is a closed loop
control system that optimizes clock
speeds deliver the best performance at
the lowest power levels AMD states that
pure power is used to enable lower power
for the same performance another
technology is precision boost which
works in tandem with pure power but
instead offers high performance at the
same power consumption level through
clock speed boosts of 25
increments then we have extended
frequency range or xfr for short this is
perhaps the most interesting feature as
it allows CPU to increase its clock
speed beyond the rated boost clock
frequencies depending on temperature
levels this sounds very similar to
nvidia's GPU boost 3.0 technology which
often boost pascal GPU is well beyond
their rated frequencies AMD says that
xfr will reward enthuses coolers by
allowing clock speeds to scale with
cooling solutions also included is smart
prefetch a technology that learns data
access patterns to prefetch necessary
data into the CPU cache so it can be
immediately accessed when and where
necessary finally have a neutral net
prediction these technology will pre
load instructions by anticipating the
actions of user will perform ahead of
time for those of you who came to learn
more be sure to check out AMD's live
stream i'll provide a link in the video
description short of that AMD will have
more to share about reisen and summit
ridge closer to the first quarter of
2017 s launch additionally risin CPUs
for servers are scheduled for launch in
the second quarter of 2017 while the
second half of 2017 will see the rise in
base to Raven Ridge ap use for low-power
devices AMD are going to be very busy
next year and I suppose so are we still
it's an exciting time to be a tech
enthusiast so stay tuned I'll catch you
guys in the next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
