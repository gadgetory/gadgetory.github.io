suppressor case series with a pair of
mid towers notice the f50 one and the
f30 one and both received glowing
reviews from professional tech reviewers
and consumers the highlights included
the great looks excellent clearance
performance wide range of configuration
possibilities and of course the client
operating volume thanks to the use of
effective sound deadening material
Thermaltake is now expanded the
suppressor series to support additional
form factors for introducing the
suppressor f1 a boxy little case
designed to accommodate mini ITX builds
measuring just 276 millimeters tall 260
millimeters wide and 319 millimeters
deep the f1 boasts a twenty 2.8 litre
capacity and weighs just three point two
kilos
despite its mostly steel construction
externally the f1 shares many of the
design attributes of its larger siblings
that's solid brush front panel is on
display while all the i/o gear can be
found at the left side of the facade
then one-take says the i/o panel has
been designed with the convenience and a
clean look in mind the panel features
dual USB 3 ports and HD audio connectors
together with the power and reset
buttons the convenience of the i/o
panels placement really depend on where
you sit the case for ultimate
convenience you want to see the f1 on
your desk and ideally on your right hand
side along with the front panel the
interchangeable side panels are also
well ventilated these symmetrical panels
allow users to build the system with
personality you can play around with the
panels and configure for either the best
viewing presentation or cooling
performance to magnetic side filters
found on the ventilated panels can be
easily removed for cleaning also a
removable PSU dust filter and adjustable
shockproof rubbers can be found on the
removable bottom panel around the back
we find an interesting layout the ATX
power supply bracket is located
centrally in the bottom of the case and
a horizontal orientation directly above
it is the motherboards IO panel followed
by the 280 millimeter fan grills there
are also two expansion slots to the
right which allow the f1 to support dual
slot graphics cards inside the
suppressor f1 has been divided into two
main chambers the upper chamber which
has all the core system components focus
on cooling performance while the lower
chamber is designed for the PSU cable
management and
which devices speaking of storage def
one can accommodate a pair of three and
a half inch drives and two two and a
half inch drives all of which are hidden
in the lower chamber drives are mounted
on a pair of custom drive racks which
slide into the f1 once the drives are
attached even with a large ATX power
supply installed there's plenty of room
to tuck away access cabling the lower
chamber which helps create a neat
looking build I should also note the f1
will accept power supplies as long as
200 millimeters up top there's enough
room for 140 millimeter tall CPU cooler
while a dual slow graphics card as long
as 255 millimeters will fit it's
possibly go as long as 285 millimeters
for the graphics card but the back side
of the car will end up being the front
panel now that we've seen in and around
the suppressor f1 it's time to stock it
with some hardware and conduct some
thermal testing at the moment one of my
older home theater pcs is built in a
sleek little Silverstone RV zero one and
for this review I thought it might be
interesting to move the hardware from
that build into the f1 of course before
doing so I'll grab some temperatures for
the CPU and GPU installed in the RVs
that I won and then compare them to the
f1 the hardware in question is an Intel
Core i5 46 70 K running on an A drugs
dead 87 EIT X it's an odd motherboard
now I know but it still works so well
plugged in a 16 GB ddr3 memory and a
gigabyte Radeon r9 290x the biggest
cooler I can fit inside the Raven RVs
that are one was the Silverstone
nitrogen series nto 6 pro someone takes
f1 will support much taller coolers and
low profile models like the mt o 6 pro
aren't required however an effort to
keep the thermal results comparable
we're stuck with the nitrogen series
cooler coming from the RBS that r1 it
has to be said that the installation
process for the suppressor f1 is
considerably more user-friendly where
half the system needs to be disassembled
in order to change a hard drive or the
power supply on the Raven this isn't the
case at all with the f1 all the panels
are removable and this makes
installation extremely quick and easy
sliding off the bottom panel to install
the power supply made life easy and
helped to create a neat and tidy build
speaking of which there aren't really
any innovative cable management features
offered by the f1 rather the design
lends itself to good cable management
the only part of a design I didn't love
with the drive cages
a little too crude in my opinion as I
found removing them and reattaching them
very cumbersome the drive brackets don't
clip in a place really well and I found
myself having to squeeze slash force
them back in other than that for such a
tiny computer case the installation
process was surprisingly straightforward
and I appreciate the fact that you can
install or remove virtually all the
components without first having to
remove something else
performance-wise the thermal tech
suppressor f1 is extremely quiet and
although I don't have any scientific
data to show you it is quieter than the
Raven RVs that are one unfortunately the
temperatures weren't quite as good as
the I visitor one is the system on a
hole around a few degrees warmer nothing
alarming but certainly not an
improvement either had the front mounted
200 millimeter fan being able to spin a
little faster than 800 RPM we feel the
temperatures could have been greatly
improved some users have suggested that
the suppressor f1 is very similar to
coarse as obsidian 250 D while there are
a number of similarities the cases are
still quite different perhaps the
biggest difference however is the price
well the 250 D is currently selling for
$80 the f1 cost is $50 or 78 UD so it
quickly becomes apparent that the f1 is
very competitively priced throughout the
review I had to keep reminding myself
that this is just a $50 case and this
helps to excuse a few of the areas where
the build quality was a bit suspect the
magnetic dust filters on each of the
side panels for example kept falling
apart when removed now to reattach the
magnetic strips all the time the perspex
window is pretty poor as well mine had
some brown flakes that looked a lot like
cardboard and grained in it which was
odd perspex also scratched and scuffed
very easily which was a shame still
keeping that $50 price tag in mind the
suppressor f1 has a lot to offer budget
mini-itx builders for a case that can
handle large tower style CPU coolers
full length graphics cards large ATX
power supplies the f1 is shockingly
small as mentioned it's very easy to
work with and once complete it's easy to
go back and change components the
thermal performance is respectable too
particularly given how quiet the cases
the slightly larger size of the
suppressor f1 gives it an advantage over
most mini ITX cases in this price range
when it comes to hardware support and
ease of installation while I really like
the silverstone Sugo SG 13 cooler Master
Elite 120 advanced &amp;amp; fractal design no
304 for example the more compact design
of these
cases makes them how to live with if you
update Hardware on a regular basis part
of the reason why I hadn't upgraded my
IV 0-1 system is so long was down to the
fact that it's a real job to change
anything in that case thanks for joining
me for another hardware unbox product
review
I'm your host Matt and I'd love to hear
what you guys think in the comments or
