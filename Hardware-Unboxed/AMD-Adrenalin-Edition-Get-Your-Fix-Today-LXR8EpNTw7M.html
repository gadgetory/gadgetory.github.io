that time of the year again when AMD
overhaul their drivers for the most part
though this time around things do look
much the same we are dealing with the
same graphical user interface that was
introduced with the Crimson Edition
driver back in 2015 last year though we
got the Crimson relive Edition and well
that added a few swanky new features
such as relive that was aimed ease
answer - shadow play we also got radio
and chill a number of performance
improvements for a heap of triple-a
tiles that were released in 2016
vicinity of three to four percent
depending on the game overall I have to
say the Crimson a real live Edition that
was a really nice driver update and
added some much-needed features and it
also gave the RX 480
a shot in the arm and it definitely
needed that against the gtx 1060 but it
brought things up to a fairly even
playing field and all the features
though did work flaws i have to say i am
they expanded what mans support for
example and that really just made it
crashed more than ever what meds
functionality that has it really
improved this year things continue to
get pretty dicey with the release of a
go anyway making the next step in the
evolution of the AMD radeon software is
the adrenalin addition sounds
exhilarating so what does the gentleman
have for us artfully designed
meticulously crafted incredibly
intuitive utterly beautiful gee guys
calm down it's just a driver update and
the user interface hasn't even changed
with the exception of three new color
themes alright so there are 78 slides in
the press deck and I'm gonna spare you
by skipping over the majority of them
there are a few cool features and I want
to cover them but I'll do them towards
the end of the video I'll start with
what I felt were the less exciting
things but still worth covering starting
with performance games Amy makes a
pointless comparison by saying the
adrenaline driver offers up to 19
percent gains over the original Crimson
relive driver I'd hope so since four of
the five games they showed were released
after the real live driver was first
introduced now moving on we have some
reduced latency claims over the more
recent hurry live Edition 17-point 11.1
drama so that's kind of neat
improvements were noted for csgo pub G
titanfall 2 and Rainbow six siege
apparently those playing pub G can
expect up to an 18 percent reduction in
latency and we're talking about an 18
percent improvement and click to
response time this really isn't
something that I can accurately test at
the moment so I focused on fps
performance measuring the average one
percent and point one percent low
results here's a quick look at the
results I had also planned to include
results for the new Star Wars
Battlefront 2 title but the game doesn't
detect the new adrenaline driver and
therefore refuses to load so we won't
get to witness the viewer rage in the
comment section for including that one
what a shame opportunity missed in
addition to the two main games I wanted
to check out which was pubsey and csgo I
also checked out battlefield one for the
testing I used an air called Vega 64
graphics card and found that the average
frame rate in csgo was boosted by 7%
though the change from the 1 percent and
1 percent low result was minimal the
gains for battlefield 1 and pub G were
even less and despite basing them on a
three run average I'd say that some of
the margins seen are still within the
margin of error so this time around we
don't seem to be seeing any gains with
Vega certainly not like what we saw at
the RX 480 so that's a bit of a shame
moving on
the adrenaline Driver offers borderless
windowed multi GPU support so that's
good for whoever's foolish enough to be
using 2 AMD or nvidia gpus in 2017 let's
suppose moving on f RTC or frame rate
target control now support the vulcan
titles all of them apparently you now
have support for doom and Wolfenstein
dota 2 that adds vulcan support doesn't
it oh and it was recently added to ashes
of the benchmark so for those games and
any I'm possibly forgetting you can now
cap frame rates to reduce power draw and
GPU operating temperature for me though
I'm all about those burning fast fps so
this feature just isn't for me you can
now set the GPU workload from graphics
to compute for enhanced compute
performance so when mining AMD says when
setting this option to the compute
profile it will
the RX 570s a theory and minor
performance by 15% so it looks like mine
is probably stand to gain the most from
this driver update at least in terms of
performance something kind of cool is
the new connection tab it's not
mind-blowing or anything but it's a neat
little addition the connection tab
houses three sub menus gallery account
and a resource center the gallery allows
gamers to manage their relive captured
footage here it's possible to share and
upload captures and there's even some
basic editing functionality for
uploading you can manage accounts in the
appropriately named accounts tab access
to services such as YouTube twitch
Twitter and various other social media
platforms exists then finally you can
stay in the radio and loop with the
Resource Center this is probably more
beneficial for AMD's marketing team but
who knows you might find some cool stuff
in there every now and then Ami's also
made some tweaks and improvements to the
real live feature the impact on frame
rate performance has now been lessened
by up to a claimed 84 percent there's
now also support for borderless region
capture which means you can capture only
what you want by selecting a specific
window you can now use AMD eyefinity
with real life to capture footage across
multiple monitors and finally it's also
possible record a separate audio track
so you can separate your mic input from
the game's audio and that's a pretty
cool feature and definitely in addition
worth having one of the coolest though
is the new Radeon overlay feature an
in-game pop-up menu that allows you to
adjust settings on the fly and monitor
performance to enable this feature you
simply have to hit Alt + R and it will
just fade in from the right of screen
this menu system for me is an amazing
addition and it really is a must to
utilize all the various features now on
offer in the Radeon software
AMD slide chapter 6 menus though my
Vegas 64 setup had just four that's
probably because I can't enable certain
features like free sync for example
still the four I had were very useful if
you're not a fan of messing around with
hotkeys or maybe they just aren't
working for whatever reason in some
games and this has been a problem in the
past you can start recording from this
menu you can also adjust every possible
setting imaginable on the fly in-game
you can change performance monitoring
metrics and even a
just the update intervals other features
such as radio and chill can be enabled
or disabled on the fly and you can even
adjust color properties it's a cool
feature it seems to work perfectly and
it's one that I very much love and
appreciate being added complementing the
awesome Radeon overlay feature is AMD
link
AMD link is an app that's available on
Android or iOS devices so smartphones
and tablets for example and it allows
gamers to monitor and use features from
their mobile device
for example if you had your phone
propped up on a dock in front of your
monitor you can show a number of
performance metrics such as FPS GP usage
RAM usage clock speeds and so on you can
also enable Radeon relive and control
all the settings there obviously this
kind of thing is quicker and easier just
to do via hot keys on your keyboard but
it's nice to have the ability to enable
and disable remotely it's a new free
added feature so sure why not are the
on-screen stats though those can get in
the way when you're playing so it's kind
of nice to be able to put them upload
them to another screen and you can also
monitor that again remotely if someone
else is gaming on your system and you
want to see yeah I don't know where I
was going with that one I don't know
time will tell how useful that feature
is yep
moving on you can add multiple pcs to it
quite quickly and easily so that's nice
so overall it's a neat little addition
but I think I'm more impressed with the
array on overlay feature that's actually
on your screen so that menu that you can
pop up in games that's really neat and I
like that in conclusion I have to say
that it's really nice to see these
yearly big updates continue from AMD and
while not as impressive as last year's
update the adrenaline Edition has some
cool new features for Radeon users and I
said at the end of the day they're free
so pretty hard to complain with that
anyway that's it for this one I'm your
host Steve see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
