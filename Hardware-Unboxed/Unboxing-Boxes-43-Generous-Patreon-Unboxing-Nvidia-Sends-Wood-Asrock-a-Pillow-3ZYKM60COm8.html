unboxing boxes the series where we take
boxes out of boxes sometime packages but
usually boxes and if you're really lucky
we'll take the hardware out of the
product box and that's why we call this
channel harbor unboxed right so we're
gonna start with this box here because
this one is a bit special it's been sent
in to us not by a company but by a
patron member so Zed Zed are Hardy he
hit me up on discord discord server
quite a few weeks ago now and he said
Steve I've got a spare 64 gigabyte
memory kit I want to send in for you
guys to use I was like ok 64 gigabytes
of thinking is this some old ddr3 memory
a whole stack of 4 gigabyte sticks or
something said no it's for 16 gigabyte
modules of ddr4 3000 memory from Corsair
he bought two kits or something like
that he couldn't use one of them it was
just sitting on his shelf for whatever
reason he couldn't or didn't return it
and he just said look I want to send it
to you guys to support the channel so
that blew me away massively I kind of
found it hard to believe because that's
some serious money there in memory about
$1,300 dollars very very generous but
anyway he sent it in and it's time to
unbox it so I'm I'm kind of thinking
it's some sort of joke there's there's
something I don't know I really don't
know what to think it seems far too
generous
but Tim is in need of memory for his
editing or itself it is a 64 gigabyte
ddr4 kit it will be going in Tim's
engineering to help him make videos a
bit quicker and a bit easier because he
only has 16 gigs at the moment
okay so let's find out if there is a 64
gigabyte kid in here or if Zed Zed are
Hardy is having some sort of bit of fun
with me let's have a look here all right
well that's looking about the size of a
memory kit
Wow well it's it's an unopened box
it's definitely brand new factory sealed
box and it is for 16 gigabyte 3000 64
gigabyte cute ddr4 memory I I don't even
know really to say that's amazing
well let's get into it and have a look
yeah it's the real deal
64 gigabytes of ddr4 memory I really
don't know what to say how to thank SEDs
Ed Hardy for sending this stuff in
that's just phenomenal helps us out
massively and you guys are probably
sitting there thinking oh you guys get
memory for free all the time whatnot
well not really because it's always got
some sort of shrink attached often we're
just loading it for a build or you know
we have to do a lot of work to actually
get it have to produce a lot of videos
and content and guarantee X amount of
use the fact that we get this just from
a supporter is yeah
mind-blowing obviously I don't expect
everyone or really anyone to support us
to this degree but yeah just yeah blow
me I don't really know what to say yeah
I was kind of convinced it was a joke
the spirit sentence in a 64 gig ddr4
memory key especially with the way
pricing is these days it's brand-new oh
well that was amazing all right next up
we have some packages here from Nvidia
so we'll check it those out first I'll
maybe say all right this one here I
think is for a build I'm doing it soon
yes it is so I won't go over this for
too long all right so this is a geforce
gtx 1072 you've seen this exact msi gary
model on the channel before I did a
build with a benchmark to the hell out
of it and I now have a second one not
for SLI my original one I'll be keeping
for benchmark in the future this one
will be going to someone else I am doing
a guest build and that will be hopefully
middle of next month
so that's something I look forward to it
actually pretty cool and that is what
this is for
move on nvidia has also sent over
another little package and this is a
Christmas gifts I'm opening this a bit
late sorry about the new video and I've
sent along a few things as a Christmas
present so what do we have yeah go a
little beaten up in the mail
ah ok there Christmas tree ornaments
very cool there you go my kids will love
that GeForce GTX though they'll really
appreciate that one little wooden
ornament and of course another one
might hang them up in the studio I think
and another one so there you go three
wooden ornaments they actually do look
very cool so I actually do like those
I'll decorate the office with them so
thank you for that in video they are
rather neat I quite like those see sonic
sent along a neat little calendar which
unfortunately I won't use because I do
all that digitally and a little
Christmas card which I'll check out
later thank you for a seat honey and
finally the last of the Christmas gifts
is one from asrock I'm not sure what
they have sent so let's get into it and
find out looks like we have a good
assortment of goodies here so we've got
a little asrock binder that's themed
like their motherboards that's pretty
cool that's really nice a Christmas card
handwritten and signed by the Azrael
teams that's very cool I'll read that in
a bit more detail soon looks like we
have a cap here and asrock themed cap
very cool I'm not sure what's in this
it's very heavy though it looks like
it'll probably be a mouse pad or
something
what is this oh it's blowing up it's
insightly
it's an as rocker cushion that's
actually pretty cool that'll also find
its way into the studio or office it's
what their Tai Chi board theme on the
back doing well out of these Christmas
presents here
and the mystery tube that is indeed a
mousepad so what do we got the thread
Ripper boards suppose I should show you
guys what it looks like it's a very cool
looking mousepad there you go oh I will
use that upstairs in the benchmark lab
so thread rip up mousepad very cool all
right
well that does it for the Christmas
presents next up we've got two packages
left and one of them is once again
suspiciously keyboard shape haven't had
a keyboard on the series for a few
episodes now so hopefully this isn't
even bright so what we have here is the
duckie 1/2 and I believe this is one of
their more affordable keyboards we've
looked at a few duckies on the channel
and they've been very expensive like up
around 300 or $300 plus
Australian so quite expensive this one I
believe is about 160 dollars right now
PC case gear I'll chuck a link for
fellow Aussies in the video description
if you can get this on Amazon on Newegg
or anywhere like that in the state so
anyway let's have a look and see what
we've got here so this particular
keyboard is blue and orange themed which
is quite out there so you've got some
orange key caps and a black in Turkey
there that you can repair or the orange
in Turkey is pre-installed so you've got
the dark bluish one so you can have it
as a blue sort of dark blue theme or you
can go with the eye catching orange here
so I believe you can get pretty much the
full range of Cherry MX switches they
haven't got a silver model which i think
is similar to the Reds but this one here
has the
which I quite like the brown there a bit
quieter but they've still got a really
nice feel through them so the keys feel
great they are double shot
PBT and they're non backlit so there's
no LED lighting on this but as I said it
is 160 Australian dollars which is quite
affordable for a higher quality
mechanical keyboard especially from
ducky on the back you'll find two stage
feet so you can have it up on just a
slight angle or you can go a bit more
aggressive with your angle if you want
something quite cool is that the cable
is to touch them all so if you happen to
damage the cable or anything like that
the keyboard won't be a throw away and
it is a Type C detachable keyboard so
it's a lot easier to get in and you can
use sort of modern cables if you want to
get a braided type-c cable you could but
obviously being a type C that will pop
in any old way and there are some
channels to to run the cable left or
right if you wanted to or can just come
straight out the front and it looks like
we've got about a two meter one point 8
meter cable has a type a USB - it looks
like at the other end to go into your PC
and there is no USB pass or anything
like that so just the detachable cable
there's no aluminium or anything like
that for the top plate it's just a thick
durable plastic plastic all around but
it does feel very solid very rigid and
then you get this neat little key puller
and I will pull the keys off I'll
install the orange ones and I'll throw
up some b-roll and show you guys what it
looks like with the orange key caps on
but I imagine it's very eye-catching
very out-there and finally it comes with
a one-year warranty which obviously
isn't that extensive so quite a limited
warranty but then it is more of you are
not expensive or harassing sales but it
is more of your entry level budget
mechanical keyboard but I suspect it
will last well over one year so anyway
thanks for PC case Kia for sending this
in I'll probably throw this on one of my
test systems and give it a whirl over
the next few weeks and see what I think
of it alright last up we have this box
here from or even reven is a brand I
haven't actually seen before
tested any of their puffs they've sent
along a few items for us to check out I
believe so let's get into it have a look
all right so we have some RGB light
strips that's probably three in the pack
but I'm not sure actually get into it
and find out before I start saying
things I have no idea I'm talking about
two - there you go
not three - so you get two RGB light
strips - they're magnetic so that's very
cool you can see the magnets every
couple of inches and apparently there is
I thought it said on the box that there
is an adhesive strip and it looks like
as usual after looking the box so there
are some stickers here some 3m stickers
that you can peel off and stick on here
for double sided tape if you want to use
that rather than the magnet so I suppose
if you're putting on a plastic surface
or something like that where the magnets
won't work you do have those so it's not
the usual one where they're
pre-installed and you just peel it off
which is a bit more convenient but
anyway not the end of the world and you
can daisy chain these two together if
you just want to make one long one so
they'll clip in like so there you go or
you can use them individually with the
cables provided and these will plug in
too if you've got a controller that
should work otherwise they'll just go
into the header on your motherboard and
it supports all the usual stuff so
they're pretty cool I don't actually
have a price on these I couldn't find
them on Newegg Amazon or anywhere in
Australia so I'm not sure what how much
reven is charging for these so pretty
cool light strip I'll probably feature
those in a bill at some point not to use
in future I love a bit of RGB in the
builds we do then we have a Koran Kiran
Kiran RGB fan so we have just one of
those so I probably won't use in the
build but these cat these as you can see
here they are sold separately so you can
just buy one which is kind of nice and
it doesn't require a fancy control or
any sort of additional cost like that
there's just a switch here and by
pushing that you can rotate between
colors and effects and that just has a
four pin PWM fan connected there for
your motherboards fan header or
controller if you're using one so
looking on the box here we
have seven colors and three lighting
modes to choose from so that's pretty
cool the fan works at between 400 and
1500 rpm you get a 2-year warranty and
the best bit is it costs just fifteen
dollars u.s. which isn't dirt cheap but
for an RGB fan that looks pretty cool
which I'll drop some b-roll and show you
guys how it actually looks that is very
cheap you're sort of looking at more
like $30.00 feeling more custom ones
with a bit more control so yeah kind of
half price there your budget RGB 120
millimeter fan then lastly we have the
nya no no yeah it is an all-in-one 240
millimeter rad liquid cooler and this is
pretty cool because you can service this
particular model I'll go the box and
we'll talk about it a bit more there
aren't many reviews on this particular
model yet though there are there are one
or two from reliable sources and they
were very impressed with what it had to
offer so there are a few unique things
about this all-in-one that make it a bit
different from all well I suppose
there's a whole lot of all-in-one
coolers these days pretty much
everyone's offering one but this one has
a few unique things as I said one of
them is that you can top it up so over
time if you know bit of water is
absorbed or evaporated or whatever you
can fill it up and it's cool it's clear
housing so you can see the bubbles in it
as well and the fill port is here so you
would unscrew that like so there you go
a little bit wet on top but this one
doesn't need any filling because there's
hardly any air in it do that back up
give it a little quick wipe with a cloth
and yeah you're good to go I looked at a
pretty good all-in-one a 240 millimeter
only one recently from aro cool that's
very cool lot of RGB RGB fans also had a
clear housing which was RGB lit and that
made for some awesome effects this one
though is a no frills affair so there's
no RGB lighting no fancy effects the
pump just plugs in via a three pin fan
cable so it'll go into a motherboard
header that supports pumps then the fans
that go on the radiator well they're
also pretty bland there's definitely no
RGB here just a standard black kind of
fan
for pin header which again will go to
your motherboard or a fan controller and
there's not a whole lot to say about
those but there are 120 millimeter black
fans so you might be thinking well
that's a pretty boring only one I mean
you know looks okay but spicing it up a
bit you do get three color dyes so
you've got a red blue and what looks to
be a green so you can put the dye in
there and that'll change the color of
the water and therefore this and then
you've got some lighting around it with
maybe your RGB strips and that'll give a
pretty cool effect in your PC and it is
a hundred and ten dollars so it's still
reasonably pricey but that is pretty
competitive for a 240 millimeter
all-in-one especially with the unique
unique features that this one has and
from what I've seen the performance is
very good so yeah no frills cooler that
performs well something else cool about
this is that it has a wrap design and
it's water above pipe design so this
means the cooler can be installed and
are again tailored without sacrificing
the pumping power so that's very cool so
it really have to worry about how you
only take this in your case pretty much
anyway will work of course one of the
highlights here is that refillable tank
so it basically means you can service
this unit so you can flush the pump and
the radio to give that a clean out and
then put some more cool and back in
there so that will help it last a bit
longer now out of the box you can
install this on pretty much every AMD
and Intel platform out there with the
exception of thread Ripper you will have
to purchase the upgradable tr4 kit
separately so that doesn't come in the
package but you can purchase that if you
plan on using this with thread Ripper
and the the cold plate the base of the
cooler is rather large it won't cover
our thread Ripper CPU entirely but it is
still quite big so it'll do better than
most of the coolers out there and yet on
that note the performance that I have
seen from other review outlet is very
very good for this model so it's no
slouch there when it comes to cooling
and it does a great job or making very
little noise that's also impressive the
only drawbacks of this product are
availability which at the moment is
basically non-existent it was selling on
Amazon for a little while there for a
hundred and ten us
it's not currently available on Amazon
it's not on Newegg it's available
nowhere in Australia so I don't actually
know where you can buy at the moment
hopefully they will help solve or they
will work to solve the availability
problem shortly and then the other
drawback here is that it does have a
limited two-year warranty so I mean for
the price that's not too bad but there
are quite a few competing products that
have up to five year warranty so I would
like to see the warranty period extended
for this product if possible and well
that is going to do it for this episode
of unboxing boxes once again I would
just like to give a massive thank you to
Zed Zed Hardy for sending in this memory
really can't even express how much Tim
and I appreciate that really can you put
this in Tim's editing or Iggy's Rison 7
1718 rig that only has 16 gigabytes at
the moment up great at 64 gigabytes and
see how much easier it is for him to
edit and encode on that system so yeah
thank you so much for sending this in
it's really blown me away and thanks the
PC case key for sitting in the new cable
that I'll chuck on one of the test
systems and use that a bit cool to check
out the reven products the all in one in
particular is very interested very
interesting I'm keen to check out this
fan which you guys probably will have
seen by a noun how good it looks so
hopefully it looked pretty good yeah
it's a pretty good price on that one the
light strips are cool
all the cool give some products I love
this mousepad I'm definitely going to be
using that I've got my cap I've got my
Christmas decorations but I'll hang up
in the office in various spots you'll
see them in the background before too
long and my pillow
so got my rock pillow so that's that's
pretty comfy I'll chuck that on the
couch and yeah anyway I hope you guys
enjoyed this episode of unboxing boxes
there'll be another episode quite soon
because over the Christmas break I have
a massive amount of boxes that I have to
get through and I'm putting together an
amazing epic the biggest baddest build
I've ever done on the channel will be
coming up next month and I'm starting to
get pressed for that so I'm very excited
about that I'll be able to show you some
of the products that are coming in for
that build anyway that's going to do it
for this one thanks for watching
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
