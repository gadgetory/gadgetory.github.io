are looking at high speed storage
performance by comparing the flagship
aimed in Intel mainstream desktop
chipsets with aiders latest and greatest
XP GSX 8200 PCIe gen3 x 4m to 20 to 80
960 gigabyte solid state drive do I have
to say that every time the SX 8200 is an
nvme SSD packing an insane read and
write throughput 3.2 gigabytes per
second when reading and 1.7 gigabytes
per second when writing as a super-fast
nvme SSD it's perfect for comparing
these storage performance of AMD's x4 70
and intel z3 17 chipsets before getting
to the result so let's talk a little bit
about this new SSD that a data has sent
over for us to check out and they have
generously sent along the big nine
hundred and sixty gigabyte model and now
it's just a few months ago now the SX
8200 Series packs the latest controller
from silicon motion the SM 2262
supporting eight down channels and ARM
Cortex r5 quad-core nvme 3.1 raid and
more connected to the controller for 64
layer three detail scene and memory
chips from micron as well as two nano
ddr3 DRAM chips which act as a high
speed buffer unlike most nvme SSDs the
SX 8200 family uses the m2 2280 form
factor and for maximum performance takes
advantage of the pcie 3.0 x 4 interface
for now this series offers 240 gigabyte
480 by and 960 gigabyte models and
pricing is extremely competitive Intel
were the first to adopt the silicon
motion SM 2262 controller with their 760
p series and today the one terabyte
model can be had for 370 dollars u.s. HP
though has since undercut them with the
ax 920 which cost just 300 dollars u.s.
for the one terabyte model unfortunately
a data hasn't been out of beat HP as the
960 gigabyte SX 8200 comes in at 350
dollars u.s. that said for those of you
interested in the much cheaper 240
gigabyte and 256 gigabyte models
hey Dad there is much more competitive
here while there 240 gigabyte model is
selling for just $90 u.s. HP are asking
a hundred and ten dollars u.s. and Intel
one hundred and fifteen dollars u.s. a
data also offers a premium five-year
warranty and 160 terabytes written for
the base model 320 terabytes written for
the 480 gigabyte version and a massive
640 terabytes written for the 960 gear
baak model that we have on hand for
testing ok so now for some information
about today's test for testing on these
EV 370 platform we're using the as
rockers at 370 type sheet which features
three m2 slots and like most said 370
motherboards they're all connected to
the chipset in total the said 370
chipset supports a maximum of 30
high-speed input/output pathways and six
of them are dedicated as USB 3.0 ports
that leaves 24 to be divided up for PCI
eSATA and USB 3.0 in total at I cheat
has 34 lanes which doesn't quite work
what they've done here is share lanes so
if you happen to use all the m2 slots
then half the SATA ports would be
disabled for example the three pcie 3.0
x 16 slots found on the zed 370 types
you're all connected directly to the CPU
and therefore don't share bandwidth with
any of the m2 slots for the zed 370
platform this isn't a big issue as this
chipset connects to the cpu using the
third-generation direct media interface
or DMI 3.0 and this allows for a
throughput of 3.9 three gigabytes per
second this is quite a bit more than the
lower-end h3 10 chipset for example
which uses the older DMI 2.0 interface
and therefore is limited to a bandwidth
of just 2 gigabytes per second
this is often a problem for high-speed
nvme SSDs as it can significantly reduce
their performance this is also why it's
very important that those who own an
nvme SSD need to be careful about where
they stick it even on the latest and
greatest AMD x4 70 motherboards this is
because the x4 70 chipset only has a
pcie 2.0 x 4 link so it suffers the same
bandwidth limitations as that of the h3
10 chip set the asrock x4 70 Taichi used
for testing features 2 m2 slots the
slot which is referred to as m-21 is
connected directly to the CPU and
therefore enjoys a pcie 3.0 x 4 link the
second slot however which is called m2 2
is connected to the chipset and
therefore is limited to pcie 2.0 x 4
bandwidth in other words 2 gigabytes per
second using a single nvme SSD like the
ADATA SX 8200 how much impact does this
have on performance well let's go find
out shall we
first up we have the sequential read and
write performance in the a SSD benchmark
this is a challenging benchmark for SSDs
as it doesn't use any compressible data
for these tests so it's often considered
as a sort of worst case scenario this
means while other benchmarks might show
sequential read performance hitting 3 to
3 point 2 gigabytes per second here we
are limited to 2 point 7 gigabytes per
second which by all accounts is still
blazing fast bright performance though
is where you'd expect it to be given the
SX 8200 is rated for 1.7 gigabytes per
second now you can see here while these
n3 17 X 470 platforms delivered very
similar results when using the pcie 3.0
x fault connection we see when running
the SSD through the chipset on the X 470
board the performance is severely
limited the read throughput was reduced
by 50% while the write bandwidth was
reduced by almost 20% here we see that
because performance is much slow and
making a single 4k file read or write
the limited bandwidth of the x4 17
chipset configuration isn't that
impactful that said though we still do
see a 13% decrease in write performance
in this test 64 requests for 4k data are
being made simultaneously though I have
to say this is more of a server type
workload general computing usually only
makes a few simultaneous requests still
this is a better test for maxing out
SSDs random 4k read and write
performance here we see when connected
to the x4 70 chipset throughput is
limited by almost 30% when looking at
the write performance
here's a quick look at the access times
be aware that lower is better here
the Rison platform has an advantage here
when connected directly to the CPU and
this has helped it to slightly reduce
the read access time next up we have the
so file test which is an undisguised
system was a smidgen faster than the
core i7 system when connected to the CPU
however connecting the SSD to the
chipset reduced performance by almost
25% limiting throughput to just 1.4
gigabytes per second the program copy
test features a large number of small
non compressed files and as a result the
throughput is significantly reduced this
time we only see a 10% reduction in
throughput for the Rison platform and
connecting via the chipset though this
is still a decent reduction in
throughput then we have the game copy
test which features a mixture of small
and large compressed and non compressed
files and this time we see a 13%
reduction of throughput for the arisin
system when connecting via the chipset
that said it should be noted that even
the more optimal CPU connection for the
Rison platform was still 8 percent
slower than the Intel's at 370 system
using an 8700 K the auto disk benchmark
uses compressible data so we see the
sequential read performance peak at
around 3 gigabytes per second once we
hit file sizes of 128 kilobytes the
horizon and core i7 performance is much
the same at least when connecting the
SSD directly to the CPU on the Rison
system the Rison rig was 20% slower
working with files smaller than 128
kilobytes which is fairly significant
and again we see that it was much slower
at once connected via the chipset
especially for the larger file size
tests finally this time when measuring
write performance the Zed 370 platform
using the 87 hurricane was faster
throughout the ad ODIs benchmark tests
well there you have it using what is now
a fairly typical nvme SSD it is possible
to reduce read performance by as much as
50% on an AM 4 motherboard if you
install it in a wrong m2 slot throughout
our testing it seemed like though for
the most part you will be looking at
about a 10 to 20 percent reduction in
throughput
truth be told though this kind of
reduction in throughput likely won't be
noticed for day-to-day tasks including
things like gaming
loading games that is so for the most
part it's not really a serious issue
still if you've paid good money for a
blazing fast SSD and you'll want to
ensure the absolute fastest read and
write performance you might as well make
sure you whack it in the right slot
making this job a little easier is the
fact that the motherboard makers do
space
find the bandwidth for the m2 slots so
be sure to consult the manual to make
sure you're getting all the jeebies
you should be as for Intel uses it's a
little more simplified by the fact that
the chipset has full bandwidth through
the CPU so the slowdown via the chipset
is very minimal
as for a data's xpg SX 8200 it's a
cracking good value nvme SSD
particularly the 240 gigabyte and 480
gigabyte models I suppose the next step
now would be to try and get my hands on
a second drive for some raid testing
that would no doubt deliver some
interesting results on these platforms
