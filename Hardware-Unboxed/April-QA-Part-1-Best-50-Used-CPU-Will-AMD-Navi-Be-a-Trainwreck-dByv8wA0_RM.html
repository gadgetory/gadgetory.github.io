just finished a live stream build so
we've been madly cleaning up there was
stuff everywhere hopefully you guys are
a lot of you saw that if you missed it I
recommend going back and watching it was
a lot of fun thank you to everyone who
did watch it live but anyway that is
over and we've cleaned up announced time
for the monthly QA but we're kind of a
month late on that because Tim got sick
blamed Tim yeah so technically there
will be two QA this month one later in
the month but so this is the April Q&amp;amp;A
so let's just pretend it's till April
yep
April QA this is part one so let's jump
into the questions okay
since Tim's feeling a bit under the
weather I thought we'd kick this off
with a nice comment to lift Tim spirit
and a mavis has come to the rescue with
that just came here to say I love you
guys oh what a nice comment thank you
very much a marason we love you guys
alright now that we've got that out of
the way let's move on
hub HQ set up tour that is the next
question I assume they're asking could
we do 101 one we do a lot of sort of
stuff for the patreon behind-the-scenes
stuff and not just because we want you
guys to pay to see that
but there's well it's not really main
channel quality content to be honest
with you yeah we just you know get in
front of a camera for 15 minutes show
you show you some things yeah I think
both of our setup tours at this point
are probably a little old for what's
kind of going on at the moment at least
for me I'm about to move so there's
definitely going to be a few HQ typed
behind the scenes stuff coming soon
yeah just triggered a thought may
perhaps we could look at making our old
behind the scenes videos public on a hub
actuation channel so all our patreon
behind-the-scenes videos goes go on a
hub extras channel so not this channels
a separate channel that we have for
those videos but maybe we could link
them or something and make a couple of
them public because they're just
unlisted that something to do next
question do you think that the RT x 2070
will be more powerful than the PS 5s GPU
any thoughts on that Tim I kind of go to
Tim for consoles I don't really follow
the console stuff too much I probably
should because if they're starting to
cross over a bit more but yeah this
these looks questions always interest me
a lot because you sort of with the
console you don't need as much GPU power
to get the same you know performance
because of the optimization of console
so you know the P something like a ps4
Pro is probably approaching RT X 20s I
mean it's not not gonna be quite they're
probably more RT X 2060 level okay but
certainly you know sort of pretty decent
performance out of that in the Xbox one
X as well
so yeah I would think that if the PS
files coming in that want to do a pretty
powerful sort of system that sort of
talking a lot about 4k you know actual
good quality 4k gaming it's hard to know
because we don't have any anything to go
on really well that's true but I would
say that it's probably going to be more
powerful than an RT X 2017 it's probably
my guess yeah almost based on what
you've just said there almost wouldn't
be worth releasing it if it wasn't so
yeah because that you think that the
base ps5 would be more powerful than the
ps4 Pro there wouldn't be a lot of point
no there wouldn't be and how long does
the PS 5 have to last in the market yeah
as long it's been seven years eight
years yeah so I imagine we're well
probably shouldn't say this for right
now but imagine we're desktop GPU
performance should be in seven years
time yeah like it'll be unrecognizable
hopefully should be yeah it'll be
powerful yeah all right you want to read
out the next question for us I will okay
hello hard were unboxed I've been
wondering if the upcoming third gen
Rison were to get the rumored 15% IPC
increase will it be able to outperform
current gen Intel CPUs in gaming what do
you think thanks to the reviews and
benchmarks a tremendous help for gamers
yeah okay thank you for that yeah what
are your thoughts on this how far back
is rising now is that 15% gonna help ah
yeah I'll help tremendously I think well
it also depends largely on clock speed
so we didn't really mention that there
did we so assuming they can get we are
good decent clock speed gains up to
point five around there for sort of an
all core and the big one is latency
latency is really what sort of slows
rising down in in sort of high frame
rate gaming so if they can get a bit of
a clock speed bump improve memory
latency then a 15% IPC increase I would
say we're looking at beating the current
Intel CPUs pretty comfortably or pretty
instantly at least so I think if the
seconds and rise and CPUs that we have
now without changing frequency or
latency and just giving a 15 percent IPC
but we should IPC is a funny thing
because latency you know that does tie
into it I suppose it depends on the
application yeah it's all part of you
know your IPC performance but yeah I
think it's safe to say if they can pull
a 15 percent gain off regardless then
yeah they're gonna be at least on par
but you should end up with more cores
and things like that so yeah I think
then - should should be pretty good
you reckon that's fair I think that's
fair okay Steve any idea on the 1900 KF
9700 KF 9600 KF being able to pre-order
for months are they shipping it well if
you're asking me if I have any idea I
have no idea I don't have any idea if
they're sure I think they Intel
officially announced them or launched
them just in the last couple of weeks
they they there's been those rumors
about those CPS for a long time they're
winning here's our full ninth generation
list and those were on there so the F
range apart from the ninety four hundred
F and then many others out in the wild
because there was none no other models
that I came across when I was looking
yeah I think these are the new ones okay
the AF type ones and all that so yeah
not sure what's going on there but
haven't really looked into it so yeah I
guess we can't really give you a great
answer on that question so sorry about
that okay
comment from Soviet bird this was I
think fairly upvoted why don't we see
more true HDR monitors
aside from the two 4k 144 it's monitors
from a sous an Acer I'm not aware of any
other panels that me to the full
checklist for HDR I think it's a cool
feature but if manufacturers keep
trading HDL I could joke it may never be
mainstream so I I'm gonna hand that
entirely over to Tim I totally get where
you're coming from because it's very
frustrating to sort of see where HDL is
going in - I think it sort of comes in
to two points I guess the first one is
obviously a price because to add in the
main feature that you might have heard
me complain about a lot is with LCDs you
need a full array local dimming
backlight which means there's LEDs all
around behind the display so that you
can properly achieve the contrast that
hgr is really meant for and that's not a
cheap thing to add in most monitors that
have been built for years don't have
that included so - then suddenly have to
manufacture them at a monitor size and
add that onto the price of the monitor
that you you know and some of these
monitors for gaming are already over
$1000 without including that yeah you
start adding that in it makes it even
more expensive and I'm guessing for some
companies they think that's probably
putting it out of the price range that
you know a gamer would be willing to pay
I think the second reason comes down to
just the validation metrics that exist
they kind of allow these not true HCl
monitors to exist it's not just me
that's been complaining about you know
visas display HDR 400 certification I
saw this big thing on TFT central as
well which is another you know really
reputable monitor testing website where
they went into about how you know
basically it's just all load of crap
like you're never going to get a good
HDR experience from a moaner that's
certified with that but a company you
know is incentivized to have those logos
on the box because alone having a logo
that a certification on the Box sort of
says well you know we've made our
monitor to this standard so it must be
good enough so I think you know that is
kind of not helping the situation either
but I think you know as you know as I
start to educate people as you guys you
know watch this content and figure out
what is real what's not that'll
hopefully get a bit better once the sort
of reviews come out because this exact
same thing happened with TVs very early
on in TV HDR was all rubbish lots of TVs
said there were HDR capable when there
weren't and now you can buy really you
know good quality HD our TVs for good
prices so I think probably few years
away
it's hopefully we'll get there mm-hmm
random thought is the slow adoption of
quality HD our panels sort of down to
the lack of content so there's not a
huge amount so we've only got the to the
ASA and their sous monitors is it is the
lack of like really good game support
stopping people from getting really
excited about is it sort of a chicken
and egg situation so maybe these cheap
crappy HDR monitors are almost
beneficial in pushing the tech out even
though they're not really mine yet I
don't know that's just a random thought
I think I think more so than MIT games I
think you know have windows that's had a
lot of compatibility issues the HJ font
I think that has sort of slowed down too
because people used to plug in an HDMI
monitor turn on the switch in Windows
and it looks like garbage which kind of
you know slows people down it doesn't
really make you want to use that mode so
I think yeah that's definitely true but
I would say at the moment most games
these days is shipping with HDR support
so I think games these days are probably
a little bit ahead of where the monitors
are yeah which I think you know that
consoles are driving that so well you
need that first before you can write so
it's great it's getting better but
something to look out for okay another
question here if Intel gets to ten
nanometer it will easily beats or bait
AMD 7 nanometre even 5 millimeter what
about or what are your thoughts I
suppose that's what this person's asking
so is he insinuating the differing tale
gets a 10 a 10 nanometer they've
automatically one I thought was I think
it sounds like that is so saying as a
statement okay yeah I would have no I
wouldn't think that at all really but I
mean we have to see what's into is
capable of but Intel getting to 10 and a
10 nanometer will really be the first
step for them and I don't know if it's
an easy victory for them just getting
there I think they're gonna have a
serious fight on their hands which is
great for us yeah
yeah and it sounds from a lot of the
technical details that we've sort of
been able to get so far it sounds like
what Intel was trying to do with 10
animators is very close to what tsmc was
trying to do it seven animators so if
those two things are sort of equal you
want to say it will just necessarily
straight-up beat it it would be yeah and
it's a yes so it's quite a way away 10
nanometer for Intel yeah at least for a
desktop desktop mainstream part so
yeah AMD will be assuming this is n2
phase goes very well for them they'll be
moving on by them yeah so B could be
it's very interesting yeah certainly
interesting all right next question I
think this one was heavily outvoted and
it probably makes sense because it
should interest a few of you guys what
are the best under $50 gaming oriented
CPUs in the used market right now so
yeah what what a good secondhand sieve
used to buy for less than $50
essentially that's a tough one actually
I just did a quick bit of research it
seems you're unlikely to get even a
Sandy Bridge like core i7 2670 wouldn't
worry old yeah it's very old well
they're definitely all selling for $50
u.s. on eBay for completed listings even
something like the core i5
3570 case that's an Ivy Bridge just a
quad core you know hyper threading or
anything like that they're selling for
around 50 to $60 most of them were $60
plus so even getting one of them for $50
is hard let alone less than $50
so yeah in my opinion the used markets
kind of desperate right now it's not
really great for the most part because
people can ask those prices for those
CPUs because people who have an older
Sandy Bridge Ivybridge house well system
for them to buy an $80 core i7 or
whatever that's cheaper than building a
whole new system for three four five
hundred dollars u.s. so that's why
they've sort of held their value quite
well but for people who are looking at
just building a new system or buying a
new system unless you can you know find
one of those full complete systems for
$100 or less it's not really worth it
I did see some rise in 3 1200 s again
they're just quad cos they've definitely
know better than the has well parts but
they are selling for around $50 and wild
gravitate towards them is for the
upgrade path so if you can snag one of
them 50 bucks maybe it yourself a
secondhand B 350 maybe even a bought B
450 not that it really matters which one
you get but if you've got a cheap be 350
bought for around $50 as well then you
can upgrade to as in to maybe a 6 core
12 thread processor whatever whatever
comes out and
next few months but yeah and then you've
got the Xeon CPUs which yeah I mean for
the most part like at x58 Xeon or older
they're a bit of a bad joke in 2019 in
my opinion you've got security flaws
high power consumption old platforms
with shaky things like USB three support
the list as long as your arm of
drawbacks with them but if you can get a
whole complete system for $50 or less
which is yeah unlikely but it does
happen I think I paid about a hundred
and fifty for my one which isn't great
but that's Australian so it's not us so
yeah that's the best I what I just paid
that because I wanted to do the video so
I looked around for a month and that was
the best deal I came across an eBay so
anyway there aren't too many great cpu
purchases there for under $50 because
quad cores now you know they make do if
you playing fortnight or something but
they struggle in more modern tiles I
think again call a bit wet he bought I
think it was a thirty five seventy
something like that it was a I think was
an Ivy Bridge quad-core and it was
struggling in Tomb Raider and stuff like
that so and then the dual cores you
completely forget about their um yeah I
mean if you're really desperate sure but
yeah I'd be looking at trying to get on
the am for platform personally anything
adds that team that's good summary good
job cool
moving on Tim will enjoy this question
why do so many tech channels like to
clickbait false info for these so called
leaks that they get from sources and
we're not talking about guys that
actually do a really good critical
analysis or anything like that like I
know Jim from adored TV comes to my not
talking about those kind of guys at all
yeah it's the channels that someone will
say something on a forum and then all of
a sudden we've got Navi incoming
headline I think that's what this
comment I agree and YouTube is just
littered with those but they get views
they get really good views way better
views than what we get and it's really
easy to make content and there's not
really much pushback not a whole lot of
backlash like if you continually any
views pretty good like to dislike ratios
then yeah it's hard to knock them if all
they want to do is build a tech channel
certainly not what we're interested in
doing in but I think the answer to that
question is views you know if a we did a
video with Navi in the title it's
guaranteed good views so that's why they
do it okay next question
I'll read this out to give Timmy's voice
as much of a break as we can
hey Steve I'm not really into computers
but my niece dropped an old PC at my
house the other week it's pretty old I
think it's got eight Giga RAM Intel
Haswell Pentiums that's a dual-core five
hundred power supply GT 740 video card a
soos H what is it 81 and motherboard
just wondering what I could do to play
the latest games at quality frame rates
it's pretty old
that's a tough one that is a tough one
well your CPUs pretty well useless we
talked about this in an earlier comment
the dual cores are pretty well dead for
any sort of basic games I mean you can
play all the games that are still fun
but if you want to get into newer games
at quality frame rates which I imagine
is 60 FPS Plus then yeah not a lot you
can do with that one unfortunately again
Lee has well you'd be limited to locked
but you could buy a K processor but you
couldn't have a clock on that board
which would be fine anyway but you're
looking at probably $80 for a good sort
of core i7 processor don't know if it's
worth it eight gig of ram you really
need 16 for good smooth frame rates
that's the least your worries here
though and then the GT 740 you like you
know you can get a Radeon rx 570 or
something maybe even one of them
secondhand 480 dollars but you're
looking at spending 160 roles in that
system whereas you could probably build
what a new system for just the box
around 300 u.s. 400 at most so you're
kind of getting halfway to a new system
anyway and it's not going to be nearly
as good yeah and this person kind of in
a situation where there's too many key
components that are outdated so you're
sort of looking more your full upgrade
than just being able to piece together
something yeah few years ago before rise
and sort of came along in games started
to scale quite well across many threads
then I would have said I just sticker
has well Core i5 in it and maybe get a
secondhand graphics
50 dollars and you can probably hundred
dollars you'd get out of trouble but
yeah it'd almost be wasting money at
this point because it would it it
improves the gaming experience but yeah
depends what you wanna play if it's just
for tonight then yeah you could probably
put a graphics card in there and you'd
be away at reasonable quality settings
but yeah otherwise I'd probably just
save up and build a new system and
hopefully later in the about a year
something a lot better for around three
four hundred dollars u.s. alright we'll
move on to the next one how did you guys
start your channel was Nvidia and other
companies supporting you from the
beginning how did you feel when you got
your first 50k subscribers okay well we
start with the first one how did you
guys start the channel so Tim didn't
start the channel but we consulted him
quite heavily when starting the channel
actually because Tim was already making
YouTube videos for techspot yeah a
little bit of that so Tim already had a
bit of an understanding about how to set
the camera up the video audio all that
kind of stuff so yeah I spent quite a
bit sort of getting in Tim's ear picking
his brain about how to do YouTube but
the reason the well how the channel
started was a good friend of mine Matt
he had a bit of free time I had a lot of
PC hardware he was sort of he was
wanting to get in YouTube try a video
and it really interests him he liked
watching a lot of YouTube I didn't
actually watch much YouTube at all back
then which is hard to believe now all I
do is watch YouTube that's so big now
yeah I never really watched TV or movies
or anything anymore it's all YouTube but
yeah he really he wanted me to do it
he's like oh you should start a YouTube
channel instead of just writing stead of
just doing tech articles you know you
should do a channel owner was not
interested all couldn't at the time I
thought I couldn't imagine anything
worse like I just don't want to do it
and then he said well what if I get in
front of the camera and that way you
helped me and we were gonna do unboxing
videos they were super boring so we did
like one of those then we thought we'll
do my textbook articles in video format
and that's how the channel sort of
progressed then we got to about 40,000
subscribers and Matt realized it wasn't
really for him what this stuff it always
seems like it's a lot of fun it's just
you know guys like I
you know look at your set I wish I could
have a lot hardware it's just you've got
the dream job and for me it is but
you've got to be prepared to put in an
insane amount of hours to make the
content and obviously Tim's willing to
do that and yes around 40k subscribers
Matt left and then it was do we let the
channel die or what and then I thought
well I'll just I didn't really want to
jump in front of the camera yeah I
couldn't really imagine myself doing it
but I really enjoyed making the videos I
really loved what the channel had become
so I didn't want to see it die so I
jumped in front of the camera and it
went pretty well you guys were pretty
easy on me and yeah it's been a lot of
fun since and then Tim finished his
engineering degree he was looking at
going and doing yeah engineering work
but he loves doing this as well so he he
wanted to sort of partner with me and
continue the channel so I don't know how
many subscribers we had when you joined
it was below a hundred I thought yeah so
yeah we've done pretty well since then
so that's sort of how the channel
started Nvidia and other companies
supporting us from the beginning know
well it's because I was already getting
all the information and hardware and
stuff for text spot we were just reusing
that a lot for harbor unboxed but before
long all these companies were
approaching us sort of wanting to be
more involved with the channel directly
and I just went from there really
starting your own tech channel you don't
need contacts you don't need companies
you don't need anything you just need
Drive you just need to better work hard
for the first two years I made no money
on this channel it cost me money it was
a really hard because I just had my
first kids so me and my wife was
struggling a fair bit but I really
wanted to make this work because I
enjoyed it and I saw a future in it but
you've just got to be willing to stick
it out like two years you got to throw
out it with making no money and you've
got to work on it every second you get
so it's pretty tough but if you enjoy it
then yeah you just got to go for it so
you don't need companies or whatever
review the parts in your system review
your mates hardware do tech articles do
whatever you mean you don't need a lot
of the stuff to do interesting content
so you just got to be passionate about
it and get into it I'll try and wrap
this question up quickly and I've been
going on for a bit and then how you feel
when your first 50k subscribers I mean
50k was just another number for me 5k
was just mind-blowing 10k was
mind-blowing 15 20 everywhere you know
working towards 400,000 this year which
is just I see the number and I'm like I
don't know what to make of it it's
really weird yeah I think you'll need
I've found that I don't really
appreciate the number until I sort of
talk to other people about like I hear
you know I work on a YouTube channel
it's got you know three hundred and
fifty thousand subscribers are there
about and they're like three hundred and
fifty thousand that's a massive number
and it's so like oh yeah yeah it's it's
weird because you see other guys like
Linus even J bit with Paul those guys
have been doing it for longer and
they're doing a great job they have tons
and tons of subscribers we're just a
little fish in a big pond but yeah you
can't go comparing yourself to other
people just do your own thing and yeah
we're growing we're enjoying it so
doesn't really matter where we'd be at
it's just as long as it's growing and
going in the right direction you having
fun doing it yeah it's for me the the
50k thing was mind-blowing but every
single time we get to sort of one of
those things that can be considered
milestones it's just amazing yep so all
right now the graphics card related
question this looks like I have a gtx
1050 should upgrade to the 1650 or rx
570 in my rage and it's like $30 cheaper
I have a 550 watt power supply it's
bronze rated so I my interpretation of
that question is he saying rx 570s $30
cheaper yeah probably which would be
right because there are about 120 150 I
assume probably us-based not sure any
way out of that comparison yet just look
at my day on a review oh no it was my
day 1.5 for review we get the RX 570 is
the obvious choice there because I
believe for you it's 30 dollars cheaper
which should be correct and it's faster
and you've got a farmer 50 watt power
supply do you care about power
consumption that much you know even if
you're playing paying a lot of for power
like we are if you're playing for I and
I think it's 70 hours a week or
something it's $10 a that's retinol and
that's Australian
ten dollars Australian slots that like
six or something six dollars people I
think with
our the power sort of how much usage it
is what does it cost its it come it's
almost negligible I mean like it is ten
dollars over an entire year when you're
talking about GPUs that a difference the
difference in price is a lot larger than
that and you have to game a lot too -
yeah numbers look if they were identical
in terms of performance I would always
say just get the 1650 but you're looking
at 20-30 percent performance gains in
some games that doesn't go unnoticed
that's significant yeah that's like a
whole tier about when you're getting
performance gains that big so I would go
the RX 570 every time it just seems like
an obvious choice to me
yeah not much want to sound that one oh
boy you're right yeah well let you die
because this comments a beauty d12
studio and I normally really wouldn't
address this kind of question but it was
heavily uploaded so we'll just include I
think I know what Tim and I Barry's
going to say but here we go
will Navi be another AMD train wreck or
a genuine threat to in videos throne
well first of all I mean AMD train
wrecks a bit harsh I know I've been
harsh myself on Vader in the Radeon
seven but they're not that bad like
there's only one alternative and it's
not like it's yeah anyway I won't get
into that I don't we don't know what now
he's going to be like I mean we're just
guessing until I get it bench market and
at least a dozen games then we don't
know until we know the price performance
it's anyone's guess ok so I think we'll
wrap up part 1 of this month April
April's Q&amp;amp;A and yet we'll have part two
on the channel probably tomorrow but
yeah there's a lot of questions to get
through so rather make it one big long
one you guys you guys know what we do so
we split it into about 20 25 minute
episodes hey thank you everyone who
asked questions hopefully we answered
your question this one if not you may
get a second chance tomorrow and I think
we've got a separate patreon straight
question answering session as well
anyway I'm your host Steve I'm your host
Tim you're just the other guy yeah you
know knows who I am
that's fine with me subscribe like do
all that stuff and we'll see you again
