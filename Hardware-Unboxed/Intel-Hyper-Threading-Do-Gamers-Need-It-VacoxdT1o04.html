a look at hyper-threading performance
namely how it impacts games now the
focus will be on the core i7 range I
don't think there's much of a debate
whether or not hyper 3 is useful on a
core i3 processor as it most certainly
is as many of you guys are probably well
aware the desktop core i7s that is to
say sort of the mainstream core i7s are
quad core processors so like the core i5
processors they have 4 physical cores
each with their own independent level 2
cache yeah assad's issei cache not cache
so no need to point that out a thousand
times in the comments we get it anyway
the difference between the Core i5 and
core i7 processors is the addition of
hyper threading support the level 3
cache is also slightly larger but for
gaming this usually doesn't have much of
an impact so briefly what is hyper
threading essentially hyper threading is
a technology developed by Intel that
allows a single core to act like two
separate cores with hyper-threading a
single core can execute two rather than
one instructions from the operating
system this boosts efficiency and
reduces that delay between executions in
the past that's been discovered that
under certain circumstances hyper
threading could actually slightly reduce
gaming performance the reason for this
being that most games don't use more
than one or two cores and even those
that used up to four still couldn't take
advantage of hyper threading the problem
here being with hyper threading enabled
the physical cores were at risk of being
overworked while other physical cores
weren't being used at all the operating
system was meant to do a better job of
balancing low between physical and
virtual cores but this wasn't always the
case
anyway fast-forward to today and we're
starting to find games that are indeed
using more cores or threads
even so we've been recommending gamers
stick with the core i5 range for now as
it's rare that Core i7 processors will
deliver noticeably better performance
more and more you guys are starting a
challenges saying that you've indeed
seen performance gains when upgrading
your core i7 processor we mostly believe
this to be a placebo effect though
recently we have seen a few games really
pushing our core i7 6700k test machine
quite hard so we've decided to
investigate further
the reason gamers worry about their CPU
so much is because
I don't want to limit their gpus
performance in games the first reaction
when seeing frame dips or any kind of
performance drop off is to blame the cpu
and well sometimes it might be the
culprit so we will be using the skylake
core i7 6700k processor with a range of
new really released titles mostly 2016
titles and will be obviously testing
with hyper-threading enabled and
disabled for extreme sort of performance
or extreme use case I'll be using the
Titan XP doesn't really get much faster
than one of those suckers and for
realistic mid-range performance I think
probably the gtx 1070 makes the most
sense and then for a good sort of
mid-range performance the gtx 1060 so
that all sort of make up the three cards
will be using for testing we will be
using the relatively low 1080p
resolution which i know is a bit
unrealistic for the 1070 in particular
and the titan XP not so much the 1060
but we've done this to remove the cpu as
the limiting factor or bottleneck as
it's commonly referred to so with that
let's jump to the benchmarks first up we
have f1 2016 a racing simulator not
really known for its heavy demand on the
CPU that said the built-in benchmark at
our core i7 6700k with hyper-threading
enabled constantly loaded between 50 and
80% using the Titan XP we see that
hyper-threading boosted the average
framerate by 11% and the minimums by 15%
not a huge jump in performance but a
noteworthy increase nonetheless what was
interesting he however was as soon as we
downgrade the GPU to the gtx 1070 there
is zero difference having
hyper-threading enabled and disabled
this was also true when using the GTX
1060 whenever we do a gaming performance
type comparison that focuses on CPU
performance cities skylines always comes
up that's setting our test using a large
fully developed city with lots going on
the CPU utilization only sat at around
30 to 40 percent on the core i7 6700k as
a result disabling hyper-threading had
almost no impact on performance
certainly not a noticeable impact anyway
using our BOTS benchmark we have found
overwatch to be very CPU demanding and
the game seems to eat up all available
threads as such utilization never dipped
below if you
percent and was often found hovering
around 70% and at times even exceeded
90% this enabled hyper-threading to
deliver a 24 percent greater frame rate
when using the Titan XP a very
noteworthy gain indeed however once we
step down to the gtx 1070 those gains
completely evaporated and now the 6700k
can be seen delivering much the same
performance with hyper-threading
disabled cpu utilization wasn't very
high in total war Warhammer and with all
eight threads available as 6700k was
never taxed by more than about 40% this
meant even when using the Titan XP
disabling hyper threading had almost no
negative impact on performance
civilization is another game that always
comes up when testing CPU performance
though this latest version only pushed
the 6700 cade to around 55 to 70 percent
utilization as a result hyper threading
offered a very small performance
advantage when using the Titan XP and
gtx 1070 while performance remained much
the same with the gtx 1060 Gears of War
4 is a serious CPU hog and it's one of
those games that spark the creation of
this video the 6700 K with hyper
threading enabled was utilized by as
much as 95% and for the most part it's
Saturday around 70% in this test as a
result the minimum frame rate was 38%
higher with hyper threading enabled when
using the Titan XP the minimum frame
rate was also 14% greater with hyper
threading enabled when using the gtx
1070 however by the time we filtered
down to the gtx 1060 we find hyper
threading had a little to offer finally
we have battlefield one another heavy
cpu user for our test utilization
hovered between 60 and 80% they'll
occasionally did exceed 90% though only
very briefly enabling hyper threading
boosted the minimum frame rate when
using the Titan XP by 8% so not a huge
gain meanwhile no real gains were seen
with the gtx 1070 or 1060 graphics cards
right so six of the seven games tested
our popular triple-a titles released
this year so 2016 based on the sample of
games that we did test it doesn't really
look like much has changed so at this
point some of you guys may have noticed
them even be a bit disappointed that we
didn't include a Core i5 processor in
this comparison we genuinely want to
avoid complicating things with a core i5
core i7 comparison as this is primarily
a look at hyper-threading on the core i7
processors that said you can safely
assume that when match o'clock four
o'clock with the core i7 processor
something like the 6600 K will deliver
pretty much what we saw with
hyper-threading disabled myself and many
others have said for years now that
gamers really do reach a point of
diminishing returns with Core i7
processors for example the 6700 K cost a
bit over 40% more than the 6600 K and
even with the Titan XP handling the
rendering we didn't see those kinds of
gains for these reasons this is why we
recommended the 6600 K is the best value
CPU for gamers back in our September
video and this is why we also use the
6600 K for our $1200 1440p build so then
unless you're shooting for absolutely
maximum performance with high refresh
rate monitors and insane GPU
configurations I really don't think a
core i7 processors warranted at least
over a core i5 will this change in the
future yes eventually it will but I
don't think that changes anytime soon we
know that for the next generation
Intel's doing much the same they're
peddling their quad cores just as they
have for their sort of mainstream
high-end options so I don't think the
changes around the corner with that I
think I'll hand it over to you guys let
me know what you think in the comments
below is the core i7 worth getting or do
you agree with me and think the core i5
is more than sufficient for the most
part and if you think this video is
useful consider giving it a big old
thumbs up I'm your host Steve stay
classy
