blowing up with news and videos geforce
gtx 1080 and gtx 1070 breaking
unfortunately I don't have a 1080 yet
and like many of you will have to wait
until the 27th of this month to purchase
one it's expected that those who
attended the press event last week in
the US will be publishing their testing
results next week so for now those
interested in purchasing a 1080 later
this month only having videos marketing
material to go by while there is plenty
of good info there some of them might be
a bit misleading before getting into
that let's look at the official specs of
the 1080 surprisingly at its heart there
are just 2560 cuda cores which is
seventeen percent less than the titan x
and nine percent less than the 980 TI it
is however twenty-five percent more than
the gtx 980 making up for a lack of
course in the 1080 is the incredible
frequency at which these cores operate
when compared to the titan axon 980 TI
the 1080 runs its cause at least 61
percent faster with a base clock speed
of sixteen hundred and seven megahertz
the 1080 can boost as high as 17 33
megahertz and that's again 61 percent
higher than the previous flagship cards
so with each core running around sixty
percent faster you quickly begin to
understand how the 1080 overcomes having
seventeen percent fewer cause than the
type NEX next we have the power
efficiency this is an area where we're
always expecting big things it's been
four years now the GPU technology has
been stuck on the 28 nanometer process
with maxwell pushing that process to its
limits with the titan x a reduction in
die size down to 16 nanometers combined
with less complex GPU design was always
going to result in massive power savings
I say less complex but it is worth
noting that the transistor count stands
at 7.2 billion which is ten percent less
than the Titan X with thirty eight
percent more than the standard GTX 980
the move to the 1600-meter FinFET
process allows for the use of smaller
faster transistors that can be packed
together more densely more densely
indeed is the 1080 die size is just 294
millimeters squared that's the same
surface area is the gk104 die first used
by the gtx 680 a GPU which house does
3.5 billion transistors less than half
of that of the 10
d that really is impressive and it also
means that the 1080 dies around half the
size of the one featured on the tight
next and the 980 TI although I don't
know exactly how the 1080 will stack up
against the existing max well we know
that nad has been given a 180 watt TDP
rating and a single 8pm power connector
so we don't need to speculate too much
here it's going to be highly efficient
the next big thing to consider is the
memory performance which has jump from 7
gigabits per second of the high-end
Maxwell cards to 10 gigabits per second
for the 1080 in video has achieved this
forty three percent increase in memory
throughput by opening for the new gddr5
X memory although the memory is faster
the 384-bit memory bus of the titan next
980 TI has been downgraded to the same
256-bit bus used by the 980 this means
that although the memory is operating
considerably faster the 1080 is still
limited to a 320 gigabyte per second
memory bandwidth so while we do see a
forty-three percent increase in
bandwidth over the 980 the 1080 sees
five percent less bandwidth in the Titan
X and gtx 980 TI given its expected
performance we can assume the 1080 is
still going to be a bit star from memory
bandwidth even with the gddr5 x memory
with those key specifications in mind
let's move on in video release a slide
that caused a lot of stir and it showed
the 1080 to have twice the performance
of the Titan next while delivering three
times the efficiency the slide could be
a bit misleading however as it's
comparing relative vr gaming performance
and not typical gaming performance and
video has made advancements with pascal
over maxwell when it comes to be our
rendering with technologies such as
simultaneous multi projection so there
are bigger gains to be had here
therefore when it comes to traditional
gaming on a 4k panel for example we
don't expect the 1080 to deliver twice
the performance of the type next that
really would be something particularly
given the core specifications instead I
expected on average the 1080 will end up
being somewhere around twenty to
twenty-five percent faster than the
tight next which will make it a great
deal faster than in videos previous five
hundred fifty dollar offering the gtx
980 so the 1080 might not be as fast as
some would expect looking at in video
slide but even so at twenty percent
faster than the type next it's going to
be a real beast anyway last but
certainly not least there's the issue of
the price this is something we already
know for a fact the GTX 1080 will cost
600 us or will it
custom designed cards from board
partners such as they suit gigabyte an
msi for example have a suggested retail
price of six hundred dollars they should
arrive soon after the initial release on
the 27th however if you want to preorder
the gtx 1080 you'll have to pay a rather
hefty 100 dollar price premium for what
is now known as a founders edition card
there's been a great deal of confusion
surrounding the founders edition namely
to do with what it actually is in short
the founders edition is merely a
reference card you know those cards 99%
of you have tried to avoid in the past
well this time around and Vidya believes
their design will be the best and would
like to see it on sale for the life of
the product at the same time and video
doesn't want to compete directly with
board partners which is why partners can
sell their variants of the card for less
if your videos sold their version at the
same price as partners versions this
would significantly impact the sales of
partners and their relationship within
video nevertheless it seems as though
you'll only be able to purchase a
founders edition card upon release in
the 27th with Boyd partners restrained
from selling anything else in the short
term for me though next month's release
of the geforce gtx 1070 you will be the
one to watch the 1070 should deliver
strong performance at a much more
realistic price of three hundred and
eighty dollars I'm expecting the 1017 to
be a superb overclocker as well
particularly once and videos board
partners get their hands on it also
around the corner AMD's pilaris GPUs
which are expected to really heat up
competition in the mainstream market so
might pay to take a step back and wait
not only for in videos board partners to
release their cards but also to see
where AMD has in store for us thanks for
joining me for another episode of
hardware inbox if you have any questions
please leave them in the comments visit
our website at hardware and box com I'll
see you guys next time
