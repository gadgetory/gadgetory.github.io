making it possible for timur myself to
attend Computex 2019 please check out
their latest AMD x5 70 motherboards made
for gamers and creators by the link in
the video description also thank you to
Corsair for their support please check
all their exciting products out via the
link in the video description welcome
back to harbor unbox today we're at the
msi booth or at least the plan was to
film on location at the msi booth like
we did last year but just look at this
mess it seems words got out that there's
a lot of exciting new products on
display this year at the msi booth like
many we were keen to check out MSI's new
x5 70 range of motherboards msi hit it
out of the park with their b4 50 range
so we were hoping that would continue
with the x5 70 boards and so far things
do look very promising but before we
dive into the new boards I did quickly
quiz the msi product manager on the
status of their existing be 350 and X
370 motherboards and they will be
getting BIOS updates to supporters in
two processors this is a question that
many of you have been asking us over the
past few weeks leading up to Computex so
I'm glad we could get an official
response on day one msi also wanted to
say their current b4 15 X 470 product
lines will receive a max branding to the
end of the product name to signify
support falls into processes out of the
box so the updated version of the msi be
450 tomahawk for example that will now
be labeled as the msi be 450 tomahawk
max and this does make it a lot easier
for retailers and customers to know if
they're selling slash buying a board
that will work with us into processor
out of the box that's it all of MSI's be
450 boards do support BIOS flashback
which means you can update the board's
BIOS without the need for a CPU that's
supported by the currently installed
BIOS as for the older be 350 and X 370
motherboards I'll talk more about CPU
support towards the end of the video but
for now let's check out MSI as new x5 70
motherboards I'll start with what's
going to be unquestionably one of the
most expensive high and X 570
motherboards you're going to find
following in the footsteps of the mega X
399 creation we have the prestige so
they've dropped to the Meg acronym which
is kinda nice cuz I didn't really like
the whole Meg thing prestige sounds a
bit more prestige and I just sounds
better
so it doesn't really matter anyway
because we will be referring to this one
99% of the time as the x5 70 creation
and well that's just a much simpler name
and I think a lot of you guys prefer
that they just use creation on board you
get an IR digital vrm using 70 amp power
stages it's a 12 plus 4 plus 1
configuration so that's an overkill 12
phase vrm with an 840 amp capacity under
optimal conditions equally impressive is
the massive cooling you'll find on this
board there's no plastic IO covers this
time around which I personally much
prefer rather the primary aluminium heat
sink covers the backside of the i/o
ports giving the board a clean look
while also being highly functional the
list of features for all of these boards
really is almost too long to cover but
the highlights include things such as a
dedicated PCIe expander card supporting
an additional 2 nvme SSDs there's also
10 Gigabit LAN along with Wi-Fi six
boatloads of USB ports and I'm not even
joking about that one I think this one
has the most connectivity of any x5 70
motherboard out there in total there's
11 USB 3.1 gen2 type-c ports a single
USB 3.1 gen2 type-c port and then
there's two USB ports which I guess you
can use with your peripherals you'll
notice this board also features active
cooling over the x5 70 chipset basically
it'll only become active during heavy
and VMI's storage access though we will
have to verify this weather or in
testing when we get the board in a month
or so msi didn't show us that the fans
are virtually silent and they are of the
highest quality they noted that while
their competitors are using sleeved fans
they're using ball bearing fans rated
for at least 2000 hours of operation but
because they are using the same zero
froze a technology that you'll get with
their latest graphics cards the fans
won't be active until the chipset
reaches a certain temperature MSI also
informed us that all the x5 70
motherboards will use international
rectifier or IR vrm components and even
the most basic boards such as the MP GX
570 gaming plus will still pack a six
phase V core verum with large heat sinks
they also claimed that all X 570 boards
will feature server grade PCBs with the
entry-level options such as the gaming
plus built in a four
lair PCB while the higher-end models
will get six and even eight layer PCBs
all that we found six new MSI x5 70
motherboards on display and this
included the prestige x5 70 Croatian
that we've already looked at there was
also the x5 70 God like pretty insane
overkill bought that one
there's the x5 70 ace the x5 70 gaming
Pro carbon that one has too many words
in it what do I allow is it 2 2 2 2
words so they violated that with the
gaming pro cabin but whatever x5 70
gaming edge that one's that one's ok it
snuck in and the x5 70 game Plus that
one's also ok the x5 70 godlike is
another extreme overkill motherboard
that will only be available in limited
numbers so if you want to get what will
certainly be one of the maddest x5 70
motherboards on the market you'll need
to act fast
the real flagship motherboard at least
what I consider to be their real
flagship motherboard will be the ACE and
this isn't a limited run deal again we
don't know the pricing yet but I expect
to pay around $300 design-wise it is
very similar to the godlike and the
feature set is still extremely
impressive for example you do get a 12
phase V core vr m 3 m dot 2 ports with
cooling 2.5 Gigabit LAN y56 and then all
the standard stuff that we've already
talked about for me though I feel like
the x5 70 gaming edge Wi-Fi is the real
standout this is meant to be a more
affordable motherboard and yet the
designer and feature set was really
quite incredible so I'm very keen to see
what this board goes on sale for the Zed
390 edge for example that's $190
motherboard but if the x5 70 edges
anywhere near $200 going to be a
seriously good buy so be sure to keep an
eye on this one
something else that caught my eye at the
MSI booth was this thing not the x5 70
got like a motherboard well that's also
very cool but I mean this case the Meg
alchemy 700 X this thing looked
absolutely awesome but unfortunately
it's just a prototype and it sounds like
MSI has no intention of putting it into
mass production they claim it's the
world's first curved gaming case which I
don't really challenge apart from the
fact that they are actually gonna sell
them
anyway from behind it looks like some
kind of strange really big monitor it's
actually pretty sleek looking though and
it wasn't until I saw the motherboards
IO with all the cables hanging out of it
that I realized that it was actually
some kind of PC case around the front
this is how it looked with the x5 70 got
like installed pretty awesome case and I
have to say though it did remind me very
much of the Thermaltake Korpi series
this in my opinion looked much cleaner
though this is coming from a big core
Petrie fan anyway maybe spam hashtag
build the alchemy in the comment section
below and then I'll continue to pressure
msi into making this case a reality as
for graphics cards were obviously still
a bit off from getting navi but i did
hear that there will most likely be some
custom-designed navi graphics cards from
AI B's which I suppose didn't really
surprise me because we have that for the
rx 585 70 and so on but still it is good
to hear that it won't be like what
happened with Vega and Radeon 7 and then
in the absence of any new GPUs EMS I did
have a 10-year anniversary edition of
their lightening series obviously based
on the new RT X 2082 I this is a neutral
themed graphics card and you will be
able to buy this soon and apparently it
makes use of super high quality superb
in silicon so it should guarantee super
strong overclocks
anyway that's what MSI told me it's a
nice looking car but I'm not sure we'll
get the chance to check that on the
channel oh and something else that's
kind of unrelated to this video but we
heard this information elsewhere is that
it sounds like and we heard this from a
few different sources that the x5 70
motherboards or rather the Zen drew
processors will work quite happily up to
ddr4 4000 or at least people were
suggesting that that memory speed is
very easy to achieve with the Zen 2
processor so again this is just people
talking on the showroom floor we don't
we weren't shown any evidence and of
course we haven't been able to test them
for ourselves so take this with a grain
of salt but it sounds like from what
we're hearing Zen to will work at ddr4
4,000 very comfortably and depending on
the quality of the motherboard higher
speeds like up to 4600 around there I
don't know take that with a grain of
salt it seems pretty incredible based on
what we've seen from first and
second generalizing but it certainly
sounds like third-gen risin will see a
massive improvement in memory support
and then the frequencies that it can run
at still we will be getting into all
those X 570 boards in due time so that's
gonna be a whole lot of fun I'm also
kinda dig out my B 350 and X 370 boards
to see how they go with the new Verizon
3000 series processors and I said
earlier all the MSI 300 series boards
will be receiving a BIOS update to
support those n 2 processors so yeah
that's great news for those of you who
picked up a be 350 motherboard a few
years ago and yeah this is exactly the
news I was expecting here I was aim B
promised that the am 4 boards would be
compatible at least till 2020 so yeah no
huge surprises there but it's good to
get an official response anyway quite a
few of you have also asked me if your
base model be 350 motherboard will be
able to handle as into processor even if
it gets BIOS support which we've just
confirmed that it will be getting and in
short the answer is yes horizon 930 900
X that's only a 105 watt TDP part so
yeah any boards that support the horizon
720 700 X will be able to support the
3900 X without an issue
I feel like Tim is doing his absolute
best throwing me off my game here it's
not working Tim anyway what was I
talking about yes so CPU support I
suspect to those of you with an older
entry level be 350 board you're probably
not looking at buying a $500 u.s. CPU
anyway because those boards weren't
particularly expensive I think they were
around $100 even a couple of years ago
so something like the rise in 5 3600 or
perhaps even the rise in 730 700 X
they'll be more likely what you're
looking at and both of those are 65 watt
parts so you really have nothing to
worry about there anyway that is going
to do it for this video hope you guys
enjoyed our look at MSI's upcoming x5 70
motherboards I hope you enjoyed Tim
being a goofball and the background
there
can't wait out of this video and see
what he was up to but he was making
plenty of noise hey I make sure you stay
tuned for more complex coverage from Tim
and myself and always thank you for
watching I'm your host Steve I'll see
you
again next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
