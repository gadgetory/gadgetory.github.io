video is a follow-up to that heavily
requested second-generation rise an IPC
comparison though we made a few weeks
ago when I compared the horizon 5 2600 X
to the core i7 80s 700 K now these are 6
core 12 thread CPUs and for that test
they were locked at 4 gigahertz so it's
more of a for science type test and that
it is your typical a sort of buying
advise and the idea there is to remove
the core and memory clock speeds from
the equation to see how the different
architectures stack up before we get to
that though this video has been

Harbor unboxed to get started okay so
for those of you unaware IP C stands for
instructions per cycle and it is a good
indicator of a CPUs performance the
coffee-like cpus offer high IPC coupled
with high operating frequency and that
really is the best combination for
maximum performance although AMD's
clearly trailing when it comes to
frequency we saw in the last video that
they have really closed up on Intel when
it comes to IPC performance however not
all Intel CPUs are created equally and
their high-end desktop parts using the
sky like X architecture are very
different to the coffee-like core i7
processor that was featured in the
previous video that being the case many
of you have asked me to go back and
recreate the IPC comparison but this
time with ace
like X processor included so that's what
I've done once again to see how much
headway AMD's made here we're going to
neutralize as many variables as we can
while also keeping things as realistic
as possible the first and most obvious
step is to remove the core frequency
from the equation and to do so we've
locked all CPU cores at 4 gigahertz any
type of boost technology has also been
disabled the cause cannot go past 4
gigahertz and all course are locked at 4
gigahertz the second generation rise in
CPUs have been tested on the asrock x4
70 Taichi ultimate and the coffee-like
CPUs on the edge rocks at 370 Taichi
both configurations use the same g.skill
flex ddr4 3,200 memory using the extreme
memory profile and the same MSI GTX 10
ADC a gaming extra was used for all test
systems and finally for those of you
wondering no I haven't fine-tuned the
horizons sub memory timings for this
test I feel like that would have been a
bit misleading perhaps that's something
we can do in another video also please
note and I can't stress this enough this
is purely for a science type benchmark
and is in no way buying advice the Intel
CPUs do have a clock speed advantage
there's no getting away from that and
the real-world performance please refer
to our recent rise in 5 2,600 2,600 X
and 2,700 X reviews for this test I've
included results for the Intel Core i7
87 ok 78 20x and 7800 X along with the
risin 7 2,700 X 2600 X 1800 X and 1600 X
now the 1600 X 2600 X 7800 X and 8700 K
all have the same CPU resources so
there's 6 core with 12 threads the 1800
X 2,700 X and 7800 X that's a lot of X's
all have an advantage being that they
are eight core 16 thread CPUs so they
will be compared to one another having
said all that let's jump into the
results first up we have sustained
memory bandwidth performance and here we
see that despite using the same G school
flare X ddr4 3,200 memory the
performance does vary quite a bit from
one platform to another
although the core i7 87 under K and rise
in processors feature dual channel
memory controllers the rise and cpus do
enjoy almost a 20
sent boost in memory bandwidth however
the sky like X core i7 7800 X and 78 20x
take advantage of quad channel memory
and as a result have at least 33% more
bandwidth to play with when compared to
the rise in CPUs moving on to the center
bench r15 results and here we see that
despite offering a greatest single
thread score the core i7 78 20x was
actually slower than even the 1800 X for
the multi-threaded result and this
points to AMD's implementation of SMT as
being more efficient than the HT
technology used by Intel in this clock
for clock comparison the 2700 X again
outscored the 78 20x by 6 percent margin
it was a similar story when looking at
these six core CPUs here the 7800 X
match the single thread performance of
the 8700 K but loses out for the
multi-threaded test then while it beat
the rise in cpus by a sizable margin for
the single thread test it was 6% slower
than the 2600 X for the multi-threaded
test next up we have the PC mark of
video editing results and here the 8
core CPUs all delivered similar results
when matched clock for clock the 78 20x
did just manage to edge out the 2700 X
but we're really talking about margin of
error stuff here the same is also true
for the 6 core CPU comparison though
here the 1600 X does lag a bit behind
interestingly the rice and CPUs do
extremely well in a PC mark 10 gaming
physics test and a pieces though SMT
technology is being very well utilized
here the 2700 X was 6% fast and the 78
20x while the 2600 X was 9% faster than
the 7800 X 7-zip is an interesting
program to benchmark IPC performance
with as the use of simultaneous
multi-threading behaves differently on
the intel and AMD cpus intel's hyper
threading appears to be just as
efficient for compression work as it is
decompression and this gives them an
advantage for the compression test
AMD's SMT technology on the other hand
is amazing at decompression but quite
poor compression that said though since
most people extract archives far more
often than create them this is a decent
performance trade-off however as I
alluded to earlier what it does do is
make comparing IPC performance very
difficult I really wish I had taken the
time to run this test again with
simultaneous multi-threading disabled on
both the AMD
Intel CPUs I think those results would
have been quite interesting here we see
when testing with Excel that the eight
core isin CPUs are I would have beat the
78 20x and complete the workload six
percent faster meanwhile the 2600 X was
five percent faster than the 7800 X and
even the old 1600 X was still a fraction
quicker we've seen in the past that I a
hand brake workload prefers Intel CPUs
and as a result these skylake X CPUs
were able to beat these second gen Rison
processors by a convincing margin in
this test the 7820 X for example was 11
percent faster than 2,700 X and the same
margin was seen when comparing the 700 X
and 2600 X then moving on we have the
corona benchmark and we see much more
competitive results here here the 2,700
X and 78 20x delivered these same
performance while the 2600 X was a
smidgen quicker than the 7800 X
performance was again competitive in
blender though this time the Intel CPUs
did have a slight performance advantage
we're talking just 5% or less here so
again only a very slight advantage when
matched clock for clock at 4 gigahertz
moving on to the v-ray benchmark and
here we see again very competitive
results basically identical performance
when comparing these skylake X and
second gen rise and processors alright
so let's move on to some gaming
benchmarks and here I expect to see some
more mixture results given what we've
seen in the past when testing scale like
X it has to be said though that Intel
does get off to a flying start with
ashes of the singularity delivering
strong performance with both their 6 and
8 core models as both were 10% faster
and the competing second generation
horizon parts moving on though we find
some interesting results with assassin's
creed origins using the ultra quality
preset although the 2,700 x edged ahead
of the 78 20x the 2600 x was a good bit
slower than the 7800 x introducing the
higher quality settings does reduce the
performance deficit between the six core
models and now we're seeing very similar
frame time performance
moving on to battlefield one and here we
have some very interesting results for
whatever reason the second gen Rison
processors and even the first generation
models had no trouble beating the sky
like X competition the 2,700 X was eight
percent faster than 78 20x for the
average frame rate and 12 percent for
the frame time result so seriously
strong showing for AMD
his title those margins grew further
once we reduced the GPU bottleneck with
the medium quality settings and here the
2700 X was 11% fast in the 78 20x for
the average frame rate and 13% faster
for the 1% low result finally I compared
these CPUs clock for clock in Far Cry 5
and again another big win for AMD here
despite using the ultra quality preset
at 1080p the 2,700 X was up to 11
percent faster than 78 20x and the 2600
X was up to 10% faster than these 7800 X
even the first gen parts were able to
match the sky like xcp use when match
clock for clock at full gigahertz ok so
in the previous IPC comparison which
focused on the coffee lake and second
generalize and processors I noted a few
reasons for why intel's mainstream cpu
series enjoys big gains in most of the
gaming titles in short i believe this is
down to the quarter core latency and
intel's ring bus is just extremely
efficient however the mesh interconnect
used by the sky like ex and modern Intel
Xeon server processes isn't nearly as
impressive at least with these lower
core count CPUs when it came to gaming
performance we saw very mixed results
though overall AMD came out on top for
the small sample of games tested of
course this is a 4 gigahertz clock for
clock comparison and the average 7800 X
should be good
4.6 gigahertz while the arisin 520 600 X
is more limited hitting around 4.2 4.3
here it's on all cause that's up to a 10
percent frequency advantage for the sky
like xcp under normal conditions so that
being the case it would be very
interesting to compare these two CPUs in
a wide range of games you know say more
than 30 games anyway getting back to IPC
performance it's quite clear the second
generalising cpus are at a disadvantage
when compared to the sky like X CPUs
even when it comes to games then of
course we have application performance
which was mighty competitive here it was
rare for a workload to heavily favor a
particular CPU architecture and overall
performance was very much the same this
then suggests that Amy's upcoming second
generation rise and thread Ripper CPUs
are going to give Intel a seriously hard
time at the high end if they weren't
already oh it's so good to have some
real competition back in the CPU space
and that is going to do it for this one
