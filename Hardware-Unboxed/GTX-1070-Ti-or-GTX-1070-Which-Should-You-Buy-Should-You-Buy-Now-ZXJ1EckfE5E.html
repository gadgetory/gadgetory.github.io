that long ago I looked at which was the
best value buy the new geforce gtx 1070
TI or the existing 1080i did this by
comparing to MSI gaming models at their
stock operating clock frequencies as
well as a custom overclock which
basically pushed both models as fast as
they would go in short I found that if
you don't plan to overclock both models
do offer a similar level of value but
for those of you that do plan to
overclock you will get the most bang for
your buck with the new 1070 TI this of
course is assuming that both models are
available at the MSRP $450 us for the
1070 TI on $500 us for the 1080 right
now the gtx 1070 i can be had for 450
dollars u.s. at both Newegg and amazon
while the 1080 is selling for 520
dollars at both locations pricing is yet
to settle down for the 1070 TI in
australia $680 it's not much cheaper
than the 1080 s which self around seven
hundred and twenty dollars so in the US
the 1072 eye looks to me by far the best
value option right now while fellow aziz
will probably still up for the gtx 1080
anyway today's video is about the
geforce gtx 1070 versus the 1070 TI i
didn't overclock the vanilla 1070 in the
previous video and this had many of you
questioning if overclocking that model
would in fact be the best value option
so today we're going to find out before
we do though I should just note that
buying a geforce 10 series graphics card
right now might not be the best movers
we're likely just months away from the
release of what will probably end up
being called the geforce 20 series i
will discuss there's a bit more at the
end of the video but for now let's talk
about these system specs and then we'll
get into the results for testing i've
once again used my core i7 87 eric a
test system clocked at 5 gigahertz with
32 gigabytes of ddr4 3000 memory the msi
geforce gtx 1070 gaming ex was used for
the testing and I've used other MSI
gaming models for comparison the 1070
gaming X operated at 1949 megahertz out
of the box with a memory speed of 8
point
1 gigabits per second overclocked I
managed to raise the turbo boost 3.0
frequency to 2076 megahertz which is
slightly higher than the 2050 megahertz
I was able to run the 1070 Ti at the
gddr5 memory frequency has also been
increased to two thousand three hundred
and fifty megahertz for a transfer rate
of nine point four gigabits per second
this means the overclocked 1070 1070 Ti
and the 1080 or roughly overclocked to
the same frequency that said whereas our
overclock did boost the ten eighties
operating frequency by 10% and the 1070
Ti by twelve percent the 1070 was only
boosted by seven percent so it will see
the smallest improvement of the three
GPUs tested as it was already quite
aggressively overclocked from factory
first up we have Assassin's Creed
origins and here overclocking the gtx
10:17 and it's just a few extra frames
for a very mild 5% performance boost
that said though we did see a decent 9%
increase for the 1% low result perhaps
the increased memory bandwidth helped
you anyway once overclocked to the max
that 1070 was still slower than the
stock 1070 TI by a decent margin in fact
the 1070 to I was 9% faster at stock
clock speeds and 21% faster once
overclocked so for overclock is the 1070
I was looking like the far more
attractive product here here we see
similar margins when testing with
destiny to the 1070 became 6% faster
once overclocked but even so with the
overclock it's still trailed the stock
1070 Ti by a 4% margin then once we have
a clock for 10 72 I that did become 14%
faster than the max day out 1070 again
the overclocked 1070 provided just 6%
more frames this time an f1 2017 this
minute was 6% slower than the 1070 TI
and 17% slower
once the TR model was overclocked
another 6% gain can be seen in project
cars - and overclocking the 1070 and
this took the average frame rate to 87
fps this means overclocked in the 1070 -
I produced 15% more performance as the
average frame rate hit 100 FPS
performance gains for the 1070 in quake
champions were minimal just a 5 percent
increase was
Sene because of this the overclocked GTX
1072 I was 23% faster though you should
keep in mind that it does pack 27% more
CUDA cores so this kind of margin is
certainly impossible
this time when testing with shadow of
war the 1070 was 7% faster once
overclocked and came within a frame of
the 1072 eye of course you can still
overclock for 1070 TI and once we do
this it does become 13% fastest so one
of the smaller wins for the 1072 eye but
a noteworthy margin all the same
basically we see similar margins to
those just seen when testing with shadow
of war this time with Total War
Warhammer 2 so there really isn't much
else that needs to be said here and
finally we have Wolfenstein 2 which
unsurprisingly shows similar margins to
the games previously tested so at this
point it's pretty clear how these two
GPUs compare out of the box and
overclocked the arrival of the geforce
gtx 1070 i didn't make the standard 1070
somewhat pointless least in my opinion
which is why didn't bother overclocking
in the previous comparison though i
suppose that was a bit of an oversight
as i had to create this video right now
the cheapest gtx 1070 on Amazon and
Newegg
is 410 dollars u.s. though most are
priced closer to four hundred and thirty
dollars US since the gtx 1070 TI can
easily be had for four hundred and fifty
dollars u.s. on both of the websites
just mentioned it's the obvious choice
again the margins in australia are a bit
out of whack with what we're seeing over
in the US a typical 1070 TI cost six
hundred eighty dollars australian while
a typical 1070 cost five hundred and
seventy dollars australian so while
australians are paying about 19% more
for the TI model americans are paying at
just five percent more according to the
MSRP that 1070 TI should cost twelve and
a half percent more so this means us
shoppers are actually overpaying for the
standard 1070 right now while australian
shoppers are overpaying for the 1070 TI
so in summary US shoppers should be
buying the 1072 i really no question
about that and for the aussie viewers
i'd probably wait till the 1072 eye
drops down to or below $650 australian
that said though should you even
consider buying and you
graphics card at all right now unless
you're getting an amazing sale price I
strongly recommend that you just wait at
this point I realize when it comes to PC
hardware there's always something better
just around the corner so you're always
tossing up between waiting or buying now
this late in the product cycle though
I'd suggest waiting the 1072 eye is an
attractive option for those buying a new
graphics card in time for Christmas I
guess that's one in videos banking on as
they try to flog their 18-month old
Pascal architecture one more time anyway
I hope that answers that one putting the
small issue of whether or not you should
buy a graphics card at all right now
just push that aside I think it's safe
to say the gtx 1070 TI seems like the
best choice in the 400 to 500 dollar
u.s. price range especially if you plan
to overclock as you can achieve GT X
1080 light performance while saving
enough money to purchase 4400 crystals
think of all that glorious loop I'm your
host Steve see you again next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
