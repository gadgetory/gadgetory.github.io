finally checking out Intel's new skylake
X CPUs for those of you unaware during
the Computex 2017 trade show which took
place earlier this month Intel announced
their upcoming core x-series comprising
of not three CPUs not four but rather
nine the biggest range of high-end
desktop processors intel has ever
announced so why is Intel gone from four
CPUs with Ford rally covering the six
eight and ten core variants to nine CPUs
covering anywhere from 4 to 18 cause the
answer is simple after years without
competition Intel finally had some and
some serious competition at that AMD
Verizon 7 and Rison 5 CPUs have already
mix things up quite a bit and put
Intel's more mainstream offerings under
fire AMD then put Intel on notice when
they announced the upcoming high-end
desktop series dubbed thread Ripper
which would offer up to a massive 16
core 32 thread part and it's expected to
cost considerably less than Intel's 10
called Broadway Lee CPU speaking of
Broadway Lee the sting from that series
is still fresh in my mind though 10 core
69 50 X came in at insane $1700 us well
the eight core sixty nine hundred K
wasn't much better at one thousand and
fifty dollars u.s. those seeking a
6-quart Intel CPU had to cough up at
least four hundred thirty dollars for
the 6800 K but in doing so sorry pretty
hefty downgrade in PCI Elaine's from 40
to just 28 as it stood AMD's rise in
seven series is making a mockery of
Broadway Lee so Intel needed to combat
the situation sooner rather than later
and with an even more serious threat on
the horizon they decided to act and rush
out skylake X the question being in a
world where the risin 7 1700 exists for
just 310 dollars can until get away
charging roughly twice that for their 8
core CPU this is exactly what they plan
to do with the core i7 78 20x higher up
the food chain we have the core I 9 7900
X the cheapest of the new core o 9 CPUs
at just $1000
it's the cheapest 10 core CPU we've ever
seen from Intel but is it cheap enough
then you six core
why 778 100x model has dropped down to a
slightly more affordable $390 us but
that still prices that well above the 8
core horizon 7 1700 Intel's also going
to release a pair of quad-core parts
based on the KB like X architecture in
what is an utterly baffling move those
parts will be the core i7 7740 X and the
core i5 7640 X for this review though I
won't be looking at these models we'll
save them for a future feature thus far
I've mentioned five of the nine new
Intel Core xep I use the other four
being me twelve fourteen sixteen and
eighteen core models though they won't
be available on June 26 rather Intel
suggests they will be released much
later in the year anyway for this video
I'm not going to go too heavily into the
details on the new processes all intel's
new architecture we've sort of already
gone over the specifications and
information released at competence and
since we are quite late to the party
here all this information has been
released by other sources so for now
we're focused on the lower core count
sky like X chips the core o 970 100x
core i7 78 20x and core i7 7800 X here
we can see how each of the three new CPU
is compared and apart from the core
count and of course price the key thing
to note here are the available PCIe
lanes for the full forty four lanes
consumers must invest no less than $1000
meanwhile the $600 and $390 parts offer
only 28 lanes the same amount as last
season 6800 K if we compare the core oh
nine 7100 X to the previous generation
ten core part it looks very impressive
you get the same core in thread count
while paying a little over 40% less you
also get a few more PCIe lanes and of
course upgraded CPU architecture then
when compared to 2014 flagship core i7
5960 X you get more cores and a higher
operating frequency for the same price
of course as I mentioned a lot has
changed in the last three months as a
result the CPU landscape looks very
different and with the arrival of AMD's
thread Ripper just around the corner
things are set to change even more as I
said thread Ripper will pack up to 16
cores and 32 threads and is expected to
cost no more than the core o 970 900 X
that's at official pricing information
is yet to be released what we do know is
a thread Ripper platform will offer an
incredible 64 PCIe lanes
while the CPUs will pack a mammoth 32
megabytes of level 3 cache although we
can't compare the new skylake X CPUs to
thread Ripper we can see how they
compare to amy's existing risin 7 and
risin 5 parts so let's do that
previously with Broadway Lee processes
such as the 69 50 X and 69 or ok we were
stuck at a memory speed of about 20 666
the skylake EX models happily accepted
the 3600 extreme memory profile of our
g.skill Triton's at our GB 32 gig memory
kit that said though we decided to test
at 3200 and we thought this was probably
a better memory speed until we test how
many memory modules XJ 99 motherboards
and Korac CPUs can hit this frequency
anyway running the memory at ddr4
through 200 resulted in a massive
bandwidth of 63 gigabytes per second for
the core o 9 7 100x
the 6 core 700 X also achieved roughly
60 gigabytes of throughput as well this
means 470 100x enjoyed around an 18%
boost in memory bandwidth compared to
the previous generation 10 core 69 50x
AMD's Rison 7-series
impressed in the Cinebench r15
multi-threaded test and as you can see
the 8 core CPU puts down the 69 50 X
with relative ease
in fact the 1800 X isn't a great deal
slower than the 10 core 69 50 X largely
thanks to greater operating frequencies
however the core i7 78 20 and its higher
clock speeds make up for this enable to
roughly match the 69 50 X while offering
almost a 20% boost over the 1600 K the
six core 7800 X also outscores the
horizon 5 1600 X and beats it
comfortably for the single thread test
as well then finally we have the Big
Daddy the core I nine 1700 X and it's
amazing score of two thousand 201 points
making it by far the most powerful
desktop CP we've ever tested the single
thread result is also very impressive
matching the 7700 K those wanting to
compress and decompress archives in a
hurry take notice because again of has
no desktop CPU as fast as the core I 9
1700 X at least at the moment the 70 100
X was 17 percent faster than 69 50 X in
this test while it was also 19 percent
faster than horizon 7 1800s when
decompressing when it comes to
compression the Rison CPUs aren't really
that efficient
result the seven 100x was 65% faster in
this test the 69 50x has always been a
beast in our Excel test taking just two
seconds to complete the workload this
isn't a memory sensitive test so that
extra bandwidth doesn't really help the
700x pool miles ahead that said it still
offers an 8 percent performance increase
meanwhile the 78 20x match the risin 7
1800 X while the higher o'clock 70 our X
managed to match the 1600 K the PC mark
10 essentials benchmarks aren't really
designed to take advantage of core heavy
CPUs rather they simulate common
everyday ways people use their PC the
workloads from this test that we're
looking at cover web browsing and video
conferencing as you can see the 77 ROK
and its superior out-of-the-box clock
speeds make it the best for web browsing
tasks that said thanks to single and
dual-core performance of the 7 100x it
still does a very good job here as do
the other sky like X CPUs the video
conferencing test is a bit more core
heavy as a result that's every 100x does
pull ahead of the 7700 K by an 8 percent
margin that said it is only able to
match the risin 7 1800 X the
productivity test group measures system
performance with everyday office
applications namely looking at
spreadsheets and writing workloads again
these aren't tasks that take advantage
of workstation class hardware so
quad-core such as the core i5 7600 K
still do very well here the digital
content creation test group reflects the
demands of working with digital content
and media the tests include photo
editing rendering and visualization as
well as video editing this graph shows
the performance of the first two test
groups a following graph will look at
video editing performance as expected
the coralline subbing our X does very
well in these tests outscoring the Rison
7 1800 X by 33 percent margin for the
rendering test though it was only 2%
faster for the photo editing test which
does use fewer cause lastly we have the
PC mark 10 video editing results and
again editing typically doesn't tax the
CPU that much and few editing
applications do a good job of utilizing
more than a few calls we certainly see
that here as the 7700 K was by far the
fastest CPU tested the kora 9 1,700 X
did do well here though but it wasn't
that much faster than the 1,800 X Corona
comes as a standalone benchmark
it renders a 16-6 times and we report
the time it takes to complete the task
this application does love threads so
the more the merrier and the quicker
you'll be done and you can move on to
something else as you can see the core I
970 100x took just 97 seconds which is
less than half the time it took the core
i7 77 okay it's also a 34 percent
improvement over the 1,800 X meanwhile
the 78 20x roughly matched the 69 50 X
while the 70 100 ax was slower than the
60 nano okay but it did add out the rise
in 5 1600 blender is a popular
application it's often used for
benchmarking CPU performance for both
AMD and Intel the open source software
is free to download and I've used
version 2.7 8 and for the workload I've
used aim DS rise and render file so yeah
the new Intel CPUs are rendering rise in
CPUs hmm anyway the core I nine 1700 X
didn't seem to waste any time pondering
the implications as I got the job done a
blistering fast 18 seconds meanwhile the
core i7 7e at 20 X took 21 and a half
seconds and the 700 X was done in 26
seconds
overall very strong performance from the
new Intel CPUs for our handbrake test we
take a 4k high quality video file and
convert it from page to 64 down at 1080p
using HEV C also known as h.265 the
numbers are seeing here in the graph
showing how many frames per second each
CPU was able to transcode the video at
the core I nine seven 100x is a beast
managing 30 point seven frames a second
making it 31 percent faster than 69 50x
and 51 percent faster than the horizon
718 hundred x the higher clock speed of
the seven 100x really helps here though
the other memory bandwidth is equally
important even the 78 20x is able to
pull ahead of the 69 50x speeding it by
9 percent margin remember this is an
Intel 8 core part versus their previous
generation 10 core part so mighty
impressive stuff meanwhile the six core
7800 X is able to virtually match the 69
50 X right so this is the test I care
most about as I spend quite a bit of
time each day rendering videos so the
CPU that can save me the most time here
is generally the one I'd go with for
example the PC used to render this video
packs a core i7 69 50 X and I had
planned to
probably replace it with thread Ripper
soon that said the current version of
Premiere Pro CC isn't that good at
taking advantage of high coil count CPUs
and as a result the 79 50 X is just 4%
fast and the 69 50 X so it's a bit of a
disappointing result the benchmark is
career accelerated by gtx 980ti so keep
that in mind that said though there
aren't a huge amount of effects in my
videos for the GPU to accelerate okay so
I get these a hot gaming focus CPUs but
if I skipped over the games entirely I
can't imagine that would go down too
well with many of you so I have picked
four CPU intensive games but I think do
a good job of utilizing as many calls as
pretty much any game does these days
that said most are best handled by six
core 12 thread CPU that'll feel one for
example still get to the highest frame
rates on the core i7 77 oh okay still
for a core heavy CPU the 1700 X does a
very good job as does the 78 20x and 70
100 X Mark III was one of the few games
that really took advantage of the
horizon CPUs when they were first
released allowing AMD who enjoy strong
gains over the 77 rotate in this title
however the game was quickly patched to
become less CPU intensive perhaps better
optimized is the word I'm not really
sure but the direct result was lower CPU
utilization while achieving slightly
better frame rates here we see that the
game still favors the higher clock 77
okay but also still requires more than
four threads as the 7600 K is quite a
long way down our graph hitman is a
surprisingly CPU demanding title please
know I've tested using DirectX 11 to
avoid any issues in video GPU seem to
have Witter Eisen when using DirectX 12
though I haven't revisited this recently
anyway the skylake CPU is performed very
well they'll against the 77 ok that's
the fastest option here finally we have
ashes the singularity the only game that
can really take advantage of a 10 core
CPU though at this point it's more of a
synthetic benchmark than an actual game
anyone plays still it does give us an
idea of what future games might require
though how far away that future is is
anyone's guess up until now the new
skylake x processors have looked mighty
impressive and now they're starting to
look mighty power-hungry for six cores
semi 100x sucks down the same 193 watts
as the horizon 7 1800 X I was hoping it
would be closer to the 1600 X if I'm
honest
still though the 700x isn't really the
issue here both the eight core and ten
core models are considerably more
power-hungry both push system
consumption over 200 watts and that's
significantly more than what the 69 50 X
system consumed 226 watts is a huge
amount of power draw in the excel test
so let's move on and see what the power
consumption figures will like forcing a
bunch are 15 okay so these numbers are
even worse quite a bit worse the reason
for this being that the Cinebench r15
test is not just more intensive but it
also runs for quite a bit longer so the
chips heat up more and consume even more
power for this test the 700 X while
sucking out almost 260 watts whereas the
68 50x hit just 212 watts clearly those
higher clock speeds come at a real cost
although our coverage is late we still
haven't had that much time to play
around with the new core X CPUs just a
few days in fact so I'm yet to spend
much time overclocking in fact I've
really only briefly taken a bit of a
look with the 1700 X the results were
mixed my chip only managed to stable 4.6
gigahertz overclock no matter how much
voltage I throw at it I just couldn't
stabilize anything higher the system
would boot in the windows but it would
end up blue screaming within a few
moments of running any kind of stress
test stability might improve in future
BIOS updates or perhaps I just have a
bit of a dud CPU looking around the
internet seemed as most of stuck at 4.6
gigahertz like I am but others have
managed to stabilize their system at 4.7
or 4 point 8 gigahertz
however the frequency isn't my greatest
concern right now using just 1.2 volts
which is all I needed for a stable four
point six could get hurt overclock on
all caused the system consumption went
from 259 watts which already deemed
quite high to an insane 402 watts and
yet that might not actually be the worst
part the deal breaker is probably the
operating temps cooling the seven 100 X
was the corsair h 100 IV - and despite
being a Premium 240 millimeter
all-in-one liquid cooler temps
skyrocketed the second CPU is placed
under any kind of load hitting 90
degrees almost right off the bat before
climbing further towards 100 degrees so
unless you have an amazing cooler I'm
not sure overclocking is really going to
be worth it
moving on from overclocking before I
jump to the conclusion let's try and put
the results just seen into perspective
first up let's take a look at the price
versus performance scatter plot for the
Cinebench r15 multi-threaded results so
ideally for all the price versus
performance graphs that I'm about to
show you what you want to see is the CPU
as far right as possible and as well as
possible the further right the better
the performance the lower on the graph
the cheaper the price as you can see the
horizon 7 1800 X is rather far right and
still quite low it is quite a bit better
than the core i7 700 X in terms of value
and remember the 1800 X itself isn't
particularly good value sitting next to
the horizon 7 1700 which sadly I didn't
have time to add but I will for future
videos obviously when compared to the 69
50x the new 1700 X is a massive step
forward in terms of value offering a
much greater performance at a much
better price moving to the blender
results we again see the horizon 7 1800
X and core i7 7800 X are quite similar
in terms of value though again the pesky
r7 1700 will mess things up for Intel
here anyway looking just at Intel's
lineup we see the 70 100 X is again a
huge leap forward priced alongside the
1600 K it offers significantly better
performance in this application the core
I nine seven 100x proved to be a
seriously significant upgrade over
Broadwell II in our handbrake test for
the same money Intel fans are
essentially getting a 50% boost in
performance and I believe the increased
memory bandwidth really helps here this
is something I will look into soon
meanwhile the Rison 7 1800 x finds
ourselves situated between the 700 X and
the 78 20x in terms of price and
performance the corona price versus
performance figures look particularly
impressive for the horizon 5 1600 X as
it sneaks in just behind the core i7
7800 X at a much lower price meanwhile
the 1800 X is much closer to the 78 20x
while again coming in at a lower price
for 7-zip I have only looked at the
decompression results and AMD does much
better here when compared to the
compression testing that's what I feel
most of you do significantly more
decompression work than compression as
you can see for decompression work the
1800 X is a lot better value to the core
i7 1800 X and 78 20x processors looking
at the PC mark rendering and
visualisation figures we see that the
core I nine see 100x is a massive
upgrade
/ what Intel was previously offering
that said for less than half the price
the horizon 7 1800 X isn't that much
slower and in terms of value it also
gives us 78 20x and 70 100x a hard time
lastly we have the Premiere Pro CC
results and here the scatterplot looks
quite a bit different to those seen
previously as this application doesn't
really do a good job of utilizing those
high coil count CPUs even so the 7 100x
does still offer a decent increase in
value over the 1,600 K right so we've
taken a pretty good look at the new core
i-93 100x the core i7 78 20x and the
core i7 7 800 X so the 10 core 8 core
and 6 core parts will have to wait a bit
later in the year before we can check
out the more expensive 12 14 16 and 18
core models so for now let's not worry
about them so what do I make of these
new skylake X parts
okay well firstly I think they are
mighty impressive in terms of
performance and I think we can probably
all agree on that as it stands the core
I 970 100 blows the socks off everything
right now and the 7820 does a good job
of making the previous generation 8 core
CPU with a little sluggish the single
and dual thread performance is also very
impressive roughly on par with the best
quad-core CPUs intel has on offer the
only hiccup here is power consumption
the skylake X parts consume between 20
to 40% more power than the equivalent
Broadway leave parts so that's pretty
brutal although I haven't delved too
deep in the overclocking side of things
just yet it's fair to say based on what
I've seen so far that the massive
increase in power consumption doesn't
bode well for overclocking your typical
go-to all-in-one liquid coolers aren't
really cutting it a serious Do It
Yourself solution will be required
ok so performance is good power
consumption is scary what about the
price well compared to Broadwell either
pricing is a lot less scary bang for
your buck skylake X offers considerably
more we've gone from a $1,700 us asking
price for Intel's 10 core desktop CPU to
$1000 and with that you're getting a
much faster processor albeit a hotter
and hungrier one bokura 970 100x is
still a seriously expensive CPU there's
no denying that but
with no real competition when looking
purely at it from a performance
perspective intel probably can get away
with charging what they are at least for
now thread Ripper will likely change
that in the near future but that's a
story for another day
let's talk eight core CPUs for a minute
there isin seven 1800 s costs four
hundred and six dollars u.s. right now
but smart shoppers will up for a much
cheaper three hundred and ten dollar
1700 model which can be overclocked to
achieve the same performance the core i7
78 20 X and their hand comes in at a
reasonable $600 US making it 30% more
expensive in the 1800 X but almost twice
the price of the 1700 looking at this in
events are 15 multi-threaded performance
the 78 20x is around 30% more powerful
than the 1800 X so the price seems
justified at least over that chip
however moving a real-world applications
the 78 20x was only like 10 percent
faster overall so in terms of
performance there really isn't that much
in it the 78 20x does have the advantage
of 28 PCI Express Lanes to just 16 lanes
for the horizon 7 CPUs the limited PCIe
lanes authorizing is something thread
ripple will address in a rather big way
shortly but if you need the extra PCI
Express Lanes
then the 7820 becomes the more obvious
option for now basically though if you
do care about value at all
Rison 7 is the obvious option as a
decent X 370 board starts at about a
hundred and ten dollars us making the
CPU motherboard combo just 420 dollars
u.s. if you intelligently opt to the r7
1700 meanwhile the 78 20x and the
cheapest X 299 motherboard will set you
back about eight hundred and thirty
dollars u.s. again basically twice the
price for nowhere near twice the
performance in any application meanwhile
the six core 700 X roughly matches the
1800 X in terms of performance though
they do trade blows depending on the
application still if you throw the r7
1700 into the mix even Intel's most
affordable skylake exceed PU is a tough
sell that said even if money was no
object that'll be nice I'd still have a
tough time picking between the AMD
horizon 7 CPUs and then you six core and
8 core skylake X CPUs pakora 9 7 100 X
is a little clearer cut at will
for now so yeah if money really is no
object then the 700 X is the way to go
the performance is exceptional you get
loads of PCIe lanes overclocking is an
option at least to a degree many degrees
in fact and the X to 99 platform is
superior to AMD's X 370 however even if
thread report wasn't incoming if you
look at this from a value perspective
the 1700 X still makes no sense in a
world where the Rison 7 CPUs exist that
being the case as impressive as the
performance of the 700 X is I don't
recommend buying into Intel's latest
platform at least not right now
my advice is hold out see what AMD has
to offer and then go from there
until me very well have to adjust
pricing that's going to do it for this
one there's still plenty more testing to
be done and I do have those kb like x
cpus to confuse the heck outta me as
well so that should be fun
I'm your host Eve see you again soon
