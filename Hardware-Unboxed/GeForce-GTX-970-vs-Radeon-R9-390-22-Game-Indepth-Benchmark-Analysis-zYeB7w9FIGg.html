I'm your host Matt and in this episode
we're going to compare and benchmark the
geforce gtx 970 and the Radeon r9 390
last week we compared the geforce gtx
960 to the Radeon r9 380 to determine
which was the best $200 offering out of
the 22 games tested the r9 380 was
faster in 80% of them and as a result
the gcf's 960 was an average 60% slower
at 1080p that being the case we declared
the Radeon r9 380 as the winner after
posting that video I've received an
overwhelming number of requests for a
similar comparison featuring the GeForce
GTX 970 versus the Radeon r9 390 so most
of my week has been spent benchmarking
to make that happen the benchmarks
focused solely on frame rate performance
though I'm picking a winner will be
taking into account power consumption
and overclocking potential - speaking of
which based on our own findings the
iron.i 390 is an average capable of a 50
percent overclock while the GTX 970 is
slightly better achieving a 20 percent
overclock on average overclocking you
might not sway us one way or the other
but power consumption is a real
consideration and this is where NVIDIA
has a real advantage the Radeon r9 390
consumed on average 40 percent more
power in our testing when comparing
entire system consumption this is
obviously a significant figure so it'll
be interesting to see how their frame
rate performance compares testing with
just a few select games doesn't really
give you the full picture so for this
head-to-head battle we've selected 22 of
the latest and most popular graphically
intense games to run the 970 and 390
through testing takes place at 1440p as
well as 4k although neither of these
GPUs are really intended for 4k gaming
on top of that we'll be testing each
game with two different quality settings
for example battlefield 4 was tested
using the maximum in-game quality
settings with two times multi sample
anti-aliasing enabled and then again
with a a disable completely The Witcher
3 has been tested with hair works
enabled and then disabled on Tomb Raider
was tested with and with our
press affects both GPUs were tested
using a core i5 6600 K processor under a
fresh install of Windows 10 with the
latest drivers installed all of that
being said let's jump into the
benchmarks the 970 average 48 frames per
second of 1440p making it 6 frames per
second faster than the 390 in Metro
Redux a 14% performance advantage
disabling tessellation eliminated the
nine seven years performance advantages
the 390 became three frames per second
faster with a total of 59 frames per
second with tress effects enabled the
970 was actually faster than the 390
with an average of 55 frames per second
thank you 7 frames per second or 15
percent faster and tomato toning tres
effects off still saw the 970 lead the
390 by 7 planes per second at 1440p
battlefield 4 was tightly contested of
1440p both graphics cards rendered 59
frames per second with 2 times msaa
enabled disabling anti-aliasing played
into the hands of the 970 which was now
8 frames per second faster than the 390
with a buttery smooth 79 frames per
second they've played best on the 390 as
it delivered 53 frames per second on
average making the Radian 4 frames per
second faster than the 917 turning SSA a
off significantly increased performance
as expected and now the 390 was just 2
frames per second faster than the 917
again we find another tight battle
between these 2 graphics cards this time
we're testing with watchdogs here the
390 was just a single frame faster than
the 917 turning off HPA o improved
performance by 26% at 1440p and saw both
graphics cards deliver an average of 68
frames per second the 390 was clearly
faster in hitman with an average of 67
frames per second while the 970 was good
for just 55 frames per second making an
18% slower
testing hitman with FX AAA didn't change
the performance margin at all is the 970
was still 12 frames per second slower
than the 390 using the very high quality
setting is all lower the 970 average 73
frames per second at 1440p and GTA 5
making it 11 percent faster than the 390
which managed 66 frames per second
reducing the quality settings too high
allowed both graphics cards average
above 90 frames
second though the 970 was still faster
I'll be at by 3 frames per second the
970 was good for 71 frames per second in
civilization beyond Earth making a six
percent faster than the 390 with an
average of 67 frames per second
turning anti-aliasing off against our 4
frames per second separation in favor of
the 970 between these two graphics cards
the 970 was 7% faster than 390 when
testing with Total War adalah although
it should point out that this was just a
2 frames per second difference reducing
the quality preset from extreme to
quality allowed the 970 to render 45
frames per second on average making it 4
frames per second faster than the 390
both graphics cards averaged 37 frames
per second at 14-14 The Witcher 3 Wild
Hunt with hair works enabled turning off
hair works favor the 390 which was now 2
frames per second faster than the 970
with a total of 46 frames per second
testing with Middle Earth shadow of
mordor saw the 390 average 59 frames per
second and the 970 58 frames per second
so it's fair to say things were very
even in this title that said using the
very high-quality preset the 390 became
5 frames per second faster than the 970
for a very playable 67 frames per second
Assassin's Creed unity is a game like
hitman absolution where the 390
demonstrates a serious performance
advantage this time with an average of
just 33 frames per second the 970 was
18% slower than the 390 which sat more
comfortably on 40 frames per second
turning off percentage closer soft
shadows and screen space ambient
occlusion helped the 970 out quite a lot
and now performed within one frame per
second of the 390 like most of the games
tested thus far we find that the
performance is very competitive between
the 970 and 390 in Crysis 3 390 was just
a single frame faster at 1440p with an
average of 40 frames per second
changing to x sm AAA for fxaa improved
performance dramatically as the 390 was
now good for an average of 59 frames per
second again just 1 frame per second
faster than the 970 yet again we find
almost nothing separating these two
graphics cards this time and dragon
aging
in here the 390 was just one frame per
second faster than the 970 with an
average of 48 frames per second to save
me anti-aliasing entirely it really
helped out the 970 which was now found
to be four frames per second faster than
the 390 with an average of 70 frames per
second just a single frame separated the
two graphics cards in arma 3 as the 970
rendered 53 frames per second opposed to
52 frames per second for the 390 toning
ssao off along with anti-aliasing the
970 was able to pull a frames per second
the head of the 390 with an average of
79 frames per second the 970 was four
frames per second faster than 390 in
good order sport with four times msaa
enabled changing the anti-aliasing
method from msaa to CMAA played further
into the hand of the 970 which extended
its lead over the 390 by eight frames
per second
both graphics cards perform very well in
f1 2015 with an average of over 60
frames per second using the maximum
in-game quality settings the 390 was the
faster of the two with 67 frames per
second giving a 2 frame per second
performance advantage over the 970
lowering the quality setting saw the 390
beat the 970 by a single frame far cry 4
was dominated by the 390 which averaged
39 frames per second making it 6 frames
per second faster than the 917 changing
hpi-o 2's SBC while also setting the
anti-aliasing mode from MSAA to SMA a
allowed for quite a bit of extra
performance despite these changes the
390 maintain a solid lead over the 970
as it enjoyed a 6 frame per second
advantage the 970 averaged 48 frames per
second and dying light making it just 3
frames per second faster than the 390 or
7% faster turning off anti-aliasing
depth of field in H Bao allowed the 970
to extend its lead over the 398 or 6
frames per second just 1 frame per
second favoured the 390 in Sleeping Dogs
as the average 42 frames per second
opposed to 41 frames per second for the
970 turning off SSA and reducing their
fxaa level to normal significantly
boosted performance at 1440p the the 1
frame per second performance margin
remained as expected the 970 delivered a
considerable performance advance
to gym project cars with 56 frames per
second making it nine frames per second
faster than the 390 reducing the
anti-aliasing mode from msaa and SMA a
two fxaa we see a reasonable gain in
performance the 970 was now able to
average 70 frames per second though this
meant it was just four frames per second
faster than the 319 finally we have Call
of Duty advanced warfare and here we
find more competitive results the 970
was just one frame per second faster
than the 390 with an average of 58
frames per second disabling SSA a and
using FX a a rather than SMA a
performance virtually doubles though the
970 was just one frame per second faster
than the 390 the battle for the best
value $300 graphics card was closely
fought though in the end we feel NVIDIA
won this round due to the GTX 970 being
the more efficient graphics card
breaking down the framerate performance
we found things to be truly neck and
neck between the 970 and the 390 of the
22 games tested the 970 was the fastest
in 10 and coincidentally so was the 390
with two games resulting in a tie not
only was the number of title wins even
but so too were the performance ratios
of the 22 games tested there wasn't a
single frame when averaged separating
two graphics cards using the higher
quality settings at 1440p both the 917
the 390 averaged 52 frames per second
meanwhile reducing the quality settings
so both cards averaged exactly 71 frames
per second which is quite amazing really
another way of looking at it would be to
say that in games where the 970 was
faster it was an average 9% faster
likewise the games where it was slower
the 970 was an average 9% slower it was
also interesting to find that at 4k the
three and a half gigabyte 970 was so
competitive with the 82 by 390 again on
average nothing separated a two so even
in memory demanding situations the 398
gigabyte memory buffer is of little
consequence I'm not defending a videos
choice to advertise the 970 as a 4
gigabyte graphics card when it can
really only efficiently address three
and a half gigabytes but it has to be
said that this doesn't impact
performance in any meaningful way the
only reason we could see game is going
for the 390 over the 9
at the same price would be for crossfire
performance that's a we're not entirely
confident crossfire 390s would beat sli
970 s in the end it's the GeForce GTX
970 superior efficiency that sees the
Radeon r9 390 consume an average 40%
more power that gets it over the line
well I hope that settles the $300
performance GPU battle for now I'd like
to hear what you guys think in the
comments and please let us know if you'd
