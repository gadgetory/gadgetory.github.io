video I realize I'm a bit off-center I'm
usually somewhere around here but the
reason why I'm not is it's fairly
obvious anyway we do have some cool
hardware on display you'll notice that
the gtx 1070 TI is back last week in
video did announce this graphics card we
can't show benchmarks yet but it has
finally been officially announced and
it's a graphics card based on the
comments that I saw in my unboxing and
teardown video that many of you thought
wasn't real anyway the gtx 1070 TI is
very real and you can now preorder it
nvidia and their board partners are
happy to take your money they're
starting at around four hundred and
fifty dollars u.s. and they are
available at major online retailers and
the release date is next week though and
unfortunately I cannot show you any
benchmark data before then so yeah this
is another teaser however for this one
we are building my new GPU test system I
think that's gonna be a bit special and
that will be based on Intel's new 8th
gen core series of course because well
potentially not the best value they are
the best gaming CPUs especially the 8700
K it's a bit of a weapon but not really
here to debate that today we are putting
together the ultimate what I think is
the ultimate GPU test ring but we did go
about it a little bit differently we're
not gonna just slap in the 8700 K
straight away having had a look at the
specs now and the pricing of the 1070 TI
I think that's gonna be a pretty it's
gonna be in a sweet spot in terms of
value for gamers a bit like the core i5
8400 I thought pairing those two
together that could be a really really
nice combo basically for those of you
who aren't up to speed yet we are really
expecting GT X 1080 light performance
from the 1070 Ti it does have just 5
percent fewer cuda cores so there's not
a lot in it
the only real big discrepancy is the
memory bandwidth but even so we're not
expecting the 1070 Ti to trail eternity
by that much
speaking of products that you can order
and throw some money yet but you can
actually get your hands on you
how about the Intel Core i5 value 400 I
know that's got a few of your bit riled
up you want to just buy one because
you've seen the benchmark results but
yeah unfortunately not to be just yet it
was a bit of a soft launch that one I
will be testing the core i5 8400 against
the overclocked Rison 5 1600 I haven't
forgot about that I know you guys want
to see that and that will be on the
channel in the next day or two actually
will be a video about that tomorrow then
I think the benchmark video will be the
next day but yeah stay tuned that is
coming up either way though the 8400 is
a very impressive CPU and if you can get
it for the MSRP which is less than $200
u.s. it's an exceptionally good buy
right now though the 260 use dollars
that I've been seeing it at places like
Newegg and Amazon it's a bit of a hard
pass right now anyway assuming that next
week the core i5 8400 turns to supply
we'd have a long shot that one and the
gtx 1070 TI doesn't sell out like 6
seconds which seems to be the way GPU
releases go these days then those two
would be in my opinion the perfect
pairing having not fully tested this yet
just assuming based on the specs but
yeah and I think we're too far off the
mark there but yeah for now I'm going to
assume that they are going to be the
perfect pairing and I'm going to put
them in my new corsair test system as
was the case with my sky like verizon
and kb lake test system builds Corsa has
again supplied the bulk of the
components for my new coffee library on
hand today we have for the build the new
white version of the crystal series 570
X and I did use for the previous two
builds the off the table the black
version of this case very impressed with
it so I'm quite excited to check out the
new white model complementing the white
case will be course as our MX rm7 50 X
750 watt 80 plus gold certified fully
modular power supply it's a nice power
supply and it's white yeah I suppose
apart from being what it does have 100%
Japanese capacitors does have white
slave cables and a very cool thing is it
does have a
any warranty so that's pretty huge in
keeping with the white theme we also
have the new Vengeance RGB memory and I
say new because I believe the white
version is very new and Corsairs shot
over a 32 gigabyte kit so that'll do
nicely it's ddr4 3000 stuff yet to play
around with the RGB memory from Corsair
but I have seen it on displayed a few
trade shows and events and I have to say
it looks quite special then the final
Corsair item on the menu is the
tried-and-true Hydra series h108 v2 I've
used this guy and over half a dozen
builds now it's yet to let me down it's
a really good quality cooler I like the
240 mill radiator and
it's fairly well priced as well for a
high-end all-in-one liquid cooler it is
these overkill for the 8400 I'll admit
but when I do inevitably swap in the 87
or okay for my GPU testing down the
track this thing will no doubt come in
very handy now a key component of this
build that i'm yet to talk about is
gigabytes Xen 370 or ask gaming 7
motherboard this is a well stocked and
incredibly good looking at 370 board and
it is priced below $300 u.s. so that
makes it a very solid choice even for
those that are looking for something
like a locked core i5 8400 is it it does
offer a flexible upgrade path in the
future or something like the 8700 K or
perhaps even something better in the
future
so enough waffling on from me I've
talked about a look and parents we've
checked him out I'm excited to put the
build together
so let's cure for smooth tune and get
building
now that is a sweet-looking test drink
probably I'd say my most impressive yet
I came away pretty impressed earlier
this year with the KB Lake and that was
a black blue kind of build and yeah it
looks really good than the rise in
version which was obviously kind of an
orangey reddish rig that looked good as
well but I think this white black
version with the RGB lighting which I've
currently got sort of set to a red at
the moment I think this one takes the
cake later today I will temporarily swap
out the GTX 1072 I'll install the Vega
64 liquid core graphics card and that
will be to finish that overclocked
horizon 5 1600 versus Core i5 8400
comparison than all you guys keep
hassling me to get done but then I will
put the 1070 TI back in there because I
will be testing a couple of new games
like Assassin's Creed origins and
Wolfenstein - the new Colossus for the
gtx 1070 TI review which will be coming
later in the week there's certainly a
lot of testing to be done so it's right
to work with this brand new test system
I'm your host Steve I'll see you again
soon guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
