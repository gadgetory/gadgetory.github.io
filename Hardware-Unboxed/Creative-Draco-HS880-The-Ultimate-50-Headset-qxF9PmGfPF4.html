headsets over the last year and have
been a big fan in fact my daily driver
is their Sound Blaster xh7 not
everybody's looking to shell out over
150 bucks on the headset though so what
are the more budget-friendly options
well creative or submitted a new headset
and the scariest box have ever seen
called the Draco HS 880 and it comes in
at just 50 USD or 90 bucks in Australia
but what do we get for this slash down
price let's take a look and find out
looking at the box you can't really see
much of the headset themselves so I
didn't really know to expect opening him
up once I pulled them out I was actually
fairly impressed I think it's a pretty
nice looking headset the headband is a
sturdy plastic with a steel core and
features a nice memory foam pad
underneath and extends down to the ear
cups that are able to rotate and sit
flat on your desk or around your neck
these are held in place with glossy arms
and have a nice deep red feature that
gives the design some character soft
leather at wrapped padding makes the u
kyv sit comfortably on your head and the
ear cups are finished off with a black
cap featuring creatives logo in the
middle something I really like is the
fact that the mic is detachable as well
as nice and long so you wrap it right
around in front of your mouth with it
popped out they actually make a pretty
decent looking Street headset - another
great inclusion on this lower pricepoint
headset is the inline remote control
found on the long red cable here you can
control your volume as well as toggle
microphone mute unfortunately there
isn't a microphone included in the
remote so to make phone calls you need
to use the detachable boom mic but hey
we can't really complain too much at 50
US dollars can we the headsets
definitely aimed at PC gamers with its
split cable and featuring two three pole
jacks to use it with a console you need
one of those 4 pole adapters the cables
really quite long two and a half meters
so you've got plenty of distance to work
with between you and your PC in terms of
sound quality I was really quite
impressed the Drako uses 40 millimeter
neodymium drivers from creator to
produce sound that's very suited to
gaming particularly first-person
shooters I feel the bass is very punchy
but I suppose the soundstage isn't as
big as I'm used to so it was quite
noticeable to me they were definitely
serviceable for movies and
- and if you're not a picky audiophile
you'll enjoy the sound and volume you
get from this headset the my quality is
pretty good - I've recorded this section
of the audio to give you guys an idea as
it expected pretty clear and we find for
Skype and gaming there's one more little
extra in the package a custom carry bag
for the headset this is a really nice
touch and at this price point it's one
of those little things that the
Hellfires feel like they're getting
great value for their money this is
handy for keeping the long cable from
ending up everywhere in your bag when
you're on the go and provides a bit of
scratch protection for the headset - so
overall creative it produced a sturdy
and attractive design wrapped around
some pretty powerful 40 millimeter
drivers included a clear sounding
detachable broom life and even thrown in
a carry bag all for fifty US dollars
the only other little extra would have
liked to see it would be the four pole
adapter the console game is but these
can be had on eBay for next to nothing
if you're looking for a budget headset
then I honestly can't see being
disappointed with the Drakkar HS 880
what do you guys think do you know of a
better budget headset let me know in the
