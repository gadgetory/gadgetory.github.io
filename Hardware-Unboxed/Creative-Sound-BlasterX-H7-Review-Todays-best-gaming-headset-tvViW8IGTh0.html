my soundblaster XH series family of
headsets when the age sevens arrived
last week and I've been using them
non-stop since the h7 headset is the Big
Daddy of the pack offering features and
sound above and beyond the H 3 and H
fire before it with only a few details
revealed today I've been very curious to
see what exactly the h 7s offer over its
predecessor and having tested them for a
solid week I've been suitably impressed
let's take a look now so I can share my
insights into this very awesome headset
the design of the h7 is very similar to
that of the h5 they share the same
pattern leatherette headband which
extends down to the same shaped ear cap
arms this time though in a cool-looking
brushed black metal as opposed to silver
the ear cups are the same size shape and
build although this time the X on the
sandblaster X logo is illuminated for
quite a nice looking effect looking
further down the headset we find the
same detachable noise reduction
microphone which is thin and light with
one of the easiest longest and most
pliable mic arms that I've seen to date
on any headset the tip comes with a
supplier than simple wind buffer that
can be popped off and on if for some
reason you ever wanted to take it off
the design of the headset is just simple
without looking plain
I believe this simple design really
contributes to the headsets overall
light weight which is incredibly
important for comfort especially over
long gaming sessions the h5 and h7
models are both very very comfortable
headsets overall the lightweight as
mentioned combined with the well padded
headband and very gently padded ear
cuffs make for a very forgettable where
forgettable is and you can forget that
you're wearing them which is probably
the Holy Grail in terms of gaming
headset design in my opinion anyway some
headsets tend to squeeze your head a bit
too hard too I didn't have this issue at
all in the h7s both rest easily on your
head but don't fall off either if you
shake your head around connectivity is
the area where the h7 excels both
overall and over its little brother the
h5 with the h5 s and analog only headset
the h7 s double up is both an analog and
digital USB headset an X branded inline
remote a short distance away from the
headset is where you can attach the
micro USB cable for the digital signal
or alternatively there's a
three-and-a-half millimeter jack
available for simply using them as an
analog device the inline remote features
large mic mute toggle a play/pause
phonecall button and then lastly a
volume wheel it's through the USB
connection that the h7 7.1 surround
sound is enabled this can be customized
in the Sound Blaster X acoustic engine
software we can also play with a number
of other settings first of all there's a
number of custom built presets supplied
by creative including some for specific
games like Call of Duty and dota on the
acoustic engine tab you can then adjust
and create your own profiles to is that
an equaliser page where there are also a
number of presets and the ability to
create and save your own and then on the
scalp mode tab you can toggle just that
scalp mode a sound mode that's designed
specifically to help you hear enemies
from further away the voice FX tab
allows you to mess around the way that
your mic recording is processed it has
some pretty funny presets of its own
finally in the Advanced Settings tab you
can test the 7.1 surround sound toy with
simple mixer settings and also customize
the illumination of the X logo to
pulsate along with the song you're
playing which looks cool but you'll
never see it will you the sound
performance of the h7s is fantastic as
you'd expect if it is the same angled 50
millimeter full spectrum drivers that
were found in the H 5s and these are
mapped some very good quality audio for
gaming headset they sounded good by
default in movies music and games and
then with the acoustic engine software
you can really customize the sound to
suit whatever you're playing 17 presets
though will probably cover most people I
only really switch between the music
profile and Call of Duty for
first-person gaming the mic quality is
good as you can hear on my test now it's
one of the better gaming headset marks
I've heard probably only eclipsed by the
pulk Stryker Pro p1 but the difference
is fairly negligible once you using a
service where the quality is limited by
the upload such as discord Skype or most
in-game chat functions overall the Sound
Blaster xh7 is no doubt a really great
headset the design is simple yet
attractive it's one of the most
comfortable headsets on the market the
sound quality from the 50 millimeter
drives is great and the accompanying
acoustic engine software's honestly I
matched certainly as far as I've seen in
regards to pricing the h7 is available
on ebay commie you right now for 167
Australian dollars which is an extremely
good price
considering the h5 can only be had for
around 150 dollars at those prices it's
really a no-brainer for the extra
features in the USA the h7 s can be ad
for 130 dollars the h5 s can be picked
up
about $96 the two headsets feature the
same audio drivers but if you want
out-of-the-box surround sound additional
USB connectivity and the additional
software options and the h7s of what you
need thanks for joining me for another
sound blaster X headset review I'm your
host Matt as always and I'll see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
