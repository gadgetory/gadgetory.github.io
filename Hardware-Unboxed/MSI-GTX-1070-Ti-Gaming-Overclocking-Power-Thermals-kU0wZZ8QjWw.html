going to unboxing you nvidia gtx 1070 TI
founders edition so let's do that any
minute now and there we go
unboxed then you found as edition
graphics card and well that's about all
we have time for there we're now going
to test the msi gtx 1070 TI had you
there for a minute didn't I
I'm not really sure what Nvidia are
expecting me to do with this I just got
it like an hour ago and they're releases
today less than 24 hours from now so
yeah that's about all the time we have
for the founders edition graphics card
anyway moving on please note I do have a
34 game comparison between the 1070 TI
and nine other GPUs multiple resolutions
in the works and that will be on the
channel in the next day or two
once my voice fully recovers because
yeah that's gonna be a big one and as
you can probably tell I'm struggling a
bit as it is I had of course intended to
release that video today but
unfortunately last weekend I did get
sick and I've been very sick throughout
the week I lost my voice and yeah I
haven't really got it back yet I've
started to recover yesterday I couldn't
talk at all I have been taking it easy
this is about the only talking I will be
doing today I've saved my voice for this
one video because I have to get it done
Abby I was forced to cancel this week's
episode and upgrade my PC please as well
because of those reasons but don't worry
for those of you who enjoy this series
it has just been delayed until next
Tuesday and I do have another awesome
AOC gaming monitor to give away so it
will be worth the wait but again I
apologize for the delay on that one so
the big benchmark video I know many of
you are expecting today has been delayed
but only by a few days hopefully we will
have an insane amount of data to go over
shortly today we are going to sample a
little bit
that data but I want to focus more on
the overclocking performance power
consumption and operating temperatures
of the MSI version for those of you who
missed it last week I did unbox this
graphics card and I did a bit of a
teardown so he had a closer look at it I
also noted a few of the specifications
but let's quickly go over all that again
before jumping into the benchmarks the
gtx 1070 TI comes armed with 2432 cuda
cores which is just 5 percent fewer than
that of the GTX 10 80 but 27% more than
the gtx 1070 however while lis 1070 TI
is much closer to the gtx 1080 than it
is at 1070 when it comes to a core count
things are a bit different on the memory
side here the 1072 eye retains the same
gddr5 memory as the vanilla 1070 and
that means 2,000 mega hurt memory
providing a transfer speed at gigabits
per second then thanks to a 256-bit wide
memory bus the end result is the same
256 gigabytes per second and memory
bandwidth which means it's 25% down on
the GTX 1080 and almost 40% down on the
newer 11 gigabits per second models
further complicating things are the
clock speeds for the cause but GTX 1072
eye matches the base clock frequency of
the GTX 1080 at 1600 and 7 megahertz and
that means it's clocked 7 percent higher
than the stock gtx 1070 graphics cards
however the boost clock is lower than
that of the 1080 and instead matches
that of the 1070 this all makes it a
little difficult to work at exactly
where the 1072 I will sit between the
1070 and 1080 we can safely assume that
in less memory demanding scenarios it
will be very close to the 1080 in terms
of performance well it will be closer to
the 1070 where memory throughput is more
critical now something key to note here
is that NVIDIA has tied the hands of
their board partners somewhat at least
for now anyway
whereas companies like MSI can produce
factory overclocked gtx 1070 and GT X
1080 models they aren't allowed to do
this with the gtx 1070 TI rather it's up
to the consumer to extract any extra
performance this means the potential to
extract quite a bit more from the gtx
1070 TI should be possible and i suspect
out of the box the msi duty
x10 72 hour gaming won't look
particularly impressive when compared to
the gaming experience of the 1070 and
the 1080 for example a gtx 1070 game e^x
already has a 5% overclock applied from
the factory and that will help it reduce
the massive core deficit so without
wasting any more time let's see how the
new msi gtx 1070 TI gaming compares to
the 1070 and 1080 gaming ex models as
well as AMD's Radeon rx Vega lineup
first up we have some battlefield one
results to show us just how well the msi
gtx 1070 TI does out of the box at 1440p
using the ultra quality preset it was
good for an average of 93 FPS which
meant it was 12% faster than the gtx
1070 and 11% slower than the gtx 1080 so
pretty much smack bang in the middle end
and as luck would have it that places it
alongside the air-cooled rx Vega
graphics cards I doubt that's a
coincidence
testing with Mass Effect Andromeda we
find this time the gtx 1070 TR is 9%
fast and the factory overclocked gtx
1070 gaming ex but 11 percent slower
than the 1080 model that said it was
able to match the air-cooled vega 64
graphics card with 61 FPS on average
then finally before getting into the
overclocking I have some Deus Ex mankind
divided results and here the 1070 TI was
just 6 percent faster than the gtx 1070
gaming ex this time it was 12% solid in
the GTX 1080 so we might find a memory
overclocking will make a big difference
here aim D does do quite well in this
title and therefore the gtx 1070 TI
isn't quite able to catch the vega 56
graphics card moving on we have the
stock power consumption figures and here
we can see that the msi gtx 1070 TI
gaming consumes the same amount of power
as the gtx 1080 gaming ex which is
really only slightly more than the gtx
1070 gaming ex so there's certainly
nothing unexpected about these results
and it means that the 1072 i reduced
system consumption by 8% when compared
to vega 56 when it comes to temperatures
MSI's Twin Frozr 6 cooler keeps things
cool and quiet
if GPU temperatures remain below 60
degrees the tox 2.0 fans won't even spin
up under load the card maxes out at just
64 degrees and the card ran virtually
silent at this temperature it was
without question quieter than the case
for hands in my test system which are
already very quiet so this should point
to some fairly decent overclocking
Headroom and speaking of which let's
check it out okay so time to get serious
the gtx 1070 to a is fairly impressive
out of the box but it's not exactly
going too well many enthusiasts I mean
it sits between the 1070 and 1080 in
terms of performance which is fine and
all but it also sits between them in
terms of price which do we really need
another card in this $100 price cut
since you can't buy a factory
overclocked 1072 I'm curious to see
what's possible here so I fired up the
MSI Afterburner utility and started the
process of working out how far the core
in memory could go in the end island and
on what I feel is a pretty mild
overclock to be honest the base core
clock was happy at seventeen hundred and
sixty-seven megahertz while the memory
went to 2,250 two megahertz that's a 10%
bump for the core and a 12% increase for
the memory this resulted in a turbo
boost 3.0 frequency of at least two
gigahertz in games which is about a 9%
jump from the stock boost frequency I
was hoping to reach at least 2050
megahertz and I'm sure we will see
reviewers achieving that or better
perhaps I just was a bit unlucky with my
sample anyway what kind of gains does
this overclock netis let's move on to
find out once again we have battlefield
one up first and here we see an
impressive 13% jump in performance
hitting 105 FPS and that is enough to
match the GTX 1080 gaming X although we
only managed around a 10 percent
frequency boost this extra gain has come
from the increase to memory bandwidth
the good news here is that you can
achieve GT X 1080 light performance
through overclocking factory overclocked
1080 performance in fact for those
wondering a custom overclock and a
standard 1070 gaming X card still sees
at full just short of the 1072 I stock
out of the box figures this time we see
a very large 15 percent gain in Mass
Effect Andromeda again that's a little
higher than I was expecting
raising the power limb and overclocking
the memory has had a big impact here and
now the 1070 ti gaming is able to just
edge out the GTX 1080 gaming X
for what is a very impressive result in
this title then finally we say 13%
increase when testing Deus Ex mankind
divided and this was enough for the
overclocked 1070 ti to match the
overclocked Vega 56 graphics card in an
AMD sponsored title nonetheless again we
see that an overclocked 1070 Ti is able
to mimic the performance of the GT x
1080 gaming X as surprising as the frame
rate results were I have to say the
power consumption figures are just as
surprising despite increasing the
voltage the total system consumption for
the 1070 Ti configuration increased by
just 14% to 346 watts
that's only 5% more power draw than the
stock value 56 graphics card and 22%
less once vega's overclocked leaving the
fan profile on auto the MSI 1070 TI
gaming still ran very quiet and yet
temperatures maxed at ajust 69 degrees
after an hour-long stress test that said
for the most part it's a turd around 68
degrees and I feel anything south of 70
degrees is very cool especially when the
cards running at near silent volume
levels ok so firstly I realize that
wasn't the released a coverage many of
you are hoping for unfortunately though
getting any more testing done with the
limited time I had available due to
being sick just was it possible so that
said though I think every man and his
dog probably will be flooding the
internet with a gtx 1070 TI review today
so it might not be a bad thing that i've
had to delay the really in-depth big
benchmark video for and day or two still
i like that i've had the chance to focus
on overclocking thermals and power draw
for the msi gtx 1070 TI gaming model
it's pretty clear based on this very
limited testing that out of the box the
1070 TI sits smack-bang between the
factory overclock 1070 and 1080 graphics
cards if the game is particularly memory
sensitive the 1070 TI does perform more
like a factory overclock 1070 at least
before you overclock it that being the
case for the 1070 TI 2 really makes
sense
you have to overclock it and those that
do will be rewarded basically doing so
enables factory overclock GT X 1080
light performance and here we were able
to match the gaming X model from MSI
that said you can also overclock the
msi gt80 gaming X as well and that will
extract around 6% more performance so
the GTX 1080 gaming X currently costs
five hundred and seventy dollars us
while the GTX 1070 ti gaming is priced
at four hundred and ninety dollars us
both are well over the MSRP but let's
ignore that fact for now GPU pricing is
inflated across the board
this means the 1080 costs 16% more and
with both custom overclocked to the 1080
would be around six percent faster so
the 1072 is certainly better value just
not world's better looking at the MSRP
the 1080 costs 11 percent more than the
1070 ti so under normal market
conditions the 1070 Ti is a lot less
exciting it has to be said what the 1070
Ti does do and really this was its
primary mission is cover off aim DS vega
56 at the time of putting this content
together you could buy a vega 56
graphics card for four hundred and
twenty dollars us albeit a loud
reference card but still that's not a
bad buy in today's market I have to
admit picking between the msi gtx 1070
TI gaming at four hundred and fifty
dollars and a reference vega 56 card at
four hundred and twenty dollars is
actually a difficult decision had vega
56 been equipped with a twin throws a
six cooler that might have even been the
way I ended up leaning that being the
case I'm keen to test newly released
games such as
Assassin's Creed origins Wolfenstein two
the new Colossus Middle Earth shadow of
war destiny - an tonal war Warhammer -
for example to see how these two stack
up this is something you will see in my
big benchmark video that I have planned
for hopefully a few days time for now
the gtx 1070 TI looks to feel a very
small price cap basically you can save
around 50 dollars by buying the 1070 TI
over the gtx 1080 that is and when you
overclock it you can achieve tell you
what performance it's hardly anything to
gets excited about I know it doesn't
exactly redefine the market and video is
obviously hoping that by releasing this
new GPU they'll create a bit of a buzz
around their products and improve sales
and that'll tie them over till their
next major release in any case if you're
after a new 400
- $500 us graphics card you will not be
steered wrong by the gtx 1070 TI it's a
solid offering even if it's not that
exciting and well as you know do it for
this one I'll see you guys again soon
I'm your host Steve working on getting
my voice back and I will be back with
many more blue bar graphs soon
hey guys
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
