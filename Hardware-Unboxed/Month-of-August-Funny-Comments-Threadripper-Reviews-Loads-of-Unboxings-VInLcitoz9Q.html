August many funny things I spent most of
last month running benchmark after
benchmark after benchmark and I suppose
that's not that unusual but I have to
say last month it really was a slob
having been just hit with Rison three
late in July so the month prior
we were then hit with frag Ripper in
early August but damn that thing was a
lot of fun to test and before the thread
ripper dust even had a chance to settle
AMD came out swinging once again this
time with Vega though fewer punches
landed on that one in between all the
chaos there was plenty more going on
here at the harbour unbox channel so
this is the monthly recap getting the
ball rolling last month was your boy Tim
and well we did the young fella make a
big mistake and what ultimately turned
out to be a really successful video so
Tim got his hands on the asou cx30 4vq
an ultra wide monitor boasting support
for the 34 40 by 1440 resolution 100
hertz refresh and 1800 our curvature it
also packs a frameless design qi
wireless charger and an impressive three
year warranty
all of this for $750 us makes this one
of the cheapest models available
boasting this impressive array of
specifications the problem being that a
worryingly large amount of viewers
commenting on that video didn't seem to
understand that cheap is a relative term
Tim told that video a sous MX 34 V Q
cheap 100 Hertz 1440p ultrawide monitor
an appropriate title at least Tim and
myself foolishly believed before
releasing the video
a good number of commenters were
outraged that we called a $750 us
monitor cheap despite the fact that they
fail to provide any evidence of anything
cheaper mind you cheap doesn't actually
mean cheapest but even so counter
arguments were interesting for example
Jose paid just 180 dollars us for a
Korean 27-inch hundred Hertz 1440
display and that's cool probably a
pretty good deal but it's also consider
smaller works at a lower resolution and
is questionable in terms of build
quality it's also certainly not
frameless nor curved oh and it comes
with a limited one-year warranty a
questionable limited warranty at that
nino says $700 isn't cheap I was
expecting like $400 you here too here
folks $400 is the new cheap apparently
it is a relative term
then Jack swoops in with the save but
instantly take it out of context anyway
when I get my core i9 79 80 XE later
this month I'll probably go and call it
cheapen the title since it will
technically be cheap for an 18 called
processor even at the stupid $2,000
price tag I guess I'm just a bit of a
troll moving on before I continue to
look at more humorous comments we did
have a battle royale between the rise
and 7 1700 and core i7 a 78 20x this was
an application in gaming comparison and
the results were quite interesting so if
you're thinking of buy either I suggest
checking that one out Diego one top
comment on that one I have to appreciate
him sharing the love then what by 101
pointed out a serious flaw in my testing
methodology which I have since corrected
after the serious benchmarking session
it was time to relax and do a little
unboxing this time for unboxing boxes
episode 33 we had a thread ripper on
deck and it was a heap of fun overall
that really was a fun video that went
down well though I did trigger a few
people with how casual I went about the
whole thing
thankfully though I was able to set the
record straight recently with a second
thread Ripper unboxing a truly massive
CPU I'm so tempted to see if that's now
the temptation here is to go wow that's
a sexy-looking processor but it's in an
orange caddy and that's just gross so I
don't want to do my b-roll with that
gross or interesting around let's take
out don't do that I know the temptations
there you do that you're going to
trigger the whole internet people are
going to tell you that you're a moron
because you need this orange thing to
install it I don't care if you put text
on the screen saying be careful with the
orange thing don't throw it away because
it's important don't just don't take it
out there's no need then Tim was back at
it again this time rustling a few less
feathers with these one plus five
battery life test those keen on
smartphone battery life should check
this one out
Tim tested well over a does
popular phones next up we have the rise
in three ultimate gaming benchmark guys
and this was part one of a three part
series this video went down a treat you
guys really seemed to like the benchmark
method used here so I'll certainly do
more of this in the future
that said amorous wasn't too impressed I
love this comment so much I just had to
pin it and wrasses only ever made a
single comment on the channel but he
made up for the lack of quantity with
this little gem finally unsubscribed I'm
so sick of this guy he's trying to
create the perception that aim day is
worse than nvidia and intel all the time
it can be reasonable but even if he says
good stuff about AMD he always makes me
feel like he doesn't approve of what he
says i don't find him sincere damn
one minute i'm an Nvidia shield the next
minute at AMD shell and I guess if you
give it another minute probably an Intel
shill you guys really need to get
together and get on the same page thing
I really love about this level-headed
comment is the fact that 72 other people
were like yeah right on bud give that an
upvote or maybe they just uploaded it
without reading it because I pinned it
either way thanks to a morass for the
laughs shame we lost you though ever
wonder what the difference between free
sync and gsync is and how they compare
in 2017 well good because Tim put
together a 10 minute long video covering
that very topic it was a very
informative bit by Tim we also learnt in
the comment section that Shrek has
desync it must be a new technology that
we haven't heard of and disarmed scroll
thinks I look weird
well you look weird wait it was a video
with Tim alright back to some serious
business with another unboxing boxes
episode for this one though I was really
just taking a break from all the thread
Ripper testing and of course what did I
get more thread Ripper motherboards to
test it wasn't long though before I got
back up some more thread Ripper content
this time with a sexy RGB build this one
was a heap of fun and as usual I enjoyed
reading through the comments my Mac
Brian from Everett tech ear Sydney
stopped by with a few tips
he thought I was wasting far too much
time using a credit card to spread the
thermal grease the yes-man doesn't mess
around with such nonsense
anyway if colorful rainbow builds get
you excited then be sure to check that
one out finally after much hype the
thread Ripper review went live with the
1950 ex and 90
20 X and they lived up to expectations
as it stands the 1950 X is the fastest
desktop CPU on the market though that
could change later in the month as the
biggest 16 core and 18 core core I 9
parts arrived that video received over
1000 comments and we did have some
familiar faces towards the top of the
stack including Jarrod's tech gym from a
dog TV and that crazy Kiwi keV from
Tech's showdown both Jim and keV asked
if I'm switching a thread Ripper as my
main rig and the answer is yes very soon
and that's going to be an exciting
series moving on
Tim checked out the newest sous Zephyrus
and that was a really sleek looking
laptop packin a GTX 1080 and as expected
Tim really liked it despite the amazing
design and impressive hardware the price
wasn't that extreme and in fact was
cheaper than quite a few other GT X 1080
laptops so if you're in need of a gaming
laptop that packs a serious punch
check out Tim's review after that I was
back and this time with yet another
episode of unboxing boxes for this one I
got an awesome new extra no.9
motherboard an impressive GT X 1080 Ti
from our viewer and I told a rather
unusual story about my RX Vega sample
that episode was once again a heap of
fun so check it out if you haven't
already a few days later I had AMD's
Radeon Vega 56 in hand and I threw 25
games at it
testing 1080p 1440p and the 4k
resolution that one was also a blast
loads of benchmarks plenty of great
comments and Vega 56 looks ok certainly
better than Vegas 64 which I was yet to
test at the time tying ass over once
again was Tim with another high-end
gaming laptop review this time checking
out the Auris x5 v 7 it's quite a short
name for a laptop what we have here is
an overclockable gtx 1070 powered laptop
sporting a 4 kg sync enabled display but
is it any good
I don't know go watch the video and let
me know then it was once again time to
get very serious I mean what's up with
the harbour unboxed RX Vega results
there was a little bit of drama bit of
controversy from the 25 game Vega 56
review so I decided to address that with
the video and well it went surprisingly
well who would have thought I didn't
call Vega cheap so I think that's where
I kept out of trouble for the most part
putting the Vega controversy behind us
was part 2 of the rise and three
ultimate gaming benchmark guide
time we were checking out the
overclocking performance only 22
dislikes and over 1,700 likes on that
one I'll have to study it to work out
the formula of not offending people mu
EE copyright did have this to say though
blah blah blah Rison blah blah blah who
cares I mean it does have rise and three
as the first word in the title so I
reply with this sorry I don't know why
YouTube does this you would think by now
then you had to deliver their users with
content that is appropriate for them
find YouTube I'll do your job for you
then you click on this link and zap team
next up another unboxing dammit I did a
lot of these last month anyway I checked
out a new X 399 board and then walked
out on you guys and never to return and
that was met with mixed reactions in the
comment section while I was leaving you
guys hanging Tim was getting ready to
release his Corsair Void Pro headset
review we don't do many peripheral
reviews on the channel these days so
this was a change of pace for sure those
that watch the video seemed to really
enjoy it I believe Tim is still using
the void pros as we speak then finally
the last installment in the three-part
Rison 3 ultimate benchmark guide series
this time we checked out is it worth
upgrading Rison 3 from the core i5 2500
K or FX 83-70 CPUs some pretty shocking
results in that one I have to say
definitely worth checking out if you're
rocking an older generation CPU and
thinking of upgrading while I was
working on the last few videos we've
talked about I was also slowly
benchmarking my way through this one boy
oh boy was it a grind so for this video
we have not 25 games not 30 games but
for some unexplainable reason 32 games I
have no idea what I was thinking there
really anyway here we have the results
for both the air and liquid cooled
versions of Vega 64 along with Vega 56
and a heap of other relevant cards in 32
games a big things to appleton McCool
for creating the video index on this one
I honestly didn't have the energy to get
it done
after that mega benchmark session I
decided to relax a little bit and play
the new f1 2017 video game while I was
at it I tried a few different hardware
configurations and ended up doing a
quick benchmark showdown between Vega 56
and the gtx 1070 if you're an f1 race
fan I suggest checking it out then
finally after months and months of
planning it was time to announce the new
upgrade my PC plea series and I was
super excited to let you guys know about
it
the announcement video did very well and
generated over 800 submissions
many of which were very good if you
missed that video please go check it out
the more people we can get involved in
this series the better on that note
please be aware submissions are only
open to a few select regions for now but
of course anyone can watch the series
and by voting you can go in the running
to win global giveaways each week with
some pretty awesome prizes I was a bit
disappointed how many people said they
downloaded that series because it wasn't
in there
region it's really disappointing to
learn that's the mentality of some of
the sub-base I really didn't think you
guys would do this I mean we're paying
for all of this out of our own back
pocket and of course we want to expand
the series globally it's just very
difficult and costly to do so once we
start to see a return on investment we
will indeed expand the series for now
though we do appreciate the support so
many of you have shown and will continue
to work hard to make the series bigger
and better for everyone while everyone
was getting their upgrade my PC please
submissions ready I decided to play
around with destiny - and crater what
does it take to play episode this time I
was targeting 1440p gameplay with at
least 60 FPS and it turns out the game
is quite easy to run even on mid-range
hardware so that was a nice discovery
then it was time for some serious
destiny - benchmarking so I took 30 GPUs
and threw them at the game testing tiny
peak 1440p and the 4k resolutions this
one was a heap of work but it was really
well received and I do really appreciate
all the support and amazing feedback you
guys gave it's videos like these that I
get to appreciate just how awesome the
hardware unboxed fan base is well that
does it for last month 25 videos in
total though it was technically 26 but
for reasons I've already discussed on
the channel I did pull down at my Vega
pricing video I'm still waiting to see
how that one plays out for now but yeah
fan out demand still heavily outweighing
the supply and HBM to memory pricing is
becoming a real concern as well so yeah
be interesting to see how things look
later in the year anyway as always a
really big thank you to everyone who
tuned in last month watched a lot of
videos and showed their support I really
do appreciate all of you I'm your host
Steve see you again soon guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
