i'm your host Matt and today we're going
to be taking a look at samsung's new 950
pro 512 gigabyte PCIe SSD consumers will
s salivating earlier this year when
Samsung's OEM only SM 951 nvme was able
to boost speeds in excess of 2,000 150
megabytes per second reads and fifteen
hundred megabytes per second right it
was possible to get this amazing piece
of technology from certain distributors
however the 512 gigabyte model would run
you over four hundred dollars ever since
we've been waiting for a more affordable
mainstream model and now it's here
introducing samsung's 950 pro series
available in either 256 kilobytes or 512
gigabyte capacities the 950 series is
made exclusively in the m2 2280 form
factor and both speeds of up to 2.5
gigabytes per second sequential read and
1.5 gigabytes per second bright indeed
making it faster than the SM 951 nvme as
well as being more affordable three
hundred and fifty dollars for the 512
gigabyte model this more affordable
price tag whoever still renders the 950
pro models the higher end of the market
as it should be the 512 gigabyte model
works out to be sixty eight cents per
gigabyte and the 256 gigabyte model
works out to be 74 cents per gigabyte
the 950 pro features the same ub x3 call
controller found in the sm 951 and
therefore possesses native PCIe and nvm
air support the controller has also been
paired with Samsung's 3d v-nand an
upgraded version of that which was
featured on the 850 pro series now let's
take a look at the claim speeds the 512
gigabyte model is faster boasting a
sequential read speed of 2.5 gigabytes
per second and write speed of 1.5
gigabytes per second the 256 gigabyte
model is slower although a hesitate to
even mention the word slow around the
950 Pro Series as it still claims a read
speed of 2.2 gigabytes per second and a
riot speed of nine hundred megabyte
and Samsung is backing the 950 pro
series with a 5-year limited warranty
with the limitation being how much data
can be written the 256 gigabyte model is
covered for 200 terabytes written while
the larger 512 gigabyte model is covered
for 400 terabytes written as an added
layer of protection the 950 pro series
features dynamic thermal throttling
protection technology which monitors the
driest temperature and is able to
automatically cool it down when it
reaches a certain threshold as well as
smart technology self-monitoring
analysis and reporting technology which
tracks the health status of the SSD to
anticipate failures and warn users
looking at the sequential performance we
see that the 950 Pro is able to hit new
highs delivering around 200 megabytes
per second more performance in the read
and write tests when compared to the
intel SSD 750 series and anywhere from
three to five times the performance of
the 850 probe the 950 pro approved very
fast once again in the 4k test though
it's worth pointing out that while it
was slightly faster than the Intel 750
series when measuring read performance
was a good bit slower in the right test
this time using a sssd benchmark we find
that the 950 Pro is slower than the
intel SSD 750 series when comparing
sequential read performance despite
being faster when comparing the right
performance here the 950 Pro is able to
slightly better the performance of the
SM 951 nvme making much faster than the
intel SSD 750 series that said it was
around 30 megabytes per second slower
than the intel SSD 750 series when
comparing 4k write performance the 950
Pro blitz the ISO copy benchmark with a
staggering throughput of 1.7 gigabytes
per second making is 300 megabytes per
second faster than the intel SSD 750
series the 950 Pro was again very fast
delivering 921 megabytes per second in
the program copy test making much faster
than not just the sm5 while MDMA but
also the 750 series the last d
benchmark copy test focuses on game data
performance and here the 950 pro again
dominates
throughput of 1.5 gigabytes per second
compared to the 750 series 1.1 gigabytes
per second it's almost humorous how slow
these PCI Express SSDs make the 850 pro
look the 950 pro is able to slightly
improve on the SM 95 ones result with
131 megabytes per second making it quite
a bit faster than the 750 series and 850
pro this time the 950 pro is able to
improve on the SM 95 ones result quite a
bit that when doing so it's just a few
megabytes per second faster than the 750
series here the 950 pro dominated the
video editing test with 756 megabytes
per second making it much faster than
the SM 951 and more than twice as fast
as the 750 series the 950 pro is
samsung's new flagship and given the
performance we've seen it's very easy to
see why that said while the 950 pro will
take care of the high-end power users it
isn't going to be a replacement for the
850 Pro the current pricing certainly
reflects this as consumers can expect to
pay around fifty percent more when
compared to the a50 pro series which is
still one of the top performing consumer
SSDs this 512 gigabyte model that we
tested might be pricey at three hundred
fifty dollars but it's a bargain when
compared to the intel ssds 750 series
400 gigabyte model which until recently
cost almost one dollar per gigabyte with
the arrival of the 950 pro series intel
were forced to reevaluate their pricing
structure for the 750 series and as such
the 400 gigabyte model has been heavily
discounted to just three hundred dollars
despite the large price cup we're still
much prefer the 950 pro series it's not
only faster but also better value even
it's $300 dssc 750 400 gigabytes still
comes at a cost of 75 cents per gigabyte
whereas the 950 pro 512 gigabyte model
costs almost ten percent less at
sixty-eight cents per gigabyte making it
the better value option that said the
intel SSD 750 series does have the
advantage of greater compatibility as it
is available in either a two and a half
inch model using the SF f8 639 connector
or as a half-height PCI expansion card
make it can
with any system offering a pci-express
times for slot or larger the intel ssds
also had the advantage of better cooling
which avoids any nasty throttling under
heavy load they can also offer larger
capacities as they aren't constrained by
the m2 size limitations that said the
950 pro only features NAND flash on the
top side of the PCB this means a one
terabyte model should be possible
although thermal throttling could become
a real issue with such a design still
despite all that we much prefer the 950
Pro and it's neat little m2 package as
an enthusiast it's hard not to get
excited about an SSD that can sustain
1.7 gigabytes per second in the copy
test the 950 pro series might be a
little pricey but enthusiasts will no
doubt be more than willing to cough up
the dough they'll be rewarded for doing
