Steve here once again and as you can see
the build is now done at least for now
anyway it'll no doubt continue to a
change in evolve over time but for now
at least it's done if you missed the
first video of the previous video in
this series I talked about all the
components there in this build I won't
go over all of that again and then I
installed things like the radiators the
reservoirs the water blocks pumps and
all that stuff but since then I've been
busy measuring cutting heating and
bending ptg tubing to connect it all up
and there were a few modifications made
along the way so I'll cover those in
this video but for those of you hoping
to see any kind of benchmark results
temperatures and all that kind of stuff
I won't be covering that in this video
this is just about finishing off the
build process so if you missed the
previous video I do run into a few
issues there one such issue was the top
420 millimeter radiator which could only
be installed with two of the three 140
millimeter fans which was disappointing
and kind of sport the look of the build
and it seemed plenty of you agreed that
the missing fan wasn't really a
compromise worth making but with no
alternative options available I was kind
of stuck on that one in the end I just
couldn't take it anymore so I decided to
channel my inner mater and get a bit
creative and while I was happy with the
end result I did regret it for a good
hour or so while I was carrying out the
mod so the problem is the telescoping
trays they're just not flexible for the
top mounted radiator it's basically a
420 millimeter a radiator template and
it just locks you into that position
there's no wriggle room at all you can't
move it a little bit left or a little
bit right it is fixed into the position
that you saw in the previous video and
this meant that I couldn't just move it
back so it would avoid hitting the
hitting the fittings up here
so yeah I've had to do some
modifications
therefore my only option was to remove
the top telescoping tray as well as the
telescoping arms and then jerry-rigged
the radiator into the top of the case
and it turns out using this
that I could have installed two
radiators side-by-side if I really
wanted to anyway the goal here was to
fit the 420 millimeter radiator with all
three 140 millimeter fans and with my
modifications this was now possible and
boy does it look much better so what was
involved in these modifications quite a
bit actually had I done this before I
installed everything it would have been
a hell of a lot easier significantly
faster process but because I'd already
installed the front mounted radiators
with all 16 fans and then down all the
cable management for the 32 cables
associated to said fans I wasn't really
keen on undoing over an hour's worth of
very painful work but this was a problem
because it meant that the top
telescoping arms or cabinet drawer
runners whatever you want to call them
removing them was extremely difficult
getting the one at the far end wasn't
really a problem getting this one here
was a big problem because to do that
properly you really need to remove all
this stuff as well and as I said I
wasn't willing to under hours worth of
work so I had to basically get a pair of
long nose pliers wedge at that gap there
sort of force that out a bit stick him
in there and undo the screws using long
nose pliers in what was about a 10
millimeter gap so I was doing about a
quarter turn at a time and it took me
roughly 10 minutes to undo each of the
two screws anyway the process was
extremely painful but it did manage to
get a bit worse once I realized that I
had to undo another four screws two of
which were extremely difficult to get it
because they're above the radiators here
and I didn't have a screwdriver that
would fit in that gap even my shortest
one just wouldn't
so again long nose pliers quarter turn
at a time and I undid those two screws
which allowed me to take the top
aluminium and glass panel off and then
by doing that I could then drill some
custom holes in what was left of the top
panel to mount the top radiator which
you now see up here with all three 140
millimeter fans installed so I was very
happy with that with that sorted it was
time to spend a few hours working on the
tubes and work at how I was going to run
everything in the case with two CPU
blocks
two separate GPUs two reservoirs two
pumps and three radiators there was
plenty to do that said I'm not bragging
or anything but this thing was a
one-take wonder I didn't read to a
single Bend there certainly could be one
or two there that could have been done a
bit better but I am under the pump on
this one as I've got some GeForce r-tx
testing to do so that being the case
this is no time to try and get all the
bends perfect I figured that next time I
do a coolant flush I could take a crack
at perfecting a few of these runs but
for now this more than serves the
purpose once all the truths were
connected up I began to fill the
reservoirs with the coolant and in the
end each took two liters of fluid I then
connected the pumps to an external power
supply so a third power supply not one
of the two corsair units that are in
their case and I started my leak testing
as usual I focused my attention on the
water blocks because that's where most
of the damage by a leak or at least most
of the mess can occur if you are
unfortunate enough to have a leak
thankfully for me no leaks so I
continued to top-up those to be
reservoirs there and I kept an eye on
all the fittings and things around that
area and 20 minutes later it all
appeared to be good but then I did
notice a red puddle on the desk just at
the bottom of the KC it started coming
yeah and yeah I went into full-blown
panic mode started checking everything
and couldn't work out where the leak was
thankfully the VGA blocks were fine
because it's just a nightmare if it
leaks down the back of those and goes
over the PCB and everything else all the
CPU blocks were fine some like okay
probably not as bad as I thought and
anyway I couldn't find it was looking
everywhere turns out it was the adapters
or one of the adapters anyway in
particular on the reservoirs so it just
wasn't done up tight enough it was done
as tight as I could do it by hand so I
wasn't sure if you had tightening up a
bit more with a tool would help or if I
was gonna have to drain all the liquid
out try and work out what was wrong
whether the right the washer had been
crushed that can happen but as I said I
only did it up finger tight and as tight
as I could by hand anyway and normally
that means they're okay if you use tools
you can crush them and then they fail
but anyway it
now that a my long nose plyers came to
the rescue once again I put him on there
it was like not even a half turn the
leak stopped I noticed the other one
that with the clear liquid that was just
dripping ever so slightly gave that
another half turn that stopped that
cleaned it all up dude all that got rid
of all their residue and all that so I
could do my leak testing again and now
it's fine it's been a week since then so
I'm pretty confident that it's solved
but I'm not too sure what is going on
there because all the other fittings not
a problem I just did them up yeah with
my hands no problems at all and it's
just the two feedings the I think
they're 45 degree angle feedings that I
used off the Ortz the outlet of the
radiators and both of them didn't seal
very well at all they had to be that
super super tight to avoid bleeding
basically so not sure what the goal is
there but that was the only problem I
ran into and thankfully my long nose
pliers were able to solve that one for
me with that too much fuss
anyway crisis over I got on with the
build and after a day of further leak
testing the two loops were rock-solid
and I moved on to the all-important RGB
lighting I have 20 Corsair ml series
fans to configure three water blocks and
a number of course our lighting node pro
light strips since this is a set piece I
don't really want flashing lights and a
lot nonsense so I've gone with a simple
blue and red static theme the plan was
to eventually die the clear water blue
but I'm starting to think that I should
potentially run both loops with clear
liquid that way I can change the color
scheme at any time using the RGB
lighting anyway not sure how it will
change over the next few months but I do
have a few ideas for now all the ml fans
have been set to blue and solve all the
CPU and GPU blocks then the Corsair
Vengeance / RGB memory has been set to
red and the LED light strips have also
been set to red and I think it all looks
pretty awesome have to admit the build
ended up being a lot more enjoyable than
I initially thought it might be at first
I was kind of regretting all the RGB
lighting as the wiring was just insane
but it did ultimately end up being a lot
of fun
the course a 1008 is about as perfect a
platform as you can get for a jewel
system with dual loop cooling
having said that though there are a
number of things I would like to see
change or improve in the next version
but overall still a very epic case so my
list of things that needs to be
addressed with course as 1000d obviously
the first thing is the top radiator tray
that calls me the most problems and I
think the solutions simple they just
need to use the method that was used in
the 500d much more simplistic design
more flexible cheaper to implement so I
think that's the way to go another big
issue I ran into that really annoyed me
it was the ATX power supply enclosure
down here you can't access the ATX power
supply from the back of the case at
least not very easily my hands certainly
can't and towards the end of the build I
realized I needed a few more of those
awful for pin molex connectors and I
couldn't connect them to the ATX power
supply because I couldn't get in there
and you might think well how do you get
to the ATX power supply the answer is
you have to remove this entire shroud
from this side and of course there's now
an ATX sorry an ITX build on top of that
it's the 87 or okay reg so I would have
to have to completely bleed the clear
liquid loop I would then have to undo
all the piping I would then have to
remove the graphics card I'd have to
remove the motherboard basically
disassemble the entire ITX rig to
connect a few more cables to the ATX
power supply and in such a massive case
that's just unacceptable and a huge huge
design flaw I don't know how that one
happened it's this should be ample room
at the back to get in there and then
slide the SFX power supply out then the
ATX power supply touch the cables you
need and put them both back in but
unfortunately that is not an option then
the next thing on my wish list for the
1000 eversion 2 would be to make this
top panel removable as you see I haven't
fixed mine back into place yet doing so
would actually be very difficult so I'm
gonna come up with some other way to
secure that there or just leave it
sitting there for now because doing
those two screws underneath is a
complete nightmare but it makes the case
so much easier to work with if you have
top access so it's kind of crazy to me
that edging
system to make that removable because
just table management at the top there
things like that are a lot easier when
you can just come in from the top and
dual that I found that great for
installing the light strips and all that
sort of stuff and really all they need
to do to make this easy to access easy
remove is make the glass an aluminium or
one-piece deal stick those two together
then make a tab here that you push them
into clips them in it sits down and then
at the back there's a tab with a couple
of screws you screw them in top panel is
easily removable and so that's something
they definitely need to do for the next
revision making the front panel
removable would also be ideal as well
but you can get away with that one a bit
more easily I also think it'd be quite
cool to make it possible to mount three
and a half inch drives in the top of the
case are those loads of spare room there
and by making the top panel removable
this section the case is very easy to
access everything else is great though
at the ability to install massive front
mounted radiators is great the cable
management basement on the backside is
also excellent the plethora of fan
mounting locations is great and the i/o
panel is also very nice in my opinion
the case looks good and the build
quality is second to none even the price
isn't bad five hundred dollars u.s. or
seven hundred dollars aussie for a case
of this size and quality in my opinion
is very reasonable so there's just a few
things that i would like to see address
to make this the ultimate super tower
about particularly hard things for
corsair to do and they aren't expensive
a lot of them would probably end up
being cost saving things so i really
hope they can do that but anyway for now
that concludes the build portion of this
video i thought i might try something a
bit different for this one and that is
to read the comments from the previous
build video which was about a week ago
there's some good comments on there some
interesting things and some stuff that i
thought i could address so if you're
interested in that stick around but if
not i hope you enjoyed the build and
i'll catch you again next time first
questions from donald steve looks like a
dwarf beside that beautiful humongous
beast yes yes i do it's it's a
ridiculous case but that's kind of the
point though isn't it next question is
from our co-ed who said that right
apologies if I didn't just one question
how the hell do you lift to that it's so
huge or it looks so huge sorry
well not easily basically I suppose the
solution would be to involve a few
friends in the process of moving this
beast because yeah it's just
ridiculously heavy complete the build
tipped the scales at 61 in kilograms
I myself weigh about 90 kilograms so I
can pick it up and move it around the
office but I wouldn't be taking it to
too many LAN parties next questions from
Steve please tell me you're going to use
purple fluid and that would be a sexy as
hell you're right probably would be and
at some point we might even find out for
now it's the red and clear I was
thinking of going fully clear you know
for transparency as in video would say
but yeah we'll have to see what happens
in the future next one's from Francisco
this thing is huge but cannot run Crysis
and either be one of those in there well
it can very easily play two copies of
Crysis simultaneously as there are two
systems in this rig and the 2950 axe can
probably play a few copies of Christ at
the same time though the GTX 1080
graphics card probably wouldn't love
that next one's from Omar I think it is
I'd drill some holes at the top and put
the radiator three centimeter closer to
the rear and that was exactly what I
wanted to do unfortunately as I said
with the standard gear in the case that
simply wasn't possible because your fans
would be blocked by the the template
thing that we had I should grab that
actually one second I'll get it so here
is what was in the top of the case and
as you can see if we drill some holes
back here and shift the radiator back
well certainly possible far from ideal
because you'd really want to have to cut
all this out that's a lot of messing
around for what doesn't really solve the
problem that well if you're going to go
to all that time and effort you just end
up doing what I've altered ended up
doing but yeah good idea it sounds easy
enough just isn't really possible so
you'd have to end up doing what I did
and an hour or so later those few holes
ended up getting drilled okay next
question sorry I'm not gonna butcher the
hell out of your name on this one so
apologies I am a very simple man
why would you pair the i7 with the Vega
GPU and the AMD CPU with the NVIDIA GPU
a fair enough question there was quite a
few questions very similar to that one
and the plan was to do exactly that
installed the Vega 64 card or with the
thread Ripper CPU put the AMD gear
together and then do an Intel in-video
combo for the gaming system but then I
realized you wouldn't see this beautiful
RGB block the GeForce block isn't RGB ek
didn't send the RGB version that block
for whatever reason maybe they didn't
have it in stock I don't know I didn't I
was very happy with what they did since
I wasn't gonna say ASCII and why they
didn't send particular bits of hardware
very place with what they sent me and
the Radeon block is certainly the more
showy block and since this is just a
display system as I've said it's a set
piece I wanted the best looking block on
show so that's why you've got the Vega
block there it's not going to be used as
a system anyway as I've said many times
it is just a set piece so it doesn't
really matter what's paired with what
because unfortunately it won't be used
for gaming or anything like that and
that sounds like a shame and a waste of
hardware but it's a set piece makes the
set look a bit more interesting for
people watching their videos and it
didn't cost me anything because
companies involved okay next question is
from just the facts ma'am I don't know
why the comments are so tiny on my phone
it's like sighs microphone anyway
wow that thing it makes you look like a
dwarf yes I'm a normal-sized person but
I realize this does make me look like a
dwarf
definitely wins the most ridiculous
ridiculously sized PC award yeah it it
probably would if there was such a
category I think Corsair would take that
as a sort of a mission accomplished
I'd say that's what they set out to
achieve the most ridiculously sized PC
case voila
Daniel says really wish you guys would
do a livestream for this build it would
be just nice to watch in slow pace and
you might get a lot of donation in super
chat try it sometime just make sure it's
a good build and I budget low end
another budget low end ones I find more
interesting sometimes
anyway really not I like the idea
probably not appropriate for a build
like this it's the kind of stuff we
would this kind of stuff we would do for
patreon members because it'd be like a
20-minute stream here half hour there
hour there because I didn't just sit
here and do this in one go I'd be just
sitting on my backside working on this
for days on end because it was well
that's over a day anyway probably if I
hit it in one big go and you sort of get
a bit I do anyway I can benchmark for
days on end no problem but doing this
kind of stuff I don't know I enjoy it
but it's not something I could really do
a lot of I don't know yeah okay anyway I
very much enjoyed the build and I do
plan to do livestream builds on the
channel I think Tim's done before Tim
and I were gonna do like a build off at
his place and we will do that so we're
gonna build him a new desk so it will
support two builds and yet you'll see
that on the channel in the future just
bit more professional than what this
would have been this was just a bit of
messing around here and there so
hopefully that answers that one alright
next questions from Bert soon building a
PC will be a job for plumbers only now
well you've got the all-in-one liquid
coolers they're very easy to install and
stuff like that but yeah water cooling
isn't really it's not rocket science
it's certainly not that difficult not as
difficult as some people make out I
suppose it depends on you know if you're
good with your hands hands I've I find
it very simple I was I did my first hard
shoe build about two years ago now and
I'd heard nothing but horror stories
about how difficult it was but we had
the opportunity I when I thought why not
and I was shocked by how simple it was
but I've done actual plumbing around the
house and stuff like that I kind of the
same sort of you don't want leaks in
either situation so I suppose they're
similar in that sense and they both have
a liquid running through the the pipes
or tubes yeah not not super difficult
but if you wanted to get into it and you
were concerned about how difficult it is
just start with soft tubing that you can
even buy kits so it has all the bits you
need to have to try and work out what
you need and that's a really good place
to start I think I started with a soft
tube kit and they're dead easy can't
really mess them up
super
super-easy and then once you've you know
evolved from that maybe set up your own
custom rig and still use soft tubing but
work out what you need and like kind of
stuff and maybe incorporates and
incorporate some VGA box and go from
there and then eventually get to the
hard juban so how'd you being though
really I don't know it's not something I
would probably run in my own computer my
personal computer unless I was willing
to put a lot of time and effort into the
maintenance because it can get a bit
like that also I personally like to
upgrade and change and mess around with
my PC and this doesn't really allow for
that it's kind of like build the PC it
is what it is and you want to go more
than a year ideally without having a
change everything but maybe some people
do like bending the pipes and changing
it constantly so it depends what you
enjoy doing anyway I'm rattling on a bit
hopefully I not even sure what your
question was
anyway you don't need to be a plumber to
build your own PC like this certainly
not next questions from fishmonger I was
going to comment on the impressive
Photoshop skills on the thumbnail and
then I watched the video it is a bit
like that hard to believe this case is
real basically what he's saying in the
last video the thumbnail was a picture
of the case with me sitting next to it I
don't know giving the thumbs up or doing
something and it looked absolutely
ridiculous because it looks absolutely
ridiculous as you can currently see so
not photoshopped this is really
ridiculous next questions for Joshua so
your Mini ITX system isn't probably
faster than the real system in gaming
because Vegas 64 versus 1080
they'd be pretty much the same the GTX
1080 of Vegas 64 neck-and-neck I mean
the 1080 comes out a little bit on top
depending on the spread of games overall
it is a little bit faster but it doesn't
exactly murder Vegas 64 so they're I
would say they're close enough in terms
of gaming performance the only 7rk is
obviously a better gaming CPU so I think
that's where you're hinting at but I
paired it with what's arguably the
slower graphics card there's very little
in it if you play it 1440p again it
doesn't really even matter between the
two CPUs you're gonna see a very similar
result 4k they will be identical but
yeah u7 okay is the better gaming CPU
I'm not trying to say it's not but it's
a set pace so it doesn't really matter
but if you were to use this as a
streaming PC it would be pretty awesome
because you'd have the 21 50 X to do
your encode your your live stream and
then you could just game on the 87 okay
and it will be in one big rig so it's
kind of like the ultimate streamers
dream stream dream Cisco says one of
your front fans is 90 degrees off so
it's this fan yeah so all of them have
got the correct or they're the correct
way around one of them is just on its
side it doesn't really matter that's
certainly how it's staying I'm not gonna
change it now but yeah I did notice that
as well when I built it I was like yeah
yeah it'll be fine next question is from
Martin why does it look like the top
radiator could be moved back or left
toward the i/o away from the front
radiator okay
well I've kind of covered that it just
because of the because of that being
fixed in a place you can't do it so yeah
that one's being covered but yeah it's
just you to Corsairs design I wish it
had it been a bit more flexible next one
is from Jocko
but can it run crisis are you'll beaten
the punch by almost one week on that
question mate parasite atom 666 says
dude your PC looks like it's gonna beat
you up for your lunch money well if this
thing fell on you it would be taking
much more than just your lunch money
okay the one you don't see says looks
like a competitor to skunk works on Jays
two cents Channel who skunk works I have
to google that one after the video
question here from I'm gonna call you
lamb hope that's okay
lamb says lamb says lionesses one is
better not sure what to say to that one
yeah I'm I'm pretty sure lioness really
built his one okay next up we have ke
I'm not gonna bother sorry again
simpleton this cooling is beyond
overkill yes yes it is okay next
question is from Mobius it's a bit of a
long one here in extremely small font so
bear with me is push-pull really
necessary for anyone building one of
these for practicality you could make
more room for activities okay I get the
feeling that this case is largely only
used as a showpiece what gave you that
feeling in most instances though and
then it keeps going on okay well yes it
is overkill push-pull isn't necessary
I said multiple times in that video that
it is overkill the build is ridiculous
that is the point and I also said
multiple times that is a set piece so it
isn't meant to be for any kind of
practical application techride says
looks like a great case for a land party
well I have to agree it's perfect
it's a two-in-one system so you and your
hundred kilo beefcake mate can carry it
to basically any LAN party and you could
quite literally crush your opponents
with it okay next question again sorry
I'm gonna skip the name on this one the
CPU seems really weak for a $7,500
machine it looks really nice but the
specs seem too weak and the cooling is
overkill yes why don't you use a 79 80
XE that's better than a 29 50 X in
everyway or $500 more and it's possible
to get an epic 32 core CPU or I could
just use the 2990 WX if I wanted to do
that 128 gig of ram sure 1080 TI sure
this looks more like building a PC for
fun
more than building a PC for workstation
job well anyway the comment does go on
I'm just going to stop it there but yes
this is much more like building a PC for
fun because that's what I did it as I
said many many many times in that video
this is a set piece so I wasn't it's not
a build guide it's a set piece that's
gonna sit here and where it was sitting
previously I've just jazzed it up a bit
see me featured in every video so anyway
it'll be interesting to see how many
people in the comments section of this
video say the Cooling's overkill and the
specs don't make sense or something
along those lines anyway but thank you
for your question or your comment thank
you
Oscar said pipes coolers what is this an
oven well I don't know about you but if
you stick your head in an oven you're
probably not gonna see too many pipes or
coolers so don't think this is an oven
Damian says why is there an ITX 8700 k
in there - I I don't know I guess
because Ken okay big said I I remember
this comment I thought poor people like
AMD because it's cheaper and not much
worse wTF is this then I actually reply
to that comment I replied with that's
odd and at this point I have to say I
have no comment ok next time Tony that's
one huge number crunching beast you're
building looks beautiful already I can't
wait for you to get it complete fill it
up and running PS are you sure the table
is able to handle all the weight you're
adding well first of all thank you very
much I hope you approve of the final
product and enjoyed the build the table
has been checked by an engineer and been
given the all-clear so hopefully when I
move that over to here we're all good
next questions from streamline you bet I
hope that thing never leaks otherwise
you're going to flood your entire house
I have to say that it's probably a
genuine concern at this point which is
well I'm probably more worried about
killing the components in it but there's
a lot of liquid in there if you came in
and it's almost impossible for it to all
leak out so anyway it's still a funny
comment yes there is quite a lot of
liquid that could come out and it would
certainly spoil my day if I walked in
here and half my floor was covered in
coolant now we have just the facts ma'am
back and this time they've commented and
you would need some power tools
I love the channel but sometimes you've
got a troll a bit I can't even remember
what the previous comment was but I
recognized the name anyway I assume that
was meant to be a reply to an earlier
comment perhaps the only read or another
one but if you're going to troll it
probably would be best to where I can
have the replies function works first
Paul says I'd be interested with the
total cost of the build will be well
Paul the cost of the total build was in
the title of the previous video it was
$7,500 us it would accumulate quite a
bit of
if you added a few more graphics cards
and things of that nature storage and
whatnot but yeah as it is the base bill
was seven and a half thousand u.s. TSA
trash says I wonder how noisy all these
fans will be it's still really cool the
electrical bill must be a big problem
basically to answer the first part of
your question it's extremely quiet the
fans only need to write like 200 rpm
maybe not even that to keep everything
chilly as cool as it's going to get so
you're running them and a much ladder up
here to make a whole heap of racket
wouldn't make too much difference
because there's just a huge amount of
airflow and a lot of radiator so yeah
works out quite well we says brilliant
build I thought it was going to be for a
client of yours but it's a showpiece
wish that much money I wish I had that
much money to spend on marketing well
first of all I'm not professional enough
to have any actual real clients the good
news is though it didn't cost me a
single dollar because youtubers that run
tech channels get everything for free
and it's really easy and a really cushy
life okay I'm taking the piss a bit too
much there but yes I didn't pay for any
of it it was all technically free
depending on how you define the word
free companies like Nvidia AMD Intel MSI
ek they all sent their hardware to me
for free luckily put in this system
because this system is going to be on
display in every video but yeah it was a
lot of work to make it happen and I
don't really get any personal benefit
from it apart from the fact that it
looks nice and hopefully is a cool set
piece for you guys to look at ok the
next one is from ranch the name is it
even logical I don't know how is it not
logical hmmm trying to explain this to
all of you guys but I'll do it anyway it
has a core i7 87 ok CPU which is based
on the coffee like architecture pretty
commonly known and then we have a thread
Ripper CPU so the coffee like CPU is
meant to be for the gaming portion the
build the third Ripper CPU was meant to
be for the productivity portion to build
so you sort of get the best of both
worlds a core heavy CPU and a really low
latency awesome gaming CPU so
the genius behind the name was I took
the coffee from coffee lake and then the
Ripper from thread Ripper and then I put
coffee in front of Ripper and that gave
us coffee Ripper so hopefully now that
I've explained that it is a little bit
more a little more logical okay last
question is from Lucien
that's his meaning this is a joke this
isn't a serious comment he's saying
you're copying Paul's build aren't you
question mark smiley face plagiarism
smiley face with many mouths so yes very
very funny I do really enjoy Paul's work
and I enjoy watching his content i watch
a fair bit of it and when I get time and
he's a real he's a really nice guy
chilled out guy just really enjoyable to
watch really relaxing to watch so you
enjoy Paul's work a lot and he did do a
1000d build he took the easy way out and
did some soft troubiing now as it
actually looks really good to practice I
think he's using it as a test system
which is why the soft tubing makes a
hell of a lot of sense in any case it's
a really cool-looking build he goes
through the process really well so I'll
Chuck a link to that one in the video
description and I think that is a good
point to wrap this video go watch Paul's
video now but if you did like this video
hit the like button and if you have any
comments or suggestions about the build
let me know let me know what you think
about my radiator hack and just the
build in general love hearing from you
guys and let me know feel life to this
little comment but at the end I'm not
gonna do a whole lot but for these kind
of videos I think it was kind of good to
look back at the previous video in the
series anyway before I waffle on any
longer I am your host Steve and I'll see
you next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
