already time to update our top 5 best
GPU picks after your long wait I finally
updated this series late last year but
in just a few short months I've needed
to make some changes thanks to the
arrival of the GTX 1662 I am RTX 2060
though I've also made a few other
changes and a few other price ranges
anyway as usual we do have five
categories covering numerous price
ranges so there will be something for
everyone so that waste any more time and
let's get into it first up we have the
best entry-level GPU and a few months
ago I went with the Radeon rx 550 / the
GeForce GT 1030 for those looking at
spending no more than $1 u.s. I still
highly recommend going with the rx 550
however if you can increase the budget
by just $25 you can now land the rx 560
and I strongly suggest this as the way
you go I suppose if you can
for starters you get twice as much of
VRAM and today the difference between 2
gigabytes and 4 gigabytes can be quite
significant so that alone really helps
to justify the 30% price increase the
really big draw card here though is the
fact that you're getting over 50% more
performance and in games such as Metro
Exodus that's the difference between
unplayable and very player performance
at 1080p using medium quality settings
then over on the Green Team the cheapest
gtx 1050 graphics cards they've started
120 dollars and again they only come
with a measly 2 gigabyte vram buffer so
I'd recommend avoiding those at all
costs then the 4 gigabyte versions they
cost upwards of a things about 150
dollars most are up around $180 which is
absurd in my opinion especially when you
consider and
pick yes our pick here is still the RX
570 which is selling for as low as 130
dollars u.s. which is just amazing right
now both as rock and power color have
130 dollar models on offer and there are
plenty of options selling between 140
and 150 dollars which is still a really
great price for example the ROG Strix
version from a soos that can be had for
a hundred and fifty dollars us I
remember the RX 570 still comes with two
free games with your choice currently
from I think it's Resident Evil 2 Devil
May Cry 5 and the division 2 so you can
pick two of those games seems pretty
good to me basically it boils down to
this if you plan on getting any two of
those games over the next few months
you're virtually getting the graphics
card for free
so that's a pretty amazing deal right
there of course this pick could change
next month is the gtx 1650 is rumored to
become available at $180 us but of
course what to evaluate that product
once it's released
gamer's looking to spend between 200 and
300 dollars also have a few options to
choose from
there's the GeForce GTX 1060 in either
the three gigabyte or six gigabyte
variant the Radeon rx 580 and now the
GeForce GTX 16 60 TI
in terms of cost per frame the rx 588
gigabyte is still the best value choice
here and it was my previous pick just a
few months ago however the new GeForce
GTX 1662 I is in a completely different
class I have to be honest when it comes
to performance it delivers almost 30%
more frames on average it's also much
more efficient and therefore will run
cooler and quieter so not bad given that
it is much faster for those reasons I
suggest spending the extra $80 to get
the 16 60 TI it's far more capable at
1440p and for those seeking extreme
frame rates at 1080p it's also a much
better option
so for under $300 u.s. I would go with
the GTX 1660 TI right now
in the last update I explained how this
category has traditionally targeted the
sub $400 us price range so that scrub to
the RT X 2070 from our list are leaving
us with just Vega 56 and the gtx 1070 TI
of those two options i noted that it was
what was really a close battle but
overall we could usually find the gtx
1070 TI for a better price and i suppose
more crucially get a better quality a ib
model vega 64 in my opinion is more of
an opportunistic purchase find one on
sale for a killer price and you're in
business but for the most part the 1072
i was going to present itself as the
better value option none of that really
matters now though as you should
probably just get 90 X 2060 it's cheaper
and it offers the same level of
performance in our 36 game bench market
edged out the 1070 TI and it came in
just behind vega 64 it's also only about
10 percent slower on average when
compared to the RT x 2070 but the 27 t
cost 30% more making it well a
completely pointless product in my
opinion just a few months after release
so unless you can get vega 64 under $400
i wouldn't bother with it like I said
the are check 2060 is very similar in
terms of performance it's also much more
power efficient runs cooler and quieter
and is available in a wide range of
options making it the much better sub
$400 choice in my opinion that said if
you are willing to sacrifice a little
bit of performance the previously
mentioned sub $300 King 4 gtx 660ti is
the best value option overall
okay so you could argue about the merits
of AMD's vega 56 and 64 and I guess you
could even argue about the other stock
Radeon 7f or that way inclined but it's
really impossible to argue against the
fact that Nvidia holds the performance
crown and for those spending over $500
your best choice right now is the RT X
2080 or the Ludacris 2080 ti and since
this is the best extreme 4k gaming
option
well obviously picking the 2080 ti here
while it is true they are grossly
overpriced at $1,300 us if you want the
best of the best
well this is quite plainly it the MSRP
of the AIB models has meant to be a
thousand dollars or well it is a
thousand dollars u.s. and even at that
price I feel they're still pretty insane
but no matter how much I complain about
the price things not going to change so
the situation is what it is
they're obviously selling in big enough
volumes to enable a 30% markup
personally I'd snap up in RTX 2080 for
700 as us and then just pocket the
change for an upgrade in a year or two
but if you've got money to burn and
obviously in videos counting on a good
many of you being in that situation then
there's really no better 4k gaming
experience than what you'll receive
with the 2080 ti well there you have it
NVIDIA has continued to muscle AMD out
of the market with their churring GPUs
earlier in the year if you had $300 u.s.
or less to spend you are buying a radio
and GPU that was really a no-brainer or
at least you should have been buying an
AMD GPU today though that price range
has dropped down to $200 u.s. or less
leaving the rx 550 the 560 and the 570
as the only worthwhile buyers in my
opinion or I suppose the rx 580 if you
can get one for less than $200 the GTX
1662 I has placed a huge amount of
pressure on AMD's GPU division the level
of performance at office for under $300
just makes it one of the best value
options out there right now then with
the 1660 and 1650 rumored to be in
coming soon things are likely to get a
lot worse for AMD before they get better
and on that positive note I'm gonna end
