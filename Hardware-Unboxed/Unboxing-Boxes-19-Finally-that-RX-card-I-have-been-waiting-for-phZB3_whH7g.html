today we have another episode of
unboxing boxes forgive me if I'm a
little foggy this morning i had a big
sunday yesterday so as my dad's 60th so
we celebrated that quite well and it's
made doing this the next morning a
little more difficult than usual but
anyway the show must go on so we have
three boxes to get through today I've
got one big case box down here or at
least I hope it's well I think it's a
case box it's quite large and two other
boxes here so we'll start with this one
it looks like it's got a bit of a
blowout so hopefully everything insides
okay and we'll find out anyway of course
we're going to start an unboxing boxes
episode off with a two keyboards not one
but two and they are the looks like
cherry brand keyboards which I've
actually never seen myself personally
first and so the MX board six from
cherry and the MX board three presumably
both use the cherry switches that's
interesting i've yeah I've never
actually seen the cherry branded
keyboards before obviously just other
keyboards using their switches this
one's very heavy we'll have a look at
the three first I assume this is the
cheaper version I'll look at them we'll
check them out and then I'll do a quick
bit of research to find out pricing and
availability and stuff like that because
I honestly know absolutely nothing about
these I didn't even know that being sent
ah obviously has a detachable cable
it's not detachable from the box and
looks likes probably feet covers so
stand at a USB to cable there some
silicon pads okay so we've got some low
profile keycap see interesting okay they
are using the red cherry switches yup so
we got the fold-out feet there and they
don't come with the pads pre-installed
so your do that yourself to give it a
bit of extra grip on the desk and for
those that like to leave it leave the
keyboard laying flat on their desk is
what looks like some silicon pads here
to give it some grip but again for
whatever reason these aren't
pre-installed so that's a bit strange
not the best job but anyway good enough
for an unboxing episode so there you go
now if your lay it down flat it's
extremely sticky that's going nowhere
and with the feet up it's also pretty
sticky but not as much as the big
silicon pads so it's all plastic
construction feels like it's a
reasonably good quality and yeah those
that don't like the big tall keycaps
it's sort of like a there are sort of
somewhere between the normal size key
caps and your Chiclets I suppose
definitely a lower profile anyway and
then you've got a detachable cable so
you have to worry about the cable
breaking or anything like that because
you can just replace it easily dedicated
media keys for your volume mute button
what else we've got everything
interesting windows keys doesn't look
like there's any alternate functions or
a function button or anything like that
so it is a fairly basic layout but
interesting i'll see what the price of
that keyboard is in a moment
okay so this one looks like it's a bit
more serious so based on the little
manual here it's backlit I don't think
it's RGB but it looks like it's got
different colored zone lighting probably
check that out nice big rest rest comes
with a soft protective sort of fabric
this is looking a bit fair bit more
serious one got a braided USB to table
this time well that wrist wrist rest
feels really nice I like that a lot
that's cool oh wow it's magnetic that's
really cool so this is a steel tab here
and then it looks like we've got some
powerful magnets just in here so that's
the only point of contact as soon as
those two get close to each other they
just pull in and it's strong enough to
hold it there but obviously on your desk
it just lines it up nicely wow I really
like this thing already so we've got as
the other cool thing whoops just not to
tee off put it back together the other
cool thing about this is you can just
obviously put it down like that and if
you want to leave the rest rest there up
at the keyboard up all you do is you
just tilt it up like that so that's
that's cool or if you drag it on your
desk it comes with it so that's probably
the coolest wrist rest I've ever seen on
a keyboard and I've seen quite a few as
you might imagine it looks like the
cable is potentially detachable not sure
about that I have to read the manual on
that one I want to break it but you've
got feet on the bottom these ones have
the rubber pads installed and there's
nice cable route channels that go to the
far extremes of either side of the
keyboard so that's cool as well I'm
sniffing a bit and stuff excuse me you
guys I've got seriously bad hay fever
today huh huh which is we because it's
the coldest day we've had in a while
it's raining but anyway crew definitely
with all the alcohol he'd be dust as a
real thing anyway um nice braided cable
love the wrist rest on this thing
probably yeah I'll have to say that's
the best wrist rest size comfort design
the whole thing I've ever seen so that's
really impressive the keyboard is again
an old plastic design which is so that's
fine really it looks like it to be
reasonably easy
keep clean it's just got this is like a
silver plastic top which looks pretty
cool the black key caps black plastic
underneath this is a nice sort of
rubberized pad it's really really grippy
and it just has the MX sort of ingrained
in it over and over again an MX texture
if you will I suppose we should check
out the lighting so just as I saw in the
manual it looks like it's got just zone
lighting so its majority of the
keyboards red and then we have the
windows key the function key and the num
lock key all in blue so I don't know if
you can change that let's have a look
okay so that's the brightness level does
go quite bright well you can change the
windows key and you can turn the
lighting off if you want that's cool
it's when you turn it on and off it
fades up and fades down so that's a
pretty cool effect ok so after a quick
consult with the manual it appears like
there are no lighting effects or any
fancy stuff like that the the gaming
keyboards have which kind of makes
senses I think this is more of a
gentleman's gaming keyboard and probably
for office use and like kind of stuff
where you know the backlighting is just
a bit easier if you're working in a at
night or in a darker environment so it's
not really meant to be or odd you being
flashy and all that kind of stuff that's
a bit bit more our distinguished that's
annoying Australia the box even though
it came wrapped in this the space bar
has a little chunk taken out of it and
the lights bleeding through so that's a
bit of a shame but I mean other than
that it's a very cool looking keyboard i
really like it i'll probably replace the
white at my desktop with this and give
this a go for a while i can gently pop
out a key here again this has got the
red cherries which is the same as the
other one but yeah very very cool office
type casual gaming keyboard which i
think will end up on my office pc
because i really quite like it the wrist
rest again is just awesome i love that
thing so I can't wait to give that a
really good workout I'll just quickly
see if I can find some pricing info ok
so the Cherry MX six which is this thing
is very expensive
I'm seeing a hundred and seventy four
dollars on Amazon there are offers as
low as a hundred and forty-six but yeah
that's in u.s. dollars so that's a
seriously expensive keyboard and it
looks like I'll just check the other one
so shockingly it looks like this version
is a hundred and eighty dollars now
let's go okay it says offers from eighty
three dollars so that seems a bit more
reasonable so I'm just looking on amazon
here I don't know what availability and
Australia's like I'm assuring not good
since I've never ever seen them before
but that doesn't necessarily mean
anything okay yeah so this one is ad
dollars at newegg and I'd suspect the
same at amazon so eighty dollars for a
fairly good quality well it looks like a
good quality cable it's obviously got
genuine Cherry MX red switches it
probably comes with browns as well so
that's a reasonable price there's not
much in the way of extra features but
probably comes with a decent warranty
and yeah it looks like the the six is a
hundred and eighty us so that's that's
really expensive even though it's got
probably what I think is probably the
best wrist rest I've ever seen that's
still expensive I'll just quickly check
Ozzy pricing okay available in Australia
does seem pretty good but whether you
want to buy owns another question you're
looking at at least 270 for the board
six and most prices like a scorp tech em
wave Cpl the big guys are charging 300
Ozzy for this thing so I struggle to see
three hundred dollars with a value there
and this cheaper one isn't in Australia
but it would be over a hundred dollars
anyway looking at sort of a conversion
so yeah good keyboards but not good
prices anyway well may look at them in
more depth later right so hopefully
that's the keyboard out of the way for
this episode and on to the next box will
leave their big one for last I know
what's in this box because it had a
shipping invoice
and it's something I've been waiting for
for a while but anyway we'll get into it
and we'll talk about it when I get it
out yep awesome it's taking me long
enough guys but I finally have a radeon
r x 480 full gigabyte graphics card so i
purchased this from newegg a bit of an
experiment really I've been a bought
from newegg before but it was a really
good price that I got this for I'll
throw up some pricing information on the
screen for you but basically i got this
delivered from the US cheaper than what
i could get it for at any of the local
retailers and hopefully it's a fairly
reasonable version i'm sure it will get
the most out of the card perhaps not in
the overclocking department but
certainly out of the box sort of factory
overclocked performance should be good
so let's take a look at it it is the
power color red dragon version that
wasn't obvious enough like this point
and as we found recently with all these
sort of budget eshe kind of cards
packing the card itself and a quick
installation guide you get nothing else
in the package not that you should
really need anything else okay so it's a
decent cooler on there nice big fan it's
got a huge backplate standard
connectivity you've got three display
ports one hdmi and a DVI port but yeah
it's a pretty cool looking card the heat
sick on it looks reasonable not a huge
so interesting to see how that performs
temperature wise but yeah it was quite
cheap for the four gig models all trying
I remember exactly what I paid just
looking at the shipping invoice here
which is all in u.s. dollars so not
exactly what I paid but I just went and
checked and i paid 273 dollars delivered
for this card that's Ozzie 273 Ozzie
delivered which is pretty amazing
because when I checked on static ice 330
Ozzy was the cheapest for gigabyte RX
for Eddie listed so that's that's a
massive discount at least sixty dollars
off and that's the static ice price
isn't including shipping so you'd pay at
least ten if not twenty dollars more for
shipping as well so buying these off
newegg for Ozzy's seems like the way to
go unless
missing something but yeah I'm happy
with that price anyway for this kind of
card the only thing to be aware of it
did take two weeks to arrive I am in
rural Victoria so that adds a few days
on but I mean yeah two weeks isn't too
bad especially given the kind of
discount that I believe you're getting
on this card one of the reasons why i
have bought this and you know it's good
timing to get it is because if you guys
didn't see last week we covered the AMD
relive edition a crimson relive edition
driver which boosts performance slightly
and some of the existing games but add
some cool new features and yeah it's a
really good driver update from AMD and I
thought well with that big driver update
we've got some exciting product releases
coming in January why not do sort of a a
December holiday season Christmas GPU
comparison update so basically I've got
every every current generation GPU yet
all of them and I'm comparing them all
performance wise with the latest drivers
in the latest games to see how they
stack up and then make some
recommendations for any of you guys
looking at buying a new GPU or graphics
card for Christmas so anyway that's the
power color card I don't think I'll
bother reviewing that card I might do
some an updated for gigabyte vs 8
gigabyte comparison the new games if you
recall Matt did that when the RX 480
first came out using the bios which
could shut off four gigs of that vm so
you could test the card with just four
Gigot accessible or the full eight gig
and back then we found it made no real
difference which was kind of annoying
because it was advertised as being a
two-hundred-dollar us graphics card and
then it's what I came out it well it's
meant to be 240 but it was selling for
well above the MSRP for ages and it sort
of killed the excitement for the RX 480
at least for me anyway I think it did
for quite a few people and I was really
disappointed that AMD didn't send out a
nice full gigabyte model to reviewers
because it was way better value
especially a timer review because like I
said we found no real difference between
eight gig and the four gig version but
you're paying twenty percent more which
kind of kills the cost
frame there but anyway now the four gig
card so we'll see how that stacks up
against stuff like the GTX 1063 gigabyte
and even the RX 470 okay last up we have
a big in this is my presumed case oh
cool the new silverstone k 007 and this
is a new product let's get into it
hopefully you guys can see that ok spear
a sleek black case this is I left some
of the plastic in it right so this case
is currently selling it just got on sale
anyway for a hundred and ten Ozzy so
pretty good price I think we'll see
we'll see what it's like inside actually
probably makes sense to have a bit of a
look outside before we go inside ok so
the power button and reset buttons are
sort of integrated into this striped
horse yes strapped panel on top if you
can see it we have the i/o panel which
has a pair of USB type-c USB 3 port and
then to audio jacks and then looks like
we've got ventilation up the sides and
on top the front and top panels are
plastic the door panels are steel and
underneath we have four feet looks like
it stands the case just over 100 mil off
the ground and a nice removable dust
filter for the power supply then around
the back we have what looks like a 1 40
millimeter fan motherboard IO panel 7
PCI expansion slots and the power supply
goes in the bottom so
let's get this door off a lot of sound
deadening foam in the side panel here
which should feels good quality as well
that should really keep the what well
keep the rattles and words and all the
kind of fad noises and things from
escaping from the case too much it's on
the back side as well means if we got a
nice cut out here in the motherboard
tray for rear access for installing
aftermarket coolers both doors are
secured by thumb screws and there you go
you can see the padding there as well on
the opposite side door so they've done
the typical the whole bottom section of
the case is closed off and that's where
you will put your power supply and
presumably 3.5 inch drives but I will
check that out in a second he / fans for
a hundred and ten dollar case we've got
the one forty millimeter in the rear so
an exhaust fan and there are a pair of
one forty millimeter intake fans up the
front here so that's going to suck a
hell of a lot of it in hopefully keep
everything inside cool a little packet
here with screws and stuff and yet so
down the bottom power supply and a pair
of three and a half inch hard drives or
are these look like they will support
2.5 as well and then you've got your two
and a half so probably SSDs can you go
there standard sort of amount of storage
for a mid-tower they use days and then
there's some nice cable management holes
with rubber grommets to keep everything
looking neat and tidy a pretty simple
inside I mean the main focus with these
Silverstone cases is they like to keep
you know all the things that usually
block air flow like they arm hard drives
power supply all that sort of stuff and
especially well power supply cables down
out of the way and this allows all this
area to basically be unencrypted by
anything other than heat seems like
you'll possibly have a cpu heatsink II
the graphics card and all the air flows
through nicely and they get sucked out
the back so you've got a constant fredo
fresh air cool air flow coming right
through the case over all the critical
components so that's cool and it looks
like you can also add top mounted fans
as well but any
I possibly will end up reviewing this
case so it's a bit of a crazy time at
the moment with so much stuff coming up
and already so much on but if I do have
time this is the case I would like to
review because typically the KL series
from Silverstone has been really good
value really good performing nice
features sorry we'll look at that
probably the next month or two in
greater detail hopefully sooner but yeah
like I said pretty busy so anyway on
today's episode we got to finally kick
up our first full gigabyte our X 480
graphics card so that's cool i can i'll
probably get benchmarking this afternoon
with that that's about all i can be
bothered doing today um after I edit
this video anyway a pair of cherry
keyboards which look quite good quality
I really love the MX board 6 the wrist
rest and that's awesome but the prices
yeah a bit insane very well see if i'll
do a bit more research on that and see
if i can find better pricing for it I
suspect I might be able to anyway so
yeah para keyboards graphics card and a
cool case and the case does seem to be
good value and this I believe was really
good value through newegg so any Ozzy's
wanting an RX for 80 for a really good
price I recommend jumping over to newegg
hitting the drop down at the top to
change from us to Australia and yeah see
if there's this was the best deal when I
bought it two weeks ago I believe it's
still there but i'll check anyway and
i'll i'll throw up an a screenshot of
what the best buy is there at the moment
later this week as well i'll be able to
post that core i3 hyper-threading
performance video I didn't get around
that last week because the AMD real I've
also relive that was I know I've dragged
this video that was a funny painful
little story which i'll quickly tell you
guys about so AMD message merely last
week and said we've got this big driver
update that's under embargo we'd like to
send through the details and if you
could put something together that'd be
cool so I said sure send the details
through and there was a conference call
for a briefing sort of waka sore throat
so there was no
so there was no misunderstandings which
anyway I missed the call and there was a
small misunderstanding nothing too
drastic well yeah I could fix it anyway
but basically I just assumed I didn't
even think at all but I just assumed it
was real I've didn't even enter my mind
that a lie ve was pronounced as live or
live I just assumed alive I yeah when
you're rushing through all this stuff
and I was trying to get all the
benchmarks done so i could do the other
stuff and then record things what
happened you saw the video it was quite
in depth and i went with real real I've
and I thought because they were adding
you know their shadow play tight feature
so to record footage live I don't know
I've just went with real life and I
finished the video and I was getting it
all ready and my wife walked in and
she's like okay that's cool is it real
live or relive I was like what do you
mean when she goes you know live or live
a stared at her blankly and I was like
oh crap just ruined my day so I rang up
AMD and yet it was relived so I'd said
real life about 60 bloody times in that
video so there wasn't really any easy
way to fix it i just spent hours filming
it editing and putting all together and
i had to start from pretty much scratch
so that was frustrating but i got the
video done in time it was up and you
guys have possibly seen it by now so
yeah there are some of the pitfalls of
doing video rather than written which
I've done for more than a decade now
doesn't really matter how you say in
your head it's written the same way and
it's fine but yeah video you've got to
be a bit more aware of those kind of
things so hopefully it won't catch me at
too much in the future ba and video
update of the office how that's going
that's going really well and I'll have a
video for you guys tomorrow with the
office update so that should be
interesting so anyway I'm going to stop
rambling because otherwise this video
will go out to be about half now along
and I have done that before so anyway
I'm your host Steve and I'll catch you
guys later in the week bye
