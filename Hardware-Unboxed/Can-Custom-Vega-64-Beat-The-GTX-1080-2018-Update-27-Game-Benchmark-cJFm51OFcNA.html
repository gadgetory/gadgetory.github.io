finally at long last benchmarking a
custom Vegas 64 graphics card and on
hand for testing I have the Isuzu ROG
Strix model which has now been GP peed
into an Aries card anyway we have the
Strix version on half a Testament please
note it's now called the Aries after a
sue spent two individuals will
performance though should be the same ok
so back when Vegas 64 was first released
we compared it to the geforce gtx 1080
found edition and found it to be 5%
slower on average at 1440p across 32
games since then we've mostly focused on
Vega 56 as we've found that that's a
much better value product and it stands
out quite well to the competing gtx 1070
and I suppose near the 1070 TI anyway
now that it's been almost a year since
Vega 64 was released in its reference
form I felt it was about time we
revisited and why not do that with a
custom Vega 64 graphics card you guys
have only been screaming at me to test
one for the better part of a year now so
maybe we can do that for comparison I
have the MSI GTX 1080 gaming x 8g and
this is the standard 10 gigabits per
second gddr5 X model although both
models are pretty heavily overclocked
out of the box we're still going to
squeeze every last bit of performance
out of them with a custom overclocked
stock the Strix Vegas 64 OC gaming comes
clocked at 1590 megahertz for the core
and 950 megahertz for the HBM to memory
we were able to increase the core clock
to 1700 megahertz and mean 7% overclock
and the memory to 1050 megahertz 11%
overclock
as for the GT x 1080 gaming x 8g it
comes with a base clock of 1683
megahertz and 2502 megahertz
for the gddr5 X memory we were able to
hit eighteen hundred and seventeen
megahertz for the core and this resulted
in a bruise frequency of about 2.1
gigahertz of course that is depending on
load the memory also reached
2.75 gigahertz so an 8% core overclock
and a
10% memory of a clock now as mentioned
earlier we have 27 games in total all of
which have been tested at 1080p using
both these stock and overclock
configurations however I'm only going to
discuss the results for eight of the
games and then jump into our performance
breakdown the rest of the graphs will be
available for free on our patreon page
so check for the link in the video
description as usual our Corsair GPU
test rebuilt inside the crystal series
570 X has been used and inside we have
our core i7 8700 k clocked at five-year
Goats with 32 gigabytes of ddr4 3,200
memory ok so I think that's about
everything let's get to the good stuff
first up we have f1 2017 here we find
very competitive performance between the
two GPUs the GTX 1080 was just four
percent faster on average but three
percent slower for the one percent low
result overclocked the GTX 1080 does
pull clearly into the lead having said
that though we still are only seeing a
single-digit percentage gain next up we
have rec fest and the first time I
tested with this game I use it to
compare the RX 580 and GTX 1060 and this
saw in video trailing by a 10% margin
for that particular comparison however
after multiple driver updates the
GeForce performance in this title does a
Peter we've improved somewhat now the
GTX 1080 is able to pull ahead of Vegas
64 at least when looking at the average
frame rate here we have a title that's
pretty much always favored AMD and that
is Tom Clancy's Rainbow six siege and we
see that today that still remains true
the GTX 1080 was eight percent slower
out of the box and four percent slower
once overclocked moving on to Far Cry 5
and here we see the Isuzu Vegas 64 card
was a smidgen quicker than the MSI GTX
1080 then once overclocked we see
basically the same performance although
an AMD sponsored title far cry 5 is very
well optimized so I do view this as a
fair fight then next up we have
fortnight using the Unreal Engine which
is pretty much optimized for NVIDIA and
Intel hardware and this gives the GTX
1080 a rather significant 19 percent
performance advantage overclocking
further extends this margin out at 23
percent of course in favor of the NVIDIA
GPU Total War saga Thrones of Britannia
is the newest game added
here and we find very competitive
results with Vegas 64 just edging ahead
for the frame time performance overall
though a very similar experience using
either GPU ARMA 3 has now been optimized
to the point where it plays very similar
on AMD and NVIDIA hardware which is
quite shocking because about a year ago
the radio performance was a disaster so
it's great to see such competitive
results here like fortnight player owned
owns battlegrounds is also built upon
the Unreal Engine and as a result favors
Hardware from the Green Team here we see
the GTX 1080 enjoying a 14% performance
advantage out of the box making it the
preferred GPU for this title as for
power consumption well as you might have
expected at this point Vega does guzzle
quite a bit more power pushing total
system consumption 18% higher when
comparing the out of the box figures
overclocked that margin is extended to
23% and that is the most voltage
optimized overclock we could achieve
with Vega 64 okay so from that small 8
game sample we saw quite a bit of back
and forth between these two though
that's probably be expected and now
though let's get the full picture by
looking at the results across all 27
games tested first up we have these
stock out-of-the-box results comparing
the MSI GTX 1080 gaming xhg to the asou
Strix Vega 64 OC gaming here we see that
the GeForce graphics card was just 5%
faster on average the outliers include
frost Punk where the GTX 1080 was 33%
faster and then dirt 4 where it was 27%
slower that said Vega 64 also struggled
quite poorly in GTA 5 Warhammer 2
fortnight project cars to Sniper Elite 4
when using DirectX 11 and Assassin's
Creed origins overclocking each graphics
card extended the GTX sally's lead out
to 8% there overall we did see very
similar performance trends across the
board
overall the GeForce graphics card was
faster by a margin gray than 5% in 16 of
the titles tested and slower by a 5
percent or greater margin in just two of
them so a pretty clear advantage going
away of the green team here as I noted
at the start of this video almost a year
ago now in Vega 64 was first released we
compared it the GeForce GTX 1080
founders ition and found it to be 5%
slower
on average at 1440p across 32 games but
whatever reason that testing really
seemed to stir things up extremists in
either camp appeared quite upset with
our findings though I do typically deem
our content a success if I've managed to
upset fanboys on both sides
Nvidia fans are upset because I used an
Fe model despite the fact that I wanted
to make a reference to reference
comparison since Vega 64 cards or custom
Vega 64 cards I weren't yet available
then AMD fans are upset because hell I
can't even remember why they're upset
now probably a whole heap of things that
weren't really warranted or made any
sense that's typically how those things
seemed to go our point is there was a
big hoo-ha about the results being
misleading and for whatever reason one
team was going to come out well on top
at some point in time for some reason I
actually said at the time that I
expected custom cards just like this one
to actually be quite a bit faster avoid
throttling handle higher frequencies and
just in general deliver better
performance turns out I was pretty much
wrong about that one almost a year later
pretty much the same story different set
of games but still a lot of games and
what we found was that 5% difference
going in favor of the GTX 1080 at 1440p
these findings aren't unusual either at
this point should be pretty common
knowledge that overall the GTX 1080 is
going to come out ahead more often than
not I could have very easily handpicked
six to nine titles to test with that
would heavily favor one company more
than the other but with well over a 20
game sample you get a pretty clear
picture of where things stand when it
came time to overclock it was pretty
straightforward with the GTX 980
Vegas 64 though was a different kettle
of fish and I tried pretty much
everything to unlock that next level
performance that under vaulting is said
to achieve but no matter what I tried
the end result was well it was pretty
underwhelming every time I also failed
to find any credible sources that have
shown significant performance gains from
overclocking the Zeus rx and Vegas 64
graphics card so at the other day it
seems quite clear that AMD's come out
well short at the
and sure at this point that doesn't
surprise a lot of you but we still see
arguments in the comments saying that
Vegas 64 is now better than the GTX time
clearly not true today the cheapest of
Vegas 64 graphics card costs around 580
dollars u.s. that's around $100 u.s.
more than the cheapest GT X 1080 models
therefore we don't see sense in paying
around 20% more for about 5% less
performance on average that said right
now I suggest you buy neither of these
products as we're knocking pretty much
on the door of the next generation
release from Nvidia so really an
absolutely terrible time to buy a new
graphics card I highly recommend you do
not do that
also as a side note this video did
include a lot of decks 11 and X 12
testing and all the tiles that supported
both api's and I will be creating a
separate video very shortly that focuses
on comparing those results so that
should be quite interesting and that is
going to do it for this one if you did
