kicking things off last week I checked
it off aim these mighty Fury acts was
still worth buying and as is always the
case with graphics cards it's really the
price that makes or breaks them and
we've seen this time and time again in
the past what could be a bad buy one
week could quickly become the new
must-have item after a price drop in the
case of The Fury acts it went on sale
for $650 u.s. back in mid 2015 and at
the time it's struggling in certain
videos then flagship gtx 980ti which was
released early in the same month and yes
yes I know the tight necks was the real
flagship GPU of the time but at over
fifty percent more expensive for less
than 10 percent more performance it
wasn't exactly relevant anyway getting
back on track the Furious really came up
against it as in video was hitting full
stride with their Maxwell architecture
still the fury ax was a marvel of
engineering and will always be one of
history's most exciting and interesting
graphics cards even if the sales didn't
reflect that recently major online
retailers such as Amazon I've been
letting remaining fury acts go quite
cheap some as low as $300 u.s. so I
wanted to see if it was indeed worth
buying one of these GPUs at that price
there are also of course the possibility
of second-hand deals so knowing where
the fury exits in today's landscape
would be useful for potential buyers
coming away from that initial video a
few of you were disappointed I didn't
test the gtx 980ti as well well never
fear
you haven't had to wait long for this
video I'm including the GTX 980 and
comparing it with the fury X as well as
the relevant current generation GPUs the
gtx 980ti isn't on sale anymore given it
was effectively replaced by the gtx 1070
back in June of 2016
sellers such as newegg.com do have
refurbished stock but they are priced
above the gtx 1070 s so obviously not
worth buying then that said second our
deals can be found for around $300 u.s.
and at that price the 980 I might start
to become a worthwhile investment on
hand for testing I have the reference
model of the gtx 980ti and that's okay
because we had the reference fury expert
can
and technically there are no
custom-designed fury X cards they're all
based on a Indies reference design and
to my knowledge there's no factory
overclocked models available
so anyway previously I didn't bother
overclocked in a fury X because I know
it to be a pretty terrible overclocker
if I'm honest however because I will be
overclocking the 980ti of this
comparison I've gone back and
overclocked to the fury X as best I can
by default the nan a 2i runs at a base
cloth of 1 gigahertz with a maximum
boost clock of 1.2 gigahertz and a
memory speed of 1.75 gigahertz
overclocked I was able to push the call
to a base clock speed of 1.2 gigahertz
which resulted in a boost clock speed of
one point four eight you get hurt the
memory also reached two gigahertz for a
transfer rate of 80 bits per second so
that's a 25% overclock for the core and
a 14% boost for the memory the fury X
which I tried a few different tricks
with only went as high as eleven hundred
and fifty megahertz for the core and 525
megahertz for the memory so that's a 10%
core of a clock and a 5% memory
overclock okay so one final note
previously I tested the fury X using 19
modern games but for this comparison
I've reduced that number to just six
games having now seen how the gtx 1070
and fury x comparing a broad range of
new games i didn't feel there was a need
to go over all the data again with the
980ti
instead I've removed games that provided
outlier type results for example
dishonored to quantum break watchdogs to
f1 2016 overwatch and rise of the Tomb
Raider world dropped as a heavily
favored the gtx 1070 however i also
remove doom total bull hammer hit man
and Deus Ex mankind divided because they
all save it or at least helped the fury
ax close the gap on the gtx 1070 games
that provided competitive results
included battlefield 1 Call of Duty
infinite warfare Gears of War 4 Far Cry
primal Mirror's Edge catalyst and the
division so these are the games I'll be
focusing on for this quick comparison as
I'll give us a really good idea of how
the gtx 980ti and furious compare in
modern titles anyway enough chitchat
let's get to the results first that we
have Far Cry primal and here we
previously found that the fury axe was
good for an average of 58 FPS at 1440p
using the ultra quality settings
overclocked if your ex pushed the
average framerate to 60
psi means three percent performance bump
out of the box the reference 9a2 I match
the overclocked fury axe with a 60 FPS
average and a 51 FPS minimum so that's
quite competitive it also meant that the
gtx 980ti was just 8% slower than the
gtx 1070 founders edition graphics card
however the 980ti does have quite a bit
left in the tank and this can be
exploited through overclocking our
overclock boosted the average frame rate
by 17% allowing for 70 FPS with a 58 FPS
minimum this made the reference 92 a
faster than even the factory overclocked
2 gigabyte gtx 1070 g1 gaming graphics
card by a 6% margin the fury X wasn't a
great deal slower than the gtx 1070
founder's edition graphics card in Call
of Duty infinite warfare that's at
overclocking only boosted performance by
3% to come within a frame of the
founders edition graphics card still
when compared to the geforce gtx 800 in
this tale the fury x is 6 percent faster
at the stock operating clock speeds of
course very few gtx 980ti graphics cards
met the Nvidia specifications and most
were quite heavily factory overclocked
while perhaps not as fast as our custom
overclock we found that it is possible
to squeeze another 17 percent out of the
gtx 980ti
taking the average frame rate 283 FPS
that made it 8 percent faster than our
overclocked t-rex configuration and 4
percent faster than gigabytes gtx 1070
g1 gaming model the Gears of War 4
results are quite shocking in fact I was
so surprised I ran this stock and
overclocked gtx 980ti configuration
multiple times at the stock clock speeds
the GTX 980 I match the fury acts with
similar performance making them both
slightly slower than the gtx 1070 g1
gaming
however once overclocked the gtx 980ti
somehow finds 26 percent more
performance in this title boosting the
average frame rate 291 FPS that huge
performance gain meant that the GTX 980
was not only much faster than the fury X
and factory overclocked gtx 1070 but it
wasn't a great deal slow in the GTX 1080
Mirror's Edge catalyst provides more
typical results though even hear the
overclocked gtx 980ti looks very
impressive at the stock clock speeds the
980 I was actually three percent slower
than the fury X however once we have a
clock both graphics cards and on ATI
finds itself with a rather commanding
11% lead and is again able to edge out
the
gigabyte gtx 1070 g1 gaming the division
was tested using the direct x12 api and
here the GTX 980 I really struggled with
an average of just 50 Y fps making it
just 5 FPS faster than the rx 480 and
15% slower than the fury X however the
980 is again rescued by is overclocking
prowess here we see a 24% boost in
performance as the frame rate it's 63
FPS to match the overclocked fury X the
GTX 980 I only gained an extra 15
percent performance from overclocking
when testing with battlefield 1 but
again that is enough to not only pull
ahead of the fury X but also beat
graphics cards such as gigabytes gtx
1070 g1 gaming the power consumption
results are really interesting the gtx
980ti only consumes 16% more power once
overclocked which is quite impressive
since we regularly saw performance gains
of at least 20% moreover with a total
system consumption of 341 watts the
overclocked 980 TI only consumed the
same level of power as the standard fury
X speaking of the fury x given how small
those performance gains we're it doesn't
make sense to overclock this graphics
card especially when the total system
consumption is increased by 18 percent
in videos geforce gtx 980ti still
clearly a very capable graphics card and
this is why many who bought it back in
2015 so lovin bothered upgrading or
something like the gtx 1070 or even the
gtx 1080 comparing a stock standard 980
as a little misleading as very few would
have purchased a reference or stock
clocked card and those that did likely
ended up overclocking it anyway as
there's so much more extra performance
to be had our overclock which was
extremely easy to achieve boosted the
performance on average by 20% and I
don't need to tell you that's pretty
huge so while the GTX 980 I might have
been four percent slower on average than
the fury X once both graphics cards were
overclocked it was 11% faster although I
did only test with half a dozen games
for this quick comparison the games
tested did show competitive results
between the gtx 1070 and fury x in my
last video so this should have made for
a fair comparison between the 980 TI and
fury ax when compared to the gtx 1070 to
overclocked 980 our configuration was on
average 7% faster than the gigabyte g1
gaming model so again this is why 980ti
o
waiting for something faster likely
1080i or possibly even Vega before they
upgrade right now the cheapest gtx 1070
graphics cards are selling for around
three hundred and seventy five dollars
u.s. though i should mention that last
week gigabyte were letting their mini
ITX OSI model go for as little as three
hundred and sixty u.s. anyway given
those prices i made the recommendation
that those shopping for a few x probably
should look at spending around three
hundred dollars and essentially buying a
980 i second hand i really don't
recommend spending much over three
hundred dollars again especially since
for this purchase you probably won't be
getting any warranty anyway i'm keen to
hear from you guys has anyone picked up
a checking 980ti deal or plan to in the
very near future let me on the comment
section below I'm your host Steve and
I'll catch you on the next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
