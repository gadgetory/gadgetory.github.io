video we are exploring
just'cause force graphics options on PC
to provide you guys with an optimal set
of settings that provides the perfect
balance between visuals and performance
as Steve showed in his big GPU benchmark
of the game this title really runs like
crap
especially on mid tier and all the
hardware so hopefully there's a few
things we can tweak to get the game
running better with that much lost to
visual quality I think it's fair to say
the game isn't the most visually
attractive one released this year and it
certainly doesn't provide visuals that
match the performance you get while the
lighting system and destructibility is
impressive in some areas the game is
quite lacking as far as models
characters textures and a few other
effects are concerned it is a massive
open world game with varied environments
but I feel perhaps too much time was
spent making the world huge rather than
focusing on these areas along with you
know general engine optimization on top
of that there are a few frustrations
with the PC version such as a terrible
menu system especially for the graphics
options which requires you to scroll
down the list to hit apply and then back
every time you enter the graphics menu
yet you can't use your Mouse's scroll
wheel or escape or backspace for this so
yeah not great there and driving cars
using keyboard controls also feels
rather awful I think that needs a bit of
tweaking I reckon but perhaps the
biggest omission our graphics presets
just calls for has 13 different graphics
options but there are no presets to
nicely tie everything together for
people that you just want to play the
game with minimal fuss a lot of the
settings there a simple yes/no toggle
but still a small selection of presets
is pretty standard in PC games that said
at least it runs about 60 FPS and had
arbitrary resolutions and you can change
graphics settings without restarting the
game which is always nice before I get
into the comparisons there's some
standard housekeeping to go over
everything was tested using a variety of
high end and mid-range graphics cards
from AMD and NVIDIA so the numbers you
see here should be representative of
performance across most systems however
we were using our core i7 8700 K test
rig with 16 gigabytes of ddr4 memory
so for the entirety of our testing we
work GPU bound all the captures you see
in this video were taken using an NVIDIA
GeForce r-tx 20 80 TI at 4k and we
recommend watching this video at 4k for
maximum quality it's a bit easy to spot
the differences in each setting at
youtube's highest quality mode or you
can download a source quality file from
our patreon page anyway let's get into
it first up is anisotropic level which
refers to of course anisotropic
filtering this is one of the most
straightforward settings in most games
and governs how clear textures are at
weird angles and if you're playing the
game with the maximum texture quality
setting we always recommend leaving
anisotropic filtering on the maximum 16x
setting as well you can see in this shot
that as the road curves up through the
heels having a higher AF level shows
clearer road textures further into the
distance the choice of which scene to
use even easier when comparing the
performance difference between 16x and
1x despite a large difference to visual
quality you'll gain almost nothing in
terms of frame rate from choosing a
lowest setting for this reason 16x is an
easy choice anti-aliasing is next up and
we have three choices here
temporal SMA a FXAA without any temporal
components and no anti-aliasing so
there's only two very basic
post-processing anti-aliasing methods
available here and to be honest neither
really any good their temporal SMA a
mode in particular is absolute garbage
it's barely any better at removing
shimmering and jagged edges than FXAA
yet introduces horrible ghosting effects
in motion due to the temporal component
this is a fast-paced game so I wouldn't
even consider using temporal smh due to
the artifacting FXAA is also a bad
choice because it too doesn't do a great
job of removing jagged edges while no
AAA is of course also bad so really
there's no good anti-aliasing option in
this tile which is very disappointing in
terms of performance temporal SMA a
causes a surprisingly high performance
here turning it down to FX a will lead
to 5% higher frame rates and I reckon
FXAA looks slightly better as well due
to the lack of those ghosting effects
there's not much more performance to be
gained from disabling anti-aliasing
entirely it's a real toss-up between FX
a and no AAA here depending on how you
like your games to
texture quality is a simple affair you
want to keep it on the highest possible
setting unless you run out of graphics
memory for example on a super low-end
GPU very high textures give noticeably
sharper shadows than the other three
settings while understandably low is the
worst considering there is basically no
performance difference between all four
modes again the choice to use very high
is simple for most people water quality
is an interesting setting because the
water effects in Just Cause four aren't
amazing on the high settings in fact so
the most part that look pretty terrible
and one area that's received you know a
bit of a downgrade compared to just call
us three there is very little difference
between the very high high and medium
modes while low flattens out the water
considerably and looks pretty bad the
main difference I spotted between the
top three modes is the wake you leave
while swimming medium disables this
effect while it's still present on the
highest settings not that this effect
looks good when enabled though when you
look at the performance difference
there's really not much point adjusting
the setting you'll only start to gain a
significant amount moving to low which
looks pretty bad and I'd only recommend
that setting for those with low end GPUs
for everyone else I think very high is
the way to go here ocean tessellation
surprise surprise only affects how the
water surface looks in the oceans
specifically I didn't spot any changes
to the water in the games rivers which
have fewer waves the visual difference
is basically non-existent between the
two settings but curiously disabling
ocean tessellation actually leads to a
performance reduction my suspicion here
is just corn spore uses a slightly
different ocean simulation depending on
whether you have tessellation on or off
with tessellation providing better
performance one factor is another simple
setting it governs how many minor
objects are in view and at what distance
therapy it doesn't seem to affect the
foliage system in any significant way
rather the main changes in the village
and city areas with items on buildings
and so forth disappearing on lower
settings there really isn't much
difference between the four modes here
and when you look at the performance
difference this makes sense it's only
when you move down to medium or low that
you are getting around a two to three
percent performance improvement honestly
I think a lot of people could play on
medium rather than very high without
being able to spot me changes but the
framerate improvement probably isn't
worth slightly more noticeable pop in as
you flying around just cause fours
shadow system has four main tight
of shadows we have very nice shadows
which are the shadows closest to you
including your personal shadow
there's moderate shadows for things
reasonably close to the camera but more
than a few meters away
there's far shadows when you have you
know your expansive view with large draw
distances and there's also cloud shadows
cloud shadows are a bit strange in that
they are updated at 1 to 2 FPS compared
to the real-time updating for other
shadows such as foliage and that makes
those cloud shadows look a bit weird if
you look closely each of the 4 shadow
mode simply governs the quality of the 4
shadow types with very high having the
sharpest most realistic shadows and then
each successive setting noticeably
coming down on shadow sharpness and
overall quality however there is no
change to shadow draw distance so
there's nowhere to increase the point at
which very near and moderate shadows are
swapped out the draw distance for the
highest quality shadows is very short so
this kind of point is super noticeable
as you move through the world and in
general there's quite a bit of pop into
the shadow system in terms of
performance there's no significant
difference between the four modes
despite the noticeable quality to change
at best you're looking at a 2 percent
improvement to average frame rates
opting for low instead of very high and
that's simply not worth it when looking
at the visual change I'd keep the
setting on very high unless you have a
low-end rig ssao or screen space ambient
occlusion is the most performance taxing
setting in the game and also has a
pretty significant impact on how the
game looks especially in the dense
forest and jungle areas of the map SSAO
adds a significant amount of shadowing
and depth to the game world generally
speaking if you have the GPU horsepower
to run the setting you want to keep it
enabled however the performance
improvement from turning SSAO off isn't
massive we're talking about a 15 percent
improvement to average frame rates which
is by far the highest performance uplift
of any setting normally I'd complain
about such a huge performance hit from a
single setting but realistically this
game uses a lot of SSAO so it does seem
somewhat warranted that said if you're
on a performance constraint PC this is
the first setting aren't disabled you
will lose the key effect of visual
quality but you also gain so much
performance motion blur is one of those
settings a lot of people choose to
disable anyway but in the case of Just
Cause 4 you should definitely disable it
because the motion blur implementation
is pretty rubbish it seems to use some
sort
of low quality sampling that just
straight-up looks bad turn it off and
save your eyes the trouble you also pick
up about 2% to average performance in
the process and nearly 5% to 1% loads
which is decent for an effect you won't
want to use anyway edge fade is a
cosmetic setting that basically turns on
or off a vignette around the screen it
has no impact on performance and it's a
personal preference as to whether you
want it on or off personally I'll leave
it off global illumination is similar to
SSAO in that it does have a noticeable
impact on how the lighting system works
in just cause for when you enable the
setting the world's lighting becomes
more realistic and more accurate again
particularly in dense forest areas and
in the cities this is because the
setting governs where the light can
bounce off surfaces onto other surfaces
or not disabling global illumination
improves performance by 4% and it's
probably one of the first effects I've
disabled if I needed more performance
along with SSAO
I think it's a more subtle effect than
SSAO so it's a prime candidate to switch
off on mid-range Hardware screen space
reflections are a common effect used in
games and in Just Cause for its most
noticeable along the many water surfaces
around the map with SSR on there are
reflections on the water and with SSR
off there are not so pretty simple one
here and honestly I think the water
looks pretty bad and flat without SSR on
at least worse than it does to begin
with I disable the SSR leads to about a
4% improvement to performance however
unlike global illumination I think this
setting has a big influence on how the
game world looks I try and keep it
enabled unless you are searching for a
lot more performance final setting in
the game is bokeh depth of field and
this is one that has a rather subtle
effect on the presentation but is
visible at all times
basically distant objects will be very
very slightly blurred and there's no
blur with the setting off in most scenes
is really hard to spot the difference
while the setting comes with a two
percent performance so I'd recommend
disabling it for extra performance and
that's all the settings in just calls
for there are basically only a handful
that have a significant effect on visual
quality and performance most settings
either do nothing to improve performance
and a significant cost of visuals or
provide such minor improvements you may
as well disable them the big ones are
SSAO and global illumination whatever
combination of those settings you choose
will likely influence how the game looks
and run
for you those with high-end systems
should have both enabled if you're after
a bit of extra performance I'd recommend
disabling global illumination and then
mid-range or entry level gamers should
have both disables on a mid-range card
you're looking at up to a 25%
performance improvement in the most
intensive areas of the map simply from
disabling those two settings most other
settings are leaf on the maximum
available with a few exceptions I
recommend turning off both motion blur
and bokeh depth of field and I'll set
the anti-aliasing mode to FXAA because
it looks better and performs better than
temporal SMA if you are really hunting
for the last few drops of performance
the only other things that make a
significant difference are screen space
reflections and all of water quality
shadow quarry and LOD factor but only
when set to their lowest setting so here
are our three main Hardware unboxed
recommended settings profiles side by
side along with every setting at its
maximum we have both SSAO and global
illumination enabled just ssao enabled
and neither enabled we also have motion
blur and depth of field off fxaa is used
and every other setting is that maximum
our baseline recommendation improves
performance by 13 percent then disabling
global illumination brings that up to 18
percent and then disabling SSAO as well
we'll deliver you a 40 percent
performance improvement this is a
best-case scenario figures in the jungle
area of the map where performance tends
to be the worst I still think there's a
fair bit of work that could be done to
improve popping for objects and shadows
plus there are plenty of real glitches I
experienced throughout the game so I
guess it's now up to avalanche to get
their act together and improve this
engine considering the state the game
launched in technically and visually
you'd have to think this engine is
pretty much on its last legs and will
need a significant overhaul for any
future games I'm not gonna harp on any
more about its visuals or performance I
think Steve did a great job of tearing
this game a new one in his video and I
agree it looks pretty mediocre and runs
about as well as an ostrich with no legs
and unfortunately a lot of the tweaks we
recommend to get the game running better
do make the game look even worse anyway
that's it for this video let us know
what you think of just calls for in the
comments below not sure if I should
commit to playing this one yet myself
considering the mixed reviews online
yes consider subscribing for more game
optimization videos in 2019 and we also
