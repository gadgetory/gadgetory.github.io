another episode of unboxing boxes as you
can see we've got five boxes here
there's two rather large boxes and the
large boxes usually deliver some pretty
good stuff so fingers crossed actually
I'm really hoping my rx 580 is in one of
these boxes I've got a couple of our x5
ATS on the way or I've been promised a
couple of them and I'm quite late to the
party on that one but it's kind of a
good thing because usually with the day
1 coverage it's really really rushed out
a couple of days to get the content
together and I'm sort of starting a shy
away from it to be honest with you guys
I hope that doesn't make the channel any
less relevant but I just really getting
over the rushed content that isn't quite
as good as what we could do if we had a
week or so so with the RX 580 stuff I'm
going to take probably about a week from
now to get that online for you guys to
watch I want to test the RX 580 and a
massive probably be something like a 20
minute long video compared to the new
gtx 1060 the refresh model with the 9 do
you give it to a second memory and at
least well over 20 games at least 25
games i'll compare up to resolutions and
look at a heap of other stuff as well so
very very in-depth review there that
should be well worth waiting for and
well worth watching that's the hope
anyway also I mentioned in a previous
video I have set up the patron account
now for harbor on box to try and help
with the revenue stream now that YouTube
sort of fallen apart there with the
Adsense and what I've done with that is
to give you guys something that's a bit
exclusive a bit unique for one dollar a
month apart from the livestream content
that I am doing with Brian over at X
city so that's pretty cool as well but I
thought for this rx 580 comparison you
guys usually have an opinion on what
games you'd like to see included or
excluded from the comparison so a few
days ago I listed I made a post with all
the games the 20 plus games that will
that I proposed it should be included
and you guys can see which games you
want to add or remove or if there's any
other sort of requirements you'd like
feel free to make a post about it on the
patreon page so I'll put a link to that
in the description and if you do want to
pay a dollar to be part of that per
month then feel free to if not then
that's fine you don't have to you can
just keep watching the high quality
content that comes on the channel
alright
anyway enough of me waffling on I will
get into the boxes because you guys are
wanting to see what goodies we have this
time all right
who's this from palace so we're pretty
well guaranteed a graphics card here
that's not going to be an rx 580 because
they're an Nvidia partner so I'm not
sure what they've got for us
I didn't they didn't start inform me of
anything being sent
so total surprise ear - do we have some
bubble wrap okay this could be good if
this could be good indeed and you see
what's in there I did not know I was
getting one of these with a super jet
stream GTX 1080 Ti
that's going to put a smile on your face
every time it's a good day when you get
a gtx 980ti alright it looks like a
pallet graphics card so far oh gee the
big sucker okay that is a seriously
beefy graphics card there are that 1080
models were big don't know if this is
any bigger but it's it's mighty big
either way check out the thickness of
that thing I really like the neutral
color scheme they've gone for as you'd
expect it has RGB lighting this is at
least RGB here I think there's some
lighting behind the fans 100% you'll
have to plug it in to find out I will be
reviewing this of course probably
probably next week if not the week after
them be no later than the week after I
promise yeah that is an impressive
looking graphics card it's got a pair of
8-pin connectors but other than that I
don't really know too much about the
carpet I don't know what the power phase
designs like it looks quite impressive
from here what seems looks like there's
at least 10 phase 10 phases but
we'll find out for the official review
anyway I didn't like I said I wasn't
expecting this card at the total
surprise
very very nice surprise I have to say
anyway I'll stop admiring the card and
I'll uh move on to the next thing but
we'll look at that again in detail
shortly let's go through since we've had
a very exciting unboxing they'll go
through this little package from
Logitech could be a mouse hard to say
we'll find out it's not going to be a
gtx 980ti i can assure you that okay we
have a little box inside ah the Yui
wonder boom Yui is a Logitech brand and
they make some very very cool Bluetooth
speakers we've seen quite a few of their
speakers on the channel over the years
they've all been very good and they're
actually all still in use I've given
most of them to various family members
and they're really enjoying them well
it's like a hand grenade dispar doing
very cool speaker I know why they call
it their pint-sized speaker now yeah the
usual it'll come in a heap of range of
different colors but I love the material
I use on this because that's very cool
with the rubber and stuff as well and
this is ipx7 I think ipx7 Raiders that
means it's up to one meter it can be
submerged up to a meet up to something
like thirty minutes without failing so
that's very cool and it also floats off
you have it on a boat or something and
you drop it over the side it isn't going
to sink to the bottom of the ocean you
can just scoop it up off the surface so
that's kind of cool
on the back here USB port presumably for
charging it up obviously you've got your
power volume up and down pairing button
probably the power on button as well but
there's another button here as well so
maybe that's the pairing button maybe
that's just a power button we'll find
out in a minute
we asked a very very cool little speaker
they claimed up to ten hours of run time
per charge that's very cool and another
really impressive feature is a
hundred-foot wireless Bluetooth range so
you can take your phone or whatever
device you're streaming music from quite
far from the speaker without it cutting
out
that's cool okay what's got some battery
charge found the speakers straightaway
my note for actually hoping to replace
my note four very soon I've got a Galaxy
s8 plus on the Laois hoping it would get
here today but it hasn't alright so
anyway it's connected let's try some
music
well that's really cool I like how the
the audio is really 360-degree it comes
out from all angles a matter where you
position yourself around the speaker it
sounds exactly the same which is quite
impressive I don't know how the speaks
are again tatted within the thinner unit
but amazing 360 degree yeah that vert
eise's 360 degree audio and it very much
is actually I'll check how much this
thing sell so it was very impressive
okay so for the quality of this speaker
I think the price is very reasonable to
100 US or 160 Aussie which seems a bit
pricey for a smallish Bluetooth speaker
but the audio is very loud
I love the 360 degree sort of audio
sound ah and it's got a 10-hour battery
which it's advertised to have that
variable and good range so I've looked
at the UE roll the boom a few other ones
and they've all been fantastic like I
said they've been heavily used by
various family members and they love
them so very cool speaker don't know
I'll probably won't do a dedicated
review on this but I'll report back in a
few months and let you guys know how
it's going probably do a few submersion
tests and things like that yeah very
cool I love it alright next on the menu
let's check out this the biggest box
we've got here
hmm okay so we've got a heap of
anti-static bags wow that's a lot of
anti-static bags okay okay so we got
some as rock stuff as rock have just
kind of this box yet with anything they
could get their hands on so we have some
some old brochures for their extreme 172
100 series boards so they're no longer
relevant but this is very very relevant
uh-huh so cool
all right because rock a be 350 gaming K
for you guys have been begging me for be
350 reviews and what I think I might do
I've got that a Seuss prime board I've
got the gigabyte gaming 3 board I've now
got this if I get my hands on an MSI
board in the next week I reckon it's
probably time to do a four-way be fit be
350 rather board around up that could be
very cool
and that'll answer the questions that
you guys have been asking me non-stop to
be 350 content something that's in the
works I might even do a dedicated review
for this board as well um but yeah
whatever
let's have a quick look at it shall we
who are nearly knocked that Titan sorry
that that GTX 1080i card off the desk
alright wow that's a really nice-looking
board actually I'll get some b-roll of
it so you guys can see some close-up
shots of it yeah very cool looking board
it's very it's much more I think how
would you say tasteful than the assuit
and gigabyte boards well they look quite
fine they're also black and red themed
there's sort of a bit crazy with the PCB
there's a lines and things going every
which will probably appeal for some but
this is a bit more neutral a bit more
bit more tasteful in my opinion just a
few red highlights here in there which
really set it off and it's interesting
to note that it does have a pair of em
two slots which is very rare for a be
350 board and a guess I would say the
secondary slot here if you use that
probably this secondary PCI Express slot
looks like it's wide so for
damnit that would get eliminated
disabled so yeah I would say if you use
both of the m2 slots
only the primary PCIe x 16 slot will be
active and that's got like MSI's steel
armor stuff but obviously it's not msi
shocks they are all sort of doing that
now and I suppose if you're going to
chuck something like this in there um
you'd want that extra support because
that will Bend that slot quite easily
obviously to be supported by the case
here but still you can see how massive
that graphics card is and it has to
weigh it's easily over a kilo and way
anyway oh um check that out it's really
high quality looking be 350 board here
it looks like we've got those 633 looks
like it's a nine phase power delivery
system on this one and we have the real
tech eight nine - so must be a the ALC
eight nine to codec so that's probably
got the cinema three creative cinema
three support as well so that'll be a
really good audio solution I can see
that it's on an isolated section of the
PCB so it's probably got all the usual
sort of sound purity stuff that asrock
offer I like how these solder slots SATA
ports rather although there's only four
of them they are intended really nice
and neat not like at all individual so
that will make cable management really
good of course you have its extra two
here which will be connected to a
third-party controller of some
description it's probably under this
heat sink here you'll have to wait for
the review before you get those details
and plenty of connectivity around at the
i/o panel you've got a pair of legacy
USB twos a couple of USB 3s USB 3.1 type
C anything missing from he will probably
be a display port but I imagine pretty
much all you guys will be using a
discreet graphics card anyway yeah very
very nice looking board actually I'm not
going to wait for the review to tell you
guys I'm quite keen to see how much this
boards work ok well that's pretty
impressive the board is only swap
selling right now on Newegg for 105 US
and it's available in quite a few
different outlets in Australia for one
hundred and fifty five dollars Ozzie
that's a
really good price for what looks to be
quite a high-end be 350 motherboard
actually I was so excited by that be 350
board I forgot there's another board in
the box which is interesting because
this is a very very good board I not to
be a very good board because I got it
about six weeks ago the X 370 gaming k4
actually I'm not sure I do have this
board the X 370 gaming I think the
gaming k4 is the well I feel is we've
got five gigabit ethernet so that's
pretty awesome
and I'll be back in one moment alright
I'm back now I can't even keep track of
all the boards I have so X 370 gaming k4
that's the board I opened and shown on
the channel before Rison was even
released and I was going to commit this
board to a build very soon so anyway
let's just see what we have here okay
well I definitely don't have this board
and my other board definitely doesn't
come with a pre-installed rise in the
CPU so that's a nice little bonus 1600 X
chip well I thank you very much as Rach
well I didn't think anything was going
to top that be 350 board but this you
certainly have what an awesome looking
board wow this is probably the most
extreme I am for motherboard I've seen
yet
it looks like there's a 16 sized vrm on
this board so well and yeah obviously
the usual retail boards won't come with
a 1600 X on there but that's pretty cool
well it looks like this board really
does have all the bells and whistles
which is nice to see for an am 4 board
it's good to see we've got all the sort
of same features you'd expect to find on
like I said 270 board for example so
we've got the dual PCIe x 16 slots so
the second one is only wide for 8 x
which makes sense we've got the Sound
Blaster cinema 3 audio which has again
all the bells and whistles that you'll
find on the Intel equivalents
pair of ultra and while one ultra em to
another m2 slot what do we got here
we've got 10 SATA ports oh that's plenty
there we've got a pair of two USB 3.0
headers fair bit of connectivity here
nice to see that five Gigabit Ethernet
port there I really hope very soon
hopefully this year we get some good
networking gear for that sort of stuff
so some five gigabit switches at a
reasonable price not holding my breath
but that would be cool
so yeah an almost spare time I'll
probably have to put together a review
of this board also so we're gonna fit
that in but yeah thank you very much as
rock keen to check it out well this has
been an eventful unboxing series so far
we've seen already a lot of very cool
products when I go for the yellow one or
the brown one let's get this yellow one
out of the way here we go
Oh hahaha yes finally an RX 580 graphics
card my work can now begin so this is
the sapphire Nitro+ Edition again I know
nothing about this product have no idea
this actual particular model was coming
but let's let's have a bit of a look at
it okay so it looks a lot like the other
nitro cards I've seen in the past whoa
okay it's got a fairly in-your-face
backplate though and it is very very
heavy for a card of sort of this size
there are they look thicker than eight
millimeter those heat pipes but there
are at least eight millimeter anyway it
was two really big heat pipes it looks
like a pair of six millimeter heat pipes
in the bottom check out that backplate
though so it's a silver gray and black
design what events and things cut out of
it looks extremely aggressive
yes that's really nice plenty of
connectivity around the backside so it
looks like we've got a pair of HDMI is
pair of display ports and a dual link
DVI output as well obviously a pair of
100 millimeter fans which will do a good
job of key
that heatsink cool and it really is a
massive heatsink on this card it's
really impressive I can't believe how
heavy it is for such a small card it's
actually not that much lighter than this
thing and you see this they're actually
they're not that different in terms of
size this one's clearly bigger but it's
not that much bigger it's not that much
heavier for a 1080i so I expect this
card to run a really nice and cool looks
like this sapphire logo here or branding
will light up probably RGB possibly the
same for the fans not sure but I'm very
keen to plug that in and have a go do
they talk about clock speeds anywhere
not on the box I'll have to do a bit of
research on that and not not short the
clock speeds up but it's obviously an
overclocked model so you can expect that
sapphire has squeezed a little bit more
out of the card at factoring and you'll
probably add a squeeze a little bit more
at yourself yeah very excited to chuck
this in a test system and get testing
shortly all right that leaves us with
one box it's a very heavy box so
hopefully it has some good stuff for us
we've already done very well out of this
episode though so not sure I can top
what we've already received okay well
maybe it will now we're talking
and you or ass brand rx 580 so we have
not won our X 580 but now finally I have
to so I can do some crossfire testing if
I wanted to that's cool well oh oh okay
brace yourselves you ready that's did it
uh
damn I was not expecting either of these
cards I had no idea gigabyte sent these
I've been asking for one of these for so
long so many guys have got their hands
on that Brian from tech CD got his
before me and he's been gloating ever
since and I've been dying to get my
hands I want it's such an awesome
looking card and I have one awesome well
I'll probably be prioritizing the
reviews for this card while I'm testing
and rx5 84 that big comparison but yeah
I'm not going to end it there let's take
a look at these cards I can't help
myself I do want to go wrap this up and
get benchmarking but I can't not show
you guys these cards if you've made it
this far in the video you deserve to see
them wowie
oh that's so cute look it's got a little
copper insert that's actually a really
cool looking card they've used plastic
for the fan shroud rather than the thin
aluminium which I don't actually mind
it's probably a little bit more durable
and the element in the aluminum seems to
bend quite easily when you push it
whereas the plastic just pops back does
the same job really get all this stuff
off it
yeah I'll give you guys a good look at
the card but that that's really nice
that card don't think it's as heavy
nowhere near as heavy as the Sapphire
card but having said that the cooling
looks very substantial anyway and it
looks like there's at least there's at
least four copper heat pipes that run
the length of the card multiple heat
sinks in there hello you guys can see
that here's the Sapphire model for
comparison so I can pick them both up so
it sort of similar size the Sapphire
definitely seems a bit more weighty so I
have to check them on the scale and see
but the gigabyte card looks like it's
about three centimeters longer you can
see that the cooler overhangs the PCB by
about four centimeters or so and it's
got that yeah that cute little copper
insert there which doesn't do a whole
lot I don't think it's kind of thermal
pad on the back of it but yeah it'll
make sure there's no heat trapped on the
back side of the PCB behind the GPU I'm
not sure if you get by to making any
bold claims with this model but it looks
cool anyway very cool indeed
and then there'll be some RGB lighting
here you got your fans stop there and
looks like this cymbal lighting here as
well which is cool but you usually only
get that on the higher-end models so
yeah very nice i RX 580 card there now
time for this guy well the box itself is
very heavy so I'm sure the card inside
is also very heavy he's indeed very
heavy check that out that is a serious
graphics card so it looks very much like
the 1080 horas card that I looked at
probably that a month or so ago now
probably bit longer than actually six
weeks ago checked out the horas 1080
extreme edition and this is the 1080 TI
extreme edition so other than the
upgraded memory and GPU I'd say the card
is pretty much the same product which is
a good thing to the other card is
probably one of the best Tenet's I'd
seen
and you start that massive copper insert
in the back which if anything just looks
really really cool in my opinion looks
really nice in your case like that
you've got some LED lights glowing
across so that makes very very cool
effect which I did show in that review
and yeah as I mentioned Brian got this
before me the bugger and he was blown
away by said it was much faster than the
founded Edition card ran cooler
overclocked better had more Headroom in
the power targets and stuff like that
and just all around a very awesome kind
I think the premiums too steep either I
think we're only paying I think it's
about 50 us moreover the cheapest 1080s
which used like the reference cooler so
for $50 us when you're already spending
700 that's not too bad considering what
you get in this card and these are
actually both very heavy here's a bit of
a technical analysis the gigabyte card
might be slightly heavier but they're
both well over a kilo I can tell you
that much I guess somewhere like 1300 to
1400 grams somewhere around there enough
fitted tip the one and a half kilos but
yeah very very heavy graphics cards
indeed and they will put your PCI
Express slot to the test
well I almost wasn't going to do this
episode today I was just going to open
these boxes and get on with the rx 580
testing but I'm glad I did because there
was some very very cool hardware inside
plenty of graphics cards it's probably
the best unboxing in terms of what I've
received I've done on the channel ever
so some very cool motherboards from
azurite plus that bonus
Rison 5 cpu which I will be using in a
build so thank you very much as rock for
that greatly appreciated and yeah plenty
of very cool graphics cards I can't
believe to any day you get a pair of
1080 T eyes it's probably a pretty good
day you're doing well there of course
the only downside to all this is I have
a heap of work to do now I already have
a lot of work now I have a lot more but
it all will be fun and hopefully you
guys enjoy the content I'll throw up a
poll you guys can let me know which one
of these two rx 580 cards you think I
should use in that comparison probably
leaning towards the gigabyte card at
this point but I will test both of them
and see if there is any actual
difference in terms of performance I
will be testing out of the box cards so
factory overclocked cards against a
factory overclocked card so I think the
1060 I'll be getting I think is the MSI
gaming X plus model but that hasn't
arrived yet so not entirely sure what
new 1060 model I'll be getting the old
one of course was the EVGA for the win I
think I'm probably going to leave it at
that I don't know how long this episodes
go on for at this point but it feels
like I've been doing this for the better
half of half a day at this point so
that's it for this episode hope you guys
enjoyed all the very cool hardware but
we've got to unbox I very much enjoyed
it very excited about it all and can't
wait to get testing so I'm your host
Steve see you next time guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
