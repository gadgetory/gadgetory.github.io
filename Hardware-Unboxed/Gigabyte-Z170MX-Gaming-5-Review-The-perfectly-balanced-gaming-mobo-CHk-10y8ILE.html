base build a few weeks ago if you didn't
shame on you
go and check it out right now there were
a few really cool components featured in
that build and one such component that
really deserves its own review is the
nifty little gigabyte Zed 170 MX gaming
5 with around a dozen micro ATX at 170
motherboards to pick from you might be
wondering what made this gigabyte board
stand out to me gigabyte offers just two
micro ATX of 170 motherboards the Zed
170 MX gaming 5 and the cheaper Zed 170
m d3h priced at 150 u.s. or 260 AUD
gaming 5 board cost a bit more around
30% more in fact for that money you get
USB 3.1 optical audio out a much better
onboard audio solution and a better
board design for multi GPUs which was a
key selling point for the julno
new-build looking further abroad we find
limited competition for the gaming 5
the closest thing is the ace sue said
170 m a d3 but a 125 dollars it's a good
bit cheaper but it's also very much an
inferior product in almost every regard
meanwhile the flagship offering from a
suit
crashed the $200 barrier at a whopping
220 US dollars or hard-to-swallow 360
Australian dollars that price you get a
board with many of the same or
equivalent features so you start to see
why we went with the gigabyte 7 117 MX
gaming 5 out of the box all motherboards
dining the Zed 170 chipset will have 6
SATA 6 gigabits per second ports at
least half a dozen USB 3 ports as the
chipset supports up to 10 dual PCIe x 16
slots Gigabit Ethernet and some kind of
HD audio additionally there's an m2 port
that can accommodate up to 80 millimeter
long SSDs offering the full pcie 3.0
times for bandwidth including the
package of four very cool-looking silver
SATA cables and these are a nice touch
to give the board a very premium look
for those wondering these can be
purchased separately online from places
such as eBay they'll expect to pay a bit
more than the traditional red or black
cables in total there are seven USB 3
ports on offer three of which have down
in the back panel
gigabyte is bolster package with a pair
of USB 3.1 ports which includes a type A
and type C port on the i/o panel not
just that but through the use of intel's
USB AF certified controller this board
is also thunderbolt ready to upgraded
from the more standard dual PCIe x 16
slot configuration a three PCIe x 16
slots but of course just the primary
slide is wired for the full time 16
bandwidth which will be offered when
using a single graphics card the second
slot is hardwired 2 x 8 bandwidth and
when using SLI or crossfire both the
primary and secondary cards will run at
times 8 bandwidth which has no negative
impact on performance finally the third
PCIe x 16 slot is why at the times for
bandwidth and assuming you can use two
dual slot graphics cards it won't be
accessible anyway a key feature of the
z170 MX gaming 5 is the realtek ALC 1150
audio codec which has been spiced up
using the sound blaster Xfire mp3
software suite also included is a Texas
Instruments beurre Brown operational
amplifier along with the high quality
audio capacitors an audio noise guard
with fancy LED trace path lighting the
killer 80 2201 Gigabit Ethernet
controller is a decent solution but I
would have been just as happy with the
Intel Gigabit LAN found on the cheaper
d3h so don't see this as a noteworthy
upgrade still that isn't to say others
weren't find extra value in the killer
network controller so there you have it
features wires the gigabyte Zed 170 MX
gaming phibes well equipped with high
quality parts the board itself also
looks great even if it is another black
and red themed board layout is excellent
and this is important for a compact
micro ATX board the only disappointing
aspect of the design is lack of useful
buttons for enthusiasts such as a power
and reset button along with the CMOS
Clear button and an LED diagnostic
display would have been a nice touch
still given the price and gigabytes
focus on features such as the USB DAC
for stable voltage being thunderbolt
ready and all those quality audio
features we can forgive them for
excluding these onboard buttons when it
comes to benchmarking we aren't gonna
waste your time by comparing the Zed 170
MH scammy phone's memory application
gaming or even storage performance with
others
170 or any other Intel 100 series
motherboards for that matter rather
let's take a brief look at the
overclocking performance and features
recently I've mostly been using Azeroth
Asus and MSI motherboards all of which
have great UF ease and while I would say
gigabytes version on the zeb 170 MX
gaming 5 it's just as good it did take
some getting used to the menu system
there are plenty of customizable options
but working at where they all live is a
bit tricky at first where I'm used to as
rockiness oozes OC Tweaker type menus
where although overclocking related
options are under the one roof gigabyte
splits things like CPU memory and
voltage options across separate menus
which I have to admit makes things a
little tricky making the overclock a
little more difficult was the fact that
I only had on hand a core i5 6600 K
processor that I bought a few days prior
to testing so I haven't yet worked out
its own limits therefore I started with
gigabytes performance upgrade feature to
see how easy it would be for novice
users to extract extra performance from
their system frequencies ranging from 4
point 2 gigahertz up to 4.6 gigahertz
are available unfortunately my 6600
caged chip wasn't stable using the
highest option and I had to settle for
the 4.5 gigahertz setting which is
almost a 30% increase over the base
cloth and 15% higher than the max turbo
clock based on user overclocking reports
in the 6600 K most seem to reach at
least 4 point 5 gigahertz with the
ceiling being around 4.6 to 4.8
gigahertz at 4.5 TB hurts the CPU
temperature never went about 55 degrees
when placed on the full load we'll be
using the thermal take water 3.0 ring
RGB 240 all-in-one liquid cooler
unfortunately no matter how much messing
around with voltages and other tweakable
settings I wasn't able to get the Zeb
170 MX game e5 my new 6600 K is stable
at over 4.5 gigahertz
even with the B core of 1.4 which was
disappointing other tweakable settings
such as the extreme memory profile works
well we had no trouble loading the more
aggressive profile and I Kingston HyperX
savage ddr4 3000 memory in my opinion
the gigabyte Zeb 117 mhm gave me 5
offers the perfect balance of features
and price probably the best of any micro
ATX dev 170 motherboard available today
and now it's late last year it's a
relative newcomer and if I was shopping
for a micro ATX ed 170 motherboard for a
gaming rig and
certainly be my number one choice when
compared to similarly priced board such
as the a drop step 170 M extreme poor
and a su step 170 M plus the gigabyte
sev 170 MX k me fibers without a
question better overall package gigabyte
off as a better audio solution and what
is arguably a better network controller
for gaming though I'm very much on the
fence about that one does every 170 MX
gaming 5 also does pack a better power
delivery design which means you should
achieve higher overclocks
the way I've cost lucked out here
overall it's my opinion that the
gigabyte board is of a higher quality as
well which for me further helps to
justify the slight price premium
honestly I have to say I'm a little
surprised by the price particularly
given how much it Zeus is asking for the
ROG Maximus 8 gene which for the most
part isn't a superior board certainly
not to the extent that the 40% price
premium could be justified overall
gigabyte has put together very solid
package with the z170 MX gaming 5 and I
expect it will satisfy any gamer hoping
to build a compact micro ATX gaming
machine as always I'm your host Matt and
thanks for checking out the gigabyte
said 170 MX gaming fine with me
also remember you can check out the
written version of this review and all
of our other reviews at our website
Harbor and box com have a great day and
I'll see you next time when I overclock
or laying on my 6700 K so hard it gives
up its offshore accounts</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
