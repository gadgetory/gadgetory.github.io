bit different from the norm for those of
you who come here for product reviews
and in-depth benchmark comparisons all
that type of stuff this video might not
be of interest however for those who've
you been asking for set up to as and
behind-the-scenes stuff well for ever
really since the channel started this
should be of interest I mentioned this
sort of stuff in the unboxing series but
for those of you who missed it almost
all the videos such as the one you're
watching right now a shot in this room
it's not a big room but it's not small
either it's 6 meters by 4 meters and
right now it's storing the majority of
our product boxes and the gear we use
for testing about six months ago I built
the shelves you can see behind us that
as shelves they're quite good for
storing products on but they also as a
secondary function are quite good for a
set there's certainly more interesting
than the white ball that we used to use
some of you guys that have been subject
to the channel for a while will probably
remember the first year or so of the
videos where we just had the white wall
behind us and quite a few of you
suggested that we should do some shelves
or something with some products on there
just to make it a bit more interesting
and so that's what we did so this is
where the majority of the presenting
takes place but it isn't where we
benchmark and test all the products that
we do end up reviewing that's done
upstairs in a slightly larger space the
only problem with that space being that
it isn't complete and utter mess we
built to the office or I built the
office up there years and years ago now
and at the time I was doing something
completely different and has that
changed we need to make a space for Matt
and stuff like that things got torn out
didn't really get put back properly and
it just became yeah a huge mess so the
mission over the past few weeks has been
a tear it all out completely rebuild
something that's neater and more
importantly more functional and so
that's what i'll be showing you the
beginnings of today so this episode is
all about the mess
so guys this is the benchmark lab where
all the action takes place it's a
massive massive mess at the moment I
mean currently in the process of pulling
it all apart and rebuilding it but I
thought before I do that I might show
you guys what I did have and what I plan
to change it to so at the moment I've
already started pulling a few things
down and apart you can see under the
window here of torn off there was a
small desk there this is the main desk
here it's a real mess now I built this
quite a few years ago I probably have
some photos I can throw up that shot
when it was finished and how it worked
back then but yeah it's not really
suitable for how we do things now
basically the main middle monitor here
is my monitor that I work off and then
these side monitors other monitors I
benchmark on and each side monitor had
two separate built-in test systems that
I put in here that's a saved s space so
that I could I test off these monitors
on the side it worked quite well for a
while that we've moved back to using
actual cases for testing now so this is
a 59 60 X system here you all know this
one so I got undergoing a few
modifications at the moment down on the
floor if you can kind of see that is
that's the core i7 6660 700k test rig
and then up the top there's the core i3
6100 t-test system we've got the old
Haswell rig there a few other systems
over there
and you know the shelves are pretty bare
at the moment I'm just in the process of
cleaning them all out a lot of this
stuff will go downstairs to the studio
before I build the new ones and over
here so these these shelves here did
have doors on them so I could close it
off and looked quite neat except that
was kind of a mistake because I pretty
much spent all day opening and closing
the doors constantly which drive me
crazy so in the end I took them off
haven't removed the hinges as you can
see and I plan on putting shelves the
whole length across this wall here and
it'll be similar styles or what's in the
studio downstairs because they work
really well for putting products on the
shelves and storing things that we're
working on and this little weed shelf
here was initially their store my
graphics cards or store the graphics
cards probably I know for a shelf but
this is about a quarter of the crappiest
cards that we currently have and that
we're just getting stacked in there it
wasn't great for the cards themselves
and it made finding cards a bit of a
challenge so I've got a different I
think what we're going to do is on this
wall just here it's a bit kind of focus
it's about I think that's about a meter
and a half and I'm going to put like
just shelves across and have the
graphics cards sitting facing outwards
on them so that should work pretty well
so you're these drawers here I'm not
going to use drawers anymore either few
things left in those a couple of heat
sinks yeah there have been empty now so
I'm going to get rid of those you guys
might recognize these cases down here
one of the first custom builds we did on
the channel you're not doing a whole lot
these days got the split system at the
top there
the server at the moments down there
again it's a real mess but we'll fix
that up a lot of stuff at the moment is
in tubs so the tubs all along here and a
one giant mess but what have we got
we've got power supply cables their
power cables in that one so that is the
messy benchmark lab hopefully to be
transformed shortly and I thought I
would film this before I pulled it all
out to show you guys what we sort of
coming from here and i will film the
process of you know building the new one
and here we go with that so I spend most
of my time sitting on the ergo human
right here benchmarking back and forth
back and forth over and over again it's
a lot of fun but on a nice day like
today it's good to look outside it's not
a bad view from the office actually it's
nice to at least look out there and
dream of doing something other than
benchmarking for the day but anyway well
that wasn't pretty but stay tuned
because I will have an update shortly on
the progress and soon we should have
something much better to work with until
then take it easy and I will catch you
guys in tomorrow's video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
