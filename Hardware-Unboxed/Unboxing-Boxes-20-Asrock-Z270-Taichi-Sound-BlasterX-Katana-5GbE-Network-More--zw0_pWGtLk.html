today I have a new episode of unboxing
boxes I'm not actually sure what episode
number we're up to at this point but
I'll work that out afterwards but yeah I
haven't done one of these for a few
weeks now which we were doing it every
week and yeah it took a bit of a break
you know new years and all that sort of
stuff but and I did go away for a short
holiday but anyway now I've got back to
it and there's quite a few boxes this is
about half the boxes I have to get
through at the moment but some of these
products I have to use this week so I
thought it's probably a good time to
unbox them so anyway let's get to it
I'll probably move this big box out of
the way and probably save that for last
and I think this one here looks like a
good starting point just move this
little one alright it's excited and
getting back into the unboxing boxes and
I don't know what happened to my
multi-tool
with the knife on it and somewhere in
the office but I couldn't find it so
I've just got a steak knife alright here
we go
okay very cool what we have here or some
I've been dying to get my hands on these
boards particularly this one which I'll
get to in a moment why alright I suppose
I should probably take this board out of
the box while we talk about it but it is
the asrock fatality is there - 7 T
performance professional rather
professional gaming so that's the
fatalities n270 professional gaming i7
so it's a bit of a mouthful so yeah
they've just got well Z to 70 gaming i7
you can probably drop the fatality part
we got a screw for the m2 slot some SATA
cables high-bandwidth sli bridge more m2
screws
pair of aerials so you must have a
bluetooth and Wi-Fi on this board
cool aiyo shield more SATA cables
standard single link SLI bridge and a
post card so if you plan on going on a
trip with your motherboard to celebrate
buying it you can send a card back home
uh anyway this is what we really care
about so it looks very similar to the Z
217 gaming k-6 board that we've already
looked at or I'm using for testing
anyway very similar but some differences
are you get a pair of em two slots here
stacked one after the other along with a
third here so that's three ultra m2
ports that's that's pretty insane you
get I suppose three samsung 960 pro one
terabyte drives or yeah oh is that
coming two terabyte anyway that would be
that'd be awesome
overkill really but yeah why not
and what is really cool about this board
which I can't test right now but I am
really really really keen to get to is
the five gigabit lan connection which
uses your standard rj45 cat6 cables so
you know that's five times faster than
the gigabit connection of which there
are two as well on this board so you get
a pair of two gigabit lan connections
which do use intel LAN controllers or
land chips and then the five gigabit
chip which I'm not actually sure what
drives that I don't know a whole lot
about it you had a part in the fact that
this board has it and I can't test it
but I'm happy to have it and yeah you
get a there's a em another there's a
fourth m2 slot which is occupied by a
Wi-Fi cards that's an 802 11 AC Wi-Fi
card with Bluetooth support so that's
pretty cool right on the box
so the networking on this board is
pretty insane you also get USB 3.1 type
C and type a what else have we got your
standard output ports you get to the
Sound Blaster cinema 3 audio which is
very high
and audio solution using our the new
real tech I'll say I think it's the
12:20 codec I'd have to check that don't
quote me but I think that's it and you
get the am shielding and added that the
steel what are we called on the steel
shields around the PCI Express slots
which stops them from flexing and also
provides a bit of a em shielding or am i
shielding so that's pretty cool the USB
3 header on the board plenty of SATA
ports a pair of SATA Express ports but
you're never gonna use those and yeah
this has all the I think it's the aura
lighting they call it or is that
gigabyte I might be getting a bit my
wires crossed there but anyway that's a
cool cool mother what I don't know the
price in US or other markets it's yet to
be released this board so yeah given the
the five Gigabit Ethernet on it I'm very
keen to see what they price this brought
up yeah so anyway that's cool and then
of course we have the z2 70 Taichi model
and I have the x99 Tai Chi Tai Chi Chi
Chi board that we used in that Corp III
build and yes still in use today
obviously and that's an awesome board
really like it this one looks very
similar you've got the sort of a big
earring work design on the PCB if you
can see that and yeah it's the 270
version so it's actually it's sort of
positioned as a high-end but
budget-friendly board and the pricing is
pretty good it's 240 us which given the
feature said I think is pretty
reasonable or that works out to be about
330 Aussie and compared to this board
you get many of the same features as the
the gaming i7 version but that 5 Gigabit
LAN unfortunately has been dropped and
the creative audio or the cinema 3 audio
has been changed for purity sound for so
not not a huge downgrade
and you still get the three you still
get those three m dot two ports you get
the artis or RGB lighting you get a
twelve phase power design you get those
steel slots for the PCIe times sixteen
USB 3.1 and all that good stuff the
Wi-Fi and all that sort of stuff the end
to Intel Wi-Fi adapter so yeah very cool
board and I'll probably end up reviewing
that at some point all featuring a build
who knows I'll get on to this sort of
ragged looking box so it's had a bit of
a leak oh yes this is the final piece to
my the Tower 900 puzzle hopefully you
guys saw my video or the explaining all
the bits and bobs that are going to go
into the Tower 900 bill which if you can
see is just here and yeah this is the
VGA block for the gtx 1070 that's going
to go into that bills so the pacific v
gtx 10 series founders edition block and
i'll be working that on a founders
edition GeForce graphics card so yeah
that's pretty cool we've seen this on
the channel before we used the same
block for the tour p3 bill which used a
GTX 1080 it's a very very impressive
looking block so there you go all nice
and shiny the liquid flowing through
here looks really cool I'm not actually
sure what color liquid I'll be using for
that part of the loop because I'll be
using two separate loops that build so
the CPU and the GPU will be on two
separate loops and the liquids will be
black and white actually the other day I
finally got the black liquid which I've
been waiting for and I did unbox this
without you guys not something I'm proud
of so just got me in a weak moment and I
had to check it out
and yeah it's it's black liquid kind of
looks like oil I so used oil but anyway
that's gonna be pretty cool tool that
will be coming up probably later this
week
alright let's dive into this one quickly
what do we have here a gigabyte headset
okay so I know it's not their first
headset ever but it's not something you
often see from gigabyte the extreme
gaming XH 300 gaming headset have to say
it looks pretty cool on the box and
you'll be relieved to know that it is
RGB so yeah it's a gaming product then
places to throw things okay so you got
like a fabric cable tie with the extreme
gaming name on it you get an extreme
gaming badge which is pretty cool that's
just a little manual I have no idea what
the price of these is going to be set
out I don't believe they're on sale yet
does this work
no I didn't I don't think I broke it
some reason it rotates easily now why
don't we got what have we got here
unless I'm missing something I can't see
which is meant to be left and right I
guess that the mic is on the left side
but being it they're completely around
and very symmetrical on this fold either
way let's move on I'd say they come on
this way okay they're not over here but
they feel comfortable after a very very
short fitting the mic is a bendy pliable
that's pretty cool I haven't actually
done any research yet so I'm just sort
of guessing here but it looks like you
can either use it via USB or the
old-fashioned way with the audio jacks
so I'm not 100% sure if that's true or
that this could just be for the lighting
so you may have to use them both
together if we review it obviously all
those details will be revealed and he
does have an on/off button I don't know
if that's just for the Michael the whole
headset yeah not really that clear just
as on or off and what I imagine is a
volume wheel for the headphones
themselves yeah I mean they're they're
pretty comfortable me a light BAM look
to stay on pretty well
they look quite good decent they've kind
of light and plasticky feeling but I
have no idea what the price is so it's
hard to criticize them for that anyway
gigabytes new extreme gaming headset
more to come shortly I'm sure all right
we're getting through this pretty well
time for a small box that's quite funny
actually I just went and bought one of
these the other day the G 4560 the new
Pentium processor with hyper-threading
the KB Lake model that's quite funny I
bought one of these because there's
quite a few tests I want to do with it
and yeah I'm pretty sure I bought the
4560 model that's probably I think
that's the only one available at the
moment
anyway I have two of these now so that's
cool I suppose I might use one in a
build and the other one I'll use for
benchmarking but anyway that's yeah very
popular processor at the moment I can't
remember the pricing I've told my head
but it's like 80 Aussie for this
processor it runs that I think three
point
yeah 3.5 gigahertz 3 megabyte level
cache cache AHA and yeah it's a cable a
processor it's essentially a core i3
because it has hyper-threading so 2
cores 4 threads because of the hyper
threading support so yeah interesting I
don't know why Intel's done that they've
may that you've got core i3 models
obviously they all have all the core i3
s have hyper threading and the lowest
team model drops down from the four
megabyte level 3 to the 3 megabyte level
3 and then all the Pentiums are the same
with a 3 megabyte level 3 that is
clocked you know 100 200 megahertz lower
so they're essentially core i3 s now
yeah
but with lower prices and lower clock
speeds so that's good
alrighty to a left to go and I'm pretty
sure I know what these are both Corsair
packages I mentioned it a little while
ago on the channel in some video I can't
recall now but basically Corsair
approached me and they wanted to sponsor
our new core i7 KB like test machine
which I primarily use for testing GPUs
but
can also be used some time at home to
test CPUs even over sort of separate
system for doing that but yeah they
wanted to sponsor that system provide
the case power supply cooling storage
what else was there
memory of course so yeah I said why not
more than happy to let you guys provide
all the gear for that good eye vision -
all in one liquid cooler and this is a
product I can recommend because I've
used it well I think I've used the
version two in one system and the
version the original version I've got
I've got about two or three of those
units in different systems and they're
awesome they're really good quality I
haven't had a single problem with them
yet and yeah I'm looking forward to
sticking this in the new cable a core i7
77 ok test system keep that thing cool
hopefully it can keep it really cool at
like what 4.9 gigahertz so that one
probably the 6700 ki test at 4.5
gigahertz and the new system I might
wind up to your 4.8 or 4.9 if I can get
it really stable and running at
reasonable respectable temperatures at
4.9 that's what I'll go with my
processor does that on 1.3 volts and you
can get it you can get it working at 5
gigahertz in Windows and benchmarking it
seems stable but it runs really hot even
with a liquid cooler so yeah that's what
I'll be going for long-term but anyway
oh this one's heavy so must be a power
supply yep it's a power supply we have
the our MX 750 watt or our m7 50 X
rather and yeah that's a power supply
that I have never used before so I don't
know a whole lot about but I can guess
that'll be expensive high quality and
work quite well and yes 750 what will be
way more than we're going to ever need
in the graphics card benchmark system I
think you could probably get away with
running a pair of Titan XP cards off
that with an overclocked core i7
processor you'd power draw and be around
600 watts there so I mean it's getting
up there but what's this thing what is
it rated at 80 plus gold okay yeah that
would be more than enough to run that
pretty safely over a long period of time
I would say
ah I'm getting all carried away thinking
we're done and the big box I stuck down
here it's still sitting there well so
far I can tell you it's a red box and it
has things that would suggest it's
something to do with audio down Sound
Blaster X katana actually you probably
can't hear me very well with that in the
way Sound Blaster X katana I don't know
much about this creatives new sound bar
it's not on sale yet in the US or
Australia as far as I know but to the
creative still suggests retail price of
thrown at us which is quite expensive
but it all depends on the quality of the
sound but from what I've been told it's
extremely high quality it's 75 watt RMS
so it's gonna have some punch about it
yeah so I won't go into too much detail
about that one right now because I don't
have all the facts and figures in front
of me but there will be a review on this
on the channel shortly so I won't bother
unboxing it now and drag this out and
any longer but yeah I think this will be
a pretty cool product so that was quite
a productive unboxing boxes episode we
got two really awesome motherboards
really interested to test this one
although I can't at the moment I have to
get another board and probably use a
crossover cable or get a switch that
will support this thing I'm really keen
to test that five Gigabit Ethernet I
mean you can safely assume it's going to
be five times faster than what you get
out of a gigabit connection providing
have the storage that can handle you
know that kind of our performance to
learn from on both systems yeah that's
gonna be cool to test we've got the
final piece of the puzzle for the tower
nine hundred bills that's going to be
great
Crave's speaker which I'll have to do a
lot of testing playing around listen to
music and then we can eventually review
that pretty much the same goes for this
probably do a bit of gaming
might catch up with Brian from check
your city over the weekend and play some
games so that'll be cool
and then these guys for the cable a core
i7 build very keen to get them in the
system get that built the probably video
of that the only thing I'm waiting for
and that is actually the case I've got
everything from Corsair there there was
some problem with the case they have
custom ordered that locally from a shop
and I'll probably have that later this
week so then I can get that video done
for the following week and then this
this guy which I well since I already
had it probably have some content on the
channel by the time you see this I'm not
sure it depends on how everything goes
but I am right now as we speak working
on a big huge benchmark comparison for
this which will be probably coming up
next week and that'll be comparing
gaming performance in like 16 games
against the core i3 Core i5 and core i7
so that will be worth checking out so
keep your eyes peeled for that one
anyway that does it for this episode of
unboxing boxes hope you enjoyed seeing
all this new hardware arrive and yeah
there'll be more of it to come so I'll
catch you guys later
