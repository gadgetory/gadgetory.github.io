today i have a new episode of unboxing
boxes I'm not actually sure what episode
number we're up to at this point but
I'll work that out afterwards but yeah I
haven't done one of these for a few
weeks now which we were doing it every
week and yeah it took a bit of a break
you know new years and all that sort of
stuff but and I did go away for a short
holiday but anyway now I've got back to
it and there's quite a few boxes this is
about half the boxes I have to get
through at the moment but some of these
products I have to use this week so I
thought it's probably a good time to
unbox them so anyway let's get to it
I'll probably move this big box out of
the land probably save that for last and
I think this one here looks like a good
starting point remove this little one
all right it's excited and getting back
into the unboxing boxes and I don't know
what happened to my multi-tool with the
knife on it it's somewhere in the office
be I couldn't fight so I've just got a
steak knife all right here we go okay
very cool what we have here or some
dying to get my hands on these words
particularly this one which I'll get to
in a moment why alright I suppose I
should probably take this board out of
the box while we talk about it but it is
the asrock taste allottees edge 27 t
performance professional rather
professional gaming so that's the
fatalities then 270 professional gaming
I seven so it's a bit of a mouthful see
they've just got well dead 270 gaming is
seven you can probably drop the fatality
part we got a screw for the MDOT to
slice some solder cables high bandwidth
SLI bridge more room two screws pair of
Ariel so you must have Bluetooth and
Wi-Fi on this board cool art I oh
yield more solder cables standard single
link SLI bridge and a postcard so if you
plan on going on a trip with your
motherboard to celebrate buying it you
can send a card back home anyway this is
what we really care about so it looks
very similar to the dead 2 17 gaming
case 6 board that we've already looked
at or I'm using for testing anyway very
similar but some differences are you get
a pair of em two slots here stacked one
after the other along with the 30s that
story ultra m24 sets that's pretty
insane if you get I suppose three
Samsung 960 pro one terabyte drives or
yes I coming two terabyte anyway that
would be that would be awesome overkill
really but yeah why not and what is
really cool about this board which I
can't test right now but I am really
really really keen to get to is the five
Gigabit LAN connection which uses your
standard rj45 cat6 cables so you know
that's five times faster than the
gigabit connection of which there are
two as well on this board so you get a
pair of two gigabit lan connections
which do use intel lan controllers or
land chips and then the five you give it
chip which i'm not actually sure what
drives that i don't know a whole lot
about it yet apart from the fact that
this board has it and i can't test it
but i'm happy to have it and yeah you
get a better em another there's a fourth
hour m2 slot which is occupied by a
Wi-Fi cards that's an 802 11 AC Wi-Fi
card with bluetooth support so that's
pretty cool right out of the box so the
networking on this board is pretty
insane you also get USB 3.1 type C and
Taipei what else have we got your
standard output ports you get to be
sound blaster cinema 3 audio which is a
very high-end audio solution using at
the
the new realtek alc I think it's the
1220 codec I'd have to check that don't
quote me but I think that's it and you
get the am shielding and added dr.
Steele what are we called on the steel
shields around the PCI Express slots
which stops them from flexing and also
provides a bit of am shielding or emi
shielding so that's pretty cool the USB
3 header on the board plenty of SATA
ports a pair of SATA Express bullets but
you're never going to use those and yeah
this has all the advanced the or a
sliding they call it or is like you give
light I might be getting a bit my wires
crossed their it anyway that's a cool
cool mother what I don't know the price
in us or of these markets it's yet to be
released this board so yeah given the
the five gigabit ethernet i I'm very
keen to see what they price is brought
up yeah so anyway that's cool and then
of course we have the Z 270 Tai Chi
model and I have the x 99 tai chi tai
chi tai chi board that we used in that
core p3 build and yes still in use today
obviously and i've been awesome board
really like it this one looks very
similar you've got the sort of the
gearing work design on the PCB if you
can see that and yes the 270 version so
it's actually it's sort of positioned as
a high end but budget-friendly board and
the pricing is pretty good it's 240 us
which given the features that i think is
pretty reasonable or that works have to
be about 330 Ozzy and compared to this
voyage you get many of the same features
as the the gaming i7 version but that
fiber gigabit lan unfortunately has been
dropped and the creative audio or the
cinema 3 audio has been changed for
purity sound for so not not a huge
downgrade and you still get the three
you still get those 3 m 2 ports you get
the artists or RGB
the lighting you got a 12 phase power
design you get those steel slots for the
pcie x 16 USB 3.1 and all that good
stuff they'll wire flies and a lot sort
of stuff the ends up to intel Wi-Fi
adapter so yeah very cool board and i'll
probably end up reviewing that at some
point all featuring the build who knows
I'll get onto this sort of
ragged-looking boss had a bit of a leak
is this is the final piece to my the
tower 900 puzzles hopefully you guys saw
my video or the explaining all the bits
and bobs that are going to go into the
tower 900 bill which if you can see us
just here and yeah this is the vga block
for the GTF 1070 that's going to go in
suffield so the pacific ving GTX 10
series founders edition block and I'll
be working that on a sound of addition
geforce graphics card see that's pretty
cool we've seen this on the channel
before we used the same block for the
tour peter evil which used a gtx 1080
it's a very very impressive looking
block so there you go all nice and shiny
the liquid flowing through here looks
really cool I'm not actually sure what
color liquid i'll be using to that part
of the list because i'll be using two
separate loops that build for the CPU
and the GP you'll be on two separate
loops and the liquids will be black and
white actually the other day I finally
got the black liquid which I've been
waiting for and I did unbox this without
you guys not something I'm proud of so
just got me in a weak moment and I had
to check it out and yeah black liquid
kind of looks like oil I so used oil but
anyway that's going to be pretty cool
part 2 that'll be coming up probably
later this week alright let's dive into
this one quickly what do we have here
a gigabyte headset okay so I know it's
not their first heads than ever but it's
not something you often see from
gigabyte the extreme gaming ex hates 300
gaming headset after say it looks pretty
cool on the box and you will be released
to know that it is RGB so you know it's
a gaming product then running out of
places to throw things okay so you got
like a fabric cable tie with the extreme
gaming name on it you get an extreme
gaming badge which is pretty cool and
though so that's just a little manual I
have no idea what the price of these is
going to be set out and I don't believe
they're on sale yet does this work no i
didn't i don't think i broke it some
reason it rotates easily now that we got
what have we go to you unless I'm
missing something I can't see which is
meant to be left and right I guess that
the mic is on the left side but being at
they're completely around and very
symmetrical on this fold either way I
let's move on I'd say they come on this
way ok they're not over here but I feel
comfortable after a very very short
fitting the mic is a bendy pliable
that's pretty cool i haven't actually
done any research yet so I'm just sort
of guessing here but it looks like you
can either use it via USB all at the old
fashioned way with the audio jacks so
not one hundred percent sure if that's
true or that this could just be for the
lighting so you may have to use them
both together if we review it obviously
all those details will be revealed and
here you just have an on/off button I
don't know if that's just for the
Michael the whole headset yeah not
really that clear to sit on or off and
what I imagine it a volume wheel for the
headphones themselves yeah I mean
they're they're pretty comfortable
they're light BAM look to stay on pretty
well
they look quite good decent they've the
kind of light and plasticky feeling but
I have no idea what the prices so it's
hard to criticize them for that anyway
gigabyte's new extreme gaming headset
more to come shortly i'm sure all right
we're getting through this pretty well
time for a small box that's quite funny
actually I just went and bought one of
these the other day the G 45-60 the new
pentium processor with five interring
the kb lake model that's quite funny i
bought one of these because there's
quite a few tests I what I do with it
and yeah I'm pretty sure i bought the 45
60 mo that's probably I think I say only
one available at the moment anyway I
have two of these now so that's cool I
suppose I might use one in a bill and
the other one I'll use for benchmarking
but anyway that's yeah very popular
processor at the moment I can't remember
the price on my head but it's like 80 of
these for this processor it runs that I
think three points yeah 3 point 5
gigahertz 3 megabyte level cache cache
ah and yeah it's a cable a processor
that's essentially a core i3 because it
has hyperthreading so two calls for
threads because of the hyper threading
support so you're interesting I don't
know why Intel's done that they've made
that you've got core i three models
obviously they all all the core i3 have
hyper threading and the lowest team
model drops down from the four megabyte
level 3 to the three megabyte level 3
and then all the Pentiums are the same
with a 3 megabyte level 3 that is
clocked you know 120 megahert slower so
they're essentially core i3 is now yes
but with lower prices and lower clock
speeds that's good alrighty to left to
go and I'm pretty sure I know what these
are both corsair packages I mentioned it
a little while ago on the channel in
some video I can't recall now but
basically corsair approached me and they
wanted to sponsor on you call
7kb lake test machine which i primarily
use for testing GPUs but can also be
used some time at home assessed CPU them
neither sort of separate system for
doing that but yeah they wanted to
sponsor that system provide the case
power supply cooling storage what else
was the memory of course so yeah I said
why not more than happy to let you guys
provide all the gear for that good I
version 2 all-in-one liquid cooler and
this is the product i can recommend
because i've used it so i think i've
used the version 2 in one system and the
version the original version i've got
about two or three of those units in
different systems and they're awesome
they're really good quality I haven't
had a single problem with them yet and
yeah i'm looking forward to sticking
this in the new cable eight core i7 72
ok test system keep that thing cool
hopefully you can keep it really cool at
like what 4.9 gigahertz so that was
probably the 67 are ok i test at 4.5
gigahertz and the new system i might
wind up to your 4.8 or 4.9 if i can get
it really stable and running at
reasonable respectable temperatures the
4.9 that's what i'll go with my
processor does that on one point three
volts and you can get it you can get it
working it's five gigahertz in windows
and benchmarking it seems stable but it
runs really hot even with a liquid
cooler so i don't know if that's what
i'll be going for long term if it anyway
or front heavy so must be a power supply
yep it's now salite we have the rmx 750
watt or RM 750 x rather and yeah that's
a power supply that i have never used
before so and a whole lot about but i
can guess it'll be expensive high
quality and work quite well and they're
750 what will be way more than we're
going to ever need in the graphics card
bench my system i think you could
probably get away with running a pair of
tight and XP cards off that with an
overclocked core i7 processor you'd
power draw be around 600 watts there so
I mean it's getting up there but what's
this thing what is it rated up 80 plus
gold ok yeah that would be more than
enough to run that pretty safely over a
long period of time
would say ah i'm getting all carried
away thinking we're done and the big box
i stuck down here still sitting there
when we got here well so far i can tell
you it's a red box and it has things
that would suggest it's something to
with audio was upside down sound blaster
x katana actually probably can't hear me
very well with that in the way sound
blaster x katana I don't know much about
this creatives new sound bar it's not on
sale yet in the US or Australia as far
as I know but to the creative still
suggests retail prices thrown at us
which is quite expensive but it all
depends on the quality of the sound bar
from what I've been told it's extremely
high quality it's 75 watt rms so it's
going to have some punch about it yes I
won't go into too much detail about that
one right now because I don't have all
the facts and figures in front of me but
there will be a review on this on the
channel shortly so I won't bother
unboxing it now and drag this out any
longer yeah I think this will be pretty
cool product so that was quite a
productive unboxing boxes episode we got
to really awesome motherboards really
interested to test this one although i
can't at the moment I've actually get
another board and probably use a
crossover cable or get a switch that
will support this thing me I'm really
keen to test that five Gigabit Ethernet
I mean you can safely assume it's going
to be five times faster than what you
get out of a gigabit connection
providing have the storage that can
handle that kind of our performance to
learn from on both systems yeah that's
going to cool to test we've got the
final piece of the puzzle for the tower
nine hundred bills that's going to be
great crave speaker which I'll have to
do a lot of testing playing around
listen to music and then we can
eventually review that pretty much the
same goes for this probably do a bit of
gaming might catch up with Brian from
check yo city over the weekend and play
some games
that'll be cool and in these guys for
the cable eight core i7 build very keen
to get them in the system get that built
by probably video of that the only thing
I'm waiting for when those actually the
case I've got everything from cause
there there there was some problem with
the case they have custom ordered that
locally from a shop and I'll probably
have that later this week so then I can
get that video done for the following
week and then this this guy which I will
since I already had it I'll probably
have some content on the channel by the
time you're serious i'm not sure it
depends on how everything goes but i am
right now as we speak working on a big
huge benchmark comparison for this which
will be probably coming up next week and
that'll be comparing gaming performance
in like 16 games against the core i3
core i5 and core i7 so that will be
worth checking out so keep your eyes
peeled for that one anyway that does it
for this episode of unboxing boxes hope
you enjoyed seeing all this new hardware
arrive and yeah they'll be more of it to
come so i'll catch you guys later
