unboxed I'm your host Matt and today
we're taking a look at Intel's later 6th
generation Core i7 6700 K CPU it seems a
bit odd introducing you guys to the 6
gen core i7 when just a month ago we
introduced the 5th gen i7 for the very
first time as it turns out Broadwell is
just a stepping stone of the 14
nanometer design process and due to
complications with the manufacturing
process the series never really
materialized a lengthy delay in rolling
Broadwell out meant it became right on
the heels of skylake Intel's brand new
14 nanometer tech we're Broadwell is
essentially a hazard die shrink skylake
is an updated microarchitecture that
brings with it a new socket and support
for ddr4 memory as you might have
guessed the new socket means that sky
like won't be compatible with
motherboard sporting a 9 Series chipset
although the 1151 socket isn't backwards
compatible with house all CPUs you can
still use your LGA 1150 CPU cooler as
the location in the mounting holes
remains unchanged the introduction of
ddr4 and intel's mainstream platform
means high memory frequencies can now be
achieved though it is interesting to
note that ddr3 support still exists
therefore it's likely the budget boards
using the be 150 chipset for example
might use more affordable ddr3 memory at
this point I should also mention the
skylight features a dual channel memory
controller today Intel is taking the
covers off to new skylake processors the
core i7 6700 K and the core i5 6600 K
while other six generation CPUs are
expected to be released later this year
it's to Google for Intel to kick things
off with their fully unlocked enthusiast
processors as these models generate the
most high for this video we'll be
checking out the core i7 6700 K although
we do also have a video on the more
affordable Core i5 6600 K so be sure to
check that out next the core i7 6700 K
operates at the same 4 gigahertz base
clock is a 4790k the only difference is
in the maximum turbo frequency that's
been capped at 4.2 gigahertz whereas the
4790k can clock as high as 4 point 4
gigahertz like our previous course of
processes the 6,700 k is a quad-core
process of supporting hyper-threading
which means it's up to 8 threads
available the 6700 K receives the same 8
mega by l3 cache is the 4790k and the
PCI Express configuration is also the
same
this means guys still features 16 PCI
Express 3 lanes so a single GPU can
connect to the CPU at a 1 by 16
configuration while a two-way crossfire
SLI will use the 2 by 8 configuration
Intel claims that the 6700 K will
deliver up to 10 percent better
performance when compared to its Haswell
counterpart the 4790k that isn't a
significant claim for a revamped
architecture and we hope to see
reasonable improvements in most of our
tests that being said let's get right
down to it first up we're taking a look
at the Cinebench scores in the
multi-threaded test the 6700 case got a
disappointing 5cb marks less than the
4790k these results are disappointing
because both processors operate at
similar frequencies and it shows a lack
of improvement in instructions per cycle
the single-threaded results were much
the same though for whatever reason the
6700 K was consistently faster by a
small margin
eating out the 4790k by 6 eb marks in
our tests next we tested with what I
assume is pronounced web export which
contains 6 html5 and JavaScript based
workloads the results were much in line
with those who saw and Cinebench
underwhelming performance is very close
to both the 4790k and the 5775 see again
in our Excel test we see very similar
performance to the i7 4790k this time
was slightly slower again I guess Intel
meant it when they said up to 10% better
performance when compared to its Haswell
counterpart there was no surprise of
redemption in the 7-zip benchmark with
the 6700 KS growing 8 percent less than
the 4790k the Photoshop results are
quite disappointing for the new 6700 K
with our custom workload taking more
than 2 seconds longer than the 5775 C
and the 4790k again beating it out
finally the 6700
top our table coming in a whole frame
faster than the 4790k yep that's an
entire frame per second probably nothing
worth writing home about now it's time
to take a look at the integrated
graphics performance which we aren't
expecting too much from but hopefully
there is some improvement
in BioShock Infinite we're pleased to
see the 6700 K beta at the 4790k by a
decent margin don't get me wrong it's
still slow and if these low settings the
game looks like rubbish but at least the
performance is better the performance
didn't compare however to the IRS
performance of the 5775 C hitman
absolution was quite similar however the
6700 K did manage to rein in iris Pro a
little it was also 5 frames faster than
the 4790k game which was good to see in
Tomb Raider the 6700 K was quite a way
ahead at the 4790k a 14 frames per
second advantage however it was well
behind iris Pro on the 5775 C which
managed to compare ibly massive 97
frames per second these integrated
graphics scores aren't bad for the 6700
K and there was slight improvement over
the 4790k
however they're most likely pretty
irrelevant since anyone affording a
flagship processor is probably not
looking to play these games without a
discrete graphics card next up we tested
performance with the GeForce GTX 980
running the same games at the max
quality settings in BioShock expectedly
the 6700 caged performance was exactly
the same as its rivals is this is a GPU
bound game hitman absolution generally
weighs pretty heavily on both the GPU
and the CPU however at the settings we
tested with the tends to be more GPU
dependent as you can see from the
results which are all very similar Metro
Redux is heavy on the CPU and as you can
see there's a noticeable difference
between the 4690k and the 4790k and even
more so to the AMD FX 8350 however if we
look at the fourth fifth and sixth gen
Core i7 processors we see no difference
we used handbrake to assess power
consumption and the results were
slightly better than the 4790k consuming
10% less power so at least we're seeing
an improvement in efficiency from this
sixth gen processor well that was
disappointing to say the least the 6700
K was no faster than the 40 790
and at times due to a 200 megahertz
lower turbo frequency it was actually
slower the years now entails been moving
forward in baby steps jump from Sandy
Bridge to Ivy Bridge and edit around 10%
extra performance at the time everyone
seemed disappointed with such a minor
performance bump but then has or came
along the following year and only
offered another 10% bump at best now we
have skylake tattered is the biggest
step forward since Sandy Bridge from
what we've seen so far performance wise
it's actually one of the smaller steps
forward we've seen in a long time for a
platform that calls in new tube sets and
docks the latest memory technology will
shock to only find 4790k like
performance with virtually nothing
changing in terms of CPU performance
what can we possibly take away from this
first look not much to be honest but we
can say sky like does consume around 10
percent less power to deliver the same
results something we didn't look at in
this video is overclocking and I can
confirm that our retail chip was an
overclocking Beast hitting almost 5
gigahertz without much effort for those
of you interested in finding out more
about 6,700 k's overclocking abilities
please check out our overclocking video
other advantages can be found when
comparing the z170 and z97 chipset
the z170 connected to the CPU using the
DMI 3.0 interface which enabled 20 PCI
Express three lanes opposed to just 8
PCI Express 2 lanes for the z97 so in
theory the Zed 170 should be better for
multi-gpu setups the Zed 170 also
supports 10 USB 3 ports whereas the Zed
97 was limited to just 6 price-wise the
6700 K is said to come in at the same
350 dollar MSRP is the 4790k
which is good news but keep in mind that
you also have to spring for a 100 series
motherboard and ddr4 memory thanks for
joining me for this first exclusive look
