host Steve and today we're doing a
little bit of core i7 70 100x
overclocking just a little bit
I do realize everyone is height for
thread Ripper right now but we're still
a few weeks away from how to show you
any benchmarks so let's focus our
attention on something we can show you
that said I discussed the 1920 X in 1950
XO the new thread ripper parts in
yesterday's video so if you miss that
check it out they do mighty impressive
in the meantime though I slip a few
intel core X tests something together
the way so let's do that
alright so three weeks ago now I certain
see if it was possible to keep the new
Intel Core I 970 100x cooler 4.7
gigahertz without having addy lead the
$1,000 chip in the end I found that
Thermaltake specific RL 360 custom lube
liquid cooling kit was able to keep the
semi 100x in check and temps hovered
around 73 degrees under load which is
acceptable certainly not a bad result
for a 10 core CPU clocked at 4.7
gigahertz though it did push total
system consumption to an insane 375
watts under load
so yeah overclocked is spat out a score
of 2500 21 points which at the time I
deemed quite impressive that said though
aimed at probably a little less
impressed as there 16 core 1950 X
produces a score in excess of 3,000
points so that kind of puts a damper on
my 70 100x overclock anyway a number of
you have demanded I do the same and
overclock the much more affordable six
core Core i7 700 X so that's what I've
done recently we saw how the 700 X
compares to the 7700 K in 30 games and
even overclocked it wasn't very
impressive for the most part as
disappointing as the gaming performance
is productivity is a little more
inspiring in order to stabilize the 4.7
gigahertz overclock on the 700 X we
required a V core of 1.25 volts and this
led to a low temperature of 68 degrees
so just five degrees less than the ten
core part mind you I was using slightly
less voltage as well I should also note
that when stressing the FPU the
temperature spiked up towards 100
degrees and throttling was detected
anyway with the temperatures in check
for the most part I moved on to run a
few quick tests first up around
Cinebench r15 as this has become a
fairly standard benchmark for measuring
CPU performance here the overclocked 700
X produced a multi-threaded score of
fourteen hundred and eighty points with
a single thread score of 191 points and
that's only about a 10% improvement over
the stock result next up I ran blender
and here the render was completed in
twenty three point four seconds which is
faster than a stock core i7 sixty nine
hundred K but again only a 10%
improvement over the out-of-the-box
performance last up I checked
performance using the corona benchmark
and here the test took 144 seconds and
as you guessed it that's a 10%
improvement over the stock performance
so if that's pretty disappointing given
we are squeezing at least 18% more
frequency from the CPU I saw no evidence
of throttling in my tests apart from
that one FPU stress test and the vrm
temps were well within acceptable limits
most telling though was the fact of
power consumption increased by an insane
52% from 236 Watts seen previously
during the cinema r15 multi-threaded
test to an eye-watering 358 watts that's
not really much better than thrown in 75
watts the 10 core part gobbled up
lowering the voltage further led to
crashes so the only way to shed those
what if you will is to lower the
frequency as well anyway at this point
it's hard to tell if the disappointing
performance is down to an issue with the
x-29 motherboard that I use for testing
or if it's just the CPU itself in any
case I can't imagine the results are too
far from the truth and at this point I
have tried two different external
motherboards of admittedly they
admittedly they were both as rock boards
so it would be good to test a board from
a competing brand anyway last week when
I did conduct my 30 game benchmark
comparing the 77 okay and see 100x both
stock and overclocked I found that on
average the seminar X enjoyed just a 5%
boost in performance from the overclock
when gaming that said though the 70
similar case or even less of a gain
though for the most part that CPU is
probably being either GPU limited or
there was a frame cap so the game was
limiting performance that way in any
case it's really starting to look like
overclocking your skylake xcp you simply
isn't worth the added heat and power
draw and well that's where I'm going to
end this rather short video what they
don't like to be benchmarked marathons
