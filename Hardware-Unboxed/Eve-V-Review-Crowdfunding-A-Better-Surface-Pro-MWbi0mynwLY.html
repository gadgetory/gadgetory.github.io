unboxed so crowdfunded tech products
have a long history of being complete
garbage usually shipping years after
their original launch dates with missing
features broken functionality and no
further support so when I heard that I
could review the crowdfunder TV which is
a lower cost better featured competitor
to the Microsoft Surface pro I was
expecting to find yet another piece of
junk that failed to live up to the hype
but I was completely and utterly wrong
for my experience with the Eevee over
the past few weeks it's not just a great
competitor to the surface pro it's a
better option in several ways but before
I get into the nitty-gritty
let's talk basics you'll see the surface
pro reference tool order in this review
and that's for a key reason the Eevee is
very similar from a hardware and design
perspective it's a twelve point three
inch Windows 10 tablet with the magnetic
detachable keyboard cover and a
kickstand it's designed for people that
want to work on the go and want to
combine the flexibility of a tablet form
factor you know with the convenience of
typing on a physical keyboard the main
selling point here is that if you were
thinking of getting a surface pro you
might want to consider the Eevee instead
similar form factor similar hardware but
at a lower price and with more features
as I'm sure you can appreciate
that's an enticing proposition for those
interested in the surface pro like with
the surface pro there are a range of
hardware configurations they come with
different processes memory and storage
capacity
the base model which retails for 800 US
dollars packs an Intel Core M 37 by 38
gig of ram and 128 gig of SSD space but
you can configure the Eevee up to a core
i7 7 Y 75 16 gig of ram and a one
terabyte SSD for two thousand US dollars
and my review model was one step down
from the top with a 512 gig SSD instead
of that one terabyte one and it comes
with a retail price of sixteen hundred
US dollars the Eevee is cheaper across
the board for a comparable hardware
configuration relative to the surface
pro this is partly due to one simple
factor every Eevee comes with the
detachable keyboard and active stars
included in the box while with the
surface pro these essential accessories
are expensive extras if you need a quick
comparison the Eevee with a core i5 CPU
eight gigabytes of RAM and 256 gig SSD
costs $1,200 with the keyboard and
stylus included and if you're after a
comparable 2017 surface pro you're
looking at a $1300 plus 130 for the
tight cover and a hundred bucks for the
pen
so the Eevee it's three hundred and
thirty dollars cheaper and the
difference only gets larger at
higher-end configurations and I've
talked about pricing let's discuss the
actual design of this tablet one of the
surface pros best features is its
beautiful magnesium body the Eevee gets
a lot of things right with its own
version a solid well-built metal unibody
to the point where most of the
complaints and nitpicks rather than deal
breaking floors the chassis looks great
it's extremely solid with no obvious
seams of manufacturing defects and it
feels wonderful to hold next to the
matter metal finish best of all the
design doesn't feel like a Genki
crowdfunded piece of garbage had a major
player like Dell or Lenovo released this
exact same design it too would receive
praise for its premium construction and
a feeling well with their top-tier
products the Eevee wouldn't be a surface
Pro competitor without a kickstand so
it's no surprise to see a near identical
kickstand implemented here the EBS
kickstand doesn't have the same range of
motion as the surface pro 135 versus 165
degrees but it comes close as a smooth
hinge allowing any angle to be set yet
the hinge is strong enough to maintain
this angle with that accidentally
sliding to a different angle it's a
great kickstand it feels tough enough to
resist a beating over the lifetime of
the tablet as for features the Eevee
raises the bar significantly compared to
the limited in comparison surface pro
every aspect of the surface pro is
included there's a full-size USB 3.0
port micro SD card slot headphone jack
keyboard connector and cameras on both
sides
there's also top firing speakers which
are terrible but you know they're there
on top of this though the Eevee has
everything you wanted the surface pro to
include but didn't
with there's an additional USB 3.0 type
a port for two in total which is
extremely handy for attaching multiple
accessories but it gets better because
the Eevee has both a USB 3.1 type C port
and a Thunderbolt 3 port Microsoft has
resisted adding Thunderbolt to the
surface pro for some reason but you get
here with full compatibility for
DisplayPort and external GPUs
consequently there's no mini DisplayPort
but Thunderbolt 3 is a far more useful
and allows similar display out
connectivity through dongles anyway so
the e V includes double the USB a ports
as two other USB C port and the widely
requested Thunderbolt it basically has
the i/o of a modern laptop but in a
tablet form factor for charging there's
no magnetic wall charger instead the e V
uses the universal standard USB C
charging through either of the ports I
certainly prefer the ability to use
other charges to power this device
though you know that magnetic charge on
the surface pro it's pretty handy the e
V also supports Windows hello though
it's through a fingerprint reader
integrated into the power button rather
than through facial recognition the
buttons on this tablet are very shallow
and hard to press though particularly
the volume buttons not so much of a
concern with the power button as you
only need to tap it to unlock the device
and activate the fingerprint lock but
the volume buttons they're not
particularly great one of the best
aspects of a V though is the included
keyboard cover and active pen both of
which are optional accessories for the
surface pro these accessories are
basically essential to complete the
overall package without them you have
just a basic tablet but with them you
have a multi mode device so from
Microsoft to charge an additional 230
bucks for the combination seems a bit
egregious the keyboard cover it's
absolutely outstanding it's so much
better than the surface pro type cover
even the premium signature type cover
there it's ridiculous Microsoft charges
a hundred and thirty to a hundred and
sixty dollars for that accessory alone
not only does the Eevee's keyboard cover
provide a superior typing experience
thanks to very clicky keys it also
includes additional features like
support for wireless use via Bluetooth
and seven color LED backlighting plus
the entire thing is covered with premium
Alcantara fabric just like the most
expensive type
other Microsoft sells the track pad has
a gorilla glass surface which again
feels excellent to use no complaints
about the trackpad whatsoever
and provides an awesome tracking
experience with the soil click and
enough usable space there's also been
included active pens not quite as good
as the surface pen with fewer pressure
levels and slightly longer latency but
it's still very usable for everyday
annotation drawing and highlighting work
though the EBS display it's a 12-point
328 80 by 1920 sharp eggs ooh LCD panel
so the same size and 3:2 aspect ratio as
a surface Pro's display with a slightly
higher resolution and pixel density
sharps EXO display technology it's very
good so the display has some great
inherent qualities viewing angles are
excellent as is its peak brightness
which is 400 nits well above a lot of
other Windows systems you claims a
contrast ratio of 1500 to 1 I achieved
1260 to 1 but that's still a fantastic
result there is some backlight bleed
particularly along the bottom edge which
is noticeable when viewing dark images
in dark environments as a result
uniformity isn't perfect
that said the top 2/3 are pretty good
from a uniformity standpoint and for
creators the demand color accuracy every
AV unit is individually factory
calibrated to the srgb spectrum with the
d65 or 6,500 K white point target and
Delta II mm values less than 1.0 the XO
displays easily capable of hitting full
srgb coverage achieve 99.9 percent in my
testing so images appear vibrant and
generally outstanding here unfortunately
my review nerd actually shipped with an
incorrect calibration due to an error in
the calibration process did result in a
bit of a red tint actual shipping units
though destined for you guys backers
retail you know crowdfunded all that
stuff won't have the issue because after
I point out to Eevee they were nice
enough to go back and retest every
single unit so let's talk about
performance which is probably the
weakest area of the AV while the surface
pro uses a fully fledged 15 watt Intel
KB like u series processes at least in
their mid and upper tier models the
Eevee sticks with 4.5 watt Y series
cable 8 CPUs these Y series parts are
clocked lower on the same 2 cores and
fourth
and the intel HD graphics well they
aren't as fast I'm gonna put up some
benchmarks who I discuss how the Eevee
performs in general you know rather than
looking at individual results so when
the core i7 7y it's 75 in my Eevee
reviewnit is tasked with relatively
short workloads talking about you know
under 20 seconds for example the
performance difference between it and
something like the core i7 7,500 you
it's relatively small in the range of
20% or less this is seen in workloads
like Excel Monte Carlo winrar
compression and MATLAB a CPU like the i7
is 7660 you which is found in the latest
surface pro high-end very variance does
clock higher so these margins will
extend somewhat but it does give a rough
idea of where the seven were 75 sits
among other offerings the key thing to
take away from these benchmarks is that
light or short workloads for most tasks
performed on a mobile device like this
you know opening apps loading webpages
editing documents and spreadsheets like
photo editing and all those sort of
things hit the CPU for a short period of
time and he that the KB like YC
recipient Eve V doesn't fall too far
behind it's you serious counterparts and
the you Series models are always faster
in these tasks but it's not buy enough
to cause a painful experience for those
using y series it's in longer more
intensive workloads of the 7 y 75 really
suffers video rendering in handbrake for
example is 50% faster with the u series
7i 770 500 you and that margin does grow
with the i7 7660 you Cinebench another
rendering workload is a good 47% faster
than the 7500 you in the multi-threaded
workload these are prime examples where
the higher TDP allows the you series to
significantly outperform y series if
you're thinking of you know rendering a
video for example it could take half an
hour less on a new series mystery in for
something 60 minutes long GPU
performance is another area where the y
series skew suffers compared to its you
serious counterpart in 3dmark workloads
like cloud gate even just the HD 620
graphics pulls away by 30 to 40 percent
you know you've thrown iris plus
graphics and the 7y 75 adjust
keep up the easy and most other
low-power devices that aren't
well-suited to gaming but even in like
graphics workloads or games what you're
going to see is better performance um
you seriously appears no matter what the
evening can be connected to EGP use
through Thunderbolt 3 though this isn't
ideal all the time for portable use the
Eevee at least the model I received a
review with 512 gigabytes of storage
uses an intel SSD 600 P which is an
entry-level PCIe nvme SSD the surface
pro uses a samsung PM 9 71 and it's
pretty similar in terms of its
performance search performance is good
often matching a number of top and Ultra
portables or even outperforming them in
tasks such as sequential reads the 600 P
isn't as strong when it comes to write
performance though it su provides enough
speed to our fast uploading and basic IO
tasks the Eevee's battery life as well
it's pretty good which basically
validates their choice to use a Y Series
CPU in conjunction with the 48 watt our
internal battery in tasks like PC mark
home the Eevee outperforms the HP
spectre x360 which uses a larger 58 watt
hour battery so 21 percent larger and it
has an 8 percent larger display as well
so that's a really great result and it
falls well within the range of devices
we've tested with great battery life so
I think people will be really pleased
with these results all up the EP is a
lesson to all crowdfunded hardware
startups are not just how to approach
things correctly but also how to take on
an incumbent giant and produce a better
product simply put the Eevee is better
than the surface pro in many ways and
that's quite remarkable the Eevee has a
great design and packaging loads more
features in the surface pro most
importantly a lot more IO I also love
that the keyboard and pen are included
in the price unlike with the surface pro
and the factory calibrated display is
pretty impressive as well for those that
require color accurate displays the only
main downside is the performance with
the u series CPUs in the surface pro
outperforming the y series parts in the
Eevee for lighter tasks like web
browsing
spreadsheet work and some light photo
editing the difference isn't that large
and the Eevee definitely isn't slow by
any means but if you know a video editor
or need to run long simulations you
might want to stick to the
upper-end surface pro models the key
thing for me though is the price the
Eevee is 300 to 900 US dollars cheaper
than equivalent surface pro models with
the keyboard and pen price factored in
that's a pretty big difference it makes
it hard to recommend the surface pro
there are some questions on things like
AV availability support warranty and so
forth because you know this is a new
startup first-generation hardware but
with such a huge price difference it's
definitely worth looking into the e V if
you're after something along the lines
of a surface pro anyway that's it for
this look at the surprisingly good AV
