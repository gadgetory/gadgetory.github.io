my PC please if you missed any of the
previous episodes of the video
explaining what this series is all about
then be sure to check those out I'll
link them in the video description on
last week's episode we checked out five
AMD FX 6300 pcs and they're all in need
of various upgrades you the viewers
voted Gabriel's Death Star the most
worthy of receiving the proposed
upgrades therefore we have our first
us-based winner and coming Gabriel's way
is a brand new rising 5 14-hundred cpu
or gigabyte be 350 motherboard 8
gigabytes of ddr4 memory and a geforce
gtx 1050 - our graphics card and once
again the good news for the runners-up
is that they will be receiving a Rainbow
six siege game code from Ubisoft big
thanks to Ubisoft for supporting the
series and providing our contestants
with free games once all the new
hardware is installed Gabriel to send us
over some updated photos of his
refurbished rig and then we'll show them
off to you guys at the start of season 2
and a special feature also do not forget
to vote each week as that will place you
in the running to win some very cool
prizes and they are global giveaways
last week JK Willy won horizon 5 1500 X
processor this week we have another cool
prize and I'll announce that later in
the video
anyway we have 5 new PCs to check out so
let's get into it
nimma built Darwin back in 2012 and
since then the build has continued to
evolve hence the name the apu was picked
for the reason anyone picks an APU it
was cheap and it packed a decent GPU
before too long though the integrated
graphics was replaced with a free Radeon
HD seventy seven hundred and that was
picked up from a friend but has recently
been swapped out for an RX 480 so in
terms of GPU performance the system is
actually quite good the issue here of
course is that Trinity based a 1050 800
K apu even overclocked it's just not
getting the job done it's causing
massive system bottlenecks other
upgrades over the years have included
the NZXT h 440 case the corsair TX 750
pound the Samsung 850 120 gigabyte SSD
the games of choice right now include
overwatch payday 2 and Guild Wars 2 I'm
most familiar with overwatch and I know
for a fact that the apu will be heavily
limiting performance of the rx for
aiding in that title at this point NEMA
has come to the absolute end of the road
with the FM 2 plus platform and is
currently saving for a CPU motherboard
and memory upgrade he's a big fan of AMD
and has been dreaming of a horizon 5
upgrade for many months now so I propose
the following let's ditch the APU for a
shiny new horizon 5 1600 which will
throw in the asrock a be 350 gaming K
fourth a gigabytes of memory the memory
capacity can be later increases there
will still be to freedom slots available
then with the leftover money let's go
for a four terabyte hard drive to boost
the system's storage capabilities now
there's no need to juggle installed
games and I hate having to do that next
up we have a rather bland looking system
from Vince this looks very much like
something you would find in an office
type setting and frankly that's probably
where it belongs
sadly Vince is trying a game on this
thing and he says he's having a very
little fun doing so right now he's
playing cs:go using low quality settings
at low frame rates and it's much the
same with other games he likes to play
such as rust and Far Cry 3 like the
a1050 100k that we looked at previously
the a10 7700 K only has a 384 stream
processor enabled radeon GPU so it's
extremely weak by today's standards as
usual we do only have a $500 u.s. budget
so I'm gonna have to stretch it pretty
big for this one when on a budget go
rise and throw I always say and that's
been a saying for like two months now
anyway the r3 1200 on the asrock a B 350
and with a gigabytes of ddr4 will work a
treat they're napping Vince's game will
be the geforce gtx 1063 gigabyte and
that will be perfect for his low res
monitor then making sure the upgrade
doesn't go up in smoke
I recommend the EVGA 500 b1 it's a 500
watt bronze certified power supply and
that will see us hit the $500 us budget
right on the nose
okay so Liam has an insanely detailed
and somewhat painful upgrade history so
get ready here we go
in 2012 the system started with an FX
4100 and that was later upgraded to the
FX 83 20 but that cpu died just two
months ago replacing the dead FX cpu was
the Athlon x3 4 50 ouch
turns out the FX 8320 all the previous
power supply melted the 4-pin power
input on the motherboard so both the
motherboard and PS you were junked so
having scrapped the FX build liam went
and picked up a secondhand eye 860 600k
on an MSI motherboard from ebay he also
got the cheap PSU but that died pretty
soon after the purchase so he replaced
that with an EVGA 500 watt Liam says
he's finally learned his lesson on GPS
use so good stuff shockingly after
submitting his PC though the a8 6600 K
died and he's now replaced that with an
a8 7600 the latest update is the
system's working at least for now
I have no idea how one man kills so much
AMD hardware but Liam has had a
seriously bad run I'm not even sure I
want to recommend anything AMD at the
moment but with the Intel 8th gen stuff
not arrive until later this week what
I'm going to do so again let's up for
the risin 5 6100 but this time I'm just
I'm not messing around for the
motherboard let's just go straight in
for the kill with the gigabyte a X 370
gaming k3 and stick 8 gigabytes of
memory on that at least if Liam does win
the upgrade package he's got himself a
motherboard with a nice long three-year
warranty with that question Andrew
should be on the next season of
scrapyard Wars because by the sounds of
it he's been training all his life prior
to 2012 he'd never owned a PC that
wasn't a salvage job but in 2013 he
bought a hey CH peeper William P 6 for
$500 gutted it and over the years he's
bought a number of second-hand parts to
turn into what you see here so basically
a new computer gaming wise Andrew mostly
plays doom Skyrim and
alien isolation none of which are
terribly demanding though that's
probably because that's real
or we can get away with for now apart
from the APU the rest of the system's
actually rather respectable the geforce
gtx 750ti is fine for 1080p gaming the
WD blue SSD is nice and snappy and the
corsair carbides a really nice case and
i love the front air vent mod Andrews
done the deep core game ax 400 is a good
value air cooler and the EVGA 600 BQ is
a quality budget power supply so once
again what we need here is a platform
upgrade therefore I propose the core i5
7600 K on a z2 70 motherboard what do
you guys think about that you know
someone's already raced to the comment
section in protest no seriously this is
yet another Rison job yes everybody gets
Verizon that said I just realized this
is our first-ever Canadian contestant so
what can we do with the Canadian dollar
we've about 620 of them to play with
using every last dollar I proposed the
arisin 5 1600 a gigabyte a B 350 M
gaming three motherboard and 16
gigabytes of ddr4 3,200 memory that's
really gonna bring you up to speed and
if you upgrades the GPU at a later point
then you really can go from mid range
type gaming right up to the high end
with a single component upgrade last on
the upgrade menu we have civil Ironhide
revised throw a few numbers in there and
you could have yourself a new Logitech
keyboard instead this is the name of
Harris's much-loved gaming rig which he
bought back in 2014 the pcs initial
intention was to gain but Harris now
uses it quite a bit for his uni projects
since buying the pre-built system he's
added an intel SSD and this year his
mates gutting the corsair carbide spec 0
for for his birthday and that was to
replace the cheap Thermaltake case that
the system came in right now harris
mostly plays GTA 5 csgo and dota 2 and
they all play ok the problem is his CAD
work the AMD APU is woefully
underpowered and he says the system
constantly freezes when adding new
layers or rotating a design so that
being the case I propose we go with the
Rison five sixteen hundred throw that I
stand at 80 X as are up a be 350 a pro
for motherboard and that will fill out
the corsair carbide case a bit better
than what he currently has we could also
squeeze and a gigabyte kit into the
budget but the as rock board does have
an additional two DIMM slots free for
expansion in the future now with the
money left over let's get rid of that
cheap and nasty center comm master 800
watt power supply before the thing just
detonates para says the power button is
broken anyway the be quiet system power
eight 600 watt is an affordable and
higher quality option so let's drop that
in there now in the future of harris
upgrades the graphics card he'll ever pc
that won't just breeze through is cad
work but it'll also be a very capable
gamer all right guys there's five
stuttery AMD APU systems a whole in need
of various upgrades it's now your job to
let us know which one you think is most
deserving of receiving the proposed
upgrade package to cast your vote please
follow the link in the video description
below
that'll head you over to the tech spot
forums by signing up for the forum's
commenting and voting you'll also go on
there running to win some cool prizes
and they are global giveaways for the
viewers speaking of which the winner
from last week's episode is Thiago Perez
congratulations mate you have an awesome
Reisman v 1600 processor from AMD coming
your way big thank you to AMD for
providing that amazing prize and
remember guys vote each week comment
because we have more amazing prizes to
give away
finally voting will be open til Friday
night in the US and that is Saturday
afternoon here in Australia and then
we'll announce the winner of this
episode at the start of next week's
episode and at that point we'll have
five new PCs to check out and we'll do
it all over again I think we'll probably
check out some Core 2 quad systems next
week so that should be pretty cool I'm
