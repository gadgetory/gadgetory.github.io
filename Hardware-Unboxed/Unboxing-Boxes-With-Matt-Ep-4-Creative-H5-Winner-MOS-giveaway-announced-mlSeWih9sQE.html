of unboxing boxes with Matt giant
scissors edition so today as you can see
not a whole lot to unbox but I do have
some giveaway announcements to make
including the winner of the creative h5
headset so stick around for that let's
get stuck into the first package council
my cutting technique with the scissors
not even cutting towards myself this
thing is the old rail 89 + and as you
can see it's a gaming pad but it's got
some pretty cool features I think it's
actually as mechanical switches which is
a nice touch RGB lights you can program
the keys I believe it's specifically
designed for League Legends players but
obviously you play whatever with it so
it looks pretty cool are we interested
to check that out and never really use
something like this before next up got a
pretty beaten up box from China and
spoiler alert it is a keyboard so let's
pop open to see what's inside no I've
done well I've been receiving a lot of
keyboards lately so I don't want to feel
your inboxes with just keyboard review
so try and spread them out I can this
one I believes from the sort
do I have a move down before
so it looks like the internal box to
survive pretty well the tesoro gram
spectrum so another mechanical keyboard
it's got cutting-edge low-profile keys
so something different to be interesting
to check these out optimized keystroke
fast response and accurate actuation
we're all kind of switches it uses blue
mechanical switches but not cherries
anyway look out for the review will be
coming up alright last package and I
wonder what we have here could be
another one another one so this one's
from coolermaster and obviously a
keyboard but I believe yeah it does it
has exclusive mem chemical switches so
some sort of combination between
mechanical and membrane switches so I'll
be very interested to check that out
it's compatible with cherry key caps so
I'm sure if there's a mouse in there as
well it's open enough and find out I'm
sure the mouse and we fit in here but
interesting that it's on the cover
alright so there is a mouse in there so
for a full keyboard and mouse package
will be interesting to see what the
price comes in at interesting the keys
they're kind of mushy but they
definitely don't feel like standing
membrane so interesting too yeah plug
that in and give it a proper go so
that's all we've got for today in terms
of unboxing all right now before I
announce the winner of the creative h5
had said I've got another cool giveaway
announcement to make Moss the company
that hooked me up with the awesome moss
pack backpack for the Thailand trip was
also given me some cool stuff to give
away to you guys firstly I've got two of
these moss spring lightning cables to
send anywhere in the world these are
simply really high quality charge and
sync cables the iphone or ipad the heads
are made from aluminium and there's a
steel spring at the end to prevent any
damage to the cable they're also wrapped
in a braid of fabric the most calls a
rugged exoskeleton cable jacket the best
part of these cables is
Moss is so confident in this being the
last lightning cable you'll ever need to
buy that they're offering a lifetime
warranty on every cable their cell now
the other gadget I've got from my Steve
away is the world's first full speed USB
see power bank this thing boasts 12,000
milliamp hours and claims to be able to
charge a macbook 2015 up to seventy-five
percent capacity pretty impressive stuff
it can also charge most smartphones four
times and most tablets twice so if you
keen to win these cool Moss products
tagged me in a photo on Instagram or
Facebook showing me why you want to win
and which product you're after I'll pick
and announce the winners sometime in
September now let's sort out the winner
of this creative h5 headset thanks to
everyone that entered I love seeing all
of your posts in the forum it seemed
like there was quite a few of you that
could have seriously done with an
upgrade but they could only be one
winner and this time around it's a user
called its gel vynn their post really
made me laugh to be honest and i love
the ingenuity and MacGyver style use of
a q-tip to secure their mark to their
old headset well you can relegate the QT
