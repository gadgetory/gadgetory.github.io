we got our first look at the battlefield
5 open beta or beta as my American
viewers like to say yes the British
pronunciation is usually better well the
American pronunciation is beta and as
far as I know all Aussie say beta but
Steve I'm an Aussie and I say beta don't
lie to me
anyway what's this vo about again is the
battlefield 5 open beta
I mean beta cherish ok so last week I
benchmarked almost a dozen AMD and
NVIDIA GPUs at 1080p 1440p and 4k to see
how they compared in battlefield 5 and
at the time I'd completely lost my voice
or I just recovered from completely I
was on my way to recovering from
completely losing my voice as you can
probably tell I still haven't fully
recovered I've been to the doctors it's
possibly going to be about a week with
this sort of croak ish kind of voice so
sorry about that but I'm not gonna stop
making videos because we have plenty of
cool content to get through so I'm just
gonna have to suck it up and you're
gonna have to bear with me anyway all
testing in the previous video where we
compared the GPUs was done our standard
GPU test rig which comprises of a core
i7 87 okay clocked at 5 gigahertz and I
noticed really really high CPU
utilization and I concluded at the time
that if we're seeing in 87 ok hitting up
to around 80% and usually hovering
around 70% but running a quad core was
likely going to go quite badly you'd see
a lot of stuttering and just be a bad
experience of course I would have to
investigate that further at the time I
foolishly promised a very in-depth CPU
comparison once the games released in a
few months time but hint at the fact
that I might be able to do some CPU
testing on the beta version of the game
and yeah that prompted a huge amount of
you to say please do CPU testing as soon
as possible so with so many of you
demanding a CPU comparison right away as
soon as that GPU video went online I got
testing I did note in the previous video
that gathering accurate data with the
single-player portion of the game is
extremely difficult and it really is so
much so that when it came to the CPU
testing I had to take an average of 6
runs to try and smooth things out and
get somewhat accurate information the
runs were also extended so they're
longer runs and as a result it took me
three full days of nothing but testing
to get just 10 CPUs done at two
resolutions nope sorry one resolution
using two GPUs so not the amount of data
you would usually expect to see from us
but the test conditions are very
difficult and it's hard to get a lot of
data because of it I'm also testing a
different section of the map that's
closer to where the action takes place
does that seem to place a bit more load
on the CPU
however most of the time was wasted
trying to get into the right game and
then be out a benchmark at the right
place so yeah a lot of time was wasted
just trying to get to the benchmark
location and then execute the pass
honestly while I was really intrigued to
see the data I have to admit I didn't
enjoy the process at all
a rare benchmark session that I mostly
didn't enjoy anyway the data is in and
it's certainly interesting so far I've
only seen one other source provides CPU
benchmark results and they came from
game GPU and my numbers don't exactly
aligned with theirs
there is some crossover but for the most
part the performance trends are a bit
different and again this can be juda
multiplayer being very difficult to
benchmark accurately and the performance
can vary massively depending on what map
you are benchmarking where in the map
you're benchmarking what the play is and
the game are doing there's a lot of
variables at play here
so again just testing multiplayer is
extremely difficult I don't mean that
it's just hard work and I prefer to take
the easy way out
I mean it's nearly impossible to gather
accurate data at least for comparison
with other components the fluctuation
between runs can be bloody massive
whereas our battlefield one single
player benchmark often delivers the same
average framerate over and over again
and the same is also true for the one
percent low result you don't see that
when testing with multiplayer
when testing the single-player portion
of battlefield 1 it's rare that we see a
deviation of more than five frames per
second with the battlefield 5
multiplayer though I was often seeing up
to a 20 FPS difference for the average
framerate I did neglect the extreme
outliers and I tested many more times
than I normally would to try and report
the most accurate performance I could
because of this just watching it
side-by-side gameplay footage of two
different hardware configurations
executing a similar pass in my opinion
is next to useless if you've got 30
players relatively close to you the
frame rates seem to be much lower
especially if they're blowing things up
and engaging in extreme combat however
if the actions taking place much further
away from you it seems to be a lot less
demanding on the system also making sure
the same sort of stuff is going on
around the player character for each
pass is a serious challenge and it's
basically an impossible challenge which
is what I said earlier sorry by now
you've probably gathered I'm not a big
fan of these multiplayer benchmarks at
least not for comparing different
hardware configurations that said this
is the absolute best we can do for now
and while I believe the data is
reasonably accurate given the conditions
and the effort I've put into making them
as accurate as possible
I'd still only recommend you take them
as a rough guide so having said all that
let's have a look at what I have ok so
these results were all recorded at 1080p
using the ultra quality settings with
the GTX 10 atti as you can see the core
i7 87 okay provides the best results
allowing the 1080i to pump out 158 FPS
on average with a 1% lower result of 118
fps the core i5 8600 k was equally
impressive and Intel's last quad core
Core i7 the 77 RK also crushed it then
from the 77 ok we see an 18 percent drop
in performance to the 2700 acts which
honestly is significantly more than I
was expecting to see then we say that
these second gen Rison processors were
only able to edge out the core i5 7600 K
as the Intel seventh gen quad core
provided first generation rise in
performance
also please note I'm not using tuned sub
timings for the
Rison CPUs the second-gen parts are
using ddr4 3000 with XMP loaded the same
is true for all the Intel CPUs as well
so some pretty disappointing results
here for AMD given Rison is quite
competitive in battlefield 1 we often
find that poor rise and performance can
be a result of the Nvidia display driver
sorry ran all the tests using vega 64
liquid for the most part we are now GPU
limited so it's difficult to determine
just how much in a video are to blame
for aizen's weaker than expected
performance with the GTX 280 ti the
Rison processors did offer slightly
better performance with vega 64 but with
frame rates limited to around 120 FPS on
average as I said we are GPU bound and
this makes it difficult to determine if
horizon is better off with the radeon
GPU if the game had been a bit easier to
test and didn't involve hours of wasted
time trying to get into games i would
have started over and tested again using
the high or possibly even the medium
quality settings at least for stuff like
shadows for example what I did do before
wrapping things up was retest with the
GTX 1080i on the Rotterdam map and I did
this before realizing that it would have
been useful to perhaps test for Vegas 64
with some less demanding graphical
settings
anyway this benchmark pass is a complete
lap of the train carriages which takes
roughly 80 seconds to complete this
benchmark was slightly more demanding
than that of the narvik test but as you
can see the margins are much the same
Intel's 8 thread CPUs deliver
class-leading performance while Verizon
trailed by a much greater than expected
margin it was disappointing a/c Rison
only matching the quad core Core i5 7600
K in our battlefield 5 CPU tests again I
realized that there is at least one
other set of results out there that
contradicts these findings but I spent a
lot of time gathering this data and saw
no evidence that the horizon processors
could hang with the likes of the 77 ok
8600 K and 8700 K also to make sure
nothing had gone wrong with the horizon
test system I did jump back into
battlefield 1 and confirmed the solid
performance in that title that we had
seen previously I was shocked to find
very little stuttering with the quad
core processors the quad cores that
don't support
Smt that is the 7,600 cane 8350 kay
did it time suffer a small amount of
stuttering but it was very minimal and
certainly didn't take away from the
gameplay oddly both the risin 5 and
risin 7 processors also suffered a small
amount of stuttering about the same as
the 4 threaded intel parts the
higher-end intel parts did provide
perfectly smooth performance the semi
similar okay for example was buttery
smooth I should note that even with Vega
64 there was still a small amount of
stuttering with Rison
so battlefield 5 clearly needs to be
better optimized for Rison and that's
quite surprising given how well the
battlefield 1 was optimized for the rise
in architecture and both games do use
the same frostbite 3 engine that said
though they did still manage to go
backwards on the whole dx12 thing so why
not do the same with processor support
anyway the game is still only in the
beta phase must be fully assimilated now
so hopefully the developer can polish it
a little bit more before their release
in November personally I'm not expecting
any real big improvement but I am
hopeful that before too long they will
address these performance issues finally
I would like to just thank patreon
member element 83 for generously lending
his origin account to help with the
testing for those of you unaware origin
does this really awesome thing where it
locks you out after five Hardware
changes and the lockout last 24 hours
this makes benchmarking a number of
hardware configurations extremely
difficult I am in talks with EA right
now to see if there's anything we can do
about my account for testing in the
future for now the workaround is to use
multiple accounts and I had four to work
with for this video so again a big thank
you to element 83 for helping out there
can't be easy sacrificing your account
when you're very keen to place in
battlefield 5 oh and I should note that
he's also using the horizon 720 700 X
with 32 gigabytes of ddr4 3000 memory
with Titan sub timings and he's also
reporting a bit of random stuttering
here and there with the horizon
processor again only a very small amount
of stuttering like what I saw but it's
good to know that I wasn't the only one
seeing this and that is going to do it
for this
again sorry about my voice and I realize
there is only a very limited amount of
testing in this video compared to what
we normally do but remember it is just
the beta version of the game and when
it's officially released hopefully we
better provide a lot more GPU and CPU
benchmarks also coming up on the channel
soon I will a couple of you notice that
this build has been progressing along
nicely I'll have a video later this week
showing you where I'm at with this it's
coming along very nicely I also have an
episode of unboxing boxes coming up for
all of you that have been asking you in
the next episode of that is and I have a
mountain of gear to go through a lot of
it we will be reviewing and testing on
the channel over the coming weeks so
it'll be good to get awesome and early
look at those products anyway if you
