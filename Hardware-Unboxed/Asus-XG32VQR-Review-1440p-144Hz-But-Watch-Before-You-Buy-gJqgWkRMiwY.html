another monitor review today's focus is
on the brand-new asus rog Strix XG 32
vqr this gaming monitor has just
launched onto the market after being
announced at the end of last year it's
currently available in Australia and I
suspect it will hit other countries in
the next few weeks the XG 32 bqr is the
successor to the well-received XG 32 BQ
with the are essentially standing for
HDR this new variant keeps most of the
original specs including its 32 inch
1440p 144 hertz VA panel 1800 hour
curvature and freesync support but then
adds in HDR functionality with display
HDR 400 certification 94% DCI p3
coverage and free sync - as a result
it's around 140 ozzie dollars more
expensive if you've been watching some
of my monitor of using the past you
probably already know my thoughts on
display HDR 400 certification and how I
think it's kind of useless but I'll talk
more about how this monitor performs in
HDR content a bit later in the review
before that let's take a closer look at
the design for those that have a new
suit ROG monitor or have seen them
before the XG 32 vqr will be familiar in
fact it's basically the same as other
modern ROG displays in every way we're
talking heavy gamer style with a weird
pattern on the rear a ring of RGB LED
lighting around the stand connection
logo projection at the base of the stand
red highlights you know all the usual
stuff personally I don't like this sort
of design I prefer more understated look
but if you like the whole game aesthetic
then this thing will be right up your
alley the good news is that despite the
gamer design the Zeus does pack in a
number of good features the stand is
puli height adjustable and can both tilt
and swivel the build quality is good
using metal for the stand legs and
plastic for the rest of the display data
and recovery is standard for this sort
of panel again whether you like it will
be a personal preference thing the on
screen display not going to rehash a lot
of what is found here given once again
it's the same as other asus rog monitors
i like that it can be controlled through
a directional toggle and there's a few
quick access buttons for features you
get a standard range of functionality
like reading modes shadow boosting
crosshairs FPS counters and so on a soos
has a good suite of features here mostly
designed towards gaming although a few
other OEMs are catching up these days
ports as well standard stuff two HDMI
2.0 ports DisplayPort a few USB ports
and 3.5 no audio jack the cable
management hole in the stand is handy as
well to keep everything looking neat
prior let's talk performance and here is
where things don't look as great for the
x3 32 vqr the first thing I noticed was
something wrong with either the coating
or the sub pixel structure I can't quite
tell either way there is some issue here
causing what appears to be horizontal
lines through solid coats particularly
Gray's it's not a color banding issue or
lines like you might get with a broken
GPU it's just a subtle horizontal
pattern it's also very difficult to
capture on camera so I don't have a
great visual for you here unfortunately
it's not a gamebreaking issue and it's
very hard to notice in moving content
like games or videos but if you're
reading web pages or editing documents
which often have large blocks of solid
colors something just doesn't look quite
right I've reviewed a few other 32-inch
1440p 144 Hertz curved vias and they
haven't presented this problem so it was
surprising to see this crop up normally
these types of issues only appear with
basic entry-level displays as for
response times we're seeing all the
usual issues with high refresh ba panels
despite boosting a 144 Hertz refresh
rate the average grata gray response
time I recorded was seven point two nine
milliseconds which is actually a little
better than average for a VA however
refreshing at 144 Hertz means are a
fresh window of six point nine four
milliseconds so with the XG 32 V QR and
it's seven point two nine millisecond
response time were only able to update
the image on the screen inside that
window around half the time in other
words the response times are
bottlenecking the display from achieving
a true 144 Hertz refresh rate this
result isn't awful for this sort of
display the extra 32 V QR is still
easily able to produce a 120 Hertz
refresh rate which not all high refresh
vias can do super reality is that VA
technology isn't particularly fast and
often fails to reach the levels required
for true 144 Hertz so that you need to
be looking at IPS or
and displays instead not a deal-breaker
for most people aside from the usual
amounts of ghosting and blur you get
from VA displays input lag though is
excellent at under two milliseconds so
the overall latency for this monitor is
very good not quite a TN level but
suitable for most gamers brightness is
strong for this monitor with its
supposedly HDR capable backlight hitting
over 500 nits out of the box which puts
it ahead of most VA monitors contrast
ratio is also decent at 2700 to 1 not
quite at the top end of what I've seen
from V ace but good enough and certainly
well above other monitor technologies
color performance out of the box is
typical of a gaming class display with
not much attention paid to accuracy
grayscale performance is impacted by an
incorrect white point which gives the
display a slight green tint it's unusual
to see a green tint but that's where I
saw out of the box color performance is
impacted by the monitor sporting a wide
gamut which leads to over saturation and
inaccuracies when viewing srgb content
which is the majority of what you'll be
viewing most of my thoughts on Kyle
performers here could be taken from any
other wide gamut gaming monitor review
the srgb mode here is not good at all
and there's no other way to clamp the
display to an sRGB gamut so you stuck
with over saturation unless you use a
calibrated profile and by using color
managed apps a simple srgb gama toggle
would be great for everyday use you can
correct the white point using the
onscreen control so it's fairly easy to
fix the green tint measuring against
srgb I was able to get an excellent 1.05
Delta II average in our gross scale
tests but again the gamut was left on
clamps so we're still looking at color
Delta is north of 2.0 however we are
only slightly above 2.0 which is better
than usual performance I feel an sRGB
clamp would give me accuracy here
luckily for those interested in the wide
gamut performance after fixing the white
point I achieved Sub 2.0 Delta averages
in our saturation and color checker
tests as well as 90% DCI p3 coverage I
didn't quite hit the 94 percent that I
Suz claims nor did I achieve the same
coverage as IPS displays but overall I'd
say the DCI p3 performance out of the
box with only some slight tweaks is very
good you can achieve great performance
with a software profile generator
through a full calibration no sir
they're the downsides being not all apps
recognize or support software ICC
profiles which is why I advocate for
sRGB clamp modes and the contrast ratio
does drop a fair bit to just 2300 to one
better than other display types but not
the three thousand to one you usually
get from a VA unfortunately uniformity
is poor the bottom right corner of my
review sample was noticeably darker than
the top left which you can see here in
these uniformity Delta is of above 4.0
in that area code vias tend to be the
least uniform of any monitor technology
and that's the case here with the extra
32 vqr I was hoping for a better result
but I left a bit disappointed even more
disappointing is the fattest monitor is
advertised as HDR capable the best I can
say this monitors HDR performance is
that it supports HDR input so
technically it can show HDR content
however you aren't getting a true HD
experience because like a lot of display
HDR 400 certified displays the XG 32 vqr
only delivers in one of the 3k HDR
metrics the one area it does deliver in
is color gamut no surprises here this is
a wide gamut display so we are getting a
wide of an SDR color experience however
peak brightness of only 500 nits which
drops to the mid 400s when calibrated is
below the 600 nits peak that I
personally recommend and of course below
the 1000 it's that most hgr content is
mastered for but the biggest issue is
the lack of local dimming this means the
monitor really isn't capable of
delivering the high dynamic range the
term HD is referring to that's because
without local dimming the monitor can't
show both dark details and bright
highlights on the screen at the same
time which is essential for viewing HDR
content in essence without local dimming
the contrast ratio remains stuck at
around 2500 to one which is far lower
than the recommended 20,000 to one or
more for HDR when you add all this up
the HDR experience isn't very HDR
playing games in the HDR mode ends up
looking quite close to just running an
SDR monitor at a high brightness level
with a bit of extra saturation thrown in
I really don't think you were getting
much at all from playing games with HDR
enabled on this monitor which makes the
mode a bit of a bust and that's
the crux of the issue with the asou sex
g32 vqr this is a monitor that has been
released because it supports HDR it's
the key feature the key selling point
that's tempting you into spending more
money than the older non HDR model but
it doesn't deliver when it comes to HDR
performance which makes it impossible to
recommend over other cheaper SDR gaming
monitors I'm not a hundred percent sure
what the price difference between this
and the XG 32 V Q will end up as in the
United States but in Australia it's a
hundred and forty dollars or so if the
HDR experience was good then yeah I
guess you could justify that price
increase quite easily but given the HDR
and SDR mode a very similar there's no
way I'd be paying over $100 on the newer
model it's essentially just wasting your
cash on top of that the XG 32 vqr
doesn't even deliver the best SDR
performance in its class the weird
horizontal line issue with the coding
unclamped wide gamut and poor uniformity
are all issues that work against this
monitor it's disappointing given I've
been largely impressed with the sources
are the monitors especially in there roj
line and while I wouldn't recommend the
extra 32 vqr
I'd find it hard to recommend the non
HDR model the XG 32 VQ as well it's
currently on sale for six hundred and
sixty-five dollars in the US and seven
hundred and sixty dollars in Australia
which is far too expensive for this sort
of display in 2019 North Americans can
buy the vo-tech G + 32 DB which is
almost the same honor in terms of its
performance for just three hundred and
fifty dollars
it lacks a few extra features like a
height adjustable stand and some on
screen options but considering its $300
cheaper which is nearly half the price
it is a much better option
Aziz have monitors like the aoc AG 322
QC for for around $600 which again is a
very similar display and even supports
HDR and freesync - i'll be it with the
same HDR performance issues as this a
sous display so yeah not the best
monitor from a sous and one I can't see
myself recommending this fake HDR stuff
really is a concern for the market right
now I hope not too many people have been
duped into buying a display HDR 400
monitor thinking they're getting
something good but I certainly can see
how this would happen so just be warned
about hgr because I feel a few companies
are taking advantage
certain labels like display HDR to
create new products that really aren't
any better than what we've already got
that's it for this one subscribe for
more monitor coverage give this review I
like if you learn something consider
