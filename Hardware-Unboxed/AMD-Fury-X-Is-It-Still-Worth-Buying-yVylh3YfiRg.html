today's video we're winding the clock
all the way back to the early days of HP
m graphics cards that is to say 2015 and
on hands we have the Radeon r9 fury X
the very first graphics card to feature
high bandwidth memory it won't be long
now till if your ex has its second
birthday and although that makes it kind
of old recently it seems like many PC
gamers have been snapping up brand-new
versions from major online retailers
such as Amazon in fact as I was putting
this video together Amazon had a
brand-new XFX fury X that's almost as
many X's as Larry King has on sale for
just three hundred and eight dollars
with free shipping for us shoppers this
recent fury X fire sale had quite a few
of you wondering if you should purchase
the discounted Radeon graphics card or
pony up the extra cash for a geforce gtx
1070 for the most part the 1070 costs
around 390 dollars though gigabytes mini
ITX OC version can be found for as
little as three hundred and sixty
dollars u.s. as a side note unless you
find a good secondhand deal locally or
can order one at a good price from the
US the fury x looks to be a pretty bad
buy down under anyway I decided to throw
the fury X in our test machine and see
how it compares since I have just
recently updated my results in 16 new
games using recently released drivers it
was the perfect time to start comparing
the previous generation GPUs with that
let's get to the benchmarks the fury X
plots in between the gtx 1060 and 1070
in rise of the Tomb Raider with an
average of 77 fps
that made it 15% slower than the gtx
1070 but 24 percent faster than the RX
480
again the fury x can be found hovering
between the gtx 1060 and 1070 though
this time it was closer to the 1070
lagging just 12% behind with 58 FPS at
1440p
using the DirectX 12 API to test the
division we see that the fury X does
very well almost matching the
performance of the gtx 1070 here it was
just 3% faster with an average of 60 FPS
which is impressive to see the fury X
continues its strong form delivering 81
frames per second in hitman making it 1%
faster than the gtx 1070 of course this
is an AMD sponsored tile
but that's an impressive result
nonetheless given what we have seen
previously from quantum break these
results aren't terribly surprising the
fury Rex is only able to keep pace with
the gtx 1060 the 3 gigabyte model mind
you so not great performance here in
relation to the gtx 1070 as it was 23%
slower the fury ax was only able to
match the minimum frame rate of the gtx
1066 gigabyte in overwatch though the
average frame rate was quite a bit
stronger overall the fury ax was 16%
slower than the gtx 1070 doom with
vulcan was one of the games i expected
to go the fury axes way and while it did
here it was 11% faster thanks to a
healthy 155 FPS on average that said the
minimum frame rate was almost identical
to that of the gtx 1070 so overall you
can expect a similar gaming experience
in this title
total war Warhammer has some more
slightly misleading results for us here
the fury ax was one percent faster on
average though that doesn't tell the
entire story as the minimum frame rate
was 13% lower when compared to the gtx
1070 Mirror's Edge catalyst serves up
more typical looking results as the
Furyk sits between the gtx 1060 and 1070
here overall the fury X was 12% well
than 1070 as it delivered an average of
61 FPS at 1440p the fury Rex performs
quite well in f1 2016 despite being 17%
slower than the gtx 1070 not a bad
result and it meant that AMD's last
generation flagship GP was a good bit
faster than the RX 480 and gtx 1060 Deus
Ex mankind divided is another AMD
sponsored title so you would expect the
fury X to perform well here and indeed
it does that said it's still trailed the
gtx 1070 though only by a 2% margin and
here we do see similar minimum frame
rates one of the most popular titles we
benchmark is battlefield 1 and it's
great to see the fury acts so
competitive here an average of 80 FPS
meant that the fury axe was just 7%
slower than the gtx 1070 generally
speaking mafia 3 runs like crap but on
the fury x it's not too bad and the
performance is certainly comparable to
the gtx 1070 as it was just 5% slower
another game where the fury x looks
quite strong is Gears of War 4 here it
was again just 5% slower than the gtx
1070 with an average of 71 fps
the Fuhrer X was just 6% slower than the
gtx 1070 when testing titanfall 2 and
here we see a very healthy 77 FPS on
average at 1440p meanwhile the frame
rates also never dipped below 61 fps in
our 60 second benchmark paths
civilization 6 is another game that we
tested exclusively using DirectX 12
though surprisingly the fury ax is still
9% slower than the gtx 1070 here
moreover it's not a great deal faster
than the RX 480
Call of Duty infinite warfare is a game
where AMD generally does well and this
is true for fury X which was just 6%
slower than the gtx 1070 with a frame
rate of 75 FPS the fury x averaged 77
fps in our dishonored 2 tests which
admittedly isn't conducted in a very
demanding section of the game and we've
done this to avoid a cpu bottleneck
anyway here the fury acts really
struggled and was only able to deliver
similar performance to that of the GTX
10 63 gigabyte finally have watchdogs 2
and again this is another title weather
fury X really struggles the usually here
seem to be vrm and all those stuttering
or any kind of performance he cuts
weren't noticeable or noticed at all the
framerate performance was certainly
limited as a result the fury X was 23%
slower than the gtx 1070 in this title
finally have the power consumption
figures and as you would expect from a
previous generation AMD GPU the numbers
aren't great the fury acts push total
system consumption of 384 watts and that
means the system was consuming 33% more
power when compared to the gtx 1070
configuration still around 350 watts for
a total system load when gaming isn't
exactly shocking and that means our test
system would run happily with an
efficient 500 watt power supply for
example right so we have all the numbers
in from the 16 games tested that were
all released in 2016 so how does the
fury ax stack up against the gtx 1070
well actually before we check the
numbers from this comparison let's first
go back and take a quick look at the
numbers from our original June 2016
video back in June we tested 24 games
and amongst them are some old favorites
that we didn't revisit in this video and
that was mostly because there isn't
anything new to report
anyway what's interesting a note here is
that back then the gtx 1070 was 11% far
in the fury X at 1440p at the time the
big windscreen video came from
battlefield 4 rise of the Tomb Raider
anno 2205 ARMA 3 Just Cause 3 and
interestingly doom of course back then
doom was yet to receive its Vulcan
support so it was a very different
ballgame for AMD with OpenGL where AMD
did do well was with hitman using either
DirectX 11 or DirectX 12 ashes of the
singularity call of duty black ops 3
Batman Arkham Knight and the division
okay so now that the old results are
fresh in our mind let's move on to see
what the updated results have for us the
fury acts was overall 10% slower and if
we flip that around and work out all the
results again we find that the gtx 1070
is also 10% faster so previously it was
11% faster today with newer drivers and
some more modern games thrown to the mix
it's 10% faster previously the fury axe
was 1 percent faster and hitman when
comparing the directrix 11 results and
by testing AMD using dx12 and a.m.
they're using dx11 we get the exact same
result Doom is obviously a big
turnaround for AMD previously the 1070
was 20% faster with OpenGL now with
Vulcan it's 10% slower anyway in spite
of that reshuffling the games and
everything else we find the margins
between the 1070 and fewer X were made
much the same also for those wondering I
did work out the percentage differences
for the minimum frame rate and here the
fury X was 12% slower than the 1070
overall not a significant difference and
there were just two titles where the
fury X struggles more when comparing the
minimum frame rate opposed to the
average still this seems like good news
if you react shoppers providing they can
get one at the right price those cards
selling for thrown eight dollars on
Amazon seem like a decent deal though
they are only 14 percent cheaper than
the cheapest GTX 10 70 or 20% cheaper
than say a typical 1070 but given they
are you know we saw 10% slower on
average you aren't exactly getting the
bargain of the century here so be aware
of that the fury X in my opinion looks
less impressive when compared to that
360 dollar gigabyte Mini ITX OSI model
and down that's a cool little graphics
card it's smaller than the fury X and it
doesn't have a huge radiator hanging off
of
so that's a bonus and it also consumes
considerably less power
the Furious can also be seen struggling
at times with that full gigabyte frame
buffer 4096 stream processes is a lot
and they can certainly efficiently chew
through over four gigabytes of buffered
data anyway unless you're getting the
fury X for $300 or less I probably
wouldn't bother with it given how the
current graphics card landscape looks so
I hope that helps address the furious
question many of you have been asking me
and if you have any questions or any
more questions you know what to do drop
them below so that's pretty much all
from me on this one I'm your host Steve
and I'll catch you next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
