today's video is the very first CPU
related content for 2070 on the channel
and damn do we have a good one for you
today yeah I'm definitely over selling
this finally after more leaks and a
rapidly sinking ship we have the
official release of Intel seventh
generation desktop processors for this
video I have the core i7 7700 K and the
core i5 7600 K models on hand and as you
might have guessed we will be doing a
little benchmarking along with these two
processors Intel will be releasing a
range of locked core i7 core i5 and core
i3 models there is also an unlocked core
i3 processor which we've already looked
at but we expect the price to be far too
high for that one making it a rather
pointless product the information I have
on hand suggests a bulk buy price of 157
us so you can probably expect it to hit
shelves around a hundred and seventy 280
us at that price the skylight core i5
6400 seems like a much better investment
and the same is probably true for the
core i5 7400 which is suggested to cost
around 170 u.s. in 1,000 unit orders
when compared to their skylight
counterparts it looks like the new KB
Lake models are clocked at least 100
megahertz higher well some have as much
as a 300 megahertz clock speed advantage
the core i7 7700 okay for example runs
200 megahertz higher when compared to
the 60s 700 K with a 300 megahertz
higher maximum single core turbo boost
frequency the other noteworthy changes
the upgrade from the HD graphics 532 the
630 version though this does only appear
to be a minor upgrade both models run
their integrated graphics engine add up
to eleven hundred and fifty megahertz
the other processor that we have on hand
is the core i5 7600 K which comes
clocked at 3.8 gigahertz though
depending on load Canon clock as high as
four point two gigahertz of course like
the 7700 K the 7600 K is an unlocked
processor and when paired with a Zed 170
or Zi 270 motherboard it can be
overclocked to operate at greater
frequencies when compared to the 6600 K
the new 7600 K model runs 300 megahertz
faster so this could afford it up to 8%
performance again the updated HD
graphics 630 is also being used here and
the same integrated graphics can also be
found on all of the S series models
Intel is sticking with the LGA 1151
socket for this generation so that means
KB Lake can be used on existing Intel
100 series motherboards providing their
BIOS is up to date however an effort to
add a little spice and probably keep
board partners happy Intel is releasing
their new range of 200 series chipsets
the desktop range will comprise of the Z
- 7 th - 70 be 250 Q 270 and Q 250
chipsets and thews this will be
primarily interested in the Z 270
chipset for a few reasons most notably
of which being that it's the only
chipset to support overclocking of both
the CPU and ddr4 memory the other 270
model being the Q 270 this lacks
overclocking support but picks up a
number of corporate type features such
as Intel vPro technology and Intel
standard manageability for example the
other corporate focused chipset is the Q
250 and as you have no doubt guessed
this is a cut-down version of the Q 270
offering fewer PCIe lanes USB 3 ports
and lacks Intel vPro technology the h2
70 chipset naturally fills the same role
as last generations H 170 basically H
270 boards will appear to those not
buying an unlocked K processor as well
as those who only want to run a single
graphics card which these days is most
of us that said those opting for a core
i3 processor a b250 motherboard might be
the shot when compared to the H 270 you
get far fewer pcie 3.0 lanes at just 12
just 6 USB 3.0 ports 1 M 2 port and a
single PCIe x 16 slot frankly this
configuration is still ample for an
entry-level PC right now we do have
quite a few Z 270 and H 270 motherboards
on hand and I do plan to take a look at
them over the coming weeks but for now
let's check out how the Core i5 and core
i7 cable 8 processors perform before
getting to the games and all that good
stuff let's check out the memory
bandwidth performance the 7700 K and
7600 K were able to produce the
bandwidth of 31 gigabytes per second
which is pretty well on par with the
skylake processors you can clearly see
decent step up from platforms using ddr3
memory now that we are testing with ddr4
exceeding 3,000 megahertz okay so now
that we've checked out the memory
bandwidth the performance time to check
out raw CPU performance using Cinebench
r15 here the seventy-seven okay was
seven percent faster than the 6700 K
while the 7600 K was also seven percent
faster than its skylake counterpart
these 6600 K as we move through the rest
of these tests it's important to keep in
mind the cable eight processes are clock
to seven percent higher than the skylake
models the last synthetic benchmark that
we'll be looking at is PC mark eights
creative test here the 7700 K scored
nine thousand one hundred ninety seven
points making it just three percent
faster than the 6700k meanwhile the
seventy six hundred K scored eight
thousand four hundred and fifty seven
points making it just two percent faster
than the sixty six hundred K the seventy
seven okay was just 5% fast and the
6700k when measuring performance using
7-zip built in benchmark more
surprisingly was the fact that the 7600
K was just one percent faster than the
6600 K the 7700 K completed the Excel
workload in just three point one seconds
making it six percent faster than the
6700k though again keep in mind it is
clocked around seven percent higher
meanwhile the 7600 K was five percent
faster than the sixty six under okay
before moving on to the games let's
check out how long these new CPUs take
to complete our Premiere Pro CC workload
the seventy-seven arcade took just six
hundred and thirty seven seconds which
was a ten percent improvement from the
67 okay not bad
meanwhile the 7600 K was eight percent
faster than the 6600 K okay so now on to
the gaming results please be aware that
due to the fact will be are testing CPU
performance here their settings may seem
a bit unrealistic the idea is take load
off the GPU and place it on the CPU
making that the weakest link
this can help identify which cpu allow
for more consistent performance under
heavy load and likely perform better in
the future as games neva tably become
more demanding so we are testing at
1080p using a Titan XP in games that are
known to use a lot of CPU power games
such as over what you'll be used for
example and overwatch is actually a
really good CPU benchmark
it isn't that demanding on the GPU but
it can take full advantage of an 8
threaded processor for example
especially we're running our bot
benchmark first that we have battlefield
1 and here the 77 ok is able to max out
the Titan XP reaching 166 FPS on average
that said the minimum frame rate was
still able to climb and here these 77
our K was 7% faster than the 6700 K
again I feel the need to remind you that
the 77 our K is also clocked 7% higher
the 7600 K was less impressive only
delivering around 2% more performance
over the 6600 K this time when testing
with cities skylines we see a 9% boost
in performance for the new 77 ok over
the 6700 K when comparing the minimum
frame rate
meanwhile the 7600 K was just 3% faster
than the 6600 K Gears of War 4 is
another very heavy CPU user here the new
core i7 cable 8 process it was 3% faster
than the old skylake process so when
comparing the minimum frame rate while
these 7600 K was just 2% faster than the
6600 K so pretty weak gains for the
cable 8 processes in this title f1 2016
isn't that heavy on the CPU but we
included it anyway
again the 7700 K was just 3% fast in the
6700 K while the 7600 K was just 4%
faster than the 6600 K over watch is
limited to a 300 fps cap and the new
cable a core i7 along with the 59 60 X
had no trouble pushing the Titanic speed
to that cap looking at the minimum frame
rate the 7700 K was 7% fast and the 67
ok meanwhile the 7600 K was just 2%
faster than the 6600 K which was a bit
disappointing to find total war
Warhammer is the only DirectX 12 game
that we've used for testing here we once
again see some very mild gains from the
higher clocked kb lake processes when
compared to sky lake it seems that for
cause is ideal for maximum performance
in this title as the lower clocked 59 60
X really falls behind
losing out too many of them more
recently released higher clocked Core i5
processors finally we have the insanely
CPU demanding title that is watchdogs to
the 77 ok average 91 FPS making it just
a single frame faster than the 6700
meanwhile the 7600 K was just 2 FPS
faster than the 6600 okay so again yet
another disappointing result for KB Lake
I've seen a heap of kb lake news over
the past few months suggesting that the
integrated graphics has been vastly
improved upon this was surprising to me
as on paper very little looks to have
changed
comparing the unlocked KB Lake and
skylight chips in the Tomb Raider reboot
2012 Sleeping Dogs and rocket League
suggests that very little has changed
using the normal or medium quality
settings in Tomb Raider at 1080p allowed
for an average of just 31 fps and that
was just 1 FPS faster than the skylight
chips rocket League actually played a
reasonably well considering with an
average of 43 fps using the quality
preset which is essentially a medium
type quality setting again we are
testing at 1080p so no bad result
despite only being a few FPS improvement
over skylake Sleeping Dogs play with an
average of 37 FPS though it did dip down
to as low as 24 FPS at times this time
the cable 8 processors were on average 3
FPS faster for a 9% performance
improvement here we have the total
system power consumption figures
recorded when running the Excel workload
as you can see the cable a process has
only consumed a few watts less than the
skylight models still given they are
clocked roughly 7 percent faster the
fact that we are seeing power savings
here is decent of course the efficiency
improvement isn't amazing but it is the
most impressive result we've seen so far
using a power bug program like prime95
we see that the 7700 K pushes total
system consumption to 148 watts
while the 7600 K reach just 126 watts
again this made them slightly more
efficient than the skylight counterparts
so far the 7700 K and 7600 K look ok
they've provided small performance
boosts over the equivalent skylake
processors while consuming a little less
power that seems like a win-win and it's
pretty well in line with the baby steps
that we've come to expect from the
modern-day Intel however as I noted a
few times we often saw gains of around
7% or less with the cable 8 processors
and that's an issue because they're
clocked around 7% higher so
what happens if we level the playing
field well let's find out okay so that's
disappointing o'clock four o'clock at
4.5 gigahertz the 6700k and 7700 K
deliver virtually the same performance
in fact it really is the same
performance certainly error of margin
stuff the same is also true for the 6600
K and 7600 K clock for clock they're
essentially the same processes in terms
of performance previously the 7700 K and
7600 K were slightly faster in Gears of
War for now in match clock for clock
they're indistinguishable from the
skylight processes for those wondering
this was also true for other games
tested as well such as overwatch for
example these new KB Lake processes were
quite good when it came to overclocking
using just 1.33 volts I managed a 100%
stable overclock at 4.9 gigahertz using
one point four volts it was possible to
reach five gigahertz but keeping the
CPUs cool wasn't an easy task
I could even load into Windows at up to
five point one gigahertz though at this
frequency it wasn't possible to complete
all our stress tests in comparison our
6700 K processor maxed out at 4.8
gigahertz using the same 1.3 3 volts and
going as high as one point 4 5 volts
wouldn't stabilize the chip at 4.9
gigahertz so it seems when it comes to
overclocking KB Lake is good for another
100 to 200 megahertz certainly not a
mind-blowing result but it will no doubt
keep overclockers happy using a fairly
basic all-in-one liquid cooler the 7700
K did hit 95 degrees at 4.9 gigahertz
the cooler used was the deep cool
captain 120 ax those overclocking this
chip will want something with at least a
240 millimeter radiator attached if I
create an overclocking guide I'll
certainly be using a more extreme
cooling solution out-of-the-box using
the same deep cool liquid cooler the
core i7 7700 ki tled at 31 degrees and
then under load one as high as 77
degrees the 6700 K was then installed in
the same system it all 30 degrees but
under loaded 81 degrees
I had read reports indicating that 77 RK
was a much hotter chip than the 6700 K
that certainly isn't the case when
comparing my two chips low ok so we've
now looked at out-of-the-box performance
for both the core i7 7700 okay
and core i5 7600 processes we've looked
at clock clock performance overclocking
performance temperatures power
consumption and integrated graphics
performance out of the box the KB Lake
processes were for the most part five to
seven percent faster than the equivalent
skylight processes of course as noted
they are clocked around seven percent
higher and when running a few clock for
clock tests we discover that there is no
difference at all between Kaiba Lake and
sky lake so that's a disappointing no
IPC gains to be seen then efficiency has
been slightly improved though as some
have pointed out Intel has been selling
14 nanometer CPUs for 18 months now so
the process has inevitably matured in
that time and this will help to improve
efficiency overclocking looks to be
slightly better with KB Lake and our
sample suggests that overclockers can
look forward to squeezing out another
100 200 megahertz I have seen reports of
terrible temperatures for the core i7 77
ok so I don't want to say conclusively
that it runs cooler than the 67 or ok
but mine certainly does that's that I
have an earlier engineering sample and
looking at the data available online my
67 ok certainly seems to run hotter than
the typical retail chip ultimately for
desktop users the upgrade from skylake
to KB Lake obviously isn't viable even
for those running a Haswell or Broadwell
process of the incentive to upgrade to
Intel's latest platform just isn't there
meanwhile those who purchased a core i7
4770k two and a half years ago are
probably sitting there scratching their
head wondering where they go next and I
can tell you it certainly isn't the 7700
he'll if we look at the 4.5 gigahertz
alts we see that even the Ivor bridge
3770k is hanging in there it's a good
bit faster than the 7600 K anyway even
the 2600 K max out quite well only
trailing the 67 okay and 7700 K by a 23%
margin in Gears of War for a very CPU
intensive game that was tested with what
is currently the most powerful gaming
GPU available I guess for now we'll have
to wait and see what aim DS rise and has
to offer mainstream performance users in
the end KB Lake looks like it's not much
more than a sky like refresh and frankly
this is how I feel Intel should have
tried to pass it off but I guess for OMS
and reach
our six general refresh doesn't quite
have the same impact as an entirely new
seventh gen product line
what's that sir you have an old sixth
generation system you'll want to upgrade
that to a new seventh generation model
they are much faster anyway for us and
throughs it looks like a nother
disappointingly small baby step perhaps
I'm being overly negative let me know
what you think in the comments below
I'm always keen to hear what you have to
say for now though that concludes my
cable 8 coverage I'm your host Steve and
I'll catch you on the next one
