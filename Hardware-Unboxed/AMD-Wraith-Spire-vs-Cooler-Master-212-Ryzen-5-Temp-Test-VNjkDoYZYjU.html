mmm start again hey guys welcome back
for another hardware unbox video today
we're talking temps so things could get
a little hot though they probably won't
get Fermi hot recently I set out to
determine if it's worth paying the
premium for the horizon 5 1600 x over
the standard 1600 model especially if
you plan to overclock the 1600 X is
price just 14% or $30.00 us more but for
me the biggest issue is the fact that
the Wraith spire cooler is dropped from
the package the spire is aimed is new 95
watt box cooler and it works rather well
it also looks quite nice too the spire
will allow rise in five owners to
overclock though as you start to near
the CPUs limits things do get quite hot
now the X rated chips are meant to offer
greater overclocking Headroom thanks to
the bidding process though we have seen
little evidence of this that said with
Verizon's very limited overclocking
potential we have found little
difference between the various models
for example we have come across 1600 X
models that are limited to 3.9 Gigot
while we have tested 1600 chips that are
good for 4.1 gigahertz so as always it
comes down to the silicon lottery
I wouldn't recommend buying the 1600 X
over the 1600 because you believe it
will ensure great overclocking Headroom
again it just seems to be luck of the
draw at this point anyway a few viewers
did raise some interesting questions
that I didn't address in my previous
video things like if you already have a
good aftermarket cooler that's a m4
compatible is it worth buying the 1600 X
or if you plan to overclock the base
model 1600 to the max should you ditch
the box colour anyway and pick up a
proven budget performer such as cooler
masters 212 for the first question again
I would still up for the cheaper 1600
with the 1600 X nothing is guaranteed
and I'm not even sure if your odds are
any better at this point $30.00 US isn't
a huge amount of money but still why
waste it now when it comes to maximum
overclock
getting four gigahertz or beyond if
possible should you upgrade the cooler
anyway
well the rave spire does work at forward
gigahertz and with the default fan
profile on my gigabyte be 350 board it's
not even that loud that said though it
is very hot so for those of you who
requested it I have decided to compare
the Wraith spire to the cooler master
212 on their eyes and 5 1,600 1,500 X
and 1400 please note the 1600 and 1500 X
do come with the Wraith spire while the
1400 comes with a smaller cooler a 65
watt model known as the Wraith stealth
the stealth won't be able to handle a
full gigahertz overclock so for that
particular CPU you will need to upgrade
the cooler here are a few quick notes
testing was conducted on the gigabyte a
be 350 gaming 3 motherboard and using
this board the 1400 was limited to 3.9
gigahertz the 1500 X reach 3.9 5
gigahertz and the 1600 was still good
for 4 gigahertz that said all three
processors can achieve 4 gigahertz in my
a m4 test system which uses the asrock X
370 Taichi the 1600 can even hit 4.1
gigahertz comfortably on that board
overclocked all three CPUs were running
at one point 4 volts the cooler master
hyper 212 is a super popular aftermarket
cooler as it costs just $20 u.s. and
does a really good job on hand now I
only have the 212 turbo which features
an additional 120 millimeter fan taking
the grand total to 2 thankfully though
this model does feature a m4 socket
support right out of the box to mimic
base model 212 performance I have tested
with just a single 120 millimeter fan
installed finally for measuring
temperatures we used hardware monitor
version one point 31 and according to
AMD this does accurately report
operating temperatures of all their eyes
and processes first up let's see what
kind of gains the 212 can offer before
any overclocking even takes place with
the Wraith spire all three rows and five
processors peaked at a little over 60
degrees which is very respectable for a
box cooler particularly given how quiet
it is that said there is still room for
huge temperature improvements with the
212
especially for the 1400 the budget quad
core temperatures drop by almost 30%
with the aftermarket cooler meanwhile
the 1500 X ray and 17% cooler and the 6
914 percent cooler the idle temperatures
they were all much the same but this is
to be expected okay so now on to the
overclocking results this is where
things get a bit dicey with the raise
spire that said though the cooler was
still reasonably quiet although it was
audible over the case fans
it wasn't exactly loud so you could spin
up the fan a bit harder under load to
rein in those temperatures a bit more
using the default fan profiler 1600 and
1500 X were getting close to hitting 90
degrees and that's not far from the 95
degrees thermal limit moving to the 212
did reduce temperatures massively
dropping the 1600 from 89 degrees to
just 68 degrees a massive 24% reduction
so 212 and it's single 120-millimeter
found were extremely quiet and certainly
couldn't be heard over the case fans
this then makes it a worthwhile upgrade
for those that do plan to overclock so
as impressive as AMD's Box cooler is
when compared to the junk Intel include
with their CPUs it's still no substitute
for a decent tower style cooler still
though if you can handle a bit of fan
noise then winding the fan speed up
should keep the temperatures in check
even at 4 gigahertz so I'd probably opt
for something like cooler masters 212
given how significant the thermal
improvements were and for me this really
makes buying the cheaper 9 X 1600 even
easier to justify the $30.00 you save
can go towards buying a 212 and you're
basically breaking even on that purchase
that should have us covered for this one
guys but as always if you have any
questions feel free to drop them below
and I'll do my best to answer them I'm
your host Steve see you again soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
