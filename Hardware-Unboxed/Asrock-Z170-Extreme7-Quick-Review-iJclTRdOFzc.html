your host Matt and today we're taking a
look at the brand new Zeb 170
motherboard from ads Rock the extreme 7
plus earlier this month Intel releases
first batch of skylake processors with
the core i7 6700 k and the core i5 6600
k unfortunately they only offered a very
minor performance bump over existing
house or processes which was pretty
disappointing however skylights updated
platform does bring high-speed ddr4
memory to the mainstream and a
cutting-edge chipset known as the Z 170
there's already a huge number of dev 170
motherboards to choose from ranging in
price from just a hundred dollars all
the way up to five hundred dollars for
most people though the best value boards
we found somewhere in the middle with
motherboard such as the ads Rob Zeb 170
extreme 7 plus which can be had for just
two hundred and forty dollars rather
than running a heap of benchmarks the
kind of inconsequential as all Zedd 170
motherboards will deliver the same
performance we're instead going to focus
on the many new features that adds rocks
crammed onto this board other than the
board itself we also find included in
the package a quick installation guide
and support CD there's also fourth side
of data cables an i/o shield 2-way SLI
bridge three screws for the m2 sockets
and one screw for the mini PCIe slot
we've also got a special USB 3.1 front
panel designed to fit into a five and a
quarter bay the front panel uses the
motherboards internal SATA Express
header to provide USB 3.1 type A and
type CD ports in the front of your case
asrock uses a third-party controller in
the device itself to go from the pc i
expressed USB 3.1 interface so it looks
like finally after a year or so
someone's come up with a useful
application for those unused SATA
Express sports the front panel comes the
power cable SATA Express cable and a USB
2.0 cable power cable enables faster
charging thanks for 3m rating while the
USB 3 type-c port features a reversible
design and will support modern devices
the asrock said 170 extreme 7 plus is a
stunning-looking motherboard that's
heavy on
features included to the 12 power
failures design of the CPU and as rocks
matte black PCB which has been garnished
in their new black and copper heat sinks
and shields the i/o panel impurity sound
3 has been dressed when a drug call that
I 0 armour they say this newly designed
cover protect crucial parts near the
motherboards rear I oh so they won't
easily be damaged by static electricity
truth be told it's more of an aesthetic
design choice and it makes the board
look pretty badass networking support
comes from a pair of Intel controllers
the I to 19 v and an i 2 1 180 which
supports teaming wake-on-lan
energy-efficient Ethernet and as rocks
full spark protection there are plenty
of USB options and now Rob has even
included in asme dr ASM 1142 controller
on board which provides USB 3.1 a and
USB 3.1 see on the i/o panel elsewhere
on the board you get a total of eight
USB 3 ports two headers and four we are
and eight usb2 ports three headers and
two rear as our expiry sound three is
included which is powered by the realtek
alc 1150 codec supporting 7.1 channel
high definition audio the purity sound 3
package includes nichicon fine gold
series audio caps 115 jezebel snr DAC
with differential amplifier and a TI NE
5532 premium headset amplifier that
supports up to 600 ohm headsets there
are four full-length pcie x 16 slots on
offer although they are not created
equally the first or primary pcie x 16
slot is connected to the LGA 1151
processor and can achieve full pcie 3.0
x 16 bandwidth with a single graphics
card while the secondary slot is limited
to a pci three times for bandwidth as
it's connected to the chipset the third
slot is connected to the cpu for pci e 3
times 8 and then the fourth is also
connected to the cpu though it's limited
to pci e 3 times for bandwidth so
technically a three-way GPU setup would
be configured as a times 8 times 4 times
4 arrangement from the cpu the Zep 170
extreme 7 plus also supports three
ultram two slots so you
should note that the share with the
sadder and sadder express sports for
example if the first M 2 slot is in use
and the first and second SATA ports will
be disabled if you would use all three M
two slots then at least six of the ten
SATA port to be disabled so while on
paper the Zeb 170 extreme 7 plus looks
to offer a huge amount of storage
options with three SATA Express ports 3m
two slots and ten SATA ports in reality
the amount of storage that can be
supported is fairly standard for example
if you used all tense I deportes then
it'd be impossible to use the m2 and
SATA Express options therefore I
wouldn't say it is there 170 extreme
seven plusses storage rich but rather
very flexible when it comes to storage
options which is a good thing at this
price around at the i/o panel there's
legacy ps2 keyboard and mouse connector
along with two usb2 ports there are four
USB 3 ports two USB 3.1 ports dual
Gigabit LAN ports five audio jacks and
an optical s/pdif Airport the display
outputs include a DVI port HDMI port and
a displayport 1.2 connector as rockers
certainly managed to pack a lot into the
Zeb 170 extreme 7 plus and we
particularly enjoyed the flexible
storage options and of course that USB
3.1 front panel module of course the
extreme 7 plus also looks amazing and is
definitely one of the better looking Zeb
170 motherboards that we've come across
as we've come to expect from asrock the
board competitively priced for around
the same price the lesser equipped ROG
Maximus eight ranger can be had or the
MS is dead 179 a gaming m7 so we feel as
rockers delivered a solid offering with
Zeb 117 extreme 7 plus thanks for
watching this motherboard review this
