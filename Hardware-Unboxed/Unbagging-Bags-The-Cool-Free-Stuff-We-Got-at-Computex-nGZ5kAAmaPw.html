description now to learn more welcome
back to harbor unbox tim myself are
wrapping up Computex coverage while
we're pretty much done with editing
filming light sort of stuff
and we have a few bags here that we
thought we might unbag yeah I reckon so
so we're sort of doing an unboxing boxes
episode but it's unbagging bags Computex
2018 edition we'll see what things we've
got Tim did a bit of running around the
showroom floor on the last day of
filming grabbed quite a few bags so
let's see what loot he did end up
getting hopefully some good stuff so you
want to grab a bag Tim and we'll check
which Amish we start with we Mazal start
with that one because you did that at
the end of your video anyway so yeah
here we go
so this is the asrock bag it's quite
large I've got a little green bag
through here Steve oh nice ahaha that's
right the cat so if you didn't miss
Tim's video which which one was that
that was the Intel coverage Intel Zed
390 at the Ayers Rock booth and so Tim's
already slightly different hat to me
different hat is that yeah I might have
got a gray one yeah I think you did so
how's that look let me know in the
comments below sure it looks fine
but anyway yeah pretty cool cap there
from asrock and this massive phantom
gaming mouse pad that you can sort of
see here nice a Radeon logo in the top
there as rocks huge so will be good for
your keyboards and yeah you love these
sort of things nice I do like the big s
or Tomatoes ones I really look at mine
oh yeah
it is red young theme what you say so
yes the new fans from gaming yeah looks
awesome I reckon I like the red edge and
yeah pretty cool shape good size that
before that to use so that the same one
you got yes I got two of these and then
a gray cap and a black cap bag number
two Corsair bag looking good
you can go get some goodies in here
that's something for you okay so we've
got their lighting no two pro kit so
that is their RGB lighting comes with a
controller and we have so some pretty
good lighting there that'll be good for
a build if I rave RGB lighting which
seems unlikely but we have quite a few
lighting strips available oh yeah I open
it up and have a quick look I suppose so
I've got here there USB stick so
riveting stuff there are bits a 32 gig
USB so that's a good us baby handy and a
unless Corsair bottle opener he would
get some b-roll of that looks pretty
cool I've also got here in this little
plastic bag it's one of these things
that people are attackin two phones
these days you know they chuck this on
the back of their phone makes a bit
easier to grip okay so there's one of
those as well
and another things were on this little
bag here is a Corsair notepad and pen so
not a trained team how to use a pen yeah
I've got no idea
just something haven't been needing to
use for a white snow style acid a ink
comes out at the end of it yeah
satisfying click that's what you want
right yep tactile feedback ah so yeah a
little controller here sonic power cord
and it looks like there's three LED
light strips and they have adhesive on
the back or they're magnetic so that's
actually four I can count know what
they're about 20 centimetres yep that
means does it say they look about 20
centimetres I'm not particularly
familiar with this kit but it doesn't
matter we've got some RGB light so
Corsair never fails to deliver when it
comes to the RGB lighting
coolermaster take a look inside that one
and coolermaster go free
pretty good looking bag there okay so
we've got the standard sort of catalog
brochure thing so that's more just
advertising all their products but there
are some it's not nice product rocks in
there some good at work yeah good 3d
rendered stuff so really heavy box here
so I do get to unbox something so nice
nice I think we've got two of these from
cool master and to the Corsair kits as
well so yeah it's always nice to go and
get these show bags from the floor get a
couple each dan what's in there so
that's a aluminium sort of a case there
with a zip so actually all hopefully
nothing falls out of this I don't know
how we good
oh that's pretty cool so we get a
full-blown toolkit very nice
so some allen keys got some heads got
some Phillips heads nice little
screwdriver there episode of trips like
pliers awesome it's actually a pretty
good thing to be given in a bag yeah oh
it's so tape measure I can reach the
edge of these strips now perfect that's
why we have you around Tim gonna hold
that in there you go hard we're
measuring right here what's that looks
like we're 30 so now it's 30 centimetres
not man gee I didn't think that Benny
wait that's fine 30 there you go
lucky we had this hero would have been
giving you guys false information so
that's a technically accurate unbagging
slash unboxing well okay if you're close
look at that that's pretty cool
grab the MSI stuff I reckon yeah well we
got an MSI did we get an MSI bag oh no I
just got this stuff from their booth you
played a quick little game come on MSI
where it's hard you're a major sponsor
and we don't get a bag we you played a
funny game at the booth we walked past
the booth and one of the guys there
didn't know who we were
which is fine I just thought we were I
don't know right well we are random
people I suppose yeah but he pulled us
in he said play this game you can win
some MSI loot my life yeah okay
do that so eyes up winning the game
quite easily it was extremely easy game
so either that I'm very skilled with a
mouse but it was like they had like what
would do some shots of it so I throw
some b-roll but yeah so it was a game we
won but the cool thing was we got some
little puzzle which isn't particularly
cool but it's a 100 piece putt 1998
piece puzzle 20 by 29 centimeters it
says MSI turns all gamers dreams into
reality with some artwork on it so so
yeah I'm putting that together maybe
yeah that'll be we'll get some b-roll of
that going together one cool thing we
got was this little mini ITX ruler
that's the form factor for this ruler 15
centimetres long I tweeted out some
pictures of this one we want it but yeah
it's pretty cool really cool all right
yeah I see base stuff on the PCB rulers
are really really cool so it's about as
thick as the PCB on Intel processors
these days yeah it's pretty cool so it's
happy to win that so this is from deep
coolers and at the game store and yep so
yeah we went past the deep cool booth
and they gave us this I like that just
the bag it sells pretty cool and I
believe just looking at this box that
this is some tea or something yeah I'm
not upset sure on that looks like it
open one I don't have a look little
individual baggies inside there that say
tieguanyin are probably absolutely
butchered that but yeah it says it looks
like yep ty ty tige one yeah I don't
know see here's some this isn't weed is
it no no this is tea that's me -
imaginative dude bulgaria swede it
smells okay actually but it's probably
like you know many many different little
baggies in each one probably brews a pot
or something so hopefully Australian
customers lets us take that back in I
think there before we drop it everywhere
thank you for the tea Tim's probably not
that up for trying
random Taiwanese drinks at this point
you have got a beauty drinks yesterday
after megamix yeah for megamix if you
don't know we're talking about watch our
livestream it would probably be two days
ago at this point so we've got this damn
D s is that how you pronounce their
company name I'm gonna say yes because I
don't know yes yeah I don't ever got
that so this is just a bag we've got
some stuff from them and a lot of stuff
from other companies okay so or
deceitful stuff so we've got this take a
look at that and I might grab out both
of these things were given to us by and
yes so so this looks like the hides
yep mail so maybe the rest that's after
boom gaming mouse all right let's um
this is a k world elite gaming earphone
s22
and I'll give you some b-roll of this
logo Steve but doesn't that logo look
relatively familiar to you like another
major gaming company no I love how
discreet it is it's the same color and
everything so bad
bonus phone memory tips and says base
ultra base on it so you're not just
getting base you're getting also ultra
base so it's good thing to be aware of
stunning sound for your gameplay from
Kay wall it's not it's not the other
major gaming company it's K world so
interests it actually looked reasonably
good they've got a braided cable in them
some stickers well looks like this has
some extra grips and things that could
be pretty cool if I can get them out
these are fairly fairly basic headphones
reasonably cheap I'm just interested to
see how the base ultra base goes the
patented dual air chamber structure I
gotta have that yes and the widest sound
range to enrich your listening
experience so give those a shot in a
moment see how those go but how do we
pull away I think you've got the you've
got the cool stuff here from yeah this
mask yeah this mouth looks pretty cool
yeah and you say you can change the it's
got like magnetic side bits that you can
yeah change
so that one pops it oh yeah there you go
that was just a bit bigger sort of
catches your finger a bit better they're
nice and rubberized it's actually really
like sticky in a good way Wow
yeah that's grippy yeah it's really
groovy it's good it's quite a wide mouth
I guess with the ones that you've put on
now at the moment probably bit wider
than I'd normally use but it certainly
got multiple buttons nice feeling scroll
wheel there it's got a dpi button on it
as well that's super sticky on there
yeah well feel that that piece there so
I don't know if yeah you can get rid of
oh okay so you can put that in there to
make it really thin and there you go
super grippy as well with that super
grippy but you can make it a really
narrow Mouse so you can make it yeah so
I'm sure this is a probably Ghamdi s or
gamed yes whatever these they sell the
Hades that's a pretty cool Mouse braided
cable USB let's get out via the rest of
the goodie bag that we've got here I
thought we would just be getting like
really rubbish stuff things is what is
that I believe is from alpha cool so
does stress Paul is a stress ball and in
this that is cool
so I went over to the Alpha cool booth
and the guys there were just chilling
out and I was like I'm filming this
video about you know just random stuff
the people giving away on the show floor
and they gave me a watch what yeah I
know what I thought we weren't supposed
to be only just little plastic key
things that you throw away so it says
watch it says alpha cool on it like you
can see there some metal design much
we'll throw some b-roll up of that but
yeah I mean as far as the giveaway he's
go like that's a pretty good giveaway
item that way by the awful this ball was
cool I like the ball it balls awesome
yeah but getting a watch from the show
for not bad not bad at all got a watch
we've got a toolkit we've got a mouse
we've got some ear buds we've got a 32
gig USB stick that was worth coming just
for that and a lighting kit with 30
centimeter later I've also got in here
obviously you just get lots of pens at
the show for so I've got some big white
pins and essen core pen but at the be
quiet booth I'll track up a picture of
this for you guys they were giving away
beer
you could actually know the only booth I
saw with this you could go up you could
get some Taiwanese beer it's actually
Taiwanese B is not too bad so I've
rocked up over there like 5 p.m. after a
hard day on her eyes wall press surprise
she came back slammed down a beer and it
was a pretty good so thanks be quite for
shouting me a beer on the showroom floor
I also got in here just some leaflets
and there's one other thing I think that
I want to show off which is this from
the Thermaltake booth ok I'll take got
for us might take a little while to i
inflate this oh no this is definitely
getting left behind TT eSports what is a
sword yep oh boy so I'm gonna have to
inflate this I will be back in about 15
minutes so good luck Tim hopefully Tim
isn't passed out in that time so now
we've got a while work out who gets to
keep all these things I'm not used to
blowing such large items I think that's
good I think I've got it no easy TT
eSports by Thermaltake right here so not
too practical as a sword thanks for that
so thanks are thermaltake visit them yep
alright so I guess that ends our
unbagging experience from Computex 2018
got a whole bunch of pretty cool stuff
actually I thought like the tool kit and
the watch and that sort of yeah he's
definitely better than some of the
passages and course they gave us some
RGB light strips so so yeah certainly
not some some sort of junk that will be
taken back yeah well I pretty much take
all that back I'm not sure about the
sword but their reason weight limit in
our bags it's already pretty much a
limit so I lost a little bit of money to
bring most of this stuff back but I
could wear the watch we'll take it in
our carry-on they won't check there
surely hopefully not
yeah good stuff I think yeah anyway good
year this year had a lot of fun
I was really fun being able to show
atones an awesome place and you always
get to see a whole bunch of cool stuff
so yeah it's really good yeah perhaps
some cool drinks
yeah so if you enjoyed the livestream
and yeah but looking forward to getting
back now and getting back into the
regular content we've got a few
benchmark videos and private reviews
that we want to get done straight away
so yeah right into that anyway we can
say that is going to do it for this one
yep so we will see you in another video
really soon
see you in Australia charts
good bagging competence 2018 edition we
gonna do that again right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
