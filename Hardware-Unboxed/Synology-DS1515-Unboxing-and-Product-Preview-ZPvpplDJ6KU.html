i'm your host Matt and today we're going
to unbox the synology ds1 5 15 the Noosa
knowledge EDS 15.5 is the budget edition
of the ds1 5 15 plus launched a few
months ago and it's designed to be a
network storage solution for growing
businesses the specs haven't changed a
great deal the significantly lower price
tag will come as a welcome change most
notably the quad-core intel atom
processor has been replaced with a more
affordable and a perna labs am chip
rather than the four USB 3 ports you get
on the ds1 5 15 plus you get just two on
this model and also the two gigabytes of
ddr3 memory is not upgradeable let's
open up the box now and take a look
inside this first box we've got one
network cable instead of screws another
network cable power cable and finally
your keys next up we've got the welcome
quick installation guide and now we get
to the unit itself
so it's packed in nicely with some thick
white foam you've got another protective
layer alrighty let's take a look at the
unit itself now so across the front
we've got the status LED alert LED and
you know a power button it's a blue LED
backlit you've also got lamb one two
three and four we've got five hot
swappable drives that it can be
individually locked as well with the
keys we saw before and they pop out nice
and easy on the side we've got a nice
synology grill which does allow some
ventilation as well on the back we've
got to fans for cooling good three pin
power connector Eastsider one down the
bottom left in the east side of two on
the bottom right your four gigabit lan
ports on the right-hand side and then
it's just the two USB 3 ports at the top
right on the bottom just got for
rubberized feet and that's just about it
there you have it a quick unboxing of
the synology diskstation 15.5 price is
650 dollars the d/s 1515 looks to be
pretty good value that were yet to

in-depth look at the d/s 1515 and please
