we're going to take a look at some
benchmarks as well as discuss a few
things recently there's been a heap of
controversy surrounding rising benchmark
results and opinions given by reviewers
as well as how the reviewers are
actually testing by some miracle I
managed to dodge a lot of the rising
controversy particularly with my release
day video though making this video might
change that but I really hope it doesn't
because everyone is entitled to their
opinion the road to my rise in review
was also extremely bumpy and I think I
did a pretty good job of showing the
current strengths and weaknesses while
overall remaining objective after all as
I noted in my initial Rison review this
is a new platform and a totally new CPU
architecture so they're bound to be
teething problems that said the entire
reason I review products at all is to
give you the viewer consumer advice so
that advice to carry any merit it has to
be backed up by solid testing preferably
testing done by myself an impartial
party that you guys can trust since the
initial rise and reviews went live it
almost seems like the Internet has been
on fire at least the nerd portion of it
anyway so the last week my youtube
comment spam filter has been flooded
with links to an adored TV video a video
I actually watched just moments after it
went live so I was already aware of it
I'm an adored TV fan I often stop by and
let Jim know how much I enjoy his videos
and support his work the video a few
users were spamming on every tech
channel that I was aware of was titled
risin the tech press loses the plot
starting our video one of the first
things Jim talked about was the amazing
productivity performance and how the
results almost brought a tear to his eye
well I have to admit to having similar
feelings when I fired that premiere for
the first time I was shaking with
excitement and almost couldn't believe
the result
I felt like jumping for joy we finally
had a real contender and reviewers like
myself could start recommending
something else in the same old core i3
Core i5 and core i7 processors however
the point of that video was to discuss
how the tech media benchmark CPU gaming
performance now before I get to that I
would just like to make a few things
clear things I have been saying since
day one I do believed in the future the
horizon 7 CPUs will likely beat the sky
and cable a core i7 quad-core processors
the IPC performance is certainly there
and they obviously have more resources
to work with so once games become more
demanding and take advantage of those
resources things should start to head in
AMD's favor as I said in my GPU
bottlenecking video I just don't know
how far into the future that will be and
so somebody building a system today that
is a consideration if horizon 7 isn't
able to hit full stride and 2/3 or maybe
even four years in games then for gaming
you are better off buying a core i7
processor now and upgrading down the
track of course if you do any kind of
productivity or content creation with
your PC then again as I said in my first
rise in review you are much better off
going with AMD at this point where I
disagree with Jim is how CPU should be
tested I strongly believe removing a GPU
bottleneck to test actual CPU gaming
performance is how it should be done
just as it always has been
now shortly after that video went live
droves of YouTube viewers came to my
channel and other tech channels spouting
about how the AMD FX series is now
faster than Sandy Bridge something like
10 percent faster on average when
looking at a large number of modern
games that to me just didn't sound right
I often benchmarked both these processes
when testing new games and it's
extremely rare that the FX processes are
even able to match the core i5 2500 K
and I've never seen them match to Core
i7 2600k the claim here was that the FX
83 70 is now faster than the 2500 K and
again this had me scratching my head as
it wasn't that long ago that I compared
the two and it was a one-sided beatdown
rewind to when the bulldozer
architecture was first announced we
noted at the time that gaming
performance was down due to a lack of
utilization as games of the time back in
2011 we're only using about to cause the
FX 83-70 is of course based upon 2011
revised piledriver architecture but the
same theory applied so we always
expected performance would improve
that's that we knew would never get
anywhere near the level of the core i7
processes of the time and unless I've
missed something it never did the 2500 K
on the other hand is just a quad core
part and it does lack hyper-threading
support so it was possible that the
eight core FX processors could
eventually nudge ahead
last year we started to see this
dialect core i7 CPU is pulling ahead of
the core i5 models wouldn't pair with
the gtx eternity graphics card or
something fast like the titan XP in
games such as battlefield one
civilization 6 deus ex mankind divided
f1 2016 Gears of War 4 hitman mafia 3
watchdogs 2 overwatch and the list goes
on so we are clearly starting to see
games require more than four cores and
as a result the quad core Core i7 models
are already starting to benefit from
their hyper threading support so does
this mean after all these years those
eight core FX processors are starting to
make a comeback we figured they might at
some point but after years of getting
messed up by modern Core i3 processors I
honestly thought the day may never come
since I just finished testing the rise
in CPUs along with the FX 83 70 and 16
games many of which are modern I thought
why not go back and add the core i5 2500
K to the results so this is exactly what
I've done and the results are
interesting though for the most part not
all that surprising for testing I again
went with the Pascal Titan X and an
effort to remove any GPU bottlenecks
so did chest at 1440p as well as 1080p
the FX 83-70 was tested with ddr3 2400
memory while the 2500 K was paired with
ddr3 2133 memory all the clock speeds
are stocks or the 2500 K would boost as
high as 3.7 gigahertz and the FX 83-70
as high as 4 point 3 gigahertz ok I
think that covers all the important
details let's get to it
kick starting the benchmarks we have the
division and even at 1080p we are
primarily GPU bound here the 2500 K did
deliver a better result and while an 8%
greater minimum frame rate is nothing to
scoff at the FX 83-70 did deliver
reasonably smooth performance in this
title
I've leaves out at 1440p the FX 83-70
falls further behind which is unexpected
the 2500 case minimum frame rate is now
18 percent greater we have another
mostly GPU bound game in for honor
though the minimum frame rate is quite
telling here the 2500 K despite
delivering a more impressive average
frame rate was actually 13% slower when
looking at the all-important minimum
frame rate here we see the 2500 K is on
par with the much-loved Pentium G 4560
moving to 1440p the 2500 K is now just
2% sold in the FX 83-71 can
minimum frame rate while it delivered
the same 109 FPS average next up we have
the very CPU intensive Gears of War fall
and here the 2500 K was 38% faster than
the FX AVC 70 delivering an average of
one hundred and 60 FPS compared to just
77 fps the minimum frame rate was much
closer though here the 2500 K was 14%
faster moving to 1440p we again find the
2500 K well ahead delivering 38% more
performance with an average of 105 fps
this made the 2500 case slightly faster
than the chloro 370 350 K and much
faster than the FX 83-70 the 2500 cables
are heading our 12 player bot tests
which runs for 5 minutes and I take the
average number from 3 runs here in the
2500 K was 5% faster when comparing the
minimum frame rate and 10% faster for
the average moving to 1440p the margins
remain much the same so a clear win here
for the 2500 K in what is a very CPU
demanding game next up we have another
CPU demanding title in Civilization 6
and here the FX 83-70 gets left well
behind delivering similar performance
for the pentium g 4560 meanwhile the
2500 K is well ahead producing 24% more
frames the FX processor also gets wiped
out completely at 1440p as it turns in
another poor result well I actually came
back after completing all my tests
Andreea round the numbers in Deus Ex
mankind divided only to find the same
results the minimum frame rate for the
2500 K was 33% greater while the average
figure was 46% greater the Sandy Bridge
processor leaves the FX 83 74 dead here
and the same can also be seen at 1440p
as a side note I did compile many of my
benchmark numbers before I had any rosin
CPUs in hand so at the time I was
unaware they had issues with DirectX 12
in this title as well as a few other
titles I had actually tested with the
assumption that the more modern API
would actually favor AMD anyway going
forward I will be testing using both
DirectX 11 and DirectX 12 the FX 83-70
finds itself playing the role of a back
marker in f1 2016 here was 29% sold in
the 2500 K when comparing the minimum
frame rate and 27% slower for the
average bumping the resolution up to
1440p doesn't
to help so I cry primal isn't
particularly CPU demanding though for
some reason AMD has issues with it
anyway this time the 2500 K was 19%
faster for the minimum and 24% faster
for the average much the same as seen at
1440p the FX 83-70 is again swept aside
this time when testing Grand Theft Auto
5 as the 2500 K was 33% faster when
comparing the average frame rate that
said the FX processor was just 8% slow
and comparing the minimum again we see
the margin slightly widened at 1440p
which is most unusual
here the FX 83-70 is now 14 percent
slower when comparing the minimum frame
rate even in hitman the FX 83-70 falls
well behind dipping down to 44 FPS from
a 3 run average this then made the 2500
K just over 40% faster when comparing
the minimum frame rate moving to 1440p
we see a rather large drop in the
minimum frame rate and now the 2500 K is
just 10% faster though admittedly that's
a decent margin right there
mafia tree is a very interesting title
and I think you might start to see more
reviewers picking this game up and
adding it to their list of games that
they test with the game was bashed for
it's horrible optimization and
rightfully so today it's still pretty
average in terms of performance but for
some reason AMD CPUs love it we saw the
1800 X beat out the 7700 K in this title
and now we see the FX 83-70 outpacing
the 2500 K for a rare victory when
comparing the minimum frame rate the FX
processor was 5% faster that margin is
extended out to 10% at 1440p though the
average frame rates are quite similar
Mirror's Edge catalyst sees a 2500 K
jump back in front leading the FX
processor by a 26% margin when comparing
the average frame rate the minimum was
closer though the 2500 case still
enjoyed a 16% performance advantage here
moving to 1440p the margins close up as
they often do and now the 2500 K is just
6% faster when comparing the average
frame rate here we have yet another
bloodbath total war war Hamas is a 2500
K pull ahead by a 30% margin for both
the minimum and average frame rate at
1080p much the same as seen at 1440p and
again this was another game where a
Verizon had issues when using the dx12
API
although the 2500 K was pegged at 100%
utilization and watched
- the experience was actually less
jittery than the FX 83-70 although the
minimum frame rates are similar and
there is a bigger variance between the
minimum and average on the 2500 K I can
assure you the experience was better on
the Sandy Bridge CPU at 1440p singh's
look competitive but again the FX 83-70
suffered more performance issues in this
game added purely to satisfy you guys
that keep asking for it here is ARMA 3
the 2500 K was 30% faster when comparing
the minimum frame rate and 36% faster
for the average much the same was seen
at 1440p and again it was interesting to
see the pentium g 4560 was actually
faster though again this is a lightly
threaded game ok so now we have the big
one battlefield 1 now over a computer
base in their risin review which adored
t v-- referred to they showed the 2500 K
to be 29% slower than the FX 83-70 in
the multiplayer portion of the game
using DirectX 11 which I felt was pretty
shocking the figures you are seeing here
from the single-player portion which
from what I've seen delivers very
similar CPU utilization figures that's
what I will be looking at the
multiplayer portion of the game in a
moment though comparing numbers
accurately here is next to impossible
but what I found was pretty convincing
anyway so with the Titan XP in charge of
the rendering work both CPUs looked
quite good over 2500 K was 27% faster
for the average framerate and 43% faster
when comparing the minimum much the same
we seen at 1440p a clear win for the
2500 K here and once again I found the
experience was less jittery on the Intel
CPU so as I just mentioned earlier I
have shown in the past the CPU
utilization looks exactly the same in
the multiplayer portion of the game as
it does in our single player test still
many of you don't seem to buy that
despite the evidence provider so in an
effort to remove doubt I have included
multiplayer performance as well what
you're seeing here is footage from the
conquest mode on the map giant shadow
and both the AMD and Intel processors
were tested in fully populated servers
in this little snippet of footage I
unfortunately wasn't able to follow the
exact same path as guys kept killing me
they didn't seem to care that I was just
here for benchmarking anyway as you can
see here the FX 83-70 is clearly well
down on the 20
500k despite the Sandy Bridge processor
operating at 100% capacity I should also
note that it is still smoother on the
Intel processor and there was less input
lag here we have a bit more of a direct
comparison again although the 2500 K is
locked at 100% utilization it didn't
suffer any noticeable frame drops in
fact I was very impressed by how smooth
the experience was
although slower the FX 83-70 wasn't bad
either having 16 gigabytes of system
memory is very beneficial in this title
anyway in a fully populated multiplayer
game we see that the 2500 K is around
30% faster I have no idea where you
would have to test in battlefield 1 to
see the FX processor winning by a 30%
margin on a final note some reviewers
claimed to benchmark the multiplayer
portion of the game by loading into an
empty map well that's fine for testing
GPU performance but using this method to
test CPU performance isn't ideal as the
CPU load is much lighter in fact even in
a multiplayer game full of 64 players if
you happen to wander off into a remote
section of the map you will notice the
CPU load drop away and the frame rates
will come up as a result and we did see
the FX 83-70 producing considerably
better performance when doing this
claims that the 8 core FX series had
played serious catch up were seriously
overrated as far as I can tell little
has changed into the initial release
back in 2012 Intel's quad-core 2500 K is
still manhandling the power-hungry FX
8000 series before wrapping things up in
what's going to be a bit of a lengthy
wrap-up here is a look at the average
performance from the 16 games tested
this sums it up quite well of the 16
games tested many of which were modern
titles the FX 83-70 was on average 20%
slower to the 2500 K not 10% faster even
when comparing the minimum frame rate
the FX processor was still on average 12
percent slower in fact no minimum frame
rate was comparable to the dual core
Pentium G 4560 fairly strong showing for
the FX 83-70 was seen in mafia 3 though
it didn't exactly annihilate the 2500 K
here if every game was as long piers
mafia 3 then yes the FX 83-70 would
indeed be 10% faster than the 2500 K but
result is somewhat of an outlier when
looking at battlefield one multiplayer
performance I did refer to computer base
I was able to replicate their week 2500
K performance in this title
another test play around that should be
fairly easy compared to my own data is
f1 2006 and canned benchmark though
their actual frame rates were
inexplicably lower anyway I found the
2500 K to be 27% faster so at least we
agree that in this game standing bridge
does provide much stronger performance
looking around the internet I also found
an interesting article from legit
reviews titled AMD FX 95 98 core CPU
review last look before
Rison this was a cool article worth
checking out unfortunately it wasn't
heavily focused on gaming so just thief
grand theft auto 5 and Deus Ex mankind
Nevada were tested and the 2500 K was
omitted from the results still the core
i3 73 50k was included and in mankind
divided it was 42% faster than the FX 83
70 which is in line with my own findings
in the end there's a very good reason
why the FX series has avoided like the
plague on the second-hand market you
don't see too many YouTube channels
dedicated to creating cheap used build
guides recommending their viewers race
out and find a cheap AMD FX system and
in 2017 this isn't going to change in my
opinion reviewers really nailed the FX
8350 s gaming performance way back in
2012 and as far as I can tell nothing
has changed
going forward I will continue to test
CPU gaming performance at 1080p using
the fastest crap is cut available at the
time of testing if you don't think this
is how CPU gaming performance should be
tested then the best course of action
would be to unsubscribe from the
hardware unbox channel and subscribe to
a channel that does the kind of testing
you deem acceptable the alternative
seems to be spamming links on YouTube
channels and this isn't exactly an
effective strategy the spam filter
automatically grabs them so Samuel no
need to keep spamming those links mate
circling back to Rison and it's gaming
performance it makes sense to me at
least that we keep testing gaming
performance the way we always have
this shows the consumer exactly what
they're buying into now and gives them
solid information to make an informed
buying decision once the factoring you
can discuss thoughts and even speculate
as to how things might play out in the
future just
I did in my review while I was wrapping
this video up over the weekend though
guys at PC perspective published a very
interesting article that claims that
updating the Windows 10 scheduler won't
be a silver bullet for Eisen it's a very
in-depth article that's well worth the
read those guys really know what they're
on about they started off by showing
that Windows 10 is indeed identifying
caused and attempting to balance
workloads the next part of their article
though was what interests me the most
they moved on to ping cores to confirm
their initial findings and in doing so
uncovered something very interesting
using the core i7 59 60 X they found
that it took roughly seventy six and
nanoseconds for the ping to travel from
one physical core to another a ping
within the physical core took just 14
nanoseconds here they were pinging the
hyper threading thread
anyway what's important to note here is
that the haswell-e architecture has a
latency of roughly 76 nanoseconds
between physical cause moving to the
risin seven 1,800 ex this is where
things got interesting because Rison has
split into two cc axes each with 4
physical cores things work a bit
differently working within a single CCX
they found a 26 nanosecond delay between
pinging within physical cores
that's slower than Intel but nothing
extreme however pinging adjacent calls
within the same CCX was very fast taking
just 42 nanoseconds or there abouts
the issue appears to be when moving from
one cc X to another doing so added
another hundred nanoseconds to the time
taking a total of around 140 nanoseconds
to complete the ping they found on
average it took 87 percent longer to
ping between CC X's on Rison than it
does to ping between physical cores on
the haswell-e 59 60 X they believe this
is what's responsible for the
weaker-than-expected gaming performance
they explain why this is in their
article so I won't go over that and
regurgitate the entire thing I will
provide a link in the video description
so if you are interested please go check
it out it's good stuff having said all
that though Rison obviously isn't a poor
gaming solution I'm yet to play a single
game where these new AMD processes are
anything less than silky smooth I
personally would purchase the 1,700 over
the 7700 okay because I'm not gaming on
a high refresh rate monitor and I focus
more on content creation although I
would pick the horizon 717
hundred over the 7700 K please be aware
that for the most part we're looking
strictly at gaming performance the 7700
K is a superior performer and anyone
publishing results or suggests otherwise
is trying to mislead consumers the only
game I have found so far where the
rising CPU has come out on top is mafia
3 whether or not this is an indicator of
future gaming performance is yet to be
seen
anyway I hope this clears things up for
my subscribers I really wanted to
explain to you guys why it is that I
believe testing CPU gaming performance
without a GPU bottleneck is very
important and I also hope you enjoyed
the FX 83-70 versus Core i5 2500 Kay
battle it was a pretty interesting
revisit if you did enjoy it too consider
hitting the like button that'd be cool
I'm your host Eve see you next time
