video a big thank you to our sponsors
for making this year's Computex coverage
possible
check out courses fancy new RGB memory
and for a limited time purchase any
select MSI Intel based motherboard or
gaming desktop and get a free game pack
worth up to $180 with titles such as
Warhammer vermintide 2 or X morph on
offer
you can't go wrong check the link in the
video description to learn more welcome
back to harbor unboxed today we're in a
park not on the showroom floor walking
around with all the hustle and bustle
there we're just in a park taking it
easy
actually it's not quite true I am on my
way to the Grand Hyatt we're gonna go up
to the 25th floor to the Corsair suite
to see what products they have on show
for us this year I've heard there's some
pretty cool RGB memory so definitely
want to check that out we all love a bit
of good RGB memory and of course there
are some cool cases as always I want to
see the 1000 d it has a really cool
custom liquid cooling loop in it and get
a few ideas for mine so anyway let's go
do that alright so I made it up to the
Corsair Suite and they actually let
means that was great and my first stop
was indeed at the Corsair 1000 D because
well just look at this build it really
is simply amazing inside there were a
heap of alpha cool bits the two large
reservoirs looked really impressive
along with those two truly massive front
mounted radiators like the 1000 D build
that I'm working on this rig used course
as ML series fans exclusively and in
total there were 25 of them so airflow
certainly isn't an issue here
nestled amongst all this glorious
harbour it has to be said course as new
Vengeance RGB Pro Series memory really
stood out and complemented the build
nicely I know this is highly subjective
but I personally feel like this is now
the best looking RGB memory out there
Corsair has managed to include 10
programmable LEDs per module which are
diffused by a translucent strip that
runs from end to end
there's also small cutouts in these
sides of the heat spreaders and these
light up quite nicely and really add to
the effect giving the user full control
over the 10 embedded LEDs is the new IQ
software Corsair deed launched a few
beta versions of a
unified IQ software a few months ago now
but at Computex
2018 they did finally strip the IQ
software of its beta status and is now
officially releasing the software
included in the software for the
Vengeance RGB Pro memory a dozens of
preset so I spent quite a bit of time
playing around with them you can even
program individual modules which is a
nice touch and apply a completely
different effect this would be pretty
awesome for those X 299 and X 399 builds
when loaded up with eight modules
additionally supported keyboards mice IO
coolers power supplies fans and and
other RGB accessories can be controlled
through the IQ software
this means synchronizing of lighting
across an entire system as possible as
long as you are using supported hardware
that said though should you already have
gigabytes RGB fusion or MSI's mystic
light software installed for example
then the utilities supplied by the
motherboard makers can be used to adjust
the lighting on the vengence RGB pro
memory this is a nice offering by a
Corsair and it prevents the need for
unnecessary software for just a single
product however if you do have multiple
products that are supported by IQ you're
certainly going to want to use that
instead for those of you that aren't
into bright lights never fear it's not
all about the bling also hasn't
overlooked performance the Vengeance RGB
Pro Series supports XMP 2.0 for easy
overclocking by loading optimized
timings at the click of a button of
course it also says they'll be offering
up to ddr4 4600 as well and they've been
able to successfully overclock that
particular memory to 4,700 mega
transfers so ddr4 4700 they said that
this is possible thanks to a finely
tuned PCB and carefully selected ICS
so great to see some fancy looking RGB
memory that can also support extreme
overclocks
as for availability the Vengeance RGB
primer II will be available sometime in
June 2018 in either black or white
while the IQ software is freely
available for download right now also on
display were two new cases the obsidian
508 RGB SE and crystal series 280x RGB
em ATX case the obsidian 500 D RGB se
features smoky tempered glass and the
three ll 120 RGB fans in the front
this apart from the standard obsidian
500d that we reviewed earlier in the
year the case is available now directly
from corsair with a suggested price of
$250 US but it will be available from
authorized distributors shortly then we
have the compact crystal series - ATX
RGB which comes pre-loaded with two LR
120 RGB intake fans connected to a
lightning node pro controller this is a
unique dual chamber case designed to
maximize airflow for all the critical
components while also providing a
convenient area to dump all the mess for
those lazy system builders I know I can
certainly appreciate that the dual
chamber design also allows the case to
offer a substantial array of storage
with room for two three and a half inch
drives and three two and a half inch
drive so a small form-factor needn't
mean small capacity the crystal series -
ATX RGB offers the choice between black
and white finishes and those not
particularly fond of RGB can also keep a
low profile with the standard version
Corsair sees these models will be
available immediately for $160 u.s. and
110 dollars u.s. respectively although
the two ATX supports standard ATX power
supplies Corsa has released a few new
great-looking sfx power supplies the new
SF series packs an 80 plus premium
certification and come in a 450 watt or
600 watt capacity these new models are
rated at 94% efficiency and a maximum
load and are advertised to use 105
degree rated Japanese capacitors they
also feature a fully modular design
using new individually slave cables and
include an SF x2 ATX mounting bracket
they're expected to launch in July but
we weren't given any pricing info there
were plenty of other corsair products on
display that most of them you're likely
already familiar with one product i did
check out that I hadn't seen previously
at least not in person was the k63
wireless gaming lap for designed for the
k63 Wireless Keyboard
this is basically a second-generation
lap dog and while I did actually minder
the original lap dog
it was quite heavily criticized and
while the lap board is significantly
better in pretty much every way the K 63
keyboard is also a fantastic product in
its own right and I'm gonna hand Corsair
for a few of them for my test systems
Wireless mechanical
for the win and just lastly I did check
out the HS 70 headset I tried on both
the white and special edition models I
only wore them for a few minutes but
they seemed very comfortable and they
did sound fantastic I'll be sure to test
these out in a bit more depth in an
upcoming unboxing boxes video well we've
started this video in the park so I
thought why not come back to the park to
end it
it is raining I don't know if you can
see on the camera but whatever we're
still going to do this outro in the park
I've got some some course airbags got a
few goodies in here for Tim and I so Tim
wasn't able to join me on this one but
I'll take that back to him anyway
I really hope you guys enjoyed the
corsair sweet some cool products on show
this year for sure i am getting very wet
now so I better wrap this up but I hope
you enjoyed the RGB memory and we'll
have more videos coming to you real soon
I have to run right now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
