I use the Synology to station ds1 five
one five which I unboxed the channel
midway through last year supporting five
drives out of the box and an Annapurna
labs quad-core processor the ds1 five
one five offers plenty of storage
options and enough horsepower to handle
my needs essentially I use the ds1 five
one five is a basic network attached
storage device this is all I require for
backup purposes despite the fact that it
meets my demands perfectly it also seems
like the deer's from five one five many
talents are actually being wasted
through the use of the do station
manager software it's possible phenology
storage devices do so much more than
just store data today with helping UDS
seven one six plus we're going to
explore a good number of these features
before I fire up the latest DSM software
let's just quickly go over the device
itself compared to the DES one five one
five the smaller tube a model is a bit
cheaper four hundred and fifty dollars
I will admit this still seems like a lot
that said inside you'll find an Intel
Celeron and 3150 quad-core clock to 1.6
gigahertz with a burst speed of two
gigahertz this powerful system on chip
is supported by two gigabytes of ddr3
memory which does seem a bit limited
especially given how cheap a ddr3l
4 gigabyte module is these days some
cool features include the ability to
support dx-5 1/3 expansion unit which
takes the drive capacity to 7 so it is
worth mentioning that the expansion it
costs more than the DF 7 1/6 plus itself
of $500 so yeah maybe not it's well
worth pointing out that along with the
aging ext4 filesystem the DF 7 1 6 plus
also features support for the more
modern and reliable btrfs otherwise
known as butter FS or better FS unit
itself is quite smart looking and comes
in an all-black design from the front
there are two hot swappable drive bays
with custom locks and then down the
right side we have a number of activity
lights that show the unit status and
network activities there's also a copy
button with a green LED which is used to
quickly access storage connected to the
front USB 3 ports finally you'll find a
small square power button which features
a nice blue
iled I should point out that the
brightness of the LED lights and the D
are seven one six plus can be adjusted
in the DSM software so if you find them
too illuminating you can turn them down
a notch
around the back the D S 7 1 6 plus is
cooled using a single 92 millimeter fan
which I found very quiet during
operation certainly much quieter than my
Western Digital red Pro 4 terabyte hard
drives also on the back side of the unit
we find dual gigabit ethernet ports two
USB 3 ports an eSATA port for the
optional DX five one three expansion
unit a factory reset button a four pin
DC power plug and the Kensington lock
now with the basics out of the way let's
take an in-depth look at the DSM 6
software from a home users perspective
and see why the DL 7 1 6 plus is much
more than just an ass also please note I
won't be focusing on performance for
this video starting with the basics we
have the file station program which is
essentially a Windows Explorer type
feature of DSM's browser-based user
interface file station allows users to
organize and share any and all of the
data stored on the NASS conveniently
it's possible to move and upload files
simply by dragging and dropping of
course you can still access shared
folders using windows explorer by
browsing the Synology nas on the network
this works for Mac users as well if
you're steaming that way the file
station is a great way to set
permissions to determine which folders
and files users can access another cool
feature which can be used by simply
right-clicking a file or folder and
selecting share file links allows you to
generate a link and QR code which can be
sent to friends or other users they can
then follow the link to download the
slack to file a folder whether or not
they possess a DSM account next we have
the photo station app which serves as a
centralized photo organizer for your
home network this is a particularly
useful feature for keen photographers
but also be enjoyed by a range of
shooters as well for storing and showing
off family photos for example the photo
station is a powerful app that allows
users to create albums that can be
viewed remotely and even create blogs to
record and share exciting photos
providing you have enough bandwidth
photo station can eliminate the need for
third party services such as Flickr it's
even possible to upload in download
photos from other devices to the photo
station using sinologist nifty little D
S photo app which features support for
both Android
and iOS complementing the photo station
is the knowledge ease audio station
which as the name suggests is designed
to organize your music collection
allowing you to create your own
playlists and assign ratings support for
internet radio as well as airplay and
Bluetooth devices also exists there's
also a DSO audio app which allows users
to stream music stored on the Nats to
smart devices using Android or iOS
additionally you can download music from
the nasty devices for offline playback
video station has seen a massive
overhaul on the latest DSM version now
looks prettier than ever this powerful
app allows users to store and organize
all their movies TV shows home videos TV
recordings in one place and not just
that the kind of course stream into a
multitude of devices including the
humble PC smartphones tablets or TVs it
can also retrieve video metadata from
the internet automatically saving you
the time to add movie posters and
descriptions yourself very cool indeed
users can stream videos to Apple TV
chromecast DLNA devices Samsung Smart TV
Xbox Playstation and more using video
station DS video or media server even if
your device or media player can't play
certain file formats there's a good
chance the video station can transcode
it on the fly to a watchable formatters
you stream it offline transcoding is now
supported as well this is a very cool
feature previously it wasn't possible to
use the transcoding feature offline as
this was a real time feature only
however Synology is now added offline
transcoding a feature that allows you to
pre transcode a video and then download
it to mobile devices via the DA's video
mobile app pretty amazing an app that I
do use on my dears 1/5 1/5 quite
regularly is download station this handy
app allows users to download files from
the internet through BitTorrent FTP HTTP
nzb
thunder flash get QQ dl and emule as
well as search for torrents directly via
the Synology search engine this means
users can now turn off their PC to save
power and let the much more
fuel-efficient Nass
handle the downloads and uploads 24/7
there's even a preview feature which
allows users to take a quick sneak peek
at the files are downloading before it
completes allowing them to stop
downloading any files that look a bit
yes of course like all the other
Synology at the download station smart
device friendly thanks to the DES
download app this mobile app allows
users to remotely start or manage tasks
search for a torrent and even start
downloading before you get home just
remember don't drive and torrent at the
same time if you need to take a note or
notes never fear
note station is here this isn't a
particularly useful app for home users
but I can see how small businesses would
find it useful one might assume that
note-taking is a pretty simple task even
Synology couldn't create what could be
described as a powerful note-taking out
nevertheless that possible they've done
just that with note station this app
allows users to create manage and share
content rich notes using an intuitive
interface and surprisingly rich editing
tools sinology says centralizing all
your Diaries class notes clippings
travel itineraries and so on makes it
easier to find what you need thanks to a
simple search feature even something
that's in an attachment they also point
out that keeping notes on a private
cloud gives you maximum data security so
no more funny stickman post-it notes
then I guess anyway enough about notes
let's look at something even more nerdy
yet spreadsheets just fun a spreadsheet
station sound Synology disappointingly
went with just spreadsheets as the app
name I know aside from the obvious
spreadsheets allows users to work on
data sets together much like Google Docs
the users can enjoy the benefit of
collaboration without worrying about
putting their data in public clouds
speaking of cloud services such as
Google Drive Synology allows users to
create their very own cloud service with
none other than yep you guessed it cloud
stations this app allows users to create
their own Dropbox and retain total
control as soon as you save a change it
automatically updates the copies and
your other devices computers smartphones
tablets etc this allows you to close a
document on the office computer and
immediately pick up where you left off
on your laptop during a business trip or
commute home the Synology DiskStation da
7 1 6 plus is an awesome
network-attached storage device with its
vast functionality should really be
considered a server rather than ass so
knowledge is DSM software is able to
take care of pretty much anything make
it an incredibly powerful device I could
go on and on about how great
dear 7 1 6 pluses as a file server slash
home server but rather than drag out
which is probably already a long video
by this point let's just get to it
the only possible issues I can think of
is the limited memory capacity along
with the lack of display options
competing models from QNAP who's been
carrying HDMI outputs for some time now
making them direct replacements for the
popular home theater PC thankfully it is
possible to upgrade the memory and many
users have reported successfully
upgrading the DF 7 1 6 plus to an 8
gigabyte capacity it would be nice if
Synology again look to that competitor
QNAP and offer various memory options
the keynote ts2 5 1 + for example can be
purchased with either 2 gigabyte or a
gigabytes of memory it also comes with a
remote control and HDMI output for 340
dollars or $450 for the 8 gigabyte model
meanwhile DDS 7 1 6 + starts of 450
dollars and although it only comes with
2 gigabytes of memory its superior
processor and arguably better software
still make it a very competitive option
at this price additionally it can also
be expanded using the DX 5 1-3 to
support another 5 hard drives which
could be a handy feature down the track
overall I've really enjoyed using the
DiskStation D 7 1 6 plus and have no
trouble recommending it at all be sure
to let me know what you think about the
DL 7 1 6 + would you miss features such
as HDMI out and easily upgradable memory
