episode of unboxing boxes this episode
set to be just as crazy as the previous
on hand we have many boxes which
presumably have more boxes inside and as
you would have guessed it we're unboxing
them so to prove that what I just said
is indeed true let's open up one of
these suckers to reveal the glorious
tech within I think this rectangular box
is probably a good starting point or as
good as any starting point that we have
here it's long and rectangular there is
well it's probably from Logitech if the
what the name on the box is anything to
go by give a give away but i'll use my
trusty little multi-tool here and we'll
work out exactly what's inside right
okay so what we have here looks to be
some familiar faces i think both these
products have already been reviewed on
the channel so maybe a shipping error oh
well we'll take a look anyway and see
what's going on here so we've got the
orion spectrum which is the RGB version
of the g 9 10 and we have already
reviewed on the channel so maybe
Logitech's you're sending one for me to
use because i know matt has been using
this sort of on and off as his daily
driver II can't work out whether it
likes the feel of the keys or not but
I've used the Roma jeez a bit I don't
mind them either but I'm not enough I've
made up my mind whether I like them or
not they're definitely mushiya sort of
feeling to the cherries I really like
like Matt I like the blue cherry MX keys
the tactile feel of those they are quite
loud but I you just they're one of those
things are just satisfying they use I
find but anyway still very good keyboard
and I will have a play with that
although we have reviewed it
and ok ah i didn't even know these
existed although they're obviously very
new we have reviewed these on a channel
and they are very good except what we
have here is the white or rather snow
edition of the G 933 animus spectrums ok
again this is another product that Matt
actually uses he uses these as he's
daily drivers full-time here I think
Bonnie's editing rig that we uses the H
fives or h7s from and creative but on
his gaming rig I believe he's using
these at the moment he has been since he
reviewed them he loves them and the
freedom of wireless is obviously great
but these were addressed to me so I
think I will be keeping these to use on
my gaming machine which is actually
Matt's going machine that moment i'm
using the p3 thermaltake water-cooled
thing we were having some problems with
that not not to do with the water
cooling it's all working fine but yet
another problem that I'll probably
hopefully have the part to fix in the
next episode of unboxing boxes next week
so and i'll probably go into that in a
bit more detail then and we'll install
safely and fix the problem that i
haven't told you what it is yet we'll
keep that as a surprise but anyway we've
got these i might since i'm not going to
be doing a review on them since we've
already reviewed them I'll take them out
and have a look because it is the new
snow edition apparently and they're
white so let's have a look at them
Oh mmm very nice that's cool very cool
very nice indeed okay so they got the
USB cable to charge them up standard 3.5
mm audio jack to a pair of RCA's and a
well you got your inline remote their
extension lead few other things so
that's all good game with passion game
with science hahaha cool I actually
think I prefer the look of the light
ones to the black ones I don't know if
you had a black and white build these
would be very very cool to have so we
got if you guys have seen a review of
these before or have them then you'll be
familiar with everything because nothing
I believe it's been changed apart from
the color still got those nice magnetic
side covers which have the same design
as far as I can tell the foldaway fold
down Mike look exactly the same I'll
probably throw in some b-roll here so
you guys can get a closer better look
but i have to say they are very cool
very cool indeed and we should have the
battery in that side probably not wise
to fire these up without charging them
first but what the hell there we go they
do they do light up I don't know how
well you guys can see that with the
bright light shining on them very
comfortable
I can see why Matt likes using these I
don't even have the Linus problem ah
maybe I do yeah they're pretty good
they're not going to fall off easily but
if you throw your head back they're
going for a ride well that's sorted to
be expected actually I'm i think Linus
was the only one that they did stay on
his head I think it was Luca they kept
coming off but anyway Matt didn't have
that problem they stuck on his head well
and they seemed pretty good online so
anyway very cool love the look of the
white ones hopefully I've got some good
b-roll it gave you a good look of at
them and this will probably be an excuse
to play some battlefield one or
something later on today might see how
Matt's going if he's keen to play some
games anyway I'll put them away for now
we'll move on the keyboard all right
next up what shall we look at I think
we'll get this out of the way this big
box this black shrink wrap wrapped box
looks suspiciously like a case it is
very well wrapped but we'll get it off
and we'll find out what lurks inside I
think that's enough cutting ah this is
something I ordered and I have to say I
really appreciate the retailer taking
the time to shrink wrap this to our
respect the unboxing boxes protests and
concealing the cases identity I know
that the suspense was killing you guys
on this one so I'm glad they played
along but as you can see now it is the
precision PS 09 and it's a great little
micro ATX this case I like get it out of
the box and give you guys a better look
at it
alright please don't static shock me
that we're good it's very like this case
but he's a micro-atx k almost almost
weightless for its eyes right so the PS
09 isn't a case I got Ian for review
this is something i purchased for a
friend a build I'm doing for a friend
anyway and the reason we got this case
was because apart from being cheap it is
a really nice understated case it's
clean elegant looking design and they
didn't want a crazy game in case that
have machine guns and rocket launches
and ammo crates all over it and big
bulletproof windows so they just wanted
something that I looked like maybe in
adult owns of course that's not to say
that machine gun covered cases aren't
cool and big windows we do have at their
time in place and we do love them at
Harbor unbox but for this particular
build wasn't going uh wasn't going to be
suitable so that's what we have this
thing some of the highlights of this
case some of the nice features are it's
basically designed to be an affordable
sort of sound proof or at least sound
deadening sort of case and that's why
you get these foam door panels which is
quite a nice feature at the price point
which I should mention the price it's
only 45 ozzy dollars this case which is
pretty I mean you don't get a power
supply in that package but usually you
only get pretty crappy power supplies
with cheap cases that include them so
you are free to put in whatever power
supply you want they get another nice
foam padded door which will absorb any
fan noises and whirring noises coming
from the case all the motherboard
standoffs cruise thumb screws but a
whole lot they're all black so you're
bout a little bit of match the design
you might have any shiny screw standing
out and as you can see it's all black
inside so although there isn't a window
to show it off you should be able to
create a pretty neat
cool-looking build in this little case
something else that's really really cool
you'll notice we've got the USB three
front header and a lot of the budget
cases still have you know predominantly
USB 2 with like one USB 3 connector
which I get the point 0 since it's
backwards compatible but you get the 2
USB 3 g's on this case that's a lot
better i think the in win cases week had
two USB 2 in 1 USB 3 really not the
point of that is because you can even
get adapters at this end that go from
USB 3 2 USB to any way to turn them into
USB 2 is if your motherboard doesn't
support USB 3 which some budget boards
don't that I mean going forward it's
becoming less and less common so I think
that's a cool feature in this case more
cool features are but a huge you know
motherboard backplate cut out here for
installing aftermarket CPU coolers and
stuff without having to remove the
motherboard so that's that's a very cool
handy feature which although becoming it
is becoming standard it's not always in
found in real cheap budget cases and
I've even found especially in smaller
micro ATX cases the cutouts quite small
because they usually use thin flimsy
materials and they don't want the whole
motherboard tray flopping all over the
place and it's not always compatible so
your motherboard might have the CPU
socket offset slightly which might be in
a slightly unusual position and then you
can't properly get the backplate in but
we've got a nice big cut out here which
is definitely going to suit all micro
ATX motherboards no doubt about it as
far as cooling goes it does come with
one front mounted 120-millimeter fanuc
pre-installed looks like you can install
another 80 millimeter fan and it looks
like in the back here probably an 80 or
90 millimeter fan as well definitely not
120 another cool feature often micro ATX
cases being that they are quite small
are limited to how much length you can
get with your graphics card in there but
because they've moved the three and a
half inch drive bay sort of up and you
would have your expansion cards down
here and if you can see basically you
have the full length of the case for
your graphics card so that means you can
have up to about 14 inch Rapids car
which is three hundred eighty
millimeters or something like that
basically you can fit a Titan XP in
there no dramas I don't imagine you'll
do that but you could and yeah as I said
it's a very light case it's only three
point three kilos or thereabouts-- but
extremely light obviously the doors
aren't on but they weigh virtually
nothing as well it is all steel but it's
quite thin but it's not too thin that it
see a flimsy it's quite stiff and
they've done plenty of folds as well to
strengthen anywhere that they've cut out
and then the front panel is the only
plastic part of the case but they say
it's high-strength plastic I know it
looks kind of cool it's been given like
a brushed sort of aluminium looking
texture finish same with the five and a
quarter inch drive bay covers so that's
nice and then on the side you've got the
power button tucked away there another
cool feature of the case is the dust
filters are there not that easy to get
out these ones or at least they're not
on this angle I need some nails but they
are removable dust filters in the side
here so if you had a little flathead
screwdriver or something like that you
can whip them out and when you get
clogged up with dust take them out give
them a blast out put them both back in
that should help you keep the dust out
there on both sides of the case so
that's cool might pop this off to have a
look behind here you see what what's
hiding okay I'll the dust filters just
fall out if you take the front panel off
so that's a quick way to get both of
them out I suppose if you don't have any
tools there's your 120 millimeter front
intake fan which draws air in through
the side of the front panel through
these so again it is filtered so you
shouldn't be sucking too much dust and
stuff in there yeah very simple but a
cheap case cheap back good build quality
which is something I should emphasize
why must I do these things on awkward
angles all the time
right all back together so again a
awesome battle UK so $45 Ozzy it's
really good and for the American viewers
it's about forty dollars us I think so
similar cost there between the Ozzy's
and the Americans and just to be clear
we didn't get this as a review sample
this is genuinely a product I would buy
for myself which I have done it's going
to a friend so yeah it's a case that i
think is genuinely good value good build
quality good value for money good value
i say that it's good value alright let's
put this one away and move on we will
switch back to the boxes on my right or
box probably the heaviest one we've had
so far does that mean there'll be
something good inside got a lot of tape
on it not sure if that's an indicator of
anything oh okay it's a box with in a
heavily tape wrapped oh I can't even get
this out hang on flip it up Wow well
whoever sent this obviously thought
that's quite valuable I'm worried about
getting damaged I want to be careful how
I cut into this
oh boy I think we've gone and done it
again we have here what is looks to be
mostly a keyboard unboxing I believe
what we have here is two keyboards we
won't be reviewing these on the channel
z77 I think this is the same brand that
made the cheap 35 or 30 ish dollar
mechanical cable that Matt reviewed a
while ago and we've since bought another
one to see how the quality of that was
and it seems fine in fact it was
actually slightly better than the review
sample which is odd we bought that a
month or two after the review and we've
picked up another two but these the full
size version I think it's hopefully
there's a black and a white one yeah
don't read Chinese so we'll have to just
open them up and find out what the hell
we've actually got here but we want to
do another article because we've been so
happy with the $35 key but it's amazing
like I mean doesn't look particularly
nice but the most important thing is it
feels good it's great to type on
accuracies very good feels very good it
actually sounds quite good as well very
similar to the best buy column green
switches but this very identical very
similar i should say to the cherry MX
blues and no problems yet so I mean you
sort of paying well I think they work at
to be about 40 50 Ozzy dollars and
you're paying to three times that for a
similar sort of keyboard with cherry MX
is so great value keyboards and yeah I'm
not entirely sure we've got here okay oh
wow this one this looks a lot nicer I
know what this is worth actually
but this looks significantly nicer than
the one that got which I might have
laying around here somewhere because I
think he's using the newer one at times
well okay and this is pretty cool I
might go and find out what this is
retailing for because this is this is
very nice this is obviously the white or
at least white silver version similar
font on the key caps but I don't think
it's quite as ugly as the other one I
don't know if it's individually like
each row has a different color light
hopefully not because that was one of
the things we really didn't like about
the original one that we reviewed just
got a new battery course not why would
it okay so this is an RGB keyboard which
is very cool and it even comes with some
replacement switches so that's very cool
those little tool in there to replace
them so it looks like you've got half a
dozen switches or thereabouts-- five
switches five spare switches that's a
very cool plastica palmrest clips on
think a bit of forces required out here
yep so that is pretty cool it isn't
thirty dollars though I'll just break
the bad news to you guys it looks like
it's like hundred dollars 90 90 to 100
dollars on amazon so yeah still a cool
keyboard got some nice features the RGB
lighting is cool and it looks like you
can change that around to light up
different sections of the keyboard a bit
differently with different colors well
I'm take a quick look at the other model
see if that's any different
it's the Falcons at 77 which is what
that one also is I suspect though this
is probably the black model yep it's
looking that way yep so the same same
keyboard same a key cap font and all
that same switches you get again five
spare switches and you also get a black
honeycomb sort of glossy looking wrist
rest which as we just found out you have
to force on quite well but it also
doesn't come off easily now it's
adjustable you got some height adjusting
legs if you want to change the angle of
attack got some cleaning up to do after
this episode get that off and I'll have
a quick look at the lighting on this one
as well but it'll be the same so yeah if
you can see it flashing cycling through
the colors now what you do is RGB and
there's some sure how well you can see
all the long camera with the bright
light aimed at it but yeah cool looking
keyboards they as far as we can tell the
quality of them is quite good but a
hundred dollars you sort of getting up
there towards the well-known brands
which is a bit of a shame was hoping
that based on around the 70 dalamar
which they could be i've only seen one
seller selling them i'm not sure if it's
actually the salad even sent these to us
so i'm not even sure what we paid for
them but anyway the last box we should
cherish this time together is fleeting
we have to wait a whole week before we
get to do this again but i think this is
a care package from g.skill i think
there's some pretty cool stuff in this
one they usually look after us so
we'll check it out this stuff 1 cent or
this is sponsored hardware this was sent
to support the channel with our testing
stock up our test systems all right
bubble wrap more bubble wrap okay so we
got one box it's very heavy out and how
much memory isn't that but it's heavy
yeah we got a little retail box we've
got looks like a jewel channel jewel
stick get there and that's it I think
that's probably plenty really alright
three boxes of memory all of which looks
to be ddr4 so let's check it all the way
up so we have some ddr for 3,000 memory
here Ripjaws v ddr4 memory in black they
look pretty cool and that is a 16 gig
get there what is that worth might as
well tell you guys while I'm here right
so this stuff is selling for a hundred
and thirteen dollars us so I think
that's pretty good really but it's good
looking memory should go well with again
a any sort of well black-themed
basically any build really but black and
red black and white anything like that I
would look we used the Trident z memory
in the p3 build but this would also look
cool in that build so basic sort of
memory but pretty cool this stuff we
we've got some of them some more of this
recently actually here we go we've got
another kid of this though this boxes a
bit thicker so what's the difference
this kit we picked up for the upcoming
build that's been up coming for a long
time we're waiting on one more component
for that it's a the GTX 1070 windfall
scarred from gigabyte just keeps getting
delayed and delayed but we're supposed
to be in that card this week so next
week we will have that build finally
anyway for that build we have a
16-gigabyte kit of ddr4 3200 memory so
to 8 gigabyte modules of the Tritons e
memory so that's pretty cool so that's
for that build but what we have today is
ddr4 3000 memory then this is for sticks
so I 32 gig kit for a gigabyte sticks so
we'll take a peek at that memory and the
transi again is the memory we used in
that core p3 build that we used the
black and white stuff and this is the
black and red with sort of a grayish
silver color on the other side this
memory has been getting around for a
while so you guys have probably seen it
but it's pretty cool looks pretty good
again if you've you know not not many
people do the red and black build of
course I don't know why they've gone
with this color scheme option for the
series but if you do happen to have a
red and black bills you know just by
chance then this might be the memory to
show it off so again there are four of
those modules for a 32 gig kit and they
will probably go into probably go into a
core i7 system for testing i think but
we'll see i'm not sure there's plans for
them certainly and then this one what do
we have here so this is 64 gigs of ddr4
3200 and it's this so same memories what
we just looked up at the 3200 and it's a
64 gig cute and this might be destined
for a broad well II bill so it looks
like we've got eight modules i think if
i had of read what it said in the box i
would have known that but yeah there's
there's eight modules so each with their
own little certified g.skill
thingamajigger
and again these will look familiar
because you just looked at them 20
seconds ago but yeah the same kit though
it is the 3200 s so this ended up being
the keyboard and memory edition though
we did have a case and a headset so that
helped break it up a little bit but
there you go a heap of cool ddr4 memory
we enter that with almost 120 gig 128
gigs worth of this stuff I think plus
the kit we already had so there you go a
lot of g.skill memory thanks to the guys
at g.skill for hooking us up that'll
make benchmarking a lot easier we'd have
to keep shuffling memory from one system
to the other so that should streamline
things a little bit for us but there we
go we got ddr4 memory a very good
looking headset which I'm very tempted
to go start playing some games now with
these oh they're so comfortable so we
got those we have a shiny new keyboard
yep so we got that and the case which is
now under a ton of boxes and packing
stuff so we'll leave that where it is I
probably should get cleaning up now so
that concludes another episode of
unboxing boxes hope you guys enjoyed
this one we had some pretty cool stuff
next week's episode will be a bit
different as I said we're going to be
pulling out the core p3 system and doing
a few upgrades repairs on that so yeah
that will definitely be interesting and
then this week what do we have on the
agenda for this week so we've gotten
through pretty much most of the GPU
comparisons I'll be doing an update to
that if you guys caught the GTX 1050 toi
versus the flagship card from 2012 the
gtx 680 are we doing a revision or
update to that video where we include
because he / you guys asked for it
raid on a radeon HD 7970 I think maybe
the gigahertz edition card I'm not sure
which is basically an r 9 to ATX but
i'll be adding that to the comparison
because a lot of you guys like they've
gimp the drivers that's why the GTX 10
60s is slow or slower than a 1050 two
hour which isn't really the truth but
you know a lot of guys like to believe
that so will be the confirming or
debunking that with the Radeon graphics
cards that should be pretty cool and
then the twelve hundred dollar 1440p
built in probably pushed back to next
week now and yeah I've been working on
another cool video which looks at the
impact of hyper threading on the core i7
processes namely we've been looking at
the 6700 k so we've been testing all the
sort of latest games with a seriously
high-end graphics card in the tight and
XP though I also tested with the GTX
1070 and 1062 see how the advantages or
gains from hyper threading scale down as
the GPU power becomes lesser and lesser
so that'll be another cool one and we've
tested with just over half a dozen of
the latest game so you've got like Gears
of War for civilization 6 I put C
skylines in there actually battlefield
one there's a few other games with that
the results there are actually really
quite surprising sort of maybe for some
of you but it's an interesting video and
I think that'll pretty much conclude the
videos for this week I think we have a a
pre-recorded a mouse review from Matt
which will probably stick up and that
will round out the week and then we'll
get back to unboxing boxes next week and
we'll do it all over again that we hates
more cool content so stay tuned and we
will see you next time bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
