time last year I set out to address a
question many of you are asking me at
the time should I buy The Horizon 5 1600
X or the non x 1600 now the 1600 was
selling for 250 dollars u.s. at the time
while the vanilla 1600 could be had for
12% less at 220 dollars u.s. the 1600
came clocked around 10 percent lower out
of the box but given that it is an
unlocked part overclocking was an option
and that meant pushing past 1600 X
performance was impossible the 1600 also
came with the impressive Wraith spire
box cooler though AMD did try and move
from Intel's playbook and sold the 1600
X without a cooler at all
in short the risin 5 1600 the 9x model
was a much better value option in my
opinion and looking back at that video
it seems like most of you agreed with me
this time around though AMD seems to
have learnt their lesson it seems only
Intel can get away with bending over the
enthusiasts and making them all excited
about not only having to buy their own
cooler but also delayed their chip so
the cool look and do its thing so
fast-forward to today and as I said
Ami's learnt from past mistakes this
time around the X models are much more
appealing
The Horizon 520 600 X might cost fifteen
percent more at two hundred and thirty
dollars u.s. but for that extra
investment you do get a bigger and
better box cooler better out of the box
performance thanks from up to eight
percent increase in clock speeds and a
possible bidding process which can lead
to better memory support as I see it
this time around both models make sense
and depending on your wants and needs
there are justifications for buying
either having now extensively tested
both models this is how I look at it if
for whatever reason you're not planning
on overclocking then the 2600 X is a
sensible option out of the box it's
around 7% faster and while the CPU
itself does cost fifteen percent more if
you simply factor in a cheat be 350
motherboard eight gigabytes of ddr4
memory then the bundle cost for the 2600
X does come out at just
eight percent more expensive so the cost
performance ratio is much the same
you just get a bit more oomph and a
better cooler so in that scenario I feel
like the extra thirty dollars u.s. is
well-spent
however if you plan on overclocking then
as was the case with the first
generalizing CPUs I feel like the 9x
models represent better value when
reviewing the arisin 526 hundred for
example I recently found that it
overclocked just as well as the X model
in fact for my particular chips the non
X model was slightly better when it came
to overclocking regardless our
overclocking Headroom should be very
similar on either model and this means
the $30.00 u.s. you say by buying the
non x version can go towards upgrading
the cooler first the twenty-six hundred
and twenty six hundred up grade the
cooler if you hope to achieve that
glorious 4.2 gigahertz overclock for
under $30 there are options such as the
deep core game X 300 for example or I
also like the arctic freezer 33 eSports
one but of course there are loads more
options to choose from
personally for 230 dollars u.s. I'd
rather have the risin 5 2600 plus the
Arctic freeze of 33 eSports one in combo
then the 2600 X with the Wraith spire
those willing to I overclocked will be
rewarded at 4.2 gigahertz the
overclocked 2600 was up to 8% fast in
the 2600 X it was also up to 11% faster
than the r5 1600 maxed out at 4
gigahertz if you're really on a budget
it is possible to push the 2600 to an
all-call frequency of 4 gigahertz using
the race stealth box cooler here it's
still faster than any 1,600 and likely a
better value option even taking recent
discounts and whatnot into consideration
finally if you've never overclocked
before then shame on you never been
seriously I recommend you give it a shot
it's very safe and extremely easy to do
with most of the motherboards out there
as long as you keep your voltages below
1.5 volts then you'll be fine there's
also loads of overclocking guides on
offer and typically you will be able to
find a guy that is tailored specifically
for your motherboard and that is going
to do it for this one if you enjoyed the
