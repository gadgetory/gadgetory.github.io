now didn't really plan on doing an
unboxing boxes episode this week
especially with the rise and testing
which you're no doubt aware of been a
few hiccups there I can't really go into
too much detail but basically I got my
processor and a motherboard the a seuss
version here Friday so I spent all
Friday night testing all day Saturday
Saturday night and Sunday Sunday night
didn't get a whole lot of sleep and part
of that was because it wasn't really
going to plan and again I can't say too
much but basically it wasn't that Zen's
bad or anything like that so don't freak
out just teething issues new CPU new
platform and I I'm hoping I was one of
the more unlucky reviewers because I
just ran into problem after problem
after problem and you know they a lot of
them were affecting performance anyway
we've sort of sorted all through them
now and I'm hoping part of what will
solve the issue for me will be in these
boxes a new motherboard because I just
can't sort out some of the problems on
their sous board I've got I don't need
two BIOS update I've updated it twice I
don't know if they're still something
they're working on but anyway can't go
into too much detail it's been a
nightmare bet we're getting on the right
track now so with that I should probably
start unboxing some boxes and once I've
done that quickly edit this uploader and
get back to benchmarking but this is
kind of a nice break doing something a
bit different than just sitting in the
computer running tests scratching my
head and trying to work out what's going
on alrighty we'll start with this little
what am i doing we'll start with this
little laser rocket box here looks like
it's masruk anyway and we will see what
they have for us in this little green
package just go here now the box is out
of the way unrelated to what we're doing
at the moment but we'll be
useful very soon in the last episode of
unboxing boxes last week I talked about
the pentium g 4560 build that I'm doing
in the Coolermaster case that got sent
last week but was the wrong case so
hopefully I've got the right case here
this week being a we'll get to that
shortly so this is a b250 pro 4 board
from asrock I was gonna go with a h1 10
board originally because they are a bit
cheaper but I thought since is a new
build and whatever I might as well try
it one of the be 250 boards since I
haven't actually done that yet one
hiccup though I may have to stick with
the h1 10 board actually because I think
the case is micro ATX only and this
board is full 80s I didn't actually get
this board for the build eggs that
wasn't it's only purpose but I thought
hey that might be cool to throw on there
but it's not gonna happen
unless I go with the cooler master case
that was sent last week it's getting
also confusing
I really don't have the energy for this
at the moment but yeah that's a pretty
cool looking board I'm not actually sure
how much it's worth
it wouldn't be hugely expensive so
anyway I won't spend too much time on
this because we have some am floorboards
to check out hopefully so I'll just put
that aside for now I'll have to find the
ad-rock h1 10 micro ATX board which I
will end up using in this tier which a
lot of you guys were really keen for me
to check out the master box light 3 and
it was sold out but cool Coolermaster
pulled some strings and got it in
gigabyte what are they got for me all
right this is what you guys are no doubt
here for so what do we have here the the
a be 350 gaming 3 hmm ok
I would be 3-game be 350 gaming 3 is
probably better anyway it doesn't matter
alright let's have a look
that's probably it looks like an RGB
cable couple of SATA cables quick
connector cable IO shield all right here
we go
pretty cool-looking budget board that's
for sure so we've got their amp up audio
it looks like a really nice audio
solution on this board some steel
reinforced primary and secondary PCIe x
16 slots a bit of cooling on the vrm
looks like a decent design there what do
we got around here okay a couple of USB
threes and nothing too fancy but that's
all you sort of expect the SATA ports
your bit all over the place so we've got
four down here another two up here so
not sure they're connected to there'd be
another controller probably but anyway
pretty cool looking but it looks like
we've got on there RGB lighting strips
down the side to sort of fancy it up a
bit not sure if there's any other RGB
lighting but yeah now for the big one
for um I believe this is again from
asrock and I'm hoping what I need for my
new a m4 system that I want to build
today is in here
indeed it is drum roll please x3
seventies gaming k4 and Oh a bit of a
bonus bonus round 370 Taichi what do we
have here oh yeah another process up
there's no cooler in the box so it's
very light but uh yeah we'll have a look
at that in a second okay so 2 X 370
boards and I think I'll use this one in
the build I used on I used the what is
at the crystal series 570 X the Corsair
tempered glass case for the KB Lake
build and I went with a sort of blue
black and white design for that and that
system looked awesome a lot of you guys
have no real
like it so I think for the horizon 7
build I'll use this board and go with a
black and red theme for that bill to
actually pretty play the black and Red's
pretty much whatever on uses but it's
kind of fitting for a horizon 7 build
even though the boxes gray and orange so
let's just have a quick look at these
boards I can't talk about performance or
specifications really well I definitely
can't talk about performance but I can
show you the board's off if I can get
them out you got the standard asrock
postcard people your family will love
receiving that when you go on a trip I
got a sticker on a CD IO shield some
SATA cables end up two screws and some
antennas anyway it's not for that let's
get to the board itself okay you know
that is a pretty cool-looking AMD
motherboard it's got all the bells and
whistles - there's purity sound for
which I'm sure is as good as the
implementation on the Intel board's
ultra m2 slot and a second m2 not marked
as ultra m2 but I'm sure it's still got
plenty of bandwidth for those high-speed
nvme drives pair of on-board USB 3.0
headers looks like we've got what is
that 10 SATA ports here diagnostic LED
display so that's very useful
unfortunately though their art looks
like there's mounts for them for power
and reset like easy to access power
reset buttons not hugely useful for
general users but on a test bed or
whatever they're super handy but anyway
not there on this one like the gigabyte
board we just saw off a steel-reinforced
primary and secondary PCI u x 16 slots
and what else a seriously beefy vrm on
this board very impressive looking don't
know the full specs yet I'm not going to
count them right now but anyway it looks
good nothing on the backplane black PCB
a really really cool looking motherboard
this one I'll be very interested to see
what the price is for this board because
yeah it looks really really nice and if
it can come in under these add 270
boards which I think it probably should
that be a nice pairing for a risin 7
processor talking of Verizon seven
processors let's have a look at what
we've got here so they've obviously been
using this for testing internally this
processor I didn't expect them to send
one along but thank you as rock and what
do we have here nice a 1700 X got a
sticker as well which is good because I
have the 1800 X already which I've been
using for testing I'll get some close-up
b-roll for you guys they'll leave that
in next if I bend a Pinole yeah let's
not think about that now put that safely
up there with that one so yeah I really
love that motherboard it's making me
think twice now I kind of want to put
that in the corsair case it looks cool
anyway before I make any decisions let's
have a look at what the gaming k4 looks
like because the the gaming hey brand is
usually pretty good as well alright so
this one's as cool as the Taichi okay
not a nice static bag I'd say this was
the board they were testing with okay
well this is an equally impressive
motherboard I have to say really nice
design the red heat sinks look cool so
again for that red and black build it's
going to look pretty awesome it has the
cinema 3 audio which is the creative
audio that's often found on the gaming
models but something interesting about
this board compared to the Taichi board
is the fact that we have oh okay yeah I
see what's going on here I thought that
was a pair of Ultra M twos up here and
another another M 2 here I thought
that's bizarre
nope I'm wrong there is an M 2 Wi-Fi
port there because this board doesn't
come yeah it's a Wi-Fi is optional
whereas the Thai she has
as standard so anyway you can add an M
to a Wi-Fi card if you want we also got
the ultra m2 and a standard m2 down here
it looks like they both take 80 ml long
cards modules yeah overall looks like a
fairly similar feature set there isn't a
third PCIe x 16 slot though it looks
like it's only wired for four times on
the tai chi board so I mean you're early
really gonna need the two anyway and
then possibly a one of these x 1 ports
for a sound card or something along
those lines
less SATA ports I'd say this is clearly
a cheaper board aimed at not entry level
gaming but certainly more entry level
than this board but anyway you've got
the led diagnostic displace that's good
still no quick power on reset buttons on
board but that's fine again the good
creative audio or at least creative
software support audio anyway it'll be
using an ALC audio codec no doubt the
vrm doesn't look quite as impressive but
still substantial not much going on on
the back of the board again that's to be
expected but yeah overall a cool looking
motherboard so now I've got to work out
which one's gonna go in this system I'm
going to build probably right now once
I'm done here
so yeah in summary these two are X 370
boards they both use the same flagship
chipset though it's just a chip but
anyway and now I've just got to work out
which one I want to use for my test
system I really like this board but I
kind of wanted since the Intel systems
blue I kind of wanted to make the AMD
test system red I know they're only test
systems but because I do show them on
camera if I wasn't doing the channel and
it was just for testing I wouldn't care
about because I do show the systems and
be cool to have a blue Intel and a red
AMD system I think that would be cool I
can probably chuck in these sitting
and these sitting around for ages
suffered through these Pro LED red
Corsair fans in and that would look
really cool so I might do that actually
got three of them got a bit of dust on
it I'll have to go fishing for the other
one and just quickly have a quick look
at this I believe it's the windowed
version of the master box light three
yeah I was surprised by how many of you
guys were really keen for me to use this
case I was planning on using it and
coolermaster ran out of stock didn't
tell me and just sent the master box
five and I was going to use that but
well it would have actually worked out
well with that be 250 board over because
that's an ATX board but I was planning
on using a mini ITX h100 board
originally which is I'll stick to that
plan and yeah I thought oh I'll just
swap but then when a happy you guys like
I really want you to use the master box
like three please use that test want to
check it out I think it'd be perfect to
build and it is cheaper sup makes sense
but yeah it was sold out anyway
coolermaster
pulled some strings and got one to me
very quickly so big thanks to them for
that and now I can finally show you guys
the case building it let you know I
think of it why why am i struggling to
get everything out of box
listen to me sulking about having a
benchmark horizon boohoo well it's very
nice and light what a cool little
compact case not quite sure that's
coming from but anyway magnetic dust
filter just hanging around on the roof
of the case I'm sure it's got an obvious
home once we get inside
don't have while you guys can see it it
must go on the outside
I assume should go there without looking
at the manual seems obvious to me know
what I was doing on top of the case but
anyway we've it's back in its home so
don't know how well you guys can see in
there but perfect sized case for what I
want to do it's also really cheap as
well I think it's only for $50 Aussie so
really nice quality case for that price
it's got a the top panel connectivity
pair USB 3.0 type-a ports you've got a
pair of 3.5 meal audio jacks power
button tiny reset button and a hard
drive activity light no doubt the power
button is backlit also probably in a
blue or something like that and then
around the back
it comes with a pre 120 millimeter fan
installed power supply goes on the top
but not really a big problem for a small
case it looks like we've got what one
two three four PCI or four expansion
slots if you wanted to try and squeeze
jewel GPUs in or something this is what
I plan to stick in there
just quickly I won't drag this out too
long it's a cute little h1 ten board
it's actually almost like a mini ITX
board but not quite and it will go in
there something like that look something
like that
check the G 4560 on their stock Intel
Box cooler and either something like the
gtx 1050 or the RX 470 one of those
pricing tiers and you've got yourself an
awesome new budget system that's very
very capable at 1080p and can even
dabble at 1440p but leave all
information for another day
right so wrapping this up so I can get
back on with testing horizon which I am
excited to do even though there have
been some hiccups along the way I
haven't lost my enthusiasm yeah we start
we got to check out two awesome X 370
boards and a cool be 350 board and a be
250 board it's a bit confusing isn't it
since there be 250 Intel be 350 AMD but
anyway whatever I'm rattling on to cool
X 370 boards now I have to sit here and
try and work out which one I'm going to
put in this build I'm sort of still
leaning towards this one but anyway I do
like this one though I'll work it out
and yet for those of you hanging for the
rise in testing which is coming up in a
few days as I'm sure you're aware I
won't be able to do the kind of in-depth
benchmark video that I would have liked
because I'm sort of I've gone from
having almost a full week to test to now
a day because then I've got to edit it
and do everything else so to be
disappointing but I do plan there'll be
four games tested in the day one review
along with some applications as well at
premiere and Excel and all that sort of
stuff so there'll be and I will be
testing against a huge amount of
processors so they'll be this the Sandy
Bridge 2500 K and 2600 K there'll be
some Ivy Bridge as well and then
there'll be some Broadway lis though I
don't know if I'll get my 6100 K today
I've that's another whole story the 6800
k will be there the haswell-e 5960 x
will be there then you've got the
skylake core i5 and core i7 like
processors and the k be like equivalent
which is essentially the same processor
faster at the box anyway they'll all be
included so they'll be plenty of
processors just not as many tests as I
would have wanted because I just don't
have time to do all the conductor all
the testing but we're looking at things
like thermals power consumption
overclocking and all that sort of good
stuff as well so it'll be more of a
general review and then I'm hoping by
Monday the next week I'll have a big 12
or 13 game comparison rise and taking on
the Intel stuff
so that'll actually be really
interesting it'll be a good gaming
benchmark and see how it slots in there
and also just finally before I get out
of here some exciting news for you guys
I will be doing a full horizon 7
giveaway complete box all the bits
inside and that'll be an international
giveaway worldwide giveaway and that
will be in partnership with Thermaltake
and msi so that's really cool those
companies have come together to help me
build an awesome system to give to you
guys it'll be a custom water-cooled hard
pipe system using a risin 7 processor
hopefully something like the 1800 X
obviously a really cool MSI motherboard
MSI graphics card then you know I think
we have that nice new tempered glass
thermal tape case again with the hard
pipe custom liquid cooling by yours
truly power supply and all that sort of
stuff so that's gonna be an amazing
system and yeah all of you guys can
enter to win that there'll be much more
details coming up probably next week on
that I'm going to build I'm going to
show you all the parts first then I'm
gonna do a video much like I do with the
format for the tower 900 and the Corp
III then I'm going to build the whole
system and show you the process and how
it comes together and then we'll
probably do some benchmarking and all
that and then there'll be a video that
explains how you can enter to win then
you guys just have to enter hopefully
you win and yeah that should be really
exciting really cool first time I've
done a full system giveaway on the
channel so looking forward to it and
yeah big thanks to Thermaltake and msi
for making that happen anyway that's all
for this one I hope you guys enjoyed my
sort of last minute hodge podge slap
together unboxing video but yeah it was
a bit of fun I enjoyed checking out the
new boards anyway guys I'm gonna get
back to benchmark or at least building
my system which I'll probably film and
show you guys I'm your host Steve I'll
catch you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
