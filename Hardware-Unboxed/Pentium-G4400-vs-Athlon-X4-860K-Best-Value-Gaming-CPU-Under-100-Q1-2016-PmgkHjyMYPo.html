looking at building a brand new gaming
read with the objective of spending as
little as possible
but still want to receive a decent level
of performance I've done a heap of
videos that look at which GPU delivers
the best bang for your buck but what
about budget processes the choice isn't
quite as simple as just picking AMD or
Intel both companies have a multitude of
options in the sub $100 category to make
things simple I'm going to quickly
eliminate a good number of them you
might have noticed that Intel still
pushing their Haswell processes out the
door but for a brand new build
I recommend avoiding these processes the
LGA 1150 platform is going out of
fashion fast moreover there's just one
standout processor in this price range
anyway is the fully unlocked pentium
Anniversary Edition g3 - 5 8 for $70
looking to intel's current sky pentium
lineup we find a g 4400 at $60 and a g40
$590 while the g 45 20 is pushing $100
few months ago I would have said don't
bother with these processes and instead
get the highly overclockable G 32:58 as
the ability to push this process over
four gigahertz makes it a much better
value proposition Intel's budget
skyleigh processors became considerably
more attractive once motherboard makers
such as asrock bio star and Super Micro
started developing support for non key
overclocking Super Micro has even gone
one step further an engineer's special H
170 overclocking motherboard which I'll
be reviewing shortly now the ability to
push the 3.3 gigahertz 4400 all the way
to 4.6 gigahertz it's become our new
favorite budget Intel processor on the
other side of the fence we find AMD and
their small army of extremely affordable
quad core processors most notably the FX
4350 at $90 and the athlon x4 860 k and
it almost impossible to refuse $75
supporting FM 2 plus motherboards
started a little over $40.00 but if you
want to go the full hog and get yourself
an A ATX motherboards expect to shell
out at least $60 at another $40 for an 8
gigabyte ddr3 memory kids and you have
yourself what looks to be a very capable
$175 combo meanwhile budget Intel
shoppers opting for the G 4400 we need
to spend $60 on the CPU
and around $100 on his dad 170
motherboard if they wish to overclock
the asrock z170a x1 can be hope for $95
add in another $45 for a ddr4 2400 a
gigabyte kit and the total bill comes to
205 dollars now I know it seems a little
bit crazy to spend so much more on the
motherboard than the processor but the
overclocking potential of this combo is
enormous still if you don't plan to
overclock then an H 110 motherboard will
drop the total price just 155 what I
want to know is how these two processes
compare in the latest games games such
as Just Cause 3 Rhema succeed Star Wars
Battlefront fallout 4 and more in an
effort to find out which is the best
value option for gamers I'll be testing
both the athlon x4 860 K and Pentium G
4400 at their standard clock speeds as
well as maximum overclocked frequency
since these are sub $100 CPUs I felt it
prudent to pair them with a realistic
graphics card for testing so not a tight
necks instead I'll be testing with to
GPU configurations one with the Radeon
r9 380 and another with the geforce gtx
960 both cost $200 or less using the gtx
960 we find that both the 860 K and G
4400 able to push the graphics card to
its limits before any overclocking takes
place
now if the I 9 380 we see that while
overclocking these processors makes
little difference the G 4400 offers a
slight performance advantage of the 8 PK
again we find that overclocking these
processors provides no additional
performance with the gtx 960 there's a g
4400 does again have a slight
performance advantage over the 8 X 2 K
moving to the i 9 380 providers with
similar results and again the G 4400 is
able to slightly edge our AMD's budget
quad-core the call of duty black ops 3
results are interesting though not
significant the G 4400 is able to max
out the gtx 960 it just 3.3 gigahertz or
the 860 KS we have up to 4 point 4
gigahertz and even then the minimum
frame rate is slightly lower now the
black ops 3 results with the r9 380 are
genuinely interesting for the simple
fact that the age 60 K gets hammered
when looking at the minimum frame rate
just to be sure I even should we'll
check these results it was noticeable
lag spikes when using the 860
even went overclocked and this wasn't
the case with the G's 4400 which
appeared very smooth this fallout four
test takes part when exiting the vault
and in this section of the game using
the gtx 960 both the g 40 486 TK deliver
acceptable frame rates though intel's
dual-core processor does have a small
performance advantage using the r9 380
the minimum frame rate takes a huge dive
on these budget processes and the 860
kevin struggles when looking at the
average frame rate which went over
clocks was just over 50 fps
meanwhile the overclocked G 4400 was
good for almost 70 FPS now as we move
into the city of Boston for some more
fallout for benchmarking we find very
different results
neither CPU allows for particularly
impressive performance when benchmarking
the gtx 960 the g 4400 is considerably
faster than the 860 k using the i9 380
you provided some very mixed results in
the fallout 4 boston test the stock g
4400 tanked with massive stuttering as a
drop down to 11 FPS overclocking the g
4400 seemed to cure this problem but
with a minimum frame rate of just 21 FPS
it wasn't exactly smooth gameplay the
860 K on the other hand played better
than a non overclock G 4400 but much
worse than the overclock G 4400 Just
Cause 3 is known to play rough with
low-end hardware but we were surprised
by how well it played on the lowly G
4400 and GTX 960 combo granted
performance wasn't stellar but with a
minimum frame rate of 37 FPS the game
was playable despite noticeable input
lag when driving the eight-six UK on the
other hand was noticeably laggy almost
all the time and I found driving
vehicles for example to be extremely
difficult
Just Cause 3 performance was a bit of a
mess with the r9 380 image processes not
even the heavily overclocked G 4400
delivered smooth performance Mad Max
caused few problems with the gtx 960 as
we found both the g 40 486 EK were able
to provide very playable performance the
i9 380 provided similar performance
trends in Mad Max with our budget AMD
and Intel processors here we see Rainbow
six siege plays just as well in the 860
K as it does on the G 4400 and with the
gtx 960 in use there's no need to
overclock
even with the r9 380 we find similar
results and although that 860 K it has
to
overclock to match the stock G 4400 it
was just 3 FPS in it and at over 70 FPS
for the minimum that isn't a significant
margin Star Wars Battlefront is another
game with 860 K and G 4400 deliver
similar performance in overclocking
these CPUs does innate performance with
the GTX 960 testing again with the r9
380 we find that the standard 860 K is
again slightly off the pace of the G
4400 but with just 2 to 3 frames in it
the margin isn't substantial the witcher
3 test takes place in the town of
novigrad the town known to Slade your
core processors yet despite that the G
4400 is found triumphant when using the
gtx 960 and by a rather large margin i
might add when comparing the minimum
frame rate swapping out the gtx 960 for
the i9 380 really mixes up the results
and here the stock g 4400 really
struggles dropping down to just 22 FPS
with an average of only 33 FPS making it
much slower than the 860 k however once
overclocked the g 4400 farms form and
returns to its winning ways with a
minimum of 39 FPS an average of 48 fps
if we take the average minimum frame
rate from the 10 games tested the
results aren't as expected at least
they're not what I was expecting
with the gtx 960 handling all the
rendering work the 860 case or an
average minimum of 43 fps and just 44
FPS once overclocked the G 4400 on the
other hand was slightly faster with 48
fps and just 49 fps once overclocked the
margin between the 860 KNG 4400 doesn't
really change with the r9 380 but we do
find that the overclocked configurations
provide a more meaningful advantage the
860 K average of 41 FPS minimum of the
standard clock speed but was able to
match 44 FPS of the GTX 960 once
overclocked much the same as spam and
using the G 4400 with the r9 380 it
averaged a minimum of 45 fps and it's
out of the box configuration and went on
to average the same 49 FPS minimum once
overclocked as it did with the gtx 960
this means without any overclocking the
g 4400 was roughly 10% faster than the
860 k with either the 380 or 960
having overclocked with both processors
the g 4400 was 11% faster than the 80 ck
with both graphics cards it's also
interesting to note that the standard
three point three gigahertz g 4400 was
still
I'm cent faster than the overclocked 860
K the gtx 960 and two percent faster
with the r9 380 when comparing the
minimum frame rate however for me the
average minimums don't tell the whole
story there were just two instances with
a stop G 44 hundredfold hood and they
were seen when testing the Boston City
section and fallout 4 and novigrad with
The Witcher 3 in both instances
overclocking fix the performance issues
and saw the G 4400 easily outperform the
overclocked 286 TK the quad core 860 K
on the other hand a process that many
would expect to deliver more consistent
performance seemed to be all over the
place essentially it was only the GPU
bound games with 860 K kept is cool
games such as Batman Arkham Knight
battlefield 4 Mad Max rainbow succeed
and Star Wars Battlefront all played
nice with the 860 K however the more CPU
dependent titles such as fallout 4 Just
Cause 3 in The Witcher 3 played very
poorly on the 860 cave call of duty
black ops 3 was another game there were
ran okay with the gtx 960 but not so
much with the i9 380 in fact AMD zone r9
380 wreaked havoc on their budget quad
core processor and this is the very
reason why AMD started pushing low-level
api's such as mantle a few years ago the
fact that the G 4400 is a dual-core
processor in the 860 K is a quad core
really doesn't play any significant role
in this battle certainly not like many
would have you believe however if you
could have the clock speed of the G 4400
from the standard three point three
gigahertz to one point six five
gigahertz and added two more cause it
would likely end up being slower in
almost all of these games that probably
shouldn't surprise anyone but I'm trying
to make the point that the more cause
aren't necessarily always better at
least when comparing different
architectures please note that I'm not
trying to bash AMD here and I'm
certainly not suggesting the clock for
clock the 860 K is half as fast as the G
4400 but it has to be said that Intel
Skye IPC efficiency is considerably
greater than that of AMD steamroller
so in this comparison comparing the
number of cores is about as useful as
comparing megahertz
it's not all good news for potential g
4400 buyers though and what is the very
slimy move we believe Intel is currently
working to disable non K overclocking
do this in an update to the processes
microcode which will be delivered in the
form of a BIOS update this means that
those with the overclocking bias will be
stuck with a current revision if they
wish to keep their overclock this isn't
a big deal though and chances are you
would only need to update your buyers
from this point forward to support a new
processor anyway overall both the athlon
x4 860 k and Pentium G 4400 deliver
impressive performance at well under
$100 but we feel the more consistent G
4400 is the better bye thanks for
