km 780 review and I was really impressed
with the feature set especially for the
price so I'm expecting really good
things from this mouse to looks-wise the
mouse is kind of sporty but also
industrial it matches the keyboard well
black panels appear to sit around what
looks to be a silver aluminium frame
however this is actually plastic on
closer inspection but it's pretty tough
to tell the difference I like the look
but I'm not crazy for it though this is
obviously subjective like all high in
peripherals these days the MX 780
features RGB lights which can be found
under the GCL logo at the back on two
little lines inside the silver midriff
either side of the mouse wheel and at
the front beside the Ripjaws logo the
front side lights indicate the mode
selection and the lights through the
middle show you the current dpi level
there's 8 buttons in total on the mouse
including the left or right mouse
buttons the two buttons featured on both
sides of the mouse the middle click
button beneath the wheel and an
additional button just behind the wheel
in the center the mouse is designed to
be fully ambidextrous so depending on
which hand you're using the side buttons
will be easy to reach for your thumb but
tough to reach for your pinky finger on
the other side making the mouse truly
ambidextrous there the removable side
panels which can be swapped in and out
to include a little thumb rest I'm a fan
of the field the little thumb rest give
on my so it was cool to see this
included for both varieties and lefties
when these panels are removed you can
also get access to the spaces available
for inserting the included four and a
half gram weights for those that are
incredibly in tune with their mouse
adding to the already impressive
customization is the adjustable back
side that can be raised and lowered to
suit different grips users who like to
use a palm grip will find this
particularly useful the hex screw used
to make these adjustments is found in
the bottom of the mouse which is
actually made from real aluminium and
also features five smallish feet for
smooth gliding as I mentioned in my km
780 reviewed the g.skill software is
serviceable the same suite can be used
for both of these products which is
always good and it's powerful enough to
make any changes that most users want to
dpi shift is available and this is
usually handy for those that like to
shift to a lower dpi for sniping and
gaming I actually just use it for
precise image edit
things like lift off distance and scroll
speeds can also be adjusted here to the
mouse employs an 8200 dpi of agro laser
sensor which is able to track movement
at up to 150 IPs and 30g of acceleration
and this felt very accurate to me it
also worked well on basically any
surface as good laser sensors tend to do
the buttons on the mouse give a nice
satisfactory clear can provide plenty of
clicky feedback they're also rated for
20 million clicks - overall the MX 780
is a great Mouse with a strong feature
set I like the fact that it's completely
ambidextrous and the thumb rest is nice
and wide and comfortable the shape and
size is definitely suited to either a
claw grip or palm grip user and the
adjustable back side really helps in
this aspect there isn't a wealth of
buttons on this Mouse but there's
certainly enough for most users with for
total side buttons and the additional
center button pricing wise the MX 780 is
very competitive in Australia I could
find it easily for $70 and on Amazon in
the USA you can grab it for 55 it's
great to see such low Australia taxes
for these impressive g.skill products
and the pricing in the States is very
very competitive at the high end of the
gaming peripherals market what do you
