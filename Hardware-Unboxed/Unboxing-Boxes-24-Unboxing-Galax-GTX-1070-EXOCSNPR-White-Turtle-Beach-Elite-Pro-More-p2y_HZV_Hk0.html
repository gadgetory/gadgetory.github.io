I normally don't bring you a video on
the weekend especially on Sat day but
I'm flat out this weekend doing a heap
of benchmarking as I explained in my
previous video and I thought this
morning is a Saturday morning I'd take a
bit of a time out and unbox a few boxes
I've had sitting around the office that
have clicked this week I thought I'd
check them out with you guys see what's
inside before I get back to benchmarking
hopefully I'll have time to edit this
and you will be seeing this on Saturday
afternoon we'll see how we go for time
but anyway without wasting any more time
let's get into it
I've got looks like this six boxes here
in total so quite a few know how long
this episode's gonna be why don't I
always open these the knife's on the
outside anyway first box oh something
very nice in here very nice indeed
that's not this a four bit of paper
that's a sample test report it's
definitely not that it is the Galax
geforce gtx 1070 and it is the special
sniper white XOC or extreme overclocking
that's exactly what it is very cool
graphics card now let's take a look I'll
probably aim to get the review of this
up pretty quickly actually I know it's a
1070 and you know we've seen a few 1070
s there's probably not anything terribly
new with this one I can get it oh the
box why do I always have trouble getting
things out of boxes probably should've
thrown that away all right what have
they got for us here it is indeed white
as advertised
that's very sleek it's a very gloss
white on the front there and same on the
back is a really cool backplate here and
it looks like they've got sort of like a
clear plastic possibly an acrylic around
the edge and I'm sure there's RGB
lighting that will make that light up
and give a really cool effect it's quite
thick around here so I'll be sitting in
the case like that you can see that bar
glowing so that's pretty cool actually
looks like a decent-sized cooler what
else can we find out about it standard
i/o configuration there obviously it's a
dual fan design and as I understand that
because I was expecting this card I'm
hoping to get the review up next week
we'll see how he'd go for time but it's
very well priced considering it is one
of the it's designed to be a sort of
top-end 1070 if you will and I think
they're charging 430 us over in the
States and it's about $600 here in
Australia which is really good
considering that base model like the
bland no factory overclocking simple
coolers they start at about 550 so it's
a $50 ozzie premium for a good cooler
RGB lighting and a really sleek looking
white paint job something that's pretty
fair should be good but of course we'll
have to test it and see how it handles I
believe it's factory overclocked by
about 6 percent I think the base clocks
about 15 94 megahertz and boosts who
about 1784 so 1700 and 84 megahertz so
that's pretty decent like I said it's
about a 6% overclock over the factory
cards so you should expect around a 3 to
5 percent gain probably somewhere around
there yeah very nice card indeed so if
anyone is looking at getting their hands
on a 1070 this might be a cool model to
get especially in Australia I usually
start with the big boxes clear them off
the desk so this is Linux biggest or
probably the biggest actually alright
what do we have inside box number two ah
okay Wow we'd have to get all this out
I'm not even sure what I'm looking at
here three boxes okay so this looks like
a very serious gaming headset setup
we've got the turtlebeach Elite Pro
headset or get your gaming headset so
actually there you go around the right
way now so we'll take them in have a
look at them in a second but they've
also sent along their noise cancelling
mic so I'm off to give that a bit of a
quick test that's pretty cool and
they've also set along
their tactical audio controller so that
allows you to change I that would sit on
your desk so you've got a volume knob
therefore the volume you've also got a
mic level outbound mic boost
background noise limiter and game chat
volume so wow that's pretty serious
stuff there there's a few presets that
can be loaded it looks like and you can
enable/disable surround mode and
enable/disable to mic so that's a lot
more than you're getting the usual
inline remotes just have a quick look at
the headset alright let's check these
things out yep that's a black box okay
these look pretty substantial actually
Wow okay so in the standard package you
do get a 3.5 millimeter looks like cable
and that has volume control and disable
enable mic and this nifty little inline
control there so that's pretty cool the
volume wheels there that little orange
switch there enables disables mic and
then you've got this detachable quite
flexible microphone so that's the basic
mic that plugs in there and it can 360
degree rotate so when you're not using
it you can pop it up there and there you
go ready for action or there anyway and
then there's this loose floppy cable
hanging down here and we've got what
looks like sort of a micro USB connector
that goes in like that clips in quite
nicely and that end goes to your PC your
sound card yeah so right away they're a
very solid feeling headset they're
reasonably heavy but nothing ridiculous
and they offer plenty of adjustment they
swivel really nicely so they should be
very comfortable let's go find out
Wow yeah they are super comfortable on
initial impressions I've wear them well
haven't been wearing them for long
obviously but they feel really nice and
yeah that's really cool when you shake
your head around you can feel them they
move quite a bit actually but when you
stop shaking your head they seem to like
reset to the original position so that's
really nice I like these a lot of course
I'm very keen to see how they actually
sound and how well the mic works also we
do have that noise cancelling mic it
clips into place quite nicely you'll
hear it
clip in that's quite hard to pull back
out but I suppose you don't want it
falling out so that's a good thing see
that that Michael looks very serious
keen to try them out and see the
difference between the two yeah very
cool and then the final piece of this
elite pro series is the audio controller
Wow clearly been to a reviewer before
it's got a few marks on it but not till
I heard he okay so we got an optical
cable and we have a USB type B cable or
type A or type B and three point five
mil audio jack so yeah there's a HEPA
connectivity on the rear of this thing
and it looks like you can set up two PC
mode Xbox mode or ps4 mode so it'll
cover the console guys as well so I
suppose that's pretty cool
even though we're really only interested
in the PC stuff yeah that's so you sit
that on your desk you plug the headset
in you would then use this to your
computer and then you have full control
over everything just sitting at your
desk so you've got your volume wheel
there your levels for various things
well they move quite nicely I imagine
this all lights up when it's got USB
power let's put that to the test well
there you go
it does indeed all line up that looks
pretty impressive the volume wheel has
LED indicators red indicators dunno how
well it's coming out I might throw up
some b-roll as I often do that's cool
that is a very impressive looking
addition to this headset I like that a
lot
and then even all these buttons the
different levels and presets light up so
you know where you're at just by looking
at that LED light so yeah very very cool
indeed I'm not sure how much this
add-ons worth but I know their headset
itself with the standard mic is a
hundred and sixty-five US which seems
very fair considering the build quality
the comfort obviously I haven't heard
the sound yet but if it's anywhere near
as good as the build quality in comfort
then I expect it to be extremely good
and they're 270 ozzie so that's a fairly
accurate conversion slight premium
possibly for us LG's but still for what
it looks like a really nice headset
that's a great price I really like these
I'll probably test these out today and
I'll leave a note in the comments about
how they sounded and stuff because I'm
not sure if I'll actually get to do a
detailed review on them might be out of
palm that often Tim we'll see how we go
I know he's got a lot on his plate as
well plenty of content coming up from
Tim over the next few weeks alrighty
next package will go with this FedEx one
it feels like there's absolutely nothing
in that it's yeah feels empty sounds
empty level look yep okay what do we
have here the new Samsung Evo plus 128
gigabyte micro sd card has an SD adapter
in the package yeah that's why it was so
light because that's all it was in there
but yeah that's 128 gigabyte that little
card there I have to admit I'm a little
confused by this product I'm not quite
sure what's going on but I'm sure it's
just because I don't have all the facts
yet obviously I haven't tested it and I
haven't really researched I didn't even
know it was coming but it has arrived
and I just quickly checked a few things
because I was like I've reviewed the
Samsung Evo plus before but turns out it
was a slightly different Evo plus which
is where the confusing part comes in
last year I reviewed the 256 gigabyte
micro SD card which looks virtually
identical to this one but it's
apparently different so this is the Evo
plus where Plus is written
as PL us and the model I looked at was
the Evo plus with the plus symbol so
yeah there's two Evo pluses both microSD
cards both designed for 4k cameras
extremely confusing
Samsung says that this model will
sustain 100 megabytes per second for the
read and 19 megabytes per second for the
write and apparently the previous model
that I reviewed currently achieve around
48 megabytes per second of sequential
read which is again really confusing
because I tested the 256 gigabyte model
and that was easily good for 90
megabytes per second read and write it
was very impressive high performance
drive so I'm not quite sure what's going
on and what's different about this one
so I guess we gonna have to call it the
old Evo plus and the new Evo plus so
again extremely confusing for us there
are viewers and no doubt for you the
consumer but anyway the new model is
apparently leveraging Samsung's new
advanced NAND technology to achieve
impressive speeds and capacities except
again the speeds seem the same based on
my previous testing of the 256 gigabyte
model and the capacities also seem the
same as this comes in 64 gigabyte 128
gigabyte and 256 gigabyte just as the
previous Evo plus did so yeah very
confusing product here from Samsung not
quite sure what's going on there but
I'll probably crack this out do a gonna
testing and try and work out what the
difference is I'm also very keen on the
pricing there is no pricing information
or at least my brief search I wasn't
able to find any pricing for this
product but yeah
Samsung's new Evo plus again all right
we have a package here from what looks
to be Logitech based on the tape very
small box usually Logitech boxes are
quite large so what do they have for us
today ah interesting these aren't new
so these are the j-bird X threes they've
been out for a while now I definitely
won't be reviewing these but we'll take
a look at them anyway back when Matt was
helping me with the channel he looked at
what I think it was the j-bird the
freedoms and they were very cool he
loves them
see a nice clean packaging as they
always do for the Jaybirds and for those
of you that don't know this is a
wireless earbuds set so although I won't
be reviewing these because reviews went
up on these late last year we did review
the freedoms last year so I'll just have
a quick look at these and see how they
differ from the freedoms as you can see
compared to the frames think the main
thing is here that they are bigger
earbuds the freedoms were super sleek
very small because the battery was down
in the controller here whereas the
batteries for these are in each earbud
which makes the earbuds themselves quite
a bit heavier but I've from reviews I've
seen they do stay in your ear quite well
probably not as well as the frames
because that extra weight but they still
do a good job of hanging on the charging
method is very similar so you just clip
this on to the controller like so plug
that into a USB charger or the port on
your PC or whatever you have I believe
it's about an hour or so it takes two
charges it obviously depends on how
you're charging them whether it's with a
you know a dedicated charge or offer USB
port or whatever but fully charged it
will last up to eight hours which is the
same time as the freedoms and it also
offers a quick 15 minute charge feature
which will see it lasts about an hour so
if you're going on a jog or a run for
about an hour and they're flat you only
need 15 minutes charge them up and
you're good to go but one disadvantage
with the design is they don't include an
external battery pack which you can have
pre charged clip that on and have that
charge the main battery while you listen
to music on the fly so that feature
doesn't exist but you do have the quick
charge so that kind of makes up for it
the earbuds and all that stuff are much
the same you get the small medium and
large there's the silicon ones
apparently the phone ones have been
changed they're a bit more sticky they
feel a bit better but again all of it is
sweat proof like the freedoms are so you
there
pricey but that said they are a premium
any wireless headset and really that's
pretty much what you pay for a premium
any wireless headset
I know Matt loves his freedoms we got
two sets of the freedoms last year for
you a white pair and a black pair Matt
took one of those left one with me and
yeah I've spoken to him since and he
thinks they're brilliant really enjoys
them he uses them regularly and the set
I had I gave earlier in the year I think
was around January I palmed him off to
my dad because he is a regular gym goer
does a lot of jogging he hits the gym
pretty much every day so good on him I
certainly don't but yeah he loves them
swears by them so he's been enjoying
them can't get over how good they are
and wishes they were in his life a bit
earlier anyway so that's good so yeah
people who do a lot of sport activities
and that kind of stuff that's who
they're for moving on we'll see what we
got here alright so as you guys are
probably aware next week I'm giving away
a full of Rison seven 1800 X system
which has been pretty much brought to
you by Thermaltake they were responsible
for making the competition happen and
they will be footing the bill for
sending the system globally so that's
very cool
and they provided six of their 120
millimeter ring plus fans which look
amazing and as you will see next week
I've configured them around the case but
we didn't have an exhaust fan and we
really needed a 140 millimeter exhaust
fan and when I initially built the
system I just chucked a fan that I had
laying around in there and hope that we
could upgrade it so when I took the
system the thermaltake they're like yep
that's not gonna do we need our 140
millimeter ring fan so we opened up this
box stuck one in and then they have sent
the other two that are left in this
package for me to use in a build or
whatever so I thought that's cool
because we've previously I hadn't looked
at the 140 millimeter versions we had a
bit of a preview of the 120 millimeter
versions a few months ago but these are
basically the same deal just bigger I
actually think the effect looks better
as well I'm not sure if there's more
LEDs or it's the same amount based on
what I've seen it looks like it's
probably the same amount of LEDs so they
spread a bit further apart and I
actually think that looks better it
gives a cooler effect in my opinion
but yeah so I've got two of those and
the digital controller so I'll probably
feature them in something before too
long I've got the in the side of this
case here I've got the 120 millimeter
versions they just go through the
rainbarrow cycle at the moment but they
look pretty cool they are expensive fans
of course oh because they are thermal
takes most premium fans they do offer
cheaper fans so if these are out of your
price range they will have something
else for you
but the 140 millimeter versions are a
hundred and twenty US in a pack of three
with the digital controller so again
quite pricy for fans but they are really
cool fans and they can do quite a few
cool effects there's a digital
controller which is completely software
controlled I know right now Thermaltake
are having a few hitches with the
software that runs them on some
platforms anyway I know Verizon right
now it's not working at all so there's a
bit of a USB to glitch there I believe
but they have assured me they are
working on that as we speak and there
will be a major upgrade to the software
soon and hopefully that will address a
few other problems that people have been
having with the software but for me it's
been working fine on the Intel systems
that I've tried them on they work it
works really well but it's a new product
so there'll be some teething issues then
we'll take obviously aren't known for
their software development so there'll
be a little bit of catching up to do
there but they are dedicated to making
these work really really well
improving the software so you will see
updates soon all right last one awesome
awesome awesome awesome
this isn't anything new but it is a new
arisin 1800 X chip for the giveaway PC I
had to acquire another retail 1800 X
chip AMD work before they did provide
the processor which is this fellow here
but it came a bit late so I didn't want
to delay building the giveaway that was
a heap of work to do as you will see
next week so I went and got another CPU
and put that in the system and they have
reimbursed me in a way with another one
which I can use for testing so as you
can see brand new horizon 7 1800 X so we
interesting see if this one over clocks
better than the one I had and if it's
better with memory support because I was
having a hell of a time getting even our
ddr4 3200 to work on my previous chip
tried heaps of tuning of
voltages and things and it just wasn't
playing ball so maybe this chip will be
a bit better we'll have to see
for those of you unaware the rise in 718
hundred x is retailing for five hundred
dollars u.s. or six hundred eighty five
dollars AUD which is an exceptional
price because it is a core i7 sixty nine
hundred K competitor it's roughly half
the price delivers the same or better
performance in productivity workloads
and the gaming performance is also very
good as well it's getting better all the
time as we've seen with the new ashes of
the singularity build and dota 2 as well
and yeah I'm sure there's more to be
discovered but having said all that
though I recommend you don't buy this
processor and instead get the horizon 7
1700 as that's something like 30%
cheaper I think it might actually be
exactly 34 percent cheaper anyway it
doesn't matter it's a lot cheaper
it's 330 u.s. or 450 ozzie and at that
price it is a phenomenal Buy you guys
probably saw we put it into Tim's
editing rig and overclocked it I think
it was a week or so ago now overclocked
the performance was exceptional we
actually exceeded the 1800 X overclocked
you should get pretty close to an
overclocked 1800 X I mean they're pretty
much the same ship there's just a little
bit of bidding going on but depending on
how lucky you are with that silly
candelato you might even get a better
chip than what you would have if you had
a board an 1800 X so yeah I've said it
plenty of times on the channel but I'll
say it again anyone who's looking at
building a bit of an all-rounder so you
do a bit of gaming some sort of
productivity whether it's content
creation or whatever else the horizon 7
1700 is the chip to get there's pretty
much nothing that competes with it and
it makes the entire Broadway Lee line at
its current price and completely
pointless and not worth touching so
there you have it so yeah a successful
unboxing I think I'm very keen to test
this guy out see how cool it runs held
overclocks power consumption and gaming
performance all that kind of stuff so
they'll probably unit be in a review
next week like just squeeze that in
somewhere with all the content next week
there'll be a video pretty much every
day from this point forward for at least
the next week so that shouldn't satisfy
the YouTube algorithm quite well now
yeah fun unboxing we've got a new
processor we've got a new graphics card
we've got a new micro SD card which will
work well in my 4k camera only
a 64 gig car at the moment so 128 giggle
mean I can sit here and talk longer
without filling it up so you guys love
that it's got the 14 140 millimeter ring
fans got a awesome looking headset here
from Turtle Beach I'm gonna go test that
out right now I'll probably use it for
editing this video and I might even try
and play some games tonight actually
that's not gonna happen there's no way
but anyway got the j-bird freedom so
yeah a lot of cool stuff really I love
this controller that's a really cool
feature I'll have to find out what
that's worth I'll put a link in the
video description so you guys can check
it out but I reckon that will be well
worth the investment to pair with that
headset because yeah that's very cool so
that's all for this one I hope you guys
enjoyed unboxing some boxes with me keep
your eye out for a review on this
graphics card I'll be doing a lot of
testing with this there's some memory
scaling stuff coming up I will be using
this processor for that assuming it does
what I want it to do and this new guy
will probably end up in my camera so
yeah thanks for watching guys I'm your
host Steve I'll catch you again soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
