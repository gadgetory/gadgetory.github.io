unboxed today I'm gonna be taking a
quick look at the Nexus travel Gaming
Mouse as you can see on first inspection
it's very similar in shape to the
SteelSeries sensei almost exactly the
same in fact fans of the shape of this
popular gaming mouse will love the next
year's revel for me though personally I
find it much more comfortable to have
some sort of thumb rest so I wouldn't be
using this as my own daily driver the
look and design of the mouse is quite
simple and it comes in either a glossy
white or rubberized black so depending
on your preference you can get the feel
that you like the Revel is a
right-handed mouse there's two of the
standard back and forward buttons on the
left hand side for your thumb rounding
out a very standard layout the only
extra button is the DPI switch in the
center behind the scroll wheel which is
nice and flat to prevent any accidental
presses this switch has eight stepping
points of 400 800 1200 1600 3200 five
thousand and twelve thousand CPI this is
all you can really customize on the
mouse as there's no special accompanying
software or driver making it nor round
simple package the prime selling point
of the Raval i feels the pmw 3360 sensor
which is widely regarded as the best
sensor you can get in a mouse
it does feel extremely accurate and
smooth to use though I haven't done any
truly technical testing myself I'll
leave that to the mouse sense of
specialists and take their word that
it's the best the USB cable is nice
light and flexible which is definitely
what you want in a wired mouse braided
cables give a high quality look but it's
generally a lot stiffer no take light
rubberized cable any day the main
buttons on the mouse I'd say a medium in
resistance they aren't super light
that's for sure and they do give plenty
of feedback the side buttons on the
mouse aren't quite as responsive as I'd
like there's a bit of travel before they
activate and some slight wobble the
wheel performs well and features some
nice little treads for good finger grip
the underside of the mouse which is
quite small Mouse feed but I didn't find
this to be an issue at all I would like
to see how it would have felt with
larger ones though the mouse is really
quite light overall it is 85 grams so it
still felt extremely smooth and easy to
move around my mouse pad all-in-all the
Nexus travel is a solid gaming mouse it
delivers the industry's best sensor in a
simple
no fuss package and it has shaped that a
lot of people are very fond of I can see
those with an old worn SteelSeries
sensei
perhaps upgraded at this new revel and
loving the fact that there's no painful
transition period as they get used to a
new shape keep in mind that it's a
right-handed Mouse only and not all of
the mouse buttons of the highest quality
those who enjoy macros lighting in extra
buttons will cost be left wanting to
come in at 50 US dollars the pricing is
pretty fair for a mouse using the 3360
sensor in Australia you can go over for
60 bucks which is good to see to what do
