we're checking out the most affordable
six core processor ever to be released
the core i5 8400 yes it's cheaper than
even the Rawson 5 1600 though it doesn't
feature hyper threading support so
unlike the rise and cpu there aren't 12
threads on offer still for gamers 6
cores should be ample and under $200
u.s. the core i5 8400 might be the new
go-to option for gamers on a budget it
is worth mentioning though this is a non
k model and therefore it is locked and
cannot be overclocked therefore
consumers will be better off pairing the
core i5 8400 with a motherboard not
featuring the zed 317 chipset as they
are typically more expensive and really
only enable overclocking for unlocked
parts aimed he were a bit cheeky and
somewhat annoying it has to be said with
their chipset and aiming for Rison I
mean be 315 X 399 come on guys anyway
since it would cause mass confusion
having both aimed E and Intel with be
350 motherboards that are in no way
compatible Intel decided to one-up the
cheeky buggers and go with B 360 Biggers
always better consumers know this so a
win for Intel the only issue for those
after B 360 motherboards is the fact
that they won't be available till next
year only Zen 370 chipset boards will be
released in 2017 which is a bit of a
blunder on Intel's behalf also remember
that Intel's coffee-like CPUs aren't a
drop-in upgrade for z170 or z2 70
platforms since Intel changed the
alignment of the design so for now Core
i5 8400 shoppers will have to go with
the cheapest Zen 370 board they can dig
up and right now that means spending
about 120 dollars u.s. anyway she means
you can pair the 8400 with a relatively
cheap mother what it looks like Intel
may have exposed a hole in Rosen's liner
Intel's price the eye-fi value for
hundred alongside aim DS Rison v 1500 x
which only has 4 cores though it does
have 8 threads so that might place them
relatively on par in terms of resources
on paper it certainly looks to be an
interesting battle so let's go see how
it plays out in the real world full
disclaimer we have tested the core i5
8400 on the Zen 370 motherboard using
ddr4 3200 memory for now I only said 370
boards will be on sale and it's very
likely that when paired with the B 360
board next year you will be limited to
ddr4 2666 or 2400 memory speeds so keep
that in mind anyway for those using a
Zed 370 board it's possible to use ddr4
3200 memory and doing so enables a
bandwidth of 36 gigabytes per second
place in the core i5 8400 on par with
the core i7 8700 K moving on we have
some Cinebench r15 results and here the
i5 8400 was good frame multi-threaded
score of 869 points making it nine
percent faster in the Rison 5 1500 X and
just 13 percent slower than the previous
Intel flagship part the core i7 77 ok
it was also 23% slower than the horizon
5 1600 though the single thread score
was almost 20% higher so it will be
interesting to see how the core i5 8400
and rise in cpus compare in real world
applications before we get to that
though here is a quick look at the pc
mark 10 results this test really lacks
clock speed certainly more so than cause
as a result the new core i7 87 RK does
very well as does the Core i5
8400 which proved to be 12 percent
faster than the Rison 5 1600 the Excel
Monte Carlo simulation makes good use of
many cores and threads as a result the
Core i5
8400 was 22% slower than the rise and
5/16 hundred and five percent slower
than the 1500 X that said that was a
decent step up from the previous
generation Core i5 7600 K complaining
the workload 12 percent faster the core
i5 8400 also comes in well behind the
rising competition in the veracrypt
benchmark here was almost 40% slower
than the rise in 516 hundred and 12
percent slower than the 1500 X that said
it was again much faster than the 7600 K
offering around 36 percent greater
throughput moving to 7-zip the core i5
8400 is able to just edged out the Rison
5 1500 X in the decompression test while
crushing it for the compression test
that said it was slower than the risin 5
1600 for both the compression and
decompression work
our handbrake workload doesn't agree
with horizon and even the core i5 7600 K
beats the Rison 5 1500 X and that
explains why the core i5 8400 is able to
match the r5 1600 that said it was just
15% fast in the 7600 K and the reason
for that being that the older cable
eight parts operate at higher
frequencies content creators might be
interested in what the core i5 8400 has
to offer testing with Premiere Pro CC
show that the Intel 6 core CPU was a
nine percent faster than anybody's rise
in 516 hundred in this application of
course you can overclock the Rison 5 CPU
and that will no doubt put it ahead but
still an impressive out-of-the-box
result for Intel the rising graphic 27
workload shows the core i5 8400 only
trailing the Rison 5 1600 processor by a
slim margin in blender while it was
significantly faster than the r5 1500 X
and i-5 7600 K however the more extreme
gooseberry workload actually sees the
core i5 8400 perform much closer to the
r5 1500 X than the r5 1600 although an
impressive 21 percent faster in the core
i5 7600 K it's now 24 percent slower
than the r5 1600 next up we have the
corona benchmark and here the core i5
8400 was it much faster than the risin 5
1500 X completing the workload 6 percent
faster it was however 42% faster than
the 7600 K so an impressive step forward
there the final application benchmark
looks at performance using povery and
here the core i5 8400 finds itself
situated between the risin 516 hundred
and fifteen hundred x as well as last
generations core i7 7700 K&amp;amp;I v 7600 k
okay so time to do some gaming as we saw
previously with the 8700 k these high
end Intel CPUs are actually limited by
the GeForce GTX 1082 at 1080p using the
ultra quality preset in battlefield 1
therefore the core i5 8400 delivered the
same 137 FPS minimum and 157 FPS average
we'll look at the 720p performance in a
moment before that though let's check
out the Vegas 64 results moving to Vegas
64 liquid-cooled the Rison 5 1600 is
much more competitive as now just 5
percent slower than the core i5 8400
that said as I just noted we are GPU
limited Tony P so let's check out the 7
20p numbers the first 720p results are
based on the gtx 1080i testing and here
the core i5 8400 was still able to match
the 87 okay
though without the 200 FPS frame cap the
margin is likely to grow 3500 was also
50% faster than the rise in 718 her
obviously a pretty massive margin using
vega 64 the core i5 8400 s performance
remained much the same but the Rison 7
1800 x is now 22% faster and that place
is ahead of the 7600 K moving on went
back to 1080p and this time we're
checking on ashes of the singularity
escalation comparing the heavy batch
figures the core i5 8400 was 11 percent
faster than horizon 5 16 hundred and
twenty-one percent faster than the 7600
K while it was able to match the 7700 K
swapping out the GTX 1080i for the Vegas
64 liquid-cooled graphics card we don't
really see much of a change here and the
results are similar across the board
testing civilization 6 using the DirectX
12 API we see at the core i5 8400 and
Rison 5 1600 are quite similar in terms
of performance that said though neither
were much faster than the r5 1500 X or
Core i5 7600 K either now with Vegas 64
liquid-cooled installed the core i5 8400
falls behind their eyes and 5 1500
excess now considerably slower than
their eyes in 5 1615 percent slower and
in fact when comparing the average frame
rate finally we have f1 2017 and this is
the last game I've tested with for this
video the core i5 8400 matched the 87 ok
and here we see an impressive 182 FPS
minimum making at 24 percent faster than
arisin 5 1600 much the same scene with
the Vegas 64 liquid cool graphics card
installed the margins do close up a
little bit in this DirectX 11 title but
that's to be expected with a slower GPU
capping off the benchmarks here are some
power consumption figures here we see
the core i5 8400 does push total system
draw 9% higher when compared to the
horizon 5 1600 in fact it consumed even
more power than the horizon 7 1700 an
eight-course 16 thread CPU overall power
draw was comparable to that as a semi
Tamara K which isn't bad and a maximum
system drawer of 143 watts in the corona
benchmark is certainly very tame
okay before wrapping this review up we
should probably check out a few price
versus performance scatter plots work
out just how well the core i5 8400
stacks up in terms of value first let's
take a look at the Premiere Pro CC
results here the core i5 8400 did
exceptionally well beating not just the
Rison 5 1500 X but also the r5 1600 by a
convincing margin if we draw a line from
the 8400 to the 8700 K we see the only
CPU deliver better value is the horizon
7 1700 for those seeking maximum bang
for their buck while achieving a fast
encode time there are 7 1700 is still
the best CPU to get however if you don't
have 300 dollars to spend on a CPU than
the i5 8400 presents at a super great
value option that said though if you
pair the r7 1,700 with a be 350
motherboard and the core i5 8400 one is
n 370 board and factor in those costs
well now the horizon 7 CPU isn't a great
deal more expensive even so the i5 8,500
still stacks up well and is again very
competitive what about Corona typical
rendering workload well here the core i5
8400 was less impressive for a little
extra money the r5 1600 offers quite a
bit more if we draw a line from the r5
1600 to the r7 1700 we see at the Intel
coffee-like
i7 and i5 CPU is fall a bit short on
this one so it's by no means a slam-dunk
for the core i5 8400 once we factor in
entry-level motherboard prices the Rison
5 1600 looks to be considerably better
value for these productivity workloads
finally let's take a look at the ashes
of the singularity heavy batch results
using the GTX 1080 Ti well for games
that can utilize all six of the core i5
8400 scores and appears to offer a
noticeable performance advantage over
the rise in cpus the coffee-like series
really are the new kings of gaming I'm
keen to see how the horizon 5 1600 and
Core i5 8400 stack up when testing 22:30
games including overclocking for the r5
1600 this is something I will do in the
not-too-distant future
although the core i5 8400 still looks to
be the best value option including the
motherboard prices certainly makes it a
much closer fire even though the core i5
8400 is a lock CPU and that is to say
that it cannot be overclocked a
performance is still exceptional
on that note talking if over clocking I
know there'll be a few people that asked
well I didn't do any base clock
overclocking on this particular chip
well the reason for that is you can't I
know there's been a few rumors floating
around that you can but you certainly
can't the non-key models it get detected
and intel locks it out you get stuck at
102 megahertz on the base frequency so
to make a hurt increase so that doesn't
really net you ain't much in the way of
extra performance so you can't do that
you also cut enable enhance caused
either so you can't peg all six cores in
this case at the maximum boost frequency
so that can't be done I've tried the MSI
the Azeroth board that you see here and
some gigabyte boards and they all had
the same problem or not really a problem
just it's not possible as for the memory
performance stuff well if you're using a
Zed 370 board which you have to at this
point then you can utilize whatever
frequency your memory will support these
processors go up to very high speeds but
if in the future you're watching this
video and doing a bit of research in
you're buying a B 360 or a H 370 board
or something along those lines that
don't support overclocking then I think
you will be limited to ddr4 2400 memory
and in that case the gaming performance
will be a little less impressive in some
cases you could lose quite a few frames
so that's just worth keeping in mind
still I think it's pretty clear that
adding two extra cores and some extra
cash to the core i5 range is a wing move
it's a bit of a shame it took so long
until needed a bit of a kick up the
backside from AMD but I'm glad AMD were
able to do that and now we have some
exciting new processors to play with
anyway for $180 us the core i5 8400 is
going to be very difficult to beat of
course we still need more affordable
motherboards to really capitalize but
things are certainly looking good
depending on the application 8400 can be
faster than the rise in five 1600 though
it can have also be quite a bit slower
so depending on what you're doing rise
and still may be a better choice you can
of course overclock the r5 1600 and
that's a comparison I'll explore in much
more detail soon with the Hebrew games
but for these reviews I just like to
make a base comparison because not
everyone likes to overclock so just keep
that in mind
for now though when it comes to gaming
the core i5 84
hundreds certainly looks to be putting
Rison in a bit of an awkward position
and the same may even be true for the
core i7 range for the most part six
high-speed cause really are going to be
enough for all the latest and greatest
titles without any frame hitches at all
even those seeking extreme frame rates
for higher refresh rate gaming shouldn't
have any problem with these new coffee
like core i5 CPUs well that's another
eighth gen core review in the bag I hope
you guys enjoyed it and I'll catch you
again soon for more benchmark action oh
I'm your host Steve that's me</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
