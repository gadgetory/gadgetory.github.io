episode of unboxing
I unbox computer hardware in a
therapeutic way not really sure where I
was going with that intro sorry about
that I've got to be the head of myself
first package already opened we have a
few packages here but just jumping right
into it and what oh yes okay so this has
been heavily requested on Twitter quite
a few of you guys have direct message me
asking me to check out this thing so
what is this thing you'll ask well it
has an interesting looking power cable
and a little yellow packet right so in
this yellow packet is a laptop thing
it's a this one is a mini PCI Express
HDMI version and what this does is
basically this allows you to turn pretty
much any laptop particularly in this
case one with a mini PCI Express slot
typically used for Wi-Fi dongles and
things like that but if you're lucky you
might even have a spare line it allows
you to use an external door desktop GPU
your typical district' discrete graphics
card with your laptop so that's very
very interesting indeed as keV would say
aha so basically what it allows you to
do is like I said you plug a discrete
we've got one we've we've got a gtx 1070
so it goes our that away you pop your
graphics card in it much like you would
in any other PCI Express slot and it
sits like that on your desk next to your
laptop this then plugs into the mini PCI
Express slot so you're going to have to
take the bottom of your laptop off
usually there might if you're lucky you
might have like a little module that you
can get in rather have to take the whole
base of the laptop off but you could
modify your laptop because this does
need to be plugged in quite conveniently
so when you get home you just plug that
in part your graphics card
and then you have the full power of this
baby driving your laptop so it improves
gaming out of sight so there's not a
whole lot to this kit basically you have
the HDMI cable at one end mini PCI
Express Ella that obviously goes in your
laptop cell below then to power it you
have two choices
I'll just take this out actually
probably add some b-roll here to make
what I'm explaining a bit easier you
know there's a 12-volt DC input so you
can use a laptop style external power
bridge if you have one of those
obviously it will need to deliver enough
power to power your graphics card but a
graphics card on its own doesn't consume
a huge amount of power I will do a
separate video on this where I explain
all things in much more detail once I've
done the appropriate research but the
cheapest probably easiest way would be
to use this connector that comes with it
that goes to your mother earth so your
standard ATX power supply so just any
spare ATX power supply you can probably
get like a 400 watt model for next to
nothing so that's just a jump start it
and then you will have a four pin power
input here possibly the CPU for pin
would go into that to power the graphics
card then you will need to plug which
I'm what I thought this kit came with
that cable but it doesn't seem to you'll
need to run a PCI Express power cable
out and into the graphics card and yeah
it's pretty sure this kit came with that
I bought it off eBay so no doubts
missing some bits yeah so that's how
that works and then yeah you will go
from so I've got a laptop with a pretty
gutsy core i3 processor it works really
well but you have to use the core i3
processors integrated HD graphics and as
you guys know that runs like rubbish so
pretty powerful laptop that tarp play
games basically things like rocket
League and all that a way out of its
league so adding something even like a
gtx 1050 $100 u.s. graphics card would
make the laptop a whole lot more useful
at least when you're at home and it's
not a portable practical solution but if
you've got a decent laptop like what i
have and you don't want to go and spend
thousands of dollars on a new laptop or
$500 on the razor
the bolt being wear doesn't even come
with a graphics card or anything like
that so this is a cheap cost-effective
way of taking you grab your laptop the
couldn't game and tuning its 110 game so
I won't go into too much more detail at
this I'll do a bit more research a bit
more tinkering cuz I'm obviously never
used one before see how well it works
and if it is indeed worth the $55 u.s.
$55 Australian delivered sorry I paid
for this but of course you strive to
bring a graphics card and the power
supply and it looks like there's a few
more cables required for us to look into
whether that was meant to come with the
cables or not alright moving on
still haven't got over the flu yet
killing near this thing but anyway we're
getting there a lot better than I was
last week hopefully next week will be a
new week for me I'll be back to full
power
now this throttling business okay get
that out of the way we'll go with this
box what do we have here
ah these are interesting okay okay
pair of steel series headsets so that's
interesting I have really looked at any
of their products or headsets
a long time I believe they're called the
Arctic Octus five and after seven I'm
sure if I'm pronouncing that wrong you
guys will let me know in the comment
section now let's have a look at with a
look at the five first pretty funky
looking box their box artwork actually
it's very funky looking on the inside as
well pretty pretty cool alright well
right away I've got to say these feel
very very premium and look very nice as
well well this is I say this every time
I get a nice new headset but yeah these
do feel great they've got like a really
really nice feeling rubberized material
on the me ear cups there on the outside
of them it feels really cool then you've
got sort of a soft sporty feeling
cushion
it's got feels like
got memory foam in it and then an
adjustable band here on some metal clips
again more of that soft rubber all up in
here well they are super comfortable
retractable mic it bends to where you
want it quite well retracts nice and
easily but I like a barely hear myself
if they are insulate the ears very well
they lay flat on your desk that's really
good what have we got in the accessory
bin even the cables themselves are very
impressive little micro USB so we've got
a micro USB to 3.5 mm audio jack so you
can use them as an analog headset or you
can plug them into this controller which
looks like it would sit on your desk and
wing in this as I go as I always do with
the unboxing boxes series so if you
don't want to use your sound card or
whatever you have in your system you can
get rid of that and you can plug this
straight into this little nifty
controller so a nifty little controller
volume control theirselves an inline
thing but rather than have it somewhere
clipped on to you or whatever you can
just sit that on your desks off you
little where the headsets like a so you
get them around the right way so it's
fairly long you can set that controller
quite a way away from you if you have it
something like that on your desks off
your keyboard was here volume control
knob they're pretty easy to get to and
then that USB cable has got to be metre
and a half-ish long and that will go to
your pc the other cool thing about these
is you've got these obviously these
custom nice cables they look really good
but if you go to a LAN or a mate's place
or something and if you get this cable
you will still be able to use the
headset because it has a 3.5 mm audio
jack here as well so all you need to do
is get a 3.5 mm audio jack male-to-male
and you can plug it from here to your
sound card and you're good to go
or if you know down the track you happen
to be a bit clumsy and lose this cable
it doesn't mean the whole headsets
written off or you have to pay some
extreme fee to get this replaced you can
just get a cheap 3.5
Mill audio jack here we go plug that in
there obviously have a longer one in
this but then goes TAC on card and they
still work
you won't you'll lose obviously the USB
7.1 you know virtual sound feature or
whatever what do you guys don't really
care for that anyway yeah I really like
this and the custom cables look very
nice very cool indeed
and just the headset overall feels
really nice
all right before wasting too much more
time I should probably check out the
more expensive headset and then just go
over a few key features of each I might
give them a quick test source here we go
okay so again funky packaging
nice-looking stuff oh wow and this is
the next level version so I believe this
is a wild headset I do love a wireless
headset actually to be fair I pretty
much like any wireless peripheral okay
so we've still got a heap of cable so it
probably does wide and Wireless so here
is our USB wireless receiver for the
headset and you can also plug lining and
line out to that so you can use this
with without having to use it wirelessly
so for example he would plug that into
there and then that into there and now
there are wide headset it also has a USB
cable so you can go directly to your PC
without having to use the wireless
module at all so there's plenty of
options here for how you want to connect
it to your PC so there it's as a while a
white headset you've also got a 3.5 mm
audio jack so you can plug it in that
way and just use your analog audio Sony
actually just have that as well yes so I
didn't cover that so both of these
headsets have on ear cup volume control
and the ability to mute the mic and then
of course they've always have that
retractable microphone that works and
looks quite good
well I don't know how well it works it
haven't tested it but given how nice
these are I can't imagine it's terrible
this has a nice band
the whole way around and then a steel
headband so super durable feels very
similar to this headset slightly heavy
heavier and say possibly only slightly
heavier but it fits on your head really
nice you're not going to throw that off
an attached room too easily
and again that folds flat so they both
hold flat on the desk I can see that all
the swivels and things like that they're
all made out of steel so they're not
going to snap very easily well then I've
got a snap it all basically so yeah very
high quality premium headset again the
memory foams in these which feels
awesome and the breathable ear cups so
you won't get too sweaty and you've got
that really rubberized material on the
outside of the ear cups as well thing I
like about them as well they're not a
fingerprint magnet at all like so when
you're picking them up there's nothing
worse than having a gloss headset
because they just look terrible so a few
quick details these Bose headsets are
available in black or white obviously
I've got the black version so you can
get them in white also and they have
quite impressive drivers in them so
they're both got neodymium forty
millimeter drivers in each ear cup and
these are apparently their s1 drivers
that's what skills here is call them and
they're the same drivers they feature in
their $300 headsets so they're supposed
to be quite impressive so good to see
they're offering them in these though
these aren't super cheap so yeah these
ones the actus fives they are $100 u.s.
or a hundred and seventy dollars Aussie
but they feel like they're worth every
bit of it obviously have still got a
test to see how good they sound but yeah
quality wise they certainly look like a
headset that would cost that much
and then the wireless version is it's
actually pretty good value in the u.s.
it's only $150 u.s. in Australia that's
two hundred and sixty dollars so quite
pricey down under so if I get a chance
I'll have a bit more of a look at them
towards the end of the episode but we've
got a few more things to get through so
I won't spend 20 minutes on the headset
let's jump into these which are clearly
both Nass products I'll put this one
down here okay so those of you who
haven't guessed this is from serology
and yeah definitely an app in this box a
big knife come on I'm getting awake okay
des 1517 plus so one of the big boys and
this is a brand new model okay this is a
serious-looking Nass this one
I know Nass devices are particularly
popular with you guys because as most of
you are quite tech savvy and PC and
thoose and like to mess around with
stuff if you were going to have a file
server or storage whatever you just make
your own using something like FreeNAS or
just Windows so I get that that's why I
don't really review many of these on the
channel but I have to say I really do
like these Nass devices especially now
that I'm doing stuff like tools of video
work and editing in that I don't really
have time to be messing around FreeNAS
and stuff like that I mean it's not
terribly difficult but just things like
you know maintenance and all that sort
of stuff and upgrade just a bit more
time consuming a bit more stuffing
around and what really makes sense with
these and what makes them practical is
that you don't need to be a computer
expert to have one and that's obviously
who they're targeting which is again why
I don't really review them on the
channel because most of you guys know
exactly what you're doing with PC
hardware not that interested in a
friendly little box for storing your
data but I found it useful for me
because when I'm at somewhere like
Computex for example and I need someone
locally like my wife or someone at home
to access data off this or do something
for me they can do it without a problem
you don't need a degree in computer
science to work it out and I mean that's
who there are targeted at so basically
small companies that don't want to pay
for IT so
and have an IT department I just want to
get one of these take out of the box put
the CD in they still have an optical
drive or just type in fine Synology comm
and it walks through the most easy setup
ever basically anyone can set this up
it's pretty much one of the easiest bits
of software and kit to use and that's
why there were so much because they
spend a lot of time developing the
software so it's not so much the hard
way you're paying for the hardware in
this particular model is quite good and
we'll get to that now so as I said this
is a Synology dis station it's the 1517
plus model and has five three and a half
inch drive three five and a half inch
drive bays kind of bit slow at the
moment power button they're everything
but basically inside you get a quad-core
Atom processor runs at 2.4 gigahertz no
boost on that particular model 2
megabytes of level 2 cache no level 3
cache and it's a 15 watt TDP processor
so you can leave this running 24/7 and
it's not pretty much of a dent in your
power bill basically the hard drives
inside will be consuming more power than
the hardware itself or the operating
Hardware around the back you will find
four rj45 Gigabit Ethernet ports and
they can all be used together with link
aggregation single client will only get
a hundred megabytes per second
throughput even with the link
aggregation but it just means multiple
users can be hammering the unit once and
be getting close to maximum throughput
it looks like in total we have four USB
3.0 ports throughout the back one on the
front and then you'll notice some eSATA
ports and these can be used to connect
to external expansion unit so you can
take it well if you use 10 terabyte 10
terabyte hard drives you'll have 50
terabytes of storage with this model and
I think you could probably add another
hundred terabytes or so with external
storage devices so yeah plenty of
storage there and then you'll notice
here we have a PCI Express expansion
slot and Synology this doesn't come as
standard I don't believe they've sent
this long as a bonus there m2 d-17 and
basically what this is is a PCI Express
half-height adapter card plug that in
and it will allow you
to insert to MDOT to SSDs I believe of
the nvme variety and they basically use
basically act as high-speed cash drive
so you can cash cash cash the data on
the five hard drive so stuff that's
being accessed heavily will come through
really quick though to take advantage of
that you will really want ten base or
ten gigabit ethernet rather than the one
gigabit so interesting you really need a
card that offers the cash or the cash
you really need a card that offers the
caching ability as well as upgraded
networking and finally for those of you
wondering it is $700 us for this model
so it's a top tier sort of small to
medium business targeted model would be
a very premium for home users bidding
like 700 dollars us and that translates
to about a thousand and sixty-five
dollars Australian so yeah I'm keen this
won't be as I said you guys really
aren't interested in this I get that the
video or the if I reviewed this other
channel wouldn't get that many of you so
I'm not going to bother might be
something I do in the future but this
will be going up on text spot so you'll
see that I'm textbook within the next
few weeks or so okay well I'm banging on
about maths devices might as well get
this guy out of the way so this is Q
Knapp's brand new TS four or five 3b and
again this is a small to medium business
class math device so very premium for
home users but this would actually suit
home users probably a lot better than
this one would because of the features
so I'll just grab it out so basically
this guy here is the jack-of-all-trades
there isn't much this thing can't do
it's basically an all-in-one nass
solution whatever that means making
things up as I go all right so on the
front here we have a USB 3 type-a port
but the most interesting part is we do
have a Type C and both of these are used
for the quick access function so you can
there's a few ways this works you can
plug storage in like an external hard
drive hit that button and it will
quickly copy everything off the drive to
a designated folder on the nests so
that's great for quickly dumping photos
I think
photographer you can also use the SD
card slot just to you so if you take
your SD card out drop it in there to
have to jump on the computer anything
just hit that button and it'll put it
all in a folder that you've selected so
that's nice and convenient also
alternatively with a cable which isn't
provided so if you have a type C cable
you can even use the the type a if you
have a basically a cable that can go
from here to the USB port on your your
notebook or your desktop or whatever you
can use this as a - so direct-attached
storage so if you take it somewhere
where there's no network or for whatever
reason the networks down or something
along those lines you can still access
your data on here quickly and
conveniently using a USB cable and
that's something you can't do with this
guy for example something else really
interesting about this model is the
front panel how it opens and closes
which I'll show you in a moment
basically most devices have what you'll
see here on the Synology where the
drives are all exposed and you can just
pop them in and out like that these ones
are lockable but yeah that's the more
traditional style so knowledge is more
mainstream home oriented and asteroids
they do have a front panel that goes
over but that uses rubber grommets to
pop in and out and it's quite difficult
to get back on once you pull it off so
that's a bit annoying it's not super
quick convenient whereas this is there's
a little lock on the side here wants you
to push that down and unlocks it and you
just that's it and now you can just pull
the drives there and just push this
little clip down drives come out and
they are also toolless as well so you
just pop the drive in pop that back in
and you're good to go
slide that in later so and then this
just slides back on and then this just
slides back on so easy it is actually
really easy if you're not a bloody
bonehead alright flipping around the
back we do find some interesting things
here
we have a pair of HDMI outputs and they
do support 4k displays so that's really
cool you can utilize some software that
and if you
our home user which you wouldn't really
be buying this model for being a home
user but you could watch 4k movies or
any type of content using those there's
also audio out and then you can use the
USB s to connect up keyboard and mouse
pair of Gigabit Ethernet ports power
input so it does have an external power
brick and that is a massive 120
millimeter fan which is quite large for
a full banner especially a compact one I
mean this is a 4 Bay that's the fireface
you can see there's quite a large
difference in size performance wise this
is still very snappy it's got a quad
core Celeron basic SOC and that operates
at a base frequency of 1.5 gigahertz
which is quite low but it can boost up
as high as 2.3 gigahertz so it should be
still quite snappy the other cool thing
about this model is like the expensive
Synology here this one also has a PCI
Express expansion slot and Tunip have
some really awesome options they sort of
one-up Synology that you can go with a
card much like the one I just showed you
that supports a pair of nvme SSDs and it
also has a 10 Gigabit Ethernet port as
well so that's a huge upgrade for this
model I think that's I think it's 206
dollars u.s. so it is quite pricey don't
quote me on that it's somewhere around
200 ish dollars but there's four
versions of it as well at stagger down
and price that have varied feature sets
and just finally I would like to note
that this model comes with either 4
gigabytes or 8 gigabytes of memory out
of the box and I strongly recommend
anyone interested in this model forget
about the 8 gigabyte version because it
cost an absolute arm and a leg they're
charging something like a hundred and
seventy dollar US premium for another 4
gigabytes of memory and we know 4
gigabytes memory only costs about $40
u.s. for laptop style memory so your mat
it's very easy to upgrade you don't void
your warranty upgrading the memory in
this model so yeah I would and it's
expandable to 16 gigabytes so yeah don't
buy the eight gigabyte model is
basically what I'm getting at there okay
final package
what do we have here some bubble wrap
some pink bubble whoo-hoo-hoo okay
yes just the one all right
would it be an unboxing boxes episode
without a graphics card so a couple of
them is excited about rx 560 but yeah
I've been trying to get one of these for
a long time the RX 560 has been a rare
commodity probably more so now that the
AMD GPUs are all being snapped up by
miners I have a video that sort of
touches on that later in the week I'm
done quite a few of you asked me to do a
mining benchmark video so I've looked
into doing that anyway this I want for
another video that I'm even more excited
about and that is the updated rx 560 vs.
GT x 1050 and I'll throw on the 1050 Ti
and basically that's a look at which is
the best value 100 dollar GPU obviously
these will be all out of stock right now
you won't go to buy one for hundred
dollars but that's going to change
before long I mean we've seen these
mining booms before they are called
mining booms for a reason so things will
settle down hopefully before too long
and you'll be able to buy one of these
though I don't recommend you buy this
particular version sorry about that
gigabyte nothing wrong with the gigabyte
card mind you it's just this is a full
gigabyte version and they start about
$140 u.s. when they are in stock and
yeah massive waste of money do not buy
the four gigabyte versions get the two
gigabyte cards don't listen to anyone
that says all two gigabytes that's not
enough for 1080p gaming in 2017 that
won't be enough in 2018 and beyond bla
bla bla bla bla completely ignore them a
full gigabyte card is a complete and
utter waste of money the GPU itself
doesn't have anywhere near the power to
utilize a full gigabyte vram buffer so
save yourself a heap of money and get
the two gigabyte card $400 it's very
important with these lower NT cards that
you do buy the cars that are priced at
the MSRP because even paying a $20.00
premium for something like this is just
a huge waste of money you're not going
to see that translate into other
performance so your base model rx 460 RX
5 60s rather same same true for the
60b a base-model rx5 60s base model GTX
10 50s and 1050 t is all the way don't
buy premium cars I don't believe there
is a Norris version of this card anyway
so no extreme rx 560 that would be
absolutely stupid
but yeah I'll have a quick look at the
card see although this is the full
gigabyte model that I recommend you
don't buy the exact same card is
available with two gigabytes of vram and
it sells or will be selling for $100
u.s. not 140 this guy sells for but even
at 120 dollars I still wouldn't
recommend paying $20 us for this car
because there's really no situation
where it's going to provide you better
performance it just as I said the GPU
simply doesn't have the horsepower to
utilize that much memory so complete
waste of money there yeah Compaq nice
little card looks like gigabytes gone
pretty heavy on the cooling for an hour
X 560 you got looks like - really big a
jewel length eight millimeter heat pipe
I believe so and it is it's only a
single heat pipe but it is an eight
millimeter copper heat pipe that looks
like it snakes through the entire length
of the card and the cooler spans the
whole length of the card takes up all
two slots as well so dual slot cooler
yeah I think that should run rather cool
get the most out of the rx 560 of the rx
500 series we obviously have the rx 550
which we've looked at and that's I think
that's priced at 70 or 70 or $80 us and
that's pretty poor value at that price
it really needs to be about $50 u.s. but
that is a completely new bit of silicon
in the rx 550 the rx 560 is the same
silicon as the rx 460 but it's fully
unlocked so you do get 1024 SPU's or
cause with the RX 560 so that's about a
14% upgrade over the 460 so you should
expect around about a 10% boost in
performance that would probably be a bit
more than that because those calls are
clocked six percent higher as well so
more cores clocked higher so it should
be a good bit faster than the rx 460
which is good because the rx 460 if I'm
honest - pretty much sucked the rx far
the RX force
7g is what I'm coming from struggling
big time here haha that was really
exceptionally good value and then the
460 was just a massive letdown but
anyway the second I finish filming here
I'm going to run upstairs Chuck this in
the test system and get benchmarking
I've already spent the last few days
benchmarking there ten fifty and the ten
fifty TI I've done that in 30 games so
it's gonna be a big benchmark video and
I've basically it's all at 1080p and
I've customized all the presets for them
so basically it'll be a combination of
medium to high at 10 P with these cards
for targeting around 60 FPS so realistic
settings realistic resolution and
realistic graphics cards so yeah it'll
be a good comparison it's a bit of a
shame you can't buy these right now
because it makes the comparison a little
less meaningful but as I said before
long these will return to the MSRP s you
better buy them again and my comparison
will be useful to you just notice my
shotgun Mike had swiveled around was
pretty much aiming at the ceiling so I
hope you're them too terrible for this
episode really struggling guys I'm going
to end it there
not the most exciting unboxing episode
so hopefully yeah hopefully it wasn't
too bad hopefully I can edit it and make
it a bit more entertaining B I got some
new hardware really keen to test this
out
got a few nasty devices there that'll be
reviewed on Tech's spot some really cool
headphones I not going to test them out
for this episode I just don't have the
energy if I'm honest but I'll probably
give them a test and show them in an
upcoming episode because yeah they do
look good at least report back on them
anyway because they definitely look well
worth testing very very good build
quality high looking high quality
looking headset so yeah I'll test them
out yeah I'm going to leave it on that
long guys thanks for watching hopefully
I'll be back to full fighting form in a
few more days it's been about 10 days
with this bloody flu so yeah hopefully I
can fully beat it soon and get back to
creating some content but I've got quite
a few interesting upcoming videos in the
works so stay tuned I'm you know you
Steve see again soon guys
