are testing out another
RTX board partner card and this one is
the RT x 2080
gaming era c8g and as you can probably
tell this one is from gigabyte for now
it is their most premium RT x 2080
product though you can basically get the
same thing with a less aggressive
factory overclock for about $40 less and
that is the wind force version so if you
see the wind force version of this card
and you're like what's the difference
between it and the gaming version it's a
small overclock probably won't make that
much difference at the end of the day
but I suppose if you're spending well
over $700 u.s. at best about $700 us on
a graphics card you're probably happy to
pay an extra $40 for a whisker more
performance just because as you can see
gigabyte has gone with an extremely
neutral theme with this one it's pretty
much a black grey theme very
minimalistic and I have to say I'm very
pleased to see those orange highlights
ago that they were intent on doing for
quite a while there yeah great to see
those gone and it's just a super
stealthy design in my opinion even the
RGB is very minimalistic you just have
the RGB logo here the gigabyte name
that's backlit and you can control that
with the RGB fusion software personally
I would have much preferred the gigabyte
logo or name whatever you want to call I
would have preferred this located over
here and then the GeForce r-tx in the
middle here because I think gamers would
probably rather show off that it is a
geforce r-tx card and this sort of
glossy black finish that they've given
the geforce r-tx branding isn't that
easy to see it's very discreet and I
think yeah as I said gamers probably
rather the gigabyte name to be more
discreet and that backlit here to show
off though it's a Geforce RTS card
something along those lines it is a very
minor detail and you could argue that
gamers really shouldn't care either way
but I feel like that's something that
people buying this card or quite a few
gamers buying this card would've
let me know what you guys think in the
comments section below anyway that small
detail aside I have to say this really
is a nice looking card and the neutral
design means that it will compliment any
and all builds covering the heatsink is
a black plastic shroud with a few
gunmetal gray aluminium highlights again
very stealthy looking and I very much
like it also it's quite a compact
high-end graphics card it's very similar
to the founders edition in terms of
dimensions a 50 millimetres wide it is a
dual slot card and it measures 287
millimeters long and 115 millimeters
tall so overall it is slightly taller
and longer but interestingly weighs
quite a bit less 973 grams making it 23
percent lighter than the FE model that
said does feature about 10 times fewer
screws speaking of screws in order to
whip off the cooler just seven screws
need to be removed and they're all the
same size Phillips head screws see
Nvidia doesn't have to be difficult with
all the screws removed you then have to
break the grip of the vrm and GDD are
six thermal pads and then detach the fan
power and RGB lighting cables at this
point you will have exposed the PCB as
well as the underside of the cooler
let's talk about the cooler first
including the plastic shroud on three
fans at way 644 grams removing the
shroud and fans from the heatsink
requires the removal of four more screws
and then we see that each fan is
attached the shroud using an additional
three screws per fan interestingly
gigabyte hasn't just wired all the fans
together but rather made them detachable
so any one fan can be quickly and easily
replaced this is great as it affords
users the ability to purchase the fans
once the cards out of warranty so you're
not forced to throw the entire cooler
way in favor of an aftermarket solution
and they've been using these fans for
quite some time the exact same fans were
used way back on their GeForce GTX 980 a
or around $17 u.s. finally all three
fans are the same they measure 85
millimeters in diameter moving on from
the fans we have the heatsink and what
we have here is 442 grams of copper and
aluminium in total there's half a dozen
six millimeter copper heat pipes all of
which come in direct contact with the
r-tx 2080 die
so there's no copper base here which is
why the cooler is so much lighter than
the version found on the founders
edition there is however a nickel plated
copper base plate for the GDD are six
memory chips and it can be removed via
four screws and taking it off we found
that it accounts 56 grams of the coolers
total weight it's worth noting that
there isn't any thermal interface
material taking up the gaps between this
plate and the heatsink now for the PCB
what we have here is basically the
founders Edition PCB and power delivery
system there are a few minor changes
here and there to the layout but overall
the design and components are very
similar then we of course have the
massive cheering GPU codenamed tu-104
there are also eight one gigabyte GDD
are six memory chips providing an 8
gigabyte vm buffer the chips in question
are microns MT 61 K 256 M 32 je 14a and
this is of course their fourteen
gigabits per second memory we also find
an 8 + 2 phase very amusing on
semiconductor power stages and finally a
6 pin + 8 pin power connector at this
point the only thing we haven't removed
is the back plate so let's quickly do
that before getting into the benchmarks
there's an additional three screws
holding the back plate on once removed
we can detach this thin sheet of
aluminium underneath we find three thick
thermal pads the design to reduce the
amount of heat that gets trapped under
this panel gigabytes targeting the area
behind the vrm and GDD our six memory
and therefore like many of the
manufacturers we've seen so far
gigabytes using the backplate as a big
heat spreader okay so that's the cards
physical design pretty much from top to
bottom so let's go to the clock speed so
we'll do a little bit of overclocking
and then of course get to the benchmark
results
the founders Edition model operates at a
boost clock of 1800 megahertz and the
gigabyte gaming oh you see that one runs
at eighteen hundred and fifty megahertz
out of the box so it's a smidgeon fast
you could say there is an option and OC
mode which boosts it by another 50
megahertz to eighteen hundred and thirty
megahertz but I've skipped over testing
that because it's less than a 1%
increase I don't think it's going to
translate into many more extra frames if
even an extra frame so we've skipped
over that I've gone straight to my
custom
overclock and I'll give you all the
details on that basically using MSI
Afterburner I was able to increase the
core by plus 150 and in the GDD r6
memory by plus 700 stock when gaming the
card ran at an average of 1890 megahertz
with peaks going as high as nineteen
hundred and thirty five megahertz the
fan speed also maxed out a whisper quiet
thirteen hundred and thirty rpm making
it much quieter than the FE model which
went up over two thousand rpm despite
running quieter the gigabyte gaming OC
also maintained a four percent higher
clock speed but better yet picked just
64 degrees whereas the FE card hits 76
degrees so quite shocking really that
gigabytes seemingly basic air cooler is
that much better I should also point out
that those higher idle temps are due to
the fact that the gigabyte card
completely turns its fans off during
light load and this is preferable to
running at around thirty degrees with
the fan spinning in my opinion as the
cards completely silent when idle and
this also greatly extends the life of
the fans overclocked to the gaming AC
average to clock speed of 2040 megahertz
which was slightly better than the 2025
megahertz of the FE model however
although the FPS performance will be
very similar the operating volume and
temperature isn't again the gigabyte
model is much cooler and quieter hitting
just 66 degrees opposed to 81 degrees
and it did so while only spinning the
fans and up to 1400 RPM now stock as I
said the Fe model spins its fans just
over 2,000 rpm and once I overclocked
almost 2200 rpm hitting 76 and 81
degrees respectively so I thought why
not get closer to matching that with the
gaming OC by dialing the fans up to 2100
rpm using this 60% fan speed setting
doing so drop to the low temperatures 57
degrees and the idle to 26 degrees as
the fans are now spinning constantly
this also increased the average
operating clock speed to 2070 megahertz
which is very impressive for those of
you who don't care about noise at all
you can crank the fans up to just over
3100 rpm and this reduced the load temp
by a further 10 degrees and allowed for
an average operating frequency of 2085
megahertz finally throw a few k-type
thermocouple x' on the card allowed us
to measure the sir
first temperatures at the top of these
components the power stages and the GDD
are six memory our overclock using the
auto fan settings or the vrm idle at 35
degrees and the memory at 38 degrees
then under load the verum hit 49 degrees
and the memory 57 degrees so both well
within tolerances okay time for some FPS
performance and as usual I'm using my
course a GPU test rig built inside the
crystal series 570 X packing a core i7
87 okay clocked at 5 gigahertz with 32
gigabytes of vengence ddr4 3400 memory
please note I only have overclocked
results for the founders ition model in
two games as that's all I tested
originally and Tim now has my EFI cards
so we can investigate things such as HDR
performance and DL SS anyway we do have
some overclocking results to compare so
let's get to the results first up we
have the battlefield 1 results at the 4k
resolution using the maximum quality
preset if you want to see how the r-tx
2080 performs at 1440p please check out
our day 1 coverage for this content
we're mostly interested in how the
gaming OC compares to the foundation
model and for that 4k will work just as
well as 1440p as the margins will be
much the same here we can clearly see
that out of the box the gaming OC
basically delivers the same performance
as the EFI model just 1 to 2 FPS better
in battlefield 1 overclocking helped us
squeeze another 6% more performance out
of the card nothing amazing but it is
free performance we see much the same in
f1 2017 the gaming OC match the EFI
model out of the box while our custom
overclocked only slightly boosted
performance and also please note the
weaker-than-expected frame time
performance for all the RT X GPUs are
still hasn't been solved in f1 2018 with
a driver update similar margins are seen
when testing with Far Cry 5 here are
overclock netted us 5 percent more
performance this time we see an 8
percent boost for our custom overclock
when testing with Assassin's Creed
origins that said the gaming OC nfe
models delivered the same out-of-the-box
performance this time we have OC results
for both the EFI and gaming OC models
and as you can see in shadow of the Tomb
Raider both models delivered the exact
same performance of course the gear IOC
is cooler and quieter as we saw earlier
but overall performance is much the same
and we can confirm those findings with
strange
the gigabyte gaming OC is able to match
the founders edition performance while
providing cooler temperatures and a
quieter operating volume the power
consumption figures are pretty much what
we expected to see though the gaming OC
uses slightly less power than the
founders Edition that was a small
surprise but overall the results are
very similar overclocking only increased
power consumption by four percent which
is a nice trade-off given that we saw
around a 5 percent performance uplift
gigabytes r-tx 2080 gaming OC is a
really solid graphics card delivers
excellent performance the same level
that you can expect from invidious
founders Edition but very crucially but
it does so with a lot less fuss and by
that I mean the operating temperatures
are lower and it makes a lot less noise
and I'm not saying a found Edition card
was particularly loud but this thing is
basically silent even after an hour's
worth of gaming full load for extended
periods of time and it's just a really
really quiet card and much better than
the founders Edition in that regard
I've got nothing bad or remotely
negative to say regarding gigabytes
implementation it's just a shame that
the current asking price is eight
hundred and thirty dollars us despite
being one of the cheapest custom RT x
2080 graphics cards available right now
of course it still doesn't make much
sense to purchase one of these r-tx 2080
graphics cards given the gtx 1080 TI
delivers a similar level of performance
for around $700 us if you missed our
coverage here is a quick breakdown of
how the RT x 2018 gtx 1080i compare in
35 games at the floor k resolution the
takeaway here being that the almost 20%
increase in price isn't justified by the
one percent increase in performance at
the AIB MSRP of $700 us the RT x 2080
would at least make sense at that price
I do recommend checking out the gigabyte
gaming OSI model it's a great quality
product offering excellent thermal
performance and it doesn't hurt the card
looks nice as well and will suit any
build and that is going to do it for
