on hand i have this this and this so
what are these well this is intel
seventh generation Core i7 77 okay
processor this here is a nifty little
tool that I picked up off eBay for just
$14 II delivered and it's a 3d printed D
lid tool for Ivy Bridge doubles Canyon
he has well sky like and KB Lake
processes and finally this is some
liquid pro or liquid metal as it's
probably better known throw in some kind
of inward pressure creating tool into
the mix like a clamp or vise and you can
MacGyver your way to much lower
operating temperatures before I get to
that little quick backstory as to why
I'm doing this a few weeks ago I built
my new GPU test rig using the 7700 okay
and the plan was to run this benchmark
system at four point nine to five
gigahertz the cooler of choice was cause
as excellent hydro h100 iv2 and I was
expecting to see fairly reasonable
operating temperatures what I saw at
four point nine gigahertz using one
point three volts was full load
temperatures well into the 90s in fact
the system peaked at around 96 to 97
degrees as a result I ended up backing
the system off to the same four point
five gigahertz frequency that I ran my
previous 6700k test system at to ensure
100% stability at all times when
benchmarking a few viewers commented
that I must be doing something wrong it
was the radiator placement I was using
too much voltage despite the fact that I
actually said I was using one point
three volts and so on most of you seem
to realize that seventy-seven okay is
just a hot ship and the reason for this
is down to the fact that Intel used a
poor quality thermal interface material
that being the case a good number of you
asked me to delete my 7700 K processor
and try again so that's exactly what I'm
going to do the first tip is to top the
77 arcade chip into the D lid tool and
apply some pressure this then breaks the
heat spreaders grip on the PCB this is
done easily enough and rather than film
myself doing this down the shed using a
bench vise I just used a cheap clamp
with the lid removed it was simply a
matter of
off the rubbish intel put on the dye and
replacing it with some liquid metal at
this point you could fix the heat
spreader back in place using an adhesive
but I recommend just leaving it sitting
on top and letting the LGA socket clamp
the processor and heat spreader in place
okay so now that we've done all that
it's time to see how much of an impact
this has had on operating temperatures
installing the 7700 Kaede back into my
corsair test machine I was shocked to
find that at four point nine gigahertz
using the same 1.3 volts the maximum
stress temp never exceeded 73 degrees
and for the most part hovered around 70
degrees I should also note that the fans
on my H 100 I weren't even speeding up
as the temp target for the performance
mode was set at 80 degrees so this
technically isn't even an
apples-to-apples comparison when forcing
the fans to spin up the temps maxed out
at around 68 degrees I should also note
that my testing was done with an ambient
room temperature of 21 degrees
unfortunately with 1.3 volts I couldn't
get my system to post at 5 gigahertz
going up to 3 point 5 volts got me into
the windows load screen but there the
system would lock up upping the voltage
to 1 point 4 got me into Windows but the
system wasn't 100% stable so for that 5
gigahertz frequency I will need to do a
bit more tinkering that said for now I'm
more than pleased with the 4.9 gigahertz
operating frequency especially given how
low those temps now are hovering around
the 70 degree mark at full load so if
your own and I'm up to seventh
generation Intel processor and you're
serious about overclocking d-lighting is
the way to go unfortunately doing so
comes with a bit of risk and the worst
part being that you will void your
warranty I have to say this is really
whore for from Intel's doing this to
their unlocked processors if it wasn't
already a low enough blow that Intel
we're charging a premium for their
unlocked processors they're now doing so
we're providing the same rubbish thermal
interface material that they use on
their locked models as a PC enthusiast
and a consumer I really can't stand this
and the need for AMD to deliver next
month is more important than ever all up
I spent 14 dollars on the D lid tool
which I grabbed off eBay 45 dollars on
the liquid Pro and then of course you
still need a CPU cooler so the unlocked
until processes they don't come with one
and so I used this Corsair model here
and that's about 150 dollars by the way
all these prices are an Australian
dollar that I'm quoting so Intel is
stinging over
clock is about a $40 premium for their
unlocked core i7 and then you need to
buy a cooler and spend about another $60
or so so you can actually have clock it
without risk of it cooking itself anyway
in summary I'm both impressed and
appalled by the improvements of this
little deal it experiment produced what
do you guys think let me know in the
comments below and if you think I vent
it consider giving this video a like
thanks I'm your host Steve and I hope to
catch you again soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
