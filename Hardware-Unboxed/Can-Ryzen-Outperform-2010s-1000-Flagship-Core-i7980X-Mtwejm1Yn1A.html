are gonna have a bit of benchmark fun
I've managed to get my hands on a
processor that until recently I didn't
even realize I hadn't benchmark before
and that is the core i7 and 980 X
processor in fact I haven't actually
benchmarked any of the 32 nanometer golf
town processors before again not sure
why that is I've bench my plenty of the
Bloomfield 45 nanometer parts I was a
big fan of the core i7 920 and I still
have a few of those floating around
actually but I never checked out any of
the golf town processors so why not do
that now before we get to the benchmarks
cuz I know plenty of you will be keen to
check those out as always we'll just go
for a quick trip down memory lane though
it won't be my memory because I didn't
test this process of previously so just
a quick history lesson than I suppose at
the Bloomfield and golf town processors
share the same LGA 1366 socket but the
newer 32 nanometer parts are a little
bit special in the sense that they pack
six cores in fact the core i7 980 X was
Intel's first ever six core desktop CPU
and if you imagine it being expensive
well you'd be right that sucker came in
at $1000 us back in early 2010 the six
cores operate at a base frequency of 3.3
you get hurt some boost to 3.6 u Hertz
depending on the workload although
designed to work with ddr3 1066 memory
well as possible to ramp with higher
memory speeds and given that the LGA
1366 socket was part of the Intel
high-end desktop platform at a time
triple channel memory support was
offered in favor of the more standard
dual channel memory operation so in
short the core i7 980 X was a based the
best desktop CPU money could buy
the only issue being as mentioned
earlier you needed a lot of money but
what I want to know is how well does it
stack up AES later to find out I'm gonna
compare it to a whole heap of modern
processors including the dinky little
$100 u.s. Rison 320 200 G now I don't
expect the 2200 G to be out of beat the
six core 12 thread core i7 processor
running at No
than three point three gigahertz after
all the 20 20 G is a fork or four thread
CPU that runs at a base frequency of
just 3.5 gigahertz has a little 4 mega
byte level 3 cache and packs a maximum
TDP of just 65 watts
oh yeah and did I mention the night e^x
is a 130 watt CPU still I'm interested
to see how 2010 s flagship desktop CPU
compares to 2018 s most affordable AMD
Rison CPU also thrown into the mix are
the 1st and 2nd generation rising 5 m
rise in 7 CPUs along with a few KB Lake
and coffee Lake CPUs as well the core i7
980 X has been benchmarked in its stock
out of the box trim as well as an
overclock configuration at 4.4 gigahertz
for the memory I have 6 2 gigabyte
sticks of ddr3 1600 memory and that's
the best stuff I have available for this
test so let's see how Intel's first ever
six core desktop CPU stacks up in 2018
first up we have the size software
memory bandwidth benchmark and here we
can clearly see the advantage of high
speed ddr4 memory the Rison 320 200 G
has almost 50% more memory bandwidth at
its disposal when compared to the triple
channel ddr3 1600 configuration of the
core i7 980 x with just 23 gigabytes per
second of memory bandwidth the 980 X
will be severely limited in memory
intensive workloads moving on to
Cinebench r15 which isn't particularly
memory sensitive here we see these six
core 12 thread 9 ATX does do reasonably
well that said the single core
performance is rather weak and
shockingly even at 4.4 gigahertz is well
down on what the 2200 g offers in fact
the single thread performance of the 980
X was 8% slower than that of the 22
energy and 17% slower
once the apu is overclocked still the
2200 GS 4 threads can't compete with the
old 12 threaded CPU at least in the
multi-threaded workload and it's up to
37% slower once both CPUs are
overclocked that said when compared to a
modern 6 core 12 thread reisen processes
such as the 2600 X the 980 X is 30%
slower actually 43% when comparing these
stock numbers next up we have the v-ray
benchmark and here we see the 980 X
looks
much slower than what you might expect
particularly given what we just saw in
testing with Cinebench the result
however is accurate and the reason why
the 980 X is so slow here is down to
it's complete lack of AVX instructions a
VX was introduced a year later with the
Sandy Bridge architecture
so the 980 X is going to lag behind
severely and workloads that take
advantage of AVX instructions and here
with v-ray we do have a perfect example
of this as the 980 X is only able to
match the 2,200 G a cpu with only a
third of the threads offered by the core
i7 processor still once overclocked the
980 X is able to edge out the 22 energy
that we're talking about a 7% reduction
in render time for what will likely be
double the power draw and we will look
at power consumption towards the end of
the video for now though let's move on
to video editing performance as we take
a look with PC mark 10 here the Rison 3
apu is able to beat the core i7 980 x
both stock and overclocked stock the AMD
CPU is 7% faster know that margin is
reduced once both CPUs are overclocked
the plucky little quad core was still 3%
faster the PC mark 10 gaming physics
test does take advantage of core heavy
processes and it doesn't use an
instruction set that's absent in the
older Core i7 model as a result the 980
X is able to match the core i5 8500 out
of the box and once overclocked actually
beats the 8480 600 k and even the 7700 K
that said it's still slower than the
Rison 5 1600 and much slower than the
new horizon 5 2600 models next up we
have the 7-zip file extraction test and
here the core i7 980 X does do very well
especially when compared to more modern
six core 12 thread processes like the
Rison 5 1600 as it was just 11% slower
that said once overclocked it was able
to match the stock rather than 5 2600 so
not a bad result but of course the rise
in CPUs can also be overclocked moving
on we have the corona performance and
again very respectable results here the
fourth row to Verizon 322 energy for
example is completely overwhelmed by the
older 6 core core i7 processor that said
blender is another application that
employs AVX instructions and like what
we saw with v-ray the core i7 9 ATX
really struggles due to its lack of AVX
support as
it's reduced to quad-core light
performance as it just matched the
horizon 322 energy overclocking did help
but even so it was well down on where
you might expect a 12 thread cpu running
at well over 4 gigahertz to be Hambrick
also runs a BX code and again we find
the 980 X is only able to deliver
quad-core that performance making it
significantly slower than a modern 6
chord 12 thread CPU now for some gaming
benchmarks and we see despite having
three times the threads a notable clock
speed advantage the 980 X isn't exactly
world's faster than the rise in 320 200
G sure it was 25% faster when
overclocked and that is certainly a
noteworthy margin but honestly I
expected a much more serious advantage
in a core heavy game that said we do see
the 980 X doing very well in battlefield
1 outpacing the 22 energy by a
convincing 36 percent margin and that is
once both CPUs are overclocked in fact
once overclocked to the 980 X isn't that
much slower than the risin 5 1600 orbea
stock risin 5 1600 but still not a bad
result
however most games aren't as core heavy
as battlefield 1 and ashes of the
singularity and we certainly see a good
example of that here when testing with
far cry 5 here the 2020 G was actually
8% faster than the 980 X been comparing
both CPUs stock performance overclocking
does put the 980 X back ahead but it was
still slower than the stock risin 5 1600
for example last up we have vermintide 2
and this title does scale quite well on
core heavy CPUs and as a result the 980
X was 25% faster than the 2200 G when
comparing overclocked results that said
it was still 18% slower than a very GPU
limited horizon 5 2600 okay time for
some total system power consumption
figures and please note these numbers
also include a gtx 1080 TI here we see
the rise in 322 energy system drawing up
to 315 watts from the wall while the
stock 980 X increased consumption by 55%
hitting 489 watts and again remember
that's entire system consumption which
makes the over 50% increase even more
shocking
then once overclocked the 980 X system
was sucking down 64 percent more power
than the overclocked 2200 G
now these are the truly scary numbers
full cpu load with very light GPU usage
now the stock 980 X system is drawing
93% more power than the 22 energy and
133 percent more once overclocked
getting back to the stock numbers the
980 X also consumed 30% more than the
2600 X so unsurprisingly the 8 year-old
CPU isn't very efficient by today's
standards well there you have it the
core i7 and 980 X compared to a number
of modern CPUs in 2018 has to be said if
it wasn't for the lack of AVX support
the 980 X would have looked much more
impressive in our application benchmarks
still when it came to gaming the results
weren't half bad especially when we look
at those 4.4 gigahertz results of course
power consumption was a bit atrocious it
has to be said though we are looking at
a 6 chord 12 thread CPU from 2010 using
the 32 nanometer process ignoring the
AVX workloads the 980 X out of the box
so that's before we overclock it
it was 37% faster than your Aizen 322
energy in Cinebench r15 s multi-threaded
test however it does pack 50% more cores
and then of course it does have hyper
threading which means it has three times
as many threads so a 37% increase in
multi-threaded score isn't particularly
impressive and that's because we see
these single thread performance was down
by 26% so that being the case the core
i7 and 980 X doesn't stack up nearly as
well to a modern six core 12 thread
processor and even the first-generation
Verizon 5 1600 had its way with intel's
first-ever 6 core desktop cpu the r5
1600 was 19% faster and Cinebench r15 s
multi-threaded tests and 25% faster in
games such as ashes of the singularity
again this test was really just a bit of
fun and served no real purpose it's
certainly not intended to be buying
advice the 980 X made little sense in
2010 and it certainly makes no sense in
2018 especially given the current asking
price which seems to be about $200 u.s.
that said there is a certain breed of PC
users that will be quick to point out
that you can get a Xeon
for much less and well that is true the
Z on X 56 75 for example can be
regularly had for around $80 us less
than half that of the 980 X these are
essentially the same six cord twelve
thread CPUs they even work on the same X
58 motherboards and can be overclocked
to similar frequencies and some of the
better chips will even do 4.5 gigahertz
the problem I have with these CPUs isn't
necessarily the CPUs themselves as we've
seen
despite some pretty horrendous power
figures their overall performance isn't
bad assuming you're not running software
that takes advantage your AVX in which
case it is bad besides that though the
big problem are the motherboards just
getting one can be hard enough but
getting one for a reasonable price is
near on impossible assuming you don't
want to spend every waking hour seeking
out a bargain though even then there
aren't really few to be had you're
looking at having to pony up around a
hundred to one hundred and fifty dollars
u.s. for an x58 motherboard and the
better examples the board's you're
actually going to want to use are much
closer to the one hundred and fifty
dollar US mark realistically you're
looking at around two hundred and thirty
dollars u.s. for a Xeon X 56 75 and x58
motherboard combo and then you'll also
need some ddr3 memory but that stuff's
much cheaper than ddr4 so that's
probably the biggest win for this combo
12 gigabytes looks to be about $70 us
about the same price as a gigabytes of
ddr4 so if we were to include 12
gigabytes of ddr3 memory that would push
the xeon bill out to about $300 u.s.
alternatively you could buy a risin 526
hundred four hundred and seventy dollars
u.s. a be 350 board for at $60 u.s. and
then eight gigabytes of ddr4 memory for
around $70 u.s. and that gives us a
grand total of $300 u.s. that being the
case i just find the risin 526 hundred
to make so much more sense stock you can
just pull the thing out of the box stick
it on the board
start the system up and it will just
smoke and overclocked x 56 75 so
personally i just no longer get the love
affair some people seem to have with
these old xeon cpus pre risin they were
great but unless you can get a CPU
motherboard and memory and combo for
well under $200 u.s. it's simply not
worth it at this point there's also a
number of sick
purity vulnerabilities on these
platforms that likely aren't going to
get patched so you'll just have to live
with those and if they do get patched
there will be some kind of performance
decline there so all that is worth
keeping in mind having said all that if
you would like me to compare the Xeon X
50 675 to say the risin 5 2600 nahi per
games then I can certainly make that
happen
let me know in the comment section below
if you want to see that happen I think I
said that at the start let's just move
on
actually let's just end the video I
think we're done I think I've said
everything that needs to be said so if
you liked the video you know what to do
subscribe for more videos just like this
one and if you want to support the
channel more directly check out our
patreon account you can gain access to a
discord chattin talk about old xeon
processors or new rising processes or
whatever you like there we will answer
any questions and we also do a monthly
live stream out to blast we did that
about a week ago so you just miss that
but you could go back and watch it I
suppose and then you can jump in the
next live stream next month and and yeah
feel like I'm this outro is going but
longer than it needs to so I think this
is the point where I say thank you for
watching I'm your host Steve and I will
see you again next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
