your host Matt and today for the first
exclusive look at new videos geforce gtx
980ti nvidia introduced the original
geforce 989 70 maxwell GPUs eight months
ago in September 2014 in January we saw
the release of the gtx 960 and of course
in march we met the monster that is the
titan x the type next took single GPU
performance and pricing to a whole other
level and despite coming in at a
whopping one thousand US dollars
recommended retail price the type next
sales demand still exceeded in the video
supply the new gtx 980ti it seems to aim
to bridge the gap both performance and
pricing wires between the original gtx
980 and the titan x and in a way it
seems to me to be sort of the sensible
version of the titan X with an IR R P is
649 US dollars if the performance is in
the same ballpark as the type next then
the video could be on to a winner with
this one let's quickly take a look at a
few technical differences the Titan X
featured a fully fledged 24 SM unit GM
200 comprising of 3072 CUDA cores the
new 980ti is reduced to 22 SM units and
2,816 caused where the Tyne X had a
massive 12 gigabytes of memory the 980ti
has 6 gigabytes this is still 2
gigabytes more than the original 980 and
quite frankly 12 gigabytes was pointless
and pretty unnecessary 6 gigabytes is
going to be plenty for gamers to run the
latest triple-a titles at 4k without
having to worry about running low on
memory the base clock speed of the gtx
980ti is a thousand megahertz and the
typical boost clock speed is a thousand
and seventy-five megahertz both of these
matched the Titan X Nvidia tells us that
as it is a gaming enthusiast card the
980 T is designed for overclocking and
uses a six phase power supply with over
voltage in capability and an additional
two phase power suppliers dedicated for
the board's gddr5 memory now there are
three main technologies
County on to push sales of high end GPU
such as the gtx 980ti
Microsoft will be releasing DirectX 12
later this year which will reduce CPU
overhead and enable new features such as
volume tiled resources 4k gaming is
another big one up to this point the
Titan X was really the only card that
could deliver playable performance on
the latest triple-a titles at 4k virtual
reality is the other main technology
that's expected to drive PC gaming in
the near future and the video at the
moment seems to dominate this field with
all that said let's get to the good part
let's go on benchmark this card and see
how it performs our first benchmark is
Crysis 3 the 980ti average 50 frames per
second at 1600 P making it 40% faster
than the Radian 290x
27% faster than the original gtx 980 and
impressively just 7% slower than the
tight next at 4k the 980 TI delivered
just 28 trains per second the
performance margins remain the same
compared to the titan x and gtx 980 the
980 TI was now 47% faster than the i9
290x in battlefield 4 the 980 TI was a
negligible 1% slower than the titan x at
1600 feet and 5% slower at 4k while it
was 30% faster than the GTX 980 both the
resolutions and even faster than the r9
290x in battlefield hardline the 980 TI
delivered playable performance of 4k
using two times MSA 8 which was awesome
it was just 6% slower than the Titan X
and was also 26 percent faster than the
original 980
and 38 percent faster than the r9 290x
in dying light the gtx 980ti gave us 38
frames per second at 4k making attempts
and slower than the titan x meanwhile it
was 23% faster than the GTX 980 and 41
percent faster than the r9 290x we
tested The Witcher 3 using ultra quality
settings which means Nvidia hair works
was fully enabled the 980 TI averaged an
impressive 51 frames per second at 1600
P
and thirty frames per second at 4k
whereas just six percent slower than the
type next and 36 percent faster than the
GTX 980 and the r9 290x Grand Theft Auto
5 fans will be wrapped 980ti delivered a
very playable 44 frames per second at 4k
again just 60 percent slower than the
type next well being 22% faster than the
GTX 980 and 33% faster than the r9 290x
the release of the gtx 980ti is $650
sees the original gtx 980 dropped down
from an r RP of $550 to an even 500 the
tight neck still remains at a thousand
US dollars
considering the 980 TI is $350 cheaper
the only sacrifice is around 8 percent
performance when compared to the tight
necks it represents pretty excellent
high-end value the Radeon r9 290x is
still fantastic value between 3 and 350
dollars however if you are planning on
4k gaming you will require two cards
overall nvidia geforce gtx 980ti is an
excellent high end GPU solution and in
my opinion at its current price point
the time next has been rendered kind of
redundant thanks for watching this
exclusive first look in benchmark of the
980 TI let me know what you think in the

we'll see you on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
