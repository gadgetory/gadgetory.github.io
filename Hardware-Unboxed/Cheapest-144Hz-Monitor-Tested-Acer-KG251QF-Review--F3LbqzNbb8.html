tap the bell welcome back to hardware on
box today we're looking at the cheapest
high refresh rate monitor you can
currently get in Australia at least
through a favorite retailer PC case gear
you guys been asking for more budget
model content so today thanks to PC
Casey and ASA we're looking at something
very affordable the monitor in question
is the ASIC kg to five 1qf which retails
for $2.99
ozzie dollars when and if this monitor
comes to the US it should cost just two
hundred dollars or so which is right at
the bottom end of pricing to this kind
of monitor the right now it is available
in Europe as well for a great price so
yeah it is a highly affordable budget
monitor for this price the KZ 250 1qf
provides a twenty four point five inch
1080p
T and LCD panel with a maximum refresh
rate of 144 hurts that 144 Hertz refresh
rate is the key thing here you can get
1080p monitors for less than 300 or zero
or 200 u.s. but you won't find many or
anything that provide 144 Hertz for less
so if you really want to get into high
frame rate high refresh gaming and you
only have a few hundred to spend this is
the best option so what does 200 bucks
get you well as I mentioned it is a
pretty basic ten-pound it's on the
smaller size for modern displays and it
is just 1080p all of that is pretty much
a given at this sort of price point it
does pack freezing support though which
is great for AMD GPU owners and it has
low frame rate compensation so you get
adaptive sync throughout the entire
refresh range and the kg 250 1qf
shouldn't be confused with the older k
g2 v 1q which is effectively the same
monitor just with a 75 Hertz refresh
rate if you want the full 140-foot Hertz
refresh and LFC you'll need to look out
for the k g2 v 1q f confusingly there's
also a new k2 20 v 1q with a 240 hertz
refresh rate so just double check the
spec sheet before you buy as aces
monitor naming scheme is pretty
confusing most of the time I'm going to
talk more about space
and calibration a bit later in this
review so first let's take a look at the
design as this is a budget monitor I
wasn't really expecting much so it's no
real surprise that Acer has delivered a
pretty basic build here it looks decent
for a cheap motor if I'm honest they're
almost all of the exterior is built
using plastic including the stand you're
not gonna get that premium finish here
any crazy game elements like RGB mood
lighting though thanks to some metal
reinforcing the entire build is quite
sturdy ASA did deliver in one important
area and that's bezel size the top and
sides are just six point five
millimeters thick which is in line with
most modern monitors and will be great
for those looking to create a
multi-monitor setup however the stand is
thoroughly inflexible and extremely
basic supporting just tilt adjustment no
high no swivel and no pivot adjustments
can be made these features are left a
more premium monitor designs for
connectivity we have hdmi displayport
and DVI inputs and there's also a couple
of audio jacks both for input to the
internal speakers and output from hdmi
displayport to headphones or other audio
devices the included jewel for what
speakers are rubbish so I wouldn't
consider using them seriously for even
one second but that's not exactly
unusual for built-in monitor speakers
unfortunately to access the on-screen
menu you'll have to suffer through the
torture of non directional controls at
least the buttons are on the front of
the monitor so you can actually see what
you're pressing but no d-pad makes and
navigating and changing settings a bit
of a chore I guess d-pad controls is
something restricted to high-end
monitors at this point in any case
there's nothing overly exciting in the
on-screen controls apart from all the
usual stuff you're used to seeing in
modern monitors in fact it looks like
everything from Asus high-end gaming
monitors is in here including cheap
crosshairs low blue light modes adaptive
contrast multiple presets and more if
you're moving from just a 60 Hertz
display to 144 Hertz for the first time
the difference is seriously enormous for
gaming especially if your system is good
enough to push frame rates into the high
end of the Refresh window games seem
more fluid and more responsive and the
and clarity of a high refresh increases
the amount of perceptible detail during
fast motion scenes when you're pushing
or above 100 FPS on a high refresh
monitor it's simply a better way to game
and moving back to 60 FPS on a 60 Hertz
monitor can feel sluggish in comparison
high refresh rates are definitely not a
gimmick and in my opinion it's worth the
extra cost if you can't afford it
there is some debate about whether you
need adaptive sync at high refresh rate
so I tend to find it more useful in the
sub 75 FPS range so if you're gaming at
those sort of frame rates you will get a
better experience with an AMD GPU as it
can actually make use of free sync with
the kg2 5 1qf but if you have an NVIDIA
GPU I still think this display is a
great option as equivalent g-sync
monitors a fair bit more expensive if
you're running games at high frame rates
it's not a significant loss and you'll
still be getting the benefits of a high
refresh rate this monitor uses a TN
panel so it has all the usual strengths
and weaknesses of this panel type
response time is a very good rated at
one millisecond greater grain from what
I could see motion blur and ghosting
aren't a problem especially with
overdrive enabled viewing angles though
are quite weak especially vertically
which tends to be a major issue with TN
panels of course it's fine when you're
viewing the panel from straight on the
kg to 5 1qf provides a level of
brightness that exceeds aces
specifications I measured around 458
nits of peak brightness using the
default calibration while Asus suggests
a brightness of 400 nits so that's not a
bad start for this monitor I don't
actually recommend using the monitor at
4:15 it's but brightness does tend to be
a strength of 10 panels asa doesn't list
a proper contrast ratio for this display
instead opting for a garbage adaptive
contrast figure which they give as 100
million to one in actual fact most TN
panels are sub 1000 to 1 and that's the
case with this monitor a contrast ratio
of 929 to one that only dips slightly
when brightness is reduced this is down
to a relatively high black level though
I wouldn't necessarily describe the
panel's having a backlight bleed issue
rather the entire panel just can't block
out the backlight fully again that's a
common issue for budget TN panels
uniformity is the worst aspect of this
displays performance and that's really
the major difference between a budget
monitor like the kg 250 1qf and
something higher-end
there are clearly areas that are
brighter than others and it doesn't
really require a measurement like this
to spot them that said the center to
edge Delta e value is as large as 5.0 in
some areas which indicates a visually
noticeable difference and keep in mind
this is a relatively small monitor which
makes uneven backlighting stand out more
that said you aren't likely to notice
the uniformity issues while gaming its
most noticeable when viewing largely
solid colors in desktop and productivity
apps so that's just something to keep
aware of default color performance isn't
amazing by any stretch a scissor did
target a correct white color temperature
of 6,500 K and we get reasonably close
with just a slight green tint however
they forgot to calibrate the rest of the
grayscale range there is a noticeable
yellow tint to grays and poor gamma with
a grayscale Delta a average of 5.3 to
saturation performance is mediocre
though a Delta II average of 3.88 isn't
the worst I've seen and considering this
is a budget panel we could be getting a
lot worse straight out of the box
it's definitely pleasing to see 97.7%
srgb coverage some budget displays can't
produce the full srgb gama so at least
the top-end of colors will be well
saturated within the bounds of srgb
color checker results show an average
delta T of 4.75 with the highest DS in
skin tones and Red's which matches with
the overall slight yellow tint this
monitor provides in its default State
I'll also show the luminance sweeps here
which you can see the largest deviance
from accurate in the low luminance range
where the K G 2 v 1q F is particularly
loose the good news is the K G 251 QF is
calibration friendly both there just
on-screen display controls and using
external Hardware tweaking settings
using the OSD controls won't get you
perfect results but you can achieve
tighter Delta ears across the board
using the settings as you can see here
of course there will be some deviants
among all models of this monitor but
these are the sayings that worked best
for me this tightened up the grayscale
Delta II average from five point four
six to two point nine though it doesn't
correct the yellow tint or gamma problem
fully in fact the other available gamma
settings just make the issue worse
saturation improves from three point
nine three to two point four for a
decent gain and Colour check it comes in
from four point seven five to three
point two
it doesn't make the display super
accurate but it is an important
improvement that you can get without any
other hardware one thing I should note
is calibration does reduce the contrast
ratio down to about seven thirty to one
which is getting to a pretty low value
at this point I'm not surprised to see
this behavior from a TN panel and it
does remain one of the weakest aspects
to this technology luckily if you fully
calibrate the kg 250 1qf you can achieve
great results using spectra Cal's
Kalman v average Delta ease with sub 1.0
in every test gamma was corrected the
CCT average is nee perfect and even the
luminance sweeps are tightened up a fair
bit there is still some looseness in
performance near the bottom end of the
luminance and grayscale range but that's
just a nitpick and we are just talking
about a budget display here if you're
interested in using the software profile
I created for my kg 2 5 1qf with your kg
2 5 1 qf if you decide to buy one that
will be available through our patreon
page I get asked from time to time to
provide these profiles and I think it
makes a nice bonus for those that
support us through patreon thanks to all
that do keep in mind no two monitors are
identical so my profile might not be as
accurate as it could be for your monitor
but it should be world's better than the
default profile head over to patreon
compound one box to download the profile
if you want so all up I'm impressed with
the ASIC 8250 1qf it's always a bit of a
gamble with budget monitors or really
any budget product and sometimes you get
a steaming pile of crap
however this modeling is not crap at all
into rivers great specs especially the
refresh rate at an awesome price
performance out of the box isn't amazing
but it responds well to calibration and
the only major issues are typical TN
grievances like low contrast ratio some
poor viewing angles and uneven
backlighting the design and build is
basic but it does the job I quite easily
recommend this budget monitor
considering what it provides for just
$300 readers or around 200 us it's
really good value for money and you'd be
hard-pressed to find a better monitor
without spending a lot more for an IPS
or VA display and the great you see is
there is a very similar 27-inch variant
the cagey 271 a that's available for
only 306
nine Australian dollars if you wanted a
larger panel while I haven't tested that
specific model yet it has a really
attractive price point as well in
keeping with aces aggressive targeting
of the budget market that's it for this
review of the ASIC a g25 1qf don't
