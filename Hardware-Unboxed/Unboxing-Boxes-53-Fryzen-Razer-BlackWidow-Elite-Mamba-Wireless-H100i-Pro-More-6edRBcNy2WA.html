another episode of unboxing boxes as you
can see we have the usual assortment of
packages to get into so we'll do that
now and as you probably notice my voice
hasn't fully recovered yet either so
that's been a slow painful process still
got a bit of a scratchy voice but anyway
I thought why not do an unboxing boxes
anyway they're only like 40 minutes long
and I talked the whole time so that's a
perfect thing to do well I'm trying to
get my voice back so got my trusty knife
and we'll get this little guy out of the
way and we'll start with the biggest
package we have here which is this
package yeah it is uh quite heavy and
I'm not gonna set sure who this one's
from it's got a rip in the bottom anyway
we'll just tear the bag off this one
looks like it's a razor product okay now
we can unbox the box we had to unwrap
the Box first
quite complicated I have no idea how to
go about opening this one and I've done
it upside down raise the level cap okay
let's raise the level caps all about
I never was very good at raising the
level cap I'll get there done that's
pretty cool
I'll set that there for now so nice bit
of foam oh okay I'm gonna help I got to
show you guys this so it looks like we
have and you raise a keyboard mouse and
headset let's find out what they are
well the mumble Wireless looks like we
have a new Kraken headset and finally a
really heavy solid feeling keyboard
we'll talk about the moment okay I think
we'll just get this giant box out of the
way we'll start with the cable and this
is the new Black Widow elite it has a
magnetic wrist rest
that's very plush very nice and cushy
there I like that so the magnetic
refreshed snaps into place really nicely
it doesn't it kind of holds there when
you move it forward but it's not strong
enough that it really holds on it lets
go sometimes so up in the top right hand
corner here we can see some nice
dedicated multimedia keys and there's a
dial here as well which you can use to
quickly control things like the volume
and it also has a big mute button in the
middle so that's very nice and I noticed
on this end we have some pass-through
USB and audio pass-through which makes
sense as we have a headphone jack here
and an extra USB so it's good to see
some pass throughs you can plug things
in like your headphones just on the edge
there nice quick easy stick your headset
on and away you go now apparently using
razor's synapses three software every
key on this keyboard can be customized
going programmed to do some sort of
alternate function so that's very cool
and there are three switch choices so
you've got the Razer mechanical switches
the green orange and yellow and on my
particular model I have the green
switches it's quite a heavy solid
keyboard there's definitely no flex very
little flex in this thing so you're not
going
easily break it it's a plastic backing I
believe yet all the surroundings plastic
and just because it's so much colder
than the rest of it it looks like it's
an aluminium sort of shroud over the top
of it
be a really nice clean looking keyboard
this I like it a lot extremely
comfortable for those of you wondering
it is $170 us for the keyboard or $300
Australian so a pricey item but it the
build quality seems very good great
feature set so yeah another great
mechanical keyboard then we have the new
Kraken headset and razer says these are
the world's first gaming headsets to
support spatial or THX spatial audio
basically that means you have a wider
soundscape and more accurate audio
positioning so interested to see how
that goes I'll probably give that a go
in battlefield 5 maybe fortnight tonight
have a couple of rounds and yeah see
what I make of them I liked the I've
liked all the crack and headsets that
I've tried on so far and these are no
exception they're very comfortable
they're not super tight on your head
which I suppose is good for long gaming
sessions they do float around a bit when
I shuffle not when I look quite quickly
not that you do a lot of that when you
gave me I suppose you look just at your
screen but if you do happen to look
around I mean they hang on yeah they
don't fall off my head anyway
particularly easily so yeah they're
comfortable but the real test obviously
is when you wear them for a few hours of
gaming some headsets tend to give me a
headache so I will try these out tonight
and see how they go but of course that
is a sort of personal preference thing
so one headset won't necessarily suit
all we've got an out there's an
aluminium sort of a frame that runs
through the top of the headband so that
makes them very strong and that connects
directly to the cans and the cans
themselves are aluminium as well now so
plenty of aluminium on this should be
very durable
really nice build quality here standard
retractable mica believe that's exactly
the same mic that was on the previous
model but that slides in and out really
nicely then we have a braided cable here
that comes down to an analog control
which you can use to increase or
decrease the volume of the headset on
the fly and there's also a mic mute
button then that comes down to a 4-pole
3.5 millimeter audio jack and that can
go into like I said the keyboard there
so that works really nicely with the
keyboard or your computer or your phone
or tablet or whatever it is that you're
using them with laptop alternatively if
you want to use that spatial audio you
can plug it into this little USB adapter
here obviously that connects to your
computer via a USB and that allows you
to adjust things like the base and then
take advantage of those thx capabilities
so again very keen to try that out as
well and see how much difference that
makes this also has a mute button though
this is digital so you might have to
make sure that this one is enabled to
use this one if it's disabled here then
you can't enable it from here so that's
something to be aware of but you'd
probably work that out pretty quickly
apart from the upgraded sort of housing
for the ear cups we get this nice bit of
aluminium here Razer says that the
drivers have also been updated so that's
the speakers in the ear cups so they've
been improved for better frequency
greater frequency range but apparently
that makes them a little less bassy
but you can sort of tune the bass with
the USB adapter so yeah again I haven't
tried them out yet very keen to give
them a go and I'll report back and let
you guys know what I make of them and
then the item that I am most interested
in is the mumbo wireless mouse so the
previous wireless version required a
special mouse pad to work this is your
more standard wireless mouse that will
work on any mouse pad or surface and it
works via a USB dongle which is probably
in the bottom of the mouse and yes it is
so you've got a wireless dongle here you
can turn the mouse on and off
which there is a connect button that'll
obviously go into your PC now you could
plug into your keyboard though it's
probably not really an ideal spot but it
would work oh and before I should move
on to the mouse I should just know that
the headset is $100 u.s. or a hundred
and seventy Australian dollars which
seems very reasonable for a headset of
that quality and to avoid forgetting the
mouse is also $100 u.s. or a hundred and
seventy Australian which again for a
high-quality wireless mouse seems very
reasonable and I like the Logitech G 902
that I'm currently using I will swap it
out for this later today and give this a
good test drive but like that it can
also be used as a wired mouse so you've
got a little micro USB connector there
and you can plug that in the cable is
probably floating in the box that I've
thrown off to my side there so I won't
dig that out at the moment but yeah
really nice looking Mouse and it's
surprisingly light for a wireless mouse
quite shocked by how light it is I've
got a few other Wireless mice floating
around and they're much heavier I think
from memory to that 108 grams don't
quote me on that but it's around 100
grand mark anyway and it certainly feels
like it the key feature of this Mouse is
that it does feature raises 5g advanced
optical sensor and that supports up to
16,000 DP I was gonna say 6000 dpi
16,000 dpi they offer 50 million clicks
for the main clickers so you can do
plenty of clicking I have a reasonably
biggish hand it's not huge it's not it's
just above-average let's say and it fits
on this Mouse really comfortably I can
use the bigger mice without a problem
but this is yeah really comfortable it's
probably similar to size-wise to the
Logitech mouse that I'm using a little
bit shorter maybe I'm not sure on that
it feels really nice in total there's 7
programmable buttons and probably the
coolest feature about this mouse is that
raids are advertising a 50 hour battery
life on a single charge so that's
definitely a claim I want to put to the
test 50 hours is very impressive
so we'll see if that's possible now
finally if you're wondering what the
raise the level cap is all about
basically it's a marketing thing but
Razer are suggesting that these three
products go together very well and if
you use them
together it will raise your level cap so
basically make you better at gaming so
that's something all gamers would like
to be able to but purchase some some
better gaming performance not sure if
it'll make you a better gamer but it
certainly won't hurt so yeah anyway I
will plug all three of these into my
gaming system tonight hopefully play a
few rounds of whatever my mates want to
play tonight and I'll see how good they
are so yeah anyway very good Thank You
Razer for sending that stuff over I'm
keen to give it a go and see what it's
all about okay my voice is sort of
hanging in there I'll open up this box
we'll see what's in here I think this
one I think yes this one has been sent
in by a patreon member and they tried to
hide who they were but I've worked it
out because their name was under the
shipping label to me so I know this is
used ads at our Hardy I know you have
sent me something and because it's you I
know this will be interesting if you
guys recall Zed Zed are Hardy sent me
some interesting Asian drinks for an
episode a few episodes ago now that was
a lot of fun I don't know what he has
sent me this time but we're going to
find out in a moment could it be
anything what am I looking at here paper
more paper
oh boy this is looking like an
interesting assortment of items so we
have some kind of t-shirt that looks
interesting
okay well stuff is pillow thing I don't
know what this is all about maybe there
was something said in the discord chat I
don't recall but he sent me some I
suppose anime type thing I'm not really
up with with that stuff but anyway so
that's what I've been sent so very
comfortable it's making the unboxing
experience much more comfortable we'll
put that over to the side here for the
moment so we have an XL size t-shirt so
good thing you know is my size I'm a
large but XL or work I feel like there's
a jerk here or something I'm not
understanding but anyway I won't put
that on I'll put it over here I've got a
mug I have no idea what any of this
stuff is or what it's about you guys are
all gonna be probably shaking your head
at me but cool thank you
and another mug some characters from
something I don't know
thank you very much okay so that's the
stuff from patreon members Ed's at our
Hardy and I probably haven't done that
justice moving on we're going to box
around the back here I'll get there the
way it says Corsair on it so well check
that out could be a power supply it
could be some memory storage cooling
stuff actually did release and you only
want a liquid cooler I think this is it
and I've done it backwards haven't I
yep so we have the new Hydra H 100 I Pro
RGB of course it's RGB I would have been
very disappointed if it wasn't so this
is the 240 millimeter version of the 280
millimeter H 115 I Pro which we've
already looked at I believe I have
tested on the channel we featured it in
a few builds and now we have this model
so I am doing quite a bit of cooler
testing at the moment but it is on
thread Ripper so I don't think I will be
testing this in that particular roundup
though I could anyway we'll see let me
know if you wanna see how this goes on
the 2990 WX if it supports that it
probably does I don't know where's a
listed compatibility where are you I
don't know I'll work that out later
anyway we have the new Corsair cooler so
that'll be it's pretty much a mid-range
cooler though it should work well on
your core i7s and stuff like that your
eyes and seven 2700 X a lot sort of
stuff price-wise hundred and twenty
dollars us works out to be about 190
dollars Australian so definitely up
there a premium 240 millimeter or liquid
cooler actually before I move on I just
did a quick search on my phone and it is
tr4 compatible so I could just a
thorough pitched CPUs and I will
probably do just that the war
has a copper cold plate the radiator is
a fully aluminum radiator and yet
supports all latest platforms in
addition a Tier four so you have a m4
and then all the current Intel platforms
so you can pretty much throw it on
anything alright moving right along
which ones actually I'll grab it grab
this box here because I think I know
what this is we can just quickly get
through this one yes this is a package
I've been waiting for for a while it's
actually nice to get the retail
packaging for this I don't know how many
people have got these in their retail
packaging but it is the mighty Wraith
Ripper I've already featured the wraith
Ripper on unboxing boxes it was out of
the AMD review kit for the 2950 x in the
twenty nine ninety WX so I've been using
that cooler
absolutely brilliant cool love it but I
want to do a build and use the Wraith
Ripper I don't want to take away the one
on my test system and I want one for
personal use so I asked Coolermaster if
they'd be kind enough to send over to
Ray through four coolers and as you can
see they've complied to say we've got
two Wraith Reapers in brand new retail
packaging I'll take the plastic awesome
and in that tr4 a cooler comparison that
I'm currently working on I have already
tested the wraith ripper so those
results will be there yeah so the Wraith
Reaper is made by Cooler Master
Coolermaster pretty much make all the
AMD box coolers it's not an AMD box
cooler but it's kind of the official you
know thread Ripper cooler the Wraith
Ripper they're very cool name cool
cooler that's a big huge chunk of
aluminium alright we'll get this little
package out of the way next
ah we have what looks to be some ddr4
memory the new Ballistix sport memory
from crucial or micron says by micron
but crucial will probably be selling its
base to the same company and it looks
like we have four sticks so for 8
gigabyte sticks 32 gigabyte kit and it
is ddr4 3000 so 1.3 5 volt pretty
standard stuff and it's their alliance
gaming so that is actually the tough
Alliance gaming so this is I've got some
from Tim group that we did for that
tough build but this is the soos tough
themed stuff so there we go four sticks
of tough Ballistix sport ddr4 memory oh
uh I'll try and do you out a tough
motherboard and I'll Chuck this on you
so you can get a look at it in its
natural environment yeah pretty pretty
cool looking memory no fancy RGB nasaw
ran out sort of stuff so I don't expect
it to be too expensive
I think it's selling for a hundred and
eighty dollars u.s. right now for the 32
gigabyte and do ya for three thousand
kick I don't believe it is available in
Australia yet and yeah for those of you
interested you can actually bite on the
crucial website at the moment there's
quite a few different capacities and
configurations available those speeds do
only include ddr4 2666 and ddr4 3000 as
they're probably targeting sort of like
your h3 70 type tough motherboards so a
lot of them are locked or have a limited
memory support anyway some cool looking
memory there and hopefully I got around
to showing you how it looks on a tough
motherboard so hopefully the b-roll
looks good okay two packages left we've
got this little one here it's getting to
that so it's a very heavy little package
so no idea what that could be
ah here's another cool one yet another
cooler so what do we have here the deep
cool gamax GT have I seen this cooler
before maybe not I'm not sure about that
but it's an am full cool doesn't list
any tier 4 compatibility but usually
they're fairly custom the tr4
air coolers but you can use it on your
Rison 2nd gen rising our first
generalising so any AM for motherboard
basically and it looks like it supports
every single one of intel's current
desktop platforms but you know i won't
dig that out and go into it I'm not a
homosexual why deep cool has set this
cooler over but yeah I'll find out in
time I'm sure and the last package we
have which is kind of an audit shaped
package not sure what that's all about
yeah be interesting I'm not sure how to
tackle this one ok it's looking like
it's another one from deep cool no clues
yet but I saw the jet call our logo
oh yes oh that is perfect timing because
this can be used in that TR for cooler
and Paris on top of that it is frozen
yay
how much it's a heavy cooler I'm trying
out my hands on this for a little while
now ever since I saw it at Computex this
cooler we will take out of the box and
have a good look at but yeah like I said
it's one I've been trying to get my
hands on for a while why don't we go
yeah is that just how do we rip that
apart there's a tab here I think they
must break it it comes off I think this
is working as well as it's meant to okay
oh there's a tab at the end I went the
wrong way I'm an idiot fail on that one
it probably works better if I pulled it
around the way you meant to go so yeah
anyway that's fail out of the way it
pops open like that that's kind of cool
and then we've got that pops off that's
cool so I've did that right at least and
then we have the frozen so mounting gear
there so it's a quite a narrower cooler
which is great for memory compatibility
and you can easily access so that's the
problem with the wraith ripper it's a
nice big massive awesome cooler but it
does sorta well i'm not a hundred cents
sure i don't want to say it limits
memory compatibility because i haven't
tried it with a huge amount of modules
yet but what it does do is the modules
closest to the socket on the left and
right side extremely difficult to access
because the cooler kind of comes out
over them so that makes it very
difficult to get them in and out and
sometimes you can't without removing the
cooler first thankfully it is very quick
and easy to remove but anyway that
entire issue is completely avoided with
this cooler because it's only about as
wide as the cpu socket i've got a thread
ripper cpu here don't drop it
as luck would have it so
you can imagine if that's the size of a
thread Ripper CPU and you put that there
there's not much overhang from the
socket
probably basically none from the actual
socket so those of you wondering is big
beefy air cooler is about a hundred
dollars us I think I saw 105 on Amazon
and it works out 20 135 Australian so
that's a really good price there and
yeah given the design and the name that
we'll talk more about the name in a
moment
it is designed specifically for these
thread rivet processors and it was
designed with the new second gen thread
Ripper processors in mind so you get a
hundred percent tr4 coverage so again
there's the base of the cooler hopefully
you can see that quite well and there's
the top of the CPU so as you can see it
is indeed 100% coverage of course you
get other important features like RGB
lighting though it's not just all about
the flashiness of this cooler it's quite
well constructed obviously we've got
plenty of heat pipes important stuff
like that but also this frame on the fan
that is made of aluminium so it's not
plastic there's just been painted to
look sort of metallic it's actually
aluminium so very durable and then you
go back to the all-important heat pipes
there are six heat pipes and they are
dual length heat pipes so they run
through the full stack of fins up then
through the base plate the nickel plated
copper base plate then they wind back
through the fins again so plenty of heat
dissipation from the base up into the
fins for this 120 millimeter fan to then
cool the fins yeah really nice looking
cooler this one and I'm keen to give it
a go it's got a unique looking fin
design as well plenty of heat pipes all
that good stuff and then of course deep
cool has in their infinite wisdom
decided to call it
horizon which yeah a lot of people that
stir it up a lot of fuss at Computex
people who couldn't actually tell if it
was like some sort of joke because it
doesn't really make sense to make a
cooler that sort of the implication
there is that it fries your rise in CPU
so a very very strange choice though
it's possibly a stroke of
genius because the the kind of cheeky
odd surprising name generated a lot of
headlines and a lot of attention for
deep cool so maybe it was a success I
haven't done I have good sales have been
but we'll see how well it performs if
it's worth buying and we'll go from
there and then lastly we don't really
need to dig into this one too much I'll
throw up some b-roll of it because I've
already got it so that won't be too much
extra worker there but this is I got
this one because I will be benchmarking
it so that you'll see a proper review on
this it's not just an unboxing actually
most of the products we've got in this
episode will be featured on the channel
and they'll be proper data and opinions
given on them but this is the 280
millimeter version of the castle so we
got the 240 millimeter version
originally which I've already tested it
did a superb job of cooling the horizon
7 and 2,700 X now we've given that away
now so that cool is gone that was in a
PC that I recently gave away a rise in 7
2700 PC with 32 gigs of RAM rode on
Eric's 580 anyway a guy named Jared won
it and he's over the moon so if you're
watching this Jared congratulations for
those of you that missed out on that and
are hoping to win another PC well we'll
do some more giveaways and you'll get
your chance anyway out and off your win
but you can try something I won't dig
this one out and get into it because
we've already gone over the 240
millimeter wank or quite a bit of detail
this is just a slightly bigger radiator
the block and all that sort of stuff is
exactly the same so you'll see a review
on that very soon and you'll see it
tested alongside the frozen so those
two'll be tested I'll probably throw the
Corsair cooler into that you'll see the
wraith Ripper for sure because I've
already done that testing and then we've
got the game ax GT which i think is a
really good value air cooler for a m4
and Intel processors so not for not 40i4
so it won't be in that coverage then
sends it out Hardy sent me some really
unusual things not sure what that's all
about
I'll no doubt find out the discord chat
after this
episode we are sorry for not doing
whatever that is justice sorry mate and
yeah I'm going to head upstairs now to
my office and I am gonna connect up all
this razor gear and give it a good go
and I'll let you guys know what I think
of it but I'm really keen to give them
mouse a shot Tim loves his razor my she
has a few of them he uses them for his
laptop testing he's a big fan so
hopefully I will be too
as I test out the emember wireless
anyway big thank you to raise em for
sending that gear over very cool liked
their little unboxing care package the
but raise the level cap sort of lid
thing's really cool after find somewhere
to stick that in the studio oh yeah but
this ended up pretty much being the
cooler Edition we got three four five
six coolers I think that's a record for
unboxing boxes in terms of coolers
anyway I did struggle through this one a
bit so I apologize for that but I had to
get this one done I couldn't really wait
any longer my voice is still sucking but
anyway hopefully it won't be too much
longer and hopefully you guys didn't
mind this episode of unboxing boxes too
much I know it wasn't as animated as I
normally am but I had to unbox this
stuff because I have tests you know
doing the testing is more important than
the unboxing but I like to share you
know showing you guys the stuff as I get
it and I know a lot of you guys do like
watching it what have you been hassling
me to do this series so here's another
episode done and my voice is close to
running out so if you liked the video

more content and I will catch you on the
channel again very soon with lots of
benchmarking and all that good stuff
