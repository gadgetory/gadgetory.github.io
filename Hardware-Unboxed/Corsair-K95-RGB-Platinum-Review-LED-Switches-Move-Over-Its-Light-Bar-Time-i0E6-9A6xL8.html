video we have a review a review of a
product that's best in its class apart
with an unfair advantage and a product
for hardcore gamers yes these are all
the things Coursera claiming the new k95
RGB Platinum keyboard is and as the
company's new flagship keyboard Corsair
claims that they are taking things to
the next level sounds exciting not
convinced that the original k95 RGB
model was the best keyboard they could
produce Corsair has set out to upgrade
their flagship model once again
basically pretty much everything has
been tweaked or upgraded and as you've
probably guessed so too has the price
Coursera slapped on a $200 MSRP so
that's almost a 20 percent premium over
the previous model so what are some of
the highlights that make this keyboard
with such a high asking price Corsair
claims that the k95 RGB platinum will go
the distance and survive the most
intense gaming sessions thanks to a
highly durable lightweight aircraft
grade anodized brushed aluminium frame
that said while no doubt tough the
keyboard isn't exactly light at a little
over 1.3 kilograms
without a doubt the most eye-catching
feature on display is the light edge a
19 zone independently controlled light
bar running along the top edge of the
keyboard adding to the wow factor are
some very impressive lighting effects
that can be set independently from the
key Kappa lighting so while the main key
caps can be used to showcase the
dazzling spiral rainbow animations the
top light bar can be used to showcase a
the visor animation for example another
cool feature is the eight megabyte
profile storage with Hardware macro and
lighting playback the K 95 RGB platinum
also utilizes a low powered but very
capable 32-bit processor this technology
is called Hardware macro and lighting
playback which allows the end user to
save any backlighting effects even the
most complicated and multi level in-game
macros to be saved to the onboard memory
and played back without the need of any
external software helping to better take
advantage of the upgraded lighting are
some new keycaps Corsair has used a new
and more modern font which allows more
light to shine through
which enhances the effect of course you
still get 100% cherry MX switches and
Corsair is using that patented speed RGB
which feature a blistering fast 1.2
millimeter actuation these switches
require 45 grams of actuation force and
typically take 4 milliseconds to actuate
down the left-hand side of the keyboard
Corsair is placed half a dozen
programmable G keys for in-game macros
these keys feature contoured and
textured key caps which look and feel
quite nice around the back you'll find a
single USB pass-through port which I
feel is an essential feature of any
high-end keyboard this provides a
convenient way to plug in your mouse or
USB headset thankfully Corsi is
supplying the k95 RGB platinum with a
detachable wrist rest and here we find a
bit of a twist the rest features a
double sided rubber insert offering a
soft and hard side depending on the
users preference impressively this wrist
rest insert is also magnetized and this
allows it to quickly align itself and
snap into place the rubberized material
also makes it very comfortable and this
makes the K 95 RGB platinum a pleasure
to use here is a quick example of the
keyboard in use moving on all the
essential dedicated multimedia controls
are present and this includes an awesome
volume scroll wheel compared to the
previous model a scroll wheel is now
much larger and smoother in operation
the four media control buttons are now
also raised higher for better access and
visibility like previous models Corsair
has also included a set of textured and
contoured key caps for FPS and mobile
gamers finally around the back we find
some useful cable management features
along with four large rubber pads and a
pair of legs to tilt the keyboard
upwards software wise the K 95 RGB
platinum is supported by the CUA or
course a utility engine which is both
powerful and easy to use the software
allows gamers to create actions such as
double macros remappable key assignments
timer countdowns DPI adjustments and
more the software will also allow a
gamers to create multiple color profiles
as well as different modes that will
enable separate lighting and action
configurations based on the game or
application users will also be able to
export
poor profiles to share with one another
having used the k70 RGB rapid-fire model
now for around eight months I can
comfortably say this is the perfect
keyboard for not just gaming but also
work moving over the K 95 RGB platinum
which uses the same switches felt very
familiar the added features and improved
lighting certainly upped the wow factor
the design features and build quality of
the Corsair K 95 RGB platinum are all
first-rate the only issue here for me
personally is the price and it's a big
one
granted premium Cherry MX keyboards
aren't cheap but even so at $200 this
model is very pricy although it would
submit of an apples to Orange Caramel or
gtex flagship g9 10 Rin spark cost just
135 dollars us on Amazon right now
making it a good bit cheaper the steep
asking price becomes even more of an
issue when you take the limited to your
warranty into account and for me this is
particularly puzzling because cheap
cloned keyboards using knockoff MX
switches often come with three to five
year warranties that said though
logitech's
g9 10 does come with the same two-year
warranty anyway the pricing issue aside
this really is as good as it gets from a
mechanical keyboard using Cherry MX
switches for the last eight months or so
I've been using the k70 RGB rapid-fire
and as much as I like that keyboard I'm
keen to set it aside in favor of the new
k95 RGB platinum so what do you guys
think let me know in the comments below
do you think the new flagship Corsair
keyboard justifies the asking price or
are you gonna wait for it to come on
sale at a later date
anyway keen to hear from you guys as
always I'm your host Steve and I'll
catch you on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
