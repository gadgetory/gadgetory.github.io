finally have that epic gaming battle
between the risin 720 700 X and core i7
87 okay now this has been one that many
of you have been requesting I'm sure
there's point neither CP really needs an
introduction both flagship mainstream
desktop parts that come at a similar
asking price but I will discuss the
value aspect of this comparison towards
the end of the video in a moment we will
talk about the test system setup and all
the test conditions but before that a
quick word from today's video sponsor
Corsair for the most mesmerizing RGB
memory on the market check out Corsairs
new Vengeance RGB pro series using
carefully screened ICS Corsair ensures
maximum performance with overclocked
succeeding ddr4 4600 speeds so if you
want to take your gaming systems
performance and looks to the next level
be sure to check out course as vengeance
RGB Pro Series link is in the video
description ok so the core i7 8700 K rig
features the gigabytes and 370 horas
gaming 7 with 16 gigabytes of ddr4 3400
Samsung video memory using the stilts
timings the CPU has been overclocked to
5 gigahertz and cooling at that
frequency is the corsair hydro series h
100 i v2 inside the corsair crystal 570
X then for the horizon 720 700 X rig we
have the Isuzu ROG crosshair 7 hero with
16 gigabytes of ddr4 3400 Samsung video
memory again using the stilts timings
the 2700 X has been overclocked to 4.2
gigahertz and this time we're using the
courser hydra h 150 i pro inside the
corsair crystal 570 X for testing we
have 35 games on the menu at each game
has been tested at 720p 1080p and 1440p
using the GeForce GTX 1080 Ti and once
again going with our new format for this
video since pretty much everyone seemed
to prefer it in the previous video when
I compared the rx 518 GTX 1060 and this
means I'll be discussing
eight of the more interesting tiles and
then jumping to the performance
breakdown for all 35 games tested for
those
you who want to examine all the results
more closely there will be a link to a
post on our patreon account with all the
details having said all that let's get
to the results first up we have the
battlefield 1 results to discuss and
here we see a fairly even fight though
at times it is advantage Intel at the
low 720p resolution the 87 hurricane was
up to 12% faster as the rise in CPU
seemed to cap out at just 116 fps for
the 1% lower result moving to 1080p we
find similar margins for the frame time
performance here Intel was 11% faster
that said it was interesting to see the
2700 X close up on the 8700 ok for the
average frame rate typically it's the
average frame rate where Intel does seem
to pull away then finally at 1440p we're
primarily GPU bound here even with the
GTX 280 I and here the 8700 K and 2700 X
deliver and identical experience moving
on to Far Cry 5 and here we see the 8700
K is up to 15% faster at 720p though
just 8% faster for the frame time result
and it's the exact same story at 1080p
then as we increase the resolution to
1440p the 8700 K is now up to just 6%
faster and then just 2% when comparing
the frame time performance needless to
say at 4k you'd be completely GPU
limited so both CPUs would deliver the
exact same result next up we have a
Rainbow six siege and here the 87 ROK
was 12% faster at 720p for the 1% low
result and 9% faster for the average
frame rate the margin erodes away almost
completely at 1080p here the core i7
processor was just 5% faster then at
1440p we see identical performance with
both CPUs enabling extreme performance
included juda popular demand is full at
night and here we find the 8700 ok
enjoying a 10 to 14 percent performance
advantage at 720p the intel cpu remains
14% faster for the frame time
performance at 1080p but just 4% faster
for the average frame rate then at 1440p
the 2700 X actually edges ahead granted
the frame time performance is identical
but it was 3% faster for the average
framerate here we see a massive
discrepancy in the csgo benchmark
between the frame time and average
framerate performance and this is mostly
down to the fact that this benchmark is
very diverse in what is seen throughout
the benchmark scene depending on the
resolution the 8700 a is between 11 and
24 percent faster than the 2,700 X Wing
comparing the one percent low
performance however when it comes to the
average frame rate the 8700 K is between
33 and 52% fast which are obviously very
significant margins the only saving
grace here for the Rison 7 CPU is the
fact that it a ver Ã¤j-- over 500 FPS at
all times that's probably enough for
even your most pro of pro players I've
heard that the rise in CPUs were having
a rec fest with Intel's coffee-like CPUs
in the new vehicular combat racing
turtle rec fest turns out not so much at
least based on our overclocked results
here the 80 seminary case smashed the
Rison 7 processor at 720p and 1080p
delivering up to 29% more performance
the damage is somewhat mitigated at
1440p thanks to a GPU bottleneck and
with well over 60 FPS at all times it
has to be said the experience while
still great using either CPU player
knowns battlegrounds has never been kind
to AMD however has to be said so not
surprising that we find the core i7
processor enjoying a 17% performance
advantage at 720p that margin though is
slightly reduced to 15% at 1080p and
then it is entirely eliminated at 1440p
once we run into a heavy GPU bottleneck
the last game we're going to look
closely at is vermintide 2 and this
total does play well with AMD hardware
that said it plays even better with the
core i7 87 or EK it has to be said that
the performance was most impressive
using either CPU despite the fact that
the a7 ok pushed up to 26% more frames
at 720p and up to 20% more at 1080p once
we hit 1440p though we're limited by the
gtx 1080i so performance was much the
same okay so based on what we've just
seen in the
at game sample it's pretty clear the low
resolutions the core i7 8700 K is king
but has to be said not by an overly
convincing margin then of course by the
time that we hit the 1440p resolution we
start to run into a bit of a GPU
bottleneck there and both CPUs are able
to maximize what the GTX 1080 Ti is
capable of having said all that let's
break down the data further and compare
all 35 games in one single graph first
up we have these 720p results and the
standout here or the outlier if you will
is see us go where the 8700 K was 52%
faster the 8,700 case shouldn't be that
much faster it's overclocked just 19%
higher and it only has a very very small
IPC advantage we're talking a few
percent at most the Rison v 2600
compared well to the lower clocked core
i5 8400 and csgo
but the faster memory and higher clock
speeds of the 87 are okay
take this to the next level for those of
you that are a bit wild that I've
included this title in my 35 game bundle
you really need not stress about it
removing csgo changes the margin by a
single percent without at the 87 okay is
12% faster at 720p so as you can see
with the GPU limits mostly removed the
8700 K clocked at five hits isn't a
great deal faster than the horizon 720
700 X it's certainly faster but doesn't
blow the AMD processor away
interestingly if we look solely at the
frame time performance we find similar
margins here the 87 okay was 12% faster
on average that said removing Total War
saga does drop the margin down to 10%
and we can see that in 18 of the titles
tested the 8700 K was only faster by up
to a 10% margin in fact we do see a few
titles where the 87 or okay was only
able to match the 2,700 X and 1 being
dirt 4 where it was actually slower now
at 1080p the margin starts to closer and
on averaged 87 hurricane was just 9
percent faster and in well over half the
titles tested the margin was less than
10% the only games to show massive
performance deficits included csgo
rec fest Starcraft 2 and Far Cry primal
so avoid those titles of
you want to show AMD in the best
possible light doing so drops our game
count to 31 and the margin down to just
six percent on average here we see that
we're looking at the frame time
performance that the Rison 720 700 X
looks even more competitive
I see the 8700 was just 9% faster on
average the only really poor result here
for AMD is Total War saga I recently
released tunnel that might have a few
bugs that need going over with the old
iron for those wondering removing that
title drops the margin to just 7%
overall in favor of the 8700 K then
finally at 1440p the 8700 K was just 4%
faster and average and removing older
titles where rising got served such as
csgo and Starcraft 2 that only reduces
the margin by a percent of course we are
mostly GPU limited at this resolution
but what it means is in the here-and-now
there really is very little difference
between these two CPUs for gamers we
also see a 4% margin when comparing
frame time performance though I should
point out the 87 or K was slower and a
handful of tiles while performance was
identical in five of them before
wrapping things up here's a few quick
notes on the power consumption figures
that I observed while testing for the
most part the rise in 720 700 X system
pulled between 380 and 410 Ott's from
the wall again that's when gaming while
the core i7 8700 K system drew between
420 and 444 watts so that means that the
Intel system did consume about seven to
ten percent more power which isn't
really that bad given that it did
deliver around nine percent more
performance on average at 1080p okay so
we've established at the 8700 K is
hands-down faster than the 2700 X when
it comes to gaming no real shocker there
but it has to be said that it's not a
great deal faster realistically at 1080p
with a beastly graphics card you're
looking to gain up to say 15% that would
certainly be more of the high and the
typical high-end but we often saw a
gains of 10% or less so if you're after
a no compromise gaming CPU the 87 ROK is
clearly it and we amongst many others
have said so quite a few times in the
past but what if you want a high-end CPU
capable of strong gaming performance and
want to save as much money as possible
or in that situation is one of these
options better than the other well in
terms of pricing they are very similar
in fact you could say overall the system
and even the platform costs are much the
same the AMD setup might save you $20
making a few percent cheaper and that
cost shrinks to less than a percent for
those building a high-end gaming rig
worth around $2,000 u.s. if you're not
doing any serious overclocking that AMD
will come out on top as the 2700 X comes
with a decent box cooler well the 87
hurricane comes with nothing meaning is
Stan to save around $30 u.s. on a basic
tower style air cooler but still again
it's going to save you very little on a
high-end system so one of the reasons
why someone might be better off buying
the risin 7 at 2700 X system if you're
not just purely gaming and you happen to
run some core heavy applications from
time to time then the 2700 X might be a
better choice as it is better under core
heavy workloads but let's just stick to
the strictly gaming narrative for the
moment and you know throw in a bit of
general usage which is 8700 K is better
at and that also means that we're not
going to pretend that every second gamer
is a streamer because let's be honest
they're not that being the case the
2,700 X or rather the rise and platform
still has one advantage and that is
future support AMD will continue to
release new processes that support
existing motherboards even so I'm not
going to pretend like this really
matters at the high end because I think
it's fair to say ultimately it probably
doesn't it is true that X 470
motherboards will support future cpu
generations while these n 370 boards are
likely at the end of the road with
nowhere to go
ok so let's be realistic about this if
you're buying a core i7 87 or okay or
Rison 720 700 X today when do you
honestly imagine you'll be looking at
upgrading that CPU and potentially the
platform in a year's time I doubt a year
maybe two years at the earliest but it's
probably gonna be more like three I
think most of you would probably wait
threes before upgrading a high-end
system but I could be wrong but anyway
if it's three years that you're going to
be upgrading then you're probably going
to want to get a new motherboard anyway
in that time and given that you
potentially only invested 150
u.s. in 2018 on your motherboard and
that's based on my hypothetical system
costs that we just did are saving that
money on a future upgrade well that
would be nice it's not really going to
make a huge difference either
I remember we are talking about high-end
systems here and not sort of the budget
bangers where every last dollar counts
so I'll admit I'm a bit torn here on
which way to go they're both very
appealing so I guess it is somewhat of a
high-class problem personally though I
don't feel that for gaming and we're
talking about exclusively gaming here
that the extra - cause of the 2700 X is
gonna get it ahead of the 87 or okay in
the next few years so the allure of that
glorious four half gigahertz overclock
would probably suck me in again a really
tough choice here but purely for gaming
I get the core i7 8700 K that being said
they'll let me know which CP you choose
and why as always I look forward to
discussing this with you in the comment
