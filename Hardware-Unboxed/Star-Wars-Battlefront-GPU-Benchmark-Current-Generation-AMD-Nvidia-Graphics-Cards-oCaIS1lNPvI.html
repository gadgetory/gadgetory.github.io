i'm your host Matt and today we're going
to be benchmarking star wars battlefront
see what kind of GPU you'll need to run
the game of popular resolutions star
wars battlefront has been one of the
most anticipated titles of 2015 time
perfectly to proceed Star Wars Episode
seven the force awakens which will open
in cinemas in mid-december and open be
to help to build this height wherever 9
million players took up the invitation
to test out the variety of blasters
heroes land and air vehicles in
multiplayer combat the game's
performance in the beta was impressive
as was the gameplay in the lot of gamers
disappointed when the beta was shut down
and left longing for the game's full
release that day is here and we've runs
battlefront through the gauntlet with 10
of AMD and NVIDIA is current generation
cards the ultra quality preset was used
which turns settings such as textures
lighting shadows and affect quality to
ultra while the anti-aliasing mode is
set to FXAA high for testing will be
using the chase training mission on
Endor the test starts at the initial cut
scene and ends after 60 seconds around
40 seconds of that time is actual
gameplay where we raced through the
forest of Endor and a speeder by the
cutscene only goes for about 18 seconds
and after that we spend 42 seconds
pursuing the rebels on the speeder bikes
the same path has taken each time and
the average of three runs has been
reported
no activity in the vicinity understood
or spear likes riddles are escaping all
available units pursue and engage
vsts are currently deploying in your
area they will engage the rebels oxide
first we tested the game at 1080p and
the results are good news for all
current gen card owners the worst result
was unsurprisingly the gtx 960 which
still managed a very playable 54 frame
average and 50 frame minimum while it
isn't quiet 60fps stock owners who have
overclocked a little will most likely be
able to get there there's a big jump up
from the 380 and 380 x to the gtx 970 93
90 which both had a minimum of 77 frames
an average a very healthy 84 and eighty
three frames respectively not only goes
up from there ambi fanboys we pleased to
see the fury acts on top even if it's
only just at 1440p things became a
little more interesting users of the 380
x or below will want to dial down some
quality settings to play at 1440p the
970 was close to a 60 frame per second
average as was the r9 390 the 980 and 39
TX were able to top the all-important 60
mark although all of these cards did
have minimums below 60 if only just the
fury 980 TI and fury acts were all able
to stay comfortably above 60 frames and
provide a super smooth gaming experience
porque was a big ask for these cards in
battlefront with a 993 90 being required
to get the game above the bare minimum
30 FPS the only card that managed to
average 40 frames of the fury X other
than 980 TI had a slightly higher
minimum as is the usual story of 4k with
new triple-a titles buttery smooth
gameplay is going to require sli or
crossfire with two powerful cards
awesome patience as we wait for AMD and
nvidia next generation of GPUs overall
Star Wars performs really well on the
current generation of cards from both
camps and I think auntie uses in
particular would be pleased with the
results the artwork in the game is great
and the vast landscapes and battlefields
really do the movie justice and
recreating the classic Star Wars feel
the fans of the series love even though
there's not a lot that's new in terms of
the game player when compared to games
like Battlefield and call of duty
there's something
so goddamn cool about doing it all in
Star Wars skins there's no doubt that
I'll be coffee a fair few hours and
battlefront especially now that I'm done
salivating over the benchmark passes
thanks for watching another high one box
benchmark video if you have any
questions at all then please let us know
in the comments or on our forum a harbor
unbox calm as always i'm your host Matt
and i'll send you a virtual hug if you
