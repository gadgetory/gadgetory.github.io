we're checking out the new asrock desk
mini which is a little confusing because
it is called the desk mini as i just
said and that was the same name as the
previous model and then the model before
it so this is the third desk mini so you
sort of have to pay attention to the
numbers or letters that sort of go
before or after it's just referred to as
the desk mini but the first version was
the desk mini 110 and it featured the H
110 chipset supporting sixth and seventh
gen core processors in a tiny 1.9 to a
liter case the desk mini 110 was so
small in fact that it couldn't actually
support a discrete graphics card so that
basically made it an office type PC then
we got the desk mini gt X /r x which
featured a stretched-out micro SD X
motherboard packing either the be 250 or
Z 217 chipset and it also allowed for an
MX M discrete mobile GPU to be installed
this increased their capacity loaded 2.7
liters though admittedly it was still
very compact now we have the new desk me
GTX /rx yep the new 8th gen model has
the same name so it's a bit confusing to
get around this issue retailers are
putting the chipset name in the tile to
make it easier for consumers to work out
which model they're actually buying this
means the latest version is known as the
desk mini z 370 and it comes with either
an MX M form factor gtx 1060 or gtx 980
pre-installed alternatively though you
can buy it without a discrete graphics
card installed but be aware buying these
MXM graphics cards is really next to
impossible as they're not sold at retail
generally speaking you can only buy them
from salvaged laptops and that makes
them extremely rare currently there
doesn't actually appear to be any desk
minis and 370 models on sale but as Rock
says the MSRP for the 1060 model we have
here is 850 dollars us the previous
generation be 250 models are on sale and
the GTX 10-6
version costs a cool $800 us and then
with the GT X 1080 you can expect to pay
something like 1500 us so that makes the
new Zed 370 models slightly more
expensive but overall a $50 increase for
the GTX 1060 model seems very reasonable
still eight hundred and fifty dollars us
for this little PC it's pretty expensive
so what else you get with the desk minis
at 370 included in the package along
with the tiny 2.7 liter case is a 220
watt external power brick which I should
note is very large with a volume of 0.7
liters so that's 26 percent of the desk
minis total size along with the case and
power supply you also get a customs at
370 m STX MXM motherboard that's 2
inches longer than your typical micro
STX motherboard and this extra real
estate has been used to squeeze in an M
X M slots supporting up to type B+ cards
at 113 millimeters long because we have
the GTX 1060 model as naturally came
with a GTX 1060 MXM graphics card
pre-installed in order to get up and
running you'll need to bring your own
coffee like CPU sodium ddr4 memory and
of course storage assuming with a core
i5 8400 they're about $180 us a 16
gigabytes of ddr4 2400 memory you can
expect to pay about 170 dollars us for
that and say a 512 gigabyte Samsung 960
pro there are about $300 then you'd be
looking at pitching in probably about
six hundred and fifty dollars us to
complete this system and that would
bring the total bill for the desk mini
gtx 1060 model to about fourteen hundred
and fifty dollars u.s. that's probably
not that bad or not does sound very
expensive but you can expect to pay
about $400 us alone for a gtx 1066
gigabyte graphics cards so overall might
not be too bad in terms of value but I
will discuss the value aspect of the
desk Mini at GTX 1060 is 370 towards the
end of the review for now we'll take a
look around the unit and then a bit of a
look at the hardware and so
before getting on to some benchmarks
externally it looks sleek the all-black
case features a brushed aluminum front
with clean lines
the circular power button blends in
nicely as does the front IO which
includes two 3.5 millimeter audio jacks
along with the type a and type C USB 3.1
gen
the back you get four USB 3.1 type-a
ports HDMI output which is connected to
the integrated GP within the Intel CPU
and a Gigabit LAN connection also
connected to the GTX 1060 is a display
port a mini DisplayPort and HDMI output
then on the side or I suppose the top
depending on how you orient the case our
another two USB ports though these are
older 2.0 ports still they are handy for
connecting things such as your keyboard
and mouse for example removing the top
panel grants you access to the CPU
socket which sits directly next to the
pre-installed MXM graphics card then the
motherboard tray slides out of the case
and once you remove the front IO cables
you can completely remove the tray and
install your storage devices on the
backside of the motherboard
he'll also find the Zed 370 chipset
which is cooled via a very small silver
heatsink and the CMOS battery as well
however the interesting stuff includes
three and I repeat three MDOT to ultra
ports there are all pcie 3.0 times for
cable and support 20 to 60 or 20 to 80
cards there's also an m2 Wi-Fi port as
well and this can take advantage of the
included Wi-Fi card though be away you
do have to install this yourself along
with the plethora of m2 reports you can
also squeeze in a pair of two and a half
inch SATA 6 gigabits per second drives
in the underside of the disk many pretty
incredible then on the front side of the
mother while we get there real tech a LC
233 codec with the Intel I 219 V Gigabit
Ethernet controller delivering power to
the CPU is a 5 plus 1 phase verum which
is surprisingly capable though asrock
has limited support for processors with
a 65 watt TDP rating the vrm heat sinks
are very tiny though I found in my
testing they do a surprisingly good job
and with the IR gun I never measured
temperatures over 40 degrees evenly
pushing everything into its limits for
testing we've installed a core i7 8,700
processor a pair of team groups ddr4 24
hundred eight gigabyte memory and for
storage to a data xpg gamax s10 nvme
SSDs bit of a mouthful there sadly
though I only have the 128 gigabyte
models for these SSDs and I don't
recommend you purchase those models
they're actually quite poor value we in
terms of cost per gigabyte and the
performance they offer I recommend you
get the 256 gigabyte versions as they
are significantly better value anyway
installing all this hardware was
relatively quick and easy by default
you'll be forced to use the Intel Box
cooler which is a bit of a shame there
is a limited Headroom there so I'm not
sure if there aftermarket options such
as the cryo rig c7 that'll fit I'll have
to get my hands on one of those and
check shortly when I find out I'll let
you guys know in the comment section
below I have one on order although I did
test with the core i7 8700 I also tried
with the core i5 8400 honestly I feel
this is a better pairing for most users
in this unit it runs cooler and
therefore quieter and with the Box
cooler you can also get the most out of
the CPU although it still runs within
the Intel spec the 8700 does enjoy a
decent performance bump with a better
cooler at first I thought it was
actually a power delivery issue but as
it turns out even the core i7 8700 K
does run perfectly fine with an
aftermarket cooler installed I had to
use a large tower style cooler which of
course doesn't fit inside the desk Mini
case so I had to do my testing with the
top panel removed but I just wanted to
see if we were thermal or Power Limited
here and it turns out where thermal
limited by default the desk Mini is
configured with a maximum sustained
boost turbo power draw of just 65 watts
with a one second turbo boost short
power peak of 81 watts as Rock hasn't
done this to save their teeny-tiny verum
but instead limit thermal output to stop
the Intel Box cooler sounding like a jet
engine this limitation means that the
8700 can only produce a Cinebench r15
score of about eleven hundred and forty
points which is
around 20% lower than what you might
expect to see in a desktop system with a
$10 aftermarket cooler if you don't care
about operating volume then you can
increase these limits though it only
boosted the Cinebench r15 score by about
5% while the operating volume increased
significantly as the fan speed picked up
from 2100 rpm to 3200 rpm went under
load after an hour-long stress test the
8700 held a clock frequency of 3.5
gigahertz whereas the 8400 with the same
box cooler could maintain a 3.8
gigahertz operating frequency so again
I'd recommend the 8400 over the 8700 for
use in the asrock desk mini when it came
to gaming of benchmarked half a dozen
titles but before we get to the graphs
here's a quick look at some gameplay
with on-screen statistics stock the desk
minis gtx 1060 hovered around 1550 to
1600 megahertz and peaked at 72 degrees
which has had been on the warm side the
cpu really isn't heavily utilized in
this test so I was able to maintain an
operating frequency of 4.3 gigahertz
though the temps were often very high
getting up around 82 degrees at times
now when I overclocked or well
overclocked probably isn't the right
term to use here since this is a locked
CPU the GPU is overclocked but the CPU
was really tweaked or tuned to remove
some of the limits that the asrock
motherboard imposes so anyway with those
limits removed and then the GPU
overclocked we pushed the core up to
about 1.7 gigahertz at maintained and
the memory was at 8.8 gigabits per
second up from 8-year bits per second we
saw the CPU hit 82 degrees at times but
mostly sat around 70 degrees as did the
GPU as you might have expected the
Destiny was quite loud when overclocked
slash tuned and probably not worth the
extra 5% bump in performance seen in
this stress test anyway moving on to
some game benchmarks and first up we
have battlefield 1 and here the desk
mini had no trouble delivering highly
playable performance at Tony pair using
the ultra quality preset as expected it
was a bit slower than a desktop PC
sporting the founders edition model the
1% low figure was 12 percent lower
though the
average frame rate was just 4% low and
the reason for this I believe is that
lower clocked ddr4 2400 memory while the
desktop system uses a core i7 8700 K
which has clocked at 5 gigahertz with
ddr4 3,200 memory so keeping that in
mind the decimate does actually do very
well and with a little tweaking is able
to roughly match the desktop rig which
was great to see of course custom board
partner models such as the gigabyte or s
gtx 1066 gigabyte is a bit faster again
but overall the desk mini does do well
the dirt fall performance is very
similar again pairing the desk Mini with
faster ddr4 memory really helped boost
the 1% low figure and with a little
extra tinkering we were getting
full-blown desktop gaming PC performance
here we see when testing with Ghost
Recon wildlands that stock the desk Mini
does struggle quite a bit here it was
12% slower than the GTX 1060 foundation
car which was tested in our test system
that said faster memory and a little
tweaking to the settings reduced that
margin to just 5% moving on a Mass
Effect Andromeda here we see that the
desk mini did trail by a small margin
even when overclocked or rather tweaked
with faster memory and a more aggressive
power profile it was a similar story
when testing with prey as well that said
though with over 60 fps at all times
using the highest quality settings at
1080p it was hard to complain with the
results out of the box the desk mini
looked quite weak and titanfall - it has
to be said and I know that memory speed
really helps with this title so that
ddr4 2400 memory would have been
limiting performance here as a result we
saw a rather large 12% uplift for the 1%
low result we're moving from 2,400 to
3,200 memory now a big advantage of the
asrock desk mini is power consumption
that low output power brick really
enables low power consumption at idle
just 30 watts in fact under low
consumption do creep up there a bit and
it wasn't really that far from the power
bricks 220 watt maximum output that said
it did consume 20% less power than our
test system using the GTX 1060 founders
Edition model ok so we've taken a good
look in and around the asrock desk mini
gtx ten 60s and
seventy and we've gotten a taste for how
it performs in games when it comes to
non-gaming tasks it's really going to be
very capable of course depending on what
CPU you end up putting in there but
given how much this bear going costs
anything slower or say cheaper than a
Core i5
8400 really would be a poor choice in my
opinion the core i7 8,700 offers loads
of performance but to get the most out
of it you will need to upgrade the
cooler though I suspect your options
will be very limited for most the
difference between the core i5 8400 and
core i7 8700 and the DES mini are going
to be minimal therefore I recommend
going with the cheaper Core i5 model
asrock says they're targeting LAN party
goers eSports gamers and content
creators with this new des mini series
the tiny 2.7 liter capacity coupled with
the GTX 1060 does make the des mini
ideal for gamers on the move though
these days I'd say that's probably a
very niche market eSports games are
obviously very popular but generally
speaking competitive gamers seek out the
sort of maximum bang for their buck and
that makes the desk mini somewhat of a
tough sell this they really would be the
perfect fit for a content creator
looking for a super compact editing rig
and really whatever the use case the zed
370 desk mini is very capable and really
I love pretty much everything about it
the build quality is excellent the
feature set is great and it's really one
of the most capable small form factor
computers money can buy right now the
only real issue is the price $850 u.s.
it's certainly not for everyone
granted graphics card pricing is
ridiculous at the moment but even so you
can regularly snag a GTX 1066 gigabyte
or about $400 u.s. then a mini ITX said
370 board cost about 140 dollars u.s.
quality Mini ITX cases that can support
full sized graphics cards start at about
$50 us and sfx power supplies also start
at around $50 u.s. so you're paying
around $200 u.s. extra for the desk
minis ultra compact design that's a
hefty price premium but overall the said
370 desk mini gtx 1060 is an impressive
little computer capable of just about
anything
it's really the ultimate compact PC in
my opinion that said it really only
makes sense if you want the smallest
possible PC with a discrete graphics
card though with gtx 1060 enabled
laptops sporting a quad core Core i7 77
rh-q processor starting at around $1000
to me that probably makes more sense you
basically get a 15.6 inch screen and a
UPS thrown in for free because remember
laptops do have batteries so yeah keep
that in mind and I'm going to end this
