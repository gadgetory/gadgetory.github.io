unboxed
I'm your host Matt last week we reviewed
the new Radeon r9 390x and I made what
turned out to be a pretty controversial
comment when I said that the 8 gigabyte
memory buffer was frankly unnecessary
I'd already compared that 8 gigabyte
390x to the 4 gigabyte 290x of 4k and
games that use more than 4 gigabytes of
vram so I knew it to be true before I
share those results to do you I'll show
you a little bit about how be around
works and how we tested much like the
relationship between the DRAM and CPU
vram is a memory buffer that keeps the
GPU fed with the information it needs to
render images vrm holds textures frame
buffer and other assets that are
required in the rendering process such
as bump maps shadow maps and lighting
information this is done because it's
considerably faster for the GPU to pull
information from the vram opposed to say
a hard drive SSD or the system memory
for example the fastest SATA consume SSD
is a limited to around five hundred and
fifty megabytes per second Intel Core i7
59 60 X accesses at system memory at a
little over 50 gigabytes per second and
the Radeon r9 390x moves data from the
video RAM at around three hundred and
eighty four gigabytes per second the big
question that game is often seem to ask
is how much be around they really need
this is where things get a little bit
complicated it's true that high
resolutions high quality textures and
rendering features such as anti-aliasing
can use quite a lot of be round and
today's latest games are pushing
possible gearbox however that doesn't
mean that loading a graphics card with
eight gigabytes of vram will necessarily
ensure a better performance at high
resolutions the key component isn't the
B Rams but rather the GPU connected to
the VM the GPU has to have enough
horsepower to render
image that would required that much be
around the story the iron 390x is a
perfect example it's essentially a
rehashed
I nine 290x and a single to 90s was
never powerful enough for high quality
4k gaming adding an extra four gigabytes
of vram and calling it a day isn't a
real solution and this doesn't improve
the GPUs ability to crush more data as a
result if you were to play a game that
requires 60 bytes of beer and the r9
390x wouldn't necessarily be any faster
than the same GPU equipped with 4
gigabytes of vram the GPU just simply
isn't powerful enough to take advantage
of all the extra data now for my
benchmarks with overclock the gigabyte
r9 290x to match the operating clock
speeds of the H is Island 390x this
means the core has been set at a
thousand 50 megahertz while the memory
has been clocked at 1500 megahertz by
creating a clock for clock scenario the
changes in performance can only be
attributed to the size of the memory
buffer starting with Crysis 3 you can
see that when operating in the same
clock speeds the i9 390x in the i9 290x
delivers the exact same performance at
4k with 22 frames per second each now 22
frames isn't enough for smooth playable
performance in Crysis 3 so the amount of
VRAM being used is irrelevant in this
example regardless we see that the game
only requires a little over 2 gigabytes
of vram which is surprisingly low if we
were to boost anti-aliasing levels to
increase memory usage we'd be reducing
the gameplay looking pretty much like a
slideshow moving on we have battlefield
hardline which was tested using maximum
in-game quality settings two times msaa
applied again the on i-29
X and the 390x deliver the same
performance once clock speeds for the
core memory were matched with just a
thirty-five frames per second average
gamers wouldn't want to go any lower and
this time we see roughly three gigabytes
of VRAM usage out of interest we
increase the MSA a level of the four
times which reduce the average frame
rate to twenty-eight frames per second
and the creates a video game uses to
just three point six gigabytes playing
downlight at 4k only allowed the 290x
and 390x to deliver an average of 29
frames per second so again it's
important to note the clock the clock we
receive the same result Dynalite did
require up to four gigabytes to be
around with this resolution using the
highest quality in game settings it is
impossible to turn anything else up so
four gigabytes was the maximum out of me
around the game could use in our tests
next we have grand theft auto 5 an own
vram hog while the game can be set up to
use 6.5 gigabytes of vram the Radeon r9
390x simply cannot come close to
delivering playable performance on those
conditions the standard graphics
settings were maxed out with FX and
applied while the advanced graphics
settings were disabled this meant that
the I know 390x was good for just 36
frames per second while the I 9 to 9 X
was just one frame slower roughly 3.3
gigabytes of vram was used Metro Redux
is a lot like Crysis 3 in the sense that
visually it is quite an impressive game
and yet it uses very little be read both
the 390x and the 290x average is 24
frames per second and despite that just
1.2 gigabytes of be around was being
used now here we have a game that's well
known for its heavy use of beer and
thanks to a high-resolution DLC package
Middle Earth shadow of Mordor is the
first game we have looked at and seen
VRAM usage exceed for gearbox the i9 390
X or its meteor a message hit 5.2
gigabytes of 4k while the I 1990 X
obviously maxed out at 4 gigabytes
despite the 290 X's obviously around
capacity limitation it was just one
frame per second slower than the 390x
finishing up we have the new Batman
Arkham Knight and
even bigger VM user the middle-earth at
4k the VM usage of the r9 390x in 6.1
gigabytes while the i9 290x was again
limited at 4 gigabytes and yet despite
this once again the I know 290x was just
one frame per second slower so there you
have it even in games that clearly use
more than 4 gigabytes of vram the i9
390x just simply doesn't have the
processing power to take advantage of
its extra memory and subsequently when
they go clock the clock it delivers the
exact same performance as the i9 290x
