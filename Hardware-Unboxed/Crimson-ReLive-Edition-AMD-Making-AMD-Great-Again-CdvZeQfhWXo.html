today we have a very cool video for you
that looks at a new driver update from
AMD and it's more exciting than it
sounds believe me recently when I went
on the search for the best value sub
$200 GPU my exploration landed me on
AMD's Radeon rx 470 as it was clearly
the best choice the new MSRP 170 dollars
u.s. makes this a killer deal and it's
also the same situation down under I
also noted in that review or via
comparison rather that AMD was doing an
exceptional job with their drivers and
since then although it's only been a
month since I made that comparison we've
already seen a couple of updates from
AMD for new games to optimize
performance and stuff so that's been
great to see with drivers playing such a
crucial role it's important for both AMD
and NVIDIA to keep on top of their
updates delivering optimal performance
and the occasional bug fix last year it
seemed in video was on top of their game
here certainly more so than AMD this
year however the rolls seem to reversed
and videos had countless driver related
issues while AMD has been kicking some
serious goals since forming the raid on
technologies group AMD's driver team
really has been on top of things
in fact RTG appears to have been
functioning like a well-oiled machine I
am constantly receiving notifications of
incoming drivers for new games and it's
really great to see as of November AMD
has released 29 separate driver updates
providing improved support and
optimization for over 28 games aimday
also claims that they've seen over 85
million driver downloads this year
so in short they've been busy beavers
celebrating that success AMD is
preparing to release their annual big
software release in 2014 we got catalyst
Omega last year we got the crimson
edition software and this year marks the
arrival of the Crimson Reliv edition
this latest version focuses on further
improving performance stability and
features the initial release includes a
huge amount of bug fixes and stability
improvements here you can see a slide
provided by AMD which outlines some of
the top fixes
feel free to push pause here if you want
to check them all out an interesting new
feature that's been added to the
advanced display settings and
diagnostics provides automatic detection
for bad HDMI cables and signal detection
in my experience HDMI cables seem to
either work or they don't but I'm not an
expert here I probably haven't played
with enough rubbish cables either way
this is a feature that could improve the
end users experience as AMD claims vp9
4k 60 Hertz GPU accelerated reaming is
supported by the Radeon GC and GPUs as
well as the new AMD Stoney Ridge ap use
operating system support extends to
Windows 7 8.1 and of course 10 for some
time now free sync users have been
begging AMD to support borderless full
screen or borderless window modes as
it's often referred to with their free
sync technology to date those wanting to
use AMD's adaptive sync technology have
been forced to run their games in
full-screen mode which kind of sucks for
those that alt-tab a lot well ask and
you shall receive it seems with this new
brand of AMD freesync now supports the
borderless window mode for fast and easy
switching of applications while ingame
this feature is now supported on all GCN
second gen annual GPUs another new
feature is called Radeon chill a power
saving feature that just the framerate
on the fly depending on the players
activity AMD claims that this new
feature can reduce power consumption by
around 30% which is pretty amazing of
course with reduced power consumption
comes lower operating temperatures and
AMD suggests up to a 13% lower operating
temple and amazing enough aim D goes on
to claim that raid on chill can also
lower the average frame time delivery to
display by 32% for a quicker response
time
the only catch tool has been that this
feature is game dependant so your
mileage may vary
AMD has created a whitelist of titles
though and hopefully we'll see that list
grow dramatically over the coming months
for now it looks like the low-level API
such as direct extend Vulcan aren't
supported though showing that they care
about all their customers even those
rockin outdated Hardware albeit just
outdated AMD is extended support for
their walkman utility to the raid on 300
series select 200 series cards and the
fury range so that's kind of
even if we do prefer afterburner AMD
claims that in certain games the new
Crimson relive addition sixteen point
twelve driver boosts frame rate
performance by up to eight percent I
tested two of the games where
performance claims were made those games
were Deus Ex mankind divided and
overwatch
I checked Gears of War 4 as well even
though performance claims weren't made
here the claim was based on performance
changes from the oldest 16.6 point to
driver whereas the previous driver was
the 16 point 11.5 anyway we decided to
test the Crimson relive Edition against
both previous Crimson drivers testing
with overwatch at 1080p we said that AMD
has again been making performance
improvements with this game from the 16
point six point two driver to the
sixteen point eleven point five driver
AMD was able to find four percent more
performance the Reliv driver increased
performance further again albeit only
slightly as we see a two percent bump
here taking the average frame rate to
162 fps that's a six percent jump from
the 16 point six point two driver and
it's great to see these kinds of gains
being made debut sects mankind divided
was consistently faster by 1/2 FPS with
the new Reliv driver and although this
does fall within the margin of error we
ran this test a considerable amount of
times and found the margins were always
much the same in favour of the new
driver finally we have Gears of War 4
and although AMD made no performance
claims here the results are interesting
the minimum frame rate was consistently
higher much higher with the real live
driver jumping from 65 fps to 69 FPS
this allowed the rx 480 to roughly match
the gtx 1060 in this title an impressive
result indeed last but not least aimed
as something else for us capture
customize share oh yeah finally a real
competitor for Nvidia shadowplay radio
and Reliv allows users to record not
just gameplay footage but also the
Windows desktop and windows-based
applications just as shadowplay does you
can also stream gameplay save instant
replays and take screenshots
additionally users can now modify
settings quickly and conveniently with
an easy to access in-game toolbar by
default radio and Reliv is disabled so
to enable that users will have to open
up the Radeon settings by default the
real live recording feature is disabled
so users will have to open up the radion
settings to enable it manually once open
you'll see the real if tab position in
the top middle of the screen from this
tab you can customize hotkeys and
settings for recording streaming and the
overlay this is also where you can able
desktop recording which will allow you
to capture the overlay which is normally
not captured without this feature
enabled the radio and real live overlay
is a hotkey customizable toggle that
allows users direct access to settings
when gaming anyway record is the option
I'm most interested in and I suspect
this will be true for most of you as
well as you might imagine record allows
you to start recording whatever it is
you're currently doing whether that be
gaming or using a desktop application
there are many tweakable settings
available for this feature including
quality resolution recording bitrate
frame rate encoding type and audio
bitrate I should know the maximum
support a bit rate right now is 150
megabits per second where a shadow play
goes as high as 130 megabits per second
and that is the rate I use to show
gameplay footage on the channel I ran
into a few issues when testing re-live
though none of them were terribly
critical for whatever reason most of the
time the hotkeys didn't seem to work in
game forcing me to alt-tab begin
recording at the desktop and then jump
back in the game another issue I found
when testing Gears of War 4 is that when
I was recording the game became v synced
to the framerate I was recording at so
this meant I couldn't exceed 60 fps
however this didn't seem to be an issue
in other games such as battlefield 1
overwatch titanfall 2 and Far Cry primal
for example speaking of Far Cry primal I
use this for a quick performance test
AMD claims that relives impact on
performance is very minimal only taxing
a high-end system by about 3 to 4
percent they have data from 5 games to
support that claim of course I did my
own testing albeit briefly due to time
constraints anyway testing with Fire Cry
primal using the Rx for ad I found that
Reliv reduced the average frame rate by
4.6 percent which is pretty well aligned
with AMD's claims meanwhile the minimum
frame rate was reduced by 4% compared to
the GTX 1060 using shadow play we saw a
3% reduction here so overall pretty
similar performance before wrapping
things up I had intended to do some
benchmarking using the radon chill
feature but in the end decided against
it
honestly I didn't have enough time to
explore the impact of this feature to
the depth that I wanted to I've done
quite a bit of testing but I'm not
confident enough in the numbers to show
them the big issue here being that radio
and chill will have a greater impact
when actually gaming rather than
benchmarking in short it seems campers
have the most a Dane here messing around
overwatch for example I found that
throughout our benchmark run which sees
a constant state of motion and input
from the user radio and chill made
little to no difference however the
second I stopped moving the frame rate
on the RX 480 at 40 and 40 P dropped
down from around 80 fps to just 40 FPS
while extreme movement would boost the
frame rate to levels that you would see
with radio and chill disabled so around
120 fps this wasn't noticeable in game
because the second you start moving
again the framerate smoothly climbs back
up it reminded me very much of the
engine stop start feature in my
Volkswagen this is a feature I'll have
to look at in a separate video and show
you some sort of side by side gameplay
footage with the radon chill feature on
and off well AMD's driver team have been
very very busy impressive stuff here the
performance gains were great to see but
I was particularly impressed in the
minimum frame rates in games such as
Gears of War 4 I'm very keen to test
other titles oh the new features are
also very exciting and I'm very
impressed with relive that capture tool
hopefully this is something AMD will
continue to develop AMD has also
released a cool little benchmark tool
called open capture and analytics tool
or ocat for short which I believe is
based on present mon amie has added a
user-friendly interface while the
application supports DirectX 11 DirectX
12 and the Vulcan API
I haven't used this tool much it as was
much the case with the real live capture
tool I was having issues enabling it in
game using the hotkeys with Vega just
around the corner this massive driver
update is very very well timed this is
something that AMD hasn't always been
good at doing in the past we've sort of
seen massive driver updates come after a
big release so yeah it's great to see at
a performance but it didn't make the
release itself as impactful as it could
have
in so I feel like they haven't fully
capitalized there but this release I
think in the timing wise it's really
going to strengthen Amy's position I
just hope they get the reward they
deserve for all their hard work
having just recommended the RX 470 is
the best sub $200 graphics card last
month anyone who purchased this capable
graphics card it'll feel a bit like all
your Christmases have come at once
because now you can look forward to
slightly better performance and new
features I love what AMD has done here
the next few months should be an
exciting time for AMD fans well hell
really it should be an exciting time for
PC gamers on a whole speaking of
exciting stuff I finally just purchased
my first four gigabyte R X 480 I know
about time I've had numerous eight
gigabyte models on hand for a while now
but for getting a four gigabyte card is
just proven difficult I'm not sure why
it's been that way ever since release
but they have been available at retail
for a while now and I just haven't got
around to buying one and busy with other
things but I pulled the trigger I bought
one now and I could finally do that four
gig testing you guys have been asking
for so the plan is to test all the
current generation Nvidia and AMD GPUs
and I will be using the new driver but
that you've just seen for testing the
AMD GPUs I will be testing with pretty
much all the big 2016 releases for one
huge comparison in total will be 19
games tested and as I said they're all
going to be 2016 releases so any big
tiles from 2015 unfortunately I will be
dropping from this comparison so 19
games 11 GPUs 12 if I end up testing the
Titan XP I'm not sure if I'm going to
throw that in there just yet two
resolutions covering 1080p and 1440p and
of course I'll be making three runs per
test and taking the average minimum and
average framerate result so in total
I'll be conducting well over 1200
benchmark runs so be sure to keep an eye
out for that it should be pretty epic
anyway back to the matter at hand what
do you guys think about the crimson real
live Edition driver let me know in the
comments below if you have any questions
put them down there I'll be sure to read
them and
and yeah that about wraps this one up I
will catch you guys next time
