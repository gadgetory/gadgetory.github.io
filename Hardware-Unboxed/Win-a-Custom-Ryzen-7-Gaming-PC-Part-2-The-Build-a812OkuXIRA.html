and PC giveaway today I'm finally
building the Beast that will end up in
the hands of one lucky subscriber
shortly if you miss part 1 of the series
be sure to check that out because all
the cool hardware that you will see
featuring the bill today was covered in
a little more detail there so I'll
provide the link in the video
description for everyone else you should
know what's on offer here so without
wasting any more time and let's get
building as a lot to get done
wow that is a sweet giveaway pc right
there I don't even want to give it away
now I'm really attached to it this is an
awesome looking pc but i suppose like to
prepare myself to say goodbye speaking
of goodbyes shortly following this video
i will release the last video in this
series which will give you guys all the
details you need to know on how to enter
for the chance to win this awesome
verizon gaming pc again this is a global
giveaway thanks to our good friends over
at thermaltake who have graciously
agreed to foot the bill so to recap all
the hardware that went into this build
retails for roughly 2,200 us or 3300
Ozzy I've also thrown in a copy of
Windows 10 professional which has been
pre-installed with all the necessary
drivers and of course the system itself
has been custom built by yours truly so
that's a pretty special touch a
seriously I think it looks really great
and it's definitely going to look after
whoever ends up winning it some really
cool things about this build on how it
looks is the fact that it's very
customizable so we've got an LED light
strip in the bottom front here and I've
actually stuck the second one rather
than put it up here which probably would
have lit up this tube here quite nicely
probably been a bit strong on the effect
there I put it on the other side of the
radiator so you can see it's sort of
glowing on the top of the motherboard
there and at the moment both those
strips are set to read it but they are
RGB strips and they do multiple effects
so you can make them even more fancy
than what they are now and also we have
the 6 RGB ring plus fans in total
there's three in the front and three in
the top and I've got them set to white
and red LEDs just alternating back and
forth and that looks kind of cool but
again there's endless effects there so
whoever wins the system can customize
that and make them do whatever they want
so you can really change the look of the
system with the LED light strips and
those six fans there's also the w 40 gb
water block in there which I've just set
to a solid white color at the moment but
that can do different effects as well or
just be set to read or whatnot so
they don't want an orange now that they
have well that's coming up yellow purple
blue green and red but I quite like to
look at the white and again you can do
effects and make them scholar cycle or
blink or whatever and so yeah the w-4
block unfortunately that is analog so
you have to do that manually with the
control on the back side but the fans
and the white strips are all custom
they're all digital so they can be
customized via software within windows
so that's very cool thing and quickly
change the way all that looks on the fly
the LED light strips actually plugged
into the MSI titanium motherboard so you
can control that through the command
center software and then the furring
fans will use the ring software by
thermaltake yeah very cool indeed okay
time to stop admiring the system and
wrap this up I know you guys are keen on
details for how to enter the competition
so hang in there that video will be
online in the next day or two for now
I'm going to leave you guys with a few
more shots of the rig I'm your host
