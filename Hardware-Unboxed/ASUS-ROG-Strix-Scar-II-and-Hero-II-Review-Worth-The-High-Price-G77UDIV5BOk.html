we're looking at two new gaming laptops
from a suits that were announced at
Computex last month and these laptops
that a few of you guys have been asking
about it's the Isuzu rog strict SCARA -
and the ROG Strix hero - which don't
really reinvent the wheel as far as
gaming laptops are concerned but there
are some nice improvements compared to
the previous iterations of these systems
both discs are - and hero - a pretty
similar in fact they're so similar that
for the gtx 1060 models both have the
same model name the GL 504 GM the hero 2
is only available with an NVIDIA GeForce
GTX 1016 side while the scar 2 is also
available as a GL v o4 g s which packs a
gtx 10:17 that's essentially the main
difference i have the gtx 1060 hero 2
and the gtx 1070 scar 2 on hand to
review so i have some nice updated
gaming laptop data to get to later aside
from those GPU differences the two
laptops are basically the same the
general construction of the laptops is
the same the other internal hardware is
the same the displays are the same the
i/o is the same and so on the reason why
we have both the hero 2 and scar 2 is i
guess to make things confusing for
customers but also a Sulis the scar is
being suitable for FPS esports games
while the hero is more suited to mobis
considering both are basically the same
from a design and hardware standpoint I
don't really see why seuss needs to list
one for FPS gamers and the other for
mobiles or why the scar is the only one
that has a gtx 1070 option most esports
tiles run really well on the gtx 1060
anyway nevertheless a Seuss's made to
very similar laptops and call them
different things that's the way it is
and to be fair to assist there are some
cosmetic differences between hero and
the scarred hero uses a metal lid that's
half brush and half matte along with a
brushed and lined cyberpunk design
around the keyboard the heat sinks are
painted red for this model and it's the
qwe are keys that are transparent this
guy has a fully brushed metal lid and a
camo pattern around half the keyboard
plus black heat sinks and transparent
WASD keys those are literally the only
differences I could spot so I think
choosing between the two it comes down
to personal preference on what design
you prefer especially for the GTX 1060
models I'm not a huge fan but the camo
designs myself so the hero 2 is more up
my alley but both are a bit heavy on the
gamers style anyway I prefer more
minimalist gaming laptop design whereas
the Strix laptops aren't hiding what
they're designed for in any way while
the hero and sky differ on a visual
style slightly the construction is
identical both laptops use a metal lid
and largely plastic elsewhere and when
combined with a relatively chunky body
26 millimeters thick and 2.4 kilograms
heavy for a 15 inch machine I don't
really get the impression of a high-end
build this is more your mid-range or
entry-level laptop chassis and that's
perfectly fine just note that with these
Strix laptops you're not getting an
all-metal build like with some
higher-end gaming laptops there is one
significant design update to the hero 2
and scar 2 and that's the use of slimmer
bezels around the display while not the
slimmest bezels I've ever seen the
reduction in bezel size helps give the
laptop a smaller footprint and better
highlights the display the first gen
variants of this laptop had massive ugly
bezels so this is definitely a welcome
upgrade unfortunately the shifter
smaller bezels has completely shafted
the webcam into a horrible position
below the display and offset from the
center I actually think the bezels are
just large enough to have the webcam
above the display like in the msi gs70
notional vision camera position instead
the rest of the build is pretty generic
just a typical gaming laptop with
typical features all the i/o is found on
the sides the rear is saved for exhaust
vents while there's also a vent on the
right side but some intakes above the
keyboard and on the bottom on the right
you'll find a USB port and SD card slot
while on the left there are two other
USB ports a USB C port HDMI 2.0 mini
DisplayPort Ethernet and a 3.5 in the
audio jack the USB C port doesn't
support Thunderbolt 3 which is a bit of
a disappointment and bizarrely one of
these three USB ports features USB 3.1
gen2 speeds while the other two USB 3.1
gen
there alone is not that desire to the
fact that the gen 2 port is not marked
any differently to the gen 1 port so
there's really no way to visually know
which port is Gen 2 that's just a
straight-up bad design oversight of
course it wouldn't be in a soos gaming
laptop
ridiculous amount of RGB the keyboard
features for RGB zone standard for a
mid-range laptop as per key RGB is
typically left to more expensive
machines but there's also an RGB a sooth
logo on the lid and an RGB strip along
the front edge too much RGB for me but
it's there if you want it the keyboard
itself again it's pretty average neither
particularly good nor bad the travel
distance is great but the response to
each key is a bit spongy for my liking
it just lacks that solid click I enjoy
from a good keyboard that said the
layout is fantastic you get a full
numpad without compromising the arrow
keys and there's dedicated volume
control buttons and it's complemented by
a fantastic responsive trackpad with
separate left and right click buttons
often companies choose the worst track
pads they can find for gaming laptops
but this is one area as soos has over
the competition
both this car too and hero to use one of
the new 15.6 inch 1080p 144 her 2 IPS
LCD laptop panels and aside from a few
slight differences in color reproduction
they are effectively identical neither
laptop features g-sync but the panels
high refresh rate is a welcome addition
though a lot of other gaming laptops are
using similar display so it's not a
super unique feature that said the older
hero and scale models do not have this
display so it's one area that has
received an upgrade
I'm not going to go into detail on the
color performance of this display other
than to say brightness is good at around
300 nits and I achieve just over a 1,000
to 1 contrast ratio color temperature
and color accuracy are quite good as
well with Delta is below 3.0 which was a
bit of a surprise considering some other
gaming laptops I've reviewed in the past
for gaming it's a great display and
outside of gaming it still holds up
pretty well let's talk performance both
laptops come standard with the core i7 a
750 H and that's what was used in the
morals I reviewed although some low-end
configurations will use the i5 8300
instead there was also 16 gigabytes of
dual channel ddr3 666 in the hero 2 to
go along with the gtx 1066 gigabyte
while the scar 2 with the gtx 1070 bump
that up to 32 gig in my configuration
although i believe 16 gig will be the
standard option in terms of cpu
performance the i 78758 he performs
roughly on par with the previous 80 758
laptops we've tested so there's not a
lot of point rehab
a lot of what was talked about in my
original 87 58 review if you want more
detailed information on this CPU and how
it performs in a variety of tests go
check out my dedicated review of that
processor but I will say here is the
8750 H in the hero 2 is on average ever
so slightly faster than our gigabyte
error 50 next test platform to the tune
of 3% across a range of tests that's
pretty close to the margin of error and
it's also worth noting the hero to
perform slightly better than the scar 2
also to the tune of 3% across the range
of tests that are not GPU bound for
those upgrading from an older laptop say
with the quad core Core i7 7700 HQ the 6
core cry 78758 and either the Hero 2 or
scar 2 will provide around 40 to 55
percent more performance in CPU limited
multi-threaded workloads that's a
significant jump in processing power so
if you're using an older laptop it's
definitely worth considering an upgrade
to one with the 87 50 H as for gaming
the GTX 1060 and 1070 aren't exactly new
GPU so there's not a whole lot to say
that hasn't already been said however
this is the first time I've had a chance
to benchmark either of these GPUs the
fully fledged variants not the limited
max-q models when paired up to the kora
78758 so I'll be showing how this laptop
performs in a handful of games and then
show a performance round up at the end
the first game I'm showing here is
hitman which is the most CPU intensive
game in our test suite and really
benefits from the increase in power
provided by the cross of an AC 750 H
here the hero 2 with the gtx 1060 is 20%
faster in average frame rates and 6 %
faster and 1% lowers compared to a
laptop with the same GPU but just the
quad core Core i7 7700 HQ interestingly
the gtx 1070 sky 2 is actually slower
when comparing 1% lows but more than 30%
faster on average and that's something
we'll discuss a little bit later next up
we have assassin's creed origins another
game that benefits significantly from
the 8750 h at least when it comes to 1%
lower frame rates the hero 2 keeps a
much more consistent frame rate posting
nearly double the 1% low frame rate
compared to a laptop with the 7700 HQ
though average frame rates are just 3%
higher the GTX 1017 laptop approves upon
the gtx 1060 reserve
by a slim margin in Star Wars
Battlefront - there is not much
difference between gtx 1060 laptops with
the 7700 HQ or 87 58 inside the hero -
here is just 4% faster in 1% lows the
gtx 1070 scar - improves the average
frame rate by a decent 25 percent
although 1% low is only marginally
improved compared to the gtx 1060 Middle
Earth shadow of what is another game
it's mostly GPU bound so there's no real
difference here between the hero 2 and
older 7700 HQ laptops that said it's one
of the better performers for the scar -
boasting 38 to 40 percent more
performance than the 1062 laptop when
looking at the ultra preset lastly we
have Wolfenstein 2 and here the 87 50 H
provides a decent performance uplift of
9% on average and 7% in 1% lows the gtx
1070 laptop pulls ahead by a huge 48
percent margin on average but only
marginally is ahead in 1% lows looking
across all the games I tested when
comparing the hero 2 with the gtx 1060
and 8750 h2 the ASA predator Triton 700
which uses the gtx 1060 and 7700 HQ the
hero 2 is 3 percent faster in average
frame rates and 6 percent faster in 1%
lows many games are entirely GPU limited
and show no difference when playing at
Ultra settings while others are more
affected and show closer to a 10 or even
20 percent uplift as you move down to
more medium is quality settings the 8750
h comes more into play and it's there
you'll more often see gains in that 10
to 20 percent region the GTX 1070 sky 2
is more interesting when looking at
average frame rates the laptop performs
as expected it's 33% faster than the GTX
1060 Hero 2 across a 14-game average in
GPU bound scenarios however when looking
at 1% low performance which is an
indicator of how smooth the game is the
scar 2 is only 11 percent faster on
average but it's more interesting than
that as the breakdown shows some games
get next to no benefit in this metric
from the faster GPU while others benefit
by as much as 40% which is more in line
with the performance uplift in average
frame rates and this is why benchmarking
with 1% low frame rates is so important
because it highlights something that the
average frame rates do not and that's
namely how can
the gameplay experience is and with the
sky - there were times where frame rates
are noticeably dropped or even studded
briefly in some titles and it was an
issue I couldn't really nail down or
resolve that said not all games were
affected as the charts show and I was
running a fully updated system with the
latest drivers installed in any case the
typical experience from the gtx 1070 in
the sky - is gtx 1060 level performance
at worst and in the best cases upwards
of 30% more performance of course one of
the key things about a laptops
performance is how loud and hot the
cooler gets as soos is using a dual fan
design he with the single heatsink
provided for the CPU and two heat sinks
for the GPU though there is a shared a
heat pipe between the two thermal
performance was really strong achieving
some of the lowest temperatures we've
synced to this hardware and with the gtx
1070 only heating up by a few degrees
more than the gtx 1060 surface
temperatures were well in check - with
most of the keyboard area sitting below
30 degrees and there were just a few 40
degree hotspots in non-critical areas
the strong cooling performance does come
at the expense of noise though the sky
and hero are quite loud under load
most of our max Q test laptops are
noticeably quieter that said the noise
profile is decent without any
high-pitched whining so it's reasonably
easy to drown out with game audio a
quick note on storage here the hero 2
review unit came with the Toshiba 256
gigabyte PCIe nvme SSD and a Seagate
Barracuda pro one terabyte hard drive
while the sky packed a Samsung PM 9 81
512 gig nvme SSD with a Seagate fire
CUDA one terabyte sshd the PM 9 81 is a
faster SSD so it had the edge across our
storage performance tests while the sshd
is also a better option for game loading
from spinning disk storage internally
there is just one MDOT 2 slot and a 2.5
inch drive base so your upgrade options
are limited to replacing what these
laptops come with out of the box both
doom slots are also populated however
it's extremely easy to remove the base
of this laptop and have access to these
slots so you should have no trouble
upgrading either the RAM or storage if
you want while the design of the Hero 2
and Skaar 2 is nothing to get excited
about there are plenty of things to like
about these new mid-range options from a
soos performance particularly for the
GTX 1060 Hero 2 is great and with the
chorus of an a7
eh inside both laptops are much faster
in productivity workloads the CPU
doesn't have the massive impact in games
but in the most CPU limited scenarios
you will see a performance improvement
you're also getting a new 1080p 144
Hertz display with slimmer bezels and it
Cooley is not going to limit performance
of either the CPU or GPU though that
does come at the expense of noise
unfortunately everything good about
these laptops comes crashing down when
looking at the price the hero 2 as
reviewed costs a whopping 1,700 u.s.
dollars while this gtx 1070 scar to will
set you back two thousand dollars in
australia prices start at $2,700 e
dollars for laptops with a mid-range
build and for the hero 2 in particular
mid-range Hardware these prices if I'm
honest a pretty outrageous there asa
predator Helios 300 with a very similar
hardware configuration to the Hero 2
will set you back just 1,200 u.s. to be
fair there's no 1 terabyte hard drive
inside but that'll cost you less than
$50 to add in yourself sure the Helios
300 doesn't give you an RGB keyboard or
slim bezels
but there is no way those features are
worth $500 and there's no shortage of
other equivalent options for much lower
prices including the HP omen 15 inch and
the MSI GP 63 I mean for just $100 more
than the Hero 2 you could get the msi
ge62 5 stealth in one of my favorite
gaming laptops of this generation with
the far superior thin and light design
and near equivalent internal hardware
the pricing for the hero - basically
destroys its competitiveness amongst
these other options your options are a
bit more limited if you want the gtx
1070 and the OS 78758 combo provided by
the sky - but once again I'd point you
towards the msi GP 63 for several
hundred dollars less sure you're only
getting a 120 Hertz display instead of
144 Hertz but it offers far better bang
for your buck in is similar chassis and
I haven't even talked about i7 7700 HQ
laptops there are often a few hundred
dollars less than the a 758 laptops but
provide a very similar gaming experience
for the most part and the pricing
situation is a real shame the ROG Strix
car - and hero 2 a well made laptops
that delivered the exact performance and
features
most gamers want and if pricing was
competitive with other systems I'd be
able to recommend them but when you can
get similar hardware for literally 30%
less money I'm sorry your soos but
you've taken yourself out of the race
