your host Matt and today we're taking a
look at the sapphire r9 fury when AMD
launched its new flagship on our fury X
card it wasn't as groundbreaking as we'd
all hoped well it was a good carden's
high bandwidth memory was impressive at
six hundred fifty dollars wasn't able to
beat the nvidia 980 TI that it needed to
in order to assert some red team
dominance there are three other cards
and the fury family being released and
today we're taking a look at the iron
fury the log form is sibling to the fury
axe if you represents a few important
distinctions to that of the fury axe
firstly it comes in at a hundred dollars
cheaper so will be interested to see how
it stacks up value wise the fury axe is
also only available in the reference
closed loop cool design whereas the fury
will be available in fully custom cards
made by AMD's board partners on the
technical side the feejee GPU in the
fury has 50 60 years enabled compared to
64 in the fury x however the number of
geometry units and arrow PS remains the
same also in line with fury axe is the
memory subsystem where the fury features
4 gigabytes of high bandwidth memory and
the memory clock remains unchanged to at
500 megahertz the eyeline furious clock
speed has been slightly adjusted down to
a thousand megahertz which is just a
five percent reduction from the fury X
so far we've only seen cards being
launched by sapphire and a Zeus and we
have on hand today's sapphires design
time you go and see how it performs
first up let's take a look at the far
cry 4 results the are no fury managed 37
frames per second which is notably only
to less than the height max it also
managed to edge out the 980 TI by a
couple of frames GTA 5 told a different
story where the eye no fury managed 42
frames per second this time was a couple
of frames behind the 980 TI which was
still good in battlefield hardline the
red team suffered a little and both the
fury and the fury axe fell behind the
1980s
see I the are no fury is still performed
well though only a couple of frames
behind the fury acts in thief the
unknown fury was right back up there
with the tight necks Pauly only a single
frame per second behind again and
managed to eke out a victory over the
980 TI by three frames per second Green
Team was back on top and watchdogs where
the I know furious got 38 pounds per
second this was two frames behind the
fury acts and five friends behind the
980 TI the witcher 3 told a similar tale
where we saw the eye no fury managed
just 26 frames per second this was three
frames less than the fury axe and four
frames less than 980 TI the I know
furious power consumption figures were
as expected using a little bit less than
virtually all of its competitors only
the GTX 980 consume less power but as
evidence in our benchmarks the I know
fury is a faster GPU as expected the are
no fury ran a lot hotter than the liquid
cooled 09 3x it was also a lot cooler
than the reference design GTX 980 TI
though as it stands is roughly a hundred
dollars separating the radeon r9 fury
from the more expensive fury ax making
the form of fifteen percent cheaper
that's not a big difference but then the
fury was never going to be more than
thirty percent slower than the fury acts
so the price seems fair however in
reality the fuel's an average just seven
percent slower in our tests making it a
much better by the only real
disadvantage here is that the fury is
quite a long graphics card and the
sapphire model takes up three slots so
don't expect to fit it in any small
form-factor gaming systems it also runs
considerably hotter than the liquid
cooled fury axe but as 71 degrees under
full load temperatures never got out of
hand something we didn't go into great
detail about was overclocking this is
because overclocking wasn't hugely
successful and we're only able to
squeeze out another 100 megahertz from
the core which was a temp stone
overclock netting just a few extra
frames in most games the biggest issue
the radiant are no fury is its
availability or rather lack of so far
just a sous and sapphire have developed
fewer graphics cards and even then
getting your hands on one
can be difficult likewise availability
of the fury ax is also very poor with
major retailers such as newegg.com
completely our stock just two months
after the release let us know if you've
got in your hands on one this is being
mad for hardware I'm box hit like hit
