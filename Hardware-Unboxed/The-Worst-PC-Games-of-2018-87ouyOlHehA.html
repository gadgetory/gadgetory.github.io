of days ago you might have seen my video
discussing the best PC games of 2018 and
there was some absolute rippers in there
including Forks at Horizon for which our
community crown as the overall best PC
game of the year but while there were
lots of enjoyable games released on PC
this year there were also a ton of very
disappointing games and we're going to
go over some of them across five
categories in today's video once again
we asked the wonderful members of our
discord community to chuck up some
recommendations and there was an
overwhelming number of nominations for
one game in particular so let's get into
it
we're starting off here with the big one
the worst PC game released in 2019 now
we could go and find some terrible
obscure game released onto steam that no
one played and declared that the worst
game released in 2018 but that doesn't
seem right sure there are lots of awful
games released every year that no one
pays much attention to but to truly earn
the crown of the worst PC game of the
year it has to be something a lot of
people played the overwhelming majority
of our community nominated fallout 76 as
the worst game of the year and I can't
think of a better title to win this
coveted award fallout 76 was not just a
very disappointing game at launch
it was also outright bad a game that
really no one asked for or wanted since
the game was announced the community has
expressed nothing but disappointment
that the next fallout title was a weird
broken multiplayer cache crap there was
perhaps a little bit of hope around
launch that it might be a good or
interesting game but that was quickly
dashed when people actually went and
played it for that 76 is bad in a number
of ways as a big fan of the Fallout
series personally the biggest problem to
me is the lack of NPCs which leads the
game world empty and devoid of character
or life there are enemies around the
place you occasionally run to other
players or you can play as a group but
some of the best parts of previous
Fallout titles were the intricate
interesting and well-written quest lines
none of that is present in 476 this
means that when you're exploring the
game world you're unlikely to run into
any sort of meaningful quests which just
makes the game boring on top of that for
that 76 looks bad it runs like crap and
it's filled with technical issues
ranging from broken quests to bugs to
network issues and crashes Bethesda's
creation engine is one of the worst
still in use by a major game studio in
2018 and I reckon a lot of the problems
with the game came down to its
developers needing to spend a huge
amount of time just integrate
multiplayer into the engine by all
reports this was a massive technical
challenge and I wonder how the game
would have ended up if the developers
spent less time on that and more on
actually improving the in-game content I
could go on about the problems with for
at 76 but the end of the day it was
criticized by reviewers it was
criticized even more by gamers and it
has quickly received price cuts to 2 or
this negative feedback plus there was
that duffel bag controversy so throw
that in there too and for that 76
becomes the deserved winner of worst PC
game of the year
to be honest parts of Music's could
probably take out a number of the
categories in this video but when it
comes to optimization I think it's just
edged out by another highly
disappointing game released this year
Just Cause for Just Cause 4 sits in a
special group of PC games released this
year that doesn't run particularly well
on PC you can throw for at 76 and
Assassin's Creed Odyssey in there as
well we've ruled that Assassin's Creed
Odyssey though for this award because
well perform it sucks some areas of the
game do look spectacular and we ruled
out for that 76 because it looks like
garbage and runs terribly but does run
noticeably better than just cause for
with jessyca's port you hit with the
double whammy of a game that doesn't
look amazing but also requires an NVIDIA
GeForce r-tx 2080 TI to consistently
play above 60 FPS at 1440p while no card
we benchmark averaged 60 FPS at 4k to
make matters worse some areas of just
scores for s graphics have been
noticeably downgraded since Just Cause 3
was released back in 2015 particularly
the water effects most other aspects to
the graphics look the same as well so
it's not like just cause for has
compromised in some areas to improve
others yet Just Cause 3 was playable on
a gtx 980ti
at 1440p with frame rates over 60fps and
it's not like Just Cause 3 was
particularly well optimised at the time
fast forward to just calls for and that
st. GPU is good for just 45 FPS on
average at 1440p
for very similar visuals I don't think
there's any way to describe that sort of
result other than a massive fail on the
part of Avalanche Studios short it does
in the game runs better on consoles with
Avalanche doing some work to get there
apex game engine running better on a
very weak CPU but even then the
resolution of the game on consoles is
not great and it's clearly come in the
expense of PC gamers who Avalanche
basically forgot to optimize the game
for the state of just goes for on PC in
2018 is simply not good enough and
that's why it's taken out our award for
worst optimised game of the year
there's only one real standout candidate
for the worst graphics category and that
game is again fallout 76 this is a major
triple-a title released in 2018 from one
of the world's biggest game studios and
publishers yet it looks absolutely
terrible as we've mentioned earlier to
have his terrible performance to match
for that 76 reuses a lot of assets
designed for fallout 4 again that came
out in 2015 and at the time didn't look
all that flash fast forward three years
and with very few changes made to the
presentation of the game for that 76
looks even worse relative to other games
released around the same time some
aspects of the lighting system are the
only graphical effects that look half
decent in the game occasionally you can
spot some nice vibrant foliage and
volumetric lighting and other times
you're left with unimpressive geometry
rough textures a poor material surface
simulation system terrible shadows
lackluster water bad anti-aliasing and
Bethesda's typical janky animations this
looks like a 5 to 7 year old game
visually yet it was released this year
on top of that the game is rife with
technical issues ranging from launching
with the 64 FPS cap which has since been
removed but the game still stutters
bizarrely above 64 FPS it does not
properly support ultra wide monitors
some areas of the game like the map
inexplicably perform like garbage
they've also been widespread reports of
crashes and other issues so fall at 76
is a clear winner in two categories this
year hopefully with Bethesda's upcoming
games they completely rebuilds their
game engine from scratch because the
creation engine they're using right now
is fundamentally broken and flawed at
this point
worst stability is a little different to
the other technical categories we've
just been discussing we've talked about
the worst optimization or how a game
runs relative to its output and about
the worst graphics but I've included an
extra category here for the game with
the worst stability began that crashed
the most when we played or simply
refused to run for bizarre reasons and
that game was Kingdom Come deliverance
now this game isn't bad per se in fact I
played the entirety of it and quite
enjoyed it there's a lot to like about
the medieval setting the quest design
and the punishing combat system but the
game was not shipped in a good state in
fact despite the game receiving several
patches while I was playing through over
the course of a month or two it never
seemed to become stable enough for
extended periods of game clay instead
Kingdom Come deliverance would crash
roughly every hour sometimes more often
that on my system and it wasn't just me
that experienced these issues various
forums are filled with reports of just
how unstable the game was on PC to make
matters worse the game included a highly
restrictive save system so when the game
did crash you were almost certain to
lose a lot of progress this basically
force game is to install mods to fix the
save system simply so they could save
often enough that crashes would have
less impact on progress now I'm not 100%
sure how the game is holding up these
days I've heard there have been even
more patches since I last played that
have improved the situation but that's
not stopping Kingdom Come deliverance
from featuring in our worst PC games of
2018 list the simple fact is if a game
is buggy broken or unstable when you
launch it to the public and begin
charging real hard-earned cash that's
completely unacceptable game is simply
shouldn't have to put up with broken or
unfinished products at launch developers
should delay the game and get it right
before they start selling
this last category might sound a bit
familiar to our worst game category but
hear me out here
when 476 was announced a lot of people
immediately thought it wouldn't be any
good multiplayer fallout built in the
creation engine with the same graphics
and systems as fallout 4 yeah that
pretty much is going to suck as what a
lot of people are thinking but I feel
another category is appropriate to
capture the most dissapointing game of
the year the game that looked cool when
it was announced the game that was
highly anticipated by a lot of people
and one that ultimately did not deliver
when it was released there were a lot of
games that I felt fit this category in
2018 but after discussions with that
community the ultimate winner is seeing
thieves developed by rare sea of thieves
was supposed to be the big Microsoft
exclusive game for the first half of
2018 in the announcement footage and
subsequent demos it looked very
promising you know a cool multiplayer
game where you sail around the high seas
act like a pirate pillage stuff shoot
others with your flintlock pistol and
more than water simulations particular
were absolutely stunning but on least
the games simply lacked content all this
talk of a true pirate simulator you can
jump into and have fun with friends turn
out to be a bit of a bust with almost
zero variety to missions or enemies
there were always a few questions before
launch about you know what you would end
up doing in sea of thieves and the
developers were a bit cagey about the
goals and objectives as if it was you
know some big secret for players to
uncover but in the end it seems the
developers weren't really hiding
anything and despite the game being in
the works for four years Co Thieves
wasn't much fun after the first few
hours other games are considered for
this category include the remarkably
show at Far Cry 5 battlefield 5 that
launched effectively unfinished and just
calls for but those disappointing of
that bunch is definitely sea of Thieves
hence it's the deserved winner here and
that pretty much wraps up this video
overall I think 2018 was a bit of a
mixed bag for PC gaming a few great
tiles but also a few disappointing ones
a lot of these best games turn out to be
console exclusives like God of War
spider-man and Red Dead Redemption
- which as PC gamers can't play unless
we also own a console hopefully there's
a few more multi-platform winners in
2019 as always you can subscribe for
