today we're looking at big Phoenix's
Aegis core micro ATX case first thing
that you notice about this case is
pretty damn cool looking and we will
lucky enough to get in Hardware on box
blue but it does also come in red black
yellow and white
the shield inspired front panel looks
pretty awesome but it can be a bit of a
fingerprint magnet it does come in black
no matter which color you choose from
and the whole thing is constructed of
plastic but it does feel pretty
high-quality there's also something
pretty cool behind here that will show
you a bit later once we've got a plugged
in this is a pretty hefty front panel
and there is room inside to mount front
intake fans so you can save a little bit
of room inside the case you're plenty of
ventilation here on the sides and it is
covered in the black mesh to prevent the
build-up of dust behind the front panel
here there is a magnetic dust filter as
well that can cover either 240
millimeter fans or three 120 millimeter
fans left side of the case you've got a
nice big window seat row for your
awesome hardware then on the right side
so just solid blue top top we've got
this large plastic grille nice and easy
to click in and out take something rest
of the space you've also got the i/o
panel on the front button wise you get a
large power button in the middle she
does have the big phoenix logo your pre
sit on the right and there's actually a
3-speed fan controller on the left which
can handle up to four fans at the time
you've also got the standard 2 USB 3
ports and then you're already go to
Jack's in the middle on the back fairly
typical layout with your power supply at
the bottom your five PCI expandable
slots in the middle iron panel
exhaust and on the right from the bottom
of the case you got a four a nice big
rubber feet and you also got a huge
magnetic dust filter on the bottom -
that should keep the dust out of your
power supply having the rest of the case
now let's have a look inside there you
can see when it's empty the case
actually looks pretty damn cooled as you
can see the pretty striking blue paint
job on the right side panel door but
unfortunately emergency this is gonna be
covered with hardware once we've
installed it we've got eight pre
installed motherboard standoffs
to speed up your installation and as you
can see there's also a large cutout here
which makes a lot easier to install your
aftermarket CPU coolers you can also see
that big Phoenix has included a few
pre-cut rubberized holes for cable
routing drive locations are typical but
there is still plenty of room with the
terabytes of storage we've got two cages
for three and a half inch drives one at
the bottom here behind the power supply
and there's also one up here at the
front of the case few two and a half
inch drives has room for two up here at
the front one mount against the wall the
back and there's actually a room for a
hidden one right behind the power supply
together cooling wires the casing that
comes with one exhaust fan in the back
here but there is room for up to eight
120 mm fans or five 140 mm fans we
thought we set up a custom blue theme
system inside the case you can see how
it all fits in and looks we've set up
five 15 inspector blue 140 millimeter
fans to cooling the big Phoenix fury
750gb power supply big phoenix alchemy
blue sleeve cables and big phoenix
alchemy of white LED strips we're using
azarov's at 97 and pro for mini ATX
motherboard and impaired Kingston's 8
gigabyte HyperX fury blue kids we're
using a core i5 4690k CPU with fantex
PHT CD 148
cool in blue of course gigabits radian
r9 390x is the graphics card of choice
and for storage we've installed one OCZ
vector 180 SSD and a pair of western
digital black for terabyte hard drives
you can also see our full parts list in
the video description now powered on so
we can see how it looks as you can see
this is a pretty damn awesome looking
and powerful system during our
benchmarks that never really went above
sixty degrees Celsius which also proves
the cases cooling prowess now we've got
a plugged in I can show you the cool
little feature mentioned earlier there's
actually a two point eight inch
customizable display behind the front
panel and as you can see now we're
showing off the grand theft auto five
looker overall the aegis is an extremely
cool unique and functional gamer case
despite being just a forty three liter
mini ATX case we proved that it can
handle big hardware especially on the
cooling and storage front so if you're a
gamer looking for a mini ATX case that
you can make unique to you today you
just definitely worked is the point this
has been Matt for Hardware unboxed let
us know what you think about the a just
