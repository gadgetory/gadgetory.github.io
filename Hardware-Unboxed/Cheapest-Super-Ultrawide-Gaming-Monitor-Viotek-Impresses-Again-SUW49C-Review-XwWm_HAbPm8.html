first monitor review of 2019 hopefully
with many more to come what we're
looking at today is a new beastly
monitor from vo-tech the su w 49 C which
I assume stands for super ultra wide 49
C this monitor features a 49 inch 38 40
by 1080 panel so it has a 32 9 aspect
ratio hence the term super ultra wide
because it's a hot wider than
traditional 21:9 monitors biotech is
pitching this as a gaming monitor so it
packs a 144 Hertz maximum refresh rate
with free sync there's also HDR support
and it's using a curved VA panel which
shouldn't come as a surprise I actually
think a 32 9 monitor would really suck
if it wasn't curved so no complaints
from me about the 1800 hour curvature
used here this thing is so wide that the
slight curve just helps to bring in the
peripheries better interview now you
might be wondering why would you even
want such a wide monitor and the answer
is simple it's the equivalent of 227
inch 1080p monitors side-by-side but
without the bezel between them that sort
of configuration is quite common to see
so this monitor is essentially combining
what used to be a dual screen setup into
the one very wide panel when you think
of it as replacing two displays rather
than just as a massive ridiculously wide
single panel does make a lot more sense
for gamers you also get the advantage of
extra width for better immersion a while
back a lot of people getting into multi
monitor gaming setups using things like
aim DS Eyefinity technology but it never
really took off because it didn't work
that well 21:9 monitors came in and
basically replaced multi-monitor setups
and now these 32:9 displays are
providing even more immersion closer to
what multi-monitor setups used to
provide but without the hassle of course
not every game supports village' no
displays but in those that do having the
extra width adds a lot to the experience
so that's the use case for a 49 inch
super ultra wide panel like this I think
what via tech is providing here does
tick both those boxes on the gaming side
you have a high refresh rate with free
sync and on the productivity side there
are features like picture-in-picture so
you can have two sources hooked up just
playing them side-by-side like it should
dual screen setup but without a bezel in
between there's also an included remote
I'm not sure how many people will be
using this sort of display more as a TV
than as a monitor though of course via
tech it's also known for making highly
affordable monitors this one comes in at
800 US dollars which again makes it the
cheapest in its category sure 800 bucks
is still a fair bit of money but its
main competitors are the Samsung C 49 J
890 and C 49 HG 90 both of which are
around a thousand US dollars we'll take
a look at how this monitor performs in a
moment but we've been impressed with via
text value propositions in the past in
terms of aesthetics this monitor is a
simple affair there's no crazy game
elements it's just a nice basic design
with reasonably slim bezels the reuses a
basic matte plastic while The Stand uses
a combination of black metal black
plastic and a shiny silver bar for such
a wide display the stand is pretty damn
sturdy much more so than summer vitex
smaller displays which is a bit of a
surprise they're the real bits of flair
vo-tech added to the design are the red
ring around the stance connection to the
rear and an illuminated RGB LED at the
top of the stand pillar the controls for
the LED are basic you can choose to
either turn on or off the red green or
blue elements with no granular control
or you can simply disable it entirely as
readjust ability you don't get a whole
lot here there's no tilt or swivel
support understandably for a monitor of
this size however there's also no height
adjust feature like ordered via Tech's
other displays I feel that the s UW 49c
sits too low and together sitting higher
you'll need to replace the stand with a
third-party vasive mount height
adjustment on a monitor of this size I'm
sure is a complex task but what we're
left with here is only tilt adjustment
support for inputs we get a single
DisplayPort 1.2 port plus three HDMI
ports one of which is HDMI 2.0 compliant
there's also an audio jack and the
monitor has built-in speakers which as
you might expect aren't particularly
amazing disappointingly vitek continues
to use basic 4 button controls for the
on-screen display although you can
control the settings using the included
remote so it's not as big of an issue as
with their past monitors aside from the
picture-in-picture modes I already
described you get a fairly typical range
of settings and controls in the OSD here
you
mine with via Tex other high-end
displays this is great to see because
via text Reaper Manos use a really basic
on-screen display with basically zero
functionality but with this display
you're getting a lot more features let's
talk about performance now and the su w
49 sees a little strange in some areas
for example the monitor does have an
overdrive mode which biotech claim will
deliver a formula ii response time
however you cannot use overdrive in
conjunction with the maximum 144 hertz
refresh rate for some bizarre reason the
setting is disabled and greyed out at
144 hertz but is accessible at 120 hertz
or lower this isn't something I've seen
before it's pretty strange to have no
overdrive functionality at the maximum
refresh rate but usable overdrive at
lower refreshes for our testing we
always test response times at the
panel's maximum refresh rate because if
you're buying a 144 Hertz monitor you'll
want to be using it at 144 Hertz
so without overdrive the ASUW 49c is a
bit of a poor performer with an average
greater gray response time of ten point
five four milliseconds putting it among
the slowest monitors we've tested in
this metric some transitions were up
above fifteen milliseconds which is
standard for a VA panel without
overdrive
this makes the su w 49c a poor 144 Hertz
monitor because response times are
limiting performance to more like a
hundred Hertz in the 144 Hertz mode it's
also one of those strange situations
where response times are better at 120
Hertz simply because overdrive is
available at that refresh rate I'd be
curious to see how this monitor would
vary overdrive worked at 144 Hertz but
right now I'd suggest most buyers treat
this display as a 120 Hertz panel and
use overdrive to get better performance
than the 144 Hertz mode provides it's a
bit disappointing consuming this is
advertised as a 144 Hertz panel but
that's the way its shipping as for input
lag I've revamped my input lag test for
2019 and I'm currently in the process of
retesting a whole suite of monitors I
still have access to with fresh and more
accurate data unfortunately though that
means I don't have any comparison points
or graphs for you in this review however
I can say the ASUW 49c has very good
input lag characteristics with lag
around the 6.9 millisecond mark
brightness exceeded via text claims
boasting a maximum of 319 it's higher
than the 320 nits listed in the spec
sheet contrast ratio is also
very strong at over 4,500 to 1 again
much higher than the spec sheet lists
however there is a bit of fall-off to
contrast when lowering the brightness at
maximum brightness we're looking at over
forty nine hundred to one but at a more
comfortable 200 nits we're down to 46 63
to one that's what'll fall off isn't
ideal but at least the overall contrast
ratio is still very strong
unfortunately Vitek has made a common
mistake when it comes to color
performance they did not clamp this
monitors gamut - srgb
and there is no mode in the on-screen
display that does so this panel is
capable of wider than srgb gama -
boasting 88% DCI p3 coverage as opposed
to 75% which is typical for an sRGB only
display and that in itself you know it's
not a bad thing if you want to harness a
wider gamut for some use cases however
without a mode that limits the displayed
srgb the su w 49 sees default behavior
is to over saturate colors this is
because your operating system is
providing sRGB image data to the display
which is then stretched to fit the wider
Galant of the monitor and srgb mode
would fix this problem and provide more
accurate performance this issue affects
default color performance such as
saturation and color checker delta-e
averages which are above 3.40 here
indicating mediocre performance the
monitor also ships with an incorrect
white balance of around 7200 K instead
of a proper 6500 K which leads to a blue
tint or cold tone this leads to mediocre
greyscale performance of a three point
six zero Delta II average with weak Gama
while the unclamped gamut cannot be
fixed with the on screen display you can
at least fix the white balance with a
few tweaks I was able to improve
performance however delta ii averages
remain above 2.0 across our grayscale
saturation and color checker test which
is a pre average result ideally you
would want those values under 2.0 or in
the best case under 1.0 but that's not
possible without a full calibration
performing a full calibration using
spectra Cal's calment 5 fixes the gamma
issue and also addresses the rest of the
issues with the panel as you'd expect
we're then left with Delta a averages
under one pointer across the board are
corrected gamma curve and proper white
balance however because these fixes were
achieved with a software profile only
application
that actually support color management
like Photoshop for example we'll apply
the fixes unmanaged apps including the
Windows desktop environment basically
ignore this profile which is why we
prefer monitors they can be corrected
using on-screen controls if you're
interested in our profile we created for
the su w 49 see we have least to
download that through our patreon page
in the description below final aspect of
performance is uniformity and this is
perhaps the worst aspect to the su w 49c
it's hard to get a backlight of this
size with a curve to produce a uniform
output and V attack has struggled here
the outer edges are significantly
different from the center with my review
unit to the tune of Delta YZ above 8.0
and it's reasonably obvious when viewing
solid colors or shades oh and there is
actually one more thing I nearly forgot
about HDR performance given Biotek
advertises this as an HDR capable
monitor I think you may be Viator forgot
about this as well because simply put
this is not an HDR display the HDR
experience is actually worse than
standard SDR because the panel cannot
get the brightness output even in the
right ballpark so I just forget about
the panel supporting HDR and make your
buying decision purely on its SDR
performance all up the vo-tech su w 49c
is going to give you a typical vo-tech
experience it's the same panel and
specifications as bigger manufacturers
like Samsung with a few hundred dollars
shaved off the price you do sacrifice
some performance but the experience is
largely the same which is why it's a
great option for those that want good
bang for buck my main areas of concern
are the lack of overdrive when running
at 144 Hertz which makes the su w 49
City effectively a 120 Hertz display
along with the unclamped color gamut and
poor uniformity the uniformity issue
can't be fixed the color gamut problem
is mitigated to an extent with
calibration and most V air panels can't
truly deliver a 144 Hertz experience
anyway due to slow response times in
fact I suspect a lot of people will get
caught up on the response times of the
su w 49 C but with around 8 millisecond
response is at 120 Hertz that's in line
with most other V air panels I've tested
occasionally you can get the rare unit
that does actually do 144 Hertz but when
you understand that response times are
an issue for all the air pounds it's
really not as bad as at first
outs aside from those issues the SVW 49c
performs well it has an excellent
contrast ratio great input lag it
supports free sync with low framerate
compensation the design is nice and it
has neat features like side by side
picture-in-picture which makes the panel
also decent for productivity due to its
size and aspect ratio it's more of a
niche product but for those after a 32 9
panel you're going to get an experience
pretty close to Samsung's competing
display for about $200 less which is
what we like to see the only reason I'd
offer something like the Samsung c49
HD 90 at this point would be to get its
superior HDR performance but even then
the Samsung chg series doesn't deliver
amazing HDR anyway for all other buyers
and especially those with calibration
tools or those that don't really care
all that much about color accuracy or
over saturation I'd go for the $800
biotech su w 49c instead and that's it
