we're investigating if the core i7 8700
k really performs as advertised by your
favorite media outlets but before we get
into it today's video has been sponsored
by Alliance heroes of the spire file we
have a respectable mobile RPG title it
has over 400 unique heroes that can
combine it over 10,000 different ways
that's very cool the two coolest game
modes include fighting to the death
against crazy giant bosses or battling
real people or even your best friends in
a PvP mode and not to mention really
massive battles between guilds which are
my favorite I really could speak about
this game for hours but it's best you go
check it out for yourselves and now for
the sweetest part download alliance by
the link in the video description you
get a bonus of 50,000 gold and 50 gems
right away go check it out and thank you
alliance for sponsoring this video all
right so before we get into the
benchmarks and even explain what this
video is all about let's just do a bit
of a recap here so Intel rushed out
their eighth generation coffee-like
series late last year and it was
basically a paper launcher try and steal
some attention away from AMD's Rison
processes which were continuing to gain
momentum it was a pretty weak move his
Intel didn't really have supply just a
single high-end chipset was released and
prices were well above the MSRP for
pretty much all of 2017 however
according to some that wasn't even the
real issue rather the issue was
reviewers and I'd say I'm included in
this so reviewers loved what the 8700 K
had to offer in terms of performance and
that rule like the 8700 K is the best
gaming CPU hands-down and if you want
big frame rates then there's no better
choice the issue some seem to have with
this was that our results were
misleading and they didn't represent
what you the consumer were going to be
seeing despite there being zero evidence
of these claims oh and that's consumer
for American viewers who think consumer
sounds ridiculous right what was I
talking about again yes so the results
were misleading there were a few reasons
for these claims a one was the
multi-core enhancement
which is basically at basically
overclocks the cpu let's say and it's
enabled by default on a number of
motherboards some reviewers did get
caught out by this I was well aware of
this feature though so I decided to
disable it though you could certainly
argue that since it is enabled by
default on a number of motherboards it's
just a feature but let's not go down
that rabbit hole for this video
truth is it's essentially overclocking
as it pushes the CPU above the Intel
spec so I've always opted to disable it
so bullet dodged there with the read
fanboys maybe not with the blue variety
but you can't please everyone you really
just have to go with what makes sense to
you so MC is disabled in all our tests
what next the next accusation was that
Intel's TDP ratings for H Gen core
processors is rubbish as they can't hold
their clock speeds at the specified
ratings at least under certain
conditions this all came about because
Intel now only advertised the base clock
frequency that's the minimum frequency
all cords will operate as well as the
single cord turbo frequency the maximum
frequency a single core can achieve they
no longer specify the operating
frequency when two or more cores are
under load
so the 8700 K which has a base frequency
of 3.7 gigahertz might only operate that
frequency if the motherboards power
deliver real cooling solution and up to
the job this is opposed to the 4.3
gigahertz all core frequency most
reviewers such as myself saw so a 14%
drop in frequency could obviously lead
to a decent decline in performance so
what impacts turbo frequencies well the
answer is many things but I'm just going
to mention a four of them here first is
the type of workload this plays a key
role as it often dictates how many cores
are active which then dictates power
consumption and that in turn influences
the operating temperature second is the
ability to remove the heat from the CPU
core this is impacted by the TDP rating
of the CPU package and the heat syncing
system applied to that package third is
the supply and performance capability of
the vrm fourth is the capability in
design of the PCB used by the
motherboard most of us have heard of
examples of catastrophic overheating of
PCBs due to penny-pinching manufacturing
techniques such as to light on the
copper or thin on the tracks for example
if any of these four simple factors are
not designed and implemented correctly
then the CPU will start to heat up and
then self-regulate its frequency and
then of course head down towards the
guaranteed base frequency because
reviewers generally use high-end
motherboards and elaborate cooling
solutions this isn't really an issue as
we essentially show a best-case scenario
but what if you want to buy a budget
motherboard and a cheap cooler how much
performance can you expect to lose well
in the case of the 8700 K as I note in a
moment ago up to around 14 percent would
be possible it's more extreme with the
lower 65 watt TDP model such as the core
i7 8700 there you could drop by up to
26% from the 4.3 you Hertz all called
turbo frequency to the base frequency of
just 3.2 gigahertz it's a similar story
with the core i5 8400 as well so how bad
does the motherboard and cooler need to
be for this to be an issue well late
last year tech sight computer base
reviewed the media on a razor X six
seven zero one five a prebuilt that sold
at Aldi supermarkets they found that
when compared to their core i7 8700 test
system the media on a razor was 13%
slower and Cinebench is ar-15
multi-threaded test and that placed it
behind the Rison 5 1600 X that
particular pre-built uses the Intel box
cool that comes with the 8700 and we are
talking about the non K model here of
course however the real issue here I
suspect is a completely rubbish
motherboard and are we in version made
by none other than ACS now I don't have
many nice things to say about ACS
motherboards so let's skip over most of
my opinion and I'll just say that the
quality of their products has always
been highly questionable so if you're
gonna make the argument that Intel CPUs
can't hold their turbo boost clock
speeds under load
I wouldn't recommend making that
argument with an e CS motherboard that
said I personally don't care about
representing pre built performance and
frankly if they can't make a system that
gets the most out of stock components
that's a problem with the Builder and
not the component maker still I wanted
to look into this issue using cheaper
components than what we typically use as
opposed to a pre-built system made as
cheaply as possible while still working
to maximize margins so I got a few
different cheap said 370 motherboards
and Intel Box cooler a new budget cooler
from silverstone ER representing the
high-end the new corsair h 150 i pro
for the CPU I went with the 95 watt core
i7 87 or okay and I thought that would
be very interesting to see how it got on
with the 73 what box cooler that comes
with the non K model if Intel should be
accused of anything it's that their lakh
CPUs come with complete not a garbage to
cool them their box coolers have almost
always been a joke and the cool that
comes with their 65 watt TDP models is a
complete joke at least when paired with
their expensive six core models moving
on from coolers most of the testing was
done on the msi said 370 a pro but i
also tried the gigabyte said 370 d3 and
the asou stuff said 370 plus gaming all
three boards delivered the exact same
results and those results were in line
with what I got from the MSI's Dad 370
god-like and gigabytes at 370 horas
gaming 7 for example so a view a viewer
of harbor unboxed and presumably other
youtube tech channels as well as a
reader of various tech sites been misled
by reviewers using 8th gen core
processors on high ends at 370
motherboards with expensive $100 plus
coolers well let's go find out before we
get to the benchmark results importantly
talk about temperatures first using the
h 150 i pro courses latest and greatest
all-in-one liquid cooler sporting a
whopping great 360 millimetre radiator
we saw temperatures peak at 79 degrees
after 2 and a half minutes of load and
here the operating frequency held at
four point three gigahertz then 15
seconds later the frequency dropped down
to 4.1 you goats and this allowed
temperatures dropped down to 72 degrees
then for the next 30 minutes
temperatures hovered between 72 and 74
degrees as the operating frequency
jumped between 4.1 and 4.2 gigahertz
been representing the budget air cools
is the rather unimpressive silverstone
AR 0 2 this cooler saw the 8700 k peak
at 91 degrees at four point three
gigahertz after about one and a half
minutes then 10 minutes later it dropped
down to four point one gigahertz with a
temp slower to 77 degrees for the next
30 minutes the temperatures hovered
between 73 and 82 degrees and 76 degrees
was the average across the entire
benchmark test and the operating
frequency sat at 4 gigahertz then we
have the Intel Box cooler that comes
with their 65 watt parts and it's rated
for a maximum of 73 watts of heat
dissipation with the Box cool of the 87
or K peaked at 100 degrees after three
and a half minutes
however the peak 4.3 gigahertz frequency
was here after a minute and a half where
temperatures were reported to be 87
degrees once hitting 87 degrees the
frequency dropped to 3.9 ki Gertz then
3.8 gigahertz then 3.7 gigahertz and
finally 3.6 gigahertz but temperatures
continued to rise
that said though 30 minutes later the
frequency was jumping between 3.7 and
3.8 gigahertz well the temperature
remain locked at a hundred degrees so
using those frequencies as a rough guide
the Silverstone AR 0 2 could result in a
2 to 5 percent reduction in performance
while the entire box cooler could reduce
performance by as much as 14% that being
the case let's move on to see how things
played out I figured Cinebench r15 was a
good place to start and here we see less
than a 1% reduction in the
multi-threaded score when using the AR 0
- opposed to the H 150 Pro that's
certainly within the margin of error
I should note this test was run exactly
a dozen times back-to-back to allow the
CP or each it's typical operating
temperature and I'm reporting the
average result of those 12 runs then
with the Intel Box cooler we see a three
to five percent reduction in performance
from the all-in-one liquid cooler that's
not a lot it's certainly nothing like
the potential 14% reduction I thought we
might see it's also worth noting that
these single core performance was the
same for all three configurations but
that's not terribly surprising a CPU
isn't generating that much heat here
anyway let's move on to a much longer
test this blender workload takes the 87
ok at least 51 minutes to complete and
for that entire period it's under 100%
load again we see virtually no
difference in performance between the 87
on occasion the H 150 I Pro and the
Argonne AR 0 - the results are well
within the margin of error using the
Intel Box cooler did increase the
completion time by 6 percent taking us
for almost 52 minutes - 55 minutes not
an earth-shattering result with a
woefully underpowered cooler but we are
at least seeing a real difference here
when testing with Corona we once again
see there's really no difference between
the budget air cooler and Corsairs might
eh 150 I Pro we do however see a 6%
reduction in performance when using the
flaky little Intel Box cooler the
poverty benchmark also shows no
performance difference between the
all-in-one liquid cooler and the budget
air cooler the Intel box called added
cost performance was dropped by
percent though the 7-zip test was left
looping for an hour and here we see a
little to no difference between the
three tested configurations here the Box
cooler reduced performance by just one
and a half percent which is basically
within the margin of error anyway now
for some gaming benchmarks this is where
things get a little interesting
regardless of which cooler we use the
average frame rate was pretty much the
same and that was not something I was
expecting to see at least not with the
Intel Box cooler however we do see a two
percent drop from the liquid cooler to
the tower style air cooler for the
minimum frame rate then we see an eight
percent reduction from the liquid cooler
to the Intel Box cooler so that's a
decent drop in performance next up we
have f1 2017 and the built in benchmark
runs for just over two minutes and again
we've taken an average of three runs
here we find a similar story to that of
battlefield one though this time the
entire box cooler does fall away a bit
for the average frame rate here the
average performance was down 2% while
the minimum was down 4% those aren't
exactly earth-shattering margins though
finally I tested ashes of the
singularity and here we saw a 2% drop in
the average frame rate when going from
the H 150 I Pro to the Argonne IR zero
to the minimum frame rate was also
reduced by 3% and really this is within
the margin of error the AR 0 2 did
continually come in slower but at times
the margins were just 1% or less but
based on an average of 3 runs this is
the result we've got then with the Box
cooler we see a drop of 6% for both the
average and minimum frame rate I believe
what we're seeing here is a worse case
scenario for gamers all right so we've
seen the results and it's pretty clear
that anyone building their own desktop
system isn't gonna have any trouble
getting the most out of an 8th gen core
processor on an entry levels at 370
motherboard with a cheap and nasty
cooler in fact they don't even have to
be that nasty deep cool of selling made
game ax 200 T for just $8 on you egg and
Amazon that's an insanely good deal I'll
provide links for you guys in the video
description
performance-wise it's very similar to
the silverstone AR 0 - likely a bit
better in fact there are loads of budget
alternatives such as the cooler master
hyper T to the Zelman CNP s 8x optima
and the cryo rig m9 mini tower just to
name a few
that's it if you're spending over
three hundred dollars us on a CPU
probably going to be prepared to spend
at least $30 us on a cooler but what
about the locked processes that come
with Intel's underwhelming Box cooler
CPU such as the core i5 8400 for example
well it's not really a problem
performance wise you're not really
sacrificing anything other than
operating volume and even then it's not
that bad
these 65 watt parts also hit the
expected boost clocks when using the Box
cooler so what's all the fuss about then
honestly it's really hard to say I guess
the fact that Intel's no longer quoting
the boost clock speeds for multi-core
workloads led to a few wild conspiracy
theories for a CPU that can boost as
high as four gigahertz the core i5 8400
sure does have a low base clock
frequency at just 2 gigahertz but the
reason for this is perfectly
understandable all six core 65 watt TDP
models will feature a low base clock and
the reason for this is advanced vector
extensions or AVX for short
AVX is a set of instructions for doing
single instruction multiple data or sim
do operations they built upon previous
offerings such as MMX and SSE and one
way they did this was by expanding to
256-bit wide units from 128-bit both
Intel and AMD support AVX instructions
but while skylight kb lake and coffee
like architectures offered to 256-bit
wide units per core AMD zen architecture
only offers to 128 bit wide units per
core this means when running an intense
AVX workload the intel cpus and more
power-hungry is the wider data pass
require more wires and this leads to
higher power usage the upshot of course
be much greater throughput so if Intel
wants to keep their new locked 6 core
models such as the core i5 8400 within
the 65 watt envelope during AVX
workloads the clock speed has to be
greatly reduced in the case of the 8400
needs to be dropped all the way down at
2.0 gigahertz in order to remain within
the thermal and power limits this was
less of an issue with the previous Core
i5 generation as the kb lake models only
packed for cause at least meant the core
i5 7600 could guarantee a minimum
operating frequency of 3.5 gigahertz
with a turbo frequency of 4.1 gigahertz
so adding two extra colors means Intel's
had to reduce the base clock speed by
20% which seems reasonable if you want
to keep the same 65 watt TDP without a
dash rink so that should explain why
then use 65 watt six core coffee like
parts feature surprisingly low base
clock frequencies I also don't expect
that we'll see anything different in
terms of performance with the upcoming
budget motherboards featuring yet to be
released H 370 and B 360 chipsets
finally there's no chip lottery when it
comes to the advertised clock speeds and
review samples proved to be no different
to the retail chips some overclocked
well and some didn't but they all ran
within an acceptable margin of the
maximum single core turbo frequency all
testing this video was conducted with
retail chips and I've also tested three
different core i5 8400 chips all of
which held a 3.8 gigahertz all core
turbo frequency during non AVX workloads
and that's going to do it for this one
