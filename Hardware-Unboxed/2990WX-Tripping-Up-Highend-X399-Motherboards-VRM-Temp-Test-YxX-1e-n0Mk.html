testing how well the flagship X 399
boards work with the threaded 2990 WX
and we'll be focusing on two vrm
performance and namely thermals I
conducted all this testing a few weeks
ago now but never got around to
releasing all the data and if I waited
much longer it may never have happened
given what we have coming up on the
channel next week so for this test we
have 4 X 399 motherboards we have the
insane MSI Meg x3 and iron creation I
also have the new gigabyte X 399 or s
extreme that's a pretty cool looking
motherboard that
yeah I'm yet to test out and we also
have the tried-and-true a soos rog
zenith extreme so can you give that
board another go and see how it stacks
up to the newer boards and then last but
possibly not least is the asrock X 399
professional gaming since the release of
the 32 core or even just the second gen
3 hearts in general both a soos and as
rocker yet to introduce any new external
motherboards so they have added support
obviously to their existing boards for
the 32 core 2990 WX but I wanted to see
how well it actually works on those
boards before I explain the test method
and then of course go over all the
results I thought we should probably
cover each board and a little bit more
detail go over the vrm design and of
course the cooling used and we will
start with the granddaddy of them all
the MSI mega x3 nine creation and I will
be dropping the mega from the naming
moving forward just because well let's
be honest that sounds pretty crap and
it's just an extra thing to say so we'll
go with x3 now and creation anyway for
those unfamiliar with this beast packs a
genuine 16 phase v Corvair I'm using the
ir35 2:01 controller which supports up
to eight phases each phase is doubled
using an IR three five nine nine phase
doubler which connects to a pair of
Infineon at TDA to one four seven two
power stages for two separate phases
each filter through a six
amp choke the Infineon power stages pack
a 70 amp rating but sadly there's no
publicly available spec sheet for these
parts in any case they are basically
overkill even for the 32 core 2009 WX
and that's what we like to see feeding
power to the board are a pair of dual 8
pin power connectors as amazing as the
verum is it's still going to need a
decent cooler if you plan on
overclocking the 2990 WX so MSI has gone
with a massive pair of aluminium heat
sinks which are connected to one another
via a nickel plated copper heat pipe
sadly these aren't findit sinks which
would have been ideal but instead they
are just slabs of aluminium but even so
given their size and the quality of the
VRM I expect they will still work quite
nicely of course there's much more to
the X 3 9 own creation but I won't dive
into anything else for this video again
the focus is solely on a very informal
performance I would just like to note
though that MSI has included voltage
offset support for this board a
much-needed feature that wasn't present
on the board when we first got it have
the release but the latest bios version
does include that feature so that's
great to see new from gigabyte we have
the x3 99 horas extremely now this is a
very very impressive looking board and
once we take it out of the box and have
a good look at it you will notice that
the varium is quite compact
certainly much more so than the MSI
board that we just looked at they have
managed to squeeze it between the two
banks of DIMM slots what we have here is
another ir35 2:01 controller but whereas
MSI uses all eight phases with doubles
gigabytes using just five phases though
they are again doubling them using the
IR three five nine nine phase doubler
this time though we find IR three five
seven eight power stages which are only
rated for 50 amps this means the board
provides a combined 500 amp capacity and
that is a country mile from the 1020
amps of the MSI board there's still
plenty of power input though you get to
eight pin power connectors but for a
board specifically designed for the 32
core 29 WX
I have to say the X 399 or s extremis
verum is somewhat underwhelming in what
I suspect is an effort to compensate for
the lackluster
varam gigabyte has included real
heatsinks which are actively cooled via
a pair of thirty five-millimeter fans
and this has caused a few mixed feelings
for me on one hand it's great to see
proper fin heat sinks
that's certainly great stuff however
despite that it's quite clear that this
very room is going to be put under the
pump with the 2990 WX as gigabyte has
felt the need to include active cooling
with not just one but rather two fans
gigabyte also claims were using higher
grade thermal pads rated at five watts
per Kelvin rather than the standard 1.8
watts per Kelvin used by most
motherboards the advantage of the
compact vrm is that it's allowed
gigabyte to include four PCIe x 16 slots
with spacing for dual slot cards that
said if you plan on using a massive air
cooler like the Wraith Ripper the
primary slot will be blocked
anyway the X ray no no extreme does have
a lot of nice features such as 10
Gigabit Ethernet dual Intel Gigabit LAN
802 11 AC Wi-Fi and much more I'm just a
little concerned this extreme board
won't be that extreme for those won't
overclock the 2990 WX then as I said
earlier we have the tried and true a
seuss ROG X 399 the zenith extreme
actually X 399 isn't in the name it's
just the south extreme but anyway
doesn't really matter
this particular board can be upgraded
there's a new cooling kit for it but for
this particular test I won't be
modifying the board and using that
cooling kit but be aware if your case
cooling isn't great you can purchase a
few of those additional horrid 40
millimeter fans to plaster over the
verum heatsink prior to the release of
the MSI X 399 creation the zenith
extreme was pretty much the cream of the
crop the granddaddy of the X 399
motherboards it uses an ASP 1 4:05
controller which I'm pretty sure is just
a rebadged ir35 2:01 but for whatever
reason soos tends to be a little bit
special like that anyway what we have
here is a true 8 phase vrm without any
kind of doubling scheme meanwhile
whereas gigabyte used 50 amp IR three
five seven eight power stages a soos has
gone with IR three five five five
power stages which are 60 amp parts and
then we have some 60 amp micro-fine
alloyed chokes a soos uses a slab of
aluminium to cool their eight phase V
core vrm but it connects via a heat pipe
to an actual real heatsink
you know fins and all there's even a 40
millimeter top down fan though honestly
it moves stuff all air and makes way
more noise than it's worth at least in
my opinion anyway I really think like
gigabyte they just need to remove the
stupid plastic shroud over the actual
real heatsink and just let the case
cooling do the work for you it will be
very interesting to see how these Susan
gigabyte boards perform with the twenty
nine ninety WX as one was created with
the new 32 core processor in mind while
the other wasn't and yet they aren't
that different in terms of vrm
capabilities and finally we have the
fatality X 399 professional gaming as
rocks flagship X 399 motherboard like a
soos as rock hasn't gone all out with
the release of the second gen 3rd or 4
CPUs the fact they haven't really gone
out at all instead they've just opted to
stay the course with the three boards
they already had the vrm design is
basically the same as what we found on
the zenith extreme but as Rock hasn't
rebranded the controller so here we have
the ir35 two zero one driving eight
phases using ir35 five power stages with
60 amp chokes so another veeram that's
designed to be more than sufficient for
the thread Ripper 1950 X and therefore
the 21 50 X but I can't see a squeezing
much extra out of a twenty nine ninety W
X on this board cooling wise it's a
pretty basic affair we have an aluminium
slug directly on the power stages and
then this heatsink is connected to a
larger aluminium slab behind the i/o
panel so no finned heat sinks here just
big fat heat reservoirs so will be
interesting to see how the professional
gaming performs in our temperature tests
speaking of which we've pretty much
covered everything we need to hear so
let's move on to discuss the testing
method to apply load to the system I'm
not using a power bug-type program like
prime95 I have nothing against using
that kind of software it certainly has
its place but for this test I want to
use a real-world workload so I went with
a blender workload that takes the 2990
WX a little over 20 minutes to complete
so this test was run three times back to
back
for an hour-long stress test this means
the load results are reported after an
hour of running blender and then the
idle is taken after a 10 minute cooldown
period there are three tests in total
first we'll look at stock results so
out-of-the-box 2990 WX performance then
a four gigahertz overclock using just
one point to five volts and then an
unrealistic extreme stress test again at
four gigahertz but this time using one
point four volts all three tests will be
conducted twice once on an open-air test
bed with no direct airflow over the very
room though note the asou sang gigabyte
boards do feature small fans so they
aren't truly passive and therefore kind
of cheating this test then we have a
second test configuration inside the
corsair 500 d with three 120 millimeter
intake fans in the front two 120
millimeter intake fans in the top and a
single 120 millimeter exhaust fan in the
rear so the top mounted fans are
directing airflow directly over the
board's verum heat sinks then cooling
the CPU was the nmuk slick tech 280
which was mounted in the front of the
case to record the temperatures I'm
using a digital thermometer with k-type
thermocouple x' I've placed multiple
sensors on the surface of multiple power
stages to measure the temperature across
the verum and i will be reporting the
highest value so this means I'll be
measuring the temperature directly on
top of the component between it and the
thermal pad and not an internal
temperature which is bound to be a
little bit higher still with all boards
tested under the exact same conditions
that'll give us a clearer picture of how
the V RMS compare on each board starting
with the open test bed results which
sees no direct airflow over the verum
heat sinks we have the 2990 WX in its
stock configuration again remember the
gigabyte board packs to 35 millimeter
fans while the asou sport has a single
40 millimeter fan and then the MSI and
asrock boards are completely passive
quite shockingly despite featuring too
real heat sinks and to 35 millimeter
fans the gigabyte board managed to
produce the highest of erm temps in this
test and given how these boards compare
on paper I would have never predicted
this it's also very very strange how the
asrock board which doesn't feature any
form of active cooling and also doesn't
feed
any finned heat sinks managed to run
seven degrees cooler under load
meanwhile the Isuzu zennith extreme
which also includes a forty millimeter
fan around its sixteen degrees cooler
than gigabytes or as extreme and was
comparable to the beastly MSI creation
which I should note is 100% passively
cooled so as expected the MSI creation
provides the most impressive result but
it has to be said the asou sport also
does very well okay so time to overclock
and at 4 gigahertz using just one point
to 5 volts the Asura professional gaming
failed the stress test crashing after a
few minutes of heavy load the gigabyte
horas Xtreme shot off well over 100
degrees to hit a peak temperature of 117
degrees and again that's a pretty
shocking result given the board does
pack active cooling meanwhile there
Suisun MSI board saw peak temperatures
increased by about 20 degrees and
although the creation ran six degrees
hotter than the zenith extreme remember
it doesn't feature any kind of active
cooling whereas the asou sport does and
it was quite loud in this test then
finally we have the extreme stress test
using one point four volts and here the
Gigabyte ors extreme had seen enough the
board would randomly power off during
the stress test and it wasn't
temperature related almost every time
the verum didn't get a chance to hit
even eighty degrees before the board
would completely power off and require a
power cycle before it would allow us to
boot back up therefore we are tripping
the board due to a current overload
rather than a thermal issue it seems the
Auris extreme simply can't handle the
power requirements of this test then of
course we have the asrock professional
gaming which also failed this test as it
failed at one point to 5 volts so it was
never going to pass at one point four
volts the Isuzu Zenith extreme appeared
to have no issues with this test and
kept rather cool at 87 degrees and then
we see the MSI creation did run quite a
bit hotter at 99 degrees but for a truly
passive design that's a really
incredible result now if the boards
installed inside the corsair 500 e we
have direct airflow over the very room
heat sinks so this will no doubt help
reduce the load temperatures the
improvement for the asrock board was a
10 degree drop for the load result which
actually isn't too bad that
said the gigabyte board dropped by an
incredible 26 degrees so this tells us
two things
firstly those thirty five-millimeter
fans clearly aren't working very well or
we wouldn't have seen such an extreme
drop when adding more cooling and the
finned heat sinks work extremely well
when fed cool air via case fans the msi
board was more in line with what we saw
from as rocker with airflow it's now 14
degrees cooler while Lea soos board was
11 degrees cooler so with the exception
of the gigabyte board we saw a 10 to 15
degree reduction in temperature when
adding some case cooling the good news
here for gigabyte though being that with
the Auris extreme installed inside the
ATX case the performance was much better
and with a stop 2990 WX it is comparable
to the other high-end msi and of soos
boards okay so time to overclock once
again and here we see that even with the
increased airflow the IROC professional
gaming still can't handle the 4
gigahertz overclock with the 2990 WX
here we see that the MSI creation is now
peaking at 73 degrees which is a 12
degree improvement compared to what we
saw on our open test bench I mean while
the azouz board is now running seven
degrees cooler and this means installed
on our ATX test system that these anyth
extreme ran just one degree cooler than
the msi creation again we see yet
another massive improvement for the
gigabyte or s extreme this time a rather
insane 36 degree drop in temperature as
seen when compared to the open testbed
result which saw the board peak at 117
degrees this result would be far less
surprising if the board didn't feature
two active fans but again I'll talk
about this later in the video finally we
have the most extreme stress test which
sees the 2990 WX reign at 4 gigahertz
using one point 4 volts the Gigabyte
board again failed and once again it
isn't due to a thermal issue but rather
an over draw safeguards shutting the
board off previously on the open test
bed the MSI Croatian hit 99 degrees
making it 12 degrees hotter than the
zenith extreme again the asou sport
features a small active fan whereas the
Croatian doesn't however now with the
aid of case cooling both boards max out
at the same 81 degrees and that is a
super impressive result given the test
conditions
before wrapping up the temperature
testing I decided to get out the IR gun
and measure the temperature of the
vehicle verum heatsink here we're
looking at the highest surface
temperature taken from the top of the
heat sink in the ATX case using these
stock 2990 WX configuration this is
interesting because here we see the
Gigabyte board's heatsink was actually
the coolest as the proper finned heat
sink design dissipates the heat much
more efficiently then we see even with
the help of case cooling the aluminium
bricks on the MSI crash and retain the
most heat while the bricks on the asrock
board were slightly better this is
probably down to the fact that there is
far more surface area on the heatsink
feature on the Azeroth board and it's
also fully exposed whereas MSI shroud
their second larger heatsink in plastic
still it's interesting that despite a
low heat sink temperature the Gigabyte
boards verum still run very hot though
this is likely down to the components
used being of a lesser quality and we
know that are only using 50 amp hour
stages here's a quick look at how the
power stage and heatsink temperatures
compare under the same conditions here
we can clearly see that although the
verum components on the Gigabyte board
are exceeding that of the MSI creation
the top of the heatsink is significantly
cooler meanwhile the MSI creation sees
only a single degree difference between
the power stage and heat sink
temperature so just imagine how well
this board will perform with real heat
sinks of course I'm not saying that it
needs them but damn it
certainly wouldn't hurt okay so I went
into this expecting the MSI x3 knives
you know in creation to be the ultimate
x3 99 motherboard and in terms of power
delivery it certainly is that's it when
it comes to veeram thermal performance
the a sous rog zenith extreme certainly
rivals that board but remember it does
have active cooling whereas the MSI
board is completely passive for extreme
overclocking well beyond what I've
demonstrated in this video
it's likely that the MSI board will
ultimately win out but for your more
typical overclocks using 1.25 to 1.3
volts there really appears to be very
little difference between the sous a
sous and MSI motherboards they both ran
at just over 70 degrees when installed
in the corsair 500 d test system the
gigabyte
$3.99 horas Xtreme that bored it was a
bit of a mixed bag I have to be honest
it appears to be right on the edge with
1.25 volts for overclock and pushing
beyond one point three volts did cause
the board to power trip so we were in
the middle of a test as I said earlier
it didn't appear to be thermal related
it was just completely shut off and we
couldn't power the system on until we
completely power cycled it and then it
would boot back up of course if we
didn't lower the voltage it would just
do it again quite quickly the two thirty
five-millimeter fans they basically or
they appear to be basically useless
while I haven't put that to the test by
removing them and then retesting the
board I can almost guarantee that if you
were to remove the fans and then that
stupid plastic shroud that covers the
large finned heat sink that would
probably yield better results in our ATX
test case still for those of you looking
overclock the 2990 WX verum thermals
appear to be the least of the Auris
extreme as worries as it only hit 81
degrees in our 1.25 volt ATX case test
the real issue is power door and as i
said going much above 1.25 volts at 4
gigahertz caused massive problems for
the gigabyte board just to be clear at
one point three to one point three five
volts the gigabyte board would often
successfully complete multiple blender
runs but really made it to five before
shutting off so this might not be an
issue you see if you run a quick 30
minute stress test for example as for
the asrock X 399 professional gaming
well it had less Headroom with the 2990
WX and the gigabyte or s extreme
basically with the Azeroth board
overclocking is pretty much off the
table and frankly it's not a good
pairing for the 2990 WX and will work
perfectly fine with the 2950 x and
you'll be able to get the most out of
the new 16 core CPU but the 32 core
model is just a bit too much
the 2990 WX is an $1,800 us CPU so I
doubt those in the market for such a
beast are looking to skimp on the
motherboard and this is why the MSI X
399 creation makes so much sense at $580
us it is the most expensive x 399 board
but really in the grand scheme of things
it's not that much more expensive given
what you get
after all it is only 60 to 80 dollars
u.s. more than the Asuza rog zenith
extreme which usually sells for around
five hundred and twenty dollars u.s.
it's only about one hundred and thirty
dollars u.s. more than the gigabyte or
six stream and then about two hundred
dollars more than the Asura professional
gaming and to be fair just under four
hundred dollars u.s. that board really
is a good pairing for a sixteen core
model in my opinion this place is the
gigabyte or as extreme in a bit of an
odd position at four hundred and fifty
dollars u.s. it means that if you spend
seventy dollars more you can get the
zenith extreme and it's a safer bet if
you're going big with the thirty-two
core processor and then you could just
spend another sixty or eighty dollars
and get the MSI creation this choice
becomes even more obvious if you're
buying a motherboard and CPU combo so
that is to say you're buying x3 nine
motherboard with the twenty nine ninety
WX right now in you egg you can snag an
MSI creation and 32 core CPU for about
two thousand two hundred and eighty
dollars or you can get the zenith
extreme bundle for $50 less so that's a
two percent saving and that being the
case I don't know which one I would get
and that is going to do it for this one
hope you guys enjoyed all the testing
that went into getting all the
temperature results for these boards
quite useful if you're going to buy the
32 core processor and probably not as
useful if you want or twenty nine fifty
eight speakers honestly that CPU will
work quite well on any of these
motherboards it really comes down a
price and the feature set them the vrm
will be more than capable anyway I hope
