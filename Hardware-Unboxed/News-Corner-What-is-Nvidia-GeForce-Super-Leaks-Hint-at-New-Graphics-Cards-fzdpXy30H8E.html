the new collection of powerful gaming
laptops the GT 76 Titan in particular is
an absolute beast with its fully fledged
Intel Core I 999 hundred K processor
inside and Nvidia r-tx 2070 graphics
cooled by a unique 4 fan 11 heat pipe
designed for the best performance
it's also worth checking out the GE 65

graphics and attractive design to learn
more click the links in the description
below welcome back to the hardware box
news corner this week has been dominated
by III including AMD's massive suite of
announcements that included a 16 core
rise in CPU Navi GPUs architecture
discussion and more of course I'm not
going to cover all that stuff again in
this video we already have a separate
piece giving you all the juicy details
there but really that was going to be
the major story from this week as far as
hardware is concerned despite that a few
other interesting stories have emerged
including further info on NVIDIA super
teaser a few things we missed from the
AMD announcements and LG's new monitors
which are attracting a bit of attention
so let's get started information
relating to NVIDIA GeForce Super Series
is beginning to heat up and leak out of
the cracks I want to preface this story
by saying that I haven't confirmed the
exact details presented here in the
leaks from video cards and others but
the general tale of the supposed
products and announcements fits with
what I heard at Computex regarding this
release with that said as with any
unconfirmed story think critically and
don't buy and they believe everything
you see
anyway the current information we have
suggests that Nvidia will unveil the
GeForce RT X 20 Super Series next week
but we'll wait until mid-july to
actually launch the products NVIDIA has
only just started briefing partners on
Super so naturally there's a bit of time
required to prepare the products and we
expect that these new GPUs will hit
shelves after ambhi's Navi launch and
this all seems to fit with the whispers
we heard at Computex where AI bees were
generally more clued up about what they
needed to do for na'vi then for the
super launch so what are Nvidia super
graphics cards well
allegedly it's a speck bump for the r-tx
2080 2070 and 2060 to unlock more cuda
cores and in some situations provide a
different memory configuration the r-tx
2080 super for example uses a fully
unlocked tu-104 GPU with 3072 cuda cores
up from 29:44 and gets bumped up to 16
gigabytes per second GDR 6 memory still
in an 8 gigabyte configuration the our
text we 70 super is more interesting
because rather than using a tu 106 GPU
like existing 2070 s it supposedly gets
an upgrade to a cut-down tu-104
with 2560 cuda cores compared to twenty
three or four in existing models however
it retains the same memory configuration
meanwhile the alleged RT X 2060 super
still uses two u 106 but now with 2176
cuda cores instead of 1920 and it gets a
bump from six gigabytes to eight
gigabytes of gddr5 up to 2060 was a bit
stingy on the memory front the
expectation is these new super models
will be released at the price points of
the existing RT x 20 products while the
existing cards will get a price cut
given the rumor suggests the GPUs are
only receiving around five to fifteen
percent more CUDA cores the cards aren't
going to be anything amazing but an
extra 10 percent to performance for the
same price without any change in
architecture for now it's nothing to
sneeze that and should help Nvidia
bridge the gap to the next generation
while keeping competitive with ambhi's
na'vi of course like i said a few
minutes ago this is still largely an
unconfirmed story but I think parts of
this are if anything going to be pretty
close to what we eventually see when in
video reveals the final details which
means July is shaping up as an
interesting month for GPU battles
between AMD and NVIDIA speaking of AMD
GPUs one thing I forgot to mention in my
initial coverage of AMD's III
announcements is the RX 5700 xt 50th
anniversary edition this card was
unveiled during ambhi's live stream but
wasn't provided to us ahead of time but
I'll get you up to speed now just in
case you missed it the 50th anniversary
edition doesn't do anything radically
different it does have a black and gold
cooler design as opposed to the standard
red for AMD's Radeon cards but the
general blower design is the same so
it's not like Vega where the top-end
Vega
sixty-four was also available in a more
powerful liquid-cooled model the GPU
configuration is the same as the rx 5700
XT with 2560 stream processes but it
gets a slight overclock from a 1605
megahertz base to a 16 80 megahertz base
this should translate into a
seventy-five megahertz high game clock
for around four percent more raw
performance the card is priced at five
hundred dollars compared to four hundred
and fifty dollars for the regular rx
5700 XT so you're definitely paying a
bit of a premium for the 50th
anniversary branding here given we
expect most regular rx 5700 XTS to
achieve a seventy-five megahertz
overclock the selling point here is
definitely the cooler design so probably
only a product for the hard core AMD
fans but nevertheless at least AMD is
providing a slight performance boost out
of the box rather than just giving you a
cooler and nothing else
USB four is on track for release by the
end of 2020 according to an antique who
recently spoke to the USB promoter group
the specification is currently sitting
in version 0.7 and progressing quickly
which is why the group believes devices
featuring us before should be ready by
the end of next year earlier this year
USB 3.2 was unveiled with speeds up to
20 gigabits per second but the naming
scheme was pretty stupid and confusing
for customers with us before there's
hope that both fronts will improve the
spec should bring speeds of up to 40
gigabits per second as the technology is
based on Intel's now royalty-free
Thunderbolt 3 protocol it should also
allow for backwards compatibility with
older protocols including Thunderbolt 3
over the same type C cables and support
simultaneous data and display streams
the best news is probably that the USB
promoter group are considering a new
logo and branding for us before which
will hopefully stop the ridiculous
situation where older USB protocols are
renamed with each new generation the
final spec is expected to be published
in the next few months LG has detailed
two new monitors that claim to be the
world's first IPS panels with a one
millisecond greater grave response time
the models in question are the LG 27 gl
850 and the 38 GL 950 G both are fairly
unique and generating a lot of interest
- now patreon exclusive discord chat and
for those that keep asking yes I request
a review unit so hopefully
get those in when available the 27 GL
850 is a 27-inch 1440p 144 Hertz panel
that's g-sync compatible in other words
it's a free sink slash adaptive sink
monitor that comes in video certified it
uses a flat nano IPS panel with 98% DCI
p3 coverage meanwhile the 38 GL 950 G is
a unique 38 40 by 1600 ultra wide at 37
point 5 inches in size so it's still a
21-9 monitor but provides a slightly
higher resolution and size than standard
34 40 by 1440 panels crucially it also
supports up to a 175 Hertz refresh rate
when overclocked as well as 98% DCI p3
coverage through nano IPS technology and
display hgr 400 certification and it
supports g-sync the key selling point
here are those claimed one millisecond
response times for an IPS panel which
would be super compelling if true given
that even the best IPS panel thursdays
are more around the 4 millisecond mark
but i do remain a bit skeptical here
given many monitor companies like to
fudge around with these response time
metrics while they claim this is a
greater gray measurement is it the
average or just the fastest response it
can achieve have to test that when I get
my hands on with it pre-orders for the
monitor yes that's a thing now opened on
July 1st and from what I hear they are
expected to be available later that
month this next story is an interesting
one I spotted on Tech's spot this
morning and upcoming Windows 10 update
will break some Bluetooth devices that
remain unsecured the security update CVE
2019 21:02
intentionally prevents connections
between the OS and floor devices
specifically those that use well-known
encryption keys such as some security
fogs to know if your device can't pay it
due to this latest upgrade you'll have
to head into the event log and look for
a specific event name which is great for
advanced users but we'll certainly
frustrate more casual users that won't
know why their device doesn't work and
naturally given this is the security
concern Microsoft advised it if you are
affected you should contact the
manufacturer of your Bluetooth device to
see if an update exists to correct the
security issue Microsoft really aren't
offering a workaround here and see the
trick if there's an update or simply not
roll out the update to your device final
topic for this week just wanted to touch
on some of the new
ray-tracing announcements out of a3 not
going to cover every single game talked
about at the show or we'd be here for
hours but I did like how several major
announcements were accompanied by talk
of ray tracing I know a lot of people
are big ray tracing haters and we
certainly shared our criticisms of
invidious art X platform previously but
realistically the more games that
support ray tracing the bigger the
ecosystem will grow and the better
implementations will become it all has
to start from somewhere and the end
result should be better graphics for PC
gamers especially when we have all of
Nvidia AMD and Intel supporting ray
tracing to some extent in the next few
years anyway I was surprised to see many
of the big launch is supporting ray
tracing cyberpunk 2077 watchdogs Legion
the reboot of call of duty modern
warfare vampire the masquerade
bloodlines - and doom eternal round out
the major games to include ray tracing
plus of course a few others that has
very quickly doubled the number of
popular titles set to use ray trace and
I think we'll see even more come the
next generation of consoles which is
said to support ray tracing as well and
that's it for this week's news cone a
bit of a shorter one given those huge
announcements earlier this week don't
forget to check out Steve's
investigation into whether the latest
update to Windows 10 has really improved
performance for Ryze and owners
