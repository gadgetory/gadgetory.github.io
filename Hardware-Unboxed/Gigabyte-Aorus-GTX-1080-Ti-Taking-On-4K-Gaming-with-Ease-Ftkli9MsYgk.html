have a shiny new graphics card from
gigabyte or is it Oris gigabyte horas
anyway this time around it's a little
less confusing because there is just a
single Extreme Edition version of their
new GT X 1080 Ti this latest extreme
model falls under the Auris branding
while the gigabyte 1080 TI uses the more
traditional windforce 3x cooler back in
February I got my first look at a Norris
Brown product the GTX canady Extreme
Edition I want two superb graphics card
it was in terms of looks in design I
think the Auris extreme was the best
example of a GT x 1080 I've seen so
what's their new 1080i model like well
without going any further I can quite
comfortably say that this graphics card
is going to be awesome
simply given the fact that it is based
on the same design as the previous horas
TT X 1080 extreme edition they looked at
of course the GPU has been swapped out
and upgraded to the 1080 TI version
there's also a little more gddr5 memory
it's also a bit faster as well so
standard 1080 Ti stuff then it's almost
disappointing there isn't anything
radically new to explore that said
though the previous model is only a few
months old and it did bring about a
number of refinements over the Gigabyte
extreme models that came before it the
Auris extreme kept the GTX 1080 at
around 60 degrees when gaming and even
with the maximum overclock applied it
didn't hit 70 degrees perhaps more
impressive was how quite the card
remained went under maximum low to date
I've only checked out the Nvidia founded
edition of the GT x 1080 Ti and that
quickly hits around 80 degrees when
gaming and will go as high as 84 degrees
before it starts to throttle and that's
with an ambient room temperature of 21
degrees so it's a hot bit of kit and not
in a good way
this means overclocking with the
founder's Edition is likely compromised
due to this high operating temperature
so I'm keen to see what the Auris model
can do as this is essentially the same
cooler found on the GTX 1080 Ti model
reviewed a few months ago I will just
quickly cover a few of the important
details the largest detail of them all
is of course that mass
wind forced a cooling system which
employs three 100 millimeter fans
featuring an innovative overlapping
design one of the coolest features
though can be found on the backside of
the graphics card that awesome looking
or ass backplate with the copper insert
previously gigabyte claims the copper
insert reduced the GPU load temperature
by three degrees the claim being that it
did this by removing built-up heat on
the backside of the PCB mixed results
were found no and it seemed for the most
part the conference that made little to
no difference honestly though I wasn't
too concerned by this and it is
difficult to prove false advertising
here of course the main reason I didn't
really care about this like most people
is I thought it looked awesome and it
really helped to the extreme edition
standout the copper plate also featured
small raised fins which help to
dissipate heat by maximizing the surface
area additionally there were also a few
thermal pads found on the backplate
which helped remove built-up heat from
the VRMs adding a bit of bling to the
card is of course RGB lighting the LED
power ex illuminates the center of the
shroud while there's another LED powered
Oris logo and brand name on the side
creating an awesome effect for those
with case windows there's also a large
LED logo on the back plate as well so
gigabytes RGB game is again on point
here removing the cooler reveals a
massive copper base that covers not just
the GPU but also the gddr5 X memory
chips
there's also six very long six
millimeter thick copper heat pipes
snaking their way through two large
arrays of aluminium fins by removing the
cooler we now have access to the PCB and
what we have here is a completely
reworked masterpiece that measures 267
millimeters long and 121 millimeters
tall gigabyte has employed a 12 plus to
power phase design which when compared
to the seven phase in video reference
design should allow the extreme Edition
to work at lower temperatures and
provide more stable voltage output both
of which should improve overclocking and
extend the life of the card another cool
feature is the aerospace-grade
PCB coating which gigabyte claims
protects the graphics card and all its
vital components from dust insects
drop screws drill shavings and abrasion
probably more useful for power users
other moisture resistant properties
which are said to prevent unwanted
contour
paths that ultimately lead to boy
failure the card is also backed by the
extreme care four year warranty though
it isn't entirely clear if the warranty
covers water damage moving on we find
dual eight pin PCI Express power
connectors capable of feeding the
graphics card up to three hundred and
thirty Watts at the end of the PCB there
is an internal hdmi connector which is
designed to connect to the extreme VR
link module interestingly gigabyte had
previously included two HDMI connectors
here but now we only get one unlike the
extreme gaming models that we've checked
out previously the extreme additions
don't appear to come in a premium pack
which includes the VR link module so
this would have to be purchased
separately those of you want to do a
little bit of overclocking can turn to
the Auris xtreme software which works
very well the software enables easy
overclocking and allows the user to
increase the thermal target as well as
the power target the user can monitor
the GPUs vitals and easy overclocking
modes exist along with a more complex
manual overclocking option voltage
states can be adjusted and custom fan
curves can also be created finally the
all-important igb lighting can be
configured here and there's a few of the
more standard effects to play with out
of the box the card comes at a base
clock speed of sixteen hundred and seven
megahertz which allows for a boost clock
of at least seventeen hundred and twenty
one megahertz there is an OC mode which
can be enabled the click of a button and
this boost the base to sixteen hundred
and thirty two megahertz resulting in a
boost clock speed of at least seventeen
hundred and forty six megahertz this
means out of the box the card comes with
a 9 percent factory overclock so not bad
still if you prefer to apply your own
overclock let's see what can be achieved
with a little bit of tinkering the core
was able to accept a frequency of
sixteen hundred and fifty-two megahertz
while the gddr5 X memory was good for
fifteen hundred megahertz or a transfer
speed of twelve gigabits per second of
course due to the way in videos GPU
boost 3.0 works we know the card can run
faster than the suggested boost clock
speed is kept under the thermal and
power targets in the case of the Extreme
Edition this allowed the card to hold an
operating frequency of two thousand and
fifty megahertz after a 20-minute stress
test which was most impressive for those
wondering in it out-of-the-box
configuration the card operated at or
above 1886
megahertz under load before I do jump to
the benchmarks please note this won't be
a detailed benchmark review in terms of
frame rate performance we already know
where the 1080 Ti is positioned we're
mostly interested in how much faster
this horas version is than the founders
Edition and we won't require more than a
few games to work that out testing with
battlefield one at 1440p we find the
Auris gtx 980ti
is good for an average of 113 fps using
the ultra quality settings not bad
although this is just 4% more
performance from the founders edition
overclocked we were able to extract 7%
more performance from the Auris card
hitting a very impressive 142 FPS on
average while never dipping below 128
fps now at 4k we find the Auris card is
6% faster than the founders Edition and
impressively 30% faster than the GTX
1080 extreme edition overclocked we were
able to extract a further 5% allowing
for 78 FPS with a minimum of 70 FPS
that's pretty incredible formance at
this extreme resolution moving a Far Cry
primal the margins look much the same to
what we're seeing when testing with
battlefield 1 the Auris GT x 1080 TI is
just 5% faster than the founders edition
and once again overclocked it's squeezed
out 7% more performance I was however
impressed with the fact that out of the
box this new OS GTX 1082 I was 31
percent faster than the older gigabyte
GTX today extreme edition now 4k the
Auris GT x 1080 2 I can be seen
delivering 34% more frames than the
gigabyte GT X 1080 extreme edition so
again that is extremely impressive it
was also nice to see that once
overclocked we were able to break the 60
FPS barrier the last game I'm going to
benchmark with is for honor and this
time we find the Auris gtx 980ti
delivering 8% more frames than the
founders Edition once again 7% more
performance was achieved by overclocking
and this made the overclocked Dorris
1080 Ti an impressive 41% faster than
the gigabyte GT x 1080 extreme edition
the 4k performance was also very
impressive and here we again find that
once overclocked the horas GTX 1082 is
able to break the 60 FPS barrier when it
comes to power consumption the gigabyte
cards are generally power-hungry
critters here we can see that the
vanilla GT x 1080 from gigabyte sucks
more juice in the 1080i model from
Nvidia
meanwhile the or SD T X 1080 T I push
total system consumption 15% higher than
the founders edition model and 30%
higher once overclocked I have to admit
I was pretty surprised to see the RS gtx
980ti reach 71 degrees in our stress
tests I realize that the founders
Edition is still a good bit hotter at 84
degrees but even so I was expecting the
Auris card to sit somewhere in the 60s
however upon closer inspection I noticed
how slow the fans were spinning at
around 1500 rpm the founders Edition for
example hums along at 2,300 rpm and
while far from loud it can be heard over
my case fans
therefore I manually increase the fan
speed to 2,000 rpm which had no
noticeable impact on the operating
volume and yet temperatures plummeted to
just 63 degrees that's more than a 20
degree improvement over the founders
Edition while still maintaining a
quieter operating volume well this
probably won't surprise many of you but
I really love gigabytes new horas GT X
1080 Ti extreme edition there really
isn't much in the way of bad things to
say about this graphics card pretty much
awesome but said a few small details
while vastly superior to the previous
generation gigabyte extreme edition
graphics cards the fan shroud is still a
bit flimsy the aluminium is quite thin
though they've done quite a good job of
reinforcing it so doesn't Bend all over
the place and of course they have kept
it thin to keep the weight down because
this card already weighs 460 grams so
it's a bit of a porker so yeah gigabyte
couldn't afford to overdo it with the
fan shroud also that big copper insert
on the back probably doesn't help with
the weight either but it looks freaking
cool I guess you could complain about
the card's enormous weight and claim
that at risk damaging your motherboard
or that the triple slot design makes it
a bit of a man spreader but none of
those things bother me if it's not
cracking a keg don't bother charging
over $700 u.s. and the more slots it
takes up the more impressive it looks
and the more reassured I am that
spending this much money on a gaming
graphics card was the right choice on a
more serious note the software while
quite powerful does look a tad dated and
the interface is a little clumsy
it also doesn't scale well on a 4k
display so I
a hell of a time fine tuning the
overclock with my magnifying glass but
what about the good stuff I hear you ask
well it's big really big did I mention
that the reason this is a good thing is
because that big heavy cooler means that
even when overclocked through the Macs
it runs very cool and quiet especially
if you tweak the fan profile it's not
just a big intimidating lump of a
graphics card either the Auris Extreme
Edition lights up like a Christmas tree
and I think by now it's well-established
that all gamers love RGB lighting
despite the slightly flimsy fan shroud
overall build quality is excellent and
gigabyte appears to have made good use
of high quality components overall
performance was excellent of course I
wasn't expecting it to be world's faster
than the founders edition model we
pretty much know what to expect from
board partner cards built around the
Pascal GPUs at this point that of course
being a dramatic improvement in thermal
performance with a very minor bump in
fps performance priced at $750 u.s. or
1240 Yazzie gigabytes flagship horas
brown GG X 1080 Ti is surprisingly well
priced I mean yeah by GT X 1080 TI
standard that's well priced of course
it's still expensive because it is a GT
X 1080 CI but given that the base models
start at $700 u.s. or eleven hundred and
thirty Australian you aren't exactly
paying a huge premium for this truly
massive graphics card it's around a 10%
markup for us kangaroo riding Aziz which
is a bit but then the asou Strix model
cost thirteen hundred and eighty dollars
so by comparison the Auris is a bargain
anyway let's wrap this up shall we I can
highly recommend the gigabyte or s GT X
1080 Ti to anyone seeking the ultimate
single GPU solution because that's
exactly what it is I'm your host Steve
see you again soon guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
