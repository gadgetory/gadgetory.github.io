benchmark video I've jumped headfirst
into useable fall which I might add is
thankfully a significantly better
quality game Gears of War 4 is exciting
for a few reasons most notably of which
is the fact that it should be the first
game to truly leverage the capabilities
of the Unreal Engine 4 the game is built
on the 4.11 version which is a more
recent build featuring full DirectX 12
support asynchronous computers been
leveraged heavily so it'll be
interesting to see how the AMD nvidia
gpus compare both AMD and NVIDIA do have
game ready drivers forgivable for though
I should point out that Nvidia work
closely with developer the Coalition on
the game therefore we expect the GeForce
graphics cards might have an advantage
over their radiant rivals at least
initially this is the first DirectX 12
title that hasn't been tailored to aim
DS Hardware get man and dose X come to
mind for example so again it'll be
interesting to see how things pan out
for testing we stuck to the built in
benchmark which seems to do a good job
of replicating actual gameplay the ultra
quality preset was enabled with a sync
turned on each time we changed the
resolution or reloaded the game with a
different graphics card the ultra preset
needed to be reapplied so this was done
before each run as usual the latest
display drivers were installed for
testing and my core i7 6700 K test rig
was used before we get into the
benchmark results here's a quick look at
the built in benchmark test
anyone
those of you rocking a previous
generation GPU be pretty happy with the
performance at 1080p with the game maxed
out even the little old gtx 950
maintained over 30 FPS for an average of
40 we know the gtx 960 isn't
particularly fast at the nvidia
reference clock speeds and this does
hand the r9 380 the win still at 17%
faster the 380 was a good bit faster at
the stop clocks
bumping the resolution up to 1440p we
see that it takes the i-93 ATX to stay
above the dreaded 30fps for a smoother
more consistent experience the gtx 970
or r9 390 you'll be required meanwhile
the fury action gtx 980ti closely
battled each rendering over 60 FPS on
average as it might expect 4k gaming on
a single GPU isn't possible using
previous generation hardware the fury
acts despite its limited 4 gigabyte
frame buffer was king here with an
average of 34 yes in video's current
generation lineup which is yet to
feature any truly affordable GPUs has no
trouble delivering over 60 FPS at all
times at 1080p the RX 480 and 470 were
both very impressive as well Dericks 460
struggled but given the quality settings
the results are still very impressive
1440p performance and Gears of War 4 is
still very good on the GTX 1063 gear ID
and rx 470 both delivering nice playable
performance still for those of you who
can't fair to dip below 60fps the gtx
1070 will be required now at 4k gamers
can scrape by with the gtx 1070 though
the 1080 performance was noticeably
better of course if you can afford to
meet in videos extreme pricing demands
to the tight next then smooth 4k
experience can be hard period in sky is
old 19 GPUs side-by-side at 1080p the
results have been discussed but this
graph makes it easy to compare AMD and
videos previous generation lineup with
their current gear here are the 1440p
results if you need time to study them
feel free to pause the video
alternatively you can easily find your
way back here using the video index in
the description finally here at 4k we
see there are just a few select GPUs
capable of playable performance
meanwhile you can even select the 4k
resolution with a graphics card limited
to a 2 gigabyte frame buffer
which is probably a good thing I bet you
guys thought we were done well not quite
yet let's see what kind of impact Aysen
compute does or doesn't have on
performance as you can see the GTX 1060
didn't gain much from having a sink
enabled and this has become quite a
common theme you could draw the
conclusion that the Pasco GPUs can't
take advantage based in computer or they
simply don't need to as they're already
operating at or near maximum efficiency
from the Red Team web the rx 480 which
gained around 6% more performance today
sink computer neighborhood when looking
at the minimum frame rates so a nice
little boost for AMD here and that
little extra performance helped to close
the gap on the gtx 1060
so what about cpu performance let's take
a look at cpu utilization on the core i7
test machine running the type next for
the purpose of these tests I've dropped
the clock speed down to three and a half
key guards with turbo disabled at this
frequency utilization set around 40
percent in the benchmark direct times
did rise up as high as 70 percent this
was in line with actual game players by
large CPU utilization sat between 30 and
40 percent given these findings there
shouldn't be a noticeable difference in
performance between say a Core i5 and a
core i7 processor and the game should
also be playable using a core i3 so
there you have it
Gears of War 4 is a great looking game
and more importantly is very well
optimized for PC hardware
although NVIDIA has had a lot to do with
the development of the game it's nice to
see it running so well in AMD hardware
as well was also great to find such
strong performance not only on the
latest gen hardware but also on previous
generation stuff as well at this point I
can see the Gears of War 4 to be a true
DirectX 12 title it's certainly one of
the best-looking and most polished
examples we have so far as I found in
the past when playing around with async
compute support in games there's little
to no benefit for NVIDIA while AMD gains
five to ten percent more performance
thanks to the game's DirectX 12 support
driver overhead doesn't appear to be an
issue for AMD this not only helps boost
performance at resolutions such as 1080p
but it means load on the CPU has also
been reduced as such the CPU doesn't
appear to be worked that hard and for
the most part with the core i7 6700k
clocked down and locked at three and a
half gigahertz utilization such
forty percent so what do you guys think
how many of you gonna get into Gears of
War for let me know in the comments I'm
your host Matt as always and I'll see
you guys next time cheers guys for
joining me for another episode of
hardware unbox so those of you that
already support the channel thank you so
much it's truly appreciated and to those
of you that would like to support the
channel directly I do have Amazon links
and a patreon link in the video
description below thanks a lot and I'll
see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
