benchmark video I've jumped headfirst
into usable for which I might add is
thankfully a significantly better
quality game Gears of War for is
exciting for a few reasons most notably
of which is the fact that it should be
the first game to truly leverage the
capabilities of the Unreal Engine 4 the
game is built on the 4.11 version which
is a more recent build featuring full
DirectX 12 support asynchronous
computers been leveraged heavily so
it'll be interesting to see how the AMD
and NVIDIA GPUs compare both AMD and
NVIDIA do have game ready drivers for
usable for though I should point out
that Nvidia work closely with developer
the Coalition on the game therefore we
expect the geforce graphics cards might
have an advantage over the radium rivals
at least initially this is the first
DirectX 12 title that hasn't been
tailored to amd's Hardware get man and a
sax come to mind for example so again
it'll be interesting to see how things
pan out for testing we stuck to the
built-in benchmark which seems to do a
good job replicating actual gameplay the
ultra quality preset was enabled with a
sink turned on each time we change the
resolution or reloaded the game with a
different graphics card the ultra preset
needed to be reapplied so this was done
before each run as usual the latest
display drivers were installed for
testing and my core i7 6700 k test rig
was used before we get into the
benchmark results here's a quick look at
the built-in benchmark tests
anyone else
those of you rocking a previous
generation GPU will be pretty happy with
the performance at 1080p with the game
maxed out even the little old gtx 950
maintained over 30 FPS for an average of
forty we know the gtx 960 isn't
particularly fast at the Nvidia
reference clock speeds and this does
hand the r9 380 the win still at
seventeen percent faster the 380 was a
good bit faster at the stock clocks
bumping the resolution up to 1440p we
see that it takes the i-93 ATX to stay
above the dreaded 30fps for a smoother
more consistent experience the gtx 970
or r9 390 will be required meanwhile the
fury axe and gtx 980 TI closely battled
each rendering over 60 FPS on average as
you might expect 4k gaming on a single
GPU isn't possible using previous
generation hardware the fury axe despite
its limited 4 gigabyte frame buffer was
king here with an average of 34 FPS and
videos current generation lineup which
is yet to feature any truly affordable
GPUs has no trouble delivering over 60
FPS at all times 1080p the RX 480 and
470 were both very impressive as well
Derek's 460 is struggled but given the
quality settings the results are still
very impressive 1440p performance and
gears of war 4 is still very good on the
GTX 1063 gigabyte and RX 470 both
delivering nice playable performance
still for those of you who can't bear to
dip below 60 FPS gtx 1070 will be
required now at 4k gamers can scrape by
with the gtx 1070 though the 10 80s
performance was noticeably better of
course if you can afford to meet and
videos extreme pricing demands to the
tight next then smooth 4k experience can
be had period is guys all 19 GPU side by
side at 1080p there has also been
discussed but this graph makes it easy
to compare AMD and videos previous
generation lineup with their current
gear here are the 1440p results if you
need time to study them feel free to
pause the video alternatively you can
easily find your way back here using the
video index in the description finally
here at 4k we see there are just a few
select GPUs capable of playable
performance meanwhile you can't even
select the 4k resolution with a graphics
card limited to a 2 gigabyte frame
buffer
which is probably a good thing I bet you
guys thought we were done well not quite
yet let's see what kind of impact async
compute does or doesn't have a
performance as you can see the gtx 1060
didn't gain much from having a sink
enabled and this has become quite a
common theme you could draw the
conclusion that the Pascal GPUs can't
take advantage basic computer or they
simply don't need to as they're already
operating at or near maximum efficiency
from the red team we have the RX 480
which gained around six percent more
performance nascent computer
neighborhood when looking at the minimum
frame rates so a nice little boost for
AMD here and that little extra
performance help to close the gap on the
GTX 1016 so what about CPU performance
let's take a look at cpu utilization on
the core i7 test machine running the
type next the purpose of these tests
I've dropped the clock speed down to
three and a half years with turbo
disabled at this frequency utilization
SAT around forty percent in the
benchmark though at times did rise up as
high as seventy percent this was in line
with actual game players by large cpu
utilization SAT between thirty and forty
percent given these findings there
shouldn't be a noticeable difference in
performance between say a core i5 and a
core i7 processor and the game should
also be playable using a core i3 so
there you have it Gears of War for is a
great looking game and more importantly
is very well optimized for PC hardware
although NVIDIA has had a lot to do with
the development of the game it's nice to
see it running so well in AMD hardware
as well was also great to find such
strong performance not only on the
latest gen hardware but also on previous
generation stuff as well at this point I
can see the gears of war for to be a
true DirectX 12 title it's certainly one
of the best-looking and most polished
examples we have so far as I found in
the past when playing around with async
compute support in games there's little
to no benefit for NVIDIA while AMD gains
five to ten percent more performance
thanks to the game's DirectX 12 support
driver overhead doesn't appear to be an
issue for AMD this not only helps boost
performance at resolutions such as 1080p
but it means load on the CPU has also
been reduced as such the CPU doesn't
appear to be worked that hard and for
the most part with a core i7 6700 k
clock down and locked at three and a
half gigahertz utilization sat just as
40
sent so what do you guys think how many
of you going to get into usable for let
me know in the comments i'm your host
mandas always and i'll see you guys next
time cheers guys for joining me for
another episode of hardware on box to
those of you that already support the
channel thank you so much it's truly
appreciated and those of you would like
to support the channel directly i do
have amazon links and a patron link in
the video description below thanks a lot
and i'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
