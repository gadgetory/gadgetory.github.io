kind of interesting CPU or GPU gaming
type video the comments section quickly
fills up with requests for cue 6600
testing for those of you who don't know
or have simply forgotten the core 2 quad
q6600 it's an almost ten-year-old
Kentfield 65 nanometer processor which
as the name suggests boastful caused
Ken's field was Intel's first have a
quad core architecture and the cue 6600
was the company's first mainstream
offering in a cool 530 US dollars upon
release out of the box that operated all
four cores at 2.4 gigahertz and ran on
266 megahertz front side bus ah the good
old days as Intel's first mainstream
quad core processor the Q 6600 was
incredibly popular and the fact that
almost a decade later so many of you are
asking for modern benchmarks using it is
a testament to this therefore I decided
to do some second-hand shopping and pick
up a Q 6600 system for as little as
possible for around a benchmarking
looking on ebay didn't prove
particularly useful as Australian
selling here seem to think they're
crusty old dust infested q 6600 systems
are increasing in value as they age
despite my best Michael cotton
impression town they're dreaming didn't
seem to help so I moved on checking
local computer forums is where I had the
most success and having just missed out
on a few Q 6600 rigs that sold for less
than $30 dollars I landed on a real gem
for 40 Australian dollars which is
roughly thirty US I managed to land a
Core 2 quad Q 9300 system with 4
gigabytes of memory decent power supply
case mechanical storage and inaud
geforce gtx 560 TI graphics card the q
90 300 is decent step up from the q 6600
as well this 45 nanometer part codenamed
York field 6 M runs on a faster 333
megahertz front side bus so out of the
box it offers a bit more of a punch
it can also be overclocked to over 3
gigahertz which is handy for netting a
bit of extra performance what I wanted
to know was is it even worth investing
the time it takes to not only locate one
of these old systems at a fair price
then set it up and of course use it if
all you plan on doing is playing games
such as League of Legends that were
on a potato then yes I suspect the
investment will be worth it but what if
you have expectations are playing more
recent more demanding titles such as
overwatch and even Star Wars Battlefront
for example can an old Core 2 quad
system offer you anything this is what I
wanted to find out so I picked up half a
dozen popular games including Star Wars
Battlefront League of Legends overwatch
counter strike global offensive dota 2
and the ever-popular rocket League the
Core 2 quad q 9300 system with the
geforce gtx 560 TI was tested in the
condition i received in indicee what
kind of results were achievable without
any upgrades the gtx 560 TI was then
swapped out for the recently released
radiant RX 460 see what kind of headroom
there was in the processor in order to
do that we also overclocked 2q 9302 3.25
gigahertz to see how hard it could push
the RX 416 finally if a comparison sake
I ran the same games using the same
settings on the RX 460 with it installed
in my core i3 and core i7 test rigs I
thought this might provide an
interesting insight to see how this
almost ten-year-old quad-core compares
to intel's current range so with that
said let's get on with it first up let's
get League of Legends out of the way I
know this is an insanely popular video
game but let's face it the game runs on
pretty much anything proving this we
find a very playable 49 FPS average on
the Q 9300 rig using the gtx 560 TI
1080p using the maximum in-game quality
settings throwing the RX 416 didn't
really improve performance much that
said overclocking the q 9302 3.2 5
gigahertz did boost the performance by
almost 30% with the rx 460 when compared
to a modern low voltage core i3 system
the overclocked 290 300 only delivered
around half the performance and the core
i7 rig was naturally much faster again
still in terms of value for money it's
hard for League of Legends gamers to do
better especially given this isn't a
game that needs extreme frame rates so
what about the other massively popular
online battle arena game dota 2 the gtx
560 TI did provide playable performance
here if only just an average of 36 FPS
is playable but we found considerably
better performance when using the rx 416
the average frame rate jumped up to 62
fps a massive 72% increase an additional
10% more was also found through
overclocking again that's around
the performance of a modern core i3
system the q90 300 and GTX 560 Ti combo
performed exceptionally well in csgo
using the very high quality settings at
1080p along with eight times msaa the
system has no trouble exceeding 60 FPS
average that's pretty nuts not only that
but army with the rx 460 boosts the
average framerate to well over 100 fps
in over 140 fps once overclocked even
when compared to the latest and greatest
skylake systems the 290 300 didn't look
too bad here my personal favorite is
rocket League and I was a bit
disappointed with the gtx 560 TI here
using the performance quality settings
with a a disabled we did average 31 fps
though constant frame drops made for a
lag experience replacing the GeForce
graphics card with the rx 462 wonders
for this system not shocked by the
performance now with averages in excess
of 100 FPS the game is fantastic to play
and most importantly lag free I'm not
really sure why the GTX 560 T I was so
useless here despite a shockingly poor
result for the GTX 560 Ti when playing
rocket League we found rather decent
performance and overwatch
the 44 FPS minimum suggests perfectly
smooth performance though I have to
admit the game was at times quite
stuttery overclocking the q90 300
corrected this and with the RX 460 it
was perfectly smooth keep in mind my
over watched test does feature two full
teams of bots so it is very CPU
intensive so how about a modern triple-a
title them well unfortunately playable
performance just wasn't achievable with
the q90 300 and GTX 560 Ti combo in with
the low quality settings which I did try
swapping out the 560 Ti for the RX 460
solved the performance issues in the
game jumped up to a playable 46 FPS
average overclocking the Q 90 300
boosted performance by massive 35% and
we were now looking at an average of 62
FPS which wasn't a great deal slower
than a core i3 test system in fact with
no cpu bottleneck at all the RX 460 is
only capable of 69 FPS it's been some
time since I've games on a Core 2 quad
system so if anything the experience is
interesting the game is on seriously
tight budgets the dual quad core systems
can offer a decent gaming experience
especially if you get lucky with the GPU
how much of a bargain the Core 2 quad
computer would be comes down to not only
luck but also the second-hand market in
your region where you look is also a
huge factor
an easy way out looking on eBay wasn't
very successful for me but you might
have more luck I found local trading
posts and computer forums to be by far
the best sources for cheap computer
parts and systems so make sure you look
around to try and find the best buying
options in your part of the world the
q90 300 was surprisingly capable though
the geforce gtx 560 TI had its ups and
downs delivered acceptable performance
in games such as overwash and League of
Legends while the sucks badly in
battlefront and rocket League I mean the
q90 300 with the RX 460 solved any
performance issues I was having a really
brought this system to life alternatives
to the $110 Radeon rx4 60 will be
something like the r7 260x or even HD 77
90 likely I've seen GTX 580 and HD 7970
cards selling for as little as $50 so
there are certainly some cheap options
out there of course if you can land an
even faster GPU then that's even better
just make sure you overclock the q90 300
processor on that note you'll ideally
require an aftermarket our style CPU
cooler if you want to push much past
three gigahertz on the overclock in the
end we've taken a good look at how the
Core 2 quad q 9300 handles some of
today's most popular games using an old
GPU along with the modern budget option
the idea of this video isn't to show you
how to purchase such a system for 30 US
dollars but rather inform you that it is
possible and this is the resulting
performance the hope is with a clear
indication of the expected performance
you can make a much more informed
purchase here in Australia we're paying
a little over $80 for the pentium g 40
400 processor alone so I feel paying up
to a hundred bucks for a Core 2 quad
system with a decent GPU is still very
much worth it unfortunately on eBay
prices seem to start around 120 dollars
for complete systems while those with
decent GPU started around 150 dollars it
took me a few weeks of bidding bartering
and begging before I found the right
system at the right price so if that's
something you aren't willing to do then
budget second-hand shopping probably
isn't the right option for you what do
