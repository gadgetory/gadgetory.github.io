once again today we will be looking at
risin 7 gaming performance as we've
already done but though we bit of a
twist this time we're going to see how
risin 7 compares when using Windows 7
already I've gathered results for about
16 games using Windows 10 so I thought
it'd be cool to see how those results
compared to Windows 7 or at least in the
games that use DirectX 11 anyway and the
reason I'm doing this is because after
that video quite a few of you did
suggest as I retest using Windows 7 as
there were users reporting considerably
better performance of gaming performance
on that operating system with the rise
in CPUs in that initial video I found
that in some games disabling SMT led to
rather large performance gains while in
some games that actually reduce
performance and others we saw little to
no difference
since then AMD has conducted their own
investigation to the impact SMT has on
gaming they concluded by saying that it
is in our experience that gaming
applications should generally see
neutral to positive benefits from SMT
they went on to say they have seen this
behavior in a wide range of games
including ARMA 3 battlefield 1 mafia 3
watchdogs to civilization 6 4 on a
hitman Mirror's Edge catalyst adds the
division they also state that
independent third parties have confirmed
these findings I assume a watch to my
video because all those games were
tested and that is word for word the
order in which I listed the games
wrapping that topic up they said for the
remaining out lies aimed against has
multiple opportunities within the code
bases of specific applications to
improve how the software addresses an
architecture we've already identified
some simple changes that can improve the
game's understanding of the Zen core / -
topology and we intend to provide a
status update to the community when they
are ready
another issue they addressed was thread
scheduling AMD said that they have
investigated reports alleging incorrect
thread scheduling on the horizon
processes in short AMD believes the
Windows 10 thread scheduler is operating
properly for them and they do not
believe there is presently a problem
with a thread schedule adversely
utilizing logical and physical
configurations of the architecture
they have reviewed the limited available
evidence concerning performance deltas
between Windows 7 and Windows 10 and do
not believe there is an issue with the
scheduling differences between the two
versions of Windows any differences in
performance can be more likely
attributed to software architecture
differences between the OSS so AMD says
that there isn't an issue which frankly
is disappointing as I was hoping to see
some decent performance improvements in
Windows 10 via an update anyway since I
have been testing performance in Windows
7 I thought I should share those results
with you anyway to help clear things up
I had plan to get this video out earlier
but the GeForce GTX 1082 I released
halted progress without wasting any more
time let's get to the benchmarks first
up I took a look at ARMA 3 and here the
1800 X did provide a slightly better
average framerate using the older
Windows 7 OS here we see a 4 percent
improvement in framerate though it is
worth noting that the minimum frame rate
remained at the same testing with
battlefield 1 we again see the Windows
server provides slightly better
performance that said this time a mere
two percent performance bump can be seen
so not exactly performance redefining
figures this time Windows 10 comes out
ahead when looking at the average frame
rate offering two percent more
performance that says the minimum frame
rate was identical on both operating
systems when testing with f1 2016 Fire
Cry primal is a game where rising really
struggles and we do see a 5 percent
improvement on Windows 7 for the average
frame rate that says the minimum was
increased by just a single frame which
is in the margin of error the firaon
results are much the same in both
operating systems as we see an average
of 172 fps each so not much else needs
to be said here really so let's move on
Grand Theft Auto 5 runs slightly better
on Windows 10 according to these FPS
numbers though once again the margins do
fall within the margin of error testing
with hitman we find the exact same
performance from the 1800 X on both
operating systems so again not much else
to really say here interestingly mafia 3
played better on Windows 10 here we see
6 percent more performance when
comparing the average framerate Mirror's
Edge catalyst played much the same on
Windows 7 as it did 10 so again nothing
really to see here overwatch played much
the same on both operating systems that
said we do see a 3 percent performance
advantage in favor of the newer
operating system finally watchdogs 2 and
here we see this title was slightly
faster you
Windows 10 here we see a four percent
performance bump well that wraps the
testing up not terribly exciting results
but I hope you guys have your answer now
unfortunately this video was a bit late
to the party yeah with AMD already
confirming that Windows 7 has nothing
extra add in the way of performance I
didn't exactly address a burning
question here still I was halfway
through testing when the gtx 980ti
rudely interrupted me and i wanted to
get back and finish what I've begun
sadly though Windows 7 hasn't really
shown us that there's anything extra to
be had or at least in comparison the
Windows 10 doesn't necessarily mean an
update to the Windows 10 scheduler
wouldn't improve performance we just
don't know at this point but anyway I do
remain confident that there is still
some gains to be had yet actually I hope
there is anyway that's all for this one
there will be more testing coming up
shortly on the channel so remain on
standby I'm your host Steve catch again
soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
