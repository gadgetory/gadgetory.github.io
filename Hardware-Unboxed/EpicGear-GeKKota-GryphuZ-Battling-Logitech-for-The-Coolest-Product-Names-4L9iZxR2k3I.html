unboxed today I've got unhand a gaming
mouse from brand I haven't had a chance
to look at before in the channel epicure
it's the division of the memory company
geo they called the gecko toy and it's a
cool-looking little ambidextrous mouse
on hand I've got the white model as you
can see but there's also an electric
blue colorway available to looking at
the shape and size of the mouse it's
definitely more suited to claw and
fingertip grip gamers with a fairly low
profile body narrow width in a smallish
rear end on either side there's a
rubberized grip for your thumb and pinky
no matter which hand used and these
sides are also indented creating a bit
of a rest this is something I miss when
I use my such as the marnix caster and
my thumb is left dragging on the
mousepad you'll also find two back and
forward style buttons on either side of
the mouse and of course the ones on the
same side as your thumb or a lot easier
to reach in total there's 11
programmable buttons on the mouse
including the standard left and right
the mouse wheel to buttons behind the
mouse wheel the back and forward buttons
on either side is mentioned and then
there's two more interesting buttons
that sit on the side at the very front
for me these sat out of reach on the
thumb side but my ring finger SAT right
near it on the opposite side this is a
finger I've never had a button for
before so it was interesting and took
some getting used to but I'm sure gamers
could find some pretty handy uses for it
the wheel itself feels great it's made
of plastic coated and rubber and lights
up on either side this actually felt
quite similar to the wheel and my my
next caster when scrolling but it
actually has less wobble it gives a
little thought as tactile feedback as
you scroll and was overall very
satisfying to use and looks great to the
left and right buttons are fine to use
very clicky but they also have a bit of
extra travel before activating the left
and right also made a slightly different
clicking noise and felt a little
different to each other I prefer the
responsiveness and steady feeling left
and rights on the caster the two buttons
behind the mouse wheel control the DPI
settings by default and there's a little
indicator that shows you what level
you're at 2 which is cool I think
there's a position well and it was easy
to tell which was which without looking
behind all this is a cool illuminated
Epicure logo as well as a smaller kokoda
logo down the bottom flipping the mouse
over the end
I Peter's a cool metal insert in the
center that lets us know it's a gaming
laser sensor speaking of which the
sensor utilizes the pic site a DNS 9800
capable of up to 80 200 DPI this felt
smooth and accurate and also works in a
variety of surfaces there's some nice
big Teflon pads at the underside to and
combined with the mouse is light weight
of a hundred grams it's very easy to
push around the mouse pad now speaking
of surfaces I've also got epicures
griffis mouse pad on hand to go on with
the mouse the top layer on the griffis
is a sort of shiny silky material enough
it's slightly less friction than the
steelseries desk mat that I was used to
there's nothing subtle about the design
either there's a huge Griffin claw
clutching the bright orange epic your
logo splashed in the middle so if you
like the design then you'll like the
mousepad I do prefer stitched edge mass
pads for durability is there's nothing
worse than the edge peeling away but it
does seem like a good quality pad
there's no signs of frayed edges at this
stage lastly I'm not really sure about
the finish on the kokoda it's pure white
and very glossy it looks great when it's
brand new but if this starts to wear
away over time it'll probably look like
rubbish it's hard to say at this stage
had durable it is hopefully very the
software looks exactly like one you get
from a memory company that's moved in
peripherals to the design is in line
with what you see on the mouse pad and
the mouse itself and it's a pretty
powerful suite you can adjust things
like the DPI levels liftoff distance
angle snapping macros and you can also
program the function of each button
interestingly I couldn't find anywhere
to buy the epic you gift coder in the
USA and it was unavailable on both
amazon and newegg in australia you can
pick it up for ninety five dollars from
my 492 dollars on ebay through ple this
puts it in the same class as my such as
monix caster and the logitech g502
proteus spectrum RGB which is actually
available for a little less at
eighty-nine dollars of course your
choice will come down to personal
preference and I always recommend
finding somewhere that you can try it
out before you buy I'm not sure the
kokoda can quite compete with the g502
in my opinion and call me strange but I
actually prefer the g4 or two out of all
of them what do you guys think have you
used the kokoda let me know in the
comments i'm your host Matt and i'll see
you guys next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
