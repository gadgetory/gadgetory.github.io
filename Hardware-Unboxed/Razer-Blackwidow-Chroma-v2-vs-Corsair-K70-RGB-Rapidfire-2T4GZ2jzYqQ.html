box today we have for you a 3-way
mechanical RGB keyboard battle now I've
been sent a couple of keyboards over the
past few weeks and I thought the best
way to take a look at these guys is to
do a battle to the death and two of
these keyboards are reasonably new so we
have the creative soundblaster
x value zero eight if you're watching
our unboxing series you would have seen
this guy come in the sound blaster
weapons create a couple of weeks ago
this is a reasonably new keyboard one of
the only ones you can get in the sound
blaster range we also have one of the
tried-and-true
really high quality keyboards from Razer
it is the BlackWidow chroma b2 really
excited to take a look at this one and I
just figured I'd throw into the
comparison here one of my favorite
keyboard makers Corsair this is a highly
rated keyboard one that on techspot at
least we've been recommending for quite
some time it is the k70 RGB rapid-fire
so three excellent quality RGB
mechanical keyboards here most of which
are designed for gaming and we're going
to be checking all of these guys out
throughout the rest of this video I'll
just quickly dive into the
specifications of each of these three
keyboards and we will start with the
Razer BlackWidow chroma v2 so this is a
170 dollar keyboard it comes with three
key switch variants the Razer green
orange and yellows at least in my review
'not these are Razer greens it has a 10
key roll over with a maximum polling
rate one millisecond and supports up to
80 million keystrokes on those Razer
green or any of the Razer key switches
the creative soundblaster X value zero
eight has on one press switches in it it
has a twenty six key roll over one
millisecond max polling rate 70 million
keystroke lifespan and this is the
cheapest of the keyboards here at one
hundred and forty dollars as a
standalone model and the corsair k70 RGB
rapid-fire uses Cherry MX speed RGB key
switches as full key roll over one
millisecond max
50 million keystroke lifespan and it
costs one hundred and seventy dollars at
the same price for the courser keyboard
as the razer keyboard as also worth
mentioning to the case 70 series if
you're not a fan of the RGB speed
switches from cherry you can purchase
this in a bunch of other switches
including Cherry MX Reds Browns and
blues so you don't necessarily have to
buy the rapid-fire but there are a bunch
of high-quality k70 models available
we'll start off by talking about the
design and there's a couple of things
they usually look for when I'm buying
keyboard and the first of those is of
course comfort I want a very comfortable
typing experience and I think this is
where the Razer BlackWidow chroma v2
really shines because it has an
extremely plush wrist rest this was an
issue with the first generation chroma
units is that they didn't actually come
with a wrist rest at all but they
brought that in for the version too and
it's so plush and so comfortable to use
for either typing or gaming that it
really blows the offerings from quarter
and created out of the water in that
regard these both the Razer and the
creative keyboards are mostly made of
plastic around the body of the keyboard
itself the creative keyboard probably
has the best soft touch keycaps of all
three of these keyboards although it's a
pretty tight battle between each of them
although the general build quality of
the Corsair keyboard is probably the
best considering it uses metal around
the base of the keyboard and has quite a
nice soft touch plastic wrist rest
they're not as good as the Razer
offering it's still very good
nonetheless as far as the creative
keyboard goes feels a little bit cheap
in terms of that matte plastic that you
use or see here for that wrist rest so
not a huge fan of the creative design
but I think that the course and razor
ones really hit it out of the park
of course the Corsair design is somewhat
different because the keys sit above the
metal back and that gives it a different
sort of look to the keyboard whereas
both the Razer and creative options have
the keys inset the insert option
actually gives a better RGB effect both
of these keyboards use a white backing
that reflects light around the keys and
I think that gives it makes it a bit
more brighter and vibrant for that RGB
effect whereas the Corsair keyboard
mostly relies on the
light coming through the keycaps and
also you see some glow and reflections
around the edges but it's not as
prominent as on the eraser or the
creative options of course there's a
number of features to talk about with
each of these three keyboards as well
and surprisingly the vanguard k08 has
the best physical feature set of the
three keyboards this is the only
keyboard here that has both dedicated
media controls which i think is hugely
important in a keyboard as well as
dedicated macro keys and a USB
pass-through so all three of these
features you will find on the creative
offering moving over to the Corsair
offering this does have media keys as
well as quite a nice volume control it
also has a USB pass-through but it
doesn't have those dedicated macro keys
which is a bit of a disappointment here
considering that this is a feature only
found in courses more expensive k95
keyboards you can get this feature in
both the razor and the vanguard
keyboards but you will have to pay more
if you want it on the Corsair so as far
as the Razer keyboard is concerned the
BlackWidow chroma v2 like I said you do
get a dedicated macro keys but there are
no dedicated media keys now for me at
least I tend to use media keys more than
macro keys so the omission on the black
widow seems to be something that isn't
pleasing me too much but at least you do
get media functionality integrated
through some additional functions maps
to the F keys on that keyboard not as
quick to access but it is still included
and as far as the macro keys on the
Corsair keyboard is concerned you can
actually set up macros for every single
one of the keys on this keyboard you can
do things like swap key functions launch
applications and all of that but you
will just have to map those macros to
existing keys something like maybe page
up or page down scroll lock something
like that you can map your macros to
which on the other two keyboards you can
map those to five dedicated macro keys
so just a bit of a difference depending
on what you want there moving on to the
area that I think you guys would be most
interested in and that is the typing
experience this is an interesting
comparison because each of these three
keyboards includes different key caps
we'll start off with the Vanguard k08
because these use Omron pres key
switches which I think are the weakest
of the three they have a one
five milliliter actuation distance and
require 45 grams of four so they're
designed mostly for gaming but they do
have a tactile bump to them if you look
at the information that creative
provides but I don't think that these
give a particularly nice tactile
feedback this has been an issue for
Omron switches for quite some time
it ain't that a bit of a mushy response
when you depress them the entire way
which the other two keyboards don't give
you this makes it closer to a rubber
dome keyboard it still has a little bit
of a mechanical feel but I just feel
that that machinist that you get when
typing isn't as good as you'll find on
either the Razer or the Cherry MX key
switches and I can't really recommend
this keyboard from the perspective of
those key switches although it is a
cheaper keyboard so if this did have a
cherry MX key switches you would expect
to pay more money but I just I can't get
behind the tactile feedback of the omron
switch is too much here moving on to the
Razer BlackWidow chroma v2 and in my
review Nitai was equipped with Razer
green key switches a 1.9 millimetre
actuation distance and 50 grams of force
these key switches are mostly designed
for typing to have a distinct clicky
feel and they're very loud they're
equivalent to Cherry MX blue key
switches so extremely quick quickie
extremely loud and they're not too
suited for gaming thanks to their
extended travel distance and that clicky
feel but for typing these key switches
provide the best experience of all of
these keyboards I love typing on the
Razer green switches on the BlackWidow
chroma v2 if you are more inclined to
other types of key switches there are
two other options Razer orange key
switches which are a sort of a more
silent version of the greens they're
equivalent to Cherry MX brown so if you
love the browns get this keyboard with
Razer orange key switches they're also
the brand new Razer yellow key switches
these are very fast one point two
millimeter actuation distance and 45
grams of force they are equivalent to
the Cherry MX speed switches that we'll
be talking a little bit in the k7e
rapid-fire so if you are more inclined
to do gaming on your keyboard you're not
interested in a clicky response it's
linear with the Razer yellows you should
definitely opt for that in the
by cuido chroma v2 so there's a bunch of
options there I really like the greens
but I think if I was purchasing this
keyboard myself I'd probably opt for the
oranges because I love the Cherry MX
browns
as for the Corsair k70 RGB rapid-fire
Cherry MX speed RGB switch is here so 45
grams of actuation force and a one point
two millimeter actuation distance
they're a very responsive key switch
thanks to their linear response their
short travel distance so they're perfect
for gaming very responses that bounce
back quickly they're great for
repetitive keystrokes and that's exactly
what you'd want for a gaming situation I
think they're a bit too heavy for
general keyboard or tightening use the
travel distance isn't as long as I would
like if I was typing up extended
documents but again you can buy the K 70
and a bunch of other key switches
including Cherry MX blues Browns and
reds so you can get this keyboard in
whatever key switch you like but I think
the rapid fires are definitely designed
for the best gaming experience and the
responsiveness of this case which is
fantastic for that particular use case
of course it wouldn't be an RGB keyboard
battle without talking about some of the
RGB functionality that you'll find in
each of these three keyboards it's
actually pretty similar across the board
and what you can find in the software
utility is provided by each of these
companies all of them have preset RGB
sort of patterns that you can set up and
use you'll get the standard waves and
ripples and a couple of other cool
effects on some of the Corsair and razer
keyboards that you might like playing
around with so for those who don't want
to customize the exact keys and exact
colors for each of those keys
each of these keyboards provides you
with some fantastic presets out of the
box so those that do want to customize I
don't think creative software utility is
quite to the standard of the core set or
razor utility at this stage it does
allow you to customize each of the
individual keys so if for example you
want to eliminate just the keys that are
used in your game you can definitely do
that on their creative keyboard as with
the other keyboards but it doesn't have
some of the functionality such as it's a
bit harder to create the ripple effects
or the wave effects to your exact
working on the creative keyboard whereas
in the corset and raise the utility is
there or
for you a ton of options that allow you
to do all sorts of effects with your
keyboard and create awesome effects the
courser utility is probably a little bit
easier to use than the razor utility in
general for setting up things like
customized lighting for each of the keys
but the razor utility does provide
slightly more options in terms of the
RGB functionality that you get they also
have a thing called chroma apps on the
razor utility that can override your
color options with supported
applications for cool effects and
integration with apps but the app
support list isn't too great at the
moment and it's not really what I'd say
is a standout feature at the moment but
I guess you know in the next couple
years we might see some more application
support for the Razer chroma apps if I
had to recommend one of these keyboards
I think it's unfortunately easy to
discount the creative soundblaster x
value 8 its build quality isn't quite as
nice as the other two keyboards it's
online key switches I think give too
much of a mushy you feel and it's
software utility isn't as mature as what
you'll find for me the Corsair or razor
is the cheaper keyboard in the United
States at a hundred and forty dollars
compared to 174 the other two options
but I still think it's worth spending
the extra money on either the corset or
razor options in any case if you are
spending over a hundred dollars on a
mechanical RGB keyboard it's actually a
mid tier keyboard in terms of pricing in
Australia this keyboard will set you
back 230 Australian dollars at the
moment but the Corsair k70 RGB
rapid-fire is cheaper just 190 dollars I
think those of you in Australia that's a
really good deal for this keyboard
because the Razer BlackWidow chroma v2
retails for two hundred and sixty
dollars seventy dollars more for the
razor option I think is a bit too much
to pay so for those of you in Australia
the Corsair k70 RGB rapid-fire or any of
the k70 RGB ranges a fantastic option at
that price those of you in other nations
though where these two keyboards the K
70 and the Black Widow are priced more
similarly as you'll find the United
States with their 170 dollar price it's
actually a really close battle
I reckon that
the comfort of the Razer BlackWidow is
superior to the comfort provided by the
k70 thanks that extremely plush leather
ish foam wrist rest it's awesome on the
Razer BlackWidow it's also is probably a
slightly better RGB effective that makes
a big difference for you but the two
software utilities between each of these
keyboards is very similar the key switch
options again very similar but of course
you can choose different key switches
for each of these keyboards Razer green
orange or yellows are available in the
Black Widow and Cherry MX speed brown
blue and Red's are available for the k70
RGB series so I know the battle is
really close and I think you can't go
wrong with either the k7 or the Black
Widow but if I had to make a choice just
to end this battle once and for all as
my personal preference I probably go
through the superior comfort provided by
the Razer BlackWidow chroma v2 although
I do appreciate the media control softly
Corsair k70 so it's a really tough
battle and again I don't think you can
go wrong with either of those two
options anyway that's it for this
mechanical keyboard 3-way RGB battle
don't forget there is a written version

we'll catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
