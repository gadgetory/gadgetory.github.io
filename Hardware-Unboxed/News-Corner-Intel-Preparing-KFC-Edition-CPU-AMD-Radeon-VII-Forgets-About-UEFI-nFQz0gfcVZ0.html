corner coming at you today on Sunday
rather than our usual Friday slot it's
been quite busy around here for us both
Steve and I spending quite a bit of time
looking at the latest game releases so
stay tuned for that on the channel soon
I guess it's great for games that we're
getting a whole ton of races at once but
does kind of make a little difficult for
us to do all the testing that we want to
do for you guys so bear with us as we
work on that one over the next few weeks
but before then let's talk about some
news and hopefully the Australian bird
noises outside aren't gonna be too bad
for you guys this time around the first
topic I want to talk to you about is Vox
media issuing a false takedown notice to
bit wit Kyle over his reaction video a
parody of the Verge's terrible PC
building video I'm sure many of you have
seen this issue blow up over the last
week many craters have already made
videos in support of Kyle made you know
excellence download videos on the matter
so I'm not going to spend a whole lot of
time on this particular issue here but
basically as creators ourselves it's
very important to us to stand up to
blatant abuses of the YouTube copyright
system like this the tools are there for
a reason there are legitimate situations
where filing a takedown request is
necessary we've had to do it when others
have reupload and stolen our content but
if organizations are allowed to get away
with abusing these tools it sets a nasty
precedent where someone can have a video
removed for illegitimate reasons such as
censorship of criticism so it's great to
see the community rallying to say loudly
that the actions of Vox media pretty
much unacceptable and we certainly want
to add our voice to that I don't think
the Verge's response to the takedown
issue is acceptable either it's very
disappointing at least in my eyes that a
major news organization would act in
this way in general yes so that's
basically our thoughts on the issue we
try and stay out of the major drama
things like this as much as possible
because we love to just focus on the
tech the content the regular stuff that
you guys see on the channel but for
issues like this that can affect us and
our livelihood as creators as well as
the livelihood of everyone else in the
community I think it's important to
speak up on those sort of things so ok
into the real news now AMD has shipped
the Radeon 7 with that UEFI his support
and
story is pretty hard to believe when I
first read it but apparently an
oversight during the cards development
met this feature was left out of final
shipping models when a GPU doesn't
support UEFI several issues crop up your
motherboard will have to enable the
compatibility support module which can
slow down boot times and cause other
issues it also means the UEFI secure
boot will be disabled and Aztec powerup
points up if a product breaks secure
boot functionality it would fail Windows
10 logo certification with that said in
most cases a card that doesn't support
your EFI should still work and function
normally for gaming and so on without
any performance difference AMD is aware
of the problem and it has raised a new
bias revision for the radial seven that
adds in UEFI support along with the
required bare-bones GOP driver this BIOS
revision will be available through AIB
partners such as asrock who have already
published an update as well as through
AMD comm with a one-click install so it
should be a pretty straightforward
problem to solve
it's very strange this sort of issue
would slip through the cracks name is QA
division though although the launch has
been a bit unusual Steve encountered a
larger than normal selection of bugs
with the pre-release drivers many of
which have since been fixed but that
problem combined with the UEFI problem
could point to a bit of a rush to
release here in better news for the
Radeon 7md has released a new rally on
Pro driver that adds limited support for
consumer GPUs including the Radeon seven
users who install the Radeon Pro
software for enterprise drivers for
regular Radeon cards won't get all the
features that are enabled with Radeon
Pro cards like workstation app
optimizations and certifications and
remote workstation support but the
driver will bring commercial software
support and performance as well as
enterprise security features so that's
pretty nice if you want to install you
know that for your workstation use on a
consumer cart there might be a lot
cheaper
rather than using this you know standard
gaming set of drivers
thanks to video cards we're getting the
first look at invidious tu1 1/6 GPU the
heart of invidious upcoming geforce gtx
1660 TI graphics card video cards
apparently has received photos of an MSI
Ventus model which when torn down has
revealed a tu1 1/6 GPU as expected
rather than at a 106 GPU with sections
to say
the T 106 being the GP used with the RT
X 2016 the TU one one six diet soap is
physically smaller than tu 106 which is
from the rumoured lack of RT intensive
chords in this GPU and invidious new gtx
cards in general nothing much else to
say he really are gonna guess it's
interesting to see the dive photographed
at this stage the GPU is expected to be
released on February 22 with a non ti
model coming at a later date and we
should have more to share on this
particular GPU soon it's looking like
Intel will release a special KFC edition
of The Crow 999 hundred K named after of
course one of the world's largest fried
chicken stores and well as a world first
collaboration between Intel and a fast
food restaurant for a high-end
enthusiast desktop processor the cry 9
9900 KFC is said to be enhanced with
chicken fat thermal interface material
and come with a special edition 11
secret herbs and spices box cooler KFC
will be selling the CPU at all of its
twenty thousand-plus locations worldwide
in a bundle with classic original recipe
chicken although we're not quite sure on
official launch pricing yet
so I really wish what I just said was
the case but unfortunately the real
story is a lot more boring in actual
fact the cryin nine 9900 KFC was simply
mentioned in the change notes for a
recent Ida 64 beta update usually either
gets updated to support new CPUs well
before launch and in this case a KFC
model processor has been mentioned ahead
of an Intel official announcement
there's no word on what the 9900 KFC
actually is we know the K suffix stands
for unlocked and Intel recently also
added an F for models without an AI GPU
so they already announced Conine 9900 KF
is in 99 100 K just with that integrated
graphics we're not sure what the C
stands for though so we'll have to wait
until the models come out to see how it
differs from the other already released
SKUs it could mean there is a drm
involved like with Broadwell c miles but
we just don't know at this stage msi is
set to release a Radeon rx 580 2048 SP
one of the most misleading products
released by OMB in the last few years
we've talked a little bit about this GPU
before but basically is just a factory
overclocked rx 570 labeled as NOx 5av so
that buyers get confused and might
accidentally buy the wrong product while
spending more money than necessary in
the process it's unclear where MSI will
be selling this product but it's likely
this will be reserved exclusively for
Asian markets however as we said in our
initial discussion on the rx 580 2048 SP
really doesn't matter where this GPU is
sold is still a misleading product that
should be sold under a different name
something that's more accurate or AMD
could just continue to sell our x5 7 is
without needing to create another rx 570
and then call that anarch's 580 so I
found this next story pretty funny to be
honest continuing the whole Metro Exodus
epic game store saga buyers of the
physical PC version have noticed that a
simple sticker is covering up the Steam
logo on the back of the packaging the
stick is an overlay for the system
requirements but it also seems to change
the steamer go and disclaimer to one
relevant to the epic Store so seems
pretty clear now that as many people
have guessed the whole deal to remove
Metro exodus from steam was a
last-minute decision there's also
impacted even their physical
manufacturing final topic for the week
the latest preview version of the
real engine has added preliminary
support for microsoft's directx ray
tracing or DXi api this could make it
easy for developers to add in ray
tracing support to games which is good
news for those who bought our Tex GPU
new craving a bit more ray tracing
action considering there's such a
limited selection of games either with
ray tracing right now or confirmed to
support ray tracing in the future any
update like this is welcome for that
ecosystem alright that's it for today's

necessarily a bad thing as always you
