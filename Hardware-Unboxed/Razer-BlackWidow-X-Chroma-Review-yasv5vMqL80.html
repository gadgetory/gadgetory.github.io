Boston today I've got another razor
gaming keyboard review for you this time
I'm taking a look at the black widow x
chroma i looked at the black widow x
Ultimate Edition a few weeks ago and I
was very impressed overall so I've been
keen to get my hands on another one
since at first inspection the X
chromosomes kind of minimal go on to the
macro Keys of old and the layouts very
standard a function button activates
secondary functions along the F kero
allowing you to mainly control media as
well as change the brightness of the
LEDs activate gaming mode and record
macro is on the fly at the top right
hand side some very minimal looking
indicators let you know if you have caps
lock on etc as well as indicate macro
recording and the status of your gaming
mode function these are labeled but it's
black on black and frankly very hard to
see unless you're on the right angle it
doesn't take long to learn which is
which the macro recording one lights up
red but I think this could have been
labeled in a way that was a little
easier to understand the body of the
keyboard is constructed from a very
sturdy military-grade metal which means
it isn't a light keyboard but the body
is very strong and looks great too the
face is a matte black that's actually
very fingerprint resistant which is a
definite place and goes a long way the
stylish appearance of the device
something else I noticed straight away
it was how bright the LEDs look razor
has used the simple LED above the switch
design rather than embedding the LED in
the switch and inside of the key caps is
white which reflects the IG bees back
onto the black backing player for a
seriously bright glow I thought this
made for a pretty cool effect and those
that really like bright and noticeable
leds will enjoy this aspect of the
keyboard lighting kind of course be
customized your heart's content and
Razer synapse software which is a
well-polished sweet profiles can be
easily created and customized saving any
lighting on macro setups you've designed
and you can also tweak a few other
settings such as which key combinations
disabled in gaming mood for instance
razors chrome apps can be switched on
and off and you can also allow razor to
gather stats for you based on how you
use the keyboard on the underside of the
keyboard there are two hind legs that
prop it up on an angle as per usual and
rays are also included some routes view
management of the braided cable this can
go right left or straight out the back
it's a nice touch for those that are
particular about where their cables have
their desk personally I found this
keyboard to be a dream I really grown to
like these green razor switches in
particular there's a very strong tactile
feel to them and they make a loud sound
that I find extremely satisfying here's
a little typing test for you to enjoy
and listen to I think the only things
missing from the Black Widow excrement
made it pretty much perfect our USB
passthrough and the option for a wrist
rest having tested so many boys the
don't feature wrist rests I'm kind of
getting used to it but I do definitely
prefer having one or at least the option
overall the Black Widow X chromosome
kanika keyboard it's minimal design is
very sleek and attractive and the RGB
LED implementation is one of the
brightest and most striking Arsene i
personally find raises switches to be a
delight to use and if you like a loud
and strong tactile switch then I think
you will too in the USA the black widow
x chrome app isn't exactly cheap coming
in one hundred and sixty dollars and I
would like to see those extra features
included for that sort of price it seems
like you're paying a pretty low
Australia tax this time around and you
can pick up the extra chromophore one
hundred and eighty dollars from my let
me know what you think of the extra more
in the comments i'm your host man as
always and i'll see you guys next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
