we're looking at a brand new monitor
from Philips a bit of a follow-on from
my review of their 43 inch beast on the
channel a few weeks ago but I don't like
that display which is I guess it's
impractical for most users the 32 inch
model I'm reviewing today makes a bit
more sense for the average gamer this
model is so new that for now in what is
I guess a rare feat it seems to only be
selling in Australia though I suspect
Philips will push it out to more regions
shortly in any case the monitor is the
three to eight m6 fjr MB which is an
absolutely atrocious name for a product
it's especially terrible because there
is only a one letter difference between
this monitor and another monitor from
Philips see that are in the product name
the third last letter yeah that's what
separates this monitor from an older
version released back in 2017 that's
pretty crazy right the art basically
means this new monitor is HDR capable
with display HDR 400 certification I'll
talk a little bit about that in a mode
because the term HDI appears to have
been used loosely but the key problem is
the ridiculous product name that makes
it nearly impossible for buyers to
distinguish the fjr MB model from the
older fjm be Souza verbs this is a
terrible product name please
fix it anyway so this is a 32-inch 1808
curve to 2560 by 1440 monitor with the
maximum 144 hertz refresh rate with
freesync support for the monitor nerds
out there it uses a samsung VA panel
with a tpv backlight unit which is the
exact same unit used in the AOC a g3 22
qcx I believe this panel is also used in
several other popular monitors with
similar specs like the vo-tech GM 32 LD
are reviewed on the channel previously
owned with the new Samsung JG 50 in
terms of pricing this Philips model is
the most expensive out of that bunch at
$600 ozzie which makes it $20 more than
the AOC model and $40 more than the new
Samsung model the JG 50 is actually a
great price in the US right now just 300
two US dollars while the aoc model is
almost $100 more and it's pretty
interesting to compare the two regions
right now in terms of pricing and I
suspect this firts unit will slide in
around $400 u.s. if it makes it to the
states this particular panel has had a
long life and has been progressively
getting cheaper which is why I suspect
we continue to see new product launches
including this Phillips unit and the new
Samsung JG 50 the AG 322 QC x launched
for around four hundred and thirty
dollars back in 2017 and before that we
had the popular Samsung chg 70 with a
display HDR 600 capable backlight at a
higher $600 price however as you might
notice the AG 322 QC X is not an HDR
display yet this Philips monitor is and
both use the exact same display unit
that's rather suspicious if you ask me
there's a bit of a precursor to our HDR
performance evaluation anyway first
let's look at the designer it's a pretty
decent one from films with slim bezels
around three sides of the display and a
simple black plastic construction on the
rear though there are some large glossy
sections that might annoy some of you
the stand is a reasonably attractive
v-shaped metal design which is sturdy
and supports both tilt and height
adjustment though there's no swiveling
and understandably you can't pivot this
curved display into a portrait
orientation the on-screen display is
controlled through a directional toggle
and it includes well basically the same
features as the momentum 43 like it's
larger 43 inch brother
you still get amber glow lighting along
the bottom edge which is an RGB strip
that mimics whatever content is company
on the screen for a pleasant ambient
lighting effect that's best suited to
dark rooms with white walls and
furniture it works quite well if you're
into that sort of thing though it does
come disabled by default for inputs we
have two DisplayPort 1.2 ports an HDMI
1.4 and an HDMI 2.0 port along with VGA
some people will complain about the 1800
hour curvature to this display it is now
possible to get a flat variant with
these specs in monitors from LG and
picks yota that might be more at the Le
of the curve display haters but some
people like the curve it's a personal
preference thing and for me I could go
either way at 32 inches one thing that
irritates me about this display is that
it's
advertised as HDR capable and even comes
with display hgr 400 certification I
really don't like using this word if I
don't have to but in my eyes this
certification is a lie from what I
observed in testing not only does this
display fail to deliver a true HDR
experience it also fails some of the key
metrics that are required for display
HDR 400 certification which leaves me
questioning how Philips even managed to
get it certified by Visa I have
mentioned it in the past how I think
display HR 400 is far too loose of
respect for HDR content as well as you
can see from my HDR monitor checklist in
theory this display only passes a
handful of items namely sustained
brightness and 10-bit processing none of
the three key HDR pillars which are
color space brightness and contrast are
properly addressed in particular the
complete lack of local dimming means we
aren't getting anywhere near an
appropriate contrast ratio for HDR
content even though this is a VA display
however Philips specs for this monitor
are not accurate whatsoever while
Philips is claiming a 400 nits peak
brightness level I only achieved 214
it's at best whether I was in the SDR or
HDR modes so not only is the peak
brightness level unsuitable for HDR but
so is the sustained brightness level so
I'll have to add another cross to my HDR
checklist brightness accuracy is also
quite poor it seems the panel has been
calibrated thinking it can do 400 nits
because when you request 320 nits of
brightness it doesn't even run at its
full 214 it capability with that said I
can add a tick to the checklist because
the monitor supports 92% ease through
our p3 coverage which is a little higher
than 120% srgb anything above 90% DCI p3
is suitable for HDR and I suspect
Philips was being a bit conservative
with their color space figures in their
spec sheet so you are at least getting
one pillar to HDR and that's wider than
SDR color space but it still completely
fails on brightness and contrast so this
monitor simply is not HDR compliant it
cannot properly display HDR content so
it shouldn't be advertised as HDR
compatible this is especially bad as
Ferb's has specifically produced this
new model with HDR support in mind
to replace an older similar model that
does not have the feature I also think
Philip should not advertise the monitor
as display HDR 400 compliant not just
because the monitor can't display HDR
and buyers might you know get confused
into thinking display HDR 400 means
decent HDR I guess that's a completely
separate issue with the display HDR
tears but it's actually because it fails
the display HD have 400 performance
metrics see the white luminance
performance target that's required for
the 400 T well the momentum 32 can't hit
any of these brightness targets so it
isn't compliant with the spec now maybe
I just received a bad monitor and some
units actually can produce 116 it's more
brightness than my model can to meet the
spec let's be honest Philips if only
some monitors uShip can hit the
specifications listed on your box are
those specs really accurate to begin
with let's move on from HCI testing for
now because there's still hope that the
momentum 32 is a decent panel for
regular SDR content after all it's
mostly competing with SDR panels so it
can deliver a good experience here it
might still be worthy of a
recommendation in terms of response
times we're looking at a typical VI
panel here Philips lists a 5 millisecond
greater grade transition time though in
my testing actual figure is more like
8.0 5 milliseconds on average this is
using the faster overdrive setting the
second-fastest Philips provides with the
top setting introducing overshoot a
suspect Philips 5 millisecond metric
comes from either the minimum transition
time which is actually closer to 4
milliseconds or perhaps they used the
fastest overdrive mode in any case 8
milliseconds is more around the mark if
you look at the charts you'll see the
momentum 32 performs almost exactly on
par with the vo-tech tree and 32 LD I
monitor with similar specs and
presumably the same Samsung VI panel
while the overdrive algorithms are
different for each monitor of course the
average overall average rise and average
fall times for the Philips and via check
models are less than one millisecond
apart so it's always nice to see two
monitors you expect to perform the same
perform roughly the same in practice
however while 8 millisecond response
times are typical for a VI panel it's on
the slower end of the scale and this is
an inherent limitation of VA technology
while you do get great black levels the
penalty is slow to respond unfortunately
it means this display is not X
144 Hertz monitor 144 Hertz monitors
have a refresh window of 6.9 4
milliseconds but the Philips momentum 32
transitions on average in 8.05
milliseconds so we're effectively being
bottlenecked by pixel response to around
120 Hertz
in other words smearing ghosting and
overall clarity from this 144 Hertz VA
will be similar to other 120 Hertz
displays the good news is input lag is
fantastic the momentum 32 is one of the
fastest displays I reviewed with lag in
the 3 millisecond range this is in stark
contrast to the much slower momentum 43
I guess the momentum 32 being more of a
gaming focused product means they've
used a gaming grade scale and the
results definitely show however it all
falls apart a bit for Philips when
looking at color performance out of the
box this monitor is wildly inaccurate
white balance is absolutely crazy at 53
47 K and there is a strong red tint to
white which is immediately noticeable
and will annoy anyone who purchases this
monitor on top of that color gamut is
completely uncapped so when viewing
standard srgb imagery which forms
basically everything on your PC you'll
be getting severe over saturation and
this explains why Delta II averages
across the board are so bad on top of
this we're still facing week brightness
of around 240 nits and surprisingly low
contrast for a VA panel of just 2100 to
1 or there abouts this is similar to the
vo-tech G + 32 LD + AO CAG 322 QC X so
again we're looking at the same panel
that said IOC correctly lists a 2,000 to
1 contrast ratio in their spec sheet
while Philips lists 3000 to 1 which is
well above what it can actually achieve
fixing the color performance issues is
difficult
Philips does provide an sRGB mode which
clamps the display to srgb but it's
attempt at fixing the white balance
isn't much better than the default mode
and in the srgb mode you will locked out
of the user white balance controls
alternatively you can correct the white
balance yourself but then gambit remains
unclamped so everything is oversaturate
this really isn't a great place to be in
unless you have a hardware coloration
tool which I guess only a very small
minority of buyers will have access to
naturally of course it is possible to
get niak
performance with their software ICC
profile generated with spectra Cal's Cal
man 5 though there's still a bit of
wonkiness I guess to grayscale
performance a combination of OSD tweaks
and this profile does deliver proper srg
back your performance though and I guess
the one benefit to a wide gamut monitor
like this is if you have a calibration
tool you could create a profile for DCI
p3 or Adobe RGB though these are
software side profiles and won't be
supported in every application if your
momentum 32 is strongly tinted red like
mine was and you want srgb accuracy I
recommend trying the display profile we
created for this monitor you can get
access to that when you sign up to a
patreon page links in the description
final piece of the performance puzzle is
uniformity and here we have typical
results for a curve display the center
section of the display is reasonably
accurate but the outer edges are not
great like most panels with an 1800 our
curve of this size so it seems pretty
clear that philips has attempted to
create a more premium 32 inch 1440p 144
Hertz product with the momentum 32
because it's priced higher than similar
competing monitors like the AOC AG 322
QC X and the Samsung JG 50 the feature
that was supposed to differentiate this
monitor and justify the higher price tag
is HDR with display hgr 400 compliance
but this display actually delivers a
poor HDR experience and isn't even
display HDR 400 compliance as evidenced
by our standard monitor tests when you
factor in the issues with default color
performance namely the seeming lack of
any calibration at the factory and I
really don't see any reason to purchase
this display over the aoc or Samsung
options
the Samsung JG 50 is at a particularly
awesome price right now at either 360 US
dollars or 560 RZ so my recommendation
would tentatively go to that monitor
though I do hope to review it in the
next few months that's not to say every
aspect of the monitor is bad input lag
is fantastic those with hardware
calibration tools have the option of
creating a wide gamut profile
considering you are getting nearly full
Adobe RGB coverage and the design is
pretty great plus I still think 1440p
144 Hertz is the optimal setup for
monitor spec
for gamers but the value proposition
just isn't there right now and I really
don't like firms lying about hgr support
that's it for this review I suspect I
might be getting an email from Phillips
after this review goes up and I wonder
if they'll send out any more monitors to
review so in case they blacklist me
consider supporting us on patreon so we
can just buy their monitors ourselves in
the future subscribe for more monitor
reviews give this a like if you liked it
and I'll catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
