finally over I've done this shirt I hope
you're happy coz you've won this time
welcome back to hard one-box we get
asked a lot about gaming monitor
recommendations especially after I
started doing more regular monitor
reviews on the channel well today I'll
be providing you guys with five monitor
recommendations across a variety of
popular categories before I get into our
picks I'm going to talk briefly about
how I selected these monitors and what
qualifies for a recommendation firstly
in most categories we're looking for the
best gaming monitor not the cheapest so
basically that means the best monitor
specs performance and other features as
a result these recommendations are
mostly for high-end monitors which
naturally aren't always the cheapest but
we do love products that are the best
value for money so when two or more
monitors under consideration are roughly
equal in hardware and experience I went
with the cheapest option a big factor in
monitor prices these days is g-sync
versus free sync with g-sync monitors
universally costing around $200 more for
otherwise the same hardware the primary
focus of this video is on g-sync
monitors as according to the latest
steam hardware survey Nvidia has roughly
10 times the GPU market share among
gamers as AMD and if you're an Nvidia
user you will want a g-sync monitor to
gain access to adaptive sync but if you
are an AMD GPU owner and you are more
interested in free sync models I will be
providing free sync alternatives for
each part the other thing is we aren't
recommending monitors from ultra cheap
companies like biotech moderate price or
pick CEO because we haven't personally
put any of their products to the test we
don't want to recommend stuff in
companies until we've had experience
with their products to ensure we're not
telling you to buy something dodgy so
with that out of the way let's get on to
the picks
to kick things off we're looking at the
best 1080p gaming monitor
personally I prefer 27 inch monitors
over 24 inch which are the two most
popular sizes at this resolution and 27
inches pretty much the maximum size
you'd want to use with this sort of
resolution it's for this reason we're
recommending the ASA predator xB 2 7 to
a 27 inch 1080p TN monitor with a
maximum refresh of 240 Hertz and support
for g-sync this is actually the only
monitor on the market right now as far
as we know with these specifications and
gsync support this makes it a winner by
default of sorts though it's still a
decent option we went with a 240 Hertz
monitor over a cheaper 144 Hertz option
purely for the extra smoothness during
gameplay which is especially handy if
you're playing fast-paced eSport
shooters as you upgrade your hardware
over time the additional refresh rate
will also allow this monitor to stay
relevant for longer for those of you who
want a freesync alternative look out for
the new ASIC cagey 271 B or the older XF
- 7 th a which are basically the same
monitor without the GC module
when looking for the best 1440p gaming
monitors there are a class of displays
that stand out from the pack these
monitors all use the same 27-inch a hv8
IPS type panel with a 165 Hertz maximum
refresh rate which delivers great color
performance to go along with excellent
responsiveness these displays are the
best for gaming in the entire market
right now offering a great combination
of resolution and refresh rate our
favorite option of the bunch is the
g-sync capable viewsonic XG 2703 GS but
it's a little hard to find right now in
some markets though it is readily
available in Australia if you can't get
this monitor opt for the ace of Predator
X B 271 hu which shouldn't be confused
for the 271 hua or the 271 H a or even
the 270 hu
yeah it's a confusing product line over
at Asus so make sure you're getting the
xB 271 hu to avoid either a TN panel or
a 144 Hertz refresh rate we like the XG
to 7:03 - 3 s for its superior build
quality and view Sonic's better quality
assurance as reported by owners of these
monitors and we think that justifies the
slightly higher price tag compared to
the Acer option but if you're in North
America where the XG 2 7:03 is scarce
grab the xB 271 HU as the next best
option it's similar to the asou space
even 9q but at a lower price point
unfortunately for freesync owners there
are no 165 Hertz 1440p monitors
available so the next best option is a
144 Hertz 1440p panel here we recommend
the seuss mg279q that offers these specs
along with the similar a hva panel for a
great price
unfortunately the highly-anticipated 144
hertz 4k monitors with HDR support have
not hit the market just yet so the
gaming options at 4k are still limited
to just 60 Hertz the good news is that a
4k gaming monitor isn't that expensive
these days and will end up costing you
less than either the 1080p or 1440p
options we've recommended so far a pic
here is the aoc Aegon AG 271 ug as it's
the cheapest model on the market to
offer g-sync
a 4k resolution at 27 inches and an IPS
panel there are some other options
around they give you a TN panel instead
but IPS is better for viewing angles and
color reproduction and the lower
response times aren't a huge issue at 60
Hertz ideally we'd like to recommend a
32 inch 4k monitor instead of a 27 each
option for the extra screen real estate
but the one g-sync option on the market
the ASA probe over xB 321 HK seems to be
on the way out and cost an unreasonable
$350 more than the AOC monitor we've
decided on four freesync owners we like
the look of the LG 27 UD 68 - W as it
again provides a 27 inch IPS type panel
instead of TN like many freesync 4k
monitors it is more expensive than the
27 UD 58 - b but the extra money goes
towards a newer superior panel and much
slimmer bezels
if you're not thinking of grabbing a
1440p high refresh monitor a high-end
ultra-wide should be in consideration
like with the 4k monitors new HDR
capable ultra wise with a 34 40 by 1440
resolution and a 200 Hertz refresh rate
have been announced but they aren't yet
available so our recommendations at this
stage are four monitors you can I guess
actually purchase the top ultra high
panels right now either 34 or 35 inches
in size with a 34 40 by 1440 resolution
and a 100 Hertz refresh rate or higher
while not the absolute best panel
available the value of the AOC
a g35 to you CG is hard to ignore it
comes with a 35 inch VA panel 34 40 by
14 resolution a 100 Hertz maximum
refresh and gsync support all for just
seven hundred and seventy dollars right
now
that's almost free sync level pricing
for a g-sync modern up making it an
absolute steal for NVIDIA GPU owners
plus the VA panel used in this display
is quite good and features an 1800 R
curve that works well for gaming with
such a large wide monitor the absolute
best ultra wide display is the Dell
Alienware aw three four-one HD w you had
quite a product name there but the only
real advantage amounts to a 120 Hertz
refresh just 20 Hertz higher than the
panel we've recommended from AOC and a
somewhat superior IPS panel these
features cost you an extra five hundred
and forty dollars compared to the AG
three five to you CG which is absolutely
not worth it those after a free sync
monitor should grab the Samsung c 34 F
seven nine one which uses an SV a
quantum dot panel and supports a 100
Hertz refresh along with the 34 40 by
1440 resolution it is slightly more
expensive than the sous MX 34 VQ of
recommended in the past but you get a
better panel with a larger gamut
for most of this video we've been
talking about mana as therefore in the
middle to upper range of pricing for a
lot of you that's too much money so in
this final category we're moving to the
more budget end of the spectrum rather
than recommending a dirt-cheap 1080p 60
Hertz model I've gone with a 1080p 144
Hertz display as these mourners there's
such good value these days while you
might not get the highest resolution or
the best display tech having a high
refresh rate does improve the game
experience particularly if you can drive
games more than 100 FPS the monitor
we're recommending in this category is
the AOC g2 460 PF a 24 inch 1080p TN
display with the 144 Hertz refresh and
free sync available for a touch under
$200 from Amazon this is essentially the
cheapest model available with this
hardware and even packs features like a
height adjustable stand visa mounting
and a 350 in maximum brightness yeah
it's not g-sync so it's not adaptive
sync compatible with NVIDIA GPUs but
$200 is the cost of just the g-sync
module so it's not really possible to
get a budget monitor at this price with
J sync inside if you're interested in
any of the monitors we've discussed in
this video links to those are in the
description below I will go through an
update this list later in the year when
those new HDR and high refresh high
resolution monitors become available but
until then it's back to the benchmarking
see you next time
