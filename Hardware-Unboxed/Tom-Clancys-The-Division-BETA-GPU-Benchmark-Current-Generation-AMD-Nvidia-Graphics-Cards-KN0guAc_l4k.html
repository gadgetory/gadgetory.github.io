scheduled for release to the eighth of
March but those who pre-ordered the game
were given a preview of what was to come
in the form of a closed beta over the
weekend having recently featured the
division in my top 10 PC games coming
out in 2016 it's obviously on my radar
so I took up Hoover soft offer to
preview the game we've limited time to
test the open-world third-person shooter
I didn't get much sleep over the weekend
still being sleep-deprived was well
worth it as the game is extremely
exciting the awesome game player did
make the benchmarking portion a lot more
painful than usual and the whole time I
just wanted to join in with everyone
else in the dark zone since this is only
a beta preview of the game and with a
few months of possible development to go
we won't be covering everything we would
the game has been officially released so
keeping that in mind let's move on to
check out how the quality presets
compare before jumping into the
benchmark results for some reason the
low quality preset viewing angle is
different to the other three precess
despite the character position and
viewing angle going unchanged visually
the difference between ultra and medium
for example is very limited and we had a
hard time telling the difference between
the two throughout the game the same is
true for this next series of comparison
shots the ultra quality preset looks
darker and while it is slightly darker
the difference isn't as Extreme as what
you're witnessing here this is because
the games day and night cycle makes it
very difficult to compare footage from
the same time of day after changing each
preset the game needs to be rebooted and
in that time the in-game time of day can
change quite a bit still overall it
doesn't appear to be a drastic
difference between the ultra and medium
quality settings moving on let's take a
look at this section of the game used
for benchmarking accurately benchmarking
the division is a little tricky due to
the fact that you don't already load
into the game in the exact same position
at least assuming you don't exit the
game in the same area to get around this
i started my bench might pass at the
helipad where you first dropped off and
after recording the framerate return to
the same spot for exiting the test this
was a lot like having to do the test
twice every time which was a bit of a
bummer the benchmark past ran for 80
seconds and the performance is very rare
what you'll find in other various
districts throughout New York you'll
also encounter other online players in
this section of the game just as you
will in the dark zone though no combat
can take place here the pass also
includes a varying range of indoor and
outdoor environments and we found the
CPU usage was surprisingly high in this
test when using the core i7 6700 k
data scanned downloading files got a bit
of eggs indicated using the ultra
quality preset we find the division is
extremely demanding at 1080p the gtx 960
for example average does 28 FPS whereas
the i-9 380 on the other hand was
considerably faster with 39 FPS AMD's
radeon GPU is performed exceptionally
well in the beta version especially
considering AMD is yet to release an
updated driver for the game the only
issue we notice with the AMD cards that
did tend to dip down to lower frame
rates in their equivalent in video
counterparts the r9 390 X for example
was four percent faster than the GTX 980
when comparing the average frame rate
for twenty one percent slower when
looking at the minimum frame rate oddly
these extreme minimums didn't impact the
fury X or nano graphics cards jumping up
to 1440p wiped out the lower end cards
and here we see the gtx 960 and I 9380
both averaging less than 30 fps even the
GTX 970 and r9 390 struggled in a 239 TX
to reach 240 FPS average given what
we've seen so far I wasn't expected that
we'd find playable performance at 4k
using a single GPU solution and that's
exactly what we found the fury ax came
out on top here with the 29 FPS average
while the GTX 980 TI was good for just
26 FPS reducing the quality preset at 4k
from ultra too high for to the fury acts
around seventeen percent more
performance and the GTX 980 TI
twenty-seven percent more performance
still with the average frame rate for
these high-end GPUs just over 30 fps it
looks like those hopeful for some 4k
gaming in the division with a single GPU
we need to lower the quality settings
quite a bit before wrapping up the
benchmarks let's see how various quality
presets impact performance and some
mainstream GPUs in the gtx 960 a 993 80
as seen previously the ultra preset
hammers these mainstream GPUs and in the
process pushes frame rates below
desirable levels already we see a
massive thirty-four percent performance
increase from the i9 380 and forty-six
percent for the gtx 960 we're moving to
the high quality preset going from high
to medium allowed both graphics cards to
increase the average frame
by thirty percent or more the geforce
gtx 960 saw a one hundred percent
performance improvement when going from
the ultra preset to the medium preset
and honestly the image quality
difference isn't that significant it
certainly doesn't come anywhere near
justifying the performance here before I
make any comments about the gameplay and
performance and tom clancy's the
division let's make it clear one more
time the game is still in the beta
testing stage as time she could end up
playing quite differently once
officially released in March having said
that I think the division looks
outstanding despite maybe not quite
living up to all the promotional
material we've seen over the past few
years nevertheless for an open-world
game the visuals are pretty amazing I
was particularly impressed with how
awesome the snow storms will can they
rolled in the dynamic way there is a
cool feature and I enjoyed how to change
the combat the night and day cycles
dynamic weather events in gorgeously
detailed see all combined to make the
division a truly spectacular environment
to play in if there's just one can plan
I have about the gameplay it's that at
times the big city setting feels too big
due to lack of enemies at times a
character would run for kilometers into
unexplored territory only to find
nothing worth throwing around that so a
lot of time is spent running around and
not running into much even in the
dangerous dark zone we're still is when
you do run into some ill-equipped
looters and you stock standard arsenal
of weapons makes extremely short work of
them this is all pretty easy to fix in
perhaps it will be once the game is
released formance wise the game runs
really well though that of course
depends on the quality settings use
unfortunately the short betta run didn't
afore be enough time to tinker with all
the settings so I can really only
comment on how the forest and a preset
Rico performance game looks best on the
ultra precepts obviously isn't
surprising however dropping down to the
hype reset has almost no impact on the
digital quality well it does have a
hugely positive impact on frame rate
this is great news for game is rocking a
gtx 960 or r9 380 as it is possible to
achieve playable performance using the
high priest at an extremely payable
performance with the medium preset those
want you to play a porque using a fury
XO GTX 980 TI will have to settle for
the medium quality preset once the game
is released we can to do some cpu
testing as a game appears particularly
taxing year as mentioned earlier the
6700 k was often loaded at around fifty
percent or greater not something we're
used to seeing in games I hope my betta
performance review is giving you some
idea of what should be required to play
tom clancy's the division when it is
released on march the eighth remember
these figures could change quite a bit
with the final product and new drivers
