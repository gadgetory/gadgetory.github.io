video a big thank you to our sponsors
for making this year's Computex coverage
possible
check out courses fancy new RGB memory
and for a limited time purchase any
select msi Intel based motherboard or
gaming desktop and get a free game pack
worth up to $180 with titles such as
Warhammer vermintide 2 or X morph on
offer you can't go wrong check the link
in the video description to learn more
welcome back to harbor unboxed we are at
the cooler master booth and as usual
cool master does have quite a few new
products on display a couple of nice
cases some case mods that you can
actually buy to put in your case so that
is something we're definitely going to
be looking at of course there is the
wraith ripper heatsink and that's
something that we're also very keen to
check out some other all-in-one liquid
coolers as well so let's go check all
that stuff out alright so we have the
wraith ripper and i'm trying very hard
not to drop this it is quite heavy it's
probably one of the biggest air coolers
you're going to come across and it is
designed for the new 32 core thread
ripper cpu so pretty impressive that
they can air cool that thing it does
have seven heat pipes not exactly sure
how much it weighs but i can tell you it
is quite a lot we have addressable RGB
you can see it on the top and you've got
the AMD rise and thread ripper logo so
it's going to look great through a
tempered glass side panel you'll be able
to really show that off excited to see
it and it will be coming to market later
in the when we do get the
second-generation thread ripper cpus no
pricing or any that sort of information
available yet but yeah very keen to IC
this one it does hit shelves before we
move on he's a few close-up shots of the
wraith ripper as you'd no doubt expect
the base plate is huge and allows for
full tear for socket coverage there are
seven copper heat pipes in total and
these extend from one side of the heat
sink down into the base and then back up
into the opposite bank of fins embedded
in the middle is a 120 millimeter fan
which i guess you could say is set up in
a push-pull configuration again it can't
wait to get my hands on this one test it
out in the benchmark lab to see how well
it really handles Coolermaster also had
a concept for the hyper 212 on display
and it was really only a matter of time
before they took their most popular
cooler ever and created a true successor
this concept model manages to cram in 25
percent more fins when compared to the
hyper 212 evo and not only that but they
also added an additional heat pipe
taking the total heat pipe count to five
although beefier than its predecessor
coolermaster still promises broad
compatibility even with high-profile
memory modules another concept cooler
cooler master was proudly showing off
was an all-in-one liquid cooler
featuring thermoelectric technology we
didn't get too much info about this one
but I'd love to test it on something
like a core i7 8700 K to see what it can
really do a product that looks like it
will come to market is their new
all-in-one transparent liquid cooler
cooler master says this new design
increases performance and allows users
to see the pump working
so that's pretty cool the addressable
RGB lighting also illuminates the
circular pump and provides some very
eye-catching effects moving on from
coolers cooler master had their V series
power supplies on display it's been
years since the original V series
launched and to date the v12 1200 has
been the only Platinum rated PSU
featured in the series Kula master has
stated they will be releasing a new line
of E Series units with a platinum
efficiency rating with at least three
different wattage levels on display we
found the V 1300 one thousand and 850 so
I guess those three models will be
thirteen hundred one thousand and eight
hundred and fifty watts Coolermaster
announced for the first time ever they
have designed and manufactured their own
PSU completely in-house everything from
the internal design concept to the final
testing has been done exclusively by
Kula masters in-house product
development team this power supply is
currently being referred to simply as
the XG cooler master claims that this
brand new power supply platform is not
only a milestone for them as a company
but for the entire PSU market moving on
cooler master was also showing off the
brand new sk line of keyboards
consisting of three different models the
sk six 20s k6 30 and sk 640 this line
features unique cherry MX low profile
switches on a brushed aluminium top
plate RGB illumination type-c detachable
cable and LED light bar that frames the
keyboard all this packed into a
minimalistic design the really cool
thing here is that these keyboards are
also wireless so they do have a lithium
battery inside and you can charge out
using the type-c cable so great to see a
few more wireless mechanical keyboards
this case 620 features a 60 percent
compact layout ideal for traveling the
SK 630 is an 80% compact layout while
the SK 640 is a 100% 104 key layout
moving around to the K section of the
booth we came across the master case SL
600 M which Coolermaster says users
chimney based heat regulation and this
is an efficient way to blend together
silent technology with gaming
performance in short this means the case
draws cool air in from the bottom and
exhaust the hotter air through the top
panel the case is wrapped in aluminium
giving it a very sleek appearance that
looks and feels very premium and one
feature I really really like about this
case is the top mounted USB ports check
this out those are the USB ports you're
looking for there were loads and loads
of cases on display so we won't cover
all of them but one probe that we've
stumbled upon and it doesn't really have
an official name yet it is called the
modular bracket so basically what this
does is it allows you to mount all your
hardware on a 20 degree angle very
unique something that we haven't really
ever seen before it's an accessory that
will be sold separately and it does fit
most of the cooler master cases so you
can see it in the one back here we have
a very interesting product and we're
keen to try it out you might even got to
make a standalone sort of test system
out of this very interesting product I
call the master I later learnt this mod
which will be coming to market as an
accessory for most cooler master ATX
cases was designed by a model whose name
I can't pronounce so I won't risk
butchering it it was originally designed
and entered into the player knowns
battlegrounds battle mods Asia 2a 2017
with project cross hairs very cool stuff
indeed and I really hope colormaster are
able to bring this thing to market very
soon anyway that is going to do it for
the Coolermaster booth coverage at
Computex 2018 I hope you enjoyed the
video and I'll catch you again real soon
in another video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
