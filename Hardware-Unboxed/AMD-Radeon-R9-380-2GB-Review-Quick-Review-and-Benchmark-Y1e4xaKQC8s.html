I'm your host Matt and today we've got
the first exclusive look at AMD's Radeon
r9 380 let's get down to it the i9 380
is a rebadged r9 285 while it is based
on their latest GCN 1.2 architecture
it's still a three and a half year old
card at its core like the three and a
half year old HD 7950 and the r9 285 the
r9 380 is equipped with 1792 SPU's 112
ta use and 32 ROP s making the only
improvements that can affect performance
the increased clock speeds a380s clock
speed of a thousand megahertz it's nine
percent faster than the 285 but the
memory frequency remains the same one
thousand three hundred and seventy-five
megahertz
unfortunately the r9 380 suffers the
same Achilles heel as the 25 did before
it a 256-bit memory bus
this is trumped by the y r9 280 and the
HD 7950 which both featured a 384 bit
memory bus and a three gigabyte frame
buffer as a result despite the increased
clock speed the i-93 80 is going to
suffer when comparing bandwidth
performance
Yano 380 will give you higher fill rates
and better compute performance however
you could get all-around better
performance by overclocking the r9 280
having said all that it's time to see
exactly what the r9 380 produces in the
real world
we'll be benchmarking it at 1080p let's
see how it performs in Crysis 3 the 380
produced 41 frames three frames higher
than the 285 and two friends more than
the GTX 960 in battlefield hardline we
saw the three to get a smooth 60 frames
per second just one frame more than the
o.9 285 and 4 less than the GTX 960 in
dying light the 380 gave us 40 frames
the exact same as the r9 285 and 2 less
than the GTX 960 in grand theft auto 5
the 380 produced an average of 56 frames
which was three more than the 285 but
five less than the GTX 960
finally in match
Redux the 380 gave us 45 frames per
second this was the exact same as the i9
to 85 and 6 frames slower than the GTX
960 the i9 380 performed much as
expected with at only slightly improved
hardware on average it was just 6
percent faster than its predecessor the
r9 285 but it can be had for about the
same price the 200 u.s. it represents
pretty good value for gamers on a budget
that are looking to play games at 1080p
but if you're looking to play on any
higher resolutions you aren't going to
be able to play the latest triple-a
titles compared to the GTX 960 the r9
380 s performance is pretty close just
5% slower over the five games that we
tested and fittingly they're at the same
price point given that the GTX 960 did
come out slightly on top and the fact
that it consumes less power we probably
still prefer that card for now this has
been mapped for Hardware on box thanks
for watching our exclusive first look at
the r9 380 don't forget to hit like hit

the comments and head over and watch our
other r9 300 series videos see you next
