are checking out and videos the latest
attempt to excite gamers and this time
it is with the mid-range GPU I'm sure
you're familiar with the gtx 1660 TI at
this point probably comes as no surprise
it's been rumored for quite some time
now the recent leaks basically confirmed
its existence down to the exact specs
and pricing that said while not
surprising the release itself does seem
a bit odd this is because envy has been
pushing their RT x series is the holy
grail for gamers in reality though it's
a whole lot less miraculous than that
and perhaps that's why we are seeing
them trim down the chirring GPU and cut
off a bit of the fat to create the 1660
TI and after all the RT intensive calls
they're basically useless on a mid-range
part so anything lower end is going to
be completely useless
Nvidia tells us they've dropped these
architectural features in order to
provide a sub $300 u.s. cheering GPU and
while that's fair enough and I also
doubt many of you will miss the ability
to enable ray tracing or DL SS today's
video sponsor is PCB way if you're after
a custom PCB for your next project look
no further they make high quality PCBs
at affordable prices right now new
members get a $5 bonus which covers
their first order of ten one to two
layer
PCBs and they also offer an assembly
service furthermore right now all PCB
assembly orders enjoy free shipping
worldwide so check them out link is in
the video description
although NVIDIA has trimmed off the fat
we do still get the new sm units
featuring dedicated calls for processing
FP 32 and integer operations
simultaneously as well as FP 16
processing at double the rate of FP 32
well also including the latest
advancements in programmable shading the
new sm units also feature enhanced
caches for increased capacity and
bandwidth compared to the RT x 2060 the
gtx 1660 TI packs 25% fewer cuda cores
but because it also drops the RT and
tensor cause the die is 36 percent
smaller then when compared to the pascal
base gtx 1066 gigabyte the six
sixty TI's diet is 42% larger but only
packs 20% more criticals
of course as I just mentioned the cause
had been upgraded and are now much wider
this new model also comes with six
gigabytes of gddr5 teen hundred
megahertz for ddr o'clock of six
gigahertz and a data rate of twelve
gigabits per second using a 192 bit wide
memory bus that results in a peak
throughput of 288 gigabytes per second
which is a 14 percent reduction in
bandwidth compared to the r-tx 2060 but
13 percent higher than the 1070 and 50
percent more than the 1060 given the
specs were expecting the 1660 Ti to
offer gtx 1070 lat performance at the
$280 u.s. price point which would
finally be some good news for gamers for
testing I'll be looking at performance
in a dozen titles and then hopefully
sometime soon I'll be checking out
30-plus games also the focus for this
video will be on 1080p and 1440p
performance before we get into the
results a few quick notes on the test
system the test system included a kora
999 or okay clocked at 5 gigahertz with
32 gigabytes of ddr4 3,200 memory as for
the drivers adrenaline 2019 Edition
nineteen point two point two for the
Radeon GPUs was used and then game ready
for 1891 WH QL for the GeForce GPUs ok
let's get into the results first up we
have shut off the Tomb Raider and crikey
the GTX 1660 Ti it looks mighty
impressive matching the gtx 1070 tie
with 87 FPS on average at 1080p this
allowed it to basically match of ager 56
and therefore destroy the RX 590 by an
almost 40% margin it remained lethal at
1440p as well again matching the gtx
1070 to I am beating the RX 590 by an
impressive 41% margin for so horizon for
was actually one of the first games I
benchmarked and I was shocked to find
the GTX 1662 is so close to the RT X
2060 we've already seen that the Turing
GPUs at that much faster than their
Pascal counterparts in this title and in
the case of the RT X 2070 it's actually
a little slower than the 1080 that said
the 1660 T I had no trouble keeping up
with the gtx 1070 and as a result was
just 5% slower than the 2060 we see much
the same at 1440p in fact
the 1662 I was just a single frame
slower than the 2060 I don't expect
we'll see many more results like this
though keeping frame rates above 60 fps
and just cause for certainly isn't easy
but even so the GTX 1660 Ti is now by
far the best sub $300 u.s. GPU in this
title averaging 73 FPS at 1080p making
it 14 percent faster than the rx 590
similar margins are also seen at 1440p
here the 1660 TI matched the gtx 1070
and this minute was just a few frames
slower than AMD's Radeon Vega 56 then we
see the GTX 1660 TI slaying in resident
evil 2 with an impressive 108 FPS on
average and this placed it between the
1070 and 1070 TI so solid result there
it maintained this position at 1440p and
in a strong title for AMD it was still
11% faster than the Radeon rx 590 so
again another very solid result here for
in videos new sub $300 GPU hitman 2 is a
bit odd at 1080p that said this is
mostly because we are looking at a GPU
bottleneck scenario at this resolution
so moving the 1440p gives us a better
idea of how these GPUs compare and here
we see the 1662 are roughly matching the
gtx 1070 making it just 12% slow in the
RT x 2060 I think it's fair to say the
16 60 Ti is going to be a very popular
choice amongst fortnight players it's by
far the cheapest way to push well past
100 FPS using the higher quality
settings it also proved very capable at
1440p pushing well over 70 FPS
throughout our test run once again
you're looking at gtx 1070 light
performance metro Exodus is an exciting
new game that we've already covered in
depth on the channel but obviously this
is the first time we've been able to
test it with the gtx 1660 TI performance
at turn DP is respectable and again
we're seeing gtx 1070 like frame rates
the same performance margins were seen
at 1440p and here the 1662 i matched the
1070 making it 30% faster than the 6
gigabyte 1060 it seems that Rainbow six
siege always provides us with
interesting results and today's review
is no exception for the most part the
gtx 660ti
mirrored the gtx 1070
performance but here it shudders it in
fact it manages to even edge out the GTX
1080 much the same was seen at 1440p
here the 1662 I matched the GTX 1080
making at sixteen percent faster than
1070 and 58 percent faster than the 60
year by ten sixty while it was just two
percent slower than Vega 56 here we see
our updated battlefield 5 testing saw
the GTX 1662 I come in just behind the
GTX 1070 at 1080p but with 90 fps on
average it was a good step up from the
GTX 1060 then at 1440p we see much the
same here the 1662 I was again slightly
slower than the GTX 1070 though with
just two fps in it you could comfortably
say that provided the exact same
experience not only that but with over
60 fps rendered during our test it
provided highly played performance in
battlefield 5 or 1440p interestingly the
1662 I was unable to match the GTX 1071
World of Tanks at 1080p here it was 7%
slower that's by no means a big margin
but still it's rare to see a new
cheering GPU coming in behind the 1070
it did however manage to beat Vega 56
and therefore was almost 40% faster than
the rx 590 then at 1440p we again see
very similar results vega 56 does creep
ahead for the average frame rate but is
down for the 1% lower result still 35%
fast and the Radeon rx 590 the 16 60 TI
more than gets the job done as a new
ultra popular battle royale title we
have of course included apex legends and
here the gtx 1660 TI spat out 123 FPS
eternity p making it a whisker fast of
the mega 56 and a whisker slower than
the gtx 1070 TI it was also just 16%
salt in the RT x 2060 so pretty good
result they're moving the 1440p and here
we find much the same the 1660 TI is
found position between the 1070 TI and
vega 56 making it nine percent faster
than the vanilla 1070 and 55 percent
faster than the 60 here bite 1060
wrapping up the gaming benchmarks we
have the new Far Cry title new dawn the
results of basically the same as what
we've seen previously when testing with
Far Cry 5 not overly surprising given
err that's the same world environment
dame engine and so on anyway here the 16
sixty-two I match the gtx 1070 making it
a little slower than vega 56 then at
1440p as we've seen numerous times
already the margins remain very much the
same that being the case we again see
the 1662 eye matching the performance of
the gtx 1070 now when it comes to power
consumption the GTX 1662 I push total
consumption to just 271 watts making it
very efficient basically you're getting
gtx 1070 light performance for an 8%
power saving for the total system i'm
not going to bother comparing that with
vega 56 you can see the difference for
yourself plus vega 56 has to be modified
before it can be placed on a power graph
like this you know stand it out of the
box stuff under vaulting it till it's
running on lemon juice sorry about that
sarcasm but in all seriousness this is
really what you can expect from baker 56
and 64 out of the box same goes for
Radeon 7s for the operating temperatures
the msi gtx 1660 TI gaming ex model we
use for testing was whisper quiet even
after an hour of heavy load the fans
only spun up to around 1500 rpm and this
allowed a pic GPU temperature of just 66
degrees in a 21 degree room very
impressive stuff from a relatively small
graphics card incredibly when
overclocked the card maintained
basically the same operating temperature
and fan speed running just a single
degree warmer that said the operating
frequency was only boosted by 4% on
average but we were able to massively
increase the memory speed increase in
the data rate from 12 gigabits per
second to 15 gigabits per second and
this was the maximum speed the MSI
Afterburner utility will actually allow
us to hit so despite just a 4% increase
in core clock the 25% boost in memory
speed allowed for an 8% increase when
testing with fire crying you Don I know
not exactly mind blowing stuff but
that's a pretty typical overclock for a
modern Nvidia graphics card okay so
we've got a pretty good idea now of how
the new geforce gtx 1660 TI performs out
of the box how the MSI gaming ex model
overclocks how efficient it is all that
stuff but now what I want to know is how
exactly does it stack up against
previous generation products such as the
GTX 1060 the 1070 and
the new RCX 2060 and then some GPUs from
AMD the Radeon rx 590 Vega 56 and all
that so let's go do that now the gtx
1660 Ti is actually a pretty decent
upgrade over the gtx 1066 gigabyte at
least depending on the title still on
average it was 38% faster at 1080p and
40% faster at 1440p and that right there
is a big performance boost and certainly
justifies spending the $280 u.s. in my
opinion especially if you're looking at
getting into 1440p gaming upgrades aside
you wouldn't even entertain purchasing a
gtx 1066 hereby anymore i mean you
shouldn't have been any way as the RX
580 was much better value but point is
the gtx 1060 is now very much a dead
product anything north of $200 u.s. and
i wouldn't give it a second look as you
no doubt expecting based on what we'd
seen previously the gtx 1660 TI is kind
of the new gtx 1070 but of course at a
lower price point sure the performance
does vary a bit in a few titles but for
the most part we are looking at a
single-digit performance difference we
see the same true percent performance
difference at 1440p the 1662 I performed
well in Rainbow six siege shut off the
Tomb Raider and apex legends but as I
said overall the performance was much
the same it's interesting to note that
the sixteen sixty Ti is twenty percent
cheaper than the r-tx twenty sixty but
at 1080p was just twelve percent slower
you could of course argue the twenty
sixty is better value because of those
RT and tensor cores that enable
ray-tracing addy LSS but we discovered
such a claim for those of you wondering
the sixteen sixty TI was again twelve
percent slower at 1440p so let's move on
to check out a few comparisons with some
AMD radeon gpus okay so compared to the
similarly priced rx 590 the gtx 1660 TI
was 24% faster so 24% more performance
for an eight percent price hike not only
that but worst case the 1662 I was still
seven percent faster than the rx 590 and
best case up to forty six percent faster
so it's clearly the better Buy I've been
saying it for months now expect rx 590
price drops and while we have already
seen $20
shaved off the launch price you can't
expect that figure to grow now the 1662
eyes on the scene the margins were much
the same at 1440p here the 1662 I was
25% faster so like I said very similar
to what we saw at 1080p finally we have
Vega 56 which typically sells for $400
and sometimes you'll come across a crazy
sale where they drop down much closer to
$300 I think there was a bargain sale
recently for around 330 dollars u.s.
anyway the GTX 1662 I was just seven
percent slower on average and even if
Vega 56 was to sell for $330 again the
1662 I would still be 15% cheaper
making it the better value by not to
mention much much more efficient okay so
we're getting close to wrapping this up
time for our cost per frame analysis
give it everything we've seen so far it
expect the 1660 to either fare very well
here and it does basically looking at a
similar price to performance ratio as
that of the Radeon rx 580 which is
incredibly good news for gamers this is
because the 1660 Ti is an entire tier
above the rx 580 so for it to deliver a
similar cost per frame is absolutely
great news with a similar level of
performance to Vega 56 the GTX 1660 Ti
comes out at a saving of 25% per frame
it's also 19% more cost-effective than
the GTX 1066 gigabyte the least
impressive comparison can be made with
the RT X 2060 here it was just 9% more
cost-effective which is still an
impressive margin and I'll talk more
about this in a moment in video released
the first churring based GPUs back in
September of last year and in my opinion
it wasn't until they released the RT X
2060 that we got a well rounded model
that was worth buying do you fare the
r-tx 2080 ti it's an incredible beast
and I really love gaming with it at 4k
but it's also stupidly and I mean
absolutely stupidly overpriced $1,300
EOS yeah it's not quite that good if you
allow me to be blunt the RT X 2080 was a
snoozefest the same can be said about
the RT X 2070 in fact the 2070 was even
worse as it was effectively eliminated
by the 2060 just three months after its
release then for those of you that
hadn't yet nodded off aah
in with some elite-level ASMR with their
Radeon 7u GPU releases over the past six
months have been pretty underwhelming
that said the GTX 1662 is the first GPU
release in some time that I've come away
feeling really pleased with what we've
been given as I've already said we're
getting gtx 1070 light performance for a
slight price premium over the gtx 1066
gigabyte and while I know many of you
would have preferred it to be priced at
$250 without any competition from AMD at
the moment I think this is a pretty good
result
speaking of AMD this release puts them
in a rather tough spot previously the rx
580 was the obvious sub $300 option but
now the choice is much more difficult
and frankly I'd go with the 1660 Ti it's
only $80 more enough as higher tier
performance
in today's recently released games the
RX 5 ATS more of a 1080p solution
whereas the 1662 I can be used for
higher refresh rate 1080p gaming or
1440p gaming it's also much more
efficient and I expect all a IB models
to run cool and quiet as for Vega 56
well unless you can find one for $300 US
or less it's really not worth buying in
my opinion so again AMD's GPU division
really is in a tough position and
fingers crossed they can pull a rabbit
out of their hat with navi later in the
year that would certainly benefit all of
us in the meantime though the GTX 1660
Ti is the new sub $300 King and I'm not
at all concerned about the lack of RT
and tensor cause frankly I'd much rather
a GTX 20 atti with some extra cruder
cause I'd certainly be more compelled to
spend $1300 US on that anyway great to
see a new GPU worth buying and I was
very impressed with MSI's gaming X model
the card looks really good nice compact
design it runs cool and quiet and it's
able to overclock the GTX 60 and 60 Ti
to the max the only question left to
answer now is how much does it cost
exactly hard to say right now and
pricing is likely to be a bit all over
the place for the next few weeks but
with the RT X 2060 2017 and 2018 all
selling at the MSRP I expect the same
will be true for the GTX 16 60 TI before
too long anyway that is going to do it
for this one please
afraid to let me know what you think of
the GTX 1660 Ti down below in the
comment section let me know if you think
the review was well if it echoed your
thoughts do you think it's a good
product for the money so you very keen
to hear your thoughts as always and for
those of you that were hoping for more
than 12 games to be benchmarked and this
was more of a sort of a product review
slash review of the GPU anyway I will
have a 30-plus game benchmark hopefully
maybe tomorrow I will be benchmarking my
backside off as you watch this video so
I'm trying to get 30-something games
maybe about 35 games include a lot of
the newer games like the new Far Cry of
course apex legends we've already looked
at that though there's a few other new
games as well that will be included
anyway that is coming hopefully tomorrow
maybe a day or two there is a lot of
work involved it depends whether I pass
out or not anyway if you enjoyed this
video feel free to like button subscribe
for more content and if you appreciate
the work we do at Harrow box then
consider supporting us on patreon that
really helps us out and helps us to
create in-depth benchmark content and
all the other things that we do on the
