unboxed today we'll be taking a deeper
dive into the gaming power of aim DS
latest rise in mobile chips which
hopefully will be available in a wider
range of ultra portable laptops in the
coming months if you were specifically
eyeing off a rising mobile laptop for a
bit of gaming on the side this video
will be for you and I should say two
videos because I am splitting this
analysis up into two parts the first
part this video will be looking at how
the Rison 5 2500 you performs in popular
multiplayer and eSports titles like pub
G fortnight overwatch and more the
second part which will be coming in a
couple of days we'll be looking at newer
Triple A games like Assassin's Creed
origins The Witcher 3
shadow of war and a bunch of other
punishing titles the goal here isn't to
provide a whole stack of benchmark
charts pitting rising mobile up against
other laptops because we already sort of
know where this APU sits among faster
discreet GPUs and Intel super slow
integrated graphics instead I'll be
looking at what games can actually be
played on rise and mobile laptops at
what settings and with what sort of
framerate and experience there's gonna
be a ton of capture footage here so
you'll get to see exactly what it's like
to game with the rise in mobile laptop
before I get into the games it's worth
mentioning I tested everything on the HP
Envy x-360 a 15-inch slim and light
laptop with the risin 5 2500 you inside
and 16 gig of ram there is a faster rise
of mobile trip out there the horizon 7
2700 you which increases the integrated
Vega GPU shader core count from 512 to
644 a lot of extra performance
I haven't had hands-on time with this
fast APU just yet but when I do expect
an updated version of this video with
brand new data the first game I'll be
looking at is probably the one you'll be
most interested in prior unknowns
battlegrounds and that's not just
because the game is popular but because
it's well known to be a bit rough around
the edge
is to put it nicely on the horizon five
2500 year to get this game in the realm
of playability I had to set everything
to as low as it would go 1080p with a
70% render scale so the game is actually
running at 756 P along with everything
else set to very low even though the
game looks like utter garbage at these
settings it doesn't run well at all on
rise on mobile I was barely achieving 30
fps often dipping down to the mid 20s
and that's not really improved by
chucking the resolution down even
further to 720p or any lower
some games are okay to play around the
30fps barrier but pub G isn't one of
those so the game ends up feeling
extremely sluggish and difficult to
control at these frame rates and just
think this is kind of what it's like to
play pub G on the Xbox one which is a
bit disgusting to be honest anyway
hopefully with more optimization work
down the track this game won't run like
a turd sandwich on rising mobile forever
the big competitor to pub G these days
is for tonight's battle royale mode and
you'll be pleased to hear this game runs
a lot better on ROS and mobile which I
guess isn't that hard to do I set the
game to 1080p native resolution with
everything else set to low and
throughout most of the matches I played
I was hovering around the high 30s to
low 40s framerate now this isn't the
highest framerate for a game like this
but there is room to reduce the render
resolution down to 720p and hit that
60fps sweet spot even when playing at
full 1080p the game doesn't feel
sluggish and is perfectly playable in my
opinion it's pretty clear that if you
want a battle royale type experience on
a laptop it's for tonight where you'll
have the best time and just before I
move on to the next game fortnight it
doesn't run well at all on Intel's KB
like refreshed laptop CPUs you struggle
to get decent frame rates at 720p and
lowering the resolution further makes it
hard to spot enemies so rise and move
are really is the way to go for this
title can a strike global offensive is a
game you can sort of play on Intel's 8th
gen laptop CPUs
it's not really a great experience
hovering around 40 FPS at the lowest
possible settings but with the rise and
5 2500 you it's a very playable game in
fact it's one of the best performing
games I tested
Rison Mobile has no trouble hitting
consistent 60 FPS at 1080p with the
lowest detail settings and often you see
performance more around the hundred FPS
mark without a free sync display on the
HP Envy x-360 tearing was a big issue as
the game often hovered in the 60 to 100
FPS range where screen tearing can be
very noticeable however the actual game
performance here is fantastic and
there's clearly enough power in this
laptop to play csgo and have a lot of
fun in the process
probably the best game to play on rising
mobile in terms of performance is rocket
League this game runs really well on the
Rison 5 2500 views Bega 8 GPU so well
you don't need to play on the lowest
possible settings yes I set the render
detail here to the performance settings
with render quality at the quality level
bit confusing there but that's the way
it goes and there was even some Headroom
for FXAA low and of course the
resolution was set to native 1080p with
these settings in play the game ran
comfortably at 60fps which is what you
want to hit with the fast-paced game
like rocket League now we are talking
about the 200 FPS you can achieve on a
laptop actually built for gaming this is
a great result for rising mobile it's
also the sort of game that suffers the
least from playing low graphics settings
you know there's no distant enemies to
spot so a few jagged edges or low-res
textures has very little impact on the
core gameplay the one downside to rocket
League on laptop is it is best to play
with the controller so you'll need to
pack one along if you're planning on
playing on the go overwatch is a perfect
candidate for laptop gaming because it's
engine scales well across a range of
hardware here with the risin 5 2500 you
I used the low preset at 1080p with the
75% render scale so the game was
rendering at more like a 10 P however
despite the lower than native resolution
overwatch looks surprisingly
good and doesn't suffer from playability
issues resulting from the low-resolution
the best news and running the game at
these settings is the framerate
overwatch runs mostly at 60fps with some
occasional dips into the mid 40s but in
general the game is very playable like
csgo any gaming laptop will comfortably
run this game at hundreds of frames per
second but achieving around 60 FPS on a
feelin like a laptop without sacrificing
every shred of quality is no easy feat
the final game I'm looking at in this
video is also the game I'm probably the
worst at quake champions this title is
still in early access through Bethesda's
website though since last time I played
they've begun adding pad elements like
additional characters it's a fun
extremely fast paced shooter that I just
happen to be especially awful at in any
case this game is very playable with
similar settings to overwatch 1080p and
a low preset with the resolution scale
set to 75% this game looks a bit worse
here than over watch at the same
settings however quake can be played at
higher frame rates in most situations at
least 60 fps this is not a game you want
to play below 60 FPS so thankfully the
Rison 5 2500 U is fast enough for this
level of performance looking across all
six games here the only one that's not
particularly playable is pub G which
shouldn't come as much of a surprise
bought night is very playable at native
1080p while csgo and rocket League both
provides 60 Plus FPS also at this native
resolution with overwatch and quake
champions you will have to tone down the
resolution a tad however this is only to
ensure a 60 FPS experience the good
thing here as well is most of these
games don't run very well on Intel's UHD
620 integrated graphics in their cable
you wake refresh mobile parts so you do
get a genuine advantage purchasing a
Raisa mobile APU instead whether or not
companies choose to release laptops with
rice and mobile is another question but
the science here in terms of performance
at least are very promising
as mentioned earlier I'll have part
this analysis coming up in the next
couple of days which looks at more
graphically intensive triple-a titles
including some surprising results if
you're interested in buying a Raisa
mobile laptop there are only a few are
available but what we do have links to
