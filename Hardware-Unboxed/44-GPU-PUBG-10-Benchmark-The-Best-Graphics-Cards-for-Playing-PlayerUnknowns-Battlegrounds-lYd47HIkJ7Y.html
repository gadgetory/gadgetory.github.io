final coverage of pleura nones
battlegrounds or at least my final for a
little while anyway
this time we're checking out a GPU
performance by testing a massive range
of new and old graphics cards I'm going
to assume that anyone watching this
video knows exactly what pub G is so I'm
not going to introduce the game or
discuss its development history we know
when it comes to CPU performance the
games strongly favors Intel hardware and
really only requires four cause
providing they are clocked at at least
four gigahertz that said though the 6 &amp;amp;
8 core Eisen cpus provided respectable
performance despite the fact that the
game does heavily underutilize them
anyway moving on from CPUs we now have a
mega GPU battle where we'll be facing
off a heap of AMD Radeon and NVIDIA
GeForce graphics cards I should note
that pub G is an NVIDIA supported title
and in the early access phase did
heavily favor hardware from the green
team but whatever reason aimed it almost
always gets the rough end of the stick
when it comes to these hugely popular
titles actually the reasons probably
just money
Nvidia simply has more of it to throw
out developers having seen how
successful pub G was early on in video
got on board and before long we started
to see the GeForce logo appear on the
loading screen AMD has of course been
optimizing their drivers for the game
and we've seen numerous releases over
the past few months that address
performance still NVIDIA has been
playing the developer lootcrate game for
years now and you can rest assured
they've paid to win this battle for
testing I'm once again using the miramar
map and the benchmark pass runs for 60
seconds and I will be reporting the 1%
low and average frame rate based on an
average of 3 runs most of the testing
will be done using the ultra quality
preset though I do realize serious
players will be using lower quality
settings and I will touch on those
before the end of the video the latest
AMD and NVIDIA display drivers available
the time of testing have been used and
all graphics cards were tested on my
Corsair GPU test rig inside we have an
Intel Core i7 8700 K clocked at 5u Hertz
with 32 gigabytes of ddr4 3,200 memory
right so I think that's all the
important stuff without wasting any more
let's get to the results because there
is a boatload of them kicking things off
we have some real relics can you believe
it some of these models are three years
old now it's like 60 GPU years surely
still in spite of their advanced age
they've still managed to retain all
their memory and that's a good thing
because despite textures look like there
are a hundred and twenty GPU years old
pub G eats up plenty of vrm that said
though at 1080p memory usage isn't too
extreme though you'll still require some
serious GPU firepower if you want to
play using the ultra quality settings
for around 60 FPS on average gamers will
require an online fury or a gtx 980
graphics card from the previous
generation some noteworthy observations
to make here include the fact that the
gtx 980ti decimates the fury ax when
looking at the average framerate yet the
1% low figures are almost identical the
GTX 970 r9 390x provides virtually the
same performance while the r9 380 beat
the gtx 960 by a comfortable margin
offering 16% more frames jumping to
1440p and now not a single previous
generation GPU can deliver 60fps on
average not even the Titan X so that's
pretty shocking short of a gtx 980ti I
don't think I'd bother trying to play at
1440p using the ultra quality settings
with any of these GPUs give them what we
saw at 1440p there's no question that 4k
is really out of the question when it
comes to previous generation GPUs and
that certainly is the case the titan x
and gtx 980ti averaged just 30fps okay
enough vintage GPU action time for the
shiny new GPUs though some of these are
like 15 GPU years old now I suppose so
we are in desperate need of a new
generation anyway at 1080p for around 60
FPS gamers will require a geforce gtx
1066 gigabyte or perhaps even the Radeon
rx 580 interestingly we see a massive 32
percent or greater leap to the gtx 1070
and vega 56 gps when looking at the
average frame rate however once again we
see little improvement in the 1% low
results and in fact here the 1070 was
just 11
% faster than the 1060 increasing the
resolution of 1440 P we say that gamers
will require a Vegas 64 or gtx 1070 TI
graphics card for an average of 60 fps
here we do see massive performance gains
from the Titan X and GeForce GTX 1080 Ti
as they rendered around 40% more frames
on average that said though once again
we're looking at the 1% low figures the
margins are much smaller this time well
under 20% so that's obviously a lot less
impressive then once again we find the
4k resolution is just a bit too much
even for the latest generation GPUs
though you could probably make do with
the Titan X or GT X 1080 Ti here pretty
disappointing though given that I can
play games such as Battlefront 2 at 4k
using the ultra quality detail settings
with a plain old GT X 1080 and still
receive a smooth playable experience and
I'm sure I don't need to tell you that
the cam looks world's better even with
EA spoiling it with all the loot crate
nonsense moving on it's time to get your
specs out because here are all 33 GPUs
from the current and previous
generations all lumped into a single
busy graph here we have the 1080p
results and I won't go over everything
again feel free to pause the video if
you want to compare the new and old GPUs
then we have the 1440p results and again
pause if you want to inspect them a bit
closer all I'll say here is that damn it
this makes the GTX 1080i look very
mighty finally here all the 4k results
and again we see that there's really
only a single gaming graphics card
capable of delivering playable
performance and that GPU is of course
the GTX 1080 Ti as I was wrapping up the
testing for this one I thought to myself
I've only made about 300 benchmark runs
for this video the guys are gonna start
thinking I'm getting lazy on them so I
turn to our trusty and much-loved army
of patrons and ask them what graphics
cards they'd like to see tested at 10 EP
using the very low quality preset
basically a super vintage bonus round
made possible by our patrons GPU such as
the gtx 750ti the r9 280x 290 and to 90
x were all heavily requested so let's
see how they handle for those of you
wanting to play pub G at Terry P with
the very low quality settings it looks
like you'll see a respectable framerate
from the old HD 7970 and by extension
the r9 280x
the 7950 also did very well spinning out
58 FPS on average while the gtx 660ti
was good for 55 FPS the much-loved 750ti
did ok rendering 46 FPS and was actually
playable the rx 550 and GT 1030 still
can't provide player performance even at
1080p using the lowest possible quality
settings the once-mighty GTX 580 matched
the GTX 760 and was actually slower than
the gtx 660ti which is quite interesting
the GTX 780 Ti though that did
surprisingly well given how Paul it's
aged and some of the more modern or more
advanced titles let's say in fact the r9
280 was only able to match the vanilla
GTX 780 and while that's still a good
result for the old AMD graphics card
it's generally much faster in modern
titles for those after a secondhand
graphics card for playing sort of low to
medium quality settings the GTX 780 r9
290 r9 280x 7970 and even the GTX 680
are all good options then wrapping
things up I thought since we have the
data let's compare the performance of
the ultra and very low quality settings
for the graphics cards that we've tested
starting with the GTX 1060 we see 59 FPS
on average with the ultra quality preset
but that jumps up massively to 115 fps
when using the very low quality setting
so that's a 95% increase similar gains
were also had with the RX 580 the r9 390
sees a 93% performance jump from the
ultra to the very low quality settings
though it did only hit 87 fps with all
the visuals way on down as the fastest 2
gigabyte graphics card tested the gtx
1050 provides an interesting result here
we see a massive 116 percent performance
jump and that's down the fact that the
ultra quality settings overwhelm the 2
gigabyte frame buffer by a massive
margin at 1080p that bottleneck is
alleviated using the very low quality
settings and now quite shockingly it's
able to match the RX 570 the rest of the
mid-range to low-end field also sees
massive gains when reducing the quality
settings from the maximum level to the
lowest
player unknowns battlegrounds is still
insanely demanding on the GPU so much so
that using the ultra quality settings
really isn't even an option for most
gamers now
this really wouldn't be an issue if the
game had a crisis type problem where
it's incredibly demanding because it's
incredibly good-looking and sets a new
benchmark for PC game visuals in fact
you really could argue that pub G looks
no better than the now decade old crisis
and in my opinion 2011 s crisis 2
actually looks better there's really no
need to compare the visuals and pub G to
that of sort of modern titles such as
battlefield 1 for example at that point
it really does just get a bit depressing
in spite of its open-world design pub G
really is a game that should play at
hundreds of frames per second on modern
hardware not 53 FPS on a Pascal time at
1440p with dips into the 30s
you could almost forgive the
unexplainably demanding yet poor quality
of visuals if the netcode was decent
other game developers must be sitting
there scratching their heads thinking
how can such a half-assed game be so
unbelievably popular anyway
enough about how utterly garbage the
game looks what you actually need to run
it well other than an Intel quad core
clocked at around four to 4.5 gigahertz
oh I'm talking about you know your Sandy
Bridge core i5s eye Ridge has well and
so on
you'll also need 16 gigabytes of RAM for
smooth gameplay and depending on the
quality settings you used you can get
away with a reasonably affordable GPU
again that is if you plan to play at
1080p using the lowest possible visual
quality settings as we just saw a
graphics card sporting a GPU such as the
r9 280x the RX 570 the r9 380 what do we
got from Nvidia the GTX 1050 that was
quite good the GTX 960 was over K and
the GTX 950 well that worked
surprisingly well for an old sort of
entry-level graphics card but if you're
hoping to play with the ultra quality
settings then i really suggest nothing
slower than an RX 580 or preferably the
gtx 1060 and that's only for 1080p
gaming for those wanting to play at
1440p you will need a truly high end GPU
for second-hand shoppers the GTX 950
looks like the GPU to be on the hunt for
they regularly go for $70 u.s. and offer
GTX 1050 light performance when using
the very low quality settings
it's also comparable to the HD 7970 in
the r9 380 both cost anywhere from
twenty to fifty dollars more on the
second-hand market when it comes to new
hardware the GTX 1060 does have the rx
580 beat meanwhile the gtx 1070 and Vega
56 graphics cards well they're quite
evenly matched though it has to be said
Vega 64 was consistently beaten by the
GTX 1080 no the margin wasn't that great
vega 64 though that does get trashed by
the GTX 1080 Ti though as you would
expect in videos flagship gaming GPU
delivers the best results and well
