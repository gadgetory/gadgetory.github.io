ago now and in that time a lot has
happened in the world of graphics cards
namely we've seen the release of
invidious high-end Pascal GPUs and more
recently the arrival of the mainstream
radian rxt 480 from AMD
upon release doom supported OpenGL
making it a rare title indeed today
nearly all games use some form of
DirectX however it was doomed claimed
support for Vulkan API that generated
the most buzz we were told volc√°n would
be patched in at a later date though it
was demonstrated running on NVIDIA GTX
1080 at their press day in Texas on May
the 6th since then I've been waiting
eagerly for the day when I open up steam
and finally see doing being patched up
to support Vulcan well yesterday was
that day Monday morning a fired up steam
to find a dim patch that enabled support
for Vulcan hell yet many of you are
probably aware the doom isn't the first
game to support Vulcan rather the Talos
principle was the first game to support
it
followed by dota 2 in May that said
dooms the first triple a title to use
Vulcan and as a fast-paced first-person
shooter it's an interesting pairing so
we can assume it's software has been
working with NVIDIA on dooms Vulcan
support but what about little old AMD
well the developer says it's worked with
both Nvidia and AMD on a daily basis
since late March to bring full doom and
Vulcan driver support to the community
like DirectX 12 volt is a low-level
application programming interface
however while DirectX 12 is the
successor of DirectX 11 Vulcan is the
successor of OpenGL a dated API are
created by Silicon Graphics way back in
1992 the Cranitch group obtained the
standard in 2006 and has been working on
successor ever since as a low-level API
Vulcan gives developers direct access to
the GPU and offers more efficient
multi-threading capabilities for the end
user this translates to better overall
performance and in the case of doom it
will allow those with older video cards
to run the game and much more acceptable
frame rates that being the case I'll be
comparing all the current generation and
most of the previous generation AMD and
NVIDIA GPUs in Doom using OpenGL and
Vulcan also be running a few old GPUs as
well to see what the benefits are for
those using legacy hardware to enable
Vulcan
doom simply navigate to the advanced
settings menu and switch the graphics
API from OpenGL to Vulcan the game then
resets exiting and then reloading as the
changes are being made before I jump
through the benchmarks here are a few
quick notes all tests were conducted
using my GPU test rig which is built
inside the corsair carbide 600c with an
Intel Core i7 6700 K clocked and locked
at 4.5 gigahertz for a full list of the
system specs please check the video
description you'll also find a detailed
video index there as well as always I'm
using reference AMD and NVIDIA graphics
cards unless otherwise specified
ok so first let's take a quick look at
how all these current and previous
generation GPUs compare using OpenGL at
1080p using the Knightmare quality
settings along with tssaa a we see that
the nano and Furious struggle against
the likes of the GTX 970 not something
you'd expect to see likewise the gtx 960
our piece is the r9 380 comfortably now
with Vulcan enabled ivory sorted the
graph from fastest to slowest and we see
quite a different lineup the GTX 980 for
example went from the 4th fastest
graphics card when using OpenGL to the
4th slowest with Vulcan
this is down to the fact that the 90s
performance is boosted by just three and
a half percent well the I know 390 for
example found an extra 51 percent which
is actually incredible even the new
affordable our X 480 is able to outpace
the GTX 980 when using Vulcan rendering
an impressive 128 FPS on average another
big shock is the r9 380 which went from
53 fps to 85 fps a massive 60% jump in
performance at the top of the AMD food
chain we find the fury acts enjoying
what's also a massive 52 percent
increase in performance this is an
incredible result for AMD as it means
the fury X is actually 8 percent faster
than gtx 1070 and just 14% slower than
the gtx 1080 moving up to 1440p let's
first take a quick look at the opengl
results again we see the nanos
strugglers against the GTX 970 while the
fury X is only able to match the GTX 980
the GTX 960 easily beats the r9 380 as
well
while the three 9390 X and our X 480 are
all slower than the GTX 970 resawing the
graph according to the performance found
when testing with Vulcan we again find a
very different picture a picture that
looks mighty encouraging for the red
team although the fury acts
wasn't able to beat the 10:17 this time
was just a single frame slower whereas
it was 18 FPS slower using OpenGL
meanwhile the GTX 980 is beaten by the
RX 4 ad albeit by a single frame
although you'll also find the 390 and
390x delivering even greater performance
towards the bottom of the graph the r9
380 can be found enjoying another 60
percent performance boost courtesy of
Vulcan finally at 4k here are the
results arranged by the OpenGL
performance the GTX 980 is again able to
match and even beat the fury acts by
single frame here the gtx 960 is 2 FPS
faster than the r9 380 while the GTX 970
was 1 to 2 FPS faster than the Ono 390
and RX 480 at 4k we find virtually no
difference between using OpenGL and
Vulcan with the Maxwell and Pascal GPUs
the gtx 1070 for example averaged 53 FPS
using both api's the fury acts however
was 40% faster at 4k when using Vulcan
allowing for a huge jump from 37 fps to
a very playable 52 FPS this jump also
placed the fury acts on par with in
videos 980ti and 1017 noteworthy gains
can be seen when looking at the recently
released our X 480 where we went from a
dicey 31 FPS using OpenGL to a much
smoother 42 FPS with Vulcan diono 390
and nano also saw similar gains
incredibly if the unknow 390x was just 2
FPS slower than the gtx 1070 using
Vulcan I believe the 390 X and 390
you're doing so well here in relation to
the fury X and nano due to the limited 4
gigabyte memory buffer of the HBM cards
The Fury axon nano is certainly powerful
enough to utilize more memory so this
could be an issue at 4k using the TSSAA
a setting before wrapping up the
benchmarks I wanted to take a look at
how some of the older AMD Radeon
graphics cards benefited from dooms
Vulcan support what I found was graphics
cards such as the Radeon HD 7970 in r9
280 didn't receive much of a performance
boost at all in fact the gains were
similar to what was seen with the Nvidia
Maxwell and Pascal GPUs initially I put
this down to them being GCN first gen
paths but the r7 370 debunked that with
a massive 110% gain using Vulcan the gcn
ii j9 290 enjoyed a 46% performance
boost and the r7 260x became 116 percent
faster I'm not willing to say there
aren't gains for the 7970 and 280 I've
seen some
on forums claim big gains for these
cards sadly though I wasn't able to
replicate those gains using my test
system
alright guys fasten your socks because
they're about to be blown clean off
previously we've seen the rx4 ad
generally consumes more power than in
videos previous generation Maxwell Bay's
GTX 970 and this is true for doom using
OpenGL here the our X 480 consumed
almost 4 watts per frame while the GTX
970 consumed just 3.2 watts per frame
however and this is the soft blowing
part with Vulcan the story changes
dramatically the RX 480 now consumed
just under three watts per frame while
the GTX 970 consumes roughly the same
amount of power that it did using OpenGL
for 3.2 watts per frame this makes the
rx 40 considerably more efficient when
using the Vulcan API and that's big news
for AMD we've seen how well AMD's GCN
architecture holds up in games such as
ashes the singularity and hitman these
are my opinion the most impressive
results yet Doom is a title that
predominantly favoured in video hardware
and this can still be seen when testing
with OpenGL however with Vulcan the
story changes completely and we're now
able to see the true potential of AMD's
GCN architecture seeing the fear X able
to match the gtx 1070 or 1440p and 4k
was inspiring and will no doubt have the
Radian 300 series owners very excited
not only to the high-end AMD GPUs
farewell but more importantly strong
gains can be seen on the lower end cards
with GPUs such as the r9 380 it was also
great seeing strong gains on truly
low-end discrete GPU such as the r7 370
and 970 260x oddly we didn't see any
real gains from the 7970 and 280 but
this could have just been an early
teething issue I expect there'll be
another update made to the game soon as
we did encounter a few issues when
testing often resolution changes would
result in strange and inconsistent
results forcing the game to be closed
after each setting change and then
reloaded
there was also the occasional crash and
is mostly impacted the green team in
fact I was unable to load the game using
a g4 6-years GPU so there could be an
Nvidia driver update in the works as
well thankfully we didn't see the NVIDIA
GPUs performance going backwards like
they're doing ashes of the singularity
using DirectX 12 at times the word gains
to be had although they only appear
under CPU limited scenarios such as the
1070 and 1080 or 1080p that said some
GeForce owners
reporting a decline in performance when
using Vulcan so I'll continue to do some
investigating with different hardware
configurations on that no performance
gains received when using the Vulkan API
will vary depending on the CPU used for
example a weak CPU with the strong GPU
will see much larger gains than pairing
a strong CPU such as the 6700 K of 4.5
gigahertz like we did with a strong GPU
by working closer to the metal Vulcan is
able to bypass the CPU and feed the
workload directly to the GPU so where
the CPUs performance was once really
important it's much less so now dooms
implementation of Vulcan is really
exciting and if this is a sign of things
to come then the future looks very
bright for AMD it seems like we've been
waiting forever for the GC and
architecture to pay off so could dooms
Vulcan support mark the turn of the tide
