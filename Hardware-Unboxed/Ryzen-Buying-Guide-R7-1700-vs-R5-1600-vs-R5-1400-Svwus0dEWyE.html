then hmm
you know looks like more rising content
rising buying guide which processor
should you buy just by whichever
processor you can afford okay so you
want to know what to buy fair enough I
suppose we should probably work and
happen thankfully I have done a bit of
the groundwork already as last week we
checked out the horizon 5 1400 quad core
as well as the 1606 call in the end that
comparison boiled down to just $50 and
when comparing the two processor
side-by-side that does say the 1600
price 30% higher however as noted
towards the end of that video if we do
look at the price comparison a little
more realistically it's actually not
nearly that much again the cheapest be
350 boards started around $70 us and
just factoring that in means the 1600 is
now just 20% more expensive throw in
some memory and now the premium is even
less in the end once you factor in the
total system cost $50 could account for
just a 5% price increase so looking at
it that way the 1600 seems like the
obvious choice however as noted in that
video I will still get to account for
the even more expensive 8 core verizon 7
1700 the 8 core monster cost 310 dollars
u.s. right now and that makes around 40%
more expensive in the 1600 that's
obviously a more significant margin
especially since you are only getting
33% more cores that said is it worth
investing in the 8 core model and if you
do what are the benefits well to answer
that I have compared all three of the
non x-rays and CPUs in a range of
applications and games to see where they
stand please note that once again I am
using a GeForce GTX 980 TI graphics card
for benchmarking this is done to try and
remove the GPU as the performance
limiting factor in my opinion high-end
GPUs are a good indicator of future
gaming performance that said though I
often do create content that will
feature lower end GPUs and typically
they're intended to answer a specific
question this though isn't one of those
videos
truth of the matter is if I was the test
would say the RX 580 for example then
for ninety percent of the games out
there that would simply be little to no
difference between the 1400 and 1700 so
just be aware of that now if you want to
know how these three CPUs will compare
once games become more demanding and
graphics cards grow more powerful then
the gtx 1080 TI will tell us all we need
to know with that let's jump into the
benchmarks first up I checked out memory
bandwidth performance and here we find
that the 1700 is good for almost 38
gigabytes per second as was the case
with the 1600 that's a very healthy
memory bandwidth for a dual channel
configuration Cinebench r15 shows us
just how much faster the 1700 is than
the 1600 assuming you can utilize those
additional cause out of the box the 1700
is 25% faster while extend that lead to
30% once both CPUs are overclocked
to 4 gigahertz clock for clock the 1700
also outscores the 1400 by an impressive
102 percent margin the excel results are
quite interesting and it does seem like
six cores is the optimal amount for this
application we have seen excel scale
well with up to 20 calls in the past but
for some reason here the 1700 doesn't
offer that much of a performance
improvement over the 1600 overclock the
1700 was just 11% faster which is again
a surprising find 7-zip on the other
hand scales very well with extra cores
here we see the 1600 is 50% faster than
the 1400 which makes sense given it has
50% more cause that said though the 1700
was just 32% faster than the 1600 for
the decompression test and just 12
percent faster for the compression test
so while faster than the 1600 the 6 core
model looks to deliver the best bang for
your buck in this test premier Pro
doesn't really take advantage of more
than 6 cores that well whereas the 1600
was 36% faster than the 1400 there's
1700 just 13% faster than a 1600 when
comparing all three CPUs clocked at 4
gigahertz so then even content creators
like myself will get the most bang for
their buck with the 1600 so measuring
power consumption I have used premier
Pro which in hindsight might not have
been the best move given the application
doesn't properly utilize the 8
or CPU that said we do still see an
increasing consumption with the eight
core CPU particularly once overclocked
clock for clock consumption increased by
14 percent which is very close to the 13
percent boost in performance seeing
we're moving from the 1600 to the 1700
okay so first up we have battlefield 1
and here's a 1700 and 1600 are virtually
identical even with the gtx 1080i
handling the rendering work although the
1600 was able to deliver 22% more frames
than the 1400 the 1700 was able to
improve upon that result the point 1
percent figure is a few frames better
but certainly not anything to get overly
excited about mafia 3 loves them cores
and we see this once again clock for
clock the 1700 was 9 percent faster when
looking at not just the average but also
the point 1 percent results not exactly
a mind-blowing result will admit but at
least the 8 core 1700 was able to offer
some kind of a performance advantage
here that said though the step from the
1400 to the 1600 did notice an extra 18
percent performance which was much more
significant ashes of the singularity
escalation is another cool Hungary game
and yet once again we see the 1700
offering a little advantage over the
1600 with just a few frames in at the
8-core processor certainly isn't worth
the premium over the 6 core model when
gaming that said though I am King the
retest DirectX 12 titles such as ashes
once bagra arrives next up we have
hitman and it's another hit job on the 8
core 1700 granted the 1700 doesn't
require any overclocking to get the most
out of the gtx 980ti but still once
match o'clock 4 o'clock with the 1600
there's nothing in it unsurprisingly
Deus Ex mankind divided isn't able to
provide the 1700 with an advantage over
the 1600 both CPUs allow the GTX 1080 to
I to churn out the exact same numbers
not much more needs to be said or really
can be said on this one we have a dead
heat here finally total war Warhammer
and damn it another time between the
1700 and 1600 again not a lot can be
said here both to 1,700 1,600 averaged
136 fps once overclocked
interestingly out of the box the 1600
was actually faster than the 1700
clearly it's managing the hit higher
operating frequencies anyway that wraps
up
testing okay so this little comparison
actually sums up Rison really well in my
opinion and it illustrates exactly what
I have been saying since the risin v
series was first released for me there
isin five release was much more
impressive than horizon seven though
that isn't to say there's anything wrong
with the risin seven series the problem
rather been there are a few mainstream
applications that really take advantage
of an eight core sixteen thread cpu and
really those that do are incredibly fast
on a six core or even four core
processor anyway there's definitely a
need and demand for eight core CPUs and
those with even more cores but that
demand isn't coming from the mainstream
market because as I said most software
simply doesn't take advantage of that
many cores
it's no secret that hardware box is
primarily a gaming focused channel and
right now games simply don't require
eight cores and this likely will be the
case for some time to come
nonetheless the eight core isin 7 1700
is an incredible buy just 310 dollars
u.s. particularly given the alternative
which is the crucially overpriced core
i7 6900 K at 1050 dollars u.s. the only
issue being what do you do with all
those cause if occupying eight cores is
beyond you right now then I suggest
turning to the golden ship of the
horizon line up the r5 1600 all gamers
will right now find the 1600 to deliver
the maximum bang for their buck and
let's take a closer look at what I mean
be aware that I'm comparing the minimum
frame rate data here and that figure is
used to divide against the CPUs total
cost to give us the cost per frame here
we think that in terms of value from a
gamers perspective the 1,400 and 1,600
are very evenly matched bang for your
buck they are much the same the 1600
just allows for a little extra
performance and will likely serve you
better down the track
comparing the 1600 and 1700 we find the
eight core model costs almost 40% more
while it delivered virtually the same
performance this isn't to say the
horizon 7 series is poor value or the
1700 isn't as good as the 1600 they are
the same physical chip after all the
1700 simply has all the cores enabled
and for that year stag are 40 percent
premium for those building a new system
from scratch the horizon 5 1600 is the
way to go in my opinion
realistically I would say consumers are
looking at spending around 600 to 700
dollars us on a new rig - the CPU that
allows for a decent motherboard 256
gigabyte SSD 16 gigabytes of memory and
mid-range graphics card and all the
other essentials throw in the risin 5
1,400 and the total bill comes out at
around $800 whereas if you use the 1600
it comes in at about 850 dollars and
that's just 6% more and that in my
opinion makes the 1600 an obvious choice
and a worthwhile upgrade to step up to
the 1700 we'll add around another 10% to
the cost of the total build which takes
the price to 950 dollars which honestly
is still very reasonable that's it the
game is you are throwing another 100
dollars us at a component that let's be
honest isn't really going to net you any
extra performance at least right now and
probably for the foreseeable if you took
that money and reinvest it into a GPU
that would indeed deliver a noticeable
performance improvement for gamers of
course another option would be to grab
an nvme SSD that might not be gaming
performance but it will make the system
on a hole that little bit snappier
anyway I'm going to recommend the rise
in 5 1600 as a CPU to get especially if
you are a gamer but of course I would
like to know what you guys think so let
me know in the comment section below
I'm always kini here or rather read your
thoughts yes I can read thoughts now so
be careful I'm your host Steve see again
soon guys
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
