up to the crown sky by Melbourne to meet
the guys behind jaybird a company
recently acquired by peripheral and
gadget monster Logitech I'd seen the
reviews for the jaybird x2's but never
had the chance to check them out myself
so I was really looking forward to
seeing what this new product had in
store from what I'd seen the ex tues
looked great but they did still look a
little chunky it really seemed like an
engineering impossibility though to pack
quality sound good battery life and a
sleek design into a set of wireless buds
but this is where the new freedom bud
set makes its mark firstly let's check
out the design and appearance I've got
the black colorway as well as the white
and gold color way on hand and both look
really nice the black is my personal
preference though now perhaps the most
impressive part of the design is how
small the earbuds are and how light the
whole package is as you can see the
earbuds are freaking tiny amazingly
they're smaller than a lot of wide
solutions and they're super light to
this whole kit waist is 13.8 grams that
looks like two bodies all sandblasted
metal and they both feel and look really
premium now Jay bird has been able to
construct these out of lightweight metal
and keep the size down by moving all the
electronics to the also quite small 3
button controller which itself has a few
tricks up its sleeve with these three
buttons you can control the volume skip
tracks play and pause answer and hang up
phone calls and switch the device on and
off the best trick however is being able
to boost your battery life by clipping a
little battery pack onto the controller
to give yourself an extra four hours
while you continue to listen now the
device alone advertises for hours of
playback but I actually found it was
closer to five the coolest part of the
charging clip is that it doesn't just
drain the clip and leave you with two
dead batteries it actually charges up
the bud set so you can then keep
listening while you recharge the clip
all around it's a really cool intuitive
system that really makes it easy to stay
on top of your battery life something
that's always been much needed in the
wireless earbuds space now I had a
creative and raised a set of earbuds to
compare the sound quality to and I've
got to say it was the least as good as
the creative set and better than the
razor set this is expected really as the
razor sets only worth fifty dollars but
it was nice to be able to tell the
difference the base from the freedoms
are surprisingly full
in both the mids and highs seemed really
rich and detailed on top of this you can
very quickly and easily customize the
equalizer on the fly using the jaybird
my sound app this is a really really
great touch and really helps round out
and separate this Wireless bud set from
the pack available for both Android and
iOS the my sound app gives you instant
and simple control over the equalizer
and adjusting yourself is both immediate
and intuitive there's also a bunch of
pre-configured eq's that you can tap it
apply and if settings to save to the
devices firmware so it's no need to
continue running the app again I really
think this is an awesome addition and I
definitely liked cranking the base up
for my listening sessions now all of
these features wouldn't really mean much
if the freedoms weren't comfortable and
didn't fit securely in ears to ensure
that they do both the wireless buds come
with three different sized silicone
eartips as well as three different sized
sports memory foam pieces too on top of
this you also have three different sized
ear fins which really helped to lock the
earbuds into place this system works
really well and it's the first time I
felt like I could really work out
without worrying about them coming loose
or falling out of course the fact that
their wireless helps immensely with this
but if you're using the memory foam tips
in conjunction with the silicon fins
with the cable set up over your ear
there's really no way they'll
accidentally fall out I was honestly a
bit dubious of the silicon fins having
never used them before and I was worried
they wouldn't be very comfortable to use
I actually find any of ours pretty
taxing on my ear canal comfort wise at
times but in conjunction with the fins I
think they're actually a lot more
comfortable I think when using normal
buds the combination of the wire and the
single weight bearing point in ears
resulted a lot of downward tugging in
the same direction putting a lot of
pressure on the same point I'm finding
with the jaybird freedoms though the
combining the silicon tips with the fins
results in a super comfortable we're
spreading out the admittedly small load
around the ear a little more and of
course they are wired to my phones they
don't tug downwards either this is
really the first set of earbuds I could
wear and forget about another vital
feature for a set of headphones designed
for workouts to sweat proofing CEO and
founder of jaybird Chad Armstrong tells
me they've been protected by three
layers of nano coating and even
challenged me to run them through the
wash for the video I didn't put them
through a cycle this time but I did do a
couple of water tests and they passed
with flying colors so I feel confident
that I've got nothing to worry about
when it comes to sweating all over them
bluetooth performance is great too one
of my housemates
a set of beats wireless buds and they
work well up to about five meters so
really you need to carry a device around
with you the freedoms live up to their
name giving you honestly close to 30
meters of reliable range with no walls
interfering I could leave my phone in my
gym bag do my full workout and
interrupted that's pretty damn cool you
can also do fancy things like can have
two sets of freedom buds to the same
device to synchronize listening with
your friend or connect to devices to one
set of buds so you can take calls while
listening to something on your laptop so
overall the jaybird freedoms honestly
seemed like the bee's knees in terms of
wireless workout headphones the tiny
light comfortable when the sound is
really great awesome Bluetooth range
makes them extremely convenient and the
fact that you don't need to worry about
getting them wet makes them really
suited to workouts the implementation of
the battery clip is really clever and I
fully expect other brands to follow suit
with this great combination of ideas you
can pick up the jaybird freedom wireless
buds today in Australia JB hi-fi or the
apple store for 249 95 if you look
around this is pretty competitive
pricing really for a premium wireless
set of buds and as far as I can tell
these are really the best overall
package you can get on Amazon they're
available for 199 95 to those in the USA
have you guys got to set a wireless buds
