of unboxing boxes with Steve I've
actually done this in a weird order I
was getting ready to get started my
two-year-old daughter came in she's
actually left a rabbit here and we sort
of unboxed a few things before we were
meant to yeah hey we've got a we're
going to open some of these boxes which
one should we start with pick a box
which one would you want to see what's
in that one alright let's check it out
we put we put bunny over here
let's eat bunny there now I need I need
a knife but I don't really want to use a
knife with you we'll try and do it
without a knife okay all right I'm gonna
say hello everyone on the camera wave to
the camera say hello good girl
alright helping me today I've got my
daughter two-year-old daughter Tessa she
just had her two-year-old injection so
she's a bit sad today aren't you yeah
yeah but we're gonna open some boxes
that'll cheer you up looking at dad's
work stuff yeah alright we'll see what's
in this one I think oh you're right I
think this is a present I bought for
myself to go with the present that Matt
bought for maybe here we go X Pro fluid
head so that should help with the b-roll
and filming we'll have a quick look at
it I've been pretty excited to get my
hands on this yeah you can have that if
you want oh we got the handle
and the head itself awesome very keen to
start playing with this I've already got
the tripod for it the camera is sitting
on it right now well there you go pretty
cool that was about I think it was about
220 ozzie so not too bad it's pretty
good from what I hear so I'm keen to
give that a go
I'll sit that down there well you reckon
was that good yeah it was all right yeah
throw that down there to worry about
that Jonna throw that right on the floor
you got it throwing stuff oh yeah that's
what we just got what about this once we
open this yeah well open this one this
was addressed to Matt not many clues as
to what it could be I know what it is
now very cool
I'll get to review this we don't do too
many of these sort of products in
Australia it is and there isn't much
controversy surrounding this company at
the moment VGA you're right it is there
gtx 1060 don't know if it's a special
OSI model or not let's take a quick look
at it
no probably be a review on this in a
week or two there's some stickers for
you very standard looking EVGA card I
can get it out whoa
Oh guys no backplate epic fail cool well
it's a good looking card big cooler
hopefully those VRMs are cooled well
under there actually looks like there's
thermal pads on the memory and the vrm
so shouldn't be any problems with that
card in the head
have you had enough fun unboxing boxes
you want to go do something else
I'm gonna put that back in there and put
those back in there too you want open
the big one okay
all right so so far we've pulled out the
graphics card and had a good look at
that I might try and find somewhere to
whack them on the shelf there get that
out of the way put the Box down the
ground for the other rubbish and what
have we got two boxes left so sort of
got through this pretty quickly
that's all right this is actually sent
from Thermaltake and if you remember
last episode I was asking them if they
wouldn't mind sending me one of their
water-cooling keeps I did um request the
hard pipe kit so I could do a similar
build to Matt's p3 they haven't set the
hard parts but that's not a problem I
can get them off them later but uh it's
a pretty pretty big box for the kit
level look what's in it and check it out
in case any of you guys are interested
interested in buying one of these so
very basic instructions it says there
ring fans I got to 120 millimeter fans
so there are GB ah
they set the same below I didn't
actually request the color same blue is
what Matt's got down there the
waterblock double Pacific w1 water block
I don't know if that's the same block I
think that's a different blue yeah Matt
had an acrylic block this is different
to the one who used so it's very very
heavy and it's got the mounting gear for
all the current Intel platforms and AMD
so that's the water block for the cpu V
tubular t4 tubes which I won't be using
I don't know that's the problem for
these fittings that they've sent
anyway I've got an assortment of
fittings this allows you do jumpstart
the power supply without actually
hooking anything up so you can check the
loop to make sure there's no leaks
without actually having to run any power
through all your bits so if there is a
leak you can clean it up hopefully let
it dry and it won't kill anything
hopefully we have a pump and reservoir
quite a big one there
d5 pump and the PR 22 reservoir and I
believe that's the same one Matt used I
really got at this point I need a knife
don't I well there was no knife handy
but I've got a rule a steel rule that
actually works really well anyway bit
sad but probably should have put some
pre-planning into a I'm gonna open the
boxes I'm still new to this okay I think
that is slightly different a little one
that had um he had an aluminium shroud
the whole way around the pump so
slightly different model but similar
result at the end of the day and all the
fittings to mount it and finally the
last thing in the Box is the RL 360
radiator so I've only got it's a three
Packer fan so that makes sense
three 120 millimeter fans will be
supported by this radiator Matt went
with a true 40 to 40 mil version of this
for his build I'm pretty sure and a few
of you guys were concerned that that
wouldn't be enough but then these things
are super thick they hold a lot of water
so that should work well it's got a plug
at the bottom to drain it few
instructions don't need those yeah so I
will probably do
some kind of build in the near future
probably on the channel with this stuff
and whatever else I can get my hands on
probably got motherboard memory see if
you've ever Scott a lot sort of stuff so
I'll just have to work out some sort of
interesting case to to use for the bill
but that should be pretty cool something
to look forward to something fun oh yes
we got a lot the plugs and the tool to
put them in and some screws to mount it
I'll move all this stuff over here
because this next box has a case in it I
guess will attack this with the ruler
same way alright so before we get into
it this is the in win 503 case it's been
out for a while now it's actually pretty
well priced this case and it it looks
very very cool so yeah incredibly this
case costs just 85 ozzie normally you
know when you see this case being $80
you would think it would be 80 US but it
isn't and I know this to be a good case
because I've got a system built in one I
got the red black one I don't actually
know what this one is let's find out but
it's another red black one lot of static
electricity on that
that's what I done we've lost a leg bill
quality is quite good ah they're screws
the screw is not in come on minor issue
corrected all right so on this side we
have a nice big acrylic window sticks
out so that gives you it's actually it
looks cool but it's also good because it
gives you a bit of extra Headroom on the
CPU cooler if you go for a big tower
style heater sink around the front well
uh you're ready you're gonna rip it off
that was painless this is actually I
believe tempered glass from memory yes
that's a tempered glass panel so I mean
485 ozzie that's a pretty cool feature
that won't probably they use plastic
gloss here or even some sort of our
critic is just the second you touch it
it's just scuffed up looks like rubbish
it looks awesome the second you peel the
protective plastic off and it lasts
about a second and when you start doing
stuff like this just that's it the next
time you got a wife but it's just
scuffed up and looks rubbish so it's
good to see an affordable case with a
material that's actually going to stand
the test of time and not look rubbish
the second you peel it off cool little
power button you've got only one USB
three which is a bit disappointing but
that seems to be sort of the norm on
these entry-level cases pair USB twos
and your audio jacks nice big power
button that's pretty cool and then you
can you can hide the 5.25 inch drive bay
if you want and that just opens up some
ventilation there so it's a pretty cool
case and then you've got the same sort
of bulging design on that side but
that's obviously an all steel door
okay so although it is mostly steel it's
very very light what are we gonna round
the back
now supply goes in the bottom we've got
six expansions seven actually but looks
like in transport
in a bit it bent out of shape
since the foot fell off the bottom I
think this could have been a habit
beaten up in transport actually it came
from
I think Taiwan I mean they've been back
out okay but still if you'd paid for
this you wouldn't really want it to be
kept out of the package might as well
have a look inside while we're here yeah
so inside looks like we can fit for 3.5
inch drives in these bays here you can
put a 2.5 inch on top and they're all
tooless by the looks of it all you need
2 screws to put the 2.5 inch in but
these are completely tool-less so that's
pretty cool
we've got three 5.25 inch drive bays at
the top only one is external so you put
an optical drive in there if you want
and if you're still into that but pretty
point was really for the most part power
supply goes here we've got external
ventilation with a removable dust filter
it looks like oh yeah and they're just
those cheap ones that you just press it
up but that's alright they were good
enough and I mean as I said it is an $85
computer case so you would do only get a
single 120 millimeter fan in the package
no that is completely wrong ignore
everything I just said it's a cheap case
but you get to 120 millimeter fans in
the package you get if I can pop this
off behind this easily to remove dust
filter hopefully it's easy to remove yes
it is another 120 120 millimeter intake
fans that's pretty cool yeah so the fact
that you get to 120 millimeter fans dust
filters all around you got the nice
tempered glass front panel which I
really like that's a cool feature in
this case and tool this drive bays
inside it all looks build quality looks
really good for the money so awesome
value case all around really couldn't be
doing some more
good angle yeah we go and pop this back
on Oh they've done this so it's pretty
cool the way I've done this you can
remove the front panel from my only
having to remove you know this case door
sort of hinges in on that side and then
you push it and it clips in so that's
cool you'll still have to be careful
with this this acrylic window because
that will scuff up fairly easy though it
looks like it is a good panel a good
quality panel but they won't be as
durable as that tempered glass front
panel adding a bit of durability so the
whole case isn't all floppy and flexi
they've bent the steel over at the i/o
panel here so you've got a fair bit of
strengths for the fan panel on stuff it
doesn't just you can see they've done it
again here it's not all just weak
so basically wherever there's a sort of
a thin bit of steel they've bent it to
add some strength so it's not just a
sloppy mess but there you go that's the
unboxing boxes quick review of the 805
it is the case I have used before though
not that recently it is it's been out
for quite a while now I think in this
case I remember it was probably was
either very early this year or late last
year I first got my hands on it but
overall awesome case for the money
really good value so I'm looking forward
to building another system in that one
and that pretty much concludes this
episode of unboxing boxes we save and we
had a few cool things to look at nothing
too extreme I think next week we should
have a lot more gear but for the rest of
this week we have a heap of cool content
coming up I think tomorrow I'll finally
have that GD x 1050 ti4 gig versus the
RX 464 gig and RX 474 gig cards and I'll
chuck in the 2 gig RX 460 and 1050 s
into that comparison as well just so you
can compare the results but that should
be pretty cool and I'll be updating that
with the new games that are coming out
titanfall 2 Call of Duty infinite
warfare and
to think that's about the only games
that have come out since I did the last
comparison anyway they'll be in there
and everything else I may have forgotten
and then later in the week we'll also
finally get you that $1200 u.s. 1440p
billed I think it's about 1900 ozzie and
that's in that cooler master cage the
asrock motherboard the core i5 6600 k GD
x 1050 and so on it's a it's a really
cool build for the money so I'm looking
forward to it done I'll probably set
that up on a 1440p monitor at the desk
here and show you what playing some
games and report on the performance and
that sort of stuff so that should be
pretty interesting well that's it for
unboxing boxes this week I hope it
wasn't too unorganized and the editing
made it bearable to watch if not though
hang in there because tomorrow night's
GPU comparison will be your Gooden so
until then take it easy and I'll catch
you tomorrow
see you guys
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
