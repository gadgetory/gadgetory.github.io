looking at forts of horizon for again
following on from steve's big GPU
benchmark of again that i think
hopefully went up on the channel
yesterday i'm pretty sure it did steve's
used to be pretty reliable to gain those
things out on time especially when it's
internet is actually working actually a
quick note on yesterday's video
Microsoft released a patch for 4-2
horizon for today that some people have
told us improves performance on Maxwell
cards as you might have seen GPUs likely
980ti didn't perform particularly well
in our testing but that might have been
fixed in today's patch so we're looking
into that at the moon anyway I've been
playing a bit of horizon as well I've
got to say it's a graphically beautiful
game one of the most visually stunning
racing games I've seen plus the
expensive open worlds always something
I'll have in racing games I haven't
played a lot just yet I'm still
finishing up shadow of the Tomb Raider
but I'm so glad this game is on PC
rather than just as a pure Xbox
exclusive and I've talked about the game
though today's view is a graphics
settings benchmark and optimization
guide for fought to horizon for what
that means is I've benchmarked nearly
every setting in the game so I can show
you the exact visual quality differences
between each of the settings as well as
how they perform the idea is to discover
the best balance of visuals and
performance to give you guys a set of
settings that is optimal for this game
at least in our opinion the performance
numbers will also hopefully save you
guys a bit of time benchmarking on your
setup you can simply take the
performance differences shown here
find the best settings for tweaking and
apply those to your game to squeeze more
out of your hardware a few quick notes
before we get into it firstly the graphs
coming up are in percentage games not
raw FPS because it better illustrates
how the setting tweaks apply to your
setup secondly we benchmarked with a
variety of GPUs from both Nvidia and AMD
high-end and mid-range and averaged out
the results so what you see here should
apply to roughly every GPU give or take
a few percentage points although our
Comment where there may be larger
differences for lower end GPUs thirdly
we did still test using our core i7 8700
K test rig overclocked to four point
gigahertz so we were entirely GPU bound
in this game and lastly all captured
words you see here is from an RT X xx
atti running the game at 4k and the
captured food for the most part isn't
where we benchmark the majority of the
tests were performed using the in game
benchmark aside from a few tests that
required actual gameplay
we also recommend watching this video at
youtube's maximum 4k quality or you can
download a source quality file from our
patreon page it's a little bit easy to
see the differences when you're viewing
at the maximum quality so let's start
with the presets the game has five of
them and then you can also push up a
variety of settings above the ultra
preset so we've added a sixth maximum
preset here which has everything cranked
up as high as it can go
however there's very little visual
difference between maximum and ultra so
we recommend just sticking to ultra judy
with 37 percent performance uplift you
get from shifting to ultra the
differences between ultra and high
aren't massive but it's clear that
enforcer horizon for ultra does provide
a quality upgrade whereas the ultra
preset in many other games is almost
indistinguishable from high here ultra
provides better card geometry improved
textures better lighting especially at
night and sharper cleaner reflections
high is very close to medium visually in
fact I found it very hard to split the
two while low takes everything down a
notch in terms of geometry textures and
lighting very low is the potato preset
which looks terrible with shadows turned
off entirely when looking at the
performance breakdown I have a couple of
recommendations for those that don't
want to tweak anything further and just
want to use a nice simple preset my
choice would be ultra due to the
noticeable quality improvement over high
Ultra is an especially good choice
because the Steve showed Ultra gives you
around 60fps at 1080p with the card like
a GTX 10 63 gigabyte or rx 570 while at
1440p the gtx 1070 pushes above 60fps if
you want to reduce quality to gain a ton
of performance I'd recommend skipping
high and going from medium the jump from
high to medium provides a 6 percent
performance improvement for nearly no
quality difference
medium is also a decent 32 percent
faster than ultra which brings some of
the lower end cards into play it's also
a good choice for high refresh gamers as
which
talking about a difference between say
90 and roughly 120 FPS es though
personally I would still take the higher
visual quality of ultra let's move now
to checking out the wealth of other
graphics options in Forza horizon 4 for
a bit of fine tuning some of these
settings have more impact than others so
we'll breeze through some of the more
straightforward ones also just quietly
it's a massive Android's happening this
aims for quite a full restart to change
even something basic like anisotropic
filtering requires a restart that's
pretty ridiculous I'm hoping anyway
let's get down to the list of settings
starting with anisotropic filtering
usually this setting has labels like 2x
+ 16 X but here we have just ultra high
and medium there are subtle differences
to the clarity of textures in all three
modes especially Road textures which are
a prime candidate to be cleaned up with
AF Ultra gives the best coyote while
with medium everything is a bit blurry
my advice with all games is to run
anisotropic filtering at the highest
possible setting and that's especially
important for racing games you only gain
one point two percent switching from
ultra to medium which simply isn't worth
it stick in an ultra unless you have a
low-end card that struggles with AF in
which case I turn it all the way down
night shadows only come into play at
night who would have thought anyway it
has the basic effect of your car's
headlights producing shadows when it
shines on other cars or scenery it's
quite a noticeable change one that
greatly improves the realism of the
game's lighting systems at night in the
benchmark which is half during the day
and half at night you gain two percent -
minimum frame rates from disabling night
shadows considering the large visual
difference it makes I'd leave them
enabled shadow quality is an interesting
one for - horizon 4 uses a shadow system
that increases in resolution and
crispness the more you turn up the
shadow setting while also providing some
distance based shadow softness there are
large differences between each mode
particularly in the shadowy forest areas
of the game extreme provides the sharper
shadows with a large draw distance Ultra
keeps closer shadows as sharp as extreme
while reducing shadow resolution for
further away shadows high and low both
reduced shadow resolution in successive
steps while off looks like crap so don't
use that mode interestingly car shadows
are independent of environment shadows
and it's only environment shadows that
are affected by this setting in terms of
performance shadows have
very little impact relative to the
quality difference turning from extreme
to low only improves frame rates by 1%
which isn't nearly enough to justify the
quality loss turning them off only gives
a three percent improvement 2 which
makes that setting completely worthless
my advice here is to use the extreme
option motion blur is always a
contentious option among gamers but I
think for racing games it does add to
the presentation considering the high
speeds you are moving at most of the
time there are two separate options for
motion blur one controls the quality of
the technique the other the shutter
speed there's no performance difference
between these short and long shutter
speeds but short looks better so we used
it for all testing in terms of quality
Ultra and high are both pretty similar
is when you move down to normal and low
that the sampling quality for the blur
reduces quite a bit low in particular
looks pretty bad aside from turning off
motion blur entirely which gives you a 5
percent boost to performance compared to
ultra would recommend using high as it
gives nearly the same visual quality as
ultra while giving a 2 percent
performance boost low isn't really worth
it as it only gives an extra one
percentage point for our large quality
drop environment extra quality is the
main texture control for the game this
dictates the clarity of textures for
close and far objects as is usually the
case the higher the better for this
setting especially on high resolution
displays where higher quality textures
are more noticeable Ultra definitely
gives the sharpest textures and choosing
a lower texture quality will only give
you a 2% performance boost at best so
it's not worth it the only reason I'd
lower the texture quality is if your
card is running out of VRAM but provided
you have 4 gigabytes or so you should be
fine for ultra textures at 1080p static
geometry quality appears to do nothing
visually or in terms of performance so
let's move on from this one I set it to
ultra high think this will get fixed in
an update to the game I should note as
well that this wasn't fixed in today's
October 1st patch the primary effect of
the dynamic geometry setting is
modifying how the crowd looks at races
in terms of overall population quality
and draw distance Xtreme has the highest
population highest quality crowds and
that falls with each setting down to low
where the crowd is pretty sparse
despite the visual difference I don't
think the crowd population matters all
that much as you're mostly focused on
the cars and
scenery while the people standing on the
sides of the road aren't exactly the
highest-quality simulations anyway we're
looking at performance you can gain a
handy three percent from turning it down
from high or ultra to just medium crowds
are a little less dense but in motion
it's hard to notice and I think it's
worth it for the performance improvement
multisample anti-aliasing or MSA is
always a big hitting effect in terms of
performance
it's the biggest enforcer horizon for
looking at this side-by-side comparison
here at 4k you definitely want to be
using at least two times MSAA
to smooth out edges and provide a
cleaner presentation but I don't think
four times is required at this
resolution a DX is basically no
different to 4x and consuming the large
performance hit it's definitely not
worth using speaking of that performance
hit you can see the differences it's
here shifting from 8 X to 2x will give
you a huge 14 percent performance
improvement for very similar visual
quality moving from 4 X 2 8 X is the
biggest loss in performance while moving
from 2 X 2 off isn't worth it
considering how bad off looks in
comparison to 2 X
I'd consider using 4 X on lower
resolution displays but my advice for
most users is 2 X
you can add FXAA to msaa for even more
anti-aliasing but in my opinion FXAA
does nothing in conjunction with higher
levels of MSAA while it only serves to
blur the image at low levels of msaa
and keep FXAA disabled if you're using
MSAA otherwise if you don't want to take
the performance hit from msaa unable
FXAA as it has basically no impact to
performance SS ao or screen space
ambient occlusion impacts shadowing and
the overall depth of the game world if
the setting you want to keep enables and
increasing it does have a noticeable
effect on the level of shadowing and
overall realism Ultra gives the best
results over high and medium while off
makes the world look a bit flat looking
at the performance breakdown I see no
reason to switch from ultra to high or
especially medium reducing the setting
only improves performance by 1% yet
Ultra looks noticeably better than high
medium is a useless setting as it looks
worse than high for no performance
improvement if you are struggling for
framerate I'd consider turning off SSAO
to gain 5% but most users should try to
keep it on
flection quality is important in this
game as there are so many reflective
surfaces particularly your own vehicle I
couldn't tell the difference between the
extreme and ultra modes but switching to
high reduces a reflection resolution and
draw distance the further you turn it
down the more the resolution and draw
distance is impacted looking at the
performance breakdown Ultra is the
slightly better option to use compared
to extreme moving to high does give a
1.5 percent improvement to performance
but that comes at the expense of a
slight reduction to visual quality
medium again doesn't seem worth touching
as it reduces quality for no performance
improvement low and very low are
settings you should only consider on
slower pcs my preference is to use ultra
consume the small quality gain over high
for a small performance loss the high is
also a decent choice depending on your
hardware I'm going to smash through the
next two because they only have a big
impact for those that use the cockpit
view windshield reflection qualities
should be kept on ultra there's only a
1% difference between ultra and off
while each step up increases the
reflection resolution mirror qualities
should also be kept on the maximum
extreme mode which is virtually
identical in performance to high for an
improvement to reflection draw distance
low cuts the draw distance massively for
a 2% improvement world's car level of
detail is a highly influential setting
both on visual quality and performance
as it determines the quality of the cars
basically the most important thing in
the game there's not a huge difference
from extreme to ultra but moving down to
high immediately gives you a lower
fidelity car model and low models for
other carts medium reduces the quality
of other cars further while low steps
everything down or overall when looking
at the performance breakdown yeah
turning this setting from ultra to high
does give a large 5% bump to performance
hopefully the cars in this game are so
well designed and from such a large part
of what you see that you should keep
this setting on ultra so you can enjoy
them in their full glory if you're not
hitting the frame rate you want though
turning it down to high isn't a massive
quality loss for the 5 percent gain in
performance deformable terrain quality
is the one setting that was too
difficult to benchmark and recommend
keeping it on ultra though screen space
reflections or SSI is one of these
settings that adds significant realism
to the lighting system in particular
reflections from surfaces like water
the difference between ultra and high
isn't that large you get slightly
reduced draw distance with high but it's
hard to spot most of the time there's a
very slight difference between high and
medium then shifting to low reduces draw
distance and resolution further turning
SSR off is a significant change and
looks pretty unnatural if you ask me
with SSR you get the largest performance
improvement simply switching from ultra
to high which I feel is absolutely worth
doing for the 5 percent performance gain
so I'd recommend using high here SSR off
is around the same performance as medium
for much worse visuals so I definitely
opted use at least medium SSI here if
not low if you need to up your
performance lens effects is one of those
settings where I couldn't really tell
the difference between the three main
modes off pretty clearly disables things
like water droplets on the screen but I
couldn't notice any difference between
the medium and ultra lens effects modes
turning it off may be your preference
from a visual standpoint if you don't
like lens effects but if you do I'd
suggest using the medium mode as it
gives a good three percent more
performance than ultra shader quality
has an incredibly subtle difference to
the way the game's lighting interacts
with surfaces I think it might also
control bloom as well to a small degree
overall though it's not a mode that has
a large impact
strangely there's a two percent
performance improvement going from ultra
to high despite barely any change to
visual so I'd recommend using high you
can gain a bit more shifting to low but
high is ever so slightly superior which
is why it's my choice the final setting
in the game is for particle effects this
one changes the amount of particles for
things like rain snow dust confetti so
on pretty easy choice here for which
salient to use there's no performance
difference between any of them to go
with high alright we're at the point now
where we've gone through basically every
quality setting in the game and giving
you all our thoughts on which ones are
the best in terms of balance between
quality and performance he's everything
to summarize for you so if you want to
use our optimal settings simply head
into for Sarai's and for settings and
use the exact settings you see on the
screen now these custom settings compare
favorably to ultra in terms of
performance but deliver high visual
quality in fact in our benchmark runs
our custom configure formed a fraction
better but in general you'll get ultra
preset performance which I feel this is
a pretty great place to be at
considering the large number of cards
that can play this game using ultra
settings at 1080p however in terms of
visual quality we sacrificed a few
things to see gains in other areas crowd
density lens effects and shadow quality
were all cut but it's that nearly no
impact of visual quality meanwhile we
managed to improve shadow quality SSAO
and reflections which all have a much
high impact to visuals particularly in
the open-world section of the game
overall we end up with subtle
improvements to quality for know
performance loss and that's a win I
reckon that's it for this graphics
optimization guide for 4 - horizon 4
hopefully you now know how every setting
performs so you can get the most out of
this game if such a stunning and fun
game if you into racing I think you need
