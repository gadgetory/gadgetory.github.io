since AMD released their Raven Ridge
APUs
I've been flooded with questions about
overclocking and cooling many of you
been wondering if I recommend buying an
aftermarket cooler and if so which one
if you plan on overclocking and you
really want to get the most out of your
2200 year 2400 G then I do indeed
recommend getting your hands on it
aftermarket cooler though of course you
will want to spend as little as possible
given these budget processes
so what cost-effective options are out
there well let's take a look starting
with some of my favorites
fees now D people's game acts 200 has
been one of the best value tower style
air coolers out there and yet chances
are you may never have heard of it in
terms of quality it's actually very
similar to the cooler master 212 and it
also costs a little bit less I believe
there was an issue with availability as
deep cool had virtually zero presence in
the US and Australia just four years ago
the original game ax 200 sold for what
was the equivalent of just 17 dollars us
back in 2014 and with a 92 millimeter
PWM fan and two direct contact heat
pipes it performed remarkably well the
new AM for compatible gamax 200 t takes
things to the next level and it does so
well barely increasing the retail price
American and Australian buyers are both
looking at spending around $20 for this
cooler making an incredibly good value
for what it is this relatively large air
cooler sports a unique looking 120
millimeter fan and two copper direct
touch heat pipes I've already found that
those wanting to overclock the Rison 320
200 G with the gamax 200 t can do so
while keeping low temps under sixty
degrees at all times not only are the
low temps great but when overclocking
this cooler is virtually silent as well
it's a real gem and a great value option
for 2200 G owners wanting to extract a
maximum performance value for money I
really don't think you can beat the game
ax 200 to you right now
especially when it's regularly on sale
for well under $20 u.s. and I've seen it
as low as $10 u.s.
The Crying m9 a mini Tower is an equally
good budget a.m. for cooler and right
now it can be had for around $20 us at
new egg and Amazon while Australians can
expect to pay about $30 which is
certainly very reasonable rather than up
for direct touch copper heat pipes the
m9 a features a nickel-plated pure
copper base which Craig says provides a
larger contact patch which is better at
spreading the heat to all the heat pipes
speaking of which this model features
three copper heat pipes which have also
been nickel-plated and this not only
protects the copper but it also makes
the m9 a look very shiny standing just
124 point six millimeters tall makes it
very compact and yet it weighs 425 grams
and that makes it 18% heavy and the
gamax 200t this is no doubt due to that
copper base and the extra heat pipe a
cryo reg says that the m9 a features the
same build quality materials and cooling
technology found in their more expensive
tower coolers I should just note though
it is important to note that any of you
wanting to use this cooler with a Raven
Ridge apu or any other am4 processor for
that matter you need to purchase the m9
a and not the m9 i as you might have
guessed the I means Intel and the a
means AMD although a little trickier for
consumers the advantage of offering
distinct models for AMD and Intel
platforms helps cryo rigs save on costs
don't have to provide extra mounting
gear that you're probably not going to
end up using finally in terms of build
quality I'm not really sure that there's
anything that beats the m9 a mini tower
at this price point
those of you who can't get your hands on
the game acts 200 T on the m9 a mini
tower a nice alternative is the cooler
master hyper t2 although it packs twice
as many heat pipes as the game acts 200
T I found that it runs a few degrees
warmer and it makes slightly more noise
that said it is also a few dollars
cheaper something worth noting is that
although the hyper t2 features a smaller
92 millimeter fan it's actually 7%
taller than the game ax 200 T thanks to
the two copper heat pipes that loop
through the top of the heatsink cooler
master says that these heat pipes
provide superior cooling performance and
therefore aren't there just to look cool
that's their story anyway and they're
sticking with it the hyper t2 is also
about 25% wider as well so don't expect
the 92 millimeter model to offer greater
compatibility still overall it's a
well-designed cooler featuring excellent
build quality and a two-year warranty
not bad for $17 us not bad at all
finally my fellow aziz though they won't
be able to find the hyper t2 instead we
get the hyper for 11 R for about $30
should all else fail the arctic freezer
12 will get the job done nicely though
depending on where situated availability
might be limited and as a result pricing
may not be that great over at new egg
can be had for $21 though it's a little
more pricey on Amazon selling for $28
this squatty little cooler measures 90
millimeters wide making it 13 percent
wider than the hyper t2 though it is 7
percent shorter standing just a hundred
and thirty millimeters tall this cooler
also features direct touch copper heat
pipes this time though we get three six
millimeter pipes in total they think
itself is made up of 45 aluminum fins
each measure 0.4 millimeters thick and
pushing air through them is a 92
millimeter fluid dynamic bearing fan
performance wise it won't have any
trouble keeping an overclocked Raven
Ridge APU cool and quiet it's been
demonstrated to keep a core i7 7600 K at
under 70 degrees when overclocked a 4.8
gigahertz using one point four volts
therefore it's a massive step up from
the AMD rate stealth box cooler and it's
just as easy to install as it uses the
same the back way
a big part of the Raven Ridge appeal is
the ability to make incredibly small
gaming PC's is you don't need a case
that supports a discreet graphics card
granted a mini ITX APU powered PC isn't
actually that cost-effective as there is
quite a price premium associated with
mini ITX motherboards and cases but
still as I said building a truly small
gaming PC has its appeal if you're going
to spend $100 plus on a mini ITX
motherboard and put it inside a quality
case you might want to upgrade the
cooler and if you don't want to use the
race stealth box cooler your options are
pretty limited and none of them are
particularly cheap I've narrowed it down
to one of two options the thermal take a
XP 100h muscle or the Nok 2nh l9x 65 the
a XP 100h muscle comes in at $45 u.s.
that's almost half the price of the
Rison 320 200 G so this might be a
better option for the 2400 G meanwhile
the knock to a cooler is also quite
pricey at $50 us both will laid over
clock either Raven Ridge APU to the max
and they're really about as good as
low-profile air coolers get they both
stand at just 65 millimeters tall and
both feature nickel plated copper bases
whereas the nock to a model has four
copper heat pipes a thermal right model
packs six it also has a bigger fan and
while not that important the x100 h
muscle also looks much better at least
in my opinion personally for all those
reasons I would pick the thermal write
cooler but they're both great low
profile options there you have it my
personal picks for keeping the array VII
GPUs cool and quiet whatever clocked
picking between the deep core gamax 200
T and cryo reg m9 a mini tower isn't
easy so my advice would be to go with
whichever is cheaper at the time of
purchase if they're priced much the same
then just get whichever one you prefer
the look of either way you can't really
go wrong finally if you've come across a
good budget cooler with a m4 support
that you think is worthy of making this
list and I obviously haven't included it
then please comment down below and I'll
do my best to check it out and that's
gonna do it for this one if you enjoyed
