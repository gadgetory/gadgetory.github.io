PC minding my own business and having
you think about what videos I might do
next at that moment that an email from
AMD came through revealing some rather
unexpected detail about their upcoming
thread Ripper CPUs there's also some
info about the soon-to-be-released
rising 3 CPUs as well but I was less
interested in that it's not hard to
imagine how that launch is going to turn
out I'll discuss that a little bit later
on anyway getting back to thread Ripper
the exciting one so the highlights there
included the clock speeds and the
pricing I was very surprised that AMD
revealed pricing information so soon I
like to build hype now well in advance
of a product release traditionally we
sort of get the pricing a day before the
review goes live so we have a couple of
days to get the review ready we're
trying to write the conclusion and we
don't know the prices so it makes it
very difficult but we have the pricing
so thank you AMD the orions thread
repair 1950 X and yeah it's a bit of a
mouthful is set to come in at just $1000
us the same price as the core I 9 7 100x
you might ask why is that a big deal
well while Intel's offering a 10 core 20
thread CP at that price AMD is serving
up a 16 called 32 monster at 60% more
cause for the same price and they also
announced some details for a thread
repass 1920 X model and that's a
slightly more affordable 12 core 24
thread CP for $800 us now both of these
CPUs are said to operate a maximum boost
frequency of four gear Hertz and have to
say that's amazing news the 1950 ex
sports a base frequency of 3.4 gigahertz
which is still very respectable while
the 1920 X should run no slower than 3.5
gigahertz
I should note though that we don't know
what the all core turbo frequencies are
just yet and we don't know how many
cores will boost to the maximum 4
gigahertz those clock speed
specifications complemented what we
already knew about the upcoming thread
Ripper CPUs but to quickly recap each
thread Ripper CPU tax to Zeppelin dies
and they're the same dies you'll find in
the F
server grade chips they use for of
course to allow for 32 cores and 64
threads each Zeppelin dye provides 32
gen 3 PCIe lanes for a total of 64 lanes
so you can pretty much connect up as
many graphics cards and high-speed MDMA
storage devices as you wish without
running into any old bandwidth of
limitations without a Zeppelin die there
are two CCX modules so technically
thread Ripper is just to rising CPU
stitch together or glued together as
Intel would so eloquently put it
actually glued until it's a bit strange
they are using fabric II so I would
believe stitching is the preferred
method anyway in total there are four
CCX units each offering four calls and
eight threads and essentially this means
you can double pretty much everything
risin seven has which enables a massive
32 megabyte level 3 cache and support
for quad channel memory as you might
imagine sticking to rising cpus together
is going to make for one massive cpu
that's exactly what thread river is an
absolutely massive cpu as such
AMD had to design a new platform to
accommodate the behemoth and that will
be supported by the cunningly named x3
99 chip set the new TR 4 socket uses
land grid array surface mount packaging
commonly referred to as LGA and this
means unlike arisin 5 and Rison 7 there
are no pins on the actual CPUs rather
pins have been moved over to the
motherboard and this is the same method
entails been using for quite a few years
now however whereas Intel's latest
high-end desktop CPUs utilized 2066 pins
thread repair demand and incredible 4090
for pins such an extreme desktop
platform demands a new name so
superseding Intel's high-end desktop or
h EDT we now have shed or s HC d which
is short for super high-end desktop aim
DS also said that the threatened 4 CPUs
will become available in early August
which is great news but there was no
mention of a technical apart at least at
this stage so this means you better buy
one of Andy's super high-end desktop
processors very soon for a very
reasonable price but the question is
should you obviously we can't really
answer that question till we for
Lee tester gripper but as it stands
right now potential buyers do have the
option to just pull the trigger on the
Coraline 70 100 X and call today rather
than wait for three refer and as always
with a new product incoming
I highly recommend you don't do that
helping you hold off AMD did run a quick
Cinebench r15 demo featuring both Red
River models and compared the results
through the Quran I know 7900 the 7 100x
scored 2167 points which is consistent
with my own findings I reported a score
of 2,200 one points in my review and I'd
say that's within the mouth margin of
error it's like 2% or something the 12
core 19:20 expert had an impressive
score of 2431 points and to match that
the 70 100x would need to be overclocked
to 4.7 gigahertz where it consumes an
awful amount of power pretty much enough
to embarrass your wall heater then the
big guy the 1950 ax that turned in an
absolutely incredible score of 3060 2
points and while breathtaking wasn't
entirely surprising giving that the 1800
x manages around 1600 points still this
means for workloads that do utilize or
can utilize the 1950 X's many cause
should be around 40% faster than the
core I 970 900 X that quite frankly is a
massive performance difference for a CP
of the same price so should you wait a
few weeks for thread Ripper before
making your ultimate choice hell yeah as
I see it a me really has Intel in a
serious spot of bother with these high
core count CPUs when it comes to gaming
there's still no question of the quad
core Core i7 77 ok still rules them all
for now anyway
this however goes beyond gaming anyone
seeking a CPU with 8 cores or more
probably isn't gaining or at least
they're not just gaming and when we talk
about 10 core CPU such as the 1700 X
gaming really isn't a consideration and
this is of course true for the 12 core
and 16 core thread Ripper CPUs as well
so if you're not gaming I know it's hard
to imagine and you do require a high
coil count CPU for things such as
encouraging and rendering for example
then you really do want as many cause as
you can afford as we just saw with
Cinebench
Ami's Hyeok or cap 1950 X takes the 7900
X to the cleaners and again for the same
price of course we are yet to catch
Ripper for ourselves but given what we
know about risin 70 Intel's Clorox
lineup I just don't see how Intel can
compete in the current high-end desktop
market given their current pricing
strategy as a side note I would like to
know if the 12 core model features the
same 32 megabyte level 3 cache as the 16
core model that wasn't made clear I
assume it does but we won't know for
sure until AMD confirms it they also
haven't confirmed the CCX configuration
for the 12 core model again I'd assume
we're looking at three cores per cc X
but again Amy hasn't confirmed this we
also don't know what the official ddr4
memory support is yet again I'd assume
gr for 2666 based of what we've seen
from Verizon so far and it has been
suggested that the CPUs will support an
insane 1 terabytes of memory so yeah
that's pretty crazy for a desktop CPU
finally I'm not sure if the CPUs come
bundled with a cooler or not or if
existing pools can be adapted to the new
sockets I'll have to wait to find out
that as well finally Andy also announced
the horizon 3 thirteen hundred and
twelve hundred the 1300 will operate at
a base frequency of 3.5 gigahertz widow
to about 3.7 units while the 1200 will
run at 3.1 Gigot the two above 3.4
gigahertz no pricing info was given but
on D says these CPUs will be available
next week on the 27th and I'll throw up
a graph with a few more specs about the
CPUs but basically you're looking at
what I believe is a rising fire 1400
with SMT disabled anyway before rising
is officially released I will be doing a
simulated rise in three benchmark video
to check out how these chips perform and
I'll be using the rising 5 1400 with SMT
disabled so there should be really no
surprises there as it turns out I'd
actually gathered the results about a
week ago I was planning on doing the
video pretty much early this week
they've made the announcement so yeah
didn't really go to plan and I didn't
realize they'd be released the week
after the announcement but whatever I'll
still release my simulated benchmarks
because
are very telling and I believe them to
be very accurate anyway that's going to
do it for this one
