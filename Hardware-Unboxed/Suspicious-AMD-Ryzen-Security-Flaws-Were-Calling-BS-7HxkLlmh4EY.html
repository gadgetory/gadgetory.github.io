earlier today some interesting news
broke surrounding AMD Rison security
flaws a company called cts labs posted a
white paper revealing four classes of
vulnerabilities that affect risin risin
Pro Rison mobile and epic curiously CTS
labs only gave AMD 24 hours notice
before publishing this white paper
rather than 90 days or longer which is
standard practice in the security
industry and a bit more on that later I
first wanted to cover the flaws and give
you guys a rundown of what has
apparently been uncovered as I mentioned
there are four classes of vulnerability
labeled master key Chmura rise and fall
and fall out each with a couple of
variants there's a fantastic article
over on Anandtech that covers each of
these variants so check that out but I
will summarize it all here for you
so master key is the first vulnerability
and it allows arbitrary code execution
in the secure processor on epic and
Rison processes provided the attacker
reflash 'as the bios to target the arm
cortex a5 integrated into these CPUs the
exploit could allow an attacker to
disable and ease security features cts
labs claims this has been successfully
exploited on Rison and epic with Rison
Pro and rise in mobile potentially
affected Chmura
revolves around the promontory chipset
which could allow remote code execution
on the chipset that could attack devices
connected through it like USB SATA PCIe
and so forth the exploit is possible on
risin and risin Pro by running malware
with both elevated administrator
privileges and a digitally signed driver
rise and fall exploits the AMD secure OS
by leveraging arm trust zone with
elevated administrator privileges and a
vendor supplied driver it's possible to
exploit the secure processor to
arbitrarily execute code disable memory
protection and authorize protected
memory reads and writes epoch is not
affected here but Rison is too
varying degrees and the last one is
fallout it's an epic only vulnerability
similar to rise and fall in its results
that requires compromising the
bootloader and again requires elevated
administrator access and assigned driver
so those are the flaws that have been
uncovered now I'm not a security expert
or a hacker but I have been following a
bit of the discussion in the security
space about these exploits and to put it
simply there are red flags everywhere
firstly I'll circle back to AMD only
being given 24 hours notice of these
security flaws the standard practice is
to give companies 90 days notice so they
can prepare security patches such that
systems are protected before word of the
vulnerability reaches the public in the
case of meltdown inspector which became
public earlier this year
AMD Intel arm and others received almost
six months notice before everything was
disclosed CTS labs gave basically no
reason for only providing 24 hours
notice other than saying it's a Public
Interest Disclosure I don't really see
how this particular set of
vulnerabilities is more of a public
interest than other disclosures that
have seen companies get much more notice
and it's no surprise that in Amy's
official statement on the matter
they say this company was previously
unknown to AMD and we find it unusual
for a security firm to publish its
research to the press without providing
a reasonable amount of time for the
company to investigate and address its
findings and of course M they are
actively investigating and analyzing the
findings right now when we asked AMD for
a comment on the manner the vibe we got
is AMD had no prior warning about these
vulnerabilities and have been completely
blindsided there are a couple of other
unusual things about CTS labs the
company was founded in 2017 so they're a
relatively new player and they have no
prior reputation in the security space
in fact this is their first report their
website on these vulnerabilities AMD
flaws calm yes they did by AMD floors
calm is quite well put together there's
nice graphics again unusual for security
disclosures typically we just get a
white paper with CVE numbers
but here there are no CVE references and
instead a visually beautiful website in
CTS labs legal disclaimer the company
says this although we have a good faith
belief in our analysis and believe it to
be objective and unbiased you are
advised that we may have either directly
or indirectly an economic interest in
the performance of the securities of the
companies whose products are the subject
of our reports so a company is founded
in 2017 releases one report focusing on
AMD vulnerabilities and in their legal
disclaimer they say they may have an
economic interest in the securities of
the companies they are reporting on I
wonder what company they might have an
economic interest in now this is just
pure speculation on my part here but it
seems like CTS labs have released news
of these vulnerabilities in the hopes
that AMD stock will take a dive allowing
the founders of the company and other
invested parties to profit everything
has been nicely constructed for the
media through their website allowing
reporters to easily warn the public
about these issues which allows the news
to spread and aim the investors to worry
again just speculation but the legal
disclaimer lack of notice given to AMD
and company history do paint a pretty
dodgy picture and let's look a bit
closer at the vulnerabilities that were
disclosed now I should note here that
the white paper is very light on
technical details and examples on how to
use these exports things that are
usually found in other disclosures in
fact the CTO of CTS labs says we are not
putting our technical details and have
no intention of putting out technical
details ever more red flags but let's
move on so the first vulnerability
masterkey requires the attacker reflash
the system bios now I'm not a security
expert but you can do a hell of a lot of
things with someone's system if you're
able to flash their BIOS in fact if you
just give me the physical access to
someone's system that is required to
flash up by us along with the
appropriate privileges to do so I'll
probably be able to steal your data and
run whatever code I like again not an
expert but if I can flash a BIOS I can
probably
do a lot of other things rise and fall
and fall out both require
vendor-supplied
signed drivers along with elevated
administrator privileges again you can
do a lot of things with a booby-trap
signed driver and admin privileges it
doesn't exactly surprise me that with
this level of access you can do things
like execute arbitrary code and access
protected memory installing a signed
drive occurs pretty deep access to a
system in fact I wouldn't be surprised
at all if on an Intel system you could
do similar malicious activities with
BIOS flashes and sign drivers but these
exploits only talk about AMD again a bit
of speculation here but there are red
flags everywhere with this situation now
it is possible and even likely that
these vulnerabilities are legitimate but
the actual security risk doesn't seem
that high when we're talking about
needing BIOS Flash's admin privileges
and sign drivers and it seems that
security experts along with Linux
mastermind Linus Torvalds agree is that
this disclosure is a bit dodgy to say
the least so let's summarize the
situation as it stands right now
CTS Labs a company founded in 2017
released their first white paper
detailing Rison and epic vulnerabilities
after giving AMD basically no notice
there are no CVE tags for these
vulnerabilities CTS Labs does not and
will not release technical details and
their website mentions there may have
financial interests in the companies
they are reporting on the
vulnerabilities themselves require
significant levels of access such as
sign drivers admin privileges and the
ability to flash a BIOS I'm sure more
will come out in relation to these
vulnerabilities in the coming days but
right now looking at all the facts of
what has been disclosed I'm very
suspicious of this whole situation will
continue to monitor all the reports that
come out in relation to these am be
vulnerable ease and keep you guys
informed let us know what you think of
this whole situation in the comments
below and I'll catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
