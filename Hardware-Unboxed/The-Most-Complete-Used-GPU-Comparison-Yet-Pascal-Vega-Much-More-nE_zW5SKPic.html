what is is it my first my second view of
2019
yeah suppose it doesn't really matter
what does matter is the fact that I've
just had a loads and loads of fun making
this video yeah hopefully the video is
more enjoyable than what went into
making it anyway for this video I've
just spent tons and tons and tons of
time going over completed eBay listings
so graphics cards that sold in December
of 2018 I'll look to roughly 60
different graphics cards or 60 different
GPU classes and then a whole heap of
graphics cards within each class say it
basically short story I've looked over
thousands upon thousands of used
graphics cards on eBay the reason I've
done this is not because I enjoy
torturing myself but it is to provide
you guys with what I'm hoping will be
the ultimate used graphics card guide
going into 2019 so at least for the
start of 2019 anyway
and he'll work up the courage I might do
it again halfway through the year anyway
this video should provide you with all
the facts and figures you could possibly
need to snag a second hand graphics card
at the right price and I've gone
I suppose that extra mile by working out
how good your chances are of finding a
particular model at what should be a
reasonable price so that way you should
know where to invest your time what
models are worth looking into and what
aren't so what the pricing figures are
based on when I found on ebay.com
so the US version of our website looking
at sold auctions in December 2018 I've
tallied up all the sales and we'll be
presenting that data as an average sale
price and using that data again to
compare against the performance numbers
I have to calculate the cost per frame
for testing frame rate performance I've
used games that have proven to be a
fairly neutral and by that I mean don't
favor one particular brand of GPUs I've
done this by taking one of my big 30
plus game benchmarks looked at tiles
where the gtx 1060 and i rx5 eddie along
with the gtx 1070 and Vega 50
six delivered a similar level of
performance this led me to choose
battlefield 1 f1 2017 and rise of the
Tomb Raider all of which were test used
in the DirectX 11 API with the medium
quality preset enabled at 1080p frame
rates for all the graphics cards were
higher in battlefield 1 and F 1 2017
while they were about 35% lower in term
rater
so this caused some issues with the
lower end models still I feel this is a
good spread of what you can expect from
modern games are using mild quality
settings so here's a look at the data
for the GeForce GPUs the GTX 560 and 562
I were basically unable to play these
modern tiles at 1080p while the opposite
end of the scale we have the gtx 1080i
miles out in front as its roughly
equivalent to the new r-tx 2080
using the medium quality preset in the
three tiles tested we saw for around 60
FPS on average gamers can get away with
either a gtx 950 76010 59 66 70 or
obviously anything that was higher up on
the graph for the Radeon GPUs we see
that vega 56 and 64 and were well out in
front while the previous generation fury
GPUs were only just able to edge out the
RX 580 we see strong performance from
the r9 290 390 and RX 570 as well as
anything obviously situated above them
on the graft for around 60fps the HD
7870 or refresh 270x will work while the
HD 7950 r9 280 380 and anything faster
on the graph will be more than adequate
while using these mid-range quality
settings lumping them all together we
get this super big graph which I will
provide over on our patreon page for
free
so if you wish to take a closer look
then you can do by the link in the video
description anyway for the first time
I'm trying this stretched out scrolling
type graph in our videos and I think for
this kind of content this is probably
fine I'm not much we really need to
discuss here anyway this is really just
for a reference a quick and easy way for
you to get a rough idea of how a certain
model or even models stack up ok so
there's all the performance numbers and
I'd say that somewhat useful information
just by itself as it does allow you to
quickly determine and what's still worth
buying
now that we've got a lot it's time to
see what each model sold for on average
in December and how many sold at auction
and then we'll compare that information
with the performance information and
that will give us price versus
performance or cost per frame for this I
have another big scroll in graph but
before we start moving down to check out
all the models now let's just go over a
few things so obviously to the left we
have the GPU model and at the top you
can see the GeForce GTX 1082 as it is
the fastest and all the data is arranged
by the average frame rate next to the
GPU model name we have the average
selling price in December in the case of
the GTX 1082 I that price is 618 dollars
u.s. then in the darker gray field we
have another number and this number
represents the number of successful
auctions ignoring any defective products
being sold as parts so again in the case
of the 1080i we see that there were 715
second hand models sold last month so
your chances of snagging one for around
the average selling price is very good
at 618 dollars u.s. the todai-ji can be
had at a cost of 2 dollars and 32 cents
per frame based on the data from our
three-game average that actually makes
it one of the more expensive models in
terms of cost per frame but it's also by
far the fastest so that premium is often
justified by gamers with our TX 2080
models selling for around the $700 a US
MSRP you really want to spend under $600
on a used 10 atti
there are quite a few models for around
550 dollars and I even saw one that sold
for as low as four hundred and fifteen
dollars u.s. so there are some nice
bargains to be had
still it's shocking how many sold for
close or even over $700 u.s. last month
it's very odd that one anyway for those
of you wondering at four hundred and
fifteen dollars which was the cheapest
price I saw one sell for last month and
the gtx 980ti comes out at a cost of $1
56 per frame and then two dollars per
frame at a hundred and fifty dollars so
feel free to make your own calculations
based on pricing in your region for
those after a high-end bargain the GTX
1080 is worth looking into the 1072 eyes
are arguably better value but in
December there were many more 1080s on
sale the average selling price was 372
but quite a few sold for much closer to
$300 even at the average selling price
the 1080 comes out at a cost of just one
dollar and 84 cents per frame
that's very good relative to other
high-end GPUs again especially given how
many of them were on sale still for
those are for an affordable 1440p
experience getting a secondhand gtx 1070
or Vega 56 graphics card probably is the
way to go that said your chances of
landing a geforce card are almost seven
times better
the 980ti also looks to be great value
though there weren't that many of them
on sale about the same amount that we
saw for Vega 56 for over 100 FPS in our
3 game average the ultimate bang for
your buck really is the r9 290 at just
74 cents per frame and an average sale
price of just $78 it really is an
incredible bargain sadly most of the
models I saw that were successfully sold
I did use the extremely loud AMD
reference design but still for $78 you
could probably make do that said though
for a very very small price increase the
RX 570 is a better Buy and there were
loads more of them on sale as well
making them much easier prior to pick up
$94 on average it's a little over $50
off from a brand new model which isn't
bad it's a 37 percent discount
I should also jump back a bit and
mention that the r9 fury is also
excellent value at 130 dollars and the
only issue being that very few of them
went up for sale looking at the 67 to 88
FPS range the GTX 770 r9 285 and GTX 670
our standout options however having said
that there were basically no 285 s on
sale so you can probably ignore those
the GTX 670 sold for 66 dollars on
average but honestly I'd avoid those as
well and go for the GTX 770 for a few
more dollars from the 50 to 60 FPS range
standouts include the r7 265 270 HD 7870
and r9 270x we can scratch the 265 off
since just a single model was sold I'd
also avoid the 270 since the 78 70 and
270x were better in terms of cost per
frame and we're only a few dollars more
overall so I'd recommend you look out
for either of those model
below 50 FPS you've got to be desperate
if I'm honest I mean the HD 7870 and
270x sold on average for just 51 dollars
in fact there really isn't anything
lower that makes sense the gtx 750ti for
example solve 9 dollars more on average
and it's much slower so really no point
getting one of those
so to recap these in the models I'd be
on the lookout for and of course you can
pay attention to other models if they
provide the level of performance you
want because well there's often bargains
to be had like the four hundred and
fifteen dollar GTX at 1080 Ti but based
on what I was mostly seeing you have a
good chance of getting one of these
models for around the average selling
price if not better
basically I removed anything that
typically offered a poor cost per frame
ratio or there were less than 20 models
sold last month well that should point
you in the right direction for buying a
used graphics card there certainly are
loads of options but I think we have
narrowed it down to some of the better
options out there and not just better
options but also those that are more
easily acquired
so models that you have a good chance of
buying at a reasonable price and just as
a side note quite a few of these
graphics cards do come with various very
own configurations take the RX 570 for
example you can get that in for 8
gigabyte at capacities and often on the
used market I was noticing that the they
kind of carry the same sort of prices
that you're not really paying much of a
premium for the bigger vram cards so
yeah keep an eye on that if there is a
big premium for any particular model
you're looking at them you you you
decide which one you should get but I
found with the 570s often it was only 10
to 20 dollars more for the 8 gigabyte
model and sometimes that gigabyte models
were selling for less than the full
gigabyte models I mean that's the very
nature of options I guess so be aware of
what the vram options are and yet keep
an eye on those with bigger beefier
capacities because they might be worth
investing in speaking of which I would
probably recommend avoiding cards with
only 2 gigabytes of vram you can get by
with those kinds of cards by lowering
things like the resolution texture
settings all that sort of stuff but if
you don't want to compromise on those
things
textures really can impact how a game
looks then I would recommend getting at
least four gigabytes of vram for those
of you that are gaming at 1080p anyway
that is going to do it for this one I
hope you found this video useful because
yeah it was loads of work and it was
very tedious and if I'm honest it really
wasn't a whole lot of fun not like those
big benchmark sessions but yeah it was
kind of interesting doing it but yeah
just not yeah not a whole lot of fun so
anyway I did it because I'm hoping it
will really help those of you who are
looking to file use graphics card and
get your hands on one for the right
price so yeah speaking of which if you
have bought a used graphics card and
you've used this guide then let us know
below what you're able to snag and for
how much and all that sort of stuff
because yeah that would be that'd be
really cool to hear and yep just the
