pretty exciting video for you guys today
I'm able to give away another full
gaming PC and boy oh boy is this one a
Gooden
you might recall just before aim D
released there be 450 chip set or at
least their motherboard partners
released it for them we've got the MSI B
450 tomahawk motherboard and their new
Radeon RX 5 Eddy mech 2 8 gigabyte
overseed graphics card I threw that
Hardware along with the Verizon seven
twenty seven hundred 32 gigabytes of
ddr4 memory 36-hundred stuff and it's
RGB 480 gigabyte SSD see Sonic's focus
gold 650 watt power supply and the
awesome looking deep cool castle 240
millimeter all-in-one liquid cooler and
of course that all inside the MSI mag
pylon ATX case in my opinion this really
is a fantastic build consisting of
higher quality hardware as I said MSI
provided the case the motherboard and
the graphics card then a data came to
the rescue with 32 gigabytes of their
ddr4 3600 spectryx d41 RGB memory as
well as the gamax s11 480 by nvme SSD
all I needed to complete the system was
a power supply and since the focus gold
was just laying around not doing too
much and it is a perfect pairing for
this build I thought why not throw that
in the wraith spire wasn't really gonna
do it for this one either i couldn't
really imagine putting a box cooler in
this build and again i had the deep cool
castle spare so another product just
sitting around not doing too much and i
included that one not just because it
looks amazing as you can see for
yourself but because it also performs
really well and we did test it out in
this build as great as this gaming rig
looks the truth is I was planning on
reclaiming all the parts after creating
the content piece the build video that
you've hopefully already seen and then I
was just going to redistribute those
parts across all the various test
systems I have or I suppose I could have
just kept it as an amp or test system it
turns out that I don't really need to do
any of that already have to complete a
and four test systems so don't really
have a need for a third one and I don't
really need the parts either because
I've got all I need from other systems
so I thought I couldn't give it away to
a friend or a
family member I thought about that a bit
more and sort of went no we could give
it away to our viewer I think that'd be
a bit more exciting for you guys
of course as usual the only catch here
being that shipping something like this
potentially just about anywhere in the
world is extremely expensive and it's
not something that I can really afford
to cop myself so I got on the phone to
my msi contact pitch the idea and they
were really happy to go ahead with this
support the giveaway so big thank you to
msi for fully covering at the cost of
shipping so that being the case msi has
set up a gleam io page where you can
enter to win this beauty so it's free to
enter pretty sweet deal that the only
sort of touches that it's kind of region
locked i would have liked to have just
made it global and open to everyone but
it wasn't really possible to do on this
occasion so i am sorry about that
please understand these things are very
difficult to do having said that it is
open to Australia New Zealand United
Kingdom Canada and United States so
apologies to those of you who are
missing out I do sincerely apologize
it's just not feasible or possible for
me to make this one a global giveaway
even with MSI helping out so again sorry
about that but at least in this instance
we're not limited to just Aussie viewers
anyway it's a phenomenal giveaway in my
opinion the system comes in at about
1500 us or 2200 Australian so I am
giving away a really sweet gaming rig
here so hope you guys appreciate that
and if you missed the build video I will
quickly run the build sequence now
before wrapping this video up so yeah if
you haven't seen that well here it is
and if you have seen it you can probably
skip this part or you can just jump down
the video description and enter to win
not sure how many of you made it to this
point in the video but for those of you
that did thank you very much we
appreciate the watch time and your
support
so remember link is in the video
description you can enter there it's
free to enter all you have to do is be
subscribed to the channel pretty easy
stuff hopefully already if not that's a
good incentive feel free to like the
video if you want to do that comment
down below let me know if you want to
say anything because that's kind of what
the comments are for and yeah thanks
again for watching I'm your host Steve
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
